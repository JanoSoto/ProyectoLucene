We then are introduced to Xander Cage who is apparently an extreme sports legend. We (the audience) know this because he jumps off a bridge and Tony Hawks (not the one who dragged a fridge round Ireland) and Matt Hoffman kiss his ass. He has also never &#145;sold out' which we know because a busty businesswoman tries to get him to endorse his own computer game (something the two above have made a fair few dollars from doing).

After seeing it, I'm wondering what all the fuss is about. Boondock Saints borrows so liberally from the visual\/narrative techniques of Tarantino, Fincher, Smith, Ritchie, etc. it's almost embarrassing. Fragmented narratives, ultra-hip protagonists, kinetic montages, the F-word every other sentence -- it just seems done to death by now, especially when executed by what seems like the How to be a Cool 90s Filmmaker handbook. The two leads double-fist handguns like a pair of Chow-Yun McFats and have enough time to get in some witty, at times pop-culture concerned, repartee. People get into tough guy shouting match confrontations because that's what all tough protagonists have done since the early-mid-90s. Dafoe's FBI agent character listens to opera when trying to figure a crime scene so it'll lend an air of pseudo-artsy-fartsiness that people will mistake for some form of profundity -- the religious aspect also seems added for a similar reason.Still, the movie does have it's brighter moments. When Boondock Saints stops aping other movies and comes into its own, the film actually starts to get good. The moral ambivalence of vigilante justice is an interesting notion, but it hardly gets developed in the film until the very end. This issue is passed over instead for shouting matches and flashback-driven fragmented narratives. If the movie just didn't try so hard to be edgy and just tried to be true to its material, a better movie more worthy of such praise would have been the end result.If only Boondock Saints had just been itself (a rather modest crime and vigilante movie) and not what it turned out to be (a flick too hip for its own good), maybe then I'd see what all the hype was about. It is an entertaining movie, but in my opinion is not on the same level as the movies and filmmakers it so blatantly takes from. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 January 2003","score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":"  Almost everyone I know has been raving about this movie for some time.

I understand that the original Psycho might be infinitely better. May be. But why don't you just forget about the original for a second and rate this new film for what it is. I would give it 8\/10 at least. It's an excellent horror movie, without any glaring mistakes. It is truly scary. What more do you want?The characters were believable, the acting was good. I had absolutely no problem whatsoever with it being shot in colour. I think that is ridiculous to claim that just because it is in colour, it is immediately worse than the B\/W original. Come on!And once again. Be objective! Or try to be objective. At least pretend to be trying... THIS IS NOT A BAD MOVIE. May be it not the Mona Lisa of movies, but this is a REALLY DAMN GOOD film. The fact that it is a copy doesn't make it bad. The fact that it is a shot by shot remake doesn't make it bad. Judge the film for what it's worth. And this film is worth at least 8 out of 10.

He has beautifully brought to the world an image of Vietnam other than that of some evil Communists in American war movies.Now onto my review of this film.It is a beautifully shot movie.  The fresh, cool colors through the movie really do transport the viewer to somewhere similar to a tropical paradise. The story is slow but the writing is smart.  Things are happening even though you feel like nothing has happened.  The film is about 3 sisters and their adventures in love.  The two older are married and are facing infidelity in their relationships.  The youngest is still dating other men, although her close relationship with her brother only suggests some disturbing truth.The acting is the movie is restrained but mostly good.  My only problem is with Tran Nu Yen Khe as the youngest sister.  I know that she is the director's wife, thus she appears in all his movie.  But is this necessary, Tran Anh Hung?  She is certainly a beautiful actress, but her Vietnamese is horrible.  While everyone in the movie is speaking flawless, authentic Vietnamese, she struggles as if reading with a monotone in an accent that clearly indicates that she never learns Vietnamese in Vietnam.  This has completely thrown me off during the movie.  Whenever she speaks, I am reminded that this is a movie and not real.  In Mui Du Du Xanh, the first film of Tran Anh Hung, I don't have a real problem because she speaks a total of maybe 3 lines and those are from reading a book so it doesn't bother me.  But in Cyclo, while the actors and actress who play her family speak with a specific accent from a province in Vietnam (Quang Nam), she again speaks in a monotone with an accent of a foreigner.  And it happens again here in this film.  This problem is equivalent to an actor who plays an authentic Texan and speaks with a European accent.  It just doesn't make sense.

Not there are any, but just in case. Okay, now onto BTTFIII. I want to express my particular outrage at this movie. Yeah, you've all read it before; I don't hate BTTF movies, I love them, but this one just doesn't belong in the same league as the others. And having the standard set so high with the first two films is insignificant in this case This movie simply isn't very good. And this is where my outrage lies. This is a movie that tries to be science fiction, but it doesn't have enough sci-fi elements to justify being in the genre, apart from the time travel gags introduced in the previous two movies. This movie also tries to be a Western but is obviously so clichéd and routine that apparently this story was conceived on the parts of both Zemeckis and Gale to satiate some childish filmmakers' fancy to do a Western movie. I don't have evidence to support this, but that doesn't mean it hardly makes sense. Look at Zemeckis's career up to the present day. Notice the kinds of projects he takes, the styles he employs, and the techniques he likes to use. None of the above indicate he has any talent to create a fine, Western epic. Then you have the subtle Western homages, like the inclusion of Patt Buttram as Roger Ebert pointed out in his review, and Doc Brown's line in Part I that said he intended to visit his favorite period in time, the Old West, may in fact be sentiment of Zemeckis and\/or Gale. All I'm saying is that maybe Zemeckis wanted to do a Western someday, but knowing he didn't have the talent create a success from a pure Western, he decided to roll that idea into part of something more understandably crazy, a BTTF movie...Then maybe we'd all forgive him because he made a sci-fi film first and foremost, not a Western...Unfortunately, this particular story fits in very oddly with the rest of the trilogy. Ebert also stated how the other two were non-linear in their story telling, that all the time travel made for a story that flipped itself inside out while we all smiled at its eccentricity. (Part II was especially time travel madness heaven.) Apart from the scenes in the beginning of this film, which continues directly from Part II, the plot is extremely straightforward, with you classic action movie suspense devices with an Old West twist. Time travel is discussed as means of creating a purpose and direction for the plot, but no time traveling actually occurs after the beginning until final few minutes. BTTF's classic humor is ALL that saves this film from being unwatchable trash. And that brings me to another grievance The nauseating recycling of established BTTF gags. This was a serious problem with the second movie, where you could easily pick out which gags from Part I were adapted into Part II, and there were far too many instances of those. The problem even blemished Part I, as a few jokes from early in the movie were rehashed later on, which aroused a slightly uncomfortable sense of superfluous repetition. Now this is not necessarily a bad technique, as it can make fans of a film franchise feel at home with all of the in-jokes; it's also just plain amusing to see how story of one movie connects almost directly with another in the series through some small detail. Unfortunately, this technique is extremely difficult to do effectively, and sadly the BTTF movies generally fail with it. Moving on, this film has a much more emphasized love story. Whereas Part II had elements of romance but no real love story, and Part I had a love story that merely served as a fuel for many gags, plot twists, and heck, the entire story. Part I's love story obviously wasn't meant in any way to be heartwarming to romance fans out there. This is quite different in Part III, where tremendous care has been taken to make this offbeat romance at least the slightest bit touching by inserting in all those cutesy google-eyed exchanges, that overplayed kiss under the stars, and of course, the internal debate whether to do what is right according to the principles of science or to give into to needs of the heart. However, in this film, the romance isn't warm like the filmmakers' might've wanted it to be, it's just plain freaky, and I don't mean in the guilty-pleasure S&M kind of way; it's romance between an eccentric old scientist (one of the last men you'd expect in a Hollywood romance) and an equally eccentric woman (which becomes more and more apparent as the movie goes on For instance, **SPOILER** when the Doc tells Clara that he's from the future and he must return, instead of slapping or laughing at him thinking he's crazy, she gets upset because she thinks he has made up a Jules Verne-type fantasy to exploit her own imagination and break up with her with minimal heartbreak. Then, she stops the train on which she's leaving town just so she could run out and try to catch Brown before he's gone forever, and then she totally loses all semblance of sanity when she chases down and gets on the runaway train, recklessly risking her life just to catch up with Brown.), and that is HARDLY heartstring-tugging in my book. My biggest problem with this movie is its ending, which is probably one of the most poorly constructed endings in contemporary film history. It has a tacked on feel; it seems as if Zemeckis didn't want to upset his audience by ending his story with Marty not seeing the Doc again forever, so he made sure he had some way to bring the Doc back before the credits rolled. If this is the case, then the ending is even more unforgivable than it apparently is. Why? Though it doesn't seem to be pointed out very often these days, the ending is completely contradictory to a theme that was presented throughout most of the trilogy, that time travel is evil, that it should not have been invented, that it must be stopped, and all that philosophical talk about preventing further contamination of the time-space continuum. Ever since the first half of Part II, Doc Brown had been saying that the DeLorean should be destroyed, which he adamantly maintained until the machine was destroyed. Then what happens? Doc Brown comes back in a time machine made from a train! As cool as the train is (it's even better than the DeLorean), it just doesn't fit into the context. Also problematic is exactly how he created the train It was reasonable to believe he could retro-fit a DeLorean because Part I told us that the Brown family was wealthy. However, how could the Doc come in possession of a train, and quite a train, when he's only the town's blacksmith? And assuming he did get a train somehow, how did he find the means to modify it into what you see? Granted, he did have that DeLorean buried in a mine with which he could've gotten some inspiration, but he himself could not, in the eight months he had lived there prior to Marty's arrival, fix the machine, which draws skepticism on his ability to build another time machine from scratch WITH PARTS NON-EXISTENT IN THE OLD WEST THAT HE WOULD'VE HAD TO INVENT HIMSELF. He would've also had to have installed the hover mechanism on his own, since that business in 2015 would only convert old cars, so traveling to the future would not have helped him much to improve his train. Also, how was he able to get those special parts manufactured in the Old West? The final little problem is that before Doc leaves again, he says the machine is powered on steam, which doesn't sound like a joke. So if it's not a joke, then how on earth does Zemeckis and Gale expect us to believe that a time machine can actually be powered by steam, a fairly weak source of power? The two previous BTTF movies had plot problems mainly with time paradoxes, especially Part II, but they were both very entertaining to watch. Part III is just ho-hum. There's just one thing that's sad about this trilogy Unlike most franchises, this one was apparently conceived together as a trilogy, since various hints in Part I and Part II (especially II) indicated the story of this third film. (The ending of Part I also indicated what would happen in Part II.) That fact alone should've meant that all of the movies would've been approximately the same in quality, but this is not the case. Somehow, Zemeckis and Gale made up a story that just got worse and worse as it went along. And what's more Like LOTR and The Matrix trilogy, Part II and III were simultaneously shot, which further should've produced a minimal drop-off in quality as in the case of those other two trilogies (though maybe not Matrix 2 and 3, since we haven't seen those yet).

Also problematic is exactly how he created the train It was reasonable to believe he could retro-fit a DeLorean because Part I told us that the Brown family was wealthy. However, how could the Doc come in possession of a train, and quite a train, when he's only the town's blacksmith? And assuming he did get a train somehow, how did he find the means to modify it into what you see? Granted, he did have that DeLorean buried in a mine with which he could've gotten some inspiration, but he himself could not, in the eight months he had lived there prior to Marty's arrival, fix the machine, which draws skepticism on his ability to build another time machine from scratch WITH PARTS NON-EXISTENT IN THE OLD WEST THAT HE WOULD'VE HAD TO INVENT HIMSELF. He would've also had to have installed the hover mechanism on his own, since that business in 2015 would only convert old cars, so traveling to the future would not have helped him much to improve his train. Also, how was he able to get those special parts manufactured in the Old West? The final little problem is that before Doc leaves again, he says the machine is powered on steam, which doesn't sound like a joke. So if it's not a joke, then how on earth does Zemeckis and Gale expect us to believe that a time machine can actually be powered by steam, a fairly weak source of power? The two previous BTTF movies had plot problems mainly with time paradoxes, especially Part II, but they were both very entertaining to watch. Part III is just ho-hum. There's just one thing that's sad about this trilogy Unlike most franchises, this one was apparently conceived together as a trilogy, since various hints in Part I and Part II (especially II) indicated the story of this third film. (The ending of Part I also indicated what would happen in Part II.) That fact alone should've meant that all of the movies would've been approximately the same in quality, but this is not the case. Somehow, Zemeckis and Gale made up a story that just got worse and worse as it went along. And what's more Like LOTR and The Matrix trilogy, Part II and III were simultaneously shot, which further should've produced a minimal drop-off in quality as in the case of those other two trilogies (though maybe not Matrix 2 and 3, since we haven't seen those yet).

Not there are any, but just in case. Okay, now onto BTTFIII. I want to express my particular outrage at this movie. Yeah, you've all read it before; I don't hate BTTF movies, I love them, but this one just doesn't belong in the same league as the others. And having the standard set so high with the first two films is insignificant in this case This movie simply isn't very good. And this is where my outrage lies. This is a movie that tries to be science fiction, but it doesn't have enough sci-fi elements to justify being in the genre, apart from the time travel gags introduced in the previous two movies. This movie also tries to be a Western but is obviously so clichéd and routine that apparently this story was conceived on the parts of both Zemeckis and Gale to satiate some childish filmmakers' fancy to do a Western movie. I don't have evidence to support this, but that doesn't mean it hardly makes sense. Look at Zemeckis's career up to the present day. Notice the kinds of projects he takes, the styles he employs, and the techniques he likes to use. None of the above indicate he has any talent to create a fine, Western epic. Then you have the subtle Western homages, like the inclusion of Patt Buttram as Roger Ebert pointed out in his review, and Doc Brown's line in Part I that said he intended to visit his favorite period in time, the Old West, may in fact be sentiment of Zemeckis and\/or Gale. All I'm saying is that maybe Zemeckis wanted to do a Western someday, but knowing he didn't have the talent create a success from a pure Western, he decided to roll that idea into part of something more understandably crazy, a BTTF movie...Then maybe we'd all forgive him because he made a sci-fi film first and foremost, not a Western...Unfortunately, this particular story fits in very oddly with the rest of the trilogy. Ebert also stated how the other two were non-linear in their story telling, that all the time travel made for a story that flipped itself inside out while we all smiled at its eccentricity. (Part II was especially time travel madness heaven.) Apart from the scenes in the beginning of this film, which continues directly from Part II, the plot is extremely straightforward, with you classic action movie suspense devices with an Old West twist. Time travel is discussed as means of creating a purpose and direction for the plot, but no time traveling actually occurs after the beginning until final few minutes. BTTF's classic humor is ALL that saves this film from being unwatchable trash. And that brings me to another grievance The nauseating recycling of established BTTF gags. This was a serious problem with the second movie, where you could easily pick out which gags from Part I were adapted into Part II, and there were far too many instances of those. The problem even blemished Part I, as a few jokes from early in the movie were rehashed later on, which aroused a slightly uncomfortable sense of superfluous repetition. Now this is not necessarily a bad technique, as it can make fans of a film franchise feel at home with all of the in-jokes; it's also just plain amusing to see how story of one movie connects almost directly with another in the series through some small detail. Unfortunately, this technique is extremely difficult to do effectively, and sadly the BTTF movies generally fail with it. Moving on, this film has a much more emphasized love story. Whereas Part II had elements of romance but no real love story, and Part I had a love story that merely served as a fuel for many gags, plot twists, and heck, the entire story. Part I's love story obviously wasn't meant in any way to be heartwarming to romance fans out there. This is quite different in Part III, where tremendous care has been taken to make this offbeat romance at least the slightest bit touching by inserting in all those cutesy google-eyed exchanges, that overplayed kiss under the stars, and of course, the internal debate whether to do what is right according to the principles of science or to give into to needs of the heart. However, in this film, the romance isn't warm like the filmmakers' might've wanted it to be, it's just plain freaky, and I don't mean in the guilty-pleasure S&M kind of way; it's romance between an eccentric old scientist (one of the last men you'd expect in a Hollywood romance) and an equally eccentric woman (which becomes more and more apparent as the movie goes on For instance, **SPOILER** when the Doc tells Clara that he's from the future and he must return, instead of slapping or laughing at him thinking he's crazy, she gets upset because she thinks he has made up a Jules Verne-type fantasy to exploit her own imagination and break up with her with minimal heartbreak. Then, she stops the train on which she's leaving town just so she could run out and try to catch Brown before he's gone forever, and then she totally loses all semblance of sanity when she chases down and gets on the runaway train, recklessly risking her life just to catch up with Brown.), and that is HARDLY heartstring-tugging in my book. My biggest problem with this movie is its ending, which is probably one of the most poorly constructed endings in contemporary film history. It has a tacked on feel; it seems as if Zemeckis didn't want to upset his audience by ending his story with Marty not seeing the Doc again forever, so he made sure he had some way to bring the Doc back before the credits rolled. If this is the case, then the ending is even more unforgivable than it apparently is. Why? Though it doesn't seem to be pointed out very often these days, the ending is completely contradictory to a theme that was presented throughout most of the trilogy, that time travel is evil, that it should not have been invented, that it must be stopped, and all that philosophical talk about preventing further contamination of the time-space continuum. Ever since the first half of Part II, Doc Brown had been saying that the DeLorean should be destroyed, which he adamantly maintained until the machine was destroyed. Then what happens?

While the movie makes clear that some sort of policing force was necessary to try to establish at least a semblance of order in this completely chaotic and starvation-riddled country ruled by rival warlords, it also clearly questions the effectiveness of the U.S. forces, points out the tensions between the U.S forces and the Pakistani U.N. peacekeepers and demonstrates the uncalled for bravado of some of the American soldiers, who seemed to think this was going to be fun. In the end we see a horrific example of urban warfare as U.S. soldiers have to rescue the crew of a Black Hawk helicopter that was shot down. At the same time, one has to admire the commitment of the Americans to ensure that no one gets left behind - even those who were killed.The cast is clearly secondary to the story here. No one was going to win a best actor award because of that. Not that there weren't good performances, but in the end I really didn't think about the actors. The movie is a little slow starting (although in the first five or ten minutes there's a good introduction to the situation in Somalia) but once the action begins it is chilling. As I said, the violence is extremely graphic. This is not a movie to watch with your seven year old. But it is a very good movie.8\/10 ","genre":"Drama, History, War"},{"date":"23 January 2003","score":"","review":"  Based on the true story of the 1993 deployment of U.S. Forces in Somalia, supposedly to keep order, this film is an interesting and very graphic account of what happened in those months that led up to a total U.S. withdrawal from the region. While the movie makes clear that some sort of policing force was necessary to try to establish at least a semblance of order in this completely chaotic and starvation-riddled country ruled by rival warlords, it also clearly questions the effectiveness of the U.S. forces, points out the tensions between the U.S forces and the Pakistani U.N. peacekeepers and demonstrates the uncalled for bravado of some of the American soldiers, who seemed to think this was going to be fun. In the end we see a horrific example of urban warfare as U.S. soldiers have to rescue the crew of a Black Hawk helicopter that was shot down. At the same time, one has to admire the commitment of the Americans to ensure that no one gets left behind - even those who were killed.The cast is clearly secondary to the story here. No one was going to win a best actor award because of that. Not that there weren't good performances, but in the end I really didn't think about the actors.

Ford was always a solid actor but opposite the incredibly sexy Rita Hayworth the audience is forced to some degree to forget logic and common sense. Great use of shadows that you come to expect in this genre and they photographed Hayworth beautifully. How can you forget the first time Hayworth pops up with her beautiful red hair flowing? There are several great profile shots of her throughout the film. And that great shot of her leg pointed up! The script is entertaining although I do believe its a notch below Double Indemnity and Laura. The last half hour I thought was a little tiresome and the ending really surprises no one. I know others think this is one of the all time classics but I do not. I understand the mass appeal and it is a well made drama but like I said, its a notch below others in this genre. Also, Hayworth was pregnant during filming and in certain shots you can notice it. And her singing voice during the big number is dubbed. Good cinematography and shadowy characters make up for the shortcomings in the last part of the script. Fun film.
