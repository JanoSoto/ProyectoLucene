Finally deciding to stand up to him & his thugs Olivia decides to give evidence at his trial but O'Shea has her killed & takes his daughter Chelsea back, unhappy about this turn of events Kersey decides to revert back to his vigilante ways & take O'Shea & his mobsters out & get some revenge...Written & directed by Allan A. Goldstein this was the fifth & to date final film in the Death Wish series, while I haven't seen the original Death Wish (1974) or Death Wish II (1982) I have seen the the following three & of those Death Wish V The Face of Death is probably the worst on all fronts. The script here is pretty slow going, technically speaking Bronson doesn't kill anyone until at least an hour in which is just too long, the attempt at some moral message as seen in Death Wish 4 The Crackdown is absent & the sheer over the top exaggerated fun of Death Wish 3 is also missing so what we're left with is a passable if forgettable & somewhat dull thriller with a couple of action scenes & Bronson by which to call it a Death Wish flick. Death Wish V The Face of Death is maybe the only serious action film ever to feature a sadistic killer with a dandruff problem. The character's are alright, again anyone close to Bronson is killed or abused while the bad guy is rather dull & although we are told he's this mean mob boss we never see him do anything other than walk around & act tough. The plot twists & double crosses are very predictable & feel very familiar especially if you have seen the other previous Death Wish films. It's not totally terrible but is the weakest Death Wish film that I have seen & it just doesn't feel like a Death Wish film.For some reason the location of the Death Wish films keep alternating, the original Death Wish was set in New York, Death Wish II was set in Los Angeles, Death Wish 3 was again set in New York, Death Wish 4 The Crackdown returned to Los Angeles with Death Wish V The Face of Death set back in New York. The violence is pretty tame & even looks cut in a few places, someone set on fire, a few gunshot wounds & someones head is smashed into a mirror is about the sum of it.Although set in New York this was filmed in Ontario in Canada, & why not? Apparently Bronson was paid more than the entire budgeted film which isn't too hard to believe. This was Bronson's last theatrical film & it's not much of a swansong. The cast is alright & Michael parks turns in a good performance as the main bad guy.Death Wish V The Face of Death is average at best & not as good as the previous two entries, there's a lack of action, plot & a story that really does feel very familiar. A further sequel Death Wish 6 The New Vigilante was announced but never made.

I thought of aliens. No, I don't believe in extra terrestrials, but I had such an unusual feeling that if aliens were watching us when the attacks happened in this movie or in real life, what were they thinking? Oh, yeah &#x96; IDIOTS. How on Earth can such sophisticated beings plan on continuing when they can't seem to get any conflict resolved? I honestly don't want to sound un-American or un-Patriotic, but what a bunch of losers the human kind can be? For the first part of 'Soldiers' we are given the normal\/boring\/typical vision of 1960's United States before it sent young men into a never-ending conflict bend on making money for the rich. Then we plunge into a fierce battle of unprepared Americans for the remainder of the movie. Very graphic, I might add. So it does add a lot of the realism to WAR &#x96; or conflict. Unfortunately, it barely attempts an unbiased view of both sides fighting (notice a lot of sympathy on the American side, and somewhat, or little on the Vietnam side.) OK, I admit, I'm thoroughly ignorant on the whole war, especially this one battle, but someone had to get rich. Maybe more than one person. Again, let's focus on the outside influence that might be watching &#x96; perhaps, aliens &#x96; and see what they think of higher ups that plan on getting rich off of human beings being inhumanely slaughtered. Perhaps, I am bitter, anti-war, but seriously look at this enormously realistic view of a battle and tell me that it was all worth killing living, human beings for&#x85;oh I'm sorry, what again were they trying to accomplish and failed? Side note as much as I'm a Gibson\/Elliott fan, they seemed very bulletproof whenever they stood up.

Seriously, you're a general, or top-ranking military person, or President (and wife) and you have absolutely no problem telling someone to go and kill someone of the same species (and die trying) because it will make money for some fool in the long run? I have the deepest respect for those who put their lives on the line for normal civilians, but condemn the leaders who put them in that position. This movie made me think I was at Woodstock protesting (before my time) Make Love Not War.Question Am I supposed to praise this General played by Gibson?
