[{"date":"14 April 2015","score":"","review":" In the first few minutes of Election we are introduced to the main characters and basically what each of them thinks about their daily lives and their purpose in life. One particular scene highlights one of the teacher's lessons as he tries to squeeze out the students's idea of morals and ethics. Perhaps an early insight into Alexander Payne's screen writing style, Election will look to test these ideas and how humanity uses them in practice. The backdrop for this basis is a student body election that will determine the next student council president. The early candidate is the ambitious Tracy Flick (Witherspoon), who will stop at nothing to guarantee a bright future. In charge of the election is Mr. McAllister (Broderick), who resents Tracy for getting his colleague and friend fired due to an inappropriate relationship. Given his sour feelings, McAllister will persuade a popular jock named Paul Metzler (Klein) to run against Tracy in an attempt to get revenge for his friend. From then on, madness will ensue as McAllister experiences work and family problems and Tracy deals with the challenge of having competition.Election is, in essence, an exercise of how a human being acts in order to achieve what they rightfully believe is the common good. The dynamic of the movie is mostly supported in the head-to-head between Tracy and Mr. McAllister, but also with other characters. In the end, both of them end up being completely misguided in their actions. With that being said, it's the movie's ending that confuses me the most. I must warn you here that this final analysis of the movie may lead you to predict the conclusion of the referred film, and if so, you probably should stop reading here. Continuing with the review, by the movie's wrap up, it seems that, despite everything that happened, all our characters seem to have surpassed this simple school election, and are now living the lives they planned for themselves. Although it doesn't necessarily spell out if they're truly happy, it feels kind of weird that the message I get from this story is that if you do something wrong, you'll end up being fine, something that I don't entirely believe, after completing this movie. Give it a try, and see what kind of ideas you get from it.Rating 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 April 2015","score":"","review":" In the first few minutes of Election we are introduced to the main characters and basically what each of them thinks about their daily lives and their purpose in life.

But he wasn't trying to just make a fighting game, he decided to use the characters and ideas of the game as the components of sci-fi action thriller, which he invented. Steven is also a director, this film is his second director's work, after a long break on screen writing career.In the film there is a big semantic implication and teachings, in the form of dialogs and remarks between the characters. The picture is filled with deep meaning, but it does not become tedious or boring, on the contrary everything is very appropriate. The film is very spectacular, excellent stunt work and work of the artists and special effects creators.Despite PG-13 rating, the film does not seem quite childish, it has a lot of violence and murder, ever-present tension. For example, the movie begins with news from the hot spot and displaying of General Bison breaks the necks of the captive soldiers. The director came up with the fictional country Shadaloo in which General Bison is trying to seize power, while on his secret base, equipped with modern equipment and weapons, serve him a lot of fighters and scientists. His ultimate goal is to have the whole world. General wants to create an army of super soldiers, mutants. He takes as a donor of one of the captured soldier named Carlos Blanca - Charly, it is one of the interesting changes of the director, in the game mutant was another man, but his name is also Blanca, in the game Charlie is the name of the soldier who was killed Bison, and for whose death now wants revenge him on another soldier named Guile, Charlie's friend. Also for example, the girl-fighter Chun Li in the film is the leading reporter, reporting from Shadaloo, boxer Balrog is the cameraman, and sumo fighter Honda a television director, they both leave a career and now work in television together with Chun Li. A excellent interpretation.Street fighters, main characters of the original game Ken Masters and Ryu, now deal with different kinds of fraud, they arrive in Shadaloo to crank out another thing, but to cheat Sagat and his men they have not come out. Sagat decides to use them as gladiators. But during the first bout of Ryu with champion Vega, the building bursts Colonel Guile on the self-propelled gun, and arrest everyone. Now Guile wants with the help of Ken, Ryu and Sagat to find the lair of Bison and rescue the hostages. Parallel to this, Chun Li and her friends prepare his plan of salvation. This is very well thought out story. Like in the game, Ryu helps Ken, to make the right decisions.It should also be said that Steven was able to skillfully use the elements of fighting in the story with gun shooting, explosions and chases. In the film there are all super attacks and the habits of the characters, and the actors are strikingly similar. Best turned out Vega - very quick and plastic fighter in the mask and with a glove with blades, which brilliantly played the Jay Tavare, the character literally stepped off the screen of the arcade machine. The same can be said about Zangief, naive strong man, who, being a kind man, foolishly went to serve for Bison.Guile is well played by Jean-Claude Van Damme, in the film he has a short haircut, which in principle is right, because he's military. From Major, he became a Colonel, he perfectly fulfilled all the incredible techniques of this character from the game. But personally I very liked Damian Chapa in the role of Ken, he gave the character a more natural image, a kind of merry rascal. Well, and actually, this actor always liked me. General Bison is great played Raul Julia, this is perhaps his best role, the last role unfortunately, the actor died two months after the completion of filming, the film is dedicated to his memory. As always at Steven De Souza, a very competent humor, really funny in many scenes and dialogs. The film does not become too comedic. All perfectly balanced. He also wrote the title song and exciting radio-remarks. Great Graham Revell music, perfectly emphasizes the atmosphere and morale of the film. Especially managed opening theme, and the theme of sending of the AN(Allied Nations) soldiers.A movie that may many teach the younger generation, an example to follow. The perfect combination of action, sci-fi, fighting and humor. A great example of how to make movies based on video games. 10 out of 10.I strongly disagree with critics who threw slop this wonderful film. Guys, I think you do not understand what you want. Probably you wanted make the characters look cartoon and silly, like in the game. In any case, this is not a criticism, it's just your stupid taste. Need to be a very bad person to scold this film.

Both Cage and Connery are well-suited for their roles and their quirks and charisma hold the cheesy plot together. Not that I have anything against cheesy.

They're all distinct enough and memorable enough that you'll care what happens to them and you'll be pleasantly shocked when some of them do something unexpected. There are plenty of twists to keep you interested and the whole story does not have a lull moment in it, as it should be.That being said, the story as a whole is a bit clichéd, even by 90s standards, and while some of the twists are surprising, the main story arc is rather predictable.

And in this movie, he certainly made me laugh. Back To School is one of Rodney Dangerfield's best movies, it's a simply hilarious motion picture that contains a big amount of laughs in it. Basically, seeing Rodney Dangerfield enrolling in college is just a recipe for disaster. And during the course of this film, he experiences triumphs and tragedies, as well as delivering to the audience a big amount of big laughs. Considering what a fan of Dangerfield that I am, I decided to give this movie a viewing, and I was not disappointed at all by what I watched. Throughout the course of this movie, I laughed, and I laughed hard. Along with Caddyshack and Easy Money, this movie ranks as one of Rodney Dangerfield's best efforts. Dangerfield was a genius in more ways than one, he was great not just on stage, but in movies as well, and whenever he appeared on screen, he stole the show.Dangerfield steals the spotlight in his hilarious performance as Thornton Melon, a businessman who decides to help his son in college by enrolling as a student himself. Sally Kellerman gives a good performance as one of Melon's professors, to whom Melon takes a liking. Burt Young is very funny as Lou, Melon's friend, bodyguard, and partner in crime (if you could call him that). And, Paxton Whitehead is very effective as Dr. Phillip Barbay, an economics professor that serves as an antagonist to Melon. Naturally, Dangerfield stole the show in his role, every single minute that he was on screen shined like gold, he put the 'L' back in laughs. But hey, that is usually expected in just about any movie that he appears in, and in this movie, that definitely applies to him.How many hilarious scenes does this movie contain? There are too many to list. Among them include the scene near the beginning featuring Melon's Tall And Fat Brand, then there is Melon's first economics class in which he keeps interrupting it, not to mention the scene where he donates the building. Then there's a scene featuring Sam Kinison as a professor who goes absolutely nuts while teaching his class. All in all, if you are a fan of Dangerfield, then the chances of you enjoying this movie are very high, as it contains a very big amount of laughs. So sit back and join Rodney Dangerfield on a trip to school that you will never forget, that is his 1986 marvel, Back To School.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 April 2015","score":"","review":" To help his discouraged son get through college, a funloving and obnoxious rich businessman decides to enter the school as a student himself.In case I haven't mentioned already, Rodney Dangerfield is one of my favorite comedians, he is always capable of making me laugh.

And, Paxton Whitehead is very effective as Dr. Phillip Barbay, an economics professor that serves as an antagonist to Melon. Naturally, Dangerfield stole the show in his role, every single minute that he was on screen shined like gold, he put the 'L' back in laughs. But hey, that is usually expected in just about any movie that he appears in, and in this movie, that definitely applies to him.How many hilarious scenes does this movie contain? There are too many to list. Among them include the scene near the beginning featuring Melon's Tall And Fat Brand, then there is Melon's first economics class in which he keeps interrupting it, not to mention the scene where he donates the building. Then there's a scene featuring Sam Kinison as a professor who goes absolutely nuts while teaching his class. All in all, if you are a fan of Dangerfield, then the chances of you enjoying this movie are very high, as it contains a very big amount of laughs. So sit back and join Rodney Dangerfield on a trip to school that you will never forget, that is his 1986 marvel, Back To School.9\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Romance, Sport"},{"date":"14 April 2015","score":"","review":" To help his discouraged son get through college, a funloving and obnoxious rich businessman decides to enter the school as a student himself.In case I haven't mentioned already, Rodney Dangerfield is one of my favorite comedians, he is always capable of making me laugh. And in this movie, he certainly made me laugh. Back To School is one of Rodney Dangerfield's best movies, it's a simply hilarious motion picture that contains a big amount of laughs in it. Basically, seeing Rodney Dangerfield enrolling in college is just a recipe for disaster. And during the course of this film, he experiences triumphs and tragedies, as well as delivering to the audience a big amount of big laughs. Considering what a fan of Dangerfield that I am, I decided to give this movie a viewing, and I was not disappointed at all by what I watched. Throughout the course of this movie, I laughed, and I laughed hard. Along with Caddyshack and Easy Money, this movie ranks as one of Rodney Dangerfield's best efforts. Dangerfield was a genius in more ways than one, he was great not just on stage, but in movies as well, and whenever he appeared on screen, he stole the show.Dangerfield steals the spotlight in his hilarious performance as Thornton Melon, a businessman who decides to help his son in college by enrolling as a student himself. Sally Kellerman gives a good performance as one of Melon's professors, to whom Melon takes a liking.

We had to watch a number of movies from all genres and periods. Many of these viewings were instructional only and frankly there was little entertainment value. This movie is not in that category. This is probably the best western I've seen from a purely objective viewpoint. That said, I feel this movie preaches the Southern cause from an indirect angle in order to influence our feelings about the modern world in light of that outcome. The unjust Union, nefarious Union outlaws, and a total disregard deflection from anything slavery being a factor in the civil war is designed to give you a revisionist lobotomy and make you feel good about it. I found myself enjoying the storyline and hackneyed plot that flows more like a backwater slough than a free flowing stream simply because it wasn't entirely predictable and had a mix of endearing ne'er do wells with many quirks and comedic relief moments. While stories of this sort are certainly true and even one's absurd to the point of illucidness are fairly frequent in biopics such as Ang Lee's Ride with The Devil, this story is all to high on the South with no swing of the pendulum. This is because of the bias of the author.I was able to get inside this movie because sadly my great grandfather was a confederate sympathizer along with Forest Carter. My grandfather and Forest Carter saw some kind of glory in the lost cause and wished it to continue. After further research I found that Forest Carter definitely had racist sympathies. He also fabricated The Education of Little Tree which was written as a true story. This effort tells the story in such a way that it would seem all the Southerners in Missou are good and all the Jayhawkers are bad when in fact there were atrocities on both sides. Enjoy the ride but read the history yourself. I guess one admirable quality about the film is that it does play the devil's advocate the pitches the truth as being from the confederate side which is almost always maligned and certainly not every person on that side was evil incarnate. The danger is the selling of ideology and undercurrent influence. ","genre":null},{"date":"14 April 2015","score":"","review":" This movie was required viewing for a college drama class.

The tremendous script and chemistry between Woody Allen and Diane Keaton make this film an instant classic. The wooden performances of the best friend (Michael Murphy), the schoolgirl (Mariel Hemingway) and Allen's ex-wife (Meryl Streep) can be ignored and allow the viewer to be charmed and annoyed in equal measure by Isaac Davis (Woody Allen), as he bumbles through life from attempting to run over his ex-wife's lesbian partner to quitting his job as a TV writer to focus on his book.Diane Keaton as Mary Wilkie is the biggest try hard character one could find and only Allen could write this cynical yet delicate part. She floats through with references to religion and Carl Jung, and attempts to camouflage her mental instability and inability to accept life drifting from meaningless relationship to meaningless relationship.

Captain Meissner (John Amos) is his hardnosed guard. Guard Braden is more by the book. Dallas (Tom Sizemore) is an overly helpful prisoner. Eclipse manages the motorpool. Prison strongman Chink Weber is gunning for Frank.The setup is questionable. I don't get how a guy who escaped once could possibly be slated for release. The only way is to do a deal with the D.A. probably as a whistleblower against Drumgoole. The short exchange in the movie seems to suggest that and then the question becomes how does Drumgoole still have a job? The explanation for Frank's situation is so short that it feels like the movie would rather ignore it.The movie is trying to be gritty but parts of it seems wrong. At times, this feels more like a Rocky movie. There's even a musical montage of them fixing up a hot rod. It's completely out of place. There are other moments like teaching First Base how to drive. Again it's trying to be heart warming which is ill-fitting for the premise. Some of it works better but there are too many situations that don't match the expected tense grittiness. The dialog is also wrong. First Base actually uses the word 'jive'. The movie has a few too many clunky things going on.

To those who can only appreciate special effects and movies with lack of plots, stay away from this film. The movie is undoubtedly hard to watch, but it's a powerful, character-driven movie about unforeseen consequences of a tragedy. The film is powerfully acted by underrated actors like Tom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek. It is movies like these that make me appreciate the art of cinema and storytelling. Todd Field's film is about a college freshman home for the summer who is dating a soon-to-be-divorced mother many years his senior. This relationship causes a rift between his mother and father, especially after a serious tragedy occurs affecting their lives forever. The film has a good cast of underrated and underused actors and I feel like they all did a good job in particular Tom Wilkinson and Sissy Spacek. Spacek shows an emotional side to herself, which is perfectly normal as any mother would show. Wilkinson however keeps a calm reserve state of mind, but the end of the movie is his show. Nick Stahl also did a decent job, and likewise for Marisa Tomei. Overall, In the Bedroom is a slow-moving, but very effective movie that relies upon its characters more than anything else. The film is emotional, but sometimes the film shows different takes on getting to that state of mind. An incredibly strong script as well as fantastic acting makes this film a worthy watch. But beware of the tepid pace, as only serious film-goers may appreciate this kind of pace.

Somehow, the entire family manages to get on the plane without Kevin, who somehow ends up on a plane to New York. We then follow Kevin checking into New York's most expensive hotel and actually being reunited with the the bungling hoods (Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern) who tormented him in the first film.If you can accept the fact that the McCallisters would allow that plane to Paris to take off without a head count and you can accept the fact that the Plaza Hotel would allow a child to check in by himself and don't question him being in possession of so much cash and credit, and you can accept the fact that these two idiot thieves actually somehow put together enough money to afford a trip to New York so that they can rob FAO Schwartz, there is fun to be had here.Director Chris Columbus and screenwriter John Hughes have mounted a viable sequel that is served well by its cast. Macaulay Culkin is just as slick and funny as he was in the first film. It doesn't hurt that the screenplay paints Kevin as the smartest character in the movie. There are some funny turns by Rob Schneider as a bellman, Dana Ivey as a snooty desk clerk, Eddie Bracken as the manager at FAO Schwartz and especially Tim Curry as the Concierge, who is onto Kevin and spends the entire running time trying to prove that the child is at the hotel alone and that his parents are not on the way. A bouquet as well to Catherine O'Hara, who is just wonderful here as Kate McCallister, whose overwhelming guilt about leaving her son behind again has her tearing the island of Manhattan apart looking for her son.If you liked the first movie, liking this one will not be a stretch.

Macaulay Culkin is just as slick and funny as he was in the first film. It doesn't hurt that the screenplay paints Kevin as the smartest character in the movie.
