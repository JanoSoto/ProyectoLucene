Most disappointing.If you've played the games, this movie is worth a view even if just for the nostalgia trip and because many of the scenes actually feel like they are right out of the games (whether this is a good or bad thing I'm not sure ;).

This would have been a great theme for a movie on itself (remember Das Boot). But apparently the director was afraid it wouldn't be enough, he had to make it a little more spectacular. He wants us to believe that the Americans sent out one of their own submarines to recover an enigma-machine from a German U-boat who broke down in the middle of the ocean and who had to wait for another U-boat to arrive with spare parts... Why they added this? I really don't know, but in my opinion it doesn't do any good to the movie. If you've seen Das Boot and if you are a great fan, like me, you'll probably notice that several of U-571's scenes resemble to the scenes from Das Boot. I'm not saying they copied it, but from time to time I really had a feeling of Been there, seen that... The same for the acting. It wasn't bad, but wasn't brilliant either. You can see that they watched Das Boot several times before starting to act themselves. This means that you sometimes will have the feeling that you already know the characters, that you've met them before... I would say the actors did a good job, without excelling. They helped me to forget about the bad story ... from time to time.All in all U-571 isn't a good movie. You'll find it well worth seeing when you haven't seen Das Boot before and when you don't know anything about World War II. They should have asked advice to the director of Das Boot. He certainly knew how to give you the feeling that you were into that boat, being attacked by the enemy, alone with the crew and no-one to come to the rescue. I really missed that in U-571. To me, this movie isn't worth much more than a 5\/10.

However, it is fairly accurate; the film is exactly like every other movie Van Damme has done. The lame one-liners, the cliché dialog, the stereotype characters, the decent-at-best action... I was honestly barely paying attention to this film, partly because I had seen it before, once, and couldn't remember if it was good or not(believe me, had I remembered it, I never would have watched it), but mainly because every time I did pay attention I almost instantly wound up mocking and laughing at what went on on-screen. It's just so typical and by-the-numbers that it's ridiculous. Every single action scene involved stuff that we've seen before(and more than enough of), every line of dialog tried to be clever but wound up being embarrassing, each of the cool villains were just too damn stereotypical and the whole thing was so preposterous and predictable that it was laughable rather than anything else. The plot is predictable and poorly paced. It's about... uh, Van Damme #1 gets killed, Van Damme #2 finds out #1 existed, some tame unrealistic fighting ensues, Van Damme breaks bones with the ease that only he and Steven Seagal can manage... eh, something else happens... like I said, I wasn't really paying very much attention to it. The one good thing I can say about this, and a lot of people will probably crucify me for saying this, but I have to say it; Natasha Henstridge looks hot as hell in this film, and if you are ever forced to watch this for whatever reason, or you find yourself being half bored by the film, stay awake for the sole reason of seeing her getting her freak on... the one bad thing about is that Damme is there too, but that is tolerable to see Natasha like that.

It holds up well for today's times too, and is probably best appreciated by young people who are coming of age, rather than those of us who've already been there.As I've said, I found it difficult to relate to these silly teenagers even from when I was a kid. Believe me, I wasn't exactly what you'd call a model teen all of the time myself ... I did some irresponsible things too ... but I was always my own person and never felt the need to fit in with the crowd. So it's hard for me to feel sorry for a dopey girl who goes around with the class bully and switches jerks like she changes socks; dumb boys who get into knife fights and are stupid enough to risk their lives playing chicken or get drunk or run around brandishing guns just because they've had a non-traditional childhood (I myself was a child of divorce and never needed a bottle or a pistol). Plenty of times I felt like yelling to the screen, serves ya right! But the thing is -- considering the real types of kids portrayed here, the movie does capture their turmoil perfectly.

I saw Aguirre Wrath of God at the cinema a few years ago and decided I never wanted to see it on the small screen, but haven't foreseen a chance to see Fitzcarraldo so, so I submitted to seeing it on DVD. I watched it twice that day! Like Aguirre, it's visually a beautiful film, which makes far better use of the landscape than similar white man goes nuts in the Jungle movies. It's also far less patronising than Mosquito Coast and nothing like as pretentious as Apocalypse Now. Herzog can escape the tired jungle as Id cliché (one which he himself may have set the template for in Aguirre) because his and Fitzcarraldo's real dreamscape is opera. It also has a far more honest approach to the jungle than those movies. Rather than setting it up as a primeval Conradian hell (a comparison which the interviewer sets up but Herzog seems to ignore in the DVD commentary) in which the basest instincts of man are unleashed, it is a strange but beautiful world which offers potential for banal business exploitation. The natives are not the virtual extraterrestrials of old but simply another social organisation with different values and ways of comprehending the World. Unlike Kurtz, it is not the Jungle that defeats Fitzcarraldo but the rather more modest natives who simply and innocently exploit Fitzcarraldo even as he is selfishly exploiting them.At 230, it probably is too long for such a simple story but this probably has more to do with a very leisurely first act, establishing Fitzcarraldo's love of opera, the time and society of the rubber barons and Fitzcarraldo's touching relationship with his Madame wife. It takes Fitzcarraldo an hour to actually set out up the river. And anyway, is that really such a harsh criticism in a world that can tolerate 315 hours of the trite Titanic and over 9 hours of the overblown Lord of the Rings. The film is packed with detail and incident but Herzog needs to present this as a slow painstaking endeavour. But cutting it down to 100 minutes (Herzog's usual running time, he's not known for making long films) would have diminished the difficulty of Fitzcarraldo's enterprise. The viewer needs to share at least some of that effort.There's not much to choose between the English soundtrack and the German, though admittedly some of Kinski's line readings sound a little more stilled in English (mainly in a couple of admittedly redundant exposition scenes), but then the lip movements match better as the film was shot in English.

I watched it twice that day! Like Aguirre, it's visually a beautiful film, which makes far better use of the landscape than similar white man goes nuts in the Jungle movies. It's also far less patronising than Mosquito Coast and nothing like as pretentious as Apocalypse Now. Herzog can escape the tired jungle as Id cliché (one which he himself may have set the template for in Aguirre) because his and Fitzcarraldo's real dreamscape is opera. It also has a far more honest approach to the jungle than those movies. Rather than setting it up as a primeval Conradian hell (a comparison which the interviewer sets up but Herzog seems to ignore in the DVD commentary) in which the basest instincts of man are unleashed, it is a strange but beautiful world which offers potential for banal business exploitation. The natives are not the virtual extraterrestrials of old but simply another social organisation with different values and ways of comprehending the World. Unlike Kurtz, it is not the Jungle that defeats Fitzcarraldo but the rather more modest natives who simply and innocently exploit Fitzcarraldo even as he is selfishly exploiting them.At 230, it probably is too long for such a simple story but this probably has more to do with a very leisurely first act, establishing Fitzcarraldo's love of opera, the time and society of the rubber barons and Fitzcarraldo's touching relationship with his Madame wife. It takes Fitzcarraldo an hour to actually set out up the river. And anyway, is that really such a harsh criticism in a world that can tolerate 315 hours of the trite Titanic and over 9 hours of the overblown Lord of the Rings. The film is packed with detail and incident but Herzog needs to present this as a slow painstaking endeavour. But cutting it down to 100 minutes (Herzog's usual running time, he's not known for making long films) would have diminished the difficulty of Fitzcarraldo's enterprise. The viewer needs to share at least some of that effort.There's not much to choose between the English soundtrack and the German, though admittedly some of Kinski's line readings sound a little more stilled in English (mainly in a couple of admittedly redundant exposition scenes), but then the lip movements match better as the film was shot in English.

As I sat in utter disbelief coming to the realization that they truly liked this movie, they sat in equal utter disbelief coming to the realization that I thought it was pure trash. Now, I saw this movie 1 and 1\/2 times and they saw it more than me, so their defense was more profound than my critique, but nonetheless it made me take a step back and re-review it. I saw it when it came out, but these were the first people I had met in 2 years who didn't think this movie was awful. And this wasn't based on region, class, age, or any demographic worth noting. Everybody I discussed this movie with thought it was completely ridiculous. Until now. So let me throw in my 2 cents to compare and discuss among others.To understand why I hate this movie, I have to bring up others. Boyz N Tha Hood and Menace II Society had characters in it that were actually likable, and even though they did things that some considered immoral, it wouldn't be immoral in their different set of rules. For example, Kane and Tre, did things and reacted in ways to situations based on their life and the rules in the hood. Doughboy and Wax may have been thugs and criminals, but they didn't do things in excess of rules put in place. None of them started pointless fights or disrespected others for no reason, and all of them tried to do right by the rules. So, if you have a character in a movie who is supposed to be like, he by definition has to be likable. Doughboy, Kane, Tre, Wax and even the murder happy O-Dogg were likable in the context of the hood. Conversely characters like the racist cop and the dude that dropped a dime on Kane and O-Dogg (after Kane beat him like that boxin on TV) were unlikeable and rightfully so. Adding this in, 2Pac's character in Poetic Justice also falls along these lines. Now take Baby Boy. I couldn't stand any character other than Ving Rhames and the mother. Ving was an ex con trying to do right and Tyrese tried him one too many times and got hemmed up and later decked. And the mother had one (and formerly another) bum of a son who refused to grow up and she tried to educate him and his girl until finally she had enough and rightfully kicked him out. But Tyrese as the main character had zero redeeming qualities. He ran his mouth way too much and was a worthless father and boyfriend. Plus, he used the memory of his dead brother to guilt his mother into takin care of him. Kane and Tre were trying to grow up and even if they had childish backward views on certain issues, they were trying. Tyrese wasn't. His girlfriend was even worse. She knew he cheated on her and still stayed with him. She let Snoop barge in her house without any concern for her child. My coworkers said I judged her without knowing her background. Look, all I had to go off of was her chickenhead behavior in the movie. Like Tyrese, she ran her mouth too much and was loud and was the cause for her own troubles. And as the two main characters you were supposed to connect with them, I didn't - not because I couldn't forgive them for their flaws, but because they didn't do anything to deserve it. Every bad thing that happened to them, they facilitated it and wanted us to feel sorry for them. The only reason these two worthless idiots are together is because neither one of em could handle Snoop. Please. Gimme a break. We may all know people like them or have friends like them and while we wouldn't bad mouth them, at some point we have to stop making excuses and call a spade a spade, or in this case, an idiot an idiot.So this moves me to the secondary characters. They were all idiots and exaggerated stereotypes that ALWAYS took the low ride. Omar Gooding was hilarious as the over hard friend. And that girl from Tyrese's girls work was awful. Again, I am aware that there are people like this, but NOT 24-7. These characters RARELY did anything right. They were all unlikeable as people in general. This is unrealistic. And every scene was exaggerated to the extreme. When Tyrese's girl was talking to her friend and her man came up behind her and started hittin it? Again, I'm not sayin it's totally unrealistic, but it's a bit much. At no point in this film did I connect with these characters in a good way. I saw friends and family playing these roles, but they were the friends and family I made fun of or disliked.Overall, this movie was crap, made even worse with scenes like Omar Gooding acting all hard, and the ridiculous womb scene. I laughed AT this movie as opposed to WITH it and although my coworkers made me rethink my stance, I just couldn't bring myself to change it.

Able to view it as an original piece of work without any other spin, I found it to be a rather charming little film &#150; slight and lacking real bite but still providing gentle laughs and subtle comment. The plot allows for the film to look at the way that homosexuality has changed over the decades to the point now where it is acceptable and yet still looked down upon (but not openly in public &#150; that is not PC!). It also manages to bring in other threads involving Felix's homophobia, a thread that starts out being very funny but later becomes quite touching and delicate.

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"10 September 2004","score":"37 out of 46 people found the following review useful","review":"  In recent years we have seen a number of Hollywood remakes of classic British crime films, such as 'Get Carter', 'The Italian Job' and, most recently, 'The Ladykillers', a phenomenon that has aroused some critical comment, especially in Britain. This film shows that, nearly thirty years ago, this same phenomenon was happening in reverse, and the British were remaking classic American crime movies. The plot broadly follows that of the 1946 film, with the striking exception that the action takes place in London rather than Los Angeles. This does not, however, mean that the original has been completely anglicised. Both Philip Marlowe and General Sternwood are American expatriates living in London rather than Englishmen, and they are played by two of Hollywood's biggest stars, Robert Mitchum and James Stewart. With the exception of Richard Boone as Canino and Candy Clark as Sternwood's younger daughter, the other main parts are all played by British actors. The film was clearly made as homage to the famous Humphrey Bogart classic, and it is inevitable that comparisons will be made between the two. In some respects, in fact, the later film is superior to, or at least as good as, the earlier one. (I have not read Raymond Chandler's novel, so I cannot say which film is closer to the original source material). The 1946 film is a fine one, but it is not perfect and has a number of weaknesses, not least its insanely complicated plot containing threads that are never developed and events that are never explained. The plot of the 1978 film, while complex enough, is somewhat easier to follow than that of its predecessor. To the purist Bogart fan there can be no substitute for the original, but to anyone else Robert Mitchum, himself a fine exponent of the film noir style during the early part of his career in the forties and fifties, seems like the best possible replacement. He is, of course, older than Bogart was when he played the role, and his portrayal of the character is perhaps less cynical and more thoughtful, but it is a perfectly acceptable interpretation. There are also good performances from Stewart in the cameo role of Sternwood, from Oliver Reed and from Joan Collins.As a whole, however, the film does not live up to the standard of the original. Certainly, not all the actors are as good as their 1946 counterparts (Sarah Miles, for example, is no Lauren Bacall), but the main reason for its comparative failure goes deeper. The Bogart movie is perhaps the quintessential film noir, a film that one watches less for its plot, or even for its acting, than for its unique atmosphere of cynicism, menace and dubious glamour. An important factor in creating that atmosphere is its dark, brooding black-and-white photography. Unfortunately, in the late seventies the use of black-and-white was generally regarded as the equivalent of hanging a sign on the cinema door saying 'Warning! Art-house Movie! Intellectuals Only!' A few established auteur directors such as Woody Allen ('Manhattan') and Martin Scorsese ('Raging Bull') could get away with using monochrome, but there was no way that the studio would allow such latitude to Michael Winner, a director generally associated with violent commercial thrillers. So colour it had to be. In fact, the photography of London and the English countryside is quite attractive, but it is no substitute for the authentic film noir look. I mentioned that the atmosphere of the earlier film was also one of dubious glamour; besides Bacall it has a large number of other strikingly beautiful but sinister women (some of them only in minor roles). The later film cannot compete in this respect. With the exception of Joan Collins (who could do sultry but sinister glamour in spades, even in her mid-forties), none of the female characters has the required touch of the femme fatale about her.As a London-based crime thriller, Winner's 'The Big Sleep' is not a bad film; it is better than most of its director's other thrillers and better than a lot of other British films from the seventies. As homage to its namesake, however, it falls some way short of its aims. 6\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"10 September 2004","score":"37 out of 46 people found the following review useful","review":"  In recent years we have seen a number of Hollywood remakes of classic British crime films, such as 'Get Carter', 'The Italian Job' and, most recently, 'The Ladykillers', a phenomenon that has aroused some critical comment, especially in Britain.

The film was clearly made as homage to the famous Humphrey Bogart classic, and it is inevitable that comparisons will be made between the two. In some respects, in fact, the later film is superior to, or at least as good as, the earlier one. (I have not read Raymond Chandler's novel, so I cannot say which film is closer to the original source material). The 1946 film is a fine one, but it is not perfect and has a number of weaknesses, not least its insanely complicated plot containing threads that are never developed and events that are never explained. The plot of the 1978 film, while complex enough, is somewhat easier to follow than that of its predecessor. To the purist Bogart fan there can be no substitute for the original, but to anyone else Robert Mitchum, himself a fine exponent of the film noir style during the early part of his career in the forties and fifties, seems like the best possible replacement. He is, of course, older than Bogart was when he played the role, and his portrayal of the character is perhaps less cynical and more thoughtful, but it is a perfectly acceptable interpretation. There are also good performances from Stewart in the cameo role of Sternwood, from Oliver Reed and from Joan Collins.As a whole, however, the film does not live up to the standard of the original. Certainly, not all the actors are as good as their 1946 counterparts (Sarah Miles, for example, is no Lauren Bacall), but the main reason for its comparative failure goes deeper. The Bogart movie is perhaps the quintessential film noir, a film that one watches less for its plot, or even for its acting, than for its unique atmosphere of cynicism, menace and dubious glamour. An important factor in creating that atmosphere is its dark, brooding black-and-white photography. Unfortunately, in the late seventies the use of black-and-white was generally regarded as the equivalent of hanging a sign on the cinema door saying 'Warning! Art-house Movie! Intellectuals Only!' A few established auteur directors such as Woody Allen ('Manhattan') and Martin Scorsese ('Raging Bull') could get away with using monochrome, but there was no way that the studio would allow such latitude to Michael Winner, a director generally associated with violent commercial thrillers. So colour it had to be. In fact, the photography of London and the English countryside is quite attractive, but it is no substitute for the authentic film noir look. I mentioned that the atmosphere of the earlier film was also one of dubious glamour; besides Bacall it has a large number of other strikingly beautiful but sinister women (some of them only in minor roles). The later film cannot compete in this respect. With the exception of Joan Collins (who could do sultry but sinister glamour in spades, even in her mid-forties), none of the female characters has the required touch of the femme fatale about her.As a London-based crime thriller, Winner's 'The Big Sleep' is not a bad film; it is better than most of its director's other thrillers and better than a lot of other British films from the seventies.

This film shows that, nearly thirty years ago, this same phenomenon was happening in reverse, and the British were remaking classic American crime movies. The plot broadly follows that of the 1946 film, with the striking exception that the action takes place in London rather than Los Angeles. This does not, however, mean that the original has been completely anglicised.

It is often said that his recent offerings do not come up to the standard of his great films of the seventies and eighties. In my opinion that is, to some extent, true. I have not seen any truly great Allen film, measured by the standards of 'Annie Hall' or 'Manhattan', since 'Hannah and Her Sisters' in 1986 and 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' three years later. Nevertheless, he has made a number of very good ones. Most filmmakers would be delighted to count among their oeuvre just one film as good as 'Manhattan Murder Mystery', 'Bullets Over Broadway', 'Mighty Aphrodite' or 'Sweet and Lowdown'; the fact that Allen can lay claim to all of those suggests that it is premature to write him off as a spent force. One criticism that could fairly be made of Allen is that he has a limited range as an actor, although he can be very good within that range. His normal screen persona is that of the neurotic, intellectual Bohemian middle-class New Yorker, but in 'Small Time Crooks' he is clearly trying to extend his scope. He, unusually, casts himself as a working-class character, Ray Winkler, an unsuccessful New Jersey petty criminal. (Despite this, he still looks and sounds much the same as he does in his other films). Ray's latest scheme is to rob a bank by tunnelling into it from the shop next door. To divert suspicion, he persuades his wife Frenchie to bake cookies and to sell them from the shop. Thanks to Ray's incompetence, the bank robbery does not come off, but Frenchie's cookie business proves a surprise success, and within a year the Winklers find themselves the millionaire bosses of a prosperous bakery enterprise. The film then moves into the realms of social satire. Frenchie, like many another nouveau-riche, longs to be accepted into New York high society, but her vulgar and ostentatious displays of wealth quickly make her a laughing-stock among the old-money elite. (Allen clearly has no time for the theory that America is a classless society without the social distinctions that mark the Old World). In a variation on the 'My Fair Lady' story, Frenchie befriends David, an upper-class English art-dealer, and persuades him to try and teach her about art, literature, fine wines and social etiquette so that she can pass herself off as a cultured person of taste and breeding. Ray, on the other hand, has no time for culture. Rather than visit art galleries and expensive restaurants, he would prefer to live the life of a couch potato, watching television and eating cheeseburgers. Despite the success of the cookie business, he still frets for his earlier, simpler life as a criminal. Forgetting that he was a totally incompetent one, he dreams of pulling off one last spectacular heist. Unlike some, I did not think that Allen was trying to preach or moralise in this film. There is certainly no suggestion that those of working-class origins should stick to cheeseburgers and televised sport rather than interest themselves in culture. The only thing wrong with Frenchie's programme of self-education is that (unlike, say, the Julie Walters character in 'Educating Rita') she is doing it for the wrong reasons, out of snobbery rather than out of genuine interest. There is, perhaps, the implication that many of the more established members of New York society are just as shallow as Frenchie; they are merely better at hiding their shallowness behind a veneer of sophistication. If there is a moral, it is perhaps that small time crooks like Ray and his gang (portrayed as endearingly inept) are less dangerous than big time white-collar crooks like the accountants who defraud Ray and Frenchie of their wealth, or even David, who might not break any laws but who turns out to be as grasping and materialistic as any criminal. The two main sources of humour in the film are Frenchie's social pretensions (she loves to use long words, but only those beginning with A, as she has not yet got round to reading the rest of the dictionary) and the bumbling incompetence of Ray and his gang. (The bank raid, for example, misfires because Ray misreads the map and ends up tunnelling into a dress shop rather than into the bank). Allen's performance in this film is a fairly restrained one; he is outshone by Tracey Ullman, who gives a delightfully over-the-top performance as the loud and vulgar Frenchie, the sort of nouveau-riche who has been the butt of satire ever since Moliere's 'bourgeois gentilhomme', or even Trimalchio in Petronius's 'Satyricon'. Hugh Grant is an actor with as limited a range as Allen, but like Allen he can excel within that range, and he is excellent here as David, the suave but hypocritical upper-class English gentleman.

Frenchie, like many another nouveau-riche, longs to be accepted into New York high society, but her vulgar and ostentatious displays of wealth quickly make her a laughing-stock among the old-money elite. (Allen clearly has no time for the theory that America is a classless society without the social distinctions that mark the Old World). In a variation on the 'My Fair Lady' story, Frenchie befriends David, an upper-class English art-dealer, and persuades him to try and teach her about art, literature, fine wines and social etiquette so that she can pass herself off as a cultured person of taste and breeding. Ray, on the other hand, has no time for culture. Rather than visit art galleries and expensive restaurants, he would prefer to live the life of a couch potato, watching television and eating cheeseburgers. Despite the success of the cookie business, he still frets for his earlier, simpler life as a criminal. Forgetting that he was a totally incompetent one, he dreams of pulling off one last spectacular heist. Unlike some, I did not think that Allen was trying to preach or moralise in this film. There is certainly no suggestion that those of working-class origins should stick to cheeseburgers and televised sport rather than interest themselves in culture. The only thing wrong with Frenchie's programme of self-education is that (unlike, say, the Julie Walters character in 'Educating Rita') she is doing it for the wrong reasons, out of snobbery rather than out of genuine interest. There is, perhaps, the implication that many of the more established members of New York society are just as shallow as Frenchie; they are merely better at hiding their shallowness behind a veneer of sophistication. If there is a moral, it is perhaps that small time crooks like Ray and his gang (portrayed as endearingly inept) are less dangerous than big time white-collar crooks like the accountants who defraud Ray and Frenchie of their wealth, or even David, who might not break any laws but who turns out to be as grasping and materialistic as any criminal. The two main sources of humour in the film are Frenchie's social pretensions (she loves to use long words, but only those beginning with A, as she has not yet got round to reading the rest of the dictionary) and the bumbling incompetence of Ray and his gang. (The bank raid, for example, misfires because Ray misreads the map and ends up tunnelling into a dress shop rather than into the bank). Allen's performance in this film is a fairly restrained one; he is outshone by Tracey Ullman, who gives a delightfully over-the-top performance as the loud and vulgar Frenchie, the sort of nouveau-riche who has been the butt of satire ever since Moliere's 'bourgeois gentilhomme', or even Trimalchio in Petronius's 'Satyricon'. Hugh Grant is an actor with as limited a range as Allen, but like Allen he can excel within that range, and he is excellent here as David, the suave but hypocritical upper-class English gentleman. The film as a whole is not, perhaps, first-class vintage Allen, but it is still entertaining, and even non-vintage Woody Allen is better than most recent film comedies. 7\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Crime"},{"date":"10 September 2004","score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Watching this movie was, for someone such as me, who had fallen in love with Delhi and NSD(National School of Drama, New Delhi), almost simultaneously (no, I was not a student there; I just went to watch their plays) more than a decade ago, a journey down memory lane. And not just me! Many of my friends, who spent a considerable time in Delhi at some or other point of their life, agreed with me on this point. In the words of one of my friends,Monsoon Wedding is a documentary about Delhi.. For me, it was thrilling to view the places near Jama Masjid, where once I spent many afternoons at my friend's home, (and surely, nor far from where Dubey's residence would be!) after so many years. But then what can I do? We are like that only.This movie has some of the best Indian actors, such as Naseeruddin Shah, Khulbhushan Kharbanda and Rajat Kapoor in it. But the guy who beats all of them and steals the show is our Dubeyji, Vijay Raaz. I had noticed him first in the movie Jungle, where his portrayal of an almost silent (had he taken Omerta, by any chance?) bandit-gang member was excellent; but in Monsoon Wedding, his portrayal of Dubeyji beat all these first-rate actors. I've been a great fan of Naseeruddin Shah for quarter of a century now; but in this movie, my vote goes to Raaz.The most striking feature of this movie is Mira Nair's ultimate attention to detail. (I think this is also a major factor that adds such authenticity to the character of Dubey!). From the Hindu ritualistic red-thread worn by Shah on his wrist (it must be put for the movie, Shah being a Muslim in real life, or was it that his real-life Hindu wife made him wear that!), to the pair of shorts worn by Raaz, Nair & Co. has painstakingly paid enough amount of attention to details. A Dubey would surely dress, talk and carry himself the way depicted in this movie. His choice of profanities are the most authentic that one would hear on the streets of Delhi. Alice and Ria also put very powerful performances!This movie took me back to Delhi, and to the corridors of the Univ. I (and Nair, much before I, for that matter!) once walked on. Anyone who loves, or plans to fall in love with, Delhi should watch this movie, because as Mauz once said, Who would go away, Mauz, leaving the labyrinths of Delhi behind? (Kaun jaye, Mauz, Dilli ki galiyan chhod kar?).Notes The following is in response to some of the comments by Western reviewers.1) Just because he addresses his nephew as idiot, the bride's father is not mean and abusive; this is just a term of endearment. I guess, this is just a matter of cultural difference; things that are accepted in the Orient may be completely offensive in the Occident, and vice versa. This reminds me of the autobiographical note by the Egyptian born Nobel laureate, Prof. Ahmed Zewail, whose (toally accepted and used in the Arab world) figure of speech I will kill you terrified a classmate at Caltech (or was it Berkeley?).2) Some people thought that the two guys sharing a bed (when the young girl offers a kind of striptease show to the Australian guy) was a hint at homosexuality; it was not! I don't mean that homosexuality does not exist in India; but it's quite common in India for people to share a bed when there's a shortage of beds (especially when a number of relatives and guests come down for, say, a wedding, to stay overnight, and then mostly younger members of the family are pushed to share beds.). Note Robert de Niro and Hervey Keital slept on the same bed in Mean Streets, but they were not gay either!3) Would the maid and the wedding planner be allowed to dance with the upper-class family? My Answer is I think, yes! Most of the Punjabi weddings include Whiskey\/alcohol in the menu (at least, for the important guests), and once you have alcohol in your veins, Universal Brotherhood (Bhai-chara in Hindi) prevails.
