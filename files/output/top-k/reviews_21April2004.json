The editing is rather poor, with several sequences sloppily put together that are saved only by the music and the enthusiasm of the performers in the scene.

It is unclear whether the numerous continuity errors and glimpses of the crew in the frame are actual mistakes or intentional in-jokes.Another major flaw is the perplexingly downbeat finale.  In the play, Frank-N-Furter and Columbia's death is funny, because Frank doesn't believe that Riff Raff will really do it, and Columbia makes a poor decision to step in front of Frank to block him.  When Riff Raff unceremoniously kills them and they drop dead simultaneously, it's shocking, but funny.  In the movie, the scene is played so straight that it becomes depressing and kind of ruins the fun of the movie.I also prefer this movie without the song Super Heroes for much the same reason.

I recommend that you see this movie without the audience participation part before going to a theater at Midnight to see it.
