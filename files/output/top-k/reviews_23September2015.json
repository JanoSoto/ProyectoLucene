If you don't already know what this movie is about then you really need to stop reading this right now and go watch the movie. I've seen this movie dozens of times over the years from VHS to DVD to Blu- ray and I've seen it at least five times on the big screen and for my money this is Alfredy Hitchcock's greatest film and one of the greatest ever made. I know VERTIGO, a brilliant movie, gets all the love and respect but for my money this here is his greatest film.Where do you start with a movie like this? Everyone knows that the budget was slashed on the director and it certainly helped the film because had this been in color or had it been lavished with a big budget then it just wouldn't have the same feel. The movie has some of the most historic moments in film history that everyone knows about. These moments are of course the shower sequence as well as the ending. Both certainly deserve to be mentioned whenever you discuss brilliant scenes but for my money the greatest sequence in the movie is what happens before the shower sequence and it's the discussion between Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) as they discuss what is basically holding them back.The performances between the two actors are just so flawless and this scene is so important because it tells us everything we need to know going into the second half of the movie, which is pretty much after the shower scene. The first portion of the movie we're worried and caring about the Crane character but we get the shock of what happens and then our sympathy immediately turns to Norman and him helping his mother. The way Hitchcock pulls this off is rather remarkable but the shocks keep happening with one terrific twist after another leading up to the ending.What's always amazed me about this movie is how your initial viewing is nothing but pure shocks and gasps but then on repeat viewings, even when you know all the secrets, you can enjoy it just as much because you can then enjoy the film by watching a master handle the material. You can watch for the clues and see all the winks that Hitchcock is giving the viewer. No matter how many times I watch this film I can simply sit back and enjoy it on so many levels. It's a movie where you brain knows what's going on but the film is just so great that you can enjoy everything and wish that the character's fate changes somehow.Everything from the performances to the score to the cinematography are flawless. This is without question one of the most impressive movies ever made. It's certainly a ground-breaking picture that has its legendary director at the top of his game. PSYCHO has been copied countless times over the past fifty-five years but nothing has come close to its impact.

But he broke the mold when he made The Thing, and the result is probably the greatest monster movie in history. Sure Jaws was great, and so was Alien, but The Thing blows them all away. It's about a twelve-man research team that unwittingly takes in an alien organism that has been frozen in the ice for over 100,000 years. As if things couldn't be worse, this alien can shape-shift and absorbs its victims, so no one in the camp quite knows who is real and who is the thing. Rob Bottin's special effects for the film are probably its ground-breaking achievement, for it was the first movie with a really gross-looking monster, and the monster effects still look great even today. Ennio Morricone's chilling score, Dean Cundey's beautiful photography, and John Llyod's incredible sets all help contribute to the eerie mood of the picture. Not only that, but the cast does a great job, and as far as I'm concerned, Carpenter was at the peak of his skills when he made this film.

It never strays beyond the realms of believability, and is an altogether well constructed film.Samuel L. Jackson is incredible as Elijah Pryce, a man with brittle bones who struggles to find his purpose in life. Through only two or three scenes, Shyamalan and Jackson create a character we can know intimately. It becomes very clear that certain moments in Elijah's life have drastically altered his personality. For a man with one of the most commanding presences in Hollywood history, Jackson plays Elijah with shades of hysteria, patheticness and crushed self-esteem.The same can't be said for Willis, who really sleepwalks throughout the movie. Only in two scenes does Willis actually mine his talent pool to produce anything special. It really sets the movie back when watching Jackson and Robin Wright (also excellent) act their hearts out only for Willis to soberly nod in reply. Spencer Treat Clark was adequate, but after Haley Joel Osment's career-making turn in the previous Shyamafilm, Clark couldn't fill those shoes.Shyamalan's direction is the film's greatest asset. Long takes, highlights on colour, and some incredible cinematography in the film's climactic scene are just some highlights. During one of the opening scenes, while Dunn is in the hospital and a doctor checks him over, a bleeding on the nearby patient oozes slowly and then quickly throughout to highlight the drama of the scene. In addition to some thrilling scenes, there's at least one dramatic scene involving a showdown in the Dunn family kitchen that was superbly written, directed and constructed.The twist ending was a bit disappointing to me. I felt it was far less subtle than its predecessor and it doesn't change the whole film experience but at the same time I found it believable and very much in keeping with the foreshadowing and superhero theme. The reveal then cuts to white text explanation, which was probably the worst part, as the film ends not with a bang but a whimper.Samuel L. Jackson's powerful performance and M.

So goes the song that opens this comedy horror hit set in a small California town where the teen population is made up by 50% living and 50% Undead. Dianne Wiest is returning to her hometown with her children to live with her father (Bernard Hughes), a crotchety grouch who keeps a supply of his special soda which is off limits to his grand kids, and forgets to reveal certain secrets of the town to his returning child. The oldest son, disillusioned by having to have left his old home, manages to make new friends, but unfortunately they are the wrong kind of friends.Shortly before the family was seen driving up the California coast into the town, an amusement park was invaded by the teen night creatures who prayed down on a couple making out in their car, turning them into a late night snack. Wiest plays her typical happy-go-lucky single mom, and finds romance by getting a job at the local video store, finding romance with her boss, eligible bachelor Edward Herrmann. She's disturbed by the presence of the strange teenagers who come in, and the caustic conversation that occurs between them and Herman. The younger son gets mixed up with a bunch of strange kids whom we later find out are on the search for evidence of how they can destroy these midnight teen creatures.The violence increases, the blood flows, and yes if you haven't figured it out already, these lost boys (and girls) are vampires. That even includes a little boy, turned into a night creature desperate for nutrition for the human plasma. The idiotic teenage vampire hunters begin to suspect that Hermann might be the head vampire, and when a plot to expose him involving garlic doesn't work, it seems like they are on the wrong track. But is it too late for the older son? He seems to be turning into one of them, and if choosing the wrong crowd can get him turning into a creature of the night, then he doesn't have a chance of avoiding the stake.Sleep all day! Party all night! That is the promise that the older son's new friends give him, and all it will take is one last drink of the red liquid to complete their mission. But with evidence creeping in on this rough teenage crowd, it seems like the mirror of their souls will not be reflected as time runs out. This is horror comedy at its best, certainly not quite as gruesome as the scary movie films but definitely much better. There are lots of surprises along the way, and then there's a musical opus that is almost classic as a film reaches its dramatic and violence conclusion. Veteran actor Bernard Hughes gets a great tag-line, being sort of the Sylvia Sidney (Mars Attacks) hero to save the day, although he doesn't use bad music like Slim Whitman to do so.One of the great top popcorn films of the late 1980s, this was the film that established Dianne Wiest as one of my favorite actresses. She had started off in mostly supporting neurotic parts, and with The Lost Boys, she began playing kindly moms confused by their children, and here, started the trend. After this along came Parenthood, Cookie, and my favorite of her parts on screen, the Avon lady mom in Edward Scissorhands. There is some stupid comedy with the two vampire hunting teens, as they seem more like pals of Sean Penn's from  Fast Times at Ridgemont High, but perhaps their characters influenced the creation of Buffy, the vampire slayer. It is a must for horror movie fans, and more than 25 years later, it seems like something just so fresh, almost like it came out yesterday.

The younger son gets mixed up with a bunch of strange kids whom we later find out are on the search for evidence of how they can destroy these midnight teen creatures.The violence increases, the blood flows, and yes if you haven't figured it out already, these lost boys (and girls) are vampires. That even includes a little boy, turned into a night creature desperate for nutrition for the human plasma. The idiotic teenage vampire hunters begin to suspect that Hermann might be the head vampire, and when a plot to expose him involving garlic doesn't work, it seems like they are on the wrong track. But is it too late for the older son? He seems to be turning into one of them, and if choosing the wrong crowd can get him turning into a creature of the night, then he doesn't have a chance of avoiding the stake.Sleep all day! Party all night! That is the promise that the older son's new friends give him, and all it will take is one last drink of the red liquid to complete their mission. But with evidence creeping in on this rough teenage crowd, it seems like the mirror of their souls will not be reflected as time runs out. This is horror comedy at its best, certainly not quite as gruesome as the scary movie films but definitely much better. There are lots of surprises along the way, and then there's a musical opus that is almost classic as a film reaches its dramatic and violence conclusion. Veteran actor Bernard Hughes gets a great tag-line, being sort of the Sylvia Sidney (Mars Attacks) hero to save the day, although he doesn't use bad music like Slim Whitman to do so.One of the great top popcorn films of the late 1980s, this was the film that established Dianne Wiest as one of my favorite actresses. She had started off in mostly supporting neurotic parts, and with The Lost Boys, she began playing kindly moms confused by their children, and here, started the trend. After this along came Parenthood, Cookie, and my favorite of her parts on screen, the Avon lady mom in Edward Scissorhands. There is some stupid comedy with the two vampire hunting teens, as they seem more like pals of Sean Penn's from  Fast Times at Ridgemont High, but perhaps their characters influenced the creation of Buffy, the vampire slayer. It is a must for horror movie fans, and more than 25 years later, it seems like something just so fresh, almost like it came out yesterday.

It was the beginning to a super successful new franchise. the X-Men movies. Writer and director Bryan Singer was mostly known for his Academy Award winning work on The Usual Suspects. And it was definitely quite a leap from the world of crime into the world of superheroes, or I should maybe say mutants with superpowers. The cast may appear to include some big names, but that's only because of what happened in the last 15 years. There is certainly some irony to the fact that only Anna Paquin, the youngest cast member, was an Academy Award winner back in 2000. Berry had her win not much later. Famke Janssen looks absolutely stunning in here and was mostly known for her portrayal of the very memorable Xenia Onatopp at this point. James Marsden was fairly unknown and same can be said about Hugh Jackman, an Australian actor that nobody knew before this film was made, but who since has risen up into the elite of Hollywood. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen were both very established actors already, even if McKellen did not yet have the LotR-trilogy under his belt. And finally Rebecca Romijn, who received lots of recognition and awards for her portrayal here, which baffles me as I felt her character was 99% makeup and special effects than a really convincing performance, even if she played a memorable character. Oh year and Bruce Davison is in here as well, a Golden Globe winner and Oscar nominee.So yeah, the story here is that the world of humans is also full with mutants and there are obviously skepticisms coming from both towards the other. Mutants are also separated into two groups, the ones who aim at piece with humans and the ones who look forward to war. Anna Paquin plays a young mutant who is a key figure in the evil mutants' plans, but the main character Wolverine is still portrayed by Hugh Jackman and I think it was a bold movie by Bryan Songer, who also wrote the characters, to have Jackman carry this franchise on his shoulders, at least in this first film. Quite a vote of trust. I assume Singer was already planning a second film when he made this one here. He included an ending, where it was left open if Jackman may return depending on how audiences would like him and also an ending, in which McKellen could very well return as the main antagonist, even if he was not 100% evil, just disappointed and desperate I guess. I expected a final fight between Stewart's and McKellen's character as they really built up that storyline, but Stewart was pretty much missing-in-action for the entire final fight sequence and the young guns took responsibility. Still, they reunited the two for the very final scene, which again shows that McKellen's character is not 100% evil playing chess with his mentor and antagonist. The two just have completely different political positions.This was a good film in terms of special effects and characters, they were all fairly memorable and easy to distinguish with their costumes and abilities, which is always important in sci-fi films. It was unusually short for a superhero movie, only 95 minutes without credits and completely different compared to today's standards. I must say this one got me curious about the next installments to the series and I will certainly check these out at some point. As for this very first, I recommend it. Good watch.

These two made Metropolis a couple years earlier and you cannot think of a better transition from silent film to sound film than Metropolis to M. But it is not just them. Peter Lorre is absolutely outstanding in here. He did not have as much screen time as I remembered from previews viewing of these almost 110 minutes, but when he is on screen, he absolutely nails it, even more impressive as this was basically his first bigger role and he wasn't even 30 yet.This is about a city's hunt for a child killer, played by Lorre. The first third is about the situation unfolding. The second third of the film is mostly about the hunt for Lorre in an office building and the last third is about what justice determines in this particular case. I thought the first and the last third of the movie were the best. In-between there are some lengths and this film could have been kept at around 90 minutes in my opinion with cutting out some of the less important scenes. One weakness was maybe that I found it sometimes different to see if we deal with police right now or with the gangsters trying to catch the killer as well. Yes they did. First of all, they were annoyed with all the police presence because of Lorre's character on the loose and secondly they did not want to be categorized the same like a child murderer, even if some of them were murderers as well as we find out in the last scene.That last scene was an absolute highlight, especially thanks to Lorre's portrayal of guilt while being a victim himself due to the voices in his head. As good as it gets for a 1930s movie. And there is also a great lesson on moral included in here. All in all, I give this film a thumbs-up. It's a good watch from start to finish and even has a great moment occasionally. Definitely a good watch and I wonder which other great films Lang may have come up with if his work in Germany had not suffered from the Nazi's rise to power 2 years after this film came out. But he left us quite a few strong works nonetheless. This is certainly one of them. Recommend it.

However, Aladdin is clever, funny, has amazing themes, a beautiful soundtrack, and is a very satisfying movie.The film is set in place resembling the Middle East. Aladdin is a young boy who lives in the streets. Princess Jasmine (his future love interest), lives in the castle and is heavily restricted by her father. Princess Jasmine leaves the castle one day and meets Aladdin. The two have an immediate bond! As the story develops, they fall in love. The evil secretary Jafar, tricks Aladdin into going to retrieve a magical lamp for him. Aladdin rubs the lamp and sparks a friendship with the genie (Robin Williams). Because princesses are only allowed to marry princes, his first wish is to become a prince. The two begin to fall in love. Jafar steals the lamp and becomes very powerful. Aladdin tricks him in to becoming a genie and he is sucked into a lamp. Seeing that Jasmine and Aladdin are in love, the king changes the law and allows them to get married. The storytelling and pacing in the movie is amazing. This movie is an adaptation of the Arabian Nights story. There have been many fairy tale adaptations such as Frozen, Tangled, and The Princess and the Frog. Because of when Aladdin was made, the only thing it lacks are the high definition qualities. However, the complex story leads away from lack of production!Moreover, the movie took some very interesting risks that turned out amazing. Normally for Disney movies, the protagonist is obviously good guy. He does everything right, and is a model citizen. This is not the case for Aladdin, who if you pay attention, is actually a criminal. He is a common thief, but despite this, Disney is able to make us root for him. He is a very relatable character and uses his wishes to help him find love. The movie also does an amazing job portraying Jasmine. Instead of making her a ditsy princess and a very minor character, they dig deeper. She isn't just Aladdin's to be won, she falls in love with him too. In the movie, she recognizes him immediately as the boy she met in the streets. It is revealed that she loves Aladdin for who he is and does not care if he is a prince or a petty thief. We also get a very developed character in Genie, who provides the comic relief in the movie. The film is never able to hit a dry spot because he constantly makes us laugh. The decision to get Robin Williams to voice the genie was a smart one, as his charm seeps through the character.The underlying theme from the movie seems to be to just be yourself.

This is universally seen as one of the best movie soundtracks of all time.Overall, Aladdin was an amazing movie and one of Disney's best in my opinion.

He is a very relatable character and uses his wishes to help him find love. The movie also does an amazing job portraying Jasmine. Instead of making her a ditsy princess and a very minor character, they dig deeper. She isn't just Aladdin's to be won, she falls in love with him too. In the movie, she recognizes him immediately as the boy she met in the streets. It is revealed that she loves Aladdin for who he is and does not care if he is a prince or a petty thief. We also get a very developed character in Genie, who provides the comic relief in the movie. The film is never able to hit a dry spot because he constantly makes us laugh. The decision to get Robin Williams to voice the genie was a smart one, as his charm seeps through the character.The underlying theme from the movie seems to be to just be yourself. Instead of going the easy route and having Aladdin become a prince, Disney decided to have him stay the same. Children needed to see that being themselves was always the right answer.As if the characters and story weren't enough, Aladdin had an astounding soundtrack. As of today, I still find myself singing A Whole New world. This song was truly incredible and won a Grammy for Song of The Year. This is universally seen as one of the best movie soundtracks of all time.Overall, Aladdin was an amazing movie and one of Disney's best in my opinion. If you have not seen it, I would greatly recommend it! You will find yourself thinking about it weeks later and be happy you did!

The acting was good, the cinematography outstanding and the story compelling. The scenes of Bligh at the Admiralty were excellent and well-timed. However, there were some missing elements that would have enhanced the effectiveness of the scenes and the movie as-a-whole.Most of what I consider to be critical-yet-absent stuff is character development What is Bligh's past, and why was he so adamant on challenging the roaring forties at Cape Horn? How did Mr. Christian become an officer in the Royal Navy and then, quickly, lose all sense-of-duty or even interest in sailing after a Polynesian girl gives him the eye?Other un-adressed equations are Just how dangerous was it for a ship to challenge Cape Horn? Could they have done it some other time-of-year? Was Bligh's intended revisit to the Cape the sole reason for the crew's mutiny?One scene I found most unconvincing was the scene where Bligh barks out orders to clean and maintain the ship. This would have been de rigeur on any vessel at the time. Crews clean and maintain and test endlessly, and the scenes of the crew demoralized and unhappy about having to clean are laughable.The music by Vangelis did not help the scenes, nor add to their effectiveness. I will never know just how dangerous the mission around the horn would have been for the Bounty, because it is never explained Just a few more lines of dialogue would have been adequate.If I fill in the holes, I see a lieutenant obsessed with making a mark that will earn him the rank of captain. We see a crew that has found paradise and doesn't want to leave. We see a fair first mate who is somewhat sympathetic to the crewmembers. The Bounty needed to introduce us to Bligh, the man, his history, his psychology. We needed to have-described the history of Cape Horn, in regards to previous, attempted navigation and passage of sailing vessels.
