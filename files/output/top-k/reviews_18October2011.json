One has to give credit for an interesting gimmick. And there's little doubt that the gimmick was necessary - because without the electric shocks there wouldn't have been anyone screaming at this very un-scary horror movie.Vincent Price (star of 50's horror movies galore) stars as pathologist Dr. Warren Chapin. Chapin - in addition to the routine autopsies he does as part of his job - has been researching fear, and especially whether a person can be literally scared to death. His particular interest is that tingly feeling we get along our spine when we're frightened. His research reveals something shocking - that tingly feeling is actually caused by a rather large earwig type of creature that our fear creates! True! At least in the context of this movie. That's basically it, unless you count the fact that Price also takes an acid trip in the movie to induce hallucinations that he hopes will scare him, because he's been unable to scare himself. (Also true!) And he had the good fortune to run into a couple who run a silent movie theatre - and she's a deaf mute, and so can't scream, which is quite inconvenient, because apparently screaming (letting our fear out) is the only thing that actually kills The Tingler (which is what Price names the rather ridiculous looking quasi-earwig.)Vincent Price has never really been my cup of tea. He's not a bad actor, I suppose, but why he became such a legend is a bit beyond me, except I guess because he just kept getting cast over and over again in this kind of movie, and so gained that reputation as the classic horror star of the 50's. If you think you'd like a Vincent Price movie that I would describe as quirky rather than scary, then this one might well be for you!
