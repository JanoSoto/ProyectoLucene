This film has a lot in common with the other grim futuristic science fiction film especially in terms of deadeningly slow pace given life by a choice cast and some of the most visionary and creative production design seen up to the time.Films are only as interesting as their antagonists, and Lynch's DUNE does an excellent job setting those up. The Harkonnens are wonderfully nasty and amoral beings living in a cold and sterile industrial hell- planet with smoke stacks, cables, and cubicles as far as the eye can see. The Imperial planet is austere in a Victorian sense and the Spacing Guild presented in such a ghastly and grotesquely inhuman fashion that they're as interesting as they are stomach-churning. All three of these villainous factions give the film the life that it has. Unfortunately, the good guys are quite one-dimensional and dull in comparison. Kyle McLachlan doesn't really get to do much with his part, other than slowly become more obsessive, powerful, and unlikable as the film progresses. Ms. Young gets to do even less and maybe has 3 or 4 lines. You know you're in trouble when a narrator has to tell us, Paul and Chani's love grew because the film gives us no other indication of this. I believe that's where the film fails, is in giving any depth to its main characters or any believability or humanity to their character arcs. This may have been the result of numerous cuts made to the film based on an already quite abridged script. A lot of the narrative failings fall on the shoulders of director Lynch however, as he is so unable to show what is going on that he relies on characters' inner monologues to tell us what is going on, and much of the time quite unnecessarily.Despite its great failings and bizarre combination of confusion and slowness, DUNE has well-realized otherworldly atmosphere aided immeasurably by the costuming department who went all-out in creating a visual style for the film that has never been equaled since. It's a truly unique mixture of styles and various steam-punk \/ H.R. Geiger influence on display. Historically, this film represents a major crossroads of some of the best special effects people working at the time, with makeup artist Giannetto De Rossi, mechanical effectsman Carlo Rambaldi, explosive engineer Kit West, and miniature set guru Emilio Ruiz all combining forces for the only time in all of cinema. The results are a mixed bag for sure, but on the occasions in which this film works, it's utterly amazing.

Site B is where the dinosaurs fully matured before being shipped onto the site of the first Jurassic Park and in the four years since, they have been roaming free without human supervision. Despite Ian's reluctance, he realises he has no choice when he learns that his girlfriend Sarah (Julianne Moore) is already there as part of a team to observe the animals along with video technician Nick Van Owen (Vince Vaughn) and field equipment specialist Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff). Immediately setting off to launch a rescue mission, Malcolm and his team soon discover that they are not alone - a second team arrives at Site B led by InGen CEO Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) and game hunter Roland Tembo (Pete Postlethwaite) with the aim of capturing enough dinosaurs to fill a Jurassic Park in the heart of San Diego...The Lost World Jurassic Park takes no time at all getting into its raison d'etre as we see dinosaurs in the film's prologue and not long after they first get to the island. And it all goes downhill from there on - the problem the first film had was that despite the wonderful set-up, it resorted to being a straight-up 'run away from the monster' movie and this makes no improvement on that. Instead of being more imaginative, it introduces elements we'll all too familiar with like the rival team or the stowaway daughter (Vanessa Lee Chester) whose sole job in the movie is to get into trouble.

The script is just as disappointing as before, the actors are mostly fodder for the dinosaurs to eat and the effects lack that initial punch they had before, despite maintaining their high standards from before. It didn't take me long to realise why the first film is still held in high regard but neither this or Jurassic Park 3 are discussed with equal reverence. It feels like exactly what it is - a bombastic sequel that is more interested in box-office takings and less interested in entertaining its audience. My advice is to stick with the first film which at least offers a grander scale and a better cast. Or, if you haven't seen any of the Jurassic Park film, try waiting for the forthcoming Jurassic World.

Often, the latter kind are the better movies, because they understand that the power of a story is in the journey the characters take, not the destination, and a noble loss can resonate as much or more than a hard-fought win. But if the movie has done right by the journey, then the outcome really might as well go either way. As Mr. Miyagi reminds Daniel, it does not matter whether he wins or loses. This is not just lip-service, because by the time Daniel takes to the mat for his final match, he has already gotten to the point where he should be.Sports movies are often heavy-handed with their metaphors and messages, and Karate Kid is no exception. A certain amount of obviousness is perhaps inherent in the genre, since sports are celebrations of the most obvious elements of human existence muscles, bones, sweat, blood. And yet, sports movies tell us, there is a meaning to these things without which they are impotent. Bad guys in sports movies are the ones who don't see anything beneath the surface. They are almost always bigger, stronger, and faster than the good guys. But the good guys know that the real competition in sports is internal, a mastery of mind or spirit, and an acquisition of wisdom about how to use one's power. Karate, with its overtones of Oriental mysticism, is even more suited to this kind of message than baseball or boxing or running, though for decades movies have been making it work for each of these sports and more. Mickey is an effective teacher in Rocky, but Mr. Miyagi is spot-on in Karate Kid. He has all the great lines, on-the-nose as they are. You remember lesson about balance? he asks Daniel. Yeah. Lesson not just karate only. Lesson for whole life.Pidgin English notwithstanding, the Miyagi character has a rich (and strikingly politicized) backstory, and Noriyuki Pat Morita makes him feel like a real person. It surely helps that Morita is of Japanese descent. He sounds right and moves right, as anyone who knows Japan can tell. A Chinese or Korean actor playing a Japanese sensei would be acting, but Morita can't for a moment be caught pretending. Interestingly, his costar Ralph Macchio is also playing an immigrant of sorts&#x97;a poor Italian kid from Jersey transplanted to blonde, suburban California.

I say loosely because the majority of the film is the work of film director Todd Browning and bears little resemblance to Stoker's literary masterpiece. Don't be fooled, though, because the film is just as powerful and as engaging as Stoker's original story.Bela Lugosi won the role of the Count (again) after Universal's first choice, Lon Chaney, passed away prematurely from throat cancer. So, in this respect, the passing of a silent horror star made way for the birth of a new, talking horror star. Lugosi electrified movie audiences with his eerie portrayal of a man hungry for blood. The film begins as Renfield (Dwight Frye) makes his way to the Count's mountaintop abode in Transylvania. He is meeting the mysterious Hungarian aristocrat in order to finalize the lease on a dilapidated structure called Carfax Abbey, which is situated in London, England, and which the Count has recently purchased. Not long after meeting Dracula, Renfield is rendered insane and is committed to Doctor Seward's (Herbert Bunston) psychiatric asylum located just steps away from Dracula's recent acquisition, Carfax Abbey.ow that Count Dracula and Renfield are both ensconced in London, England, all havoc breaks loose &#x97; from innocent flower girls dropping dead in the streets to performances of the Royal Ballet's Swan Lake being infiltrated by an evil Hungarian bloodsucker on the prowl. Soon, the women in this film are dropping like flies. First, the love-struck Lucy (Frances Dade) is brought down, and then her best friend &#x97; and Jonathan Harker's (David Manners) fiancée &#x97; Mina (Helen Chandler) is pursued. Clearly, Dracula has an insatiable appetite for women of the meek and blonde variety.Thankfully Mina's demise is stalled by the ever-alert Abraham Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan), who clashes with Dracula from the very start. Van Helsing is an expert on mysterious ailments and mythical creatures of the night. He identifies the Count as the girls' assailant almost immediately. Van Helsing's will is strong and he is able to battle Dracula better than anybody else. It is truly a battle of brains and brawn between these two formidable characters, and watching them go head to head is a real treat! As we previously mentioned, Van Sloan and Lugosi had worked together before on the 1927 stage version of Dracula, and their on screen chemistry is just fantastic.Lugosi is an absolute delight to watch &#x97; well, aside from the fact that he can't seem to stop preying upon defenceless young women. Simply speaking, Lugosi was born to play the role of Count Dracula. Even if you have never seen this film before and are unfamiliar with Lugosi, his image is still the first one you picture when someone mentions the ubiquitous Transylvanian count. He was handsome, rather than grotesque, and that is one of the biggest reasons why his variation of the Count was considered so dangerous. He embodies Count Dracula from the top of his head through to his long claw-like hands, down to his expertly shined shoes. His long cape flutters behind him, almost dancing along as he hunts down innocent females to feed upon.If you are new to this film, one of the first things you will notice is that there is no musical soundtrack. Some may view that as a negative, but upon closer inspection, the silence that ensues in the most frightening scenes actually adds to the story's intense atmosphere. Together with the lack of mood music, the cinematography and camera-work in Dracula are quite impressive, considering the film's age and how new this medium still was back in the early 1930s. The close-ups of the Count are chill inducing and the images that were captured on film really stay with you for hours and even days afterwards! It will be a long while before I sleep with my window open ever again; that is for sure.The set design and decoration is typical of most 1930s era films (heavily influenced by the Art Deco movement), especially the scenes set in Carfax Abbey. Just one glimpse of that humongous twisting stone staircase sets my heart on fire! Though Count Dracula is a wealthy aristocrat, his living spaces are primitive and decrepit and they beautifully illustrate his very nature as a monster. On the other end of the spectrum, Doctor Seward's living and working quarters are very robust and welcoming, warm and inviting, ostentatious yet practical for a man who studies medicine and psychiatry.Dracula has left an indelible mark on movie audiences since its premiere in 1931. It is widely considered a cult horror classic unrivalled by many of today's modern horror fare. Mention it to anyone who has seen it before and their eyes will inevitably light up as they begin offering you tales of the first time they sat down to watch the movie. It is a film that will continue to live on well past our lifetimes, cementing the Count's immortality for generations to come.http\/\/juliekinnear.com\/blogs\/movies-realtors-Dracula ","genre":null},{"date":"28 October 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Universal Studio's 1931 production of Dracula is loosely based on Bram Stoker's Victorian novel of the same name.

The end result is an occasionally slow-paced swashbuckling sword-and-sorcery tale guaranteed to thrill those waiting for it to get a high-definition release.The mystical planet Krull is light-years beyond our universe. After it's invaded by a malevolent creature referred to as the Beast, Prince Colwyn (Ken Marshall) must rescue his damsel-in-distress (Lysette Anthony) from its deadly clutches. He journeys across the dangerous plains of his world to the sinister Black Fortress where she is being held captive. The fearless warrior recruits a motley band of wizards, thieves, and mythical beings to go up against the Beast's army of Slayers.The movie is rated PG for violence, gore, and frightening and intense scenes. Things get gooey whenever a slayer or agent of the Beast is killed. Their blood-smeared heads split open and a slimy alien parasite squirms out. If it takes on a human form and is killed, the body deflates like a balloon as it collapses to the ground. There's no profanity or nudity found in Krull. If Krull is trying to tell any sort of moral story, it would be that we can accomplish anything we set our minds to. You just have to work hard to reach your goal. It also teaches that good will always triumph over evil in the end. Some will consider that idea to be old-fashioned and naïve, but I still believe.Krull might take place in another galaxy, but it's still a very human and age-old medieval tale where the hero's journey leads to battling a vicious enemy and his minions.

The words Boogie Nights appear on the screen, but within the universe of the film; the name of a nightclub, which the camera spins away from and onto the entrance of another nightclub. The camera snakes inside, following several primary characters interacting with each other, while patrons dance and drink, all soundtracked by a rocking 70's soul tune. What a way to start a film. Paul Thomas Anderson was only 26 when he made this.In fact, looking at the context of the writer-director's age, it's a ridiculously ambitious movie. We are thrown, for 148 relentless minutes, into the world of the 70's porn industry, a challenging topic to make into an accessible film; but Anderson succeeds with ease. We sympathise with these strange characters and their strangely innocent world, and with Mark Wahlberg's well-meaning and well-endowed Dirk Diggler. Dirk, real name Eddie, is a lowly dishwasher at that nightclub in the first scene with a reputation for his gigantic member. Taken under the wing of Burt Reynolds' director, he grows to become a porn superstar. And then, just as Diggler's career hits its peak, it goes downhill as the 70's literally turns into the 80's. The fall side of this rise-and-fall plot is catalysed by, at a New Year 1980 party, one of the most shocking and brilliantly handled screen deaths I've ever seen. The film's second half is chaotic and messy, but feels intentionally so; the tight structure of the opening hour unravelling as the character's lives fall apart. I mentioned before the strange innocence of the porn industry. It's seen in the hilarious in-porn dialogue, in the Margherita-soaked parties, in Reynold's dream to be a real, artistically valid director making real art. As film gives way to video and that visual aesthetic is lost, we start to see the effects of drug abuse, of ego, of exploiting women, and of an industry that is dangerously linked to real crime. There is a violent scene in a donut shop that seems indulgent and pointless, and a subplot with Julianne Moore that doesn't really go anywhere. Some may feel that the running time is excessive, and they'd have a point; but I wasn't bored for a second. It's funny, shocking, sexy, ugly, and frightening at all the right moments. There's an obvious debt to Goodfellas in style, plot, and yes, the long shots; but it's never a pastiche or ripoff. That's partly because of Anderson's assured and confident direction, partly because California and porn offers such a nice contrast to New York and gangsters. John C Reilly and Philip Seymour Hoffman offer excellent supporting work, and the soundtrack is fantastic. Boogie Nights is vibrant, effortlessly entertaining and intelligently made cinema.

Nearly 25 years on and 'Predator' is still as fresh and gripping as it was in the eighties. Simply, everything works. If you don't know the plot (then you've probably been hiding in the jungle trying to avoid head-hunting monsters) it's about a team of commandos (lead by Arnold Schwarzenegger at the height of his fame) who get stalked by a particularly nasty alien hunter.Put simply... if you're a fan of either\/or action or science-fiction then you'll love this. But what makes it work when so many similar films have come and gone and been chalked up as nothing more than glorified copies? First of all is Arnold - an actor not always known for his acting abilities, but, when it comes to looking tough and firing guns (let alone mud-wrestling aliens) there can be no one better. His team, although never really given much screen time to really establish their real personalities, are also equally likable. Then there's the plot. There isn't really one. It's so simply, it barely needs explaining, i.e. alien vs soldiers in jungle (there are some sub plots about deceiving and male bonding, but they're over before you realise they're getting in the way of things). The creature itself is impressive. It was the first on screen baddie to really make use of 'invisibility' and its movements are all very 'alien' and different to anything ever before it. Then you have the action it's pretty relentless. The direction is simple and effective all the way through. It doesn't need today's flashy 'MTV' style editing to make it look cool. It is cool all by itself.The film's marketing tagline was, 'Nothing like it has ever been on Earth before...' and, in some ways, that could describe more than just the movie. There has never been a sci-fi action film as pure as Predator and anything that follows it will always have to pay homage to this - the original. Its successors (i.e. Predator 2, Alien vs Predator 1 and 2 and Predators) are all reasonable, but, even though they're about the same alien, they will never truly match up.Like sci-fi? Like action?

We don't murder; we kill. 'The Big Red One' (1980), was made particularly in order to show people what the 1st Infantry Division entering WWII were truly like and how ordinary men fought, bled, and died for our great nation throughout the many hellish war zones and situations some narrowly survived for a few fatal years. The director, Samuel Fuller (Pickup on South Street, Shock Corridor), known for his low-budget genre movies with controversial themes, here wanted to capture the true essence of what these ordinary men had to do to survive extraordinary circumstances the German artillery, D-Day on Omaha Beach in Normandy, a massive counterattack resulting in what became known as the Battle of the Bulge and other famous historical battles. Dodging gunfire and clinging to survival amidst dangerous war zones therein this gritty, gripping war flick, 'Big Red' is a loosely constructed epic account for reconstructing his Fuller's own days in Europe and North Africa between the years 1942 and 1945, displaying both raw power and a rough edge, all the while maintaining a cool and personal perspective that echoes his war-torn trials as they bleed from various moments throughout the picture as we sit there and witness it. So, did Fuller's version of what he personally experienced during the war truly capture the essence of it? Let's take a look.In October 1918, the patch as it is known, a red 1 on a solid olive green background, was officially approved for wear by members of the Division. Worn with pride, the patch symbolizes the legacy and tradition that binds all generations of those who have worn the Big Red One. On August 1, 1942, the first Division was recognized and redesignated as the 1st Infantry Division. The 1st Infantry Division entered combat in World War II as part of Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa, the first American campaign against the Axis powers that marched and combated through Algiers, Tunisia, Sicily, France, Belgium and then pushed into the German border. The Division continued its push into Germany, crossing the Rhine River. On December 16, twenty-four enemy divisions, ten of which were armored, launched a massive counterattack in the Ardennes sector, resulting in what became known as the Battle of the Bulge. The Big Red One held the critical shoulder of the Bulge at Bullingen, destroying hundreds of German tanks in the process. On Easter Sunday, April 1, 1945, the Division marched one-hundred fifty miles to the east of Siegen. On April 8, the Division crossed the Weser River into Czechoslovakia. The war was over May 8, 1945. Tragically at the end of WWII, there were over twenty-thousand casualties and over one hundred thousand prisoners of war had been taken. Forty-three thousand plus men had served in the ranks, winning a total of twenty-thousand plus medals and awards, including sixteen Congressional Medals of Honor. Nonetheless, the actors on the screen reflected just a glimpse of how the real soldiers back in the day fought for our great nation to the fullest extent. One of the main characters, Pvt. Griff (Mark Hamill), causes to violate his pacifist views because even amidst the chaos and utter destruction around him, he does not believe in and refuses to murder. He values life to the fullest extent. He lives in believing and even states that the true glory of war is actually surviving it. Griff's position in the infantry is a marksman, and a skilled one at that. Nonetheless, the horrors of his war years have finally caught up with him. He is finally stripped of his pacifist views in one scene as he fires every one of his last bullets into a lone German hiding in one of the ovens in a concentration camp used to exterminate the Jews. His face contorting into agony and despair as he does so, it is revealed to him and to the audience that WWII had finally wreaked a psychological toll on Griff, regardless of his heroism and bravery for his country. The horrors of war have finally gripped him into a reality where his pacifist views have come to a grinding halt in his mentality, knowing that his aspects will never again be the same from here on out.I do believe there is a difference between killing and murder. Even though The Sergeant (Lee Marvin) explained the difference in the beginning of the film, I had to agree with what he said. However, my thoughts on the certain matter is that killing is what you have to do in war or in dangerous life-threatening situations where you have to shoot the enemy in order to defend and protect something big or meaningful, their case being the United States and the people of America. Murder has no rational thought, such as randomly stabbing someone with a knife for example. Some people murder only to save themselves or if they are convicted criminals, not for something heroic like fighting for their homeland or for victory. The plot was all about surviving WWII, along with the many horrors that encompassed it as well. This was a wonderful picture altogether, with a glorious display of historical battles given as torn pages from a found war journal for us to relive, recount and remember.

'Glory' (1989) was certainly a new threshold in historical film archives providing the fact that it was really the first serious American movie about the Civil War to be made in years. It seemed that almost everything else prior had been nonsense or had used the war peripherally. But does the actual film itself truly capture the essence of the horrors of the Civil War had wrought, along with the horrors of racial prejudices and hate during that certain era? Let's take a look. The film opens in the year of 1862 on September 17th, just before the Battle of Antietam in Maryland. We hear a voice-over of a young twenty-three year old Bostonian captain, reading aloud as he writes to his mother. A few particles of his letters are also read aloud to him sporadically throughout the film after intense moments. Sooner than he had ever expected, he would eventually become colonel of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, leading an entire army of willing African-American men into battle, despite the heated bigotry of the time.The film stars wonderful actors, such as Matthew Broderick with his portrayal of the captain-turned-colonel Shaw was indeed a triumph and an emblem of hope against racism to the men in his entire battalion. The enlisted black men, some other main characters, include Denzel Washington (in an Oscar-winning role) who plays Private Silas Trip. Andre Braugher portrays a spectacled but very proper, Boston born-and-bred young black man, also an intellectual. Other characters include Morgan Freeman as gravedigger John Rawlins, who is the regiment philosopher of the film and eventually becomes a sergeant major. And then there is the shy, stuttering Private Jupiter Shats played by Jihmi Kennedy. Their being in the military ranks defies not only heroism but taking a stand against racism for the country that cruelly rejects them, even to the death.In discussing the history portrayed, it tells the viewer that it was once a time forty years before the end of the nineteenth century America where African-Americans were looked down upon and shunned because of their background or valued as nothing more than property nonetheless. When Col. Shaw agreed to accept the responsibility of leading the first ever army of African-Americans into battle, rejection was the first thing he was concerned about. He knew that these men wanted to fight and defend their country as well as any other man would have. No matter what the prejudices and despite the racial barriers that saturated their every day existence would soon diminish into the power of one race to prove that any man, no matter what his background or where he came from, can truly go the distance to the fullest extent.In prevailing attitudes\/prejudices that were noticeable, in fact very noticeable, would be the racial slurs, references and a heavy dose of the notorious n word that slathered the speech of practically every topic of African-American race. One example of racial condemnation would be when the recruits are working outside in the heat of the day and some passing white soldiers stop to watch them. Some of the main characters in the regiment stop working and approach them. When a soldier lashes out a racial comment, push comes to shove until it is broken up and the white troops march on. As they leave, some yell out vulgar racial obscenities referring to the recruits doing black jobs instead of fighting as white men should. Another example would be when the African-American recruits are even mean to each other in the base camp at night, one calling his fellow comrade the n word several times over. How they treated even those among them was truly deplorable.In describing historical accuracy, it probably comes as close as to how battles in the Civil War era were fought back in the day. The opening bloody Battle of Antietam in the beginning of the film as men were filled with spitting bullets and gunfire raining down on them was very realistic indeed amidst the anguished cries of death. Another epic and graphic scene was where Shaw charged with the 54th Massachusetts Regiment in a spectacular and even bloodier assault on Fort Wagner at the mouth of Charleston Bay on the afternoon and evening of July 18th, 1863. Cannons roared, blowing men to bits in the sand dunes, chocking the beach air with the thick smog of war.My overall reaction towards this film is that its directional debut by Edward Zwick is one of his best. His prowess and display of the wave of racial segregation amidst a world of war are as only he can portray them. The film was indeed worth watching for the two hours it ran. Some parts made me both sad and angry, including one of the film's least effective sequences with a raid on the tiny South Carolina village of Darien, during which Shaw was forced to succumb in following the orders by a superior officer to order his men to plunder and set fire to all the buildings. Another scene was where the 54th Massachusetts Regiment is reduced to be payed ten dollars a month, out of which three dollars would be withheld for clothing. White troops received thirteen dollars a month, plus a three dollar clothing allotment. Also, Shaw's black troops are further discriminated when their feet become blistered from drills in various weather conditions and are refused of getting any good shoes. It is assumed however that they will never see battle anyway.With Oscar-winning cinematography captured by Freddie Francis, the film making was excellent at showing the various emotions of each character. I believe Zwick chose to name his film as he did to compare and contrast overcoming racial tensions to blossom amidst the ugliness of war the soldiers fought for to earn respect and civility. That alone is a glory in and of itself. ","genre":null},{"date":"28 October 2014","score":"","review":" Give 'em Hell, 54! Give 'em Hell, 54!

As they leave, some yell out vulgar racial obscenities referring to the recruits doing black jobs instead of fighting as white men should. Another example would be when the African-American recruits are even mean to each other in the base camp at night, one calling his fellow comrade the n word several times over. How they treated even those among them was truly deplorable.In describing historical accuracy, it probably comes as close as to how battles in the Civil War era were fought back in the day. The opening bloody Battle of Antietam in the beginning of the film as men were filled with spitting bullets and gunfire raining down on them was very realistic indeed amidst the anguished cries of death. Another epic and graphic scene was where Shaw charged with the 54th Massachusetts Regiment in a spectacular and even bloodier assault on Fort Wagner at the mouth of Charleston Bay on the afternoon and evening of July 18th, 1863. Cannons roared, blowing men to bits in the sand dunes, chocking the beach air with the thick smog of war.My overall reaction towards this film is that its directional debut by Edward Zwick is one of his best. His prowess and display of the wave of racial segregation amidst a world of war are as only he can portray them. The film was indeed worth watching for the two hours it ran. Some parts made me both sad and angry, including one of the film's least effective sequences with a raid on the tiny South Carolina village of Darien, during which Shaw was forced to succumb in following the orders by a superior officer to order his men to plunder and set fire to all the buildings. Another scene was where the 54th Massachusetts Regiment is reduced to be payed ten dollars a month, out of which three dollars would be withheld for clothing. White troops received thirteen dollars a month, plus a three dollar clothing allotment. Also, Shaw's black troops are further discriminated when their feet become blistered from drills in various weather conditions and are refused of getting any good shoes. It is assumed however that they will never see battle anyway.With Oscar-winning cinematography captured by Freddie Francis, the film making was excellent at showing the various emotions of each character. I believe Zwick chose to name his film as he did to compare and contrast overcoming racial tensions to blossom amidst the ugliness of war the soldiers fought for to earn respect and civility. That alone is a glory in and of itself. ","genre":"Drama, History, War"}]
