Shrek completely goes against the grain in terms of fairy tale concepts by adding a whole new twist to the genre, and the result is nothing short of spectacular.Shrek (voice of Mike Myers) is an ugly green ogre living in a ramshackle house in the swamp by himself, without a care in the world.  When Lord Farquaad (voice of John Lithgow) banishes all fairy tale creatures from the land, Donkey (voice of Eddie Murphy), who talks too much, escapes from his owner and the clutches of the people who are taking him away, and goes to Shrek's swamp and begs Shrek to take him in, and Shrek unwillingly does just that.  When all the fairy tale creatures are dumped on his property, Shrek complains to Farquaad. Farquaad, a diminuitive lord with a superiority complex, wants to be king, and after consulting his magic mirror, he sees the woman he would like to have for his bride, and tells Shrek that he will remove the fairy tale creatures from his property if Shrek can bring him his future bride, Princess Fiona (voice of Cameron Diaz).This movie is probably one of the funniest animated movies I've seen in a long time.  I'm a Disney fan, but I've strayed from their fairy tale pictures due to a lack of interest, and have geared my interest to different (and original) animated stories.  This one is truly original in every way, even though it recycles familiar fairy tale characters (the 7 dwarfs, Pinochio, Cinderella, Snow White, Little Red Riding Hood, etc), but in a humorous way.  The actors themselves (Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow) are great in their parts, and the supporting voices and characters are what makes this film great.  There are so many inside jokes that this movie would tend to fly right over a child's head.  there are also alot of sight gags that the viewer would easily miss the first time around.I don't have one absolute favorite scene, because this whole movie was hysterically funny and smart.  However, some of them stand out in mind. The gingerbread man was classic, with the famous cookie lying on a cookie pan, legs broken off, with a glass of milk next to him.  His tourture was getting dipped in the milk and the threat of his buttons getting ripped off. When Farquaad tells him to confess, Gingerbread Man screams Eat me! and spits.  Another great scene was the Merry Men singing their song, which turns into the suspended-motion scene from The Matrix with Fiona lifting into the air in the karate-kick motion, the action freezes, the angle rotates, and Fiona kicks two Merry Men at the same time.  The part with the magic mirror was also hillarious.  I like how the mirror was honest with Farquaad, informing him that he really wasn't a king, and this isn't a kingdom, to which Farquaad gestures to Thelonious as to what happens to a lying mirror (Thelonious punches a small handheld mirror), and the mirror counteracts ...but you can be king, and shows three different women, Dating Game style.  The scene at Farquaad's amusement park was hillarious, especially with the It's a Small World-esque puppets singing.This was a great film, complete with a great cast, and is a fun story. This definitely breaks all those rules that fairy tales tend to set (and believe me, rules were made to be broken).  I am anxiously awaiting the sequel in 2004, and highly recommend this to everyone and their 5th cousin once removed (LOL!  just kidding). This is a great story of romance and wonder, and it is sure to be a hit for years to come.Donkey Hi, Princess. Fiona It talks!

I mean, seriously, what on earth was he snorting when he made this, talcum powder?As much as I have enjoyed most of his output over the years since discovering his animated short Vincent on The Disney Channel in 1984, I avoided this movie simply because I had a gut-wrenching feeling that it was going to be lousy simply because friends were warning me like anything not to see it, and also because it was based on a series of bubble gum cards. Since these details are also shared by the equally atrocious Garbage Pail Kids, I was convinced of this movie's awfulness.But there it was down at my local library, and I could watch it for free. So out of curiosity, I watched the dumb thing anyway. And how I wish somebody had been around to slap me hard for giving in to such a temptation, because even though I didn't have to pay a dime to see it I *still* feel ripped off. I feel like my time was wasted and that I'll also never be able to forget the stupid images this movie filled my brain with.So what exactly went wrong here? I'm not really sure and don't claim to understand the exact problem, but I think I have a pretty good idea the original bubble gum cards were meant as a serious piece of horror sci-fi. Burton, for some strange reason, apparently thought the cards were funny by nature and attempted to make a comedy out of them as they were. And in the end, the resulting film simply ends up saying a lot about the nature of Tim's sense of humour than it does about the audience's. As a result, many of the bits which are obviously intended to be funny simply come across as sick, twisted and appealing to only a severely limited audience with the same idea.   What's particularly disappointing here is that so much strong talent is wasted here and not given much to do with. The characters simply end up getting offed in one way or another, and not particularly humourously either.Which leads to one of the movie's oddest problems, which is linked to both of the points I've made above many of the scenes are played straight as they are, and Burton seems to think that the stuff itself is funny by its very nature instead of attempting to add any genuine humour or joy to them.WARNING spoilers ahead.An excellent example of this is the whole scene in which a TV reporter has her head switched with her dog's on board a martian ship. After performing said experiment (the martians have an unbelievably cruel sense of humour in this film), her head--still alive and in a jar of fluid--is carried over just so she can be shown what has been done so she can scream in horror. This routine, obviously being done by the martians out of sheer maliciousness (they have absolutely no motivation except to torment everybody, and it's difficult to have villains of any sort be convincing or entertaining when they have no clear purpose to either cheer against or laugh about), is played straight; it comes across as a drug-induced nightmare as opposed to a weird Hollywood prank with special effects.By comparison, another related situation to this idea is handled in a way that *does* come close to working, and also provides one of the only two amusing gags in the whole movie (and also demonstrates why the rest of it simply doesn't work). After the TV reporter and her previous guest, as heads, discover each other aboard the martian ship, they don't appear to notice whatsoever what has happened to each other personally--they simply continue flirting with each other, the precise way they were while being broadcast on television, as if absolutely nothing was out of the ordinary! The best humour is always based on irony, especially this sort, and that's the attitude that's missing throughout the rest of Mars Attacks!.The other amusing bit is in the way the martians are defeated in the end. I won't bother going into details, I'll simply say that it struck me as a deliberate homage to Attack of The Killer Tomatoes and leave it at that. The only problem is, Killer Tomatoes was much funnier in how it handled the same premise. (What's that? I'm actually saying that something about Killer Tomatoes is better than a Tim Burton flick?! HELP!)I'll stick with Burton's other films, thank you very much. Fortunately, he strongly rebounded with Sleepy Hollow later on, so I know he hasn't lost his touch. But every artist eventually creates a mistake, and that's a normal process for a strong talent willing to take chances. Burton deserves a lot of credit for taking such a strong risk it's just that the risk didn't create a good movie. Oh well, live and learn from one's mistakes, and it always improves your future material somehow down the road...

Amos also yells at Widow Tweed for letting it happen. She finally decides it's time to let Todd live out in the wild so the next day she drives into the forest and leaves him. Todd doesn't adjust well to the outside world. He runs afoul of a surly badger. He even meets a girl fox, or vixen, Vixey. They become friends. But Amos Slade was eager to get revenge on Todd so he and Copper go get him. Todd saves Copper's life when he wrestles a giant grizzly bear. Copper doesn't allow Amos to shoot Todd so he doesn't.            So our story has a happy ending. It kind of relates to Bambi, don't you think? All-star voices here Keith Coogan is young Todd, Corey Feldman is young Copper. Mickey Rooney is grown-up Todd and Kurt Russell is grown-up Copper. Pat Buttram is Chief. Jack Albertson is Amos. Winnie the Pooh veterans John Fiedler and Paul Winchell are here too. So if you're a fan of Disney pictures and like this particular genre, this one is for you!- ","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"17 October 2002","score":"68 out of 99 people found the following review useful","review":"  So here's this movie Flashdance which has been staring me in the face for years, both in pop culture for over half of my life and on the video rental store shelves, and yet I've never gotten around to checking it out until now.I was fifteen when this movie was first out and popular. I heard the soundtrack, of course, and loved it to pieces... but I had never been able to watch the movie because it was rated R.I had grown up having it be, in an odd sort of way, both a part of my life and at the same time *not* a part of my life. I was familiar with its music, images, and even its basic plot outline, but had never seen the movie.And as an adult, I felt extremely dubious about checking it out. Over the years, I had heard that people either loved it to pieces or hated it. I've heard critics both call it uplifting and fun while others called it nothing more than a string of glittering little music videos strung together on an extremely thin strand of plot (a creation device for a LOT of MTV-era movies such as Top Gun, Footloose and Purple Rain).To add to my confusion about whether or not I should give it a try, I had had the same experience with Saturday Night Fever I grew up loving the soundtrack to pieces but having never seen the movie... and when I finally did I felt utter disappointment at first, discovering the film to be far darker than expected. Oh sure, I later liked Fever okay (actually, I should use the term appreciated) but still preferred the gorgeous soundtrack to the actual film that was the basis for its existance.Would I have the same experience with Flashdance?Tonight, I finally decided to, as one character in the film puts it, hold my breath and take the plunge.As it turns out, I found it to be a surprisingly charming, entertaining and uplifting film. I was fearing it to be something raunchy, but at it turns out it has a very special, starry-eyed sweet innocence that is difficult to define.The performance of the equally starry-eyed and innocent Jennifer Beals helps, of course. She brings a wide-eyed sparkle and hopefulness to her role, plus a determination to keep her life on the right track precisely as she feels it ought to go without any major morality screwups, and this adds a wonderful flavour of hope and childlike wonder to her character Alex that just simply grows on you.Now, it IS true that there are a few flaws here and there, and a couple of editing flaws as well. Plus, the other characters aren't really as developed as hers (but they are developed just enough to demonstrate to her personally the various dos and don'ts regarding attitudes to have while pursuing a dream, voices for her to observe and learn from representing both directions). But none of that matters because the film has a charm all its own. Looking at it today, I can easily see why so many out there loved it its a beautiful and very encouraging little film. It has a heroine whom anybody could relate with and like; it has wonderful music in it; it has a delicate and lighthearted touch to it which, language and a couple of scenes aside (such as the film's most heartbreaking scene in which Alex saves a desperate friend from throwing life away in a strip joint (a sequence which only lasts about two minutes long--but it's sad and disturbing, not Oooh, let's put this in to grab male members of the audience!--which is most likely the only ingredient to earn the film its R rating)), is nevertheless still so pure and true that it could have come straight out of a '70s-made Walt Disney Productions movie (!!!); it's touching and moving... and, of course, it has dance sequences which are fun to watch.In other words, it was a comforting and uplifting movie released during a time when people, youngsters with career goals in particular, needed one. And if anything, folks still need movies like that out today. It's a happy little film with a happy ending which isn't overdone or unconvincing, and precisely the sort of flick which should be perscribed to those suffering severe depression. Heaven knows that I myself certainly felt encouraged about my own career and life in particular after watching it!It might not be for everybody, but if the above description I've written voices the sort of movie you personally enjoy then do yourself a big favour and give it a try. Chances are that if you are as naturally starry-eyed and hopeful as Alex is--and believe me, *I* certainly am--then you will easily relate to this delightful little fable.
