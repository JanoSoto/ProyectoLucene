I think this movie is underrated - in my opinion mainly because it's a remake of a Hitchcock classic. People think that No one should mess with Hitchcock, because they are going to just fail compared to him. This may be true, but I think this movie is underrated. For starters, it does not have the same plot - not even close. There are many surprises for people who have seen the original Hitch movie. In fact, they are essentially a different movie, the main plot line is very different. Only the theme is similar. It has also very good acting by three of the main actors, plus lot of suspense. It kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end. This comes from a person who has seen the original Hitchcock movie dozen of times. People shouldn't rate movies badly, because they are remakes (or sequels). If they bring something new to the table, they are justified. You don't have to reinvent the wheel every time, composers and musicians take influences from old music all the time, then they add SOMETHING new, but something in hit songs is always familiar and done before. Having influences is not necessarily a bad thing. ","genre":null},{"date":"21 August 2014","score":"","review":" I'm gonna give it a 9, to fix a bit the bad IMDb score.

Cold blooded and ruthless, he is very much a man on a mission.Adapted by director Mike Hodges from the novel Jack's Return Home by Ted Lewis, this is deliberately paced, but the cast is simply superb and Hodges does an expert job at depicting the seamy British underworld. Among the suspects is a slimy pornographer, Cyril Kinnear (John Osborne); other lowlifes are portrayed by Ian Hendry and Bryan Mosley.

At a time where movies were made for entertainment, some challenged movie-goers with some of the most controversial subject matter ever to be put on film. Many of today well known directors were starting out big with their first feature length movie. But, Martin Scorsese was one of those directors who really captured what the 1970's were all about. He shows us all of it in this film.Travis Bickle, (Robert De Niro), is an loner who spends most of his time prowling the streets of New York City at night. An Vietnam veteran, he narrates the story with a flat, eerie voice that somehow gives the movie an very dark tone to it. All of the animals come out at night, he says. Someday a real rain'll come and wash all this scum off the streets. Suffering from insomnia, he also spends some of his time watching porno movies and living in an apartment building, where welfare seems to cover everything. One day, he spies on a woman, (Cybill Shepard), who is working at a campaign headquarters. At first, Bickle develops an crush on her and even asks her out on a date. But, she rejects him because of his habit of seeing dirty movies. Isolating himself from society, Bickle starts to tense up and decides that the only way to strike back is with violence. In one of the most memorable scenes in the movie, Bickle practices his intimidation by talking to a wall and says, Are you talking to me? Talking to me? Well, I'm the only one here. By the end of the movie, Bickle's violent behavior and actions reaches a bloody climax when he gets his chance. The movie is more of a character study between different personalities. Travis and the woman he loves come from different backgrounds. Screenwriter Paul Schrader illustrates these characters by experimenting with each others likes and feelings. But toward a more thought-provoking point, the movie showcases an long-lasting argument between an dream and a reality. The woman that Travis loves is shown to be an angelic figure, one who's blessed. But, when mental deterioration crosses with her presence, nothing is ever forgiving. From there on, Bickle puts himself through intense training to avenge society. His thirst of violence intensifies when he goes to a gun dealer and buys several guns off of him. The cast of the movie is outstanding. Not only De Niro steals the show, but the movie has a strong supporting cast including Jodie Foster, as a teenage hooker who befriends Travis, Albert Brooks, as the man who's interested in Cybill Shepard, but dislikes Travis and also Harvey Keitel and Peter Boyle stars in this masterpiece as well.Bernard Herrmann creates a strong and resounding score that has a jazzy sense to it. The score is perhaps the most important piece in the movie because Herrmann is master of scoring movies that makes the film more atmospheric with its grimy look of New York City. The sound of the score illustrates the mind of Travis Bickle. When we first see him, his eyes curiously looks around while exhaust fumes fill the screen. Even the red tint on the neon lit signs makes the setting of the movie looks like a hell. Several times through the entire movie, the color red symbolizes a world where hope is not present, but Travis' inner demons are hovering all over him. Like his score in Vertigo, Herrmann makes an hypnotizing sense of insomnia, alienation and isolation.Robert De Niro has never given an better performance of his career. His performance in Taxi Driver is an template of what movie acting is all about. When he grins for the first time in the movie, we get the notion that his appearance is rather frightening, but very mysterious. The way he grins by giving that eerie smile makes Travis Bickle believable. We know from the beginning of the movie that he's not a hero even though the people around him praised him for what he did to Iris. As for Jodie Foster, she doesn't glamorizes her role as Iris. She is trying to get out of the city, but she needs Travis to help her. That on-screen performance is something to look for. Her performance is an essential part of the whole movie.Martin Scorsese does a outstanding job directing this movie. He really knows New York City. He knows how to hook the viewer and take them on a journey through the rough streets of every neighborhood in the city. His way of making characters into sinners is something mesmerizing. The shots of the rain wetting the streets. The way the windshield wipers wipes off the rain on Travis' cab when he travels through the night. The symbolism of what Scorsese shows you is something to study on. You have to pay attention to every speck of detail he gives you. Even when the characters stop to chat for a while, pay attention to how they talk to one another. That's what makes it such a great film. It's movies like Taxi Driver that captures a time not long forgotten, but long gone. Both the cinema world and to the world of the 1970's. ★★★★ 4 stars.

The story is not drawn out or anything and is one of the best things about it, it doesn't try to be a fantastic movie and knows where it's limits are. It kind of thrills all the way through and at certain points you may really be rooting for Bill and Ted. I felt the film was just about good, and here below is why so.The story as said is fun and also comedic and that really mixes well here to create a film that will make you laugh but also let you just enjoy yourself whilst watching it.

They had been recruited in great numbers by Roosevelt's administration but they were kept in separate units with only white officers at their head. The Blacks though could be promoted to non- commissioned officer positions which was already a great improvement on what they called the first war. Waiting too long in Tynen, Louisiana, some rivalries appear among the Black men, especially since the sergeant of this unit, Sergeant Waters, is using his position and this long wait to get rid of those he does not like as representative of the Black race because he considers this second war is going to change the fate of the Blacks in America and those who are just fools, clowns, those who sing to make people happy and entertain them are not and should not be legitimate members of the race. By using his power to victimize one soldier he considered such a clown, on his own recollection of how a black soldier was mistreated in Café Napoleon in Paris in the first war into playing the black monkey, half nude with a tail attached to his bottom and eating bananas for the fun of the customers, he manages to bring this black soldier here in Tynen to breaking point and committing suicide.One night this very sergeant gets killed when drunk and on his way back to the base. Everyone says it is the Ku Klux Klan. But it is not. Too simple.Washington DC sends a lawyer with the rank of Captain to investigate. He is the first black officer everyone sees, and I should say to emphasize the occasion for the first time. Reaction are tremendous joy among the black soldiers and very dubitative if not hostile reactions from the white officers since the unit works on a de facto segregated basis with the officers' club only hosting white men since all officers are white. But the Captain sent by Washington is black and that is a shock to the local officers, and what's more to have this investigating officer, accompanied by the local captain responsible for security, coming to the club to interrogate two white officers in the billiards room, or pools room if you prefer. We are thus led to the belief that these two officers had something to do with the death of the sergeant. But that's where we are wrong of course. Too simple.I won't tell you who did it but it has to do with judging who is fit to be a negro and who is not fit to be one. Sergeant Waters did it first and before anyone and others decided that they had the same right and that Sergeant Waters, as a black man, had to be eliminated from the racial plate as unfit for the future. When we look back at the history of Blacks in the USA after the Civil War and their emancipation (amendments 13 and 14 to the US Constitution), we find out that on both sides of the racial divide, the main question is always who or what type of black man is fit to be a black man in the present situation and for the future. The Ku Klux Klan wanted to control the Blacks at least politically by using frightening violence. But you find out that Booker T. Washington was supporting one type of Black people, though he did not reject the others and just suggested they should get educated his way. Marcus Garvey is very expansive on his vision of what black people should be and how they should behave and he rejects, at times very vociferously, those who do not fit his model. The various black movements, NAACP, Nation of Islam, Black Panther Party, Black Nationalists, etc, all have a clear definition of what Blacks should be and how they should behave, what religion must be their inspiration, what objectives they should have and how they should advocate them and reach them, etc. That's exactly the point here some then have the tendency to reject those who do not fit their definition, reject them by ostracizing them, victimizing them, hassling them, or even killing them. Who has the right, black or white, to decide who is fit to be a black man or not?The film is a little bit old. This question is today slightly obsolete, but the question can be generalized and taken away from the racial divide. As soon as there is a clear cut divide that creates some antagonism, on both side of the divide they pretend they know who is fit to be on their side or on the other side. On both side of a divide people live with clichés. Even if today the question of gay rights is pretty active along that line, the Case of Ferguson, Missouri, and the killing of unarmed Michael Brown by a police officer who shot at least six bullets shows the racial divide is still not erased in the USA, still on August 9, 2014.

Did I even watch the same movie these guys did?The movie starts on Krypton, a surprisingly dull set piece that looks more like something cooked up by a designer who is very rich, yet lacking in imagination. Nothing makes it really stand out as a truly alien world, making for a rather forgettable set piece.Once Superman arrives on Earth, we see his origin story, which doesn't particularly stand out to me, largely due to the movie not really examining what his experience with his powers are like when he is young and can't control him. Another point of contention is that when he is 18, he is played by an actor who doesn't fit the look of Superman. We get to the part where he works at the daily planet, which is watchable.The acting is decent, for the most part, I'll give the movie that much. But I honestly feel it could have been put to better use.Now, for the plot. My first problem with this is that the missiles Lex Luthor steals would not be transported in any state for which they would be assembled and fit to use for the safety hazards this would pose. My second problem is that even a 100 megaton yield hydrogen bomb on top of a fault line would not be enough to cause a major earthquake. If Lex Luthor was such a brilliant scientist, he should have known that. It just doesn't make sense.My third problem is that Superman brings Lois Lane back from the dead by reversing time itself by going backwards around the Earth (with terrible yet unintentionally funny special effects), which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. It also kills what precious little suspense was there to begin with because Superman could theoretically keep doing this whenever he felt like it. It really just felt like the writers wrote themselves into a corner and pulled something out of their asses to keep the plot going.This movie suffers from a terminally bland character who is never endangered by anything but kryptonite, and whose only personality trait is nice and other slight variants. We never see any of the dilemmas a godlike alien who was the last of his species and an alien to the planet he lives on would face. Instead, we see a smiling, perfect hero who is not merely incapable of doing wrong, but incapable of being tempted. If nice and perfect are the only personality traits one has to go by, than it becomes meaningless. The smiling, easygoing hero feels forced and fake.I have heard that Superman being nigh invincible is interesting when he has to avoid being tempted to use his powers for selfish purposes, which would be true if he was capable of being tempted.With poor special effects, a plot greatly weakened by holes and general lack of logic and an overdramatic score that blares out even when nothing of importance happens, I got one of the biggest disappointments of my childhood in this movie. And what frustrates me the most is that if Superman could be written so he is less one dimensional, it would be a movie worth seeing. Ultimately, though, this movie is a dull, unfulfilling exercise in wasted potential lack character development, a good plot, a good score and decent\/interesting special effects.

This film promises a hip, new, action-packed rendition of the classic British spy show a slick hybrid of explosive action, thrills, and quirky humor.The film definitely tries its best to be quirky, to the point where nearly every scene is weird and off-the-wall. Such eccentricities include a council of villains who dress up as giant teddy bears. There are at least a couple of scenes where old ladies whip out throwing knives or machine guns. The heroes are chased by robot bees at one point. One of the characters has an evil clone, with no explanation as to how or why. There are oodles of other odd things going on here, but the film pushes its quirkiness over the top with its script, in which every single line is a pun. Seriously, nobody ever talks normally in this film every line is a funny remark, and it can get old really fast. The spaces in between these odd parts are filled up with fighting, explosions, chases, fighting, explosions, fighting, and more fighting! My personal experience with this film has always been mixed; it's something I always wanted to like, but never could. The standard tropes of outlandish spy thrillers are there, and the action can be okay to watch at times. Unfortunately, the storytelling makes this a far duller experience, because there is no real story here to tell. With a whopping 28 minutes cut from the film in post-production, the plot is reduced to a constant string of action scenes, one after another, with zero character development, and zero reasoning given for why things happen on screen. In the end, it's hard to really latch onto this film beyond the aesthetics.And the aesthetics get the job done. Photography isn't too bad. Editing is pretty stupid. Everybody in this film hams up their performances to match the quirky nature of the film. Ralph Fiennes bears a crud-eating grin the whole time, but still manages to channel enough charm and wit to make the most out of what he's given. Uma Thurman is pretty much reprising her role as Poison Ivy from B&R. Sean Connery doesn't seem to give a flying rip about anything, and in spite of that he seems to be the only one here taking his role seriously, even when he struts around in a kilt. I have no idea what Jim Broadbent and Eddie Izzard are doing here. Writing is horrible. This production uses okay-looking sets, props, and costumes. Special effects have not aged well. Joel McNealy's score is annoyingly repetitive and loud (which is a shame, because the movie's theme is not bad per se, and the CD soundtrack has been a favorite of mine since high school).There may have been potential in this film somewhere, but so much of the story has been carved out in post-production that it leaves only a threadbare semblance of a plot, and a ton of frivolous action and ridiculous scenes. It's an interesting oddity at times, and a glorious guilty pleasure in its own right, but overall, it is the ultimate example of how a film with all style and no substance can fall flat on its face.2\/5 (Entertainment Pretty Good | Story Awful | Film Marginal) ","genre":null},{"date":"21 August 2014","score":"","review":" This is it one of the most notorious critical failures in blockbuster history.

And with most child stars, when they grow up, by the time they pass age 30, they aren't so popular? Well, in 1917, everybody in the States knew Baby Jane Hudson, or formally Jane Hudson, a blonde, blue-eyed little girl dressed all in pink, who sang and danced on stage in front of fans of all ages, her act partner being her own father, a man who used to love his family until his daughter's fame went to his head and made him care about only making Jane happy. His depressed-looking wife and neglected daughter Blanche watch on from behind the stage as Jane does all her performances, then her dad offers the merchandise for sale, most commonly the doll modeled to look just like Jane. After each performance, behind the stage and glamor, the troubled family is seen. Jane is a very spoiled brat who gets anything she asks for, but she does care for her sister, trying to persuade her dad to buy Blanche some ice cream. When Blanche tries to be polite and says she doesn't need any, her father snaps at her. Blanche's mother tells her privately that the tables will turn one day...In 1935 Blanche is a new and popular adult actress and is doing high-rated movies. No longer a cute and charming child star, Jane is a fat alcoholic who often goes home and sleeps with men she doesn't even know, basically a free prostitute. Being a kind person, Blanche tries to get her agents to allow Jane to play small roles in some of the movies, but most people think Jane is a lousy actress and that her talent faded as she got older. One night a mysterious car crash happens, Jane is heard screaming, and somehow Blanche is paralyzed in the crash.By 1962 the sisters are both retired, living off their acting money in a large house in the suburbs of California. Blanche never leaves the house, the neighbors remark. The only one to ever leave the house is Jane; she often buys groceries, and loads of alcohol. A maid comes in every day to tidy the house. Behind closed doors, Jane is a violent and sadistic drunk, doing nasty things to Blanche like killing her pet parakeet and throwing her fan mail in the garbage barrels. The maid (Elvira), has a conversation with Blanche in secret about how Jane is reaching a psychotic state of mind and should be sent to a mental asylum, but Blanche can't do that to her. Jane is severely depressed, often hallucinating herself as a child doing her acts again but then seeing her older self in the mirror, which drives her more towards the breaking point. As the movie progresses, Jane goes to more and more extreme lengths to make sure all attention is on her the way it used to be. And since Blanche is in a wheelchair for life, she can't even leave the upper floor of the house without Jane.This movie was pretty shocking and sad, did have some comedic moments, but also some moments that really revealed what can happen to a child when they are always spoiled. The soundtrack was great and the movie is fictional but based on a novel by the same name. It stars Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, both great actresses. One of the most shocking moments in the film was the beach scene, when the mystery of the accident that paralyzed Blanche is revealed. Blanche had tried to kill Jane when she became an annoying and inconvenient burden, but Jane got scared and ran away, leaving Blanche instead crashing into a fence and not killing Jane, which is my she was paralyzed. Jane then remarks, so... all this time we could have been friends? and her remaining sanity deteriorates to the point where she is acting like a child in public, trying to play with other children on the beach and excitedly begging for strawberry ice cream. Jane is depicted as a disgusting and sadistic drunk monster though the film, but towards the end it is hard not to at least pity her.Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? is not only creepy and bizarre, but very thought-provoking and disturbing, in some ways like the 1956 film 'the Bad Seed'.

The maid (Elvira), has a conversation with Blanche in secret about how Jane is reaching a psychotic state of mind and should be sent to a mental asylum, but Blanche can't do that to her. Jane is severely depressed, often hallucinating herself as a child doing her acts again but then seeing her older self in the mirror, which drives her more towards the breaking point. As the movie progresses, Jane goes to more and more extreme lengths to make sure all attention is on her the way it used to be. And since Blanche is in a wheelchair for life, she can't even leave the upper floor of the house without Jane.This movie was pretty shocking and sad, did have some comedic moments, but also some moments that really revealed what can happen to a child when they are always spoiled. The soundtrack was great and the movie is fictional but based on a novel by the same name. It stars Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, both great actresses. One of the most shocking moments in the film was the beach scene, when the mystery of the accident that paralyzed Blanche is revealed. Blanche had tried to kill Jane when she became an annoying and inconvenient burden, but Jane got scared and ran away, leaving Blanche instead crashing into a fence and not killing Jane, which is my she was paralyzed. Jane then remarks, so... all this time we could have been friends? and her remaining sanity deteriorates to the point where she is acting like a child in public, trying to play with other children on the beach and excitedly begging for strawberry ice cream. Jane is depicted as a disgusting and sadistic drunk monster though the film, but towards the end it is hard not to at least pity her.Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? is not only creepy and bizarre, but very thought-provoking and disturbing, in some ways like the 1956 film 'the Bad Seed'. It's unforgettable, and definitely worth watching.

I had no idea that Time Warp came from this movie.I understand that at the time, this was a huge achievement for homosexuals and trans-genders, but now in 2014, this movie holds no relevance, nor does it entice the viewer.

It is easily one of my all time favourite series' of films. In watching them again recently, I was immediately struck with how well the series has aged in plot, characters and special effects but also how completely different each instalment of this series is. Usually with any series of films, they all have a common style and feel like Lord of The Rings or Star Wars and certainly Back To The Future seamlessly fits together but each and every one of them is as different as they possibly can be. Back To The Future 3 played on Zemeckis' love of old school Westerns (something I feel as well) and he does it nearly perfectly. If you step back and look at this movie and ignore the time travel aspect, it holds its own as a Western. You have the dusty Western town, the old tavern, gun fights, festivals, trains and robberies. It has everything and that makes it incredibly fun. Add in to the fact that you already are completely hooked on Marty and Doc's adventure and everything they've been through and this is one of the most fun times you can have watching a movie. They couldn't have wrapped this up much better than this.Cleverly, each and every instalment of this series is fresh and they do that by keeping the main characters ever evolving. The difference between the Marty McFly of Back To The Future 1 and 2 was very evident and this time Marty is sort of more like he was in the first film. Christopher Lloyd's Doc is the one who gets the huge character development this time around. It doesn't matter how you shake it, Michael J. Fox and Christopher LLoyd are flat out amazing in their respective roles and they have amazing chemistry opposite each other. Lloyd's Doc Brown is significantly less zany and eccentric and more controlled and gets to fall in love and he's the level headed one this time around. He is by far more heroic in this sequel and we, as fans, welcome that!! Mary Steenburgen joins the cast as Lloyd's love interest and she is terrific. She is just a tad bit cheesy and sort of southern school ma'arm type and it works perfect. She has terrific chemistry with Lloyd and the only downside is we don't get to see more from her. She is a welcomed addition to the cast. Thomas F. Wilson proves his villainous versatility yet again playing Mad Dog Tannen, the crazy wild west killer and does it perfectly. He even gets to play it more seriously than his previous Biff incarnations. Lea Thompson is one again reduced but this time is just barely a cameo in the movie which is a little unfortunate since she was so good in the first film. Elisabeth Shue is also barely a blip on the casting list as Marty's girlfriend back in 1985.Nothing touches the first film. That movie is one of the best ever made period. However, Robert Zemeckis took that idea and went crazy with it in all the best ways and created two bizarre, out there, insanely fun sequels that are as different from the first as they are from each other. I could never tell you my favourite parts of Back To The Future without listing a half dozen scenes from the second film and from this one. Where'd you learn to shoot like that? Pie plate Frisbee, the incredible climactic train scene at the end which easily rivals any of the best scenes of this trilogy or of any modern day blockbuster. Each and every time I watch it I am literally on the edge of my seat watching it. Its fantastic and Zemeckis proves why he is one of the best directors out there. No matter which instalment is your favourite you have to pay respect to how terrific they all are and you have to watch them as one giant epic and this one was as good as ever this time around. I look forward to watching my favourite trilogy again soon!! 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 August 2014","score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" As a whole I absolutely adore the Back To The Future trilogy.
