[{"date":"23 July 2009","score":"","review":" People say a lot of things about Chaplin's immortality. Actually, they say only one thing many times, over and over again he is eternal, his films will live forever, a hundred or two hundred years from now humanity will still turn to Charles Chaplin for joy and relief from whatever burdens they may have, as like or unlike our own as those may be. My gut tells me there is truth in this belief, but I don't think with my gut. To be honest, I am not that optimistic. And my doubts don't spring from common sense, either; common sense says, of course, someday everything disappears - so will Chaplin. But other than that, I, as a 17-year-old, know absolutely no one of a similar age that likes Chaplin or remembers having seen any of his movies in recent times. All kids in Pakistan used to see them, and maybe they still do, but no one bothers to stick to it as the years pass. Tom and Jerry et al are still on TV - their place in public consciousness is continuously reinforced; they can legitimately claim timelessness. But what about all the 17-year-olds that would rather watch 'Transformers' and have only dim memories of a funny little man in a shabby top hat, ones that like movies only in passing, without passion? How will these poor people - and they are poorer for it - find 'City Lights'? This is a truly magnificent film. Its enduring greatness (if not enduring popularity) can, of course, be attributed to nostalgia - but only in part. You need never have heard of Charlie Chaplin to enjoy it. It also has the common advantage of all silent films in that it knows no linguistic boundaries; the story, unlike that of a Buster Keaton film, is simple and silent enough that one does not really need even the sparse title cards to follow it. Keaton's films, while silent, tended to be rather talkative, requiring the viewer to do quite a bit of reading. Chaplin is perhaps more widely known than Keaton because he, unlike the latter, can be understood by people who cannot read English or any language at all.Chaplin's comedic timing is flawless. This is not, perhaps, Chaplin's funniest film, but it strings together sequence after hilarious sequence of classic slapstick nevertheless the opening scene on the monument, the one with the suicidal millionaire, the one in the restaurant (my personal favorite), the boxing match - each is immediately familiar and unfailingly funny. (Sophisticated humor? No doubt it has its skillful practitioners and talented writers. I love it. But is it, when you get right down to it, actually any funnier than watching a chair pulled out from under someone's descending rear end? Not on this evidence.) But what sets 'City Lights' apart from other Chaplin films, and classical comedy in general, is its heart.The story is, as I mentioned, disarmingly simple. Chaplin plays The Tramp, a homeless man with an odd mustache, a top hat and a cane, who is always in trouble because of his social ineptitude. He is persecuted because of his shabby appearance. He meets a girl that sells flowers who is kind to him, possibly only because she is blind and thinks he is a gentleman. He saves the life of a drunken millionaire, whose help he needs when the girl has trouble paying her rent. Obstacles arise. The obstacles are the comedy.That really is it. It does not, on paper, sound like masterpiece material, but it is brought to life - partly by humor, yes - but primarily by Chaplin's persona as the Tramp. The Tramp is one of cinema's greatest personalities, the people's champion to end them all. His perennially good intentions, his unflagging good cheer, his clumsiness, his social inadequacy, his underdog status and his constant bedevilment by ridiculous misfortune make us cheer, cheer, cheer like we never have for any other character. It is quite possible that of all the great people invented by the silver screen, Chaplin's Tramp is the easiest to love, and love the most.The movie is, of course, a great technical achievement. It is boundlessly entertaining. Each quirky character, from the flower girl to the millionaire to the class conscious butler, serves its purpose in moving the story towards it conclusion. The conclusion, of course, is one of the finest emotional scenes in movie history; in fact, in its length and low-key conclusion, without fanfare or fireworks, anticipates in a strange way the French New Wave. The ending is abrupt. I spoil nothing by saying you will be joyful when it comes.One of the greatest of all movies. Most highly recommended.

Now after some years I went back to it and it still holds although it aged badly. That doesn't make it a bad movie, in my opinion the age made it unintentionally funny and that what kept me watching.The story follows pretty much the same story as the movie Ghostship (which is even more unintentionally silly) - there is a ship wreck in space, a team is sent to search & rescue and they all get slaughter. Much alike Ghostship there is a plot twist which is unexpected and makes no sense but sure is great to watch.But what makes this movie bearable is pure comedy on screen. We start with Sam Neil as Dr Weir (thats a villain name alright) in a bathroom on a rescue ship. He has a large mirror and a bathtub (his room sure is spacious for a starship. Of course there is normal gravitation all around. You wouldn't guess how astronauts in 2047 shave - with a RAZOR. His attention is drawn by a dripping tap, the tap itself has no levers so I guess Neil thought to himself I should have went for a premium space-tub. Also all this space plumbers must be lazy not to fix the tap before a mission. We then visit the bridge where everybody have roller chairs (what if the gravity generator malfunctioned?) and spit stupid one-liners like its all blinking on my screen. The captain is Morpheus (played by Morpheus=) and he makes little more sense unless you count an odd leather jacket - is it the part of official uniform? The crew goes into some deep sleep chambers (like in alien but with water) and Doctor Weir wakes up first, everybody is sleeping and computer is silent. Don't you know that this is a nightmare already? This ends with a comedic AAAAAaaaaAAA by Sam Neil, wasn't he embarrassed by doing a scene like that? After they wake up they found out that they are near Neptun and complain (didn't they know where the ship was headed?). Also its up to Weir to explain to the crew how the government made a ship faster than light. Impossibly the crew is smart enough to tell this is impossible. This scene is priceless because again it hard not to pity Sam Neil to explain the unexplainable. He starts with saying how they managed to fold space time, is it similar to time on Earth? Than 5 minutes before they reach the wreck Dr Weir(d) plays them the one transmission that they've got from it - the recording consist of loud screams and a mad voice saying save me in Latin. NOW, thats a good hint 5 MINUTES before boarding the vessel! wow =) The team goes to the ships, find it awfully quiet and than find stupid excuses to to wander off and get slaughtered. The big (no) secret is that the ship basically been to HELL and back. That very original. Whats unoriginal is why the ship finds some sneaky way to kill the characters instead of turning the life support off. The design of the capable-of-speed-of-light spaceship is questionable to say the lest. To get to engineering part you have to go trough a section that looks like a meat grinder and the engine itself looks like torture chamber fantasy. Seriously why a a engine would even need so many spikes? and sharp parts. I think the engine is powered on dangerous environment alone. The core is a liquid stable substance and the character exhibits whats seems to be a matrix syndrome to put the whole hand into unknown substance. What kind of engineer does that? I like the set-up but the rest of the film that follow is sub-par we see a lot of gore (people with gouged eyes, parts of people falling from the ceiling, people crushed) and all the characters do nothing but invent stupid ways to get out of the ship. The plot twist is indeed unexpected (although not shocking) but at the same time gives no hints as why it happened.Its a funny little flick that is more disgusting than scary but I don't think there is an abundance of this kind of horrors.

I like the set-up but the rest of the film that follow is sub-par we see a lot of gore (people with gouged eyes, parts of people falling from the ceiling, people crushed) and all the characters do nothing but invent stupid ways to get out of the ship. The plot twist is indeed unexpected (although not shocking) but at the same time gives no hints as why it happened.Its a funny little flick that is more disgusting than scary but I don't think there is an abundance of this kind of horrors. Its recommendable but don't expect anything remotely serious and coherent. With a good spirit you can have a great time with it.

It's mostly just running and screaming though.The story is typical Hollywood fare, but it's more complicated than it should be because Gibson has yet to fully grasp the meaning of the word focus (unless the focus is on Gibson). The first half of the film moves along at an abysmally slow pace, the middle is a hyperkinetic mess of action and cheap drama, and the end is just cheesy. The film is also redundant, very redundant. The Scottish fight, the king and his son fight, the noble and his son fight, the prince and the princess fight, there's too much fighting and it just drags on. There's no method to it either, Gibson just threw the scenes together in whichever order struck him at the moment. The drama, this is supposed to be part drama, is god-awful. Don't even get me started on the historical accuracy of the film, it's like it was written by some fourteen year old told to write a paper on William Wallace. Terrible script, let's move on.The acting, oh God, the acting, Mel Gibson can't act. He just can't, all he does is run around talking with a bad Scottish brogue. In fact everyone has bad Scottish brogues, why not get some real Scottish actors instead of forcing us to have our ears maimed? The other actors aren't bad per say, just obnoxious. They don't have any other mode aside from bombast. Aside from Gibson the worst actor is the kid who plays the Prince. He the stereotypical effeminate homosexual character Hollywood loves to throw around. Remember this is Gibson's world, realism doesn't exist here. His accent is easily the worst.

However that's about it, the battles that are so prized were nothing new. Kurosawa was doing epic battles, and in a much more artistic manner before Gibson came along. The battles are nothing more than jittery camera and screaming. The screaming, there's too much noise pollution here, people won't stop screaming. I've read reviews that have said how artistic the battles are, this isn't art by any stretch of the imagination, it's the cinematic equivalent of schizophrenia.Overall Braveheart is a mess, it's the kind of tripe only Hollywood could make.

most quoted, and misquoted, film of all time. Humphrey Bogart is excellent in this career defining role as bar owner Rick Blaine who has come into possession of two letters of transit which guarantee the holders unhindered passage out of Casablanca. He has these as Ugarte, the man who asked him to look after them, was captured by the Vichy French police before he could get them back. Ugarte had been planning to sell the documents to Victor Laszlo, a Czech nationalist who is fleeing from Nazi occupied Europe to the United States via neutral Portugal. Things are complicated by the fact that Laszlo's wife Ilsa had a relationship with Rick before the fall of Paris and he never really got over her.Right up until the end we don't know what Rick will do, perhaps he will let Victor and Ilsa have the letters, perhaps he will let Victor have them on condition that Ilsa stays with him or perhaps he will betray Victor and leave Casablanca himself with Ilsa. Bogart isn't the only great performance; Ingrid Bergman is fantastic as Ilsa, there is a real chemistry between her and Bogart, Claude Rains is great as the French policeman who's loyalty is likely to change depending on who he thinks is likely to be the most use to him and Paul Henreid's restrained performance as Victor Laszlo is faultless too.It is hard to say what genre this film is, it is one of the great romances, it is also a war film, a thriller and even has some subtle comedy moments. Don't be put off by the film's age, the fact that it is in black and white or that it has a U certificate, this film is a must see.

So, seeing a version set in New York circa 2000 seemed like an interesting (if not questionable) choice. And for me it works for the most part. While I'm sure Shakespeare purists would cry foul, and maybe rightly so, the simple fact of the matter is that Shakespeare needs some new fans and the best way to grab a younger audience is to present it in a way that doesn't seem antiquated. So long as that's done with respect to the source material, I see no problem with that.The only real problem I have with this version is some of the casting choices. Obviously the script is the same as about any other version and only the setting and time period change...but Bill Murray as Polonius? Not that I don't like Bill Murray, but I've never seen him doing Shakespeare (and still don't, really). Steve Zahn as Rosencranz? Seriously? I thought Ethan Hawke would totally bomb the performance, but he did well enough. And Liev Schrieber as Laertes was surprisingly good...especially given the last thing I saw him doing was playing Sabertooth opposite Hugh Jackman. Not exactly high quality material.All in all this isn't a fantastic adaptation of what is arguably Shakespeare's most popular work, but it's definitely a good effort and a bit of a shot in the arm for what many people believe is an outdated style of writing. I've never really understood that...just because you need a moment to process the meaning of something doesn't mean it's bad. It just means you're using your brain.

Sure, it may not be as good as 'Dawn of the Dead', but it's still a zombie movie, and a good one too.What the movie really needed was some gore.There was a little blood, but I love to see a movie with people being torn apart by zombies.Lucky for me, the 3rd film managed to fix that problem.Bottom line 'Resident Evil' is a good zombie film with a terrific performance by Mila Jovovich.The sequels are better, in my opinion.

It's about the struggle of teens for freedom & the difficulty parents have letting go of their children.The film centers around a town, which led by its preacher (Lithgow) has banned dancing, music & alcohol. The more the town represses the teens, the more they seem to want to rebel & Ren (Bacon), an outsider becomes their leader.Most people like this movie because of Kevin Bacon & the great soundtrack. But there's also god acting from Lori Singer & others. It's a great film that will leave you feeling good.
