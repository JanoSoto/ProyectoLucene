I strongly advise that anyone who watches this movie must be mature enough to do so, because the cruel reality of drugs and its effects on the lives of people in this film were something that even I ,an adult, was not fully prepared for. Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly, Jared Leto, and Ellen Burstyn put on amazing performances that in my opinion are almost impossible for them to top. The cinematography, screenplay, and the portrayal of what life is like when one depends on drugs could not have been done better.

I failed your mother.If this is the kind of cute exchange that gets you all mushy-gushy, then dig in. After all, SOMEONE must have been created to enjoy this pathetic pap. This scene was also meant to be funny - but in a SWEET way. Please, someone... make space, I gotta rush to the loo... MFM is one of those tear-jerker comedies, the worst sub-genre there is. Predictably, nothing here is funny, nothing is cute, and the only tears that left my little head were the huge drops that formed themselves under my eyes as I repeatedly yawned, wondering if something of quality would EVER pass by the screen. In the end, as Sobieski sobbed for a record 48th time, I broke wind and that was pretty much the highest quality - of anything - that came anywhere near my TV set during that not-so-fateful viewing.My First Mister, with a title that is just as embarrassing to read as much of the dialog here is embarrassing\/unbearable to listen to, is a desperate cross between Hollywood formula schmaltz, French generation-gap sex-romp male fantasy, plus a small amount of that supposedly deep indie movie genre with the unsuccessful touches of quirkiness-for-the-sake-of-it that usually go along with that sort of thing. MFM takes the worst elements of these anyway mostly bad genres, and serves you a product you can't real eat to. MFM is something to vomit to, hence if you wanna prepare a meal to accompany this film, you'd better count on that food leaving your body just as soon as you swallow it. MFM is NOT a quirky indie movie by any means. It is predictable, totally unoriginal sweetititity nonsense, full of overly melodramatic, sentimental plot-devices such as a TV-movie-of-the-week sudden fatal disease outbreak. Fat Al is dying, people, so let's all get those tissues! And guess what else he is too noble too take advantage of a 17 year-old that comes on to him OUT OF THE BLUE. Yeah, I guess MFM was meant to target lonely middle-aged housewives who are trying to waste time between two Amanda Quick novels, but also middle-aged men who have just entered a midlife crisis hence are starting to have dreams about young and willing teenage girls... Brooks is also so very predictably brave about dying - aren't we all?? Those Tinseltown weepers and their perpetually brave dying characters... I'm touched. I would have given this movie four more stars if only Brooks had screamed I don't wanna die!!!! at the top of his lungs. A bit more realism hence unpredictability, please.One of the many annoying aspects is that for most of the movie all the side-characters are cardboard caricatures. McKean is wasted as a tight-a** suit-and-tie guy, Kane plays an overly ditsy and manic mother, Goodman is the dumb aging hippie, etc... None of them have any credibility, hence are neither funny nor real - or at the very least belong to a different kind of comedy than this, perhaps a screwball comedy. It is as though these absurd characters invaded the set of MFM by leaving the set of a very bad sitcom. (But that'd be like leaving one sinking ship for another.) The lesser, one-appearance-only, characters are even dumber the woman that rents out apartments is swayed by the most ridiculous story Brooks cooks up (hence totally unfunny); Sobieski sells a suit to a store customer who also acts like an utter imbecile, and so on. This movie does justice to no-one in its cast except perhaps Brooks, who is anyway an overrated, unfunny slob. He belongs in this dull turd. At times I had a feeling as if Brooks was trying to walk in Robin Williams's footsteps, when he played all those terrible, totally pathetic pity-me-please-weep-for-me-please characters. Goodman, on the other hand, is wasted, making a fool of himself as Leelee's free-spirit father. Talk about moronic casting... Leelee plays a know-it-all (i.e. dumb) Gruftie (Goth chick) kid with suicidal tendencies. She is spoiled, she is confused, arrogant-yet-insecure, and we are supposed to like her. Worse yet, the makers of MFM are so out-of-touch with music fashions that Sobieski listens not to Type O Negative, Danzig, or the Smashing Pumpkins, but some ultra-commercial chewing-gum pop which she proudly presents to Brooks in of the movie's many cretinous scenes. In spite of its glaring flaws, the first 15-20 minutes were at least semi-watchable. However, as time passes it becomes quite apparent that the script has nowhere to go. It was obvious the two would not have sex, hence much of the middle is about dull, supposedly insightful conversations between the fat loser and the black-nail-polish brat. And then came the disease, the lost son, the dying\/hospital scenes, the unavoidable death, the inevitable crush between Leelee and the son there were gallons of tears dripping all over the furniture while soppy Hollywood violins doodled in the background... You get the picture.When I found out that the actress Christine Lahti directed this junk I wasn't really surprised 1) what I really wanna do is direct is a disease that nearly every thespian catches nowadays, and 2) Lahti is one of those actresses that you've seen weep a 1000 times in about as many movies...
