What could be made of it? Furthermore, the premise is neutral either a very good film could be made or a very bad one. Well, this isn't at all very good, and if it isn't very bad, it came damn well close. Only big bucks Hollywood production values and a couple of big name actors prevented that.

Almost from the start I had decided what kind of film I thought it would be, but before sitting down to write these comments, I decided to skim through a few of the other reviews. And they only confirmed my worst fears. One said if you like this sort of film, watch it. Another recommended it highly to all Julia Roberts' fans. Fair enough. But if you enjoy good, intelligent, witty, truly romantic, funny and poignant films, I recommend you give this one a miss. I don't mean to get heavy, but, oddly, anyone IN the US who is puzzled as to why many, many people OUSIDE the US should regard Yankee narcissism as increasingly insufferable should spend a little time simply analysing My Best Friend's Wedding. It seems to encapsulate what is, to us non-US people, so offensive about that, in many other ways, admirable country. Apart from the Dead Hand Of Hollywood, which feels obliged to drown in sugar and schmaltz anything and everything that moves (the potentially very witty scene of Rupert Everett singing Say A Little Prayer is killed stone dead by the film insisting in that very American way of going way over the top &#151; quite probably the American producer's insistence overcoming the Australian director's good taste), we have a very, very curious morality. For example, this film is shot through with the idea that 'to confess it to be forgiven'. I've confessed, so I am absolved, and to hell with any consequences. This film has the good grace to make Julia Roberts character finally admit that she behaved like a semi-psychopath, but even then that confession is wrapped in pseudo-romantic humour which implies 'Aw, shucks, well that's OK then.' Then there is that peculiarly American - and thoroughly dishonest - trait of insisting 'we're all very basic and unpretentious at heart (the comparison by Roberts between creme brulee - Kim - and jello - her) while all the time exhibiting that odd and revealing American dog-in-the-manger worship and admiration for Big Money, Wealth, Prosperity. One problem of this film is that it begins to take one particular tack, then abandons it. Kim's choice of Julianne as her maid of honour in order to keep a beady eye on a love rival was quite a promising theme. But by pay day All Is Forgiven. Oh, yeah? Aslk a few women, while they are in their cups, if it really works that way. Then there was the Greek chorus of (two sisters? Cousins?), bitchy Southern belles both. They were very promising material, but for no particular reason are redeemed in the penultimate scene when they sing The Way You Look Tonight. The final judgment of this film is looks good - Hollywood has a buck or ten to hire extras etc. - and tastes good if you like jello and sugar, but it is far too dishonest to be in any way worthwhile.

I think everyone should read his books (even his Physics lectures, even if you hate Physics. He makes everything worthwhile). Onto the film... The film starts out with the sweet, gentle relationship between father and son, taking direct quotes from Feynman's own novels (he actually didn't write them; they are accounted stories) Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman! and What Do YOU Care What Other People Think? and letters and such. It progresses through Richard's days in high school, to meeting Arline (that is the correct spelling) onto MIT and Princeton (pre Los Alamos). During this, my biggest complaint would be that the film moved way too fast. There were some lines (Look I'm gorgeous) that were just beginning to show Feynman's character and his way with humour, but it plowed right through them onto the next scene. I think Broderick was so intent on keeping everything to the book, he forgot some very vital elements of what made Richard Feynman Richard Feynman. What really grasped Feynman's character was when the film steered into the direction of Feynman's days at Los Alamos (working on the bomb) and Arline was at the sanatorium. The film showed just how much fun Arline had with Feynman and vice versa (I loved that the film included Feynman's birthday present from Arline!). It also showed the tenderness, yet sometimes almost absent love of Feynman. In Perfectly Reasonable Deviations from the Beaten Tack the letters of Richard Feynman, he writes a letter to Arline before she dies telling her how he wished he would have been there for her more, loved her more, etc. I think the film really captures that, even before the book was published, Broderick had a sense of what Feynman was going through. He didn't really know how to handle his wife dying. Lastly, I loved how they implement Feynman's love of drumming. It really didn't become an obsession until much later (when he went to Brazil after Arline's death), but the film shows the beginnings of a love that Feynman would love until his death (a number of his friends joked that he was going to spend his Nobel earnings on a new bongo drum). There were flashes of the Feynman people know and love, but it didn't really hold true at the beginning. One thing that seemed confusing was a brief snipet involving Broderick as Feynman hearing about a baby. This is most likely in reference to a pregnancy scare that took place when Arline was in the sanatorium. They thought they'd have to abort the baby, but it turned out she was pregnant and that she was just malnourished because of her illness. They didn't explain that very well though.

This, of course, was long before it was required reading in some schools.But I wrote THAT review back in 1998 on another website.-ANYWAY!- This new version may be okay to those watching the movie for the first time, but ...Once upon a time, there was a silent film called Metropolis, which was quite interesting, last I remember.It was RUINED when it was re-released in the 1980's by having a bunch of 1980's pop music placed over the original score and soundtrack. Although I dig the song Radio Ga-Ga by Queen, IT DOES NOT BELONG IN A 1930's SILENT MOVIE!! (Nor did any other song, for that matter)Once upon another time, there was a movie about the late Hunter S. Thompson (Lord rest his soul) called Where the Buffalo Roam, which you can only find on DVD now with a horrible 80's and\/or 90's soundtrack dubbed over the original, even though (last I remember) the whole movie took place in the early to middle 1970's. (Of course, you might find the good version on E-bay)I hardly want to remind anyone about George Lucas' desecration of his own Star Wars Saga with such annoyances as Jar-Jar Binks, the new band in Jabba the Hutt's Palace, the Little Shop of Horrors Plant in the Sarlaac Pit, etcetera, and so on, ad nauseam.-SO ........-Now we have the Special Edition of The Outsiders.The book, of course, hasn't changed and the movie now has all the scenes that were supposed to be in it the first time back in.It also has all sorts of documentaries and commentaries. One of the commentaries is by Francis Ford Coppola and the other is by C. Thomas Howell (Ponyboy), Ralph Macchio (Johnny), Patrick Swayze (Darrel\/Darry), and Diane Lane (Sherry\/Cherry).However, the special features, extra scenes back in (making it a bit closer to the book), and the commentaries are as far as the goodness goes ...The original movie had only a few old hit songs here and there and a good orchestral score that punctuated the scenes properly ...WHEN MUSIC OF ANY KIND WAS NEEDED.Now, with the Special Edition DVD, very little (if any) of the orchestral score is still in; most of the new movie has been drowned by random Late-50's\/Early 60's pop songs even in parts that didn't need music to punctuate it in the first place.Every moment that had feeling (or was at least supposed to have feeling) is suddenly Trivialized by yet another pulp pop-song-of-the-time coming on even when A) the scene wasn't supposed to have music, B) even if the said scene did require music, the original score actually set the scene's mood while the pulp pop-song seems to be just thrown in for the sake of having a pop-song in it.If you're new to watching this movie, or if you saw it long ago and don't remember the original score, then, by all means, GET THIS MOVIE! It's One of the Greatest Stories Ever Told.However, if you know the original version like you know your own face (as I do), then stick with the book, watch the 1983 version (so the book will always be better) and only RENT the New Version.I say this as a warning, even though I spent almost an entire weekend watching this over and over, ...GETTING USED TO THE NEW SCORE!Aaaannnnnnnnd ...

This movie has it all. It has this amazing story which depicts the lives and hardships the African American Soilders go through in the War of the states, or more commonly known as the Civil War. The story goes even further though, and breaks down the racial and class structures of that time and how each of every color and stature co-exist together within the same regiment.The acting i superb. Mathew Brodrick does a great job at this role as Col. Robert Gould Shaw, considering the fact that he is still pretty young at this stage of his career and hasn't had the experience like other actors that could of had that role. Denzel Wahington's performance was great as well...and IO believe he even won an academy award for his role as Pvt.Trip in Glory. He always does a wonderful job and I wouldn't of picked another actor to do it. My favorite acting in that movie was Matthew Brodrick, but I think Morgan Freeman did an incredible job as well. As Morgan Freeman as my favorite actor, I might be going over my head and crediting him to much in this role, but I just think he was great. Although his lines in the movie are short of length compared to the other roles, he does a great job at what he was given to do. His presence and feelings you get when you watch him speak really makes you think he is part of that time period and he isn't Morgan Freeman the actor, but rather Sgt. Maj. John Rawlins. Cary Ewles (also in Robinhood and men and tights and The Princess Bride) also was not disappointing. His loyal feelings towards the Union and to Col. Robert Shaw are really brought to life with his acting. He is a very solid actor in my opinion.The Directing of Edward Zwick is genius. Every time I watch this movie I always get the feeling like I'm actually watching a live recording of the Civil War. His angles, sets, and location decisions were outstanding I must say. The way he portrayed the life of African Americans and their struggle for freedom and equality is life like and thought provoking to the last. The fact that this movie is based on a true story makes me appreciate this movie even more and I never get tired of watching it.the writing and screen play was wonderful as well. The main story, the true historical background, and the addition of some individual outside problems are what makes this story connect and make it a solid story. The screenplay and dialogue are both well put together. The slang, dialogue, and presence people used back then are used affective and used to a great advantage to help this movie become a classic. There seems to be not one cheesy or unnecessary piece of dialogue through out the whole movie and that said the dialogue is smooth throughout the entire film. The characters emotions, and actions are predictable enough to say that they are life like, but unpredictable the same, which helps the film not become too dull or too predicable.James Horner's Original score for the movie was wonderful. The choice to have a classical score for this movie was the right way to go. It brought the mood and tone together in this movie and it also helped us, well me at least, appreciate war a little more with its sad tone and gave the movie a more of a professionally made edge to it as well.

The story goes even further though, and breaks down the racial and class structures of that time and how each of every color and stature co-exist together within the same regiment.The acting i superb. Mathew Brodrick does a great job at this role as Col.

Denzel Wahington's performance was great as well...and IO believe he even won an academy award for his role as Pvt.Trip in Glory. He always does a wonderful job and I wouldn't of picked another actor to do it. My favorite acting in that movie was Matthew Brodrick, but I think Morgan Freeman did an incredible job as well. As Morgan Freeman as my favorite actor, I might be going over my head and crediting him to much in this role, but I just think he was great. Although his lines in the movie are short of length compared to the other roles, he does a great job at what he was given to do. His presence and feelings you get when you watch him speak really makes you think he is part of that time period and he isn't Morgan Freeman the actor, but rather Sgt. Maj. John Rawlins. Cary Ewles (also in Robinhood and men and tights and The Princess Bride) also was not disappointing. His loyal feelings towards the Union and to Col.

It shows a rural, pastoral, unsophisticated life in the farm. Second was the magical land of Oz.The backdrop paintings in the film made it look like a fairy tale movie. It has indeed appeared like a storybook with all other aspects working such as colors, costumes and props. It was like a fairytale that audiences of all ages had come to love.The costumes of the characters, from Dorothy down to the munchkins were all beautiful. Even the makeup of the characters was effective.Having also learned what the cast and crew had to go through in filming this movie, one can't help but admire the outcome of the movie. Their efforts were really worth it now that after 66 years, the movie is considered one of the greatest film ever made and the number one movie for families.Having learned that Judy Garland was 16 years old then and had to play 11 or 12 year old Dorothy Gale, it was not at all obvious that she was portraying a younger role. In fact, audiences would think that it would never be the same if someone else played the role.The movie has lots of dancing and singing, which is good since they kept the audiences' attention. Plus the songs are catchy, that after watching the movie you'll find yourself singing the songs.At the beginning of the movie, the color was sepia tone and actually not black and white. The sepia tone was used to emphasize the kind of atmosphere that Dorothy was living in, a dull, rustic, unsophisticated life at the farm.In the land of Oz, everything was colorful. One would think that he\/she is watching an animated movie or a cartoon for that matter.The movie showed recurring shots of roads, both in Kansas and in Oz. They symbolized the journey that Dorothy would undertake in her transition from a child to a more mature person.The Wizard of Oz is a wonderful movie made beautifully and colorfully. At first I thought it was a children's flick but the way the narrative was carefully made got me enjoying the film. It got the kid in me singing, learning and understanding that I don't have to look far because the home is where the heart is.It is a kind of movie that would make you smile after watching it and you would think of the many times you wanted to get away (or even plan) from home.

That one kid did that to her. That is basically the plot.Most of the movie plays like a documentary. It simply shows a bunch of teenagers bulls***ing about a bunch of nothing. Who cares? Their is no acting here or really even a plot. Most of what the kids say could have been improvised. Please trust me, anybody could have written this. So what else does that leave?--- maybe teenage nudity and sex? something Larry Clark is so known for. Well--I am one hour and ten minutes into the film and so far-- neither.

It is the younger brother who only played college ball while its brother played professional, for lack of a better analogy.The Godfather part 3, at first glance, is just a poor sequel which was meant to appease hardcore fans, make money, and start off some careers. Yet, if you really look at the 'summary' of all the Godfather conflicts that were put into this movie, you will see that it is just as artistic as the first two.Michael is a hero. A hero whose life ends in tragedy. His fatal flaw is the ability to understand the nature of good versus evil. To elaborate on that further, Michael understands that he must sacrifice his peace and plans for the future to save his family. This of course will take sacrifice, what he fails to understand is, that good conquering evil will always come with a price, and that sometimes it is hard to distinguish the two. That will seal his doom.Michael cannot differentiate between what is right and what is wrong while he doing the right thing. Telling God that he will sin no more if he is let out of the business, then handing the wheel over to a man who he knows will commit great acts of violence, is, I'm afraid to say, committing a sin. He also fails to realize that killing your brother who was just stupid, is probably not gonna look good on God's account. Many other instances of synonymous circumstances occur throughout the movies and I doubt I have to elaborate for anyone who has seen them.Michael fails to see, that after many of his loved ones death, he still did his job well, he saved his family, but doomed himself for not listening. And it is understood in the end that he dies alone, hating God, hating life, hating all that he did for he thinks he failed.All in all, the Godfather 3 is actually a damn good movie, which sums up all of the points the first two did not make emphatically clear.

Yet, if you really look at the 'summary' of all the Godfather conflicts that were put into this movie, you will see that it is just as artistic as the first two.Michael is a hero. A hero whose life ends in tragedy. His fatal flaw is the ability to understand the nature of good versus evil. To elaborate on that further, Michael understands that he must sacrifice his peace and plans for the future to save his family. This of course will take sacrifice, what he fails to understand is, that good conquering evil will always come with a price, and that sometimes it is hard to distinguish the two. That will seal his doom.Michael cannot differentiate between what is right and what is wrong while he doing the right thing. Telling God that he will sin no more if he is let out of the business, then handing the wheel over to a man who he knows will commit great acts of violence, is, I'm afraid to say, committing a sin. He also fails to realize that killing your brother who was just stupid, is probably not gonna look good on God's account. Many other instances of synonymous circumstances occur throughout the movies and I doubt I have to elaborate for anyone who has seen them.Michael fails to see, that after many of his loved ones death, he still did his job well, he saved his family, but doomed himself for not listening. And it is understood in the end that he dies alone, hating God, hating life, hating all that he did for he thinks he failed.All in all, the Godfather 3 is actually a damn good movie, which sums up all of the points the first two did not make emphatically clear. I suggest that if you find this movie to be bad and your a fan of the series , to watch it again and look for all the summaries.

I'm sure some have approached it in what I'm calling the wrong mindset and enjoyed it, but I don't think it's likely for a person to do so. And of course anyone is free to do as he or she wishes with the film, so don't take my words as gospel, anyway.David Mamet has crafted here a film that has truly very little plot and is very easy to see through at every step. However, that's part of the point. The film is an exploration of what it itself is and plays with the conventions of film in general and paranoid thrillers in particular to a hilarious extreme. This takes the form of aphoristic dialogue, obvious clues of future events, and of course the on-the-nose visual motifs that dominate Mamet's direction.Steve Martin is absolutely brilliant in a type of role we've seen from him before and always played well (to explain it would be to give away a plot point) and Campbell Scott puts in a fine, subtle performance in the lead. None of the other actors is required to do much and does what he or she needs to do well. However, acting is just not much of the point of this film--it's all about the narrative.Another important point of this film is that Mamet--known for his profane dialogue elsewhere--manages to make an entire film without swearing. Perhaps it was done to make a point (See how stupid things sound when you don't swear?!) or perhaps it was done just because aphorisms, Shakespeare, Thoreau, and most of the other common sources of the dialogue simply swear little and thus Mamet sort of accidentally went without swearing (I doubt the latter, but it's possible). In either case, there is a purpose to the extremely unnatural dialogue (probably mostly because movies never have realistic dialogue, to be fair) and that is part of the humor of the entire experience.So, all in all, David Mamet has crafted a surprising masterpiece, but it has to be approached in the right way. If you approach it expecting a true thriller, you're probably going to hate it because of its obviousness, the stilted dialogue, and its blatant rehashing of past films. However, if it is approached correctly as a real play on itself, The Spanish Prisoner is an absolutely hilarious film and one of the most intelligent pieces of comedy in history.

He believes that David, being strong and not able to injured, is the opposite of what Elijah is, oh, and he has a weakness, water. The two scenes you can really believe this mythology could be true, are when David asks his son Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark) to keep putting more heavy stuff on exercise weights, and during a fight with a crook. Also starring Forrest Gump's Robin Wright Penn as Audrey Dunn and Charlayne Woodard as Elijah's Mother. This is quite a good film that does not hype the superhero format, and darkens it into a thriller genre. Oh by the way, it was Elijah that caused the train crash, he caused many incidents to find an opposite of him, i.e. someone that would survive. Very good! ","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi"}]
