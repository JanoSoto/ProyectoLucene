It turns out that he has a sharp sense for the humanistic factor.  This movie is about a melancholic lonely detective at a turning point in his life that is retirement when a horrifying child murder occurs in his jurisdiction.  He is the only one who can muster the courage to deliver the news to the parents and from then on he is fixated to this case in spite of retirement.  The mother and the granny have deep emotional effect on him and the former one, in a state of grief, dares him to make a pledge to find the murderer, which he does, like in a trance.  This is somewhat unusual and perhaps unlikely in reality from a experienced detective but it underscored the unusual horror of the case even in the eyes of seen it all professionals.  The weakest performance was perhaps from the mother, since it could have been more dramatic, given the circumstances and the importance of that scene in the movie.  Jack Nicholson's performance in this movie is nothing less than spectacular and he is very convincing as this melancholic, altruistic detective who doesn't have any clear purpose of life after retirement other than to try to fulfill his pledge.  He never uses his famous grin and reveals only a miniature of his joyful side with a subtle wave of a eyebrow in one scene.  His connection to the daughter of Robin Wright Penn's character is very convincing and makes the key relationship in the movie.  The end is simply brilliant although ironic, but sorry, this is how many of real life's mysteries end.  No Hollywood ending here.  Like with so many movies that have a slow humanistic pace this one did not get its proper chance at the box office and it was out of theaters before I could take a turn.  I was disappointed in seeing it as a DVD edition because the Wisconsin scenery is very beautiful.

It's not good, but it's not bad either. Based on the great book by H.G. Wells, this Cliff Notes version (90 minute running time) is a CG-heavy film that doesn't fall into any category because it doesn't have a majority of time spent in any genre. There's a little bit of romance, a little bit of science fiction, and a little bit of adventure, but not enough of either to warrant a categorization.  Guy Pearce (Memento) is OK as the lead character Alexander Hartdegen (though nameless in the book), but he can't really carry the movie. In fact, none of the characters are interesting or likeable enough to really care about too much. Orlando Jones and pop princess Samantha Mumba support, but also don't have a juicy enough role to work with. The only interesting character is Jeremy Irons as the humorously titled villain Uber-Morlock. Unfortunately, he has less than 10 minutes of screen time, though. The real star in the movie is the in the special effects. There are some great sequences during the time travel scenes and the Morlocks look pretty good. Simon Wells (grandson of H.G.) directs, but seems to lose focus. It seems that he was more concerned with the look and feel of the movie rather than the story itself, which is the reason why he got the project. It's a shame that with such a great story that this couldn't have been a better movie. Obviously it came from a great story, so apart from the new effects, there was no reason to mess with the book or even the 1960 classic film version for that matter.

Andy is someone who really hopes to get out but Red is afraid of getting to used to living behind bars.It turns out to be one of the best films ever. People who haven't seen it say Its just a jail film Its not! When they end up watching it they find out its not just a jail film. Another thing its unpredictable which is what you expect when you see a film.Nobody cannot like this film! I could go on forever about the reasons why this film is so good, just watch it. 10 out of 10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"8 March 2002","score":"","review":"  You know, Exorcist fans seem to be divided into two camps either you love this movie or you hate it.

Less talk, more action please, Mr. Blatty.

Or for that matter, even close enough to have had a picture of the two taken? It becomes difficult to build a film based on the relationship between these two men (which, face it, is the core of the story) when it contradicts the mythology Blatty himself put to paper.Speaking of contradictions, hasn't anyone noticed that Father Kanavan WASN'T the priest who gave Karras permission to give Regan's exorcism? Or that Kintry's mother WASN'T the analyst who noticed the curious nature of the McNeil recording? And while we're at it, why does Karras' gravestone state that he died in 1975, two years after the events of the first film? Simple! Because Blatty, for some inexplicable reason, made this story take place FIFTEEN years after the original, despite the fact that all the TV adverts proclaimed that it had been (correctly) SEVENTEEN years! Figure that one out, folks!So...if I remember both the book and first film correctly, didn't we have a VERY lengthy discussion of the fact that the Church needs to give permission for an exorcism, and that this is based upon exhaustive investigation? So answer me this, guys and gals how in the WORLD does Father Morning show up out of the blue like that? Kinderman makes a phone call...and then there's Nicol Williamson, guns blazing, about to make the Devil's Day!

Unintentional humor (come on is the old lady crawling across the ceiling REALLY supposed to be scary?). Painful cameos (Patrick Ewing and Fabio *shudder*).This COULD have been a great movie, but without Friedkin there to tame Blatty's overindulgence as he did with the first film, it fails.

And can't can't get the help he needs because the health care in the US sucks !! His fathers insurance company is a bunch of con's and so is his workplace. Then he decides that he is fed up with the hospital because they say they can't help him out. (maybe if you had some good health care) So like in the schools and post offices the father decides to take over the emergency room with a gun and take people hostage. And for some reason we are all supposed to just give this man what he wants. How about all the other kids that are dying and have no coverage to pay for the hospital bills. What makes this kid so special. Yes it shows how much a father loves his kid and would do anything for him, and yes this kid is special but so is every other kid in the world. The we have Ray Liota the police chief, the type of guy who would do anything just to save his own ass caise it is an election year. He doesn't care about his fellow employees or even the kid dying in the hospital all he cares about is his paycheck and rep. Then Anne Heche everyone is supposed to hate her because she can't help the family out with there son's problem. Well you know she is only doing her job. Bill meyer said it best in the movie (not an exact qoute but close to it)  the only people americans have to blame for bad health care is themselves. I am Canadian and yes the Taxes do suck sometimes.

","genre":"Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"8 March 2002","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  I missed the first several minutes of this movie on television, yet was captured by the realism of the dialogue between Belushi and Woods from the first 30 seconds I saw. The scenes between Belushi and Woods throughout the movie, between Woods and his Salvadoran girlfriend, Woods and John Savage (well playing a photographer), Belushi and Woods and the thugs who inhabit every street corner, are wonderfully written and acted. Woods is his usual wonderful self, Belushi has the best part he's ever had and plays it wonderfully.I have a lot of trouble swallowing this movie. First, it presents a completely hedonistic, and an utterly corrupt society, and a wholly violent society (violent in every relation within families, between strangers on streets, etc.), EXCEPT for dauntless American nuns, brave American aid workers, a valiant but troubled American ambassador, a courageous American photographer, etc. In that sense, and perhaps contrary to Stone's political instincts, one gets the sense that one should never ever visit El Salvador - if you have integrity, are industrious, sober, ascetic, abstemious, you will find it one great slum of people who need instant gratification - whether it is through their pleasure in violence, their pleasure in fornication, their pleasure in drugs, in drunkenness. There are no portrayals of people working steadily toward goals or objectives in any way. There ARE no hard working workers on assembly lines in factories, in management, in fields raising crops, in selling products, in hospitals (a doctor is yelled at for smearing blood all over his smock), in courts, in fire departments, in building construction, in police departments, in airports, in road construction, in advertising, in any area of human endeavor. No one in El Salvador is going home to a house containing one's wife and children at the end of a long honest day at work.Moreover, one takes one's life in one's hands from brigands, thugs, drunken violent people, accosting prostitutes, drug dealers, taunting begging children, on every street corner of the country at all times - not due to any political end - that's just the way THEY are, per this film. If a car exists, it's burning, if women are seen, they're nuns or prostitutes.The movie uttterly changes from its gutter realism to propaganda as soon as Savage and Woods go to the mountains to photograph the rebels. Suddenly, one hears sappy instead of ominous music, sees happy people kissing, sees vigorous hard exercise and training. It's actually rather funny in an Orwellian kind of way. The ensuing scene with Woods and the military attache and State Department analyst is as crude a political discussion as I've ever seen. The movie is at pains to state that there is no connection whatever between the governing communist Sandinistas of Nicaragua (heavily reliant on Cuban and Soviet assistance) and the rebels in neighboring El Salvador who purportedly rely exclusively on rudimentary military equipment captured from the government. The movie hits the point so hard that one wonders whether this is really true - it's certainly counter-intuitive that there would be no military assistance between a neighboring government and friendly rebels who profess identical aims. One problem with the movie is the conflation of the elected Salvadoran government and the civilian death squads, runaway private militias and outlaw government intelligence. The movie is deliberately vague on the distinction between ANYONE in official power (who are actually never shown) and the death squads. They are all shown as one and the same.Well, this simply wasn't true in El Salvador. Obiously, President Napoleon Duarte and his party's members who controlled the government at that time did not head up death squads! In fact it was Duarte whom Colonel Roberto OPPOSED in the election. (Incidentally the colonel, is caricatured as Major Max is shown so evil, so stereotypically a banana republic colonel, his dialogue so badly full of childish bravado - as to be comic. No one would ever follow such a primitive buffoon).This failure to distinguish between the main body of government on the one hand and an alliance of i) out of control elements of that government, and ii) outlaw factions of current and former military men, and iii) civilian death squads, is a serious problem in this movie. One gets the sense from the movie as if the war was the death squads against the rebels.In fact, the struggle there was three-way - a) rebels sought to overthrow a democratically elected government and to install a Sandinista like regime, b) death squads containing some present but mainly former members of the military and intelligence wreaked havoc on left-wing civilians (including the Church) and armed rebels, and c) the democratically elected government, relatively weak in arms, sought to stop the rebellion and to stop the death squads. Stone obviously has great talent in conveying a charged situtation on screen. The images are wonderful, the nervousness, the danger, the realism of the dialogue of people in danger. One just wishes he had more of an intellect - more of a desire to explore and differentiate - instead of hitting one over the head with simplistic (and therefore wrong) portrayals of political events.

The scenes between Belushi and Woods throughout the movie, between Woods and his Salvadoran girlfriend, Woods and John Savage (well playing a photographer), Belushi and Woods and the thugs who inhabit every street corner, are wonderfully written and acted. Woods is his usual wonderful self, Belushi has the best part he's ever had and plays it wonderfully.I have a lot of trouble swallowing this movie. First, it presents a completely hedonistic, and an utterly corrupt society, and a wholly violent society (violent in every relation within families, between strangers on streets, etc.), EXCEPT for dauntless American nuns, brave American aid workers, a valiant but troubled American ambassador, a courageous American photographer, etc. In that sense, and perhaps contrary to Stone's political instincts, one gets the sense that one should never ever visit El Salvador - if you have integrity, are industrious, sober, ascetic, abstemious, you will find it one great slum of people who need instant gratification - whether it is through their pleasure in violence, their pleasure in fornication, their pleasure in drugs, in drunkenness. There are no portrayals of people working steadily toward goals or objectives in any way. There ARE no hard working workers on assembly lines in factories, in management, in fields raising crops, in selling products, in hospitals (a doctor is yelled at for smearing blood all over his smock), in courts, in fire departments, in building construction, in police departments, in airports, in road construction, in advertising, in any area of human endeavor. No one in El Salvador is going home to a house containing one's wife and children at the end of a long honest day at work.Moreover, one takes one's life in one's hands from brigands, thugs, drunken violent people, accosting prostitutes, drug dealers, taunting begging children, on every street corner of the country at all times - not due to any political end - that's just the way THEY are, per this film. If a car exists, it's burning, if women are seen, they're nuns or prostitutes.The movie uttterly changes from its gutter realism to propaganda as soon as Savage and Woods go to the mountains to photograph the rebels. Suddenly, one hears sappy instead of ominous music, sees happy people kissing, sees vigorous hard exercise and training. It's actually rather funny in an Orwellian kind of way. The ensuing scene with Woods and the military attache and State Department analyst is as crude a political discussion as I've ever seen. The movie is at pains to state that there is no connection whatever between the governing communist Sandinistas of Nicaragua (heavily reliant on Cuban and Soviet assistance) and the rebels in neighboring El Salvador who purportedly rely exclusively on rudimentary military equipment captured from the government. The movie hits the point so hard that one wonders whether this is really true - it's certainly counter-intuitive that there would be no military assistance between a neighboring government and friendly rebels who profess identical aims. One problem with the movie is the conflation of the elected Salvadoran government and the civilian death squads, runaway private militias and outlaw government intelligence. The movie is deliberately vague on the distinction between ANYONE in official power (who are actually never shown) and the death squads. They are all shown as one and the same.Well, this simply wasn't true in El Salvador. Obiously, President Napoleon Duarte and his party's members who controlled the government at that time did not head up death squads! In fact it was Duarte whom Colonel Roberto OPPOSED in the election. (Incidentally the colonel, is caricatured as Major Max is shown so evil, so stereotypically a banana republic colonel, his dialogue so badly full of childish bravado - as to be comic. No one would ever follow such a primitive buffoon).This failure to distinguish between the main body of government on the one hand and an alliance of i) out of control elements of that government, and ii) outlaw factions of current and former military men, and iii) civilian death squads, is a serious problem in this movie. One gets the sense from the movie as if the war was the death squads against the rebels.In fact, the struggle there was three-way - a) rebels sought to overthrow a democratically elected government and to install a Sandinista like regime, b) death squads containing some present but mainly former members of the military and intelligence wreaked havoc on left-wing civilians (including the Church) and armed rebels, and c) the democratically elected government, relatively weak in arms, sought to stop the rebellion and to stop the death squads. Stone obviously has great talent in conveying a charged situtation on screen. The images are wonderful, the nervousness, the danger, the realism of the dialogue of people in danger. One just wishes he had more of an intellect - more of a desire to explore and differentiate - instead of hitting one over the head with simplistic (and therefore wrong) portrayals of political events. He can make one squirm, shriek, shake - but not think through anything.

Everytime I vowed not to waste anymore timing watching his garbage, I'd watch another, hoping I'd finally see a good film of his. So two years after it came out, I said ok, I'll give him ONE more chance and rented Bamboozled. What a mistake.The funny thing is, like with most of Lee's films, the premise of Bamboozled is actually quite promising and probably would have worked if only a capable filmmaker was behind it. (However, the fact that the whole country went ballistic when Ted Danson put on blackface that one time doesn't do the premise any good.) The truth is, Lee is a horrible filmmaker and that's why his movies bomb.For whatever reason in the world, Spike Lee still has that pimply-faced know-nothing NYU film student mentality, where he feels if he does a few odd things with the camera and audio and goes for an artsy feel, that it'll be a success. Well, it isn't. It's a big failure. Many of Lee's fans (and maybe Lee himself?) may give that old line of well, you just don't get it or it's over your head or something similar. Well, that's a bunch of crap. There is nothing here to get. Bamboozled is such a hack piece of garbage, it doesn't come across as profound, deep or anything else the typical NYU film student feels he or she is so good at expressing. The movie just plain and simply sucks.Most of the actors are decent enough, although a Wayans in the top role doesn't help either. Damon Wayans is straining so hard to get his part right, it hurts just watching him. Some may say, he's camping it up. Well if he is, he's doing it very poorly.Watching this movie felt like watching some kid from heck, not just NYU, any high school film class who threw a whole bunch of garbage together in the guise of profoundness and deepness. There is no message in Bamboozled no matter how much someone wants to say there is. It appears the only reason this film was made in the first place, was as an excuse to remind the ten people who saw it in the theaters that there were such things as minstrel shows and people performing in blackface.I wonder how many of the few viewers actually even realize that there actually was a real actor dubbed Sleep 'N Eat (more originality by Mr. Lee).But, I'm glad I did finally see this film. Because it was definitely the slap in the face that finally convinced me never again to waste my time viewing any future Spike Lee films.  He has to be the most talentless so-called maker of films out there today.
