TRADING PLACES was a major hit when it was released and it's stayed popular ever since and it's really not too hard to see why. You had two great comics at the top of their game, you had a strong supporting cast including Jamie Lee Curtis as the hooker with a heart of gold and you also had two Hollywood legends in Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche doing terrific work. Of course they're put in the crazy world of John Landis who was also at the very top of his game. The ingredients were simply flawless and when you put everything together it made for one of the best comedies of the decade. No matter how many times you watch the picture there's just no denying that it keeps getting funnier and funnier. While there are some over-the-top and rude moments, I think the reason the film works so well is that it also has a message to say and in this regard it really does seem like a homage to those pictures of Frank Capra. Landis manages to keep the comedy flowing at a very good pace but the film also manages to ask questions about place and how much power is really needed by society. Of course, the main reason the picture works so well is that we've got a terrific cast simply doing wonderful work. Both Murphy and Aykroyd are simply perfect in their parts as they both fit them so well that you really do feel as if you're watching real people. Curtis is as charming as ever and it's easy to see why this picture gave her career a big boost. Both Bellamy and Ameche, two of the most lovable actors in the history of cinema, really manage to play against that image as the evil brothers. You've also got Denholm Elliott, Jim Belushi and Paul Gleason in very good supporting parts. And let us not forget the excellent work by the gorilla in the cage. TRADING PLACES is certainly a comedy that's very confident about itself and it pays off with a great number of laughs.

Tall, suave and well-spoken, able to give dignity to even the poorest script and even the most unlikely scenario. This is really pretty much the same-old, only with a slightly larger budget. Although the gadget budget must be the smallest in the history of Bond, consisting of little beyond a magic power watch.Looking decidedly middle-aged and packing the kind of clothes that nobody under 40 would want to be seen dead in (even then), Moore\/Bond is on the trail of another Mr Evil (twist respected) who wants to mass produce heroin and give it away. Thereby eliminating all competition. Which it might until he started charging for it again, when it would re-appear. Clearly not a serious proposition and Moore doesn't even raise his famous eyebrow to this bizarre school of thought.Looking sexy and baffled is a young (introducing?) Jane Seymour who is best playing strong women with a brain rather than bimbos who can be tricked by tarot cards. Still she is nice to look at, although for reasons not altogether anything to do with common logic she seems besotted by our old-enough-to-be-her-father hero even with his safari suits and tired puns. But such is the lot of most Bond girls.CIA agent Rosie (Gloria Ellis) is so stupid that you wonder if she really is a CIA agent at all. While she is black (and we know that clichés are allowed in 1973) why would they employ a numb skull? Mind you the full CIA is not much better rarely doing anything but put Bond in danger.Boat chases are the worst type of chase because there really isn't anything in the way. You just go very fast and try and outrun the next guy. This seems the budgets biggest expense and we have to watch it with all the excitement of a powerboat DVD we didn't want for Christmas. Things are destroyed and onlookers are shocked, but that is the problem with the series. Driving a car fast was shocking in 1962, by 1973 it is simply nothing to write home about.What really follows is the, now, much laughed about capture-escape-capture-escape which Bond often engaged in. Never asking for back-up or help you wonder whether he is driven by a death-wish. Making the same mistake twice even.Still it has a rocking soundtrack and Moore tries not to laugh at the lines which come tumbling out of his mouth. He gets the job done (with the help of a stuntman or two), but then again we knew that at the start. It really didn't get any better did it for then on in? Same old formula being refitted and retreaded until we were all sick of it and the box office told its own story.In the cold light of day, Moore's Bond was really a nasty user and abuser never mourning much over a death. Even if he caused it. Luckily he never seemed to take himself or the script seriously and that is what saves him.

In fact, if you look at Snipes' career, over the long-haul, the more outlandish his films became, the more his career ebbed.I always liked Wesley Snipes, and thought he could have been one of the most popular of the African-American actors that were coming into their own in the 1990s. I see his performance here as being solid. I can't say the same for Dennis Hopper's performance. The term adequate comes to mind. But not a very imaginative performance.

And, the sub-story of the woman whose life never quite takes off, and she muddles through being a waitress at a hash house, always waiting for the one man who pays attention to her to become what he says he can be; a rather tragic characterization.My one big criticism of this film is the beginning.

These were bizarre drama\/shock flicks starring elderly and most respectable dames in demented roles, such as insane murderers or mad-raving battle-axes. Director\/producer Robert Aldrich should be considered the founding father of this trend and, even though there were several obscure but incredibly entertaining imitations (see below for more than just a handful of recommendations), his Whatever happened to Baby Jane and Hush Hush, Sweet Charlotte are still the only ones that stand as classic efforts nowadays. Aldrich was also responsible for Whatever happened to Aunt Alice, albeit as a producer instead of a director, and perhaps that's the sole reason why it isn't a classic as well. Or perhaps not at all, because Aunt Alice is totally different than Baby Jane and Sweet Charlotte even though certain sources refer to it as the closing part of the trilogy. Geraldine Page amazes as Mrs. Claire Marrable, a totally bonkers widow whose industrialist husband left her nothing but financial debts and a lousy old stamp collection. Since she doesn't want to give up her luxurious and fancy life-style, she decides to slay a series of poor old housekeepers for their savings. Not a very profitable business, if you ask me, because how rich can you possibly get from the money of a bunch of grannies that have to clean houses to survive? But anyway, Mrs. Marrable buries the bodies under pine trees in her Arizona desert garden and gets away with it. That is, until Mrs. aunt Alice Dimmock applies for the vacant housekeeper position. Dimmock (the equally impressive Ruth Gordon) has a hidden agenda, as she undercover wants to find out what happened to her friend Edna Tinsley who mysteriously vanished after working for Mr. Marrable. The big difference with the other Aldrich hag-classics (and simultaneously the main default of this particular film) is that everything solely depends on the dazzling performances of the leading ladies, whereas the other two also feature a sinister atmosphere, dark house settings and black & white cinematography, convoluted plot twists and macabre set pieces. The script doesn't contain any real surprises (except a reasonably good one at the very end) and L.H. Katzin's direction lacks confidence and vision. In spite of some noteworthy sequences, the film honestly isn't that great and only worth seeing for Page and Gordon.As promised, here are some recommendations in case you're interested &#x96; and you really should be &#x96; in seeing more horror hag movies. Following the immense success of Whatever happened to Baby Jane and Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte, the lead actresses obviously became typecast a number of times. Bette Davis appeared in Hammer's The Nanny, while Joan Crawford went much further over-the-top in delicious camp flicks like Strait-Jacket and Berserk. Hammer Studios also produced the shamefully underrated Die! Die, My Darling starring an amazing Tallulah Bankhead. Shelley Winters also became a famous hag thanks to the double feature Whoever Slew Auntie Roo? and What's the Matter with Helen. Last but not least I also warmly recommend a couple of uniquely eccentric titles like The Beast in the Cellar, Frightmare, Homebodies and You'll Like my Mother. Happy hunting!

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"15 March 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" One of the most fun and ingenious temporary trends in horror cinema history undoubtedly were the horror hag movies from approximately the mid-sixties until the early seventies. These were bizarre drama\/shock flicks starring elderly and most respectable dames in demented roles, such as insane murderers or mad-raving battle-axes. Director\/producer Robert Aldrich should be considered the founding father of this trend and, even though there were several obscure but incredibly entertaining imitations (see below for more than just a handful of recommendations), his Whatever happened to Baby Jane and Hush Hush, Sweet Charlotte are still the only ones that stand as classic efforts nowadays. Aldrich was also responsible for Whatever happened to Aunt Alice, albeit as a producer instead of a director, and perhaps that's the sole reason why it isn't a classic as well. Or perhaps not at all, because Aunt Alice is totally different than Baby Jane and Sweet Charlotte even though certain sources refer to it as the closing part of the trilogy. Geraldine Page amazes as Mrs. Claire Marrable, a totally bonkers widow whose industrialist husband left her nothing but financial debts and a lousy old stamp collection. Since she doesn't want to give up her luxurious and fancy life-style, she decides to slay a series of poor old housekeepers for their savings. Not a very profitable business, if you ask me, because how rich can you possibly get from the money of a bunch of grannies that have to clean houses to survive? But anyway, Mrs. Marrable buries the bodies under pine trees in her Arizona desert garden and gets away with it. That is, until Mrs. aunt Alice Dimmock applies for the vacant housekeeper position. Dimmock (the equally impressive Ruth Gordon) has a hidden agenda, as she undercover wants to find out what happened to her friend Edna Tinsley who mysteriously vanished after working for Mr. Marrable. The big difference with the other Aldrich hag-classics (and simultaneously the main default of this particular film) is that everything solely depends on the dazzling performances of the leading ladies, whereas the other two also feature a sinister atmosphere, dark house settings and black & white cinematography, convoluted plot twists and macabre set pieces. The script doesn't contain any real surprises (except a reasonably good one at the very end) and L.H. Katzin's direction lacks confidence and vision. In spite of some noteworthy sequences, the film honestly isn't that great and only worth seeing for Page and Gordon.As promised, here are some recommendations in case you're interested &#x96; and you really should be &#x96; in seeing more horror hag movies. Following the immense success of Whatever happened to Baby Jane and Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte, the lead actresses obviously became typecast a number of times.

Even the title of his review -- Charming fable... -- hits the nail on the head.I think what some other reviewers need to refocus on is what story did Ron Howard decide to tell us? After all, there are many directions this film's basic premise could have gone in. For example, it could have become a science fiction film, but instead, Howard told a story that only depended on a science fiction substrate. The real focus here is actually human life ON EARTH. How do humans react to growing old.What a wonderful ensemble of actors portray a wonderfully interesting group of old codgers. The gem, of course, was the almost forgotten Don Ameche...for my money, one of the most underrated actors in American cinema; what a joy to savor Ameche's acting here, and to rejoice in a career renewed. Wilford Brimley...not a favorite of mine...is just right here. Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy, a real-life married couple that always brought joy and dignity to their roles. Jack Gilford, interesting as always. Gwen Verdon, another mostly forgotten actor who did very nicely here. So how are these old folks going into that good night? There's all variations here...just as there probably would be in real life.The aliens' characters are less well developed. I've never been a fan of Brian Dennehy, but he does nicely here as the leader of the aliens. Tahnee Welch has a decent amount of screen time, but it's a plot device, not the development of a character. Interestingly, Tyrone Power, Jr., son of Tyrone Power, is another of the aliens, but he mostly just stands around looking not as strikingly handsome as his father.The special effects here are pretty decent, especially considering that this was filmed nearly 30 years ago. Some of the special effects impressed me, others did not. But the special effects people did their jobs to help tell the story effectively.I found the ending a bit of a let down. I guess we just had to have faith that the seniors made the right decision to go with the aliens. It would have been nice had Ron Howard done a sequel to tell us the next part of the story. Steve Guttenburg, as the skipper of the yacht, is just kinda left there in the Gulf Of Mexico in a rather difficult legal position. What happened to him? So much more of a story could have been told.But, I'm not complaining. This was and is a satisfying film. A gem. Highly recommended.

Let's start with&#x85; Bane The fact that he was created by some dumb ass scientist instead of coming up with his formula himself was just not comic related in anyway, and was just an abomination of the character. Also the fact they made him into some babbling idiot who can't even say his own name, even though bane is actually a genius was ridiculous. Even making him a person who's only there for breaking down walls and saying only 3 lines throughout the whole movie, I mean his longest sentence was saying the word bomb every 3 seconds over and over again. Being bossed around by Poison Ivy like some little lap dog just would not happen either, we know Bane wouldn't stand for that kind of crapFreeze It occurred to me that people actually liked Schwarzenegger's performance as freeze which is a mystery to me by itself.

Using diamonds to power his suit, come on surely a genius like Victor Fries can think of something less money consuming as diamonds. Batgirl she has 10 minutes on screen as Batgirl and is a completely pointless addition\/character to the movie. Making her Alfred's niece as well.

There are more than a few shots of female nudity with female prisoners in the showers, and the obligatory 'cat fight' with women mixing it up in the pressure-cooker of the prison, along with good scenes of women shooting automatic weapons, everything to make Quinton Tarantino tingle with delight.In a Philippine night club a buxom torch singer Blossom (Pam Grier) works the crowd until her accompanist Django (Sid Haig) whips out a machine gun and the two rob the patrons. When patrons shoot back and Police close in Django narrowly escapes with a beautiful hostage Terry (Anitra Ford) whom he abandons because he touts his criminal actions as a support of a political revolution, and because she is considered the plaything of all the dignitaries of the country and below his respect. Terry is arrested by Police as an accomplice of the robbers and because of her high-profile relationship to government officials she is packed off to a women's prison in the countryside and Django learns from his band of criminals that they plan to overthrow the prison and kidnap the women so they can have happy families. Blossom and Django infiltrate the prison and plan an escape that enables Terry to lead the captive women to freedom but at a high cost.One might argue that without director Jack Hill the actress Pam Grier might never have reached stardom. Hill was on a roll in the early 1970s, starting with Isle of the Snake People, and The Incredible Invasion, both in 1971. He followed with The Big Doll House in 1971 and the break-through for Pam Grier, The Big Bird Cage in 1972. The Blaxploitation hits Coffy (1973), and Foxy Brown (1974) put Grier on the map as the new representative of the black American urban persona that was taking on the rampant crime of the big city and eliminating them for the safety of the innocents living everywhere.The most intentionally humorous moments in the flick, playing the delicate balance between comedy of manners and adventure, come from Sid Haig who clearly gets it. He plays every scene with a wink and a nod to the camera not unlike what Alan Hale used to do on the TV show Gilligan's Island. This lifts the film up from real bathos as the jokes all center on sex and the relationships between men and women.Anitra Ford is the central character in this film despite the fact that Pam Grier gets top billing. This probably because it was basically Grier's vehicle and with her hot looks and her ethnicity she was the selling point for the flick- every male wanted to see this woman in all her voluptuous glory on the big screen.Anitra Ford is the polar opposite of Grier in physical attributes and acting. To say that Ford underplays her part is an understatement &#x96; she is easily the most somnambulistic of actresses, with never any tension in her body or voice. She is ostensibly the sympathetic character in the movie and the one the audience is led to identify with. Ford is NOT an actress and the camera loves her.The Big Bird Cage is definitely one of the purest examples of 70s film genres that pushes the envelope in terms of female nudity. It's no wonder that Tarantino mines the decade for all its banality and kitsch pseudo humor.

My rating may be a bit sentimentally high but still this is really not a bad film and definitely not the worst of the Roger Moore years.8.1 \/ 10--Zoooma, a Kat Pirate Screener ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller"},{"date":"15 March 2014","score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" Both slammed and praised, this James Bond film sure has its mix of user reviews. Personally, it is my favorite owing to the fact I have seen it the most, primarily back when it was on HBO in the 80's (plus two or three times in the past 20 years.) Roger Moore looks old but not too ancient to be pulling off his 7th turn as 007 (and his last.) He actually looked older in Octopussy two years previous.
