I thought it was a great idea to make a movie out of Pink Floyd's album The Wall. I love pink Floyd. They are one of my favorite bands. I love The Wall, I love Dark Side of the Moon. This movie is worth watching for a Pink Floyd fan, especially if they liked The Wall. The story mostly relies on visual aspects, and the songs themselves in the movie. Just about every song from the album is in the movie. There isn't really much dialogue in the film. All of the interactions between the characters is more communicated in the lyrics of the songs. Especially in Comfortably Numb, and In the Flesh. This movie is very interesting. Some of the songs are really personified in this film. They are given new meaning. I think this movie is more of a cult film, than anything. I don't think it has much mainstream appeal. It's very abstract and would probably only appeal to people who like Pink Floyd. I don't even think the viewer would understand it unless they really listened to the wall. I think this movie should be watched by true Pink Floyd fans. A lot of the film is very depressing. Actually the whole movie kind of is. I also had some problems with the animation scenes. The animation during Goodbye Blue Sky was okay, but animation while The Trial was playing was kind of annoying.

I really enjoy the first 3 Jack Ryan films, the 4th not so much because of Ben Affleck and because it's just too out of sync with the previous trilogy. The first 3 are classic political thrillers that do a great job of bringing Tom Clancy's books to the big screen. His vision and Jack Ryan character are for the most part, executed very well on these films. Many have their preferences as the stronger and better of the bunch but I like Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger individually for their own qualities and suspenseful action. I've seen all of the Jack Ryan's on HD DVD, and sure enough, the Blu Ray's are exactly the same. Which is too bad because Paramount didn't do a very good job remastering them and they just don't look nearly as good as they should in hi def. I suspect that many Blu Ray owners will be pretty disappointed with the lack of visual pop that they're hoping for. Each of the Jack Ryan's looks better than the one before it which is typical as newer films upgrade easier to high def. And at least they all look better than their standard def counterparts. The problem is, is that most hi def owners have seen older films than these look better than these. Which brings us to wonder, what went wrong here? Granted, these films are a difficult upgrade as most of the scenes take place inside a submarine, house, office, or outside on overcast days, making it more difficult to provide that 3D pop we're looking for. But there are specks and dirt in the transfers and while I didn't find them in abundance or distracting, I do feel it's inexcusable at this point in the Hi Def's life cycle, especially for these movies. There's no reason for them not to be squeaky clean by now, even if they're going to look a little flat. But they are the best transfers available and the best we'll see until they provide us a proper remastering. But one is due. The audio, well this is finally where these discs pop. And I mean POP!!! We're given some truly thunderous transfers here in Dolby TrueHD. These films sounded good to begin with on standard DVD (especially October) but these new transfers are just incredible. They easily trounce the old ones. The scores, sound effects, gun shots and explosions are absolutely thrilling. This is all moot if you don't have a proper surround system to decode and dish out the TrueHD tracks though. If thats the case, then you may want to consider keeping your standard discs if you have them because the audio is the clear selling point for the upgrade. Despite my dissatisfaction with the flimsy visual upgrades, I'm still satisfied with these discs. I'd recommend them for any Blu Ray (and home theater) owner looking for a worthy upgrade for their favorite Tom Clancy films. Again, I stress you'll be much more impressed by the HD audio here rather than the passable but not demo worthy HD video. I give this set a 4 out of five because even though difficult, I believe if they really wanted to, Paramount could've and should've given these films a better makeover than they got. The powerful audio will help ease the disappointment with the video. Overall, I still recommend them.

The could had easily turned this piece into an ordinary standard haunted house flick but luckily they didn't. For the normal genre standards this is simply one fine and above all also original entry into the '50's horror genre.But yes, the movie is still above all things a real horror flick and it also does have some good scares in it. Due to it's build up and also original approach of the genre, the horror gets made more powerful and it's moments work out better. '50's horror flick aren't exactly known for their subtlety or credibility but this movie does a great job at putting down a convincing movie with a good story and characters to enjoy.It's a movie that is more light and more enjoyable to watch than the average genre attempt from the same era, without loosing any of its strength as an horror.It's of course also true that the movie benefits from the presence of Vincent Price. This horror icon appeared in many movies like this throughout his career, also often portraying the same type of characters. Like always, he's giving away one fine performance in this movie.Some moments in the movie still feel a bit awkward. Some events within the movie simply are just plain unlikely, as are some of the characters responses.

He survived the Holocaust but lost his wife and two children, and his will to live. The movie is unrelenting in its study of the effects that this man's past has on him some twenty years after the war. A viewer should be prepared for an intense experience--as appropriate, the movie is filmed in stark black and white and there is no comic relief.Surprisingly this is one of the first mainstream U.S. movies to deal with issues surrounding the Holocaust, I guess such horrific events take a long time to digest and the immediate response is most naturally to try to forget. I remember Judgement at Nuremberg (1961) as being the fist time I saw graphic images from the Holoaust, like piles of naked bodies being bulldozed into a pit. But this film does not dwell on the Holocaust per se, but rather focuses on the aftereffects on one man.In the opening scene we see the young Sol and his family happily enjoying a picnic in the countryside just before the Nazis show up. The film is inter-cut with brief flashbacks of images from Sol's memory sparked by current happenings, like Jews being stripped of their rings after Sol has dealt with a customer in his pawnshop who wants to pawn a ring, or memories of Jews transported like cattle in trains when he is on the subway. And Sol has not wound up in the most uplifting of work environments, managing a run-down pawn shop in Harlem where every customer comes in with a tale of woe. Sol has suffered so much pain that his response is to shut his emotions down and to try to cut himself off from people. As he says, I have escaped from the emotions. I am safe within myself. It was a good touch for him to be most frequently filmed behind the wire cages of his shop, symbolizing how walled off he had become. People do try to make contact with him, but he rudely rejects them. He has become such a bitter cynic that it was somewhat puzzling to me why anyone would want to be around him at all. As the movie progresses we start to see small cracks in Sol's self-imposed isolation. He shows up at the apartment of a woman social worker who has tried to befriend him and is anguished when he realizes that his shop is but a front for a gay crime boss (Brock Peters in a fine performance) who is running all manner of nefarious businesses. But it is the dramatic scene at the end when Sol understands that he cannot really cut himself off from society. An unintended consequence of his behavior results in a tragedy and he quite literally winds up with blood on his hands. To come away from this movie without being totally depressed you have to hope that Sol, while being permanently scarred by his past, is on his way to reengaging with the world. This is one of Steiger's best performances and, if there was any previous doubt, it proves that he was one of our best actors. He was in his late 30s when this was filmed and was able, through appearance and body movement, to create a totally believable persona of a broken down middle-aged man. The supporting cast is good as well, but it is Stieger who carries the film. I am in the camp that thinks the assertive jazz score was inappropriate and was overly intrusive (maybe director Lumet had been unduly impressed with Breathless). The screenplay is hardly much more than a script for a stage play and it could have been performed effectively with no music whatsoever.One message to take away is to try to be understanding the next time you meet a sour old man and realize that there might be some good reasons why he is what he is. Maybe, as Sol says, he has seen that there is a world different than yours, much different than the people in it are of a another species.

With his bosses thinking he's a mole behind the botched operation, he must somehow prove his innocence and find out what really happened.Based on the old TV spy show by Bruce Geller, this is an enjoyable, handsomely made thriller with a strong cast, exciting locations, some great action scenes and an intriguing if rather familiar premise. What lets it down a bit for me is the script, by David Koepp and Robert Towne. The key thing with this kind of material I reckon is when to reveal who the traitor is. If you do it at the end you have to pad it out. If you do it in the middle - as this does - it can sometimes work very well (Vertigo, L.A. Confidential) but it needs to be very clear and simple. The liability scene is the one where Cruise and Voight go over the failed mission and we're bamboozled by the flashbacks which accompany it - are they Cruise imagining what may have happened, or Voight remembering what did transpire ? The plot has other holes - when do Czerny and Cruise team up ? Is it a coincidence that Reno works for both Cruise and Voight ? Is money really the only rationale for Voight's actions (he's reprising the character Peter Graves played in the TV show, but seems to have had a seismic personality shift in the interim). This is weak scripting, designed to set up big surprise scenes, but which winds up just being confusing. That said however, just about every other aspect of the picture is first rate, and there are at least three cracking suspense sequences of the kind DePalma does so well (the massacre on the banks of the Vltava, the heist at CIA headquarters and the finale on the TGV train). Danny Elfman's music is great and makes inspired use of Lalo Schifrin's much loved theme tune, while Stephen H. Burum's location photography of Prague and London is sensational, a sort of Funeral In Berlin meets To Catch A Thief. Cruise is good in the lead (under some wild makeup work by Rob Bottin), with great sneaky support from heavy hitters like Voight, Reno and Rhames, although the women are kinda dull; Béart is a bit of a cipher, Scott Thomas gets knocked off quickly, and Redgrave is fun but extremely unlikely as some sort of Euro black marketeer dealer. This isn't DePalma's (or even Cruise's) best film by some margin, but it's an entertaining, if occasionally annoying, contemporary action spy thriller. Trivia - Estevez as the gadgetry man is unbilled for some reason; he and Cruise first appeared together in Francis Coppola's The Outsiders thirteen years earlier.
