It is not thr best Shakespeare film, not like Othello, Henry V, Much Ado About Nothing and Hamlet, but it does boast a strong cast and impeccable production values.If I had any criticisms against this Twelfth Night, they would be that as well shot and as interesting as the beginning scene was, part of me found it unnecessary compared to the rest of the film and it didn't add much to the storytelling, and also it did feel a little sugar-coated towards the end.Criticisms aside, this is a very beautiful-looking Twelfth Night, with the luscious photography, autumnal imagery and scenery and colourful, sumptuous costumes. The music is full of memorable tunes that also do well to enhance each scene.Trevor Nunn's direction is excellent, the dialogue is intelligently woven and delivered, the story while condensed still maintains the play's fun and spirit, all the relationships are intact and done convincingly and the pace is smart and snappy.The acting is just great. Toby Stephens deserves credit for breathing life to Orsino, when he could easily have been bland and Imogen Stubbs is radiant.

The opinion I hear most often from professional and amateur film critics alike is that he was not a good actor, that all his films feature Wayne just being himself, with absolutely no originality or versatility in his performances. I am of a different opinion. To my mind, Wayne was, and still is, one of the greatest actors ever. Many of his films are definite classics. Like any other actor or actress, his movies range from being bad to good to excellent, with his performances varying as well. However, in all his films, he was the easygoing gentleman that meant what he said and somebody that nobody - in their right mind - would want to cross. Therefore, he was essentially always the same character, but that was a good thing, and his fans loved him for it. In the time since then, many film critics, both amateur and professional, have finally realized that his acting rates right up there with the best efforts of other classic Hollywood actors and actresses, such as Jimmy Stewart, Gregory Peck, Gary Cooper, Katherine Hepburn, Maureen O'Hara, and Ingrid Bergman.The Alamo relates the efforts of less than 200 combatants - some soldiers, some volunteers - to defend an old mission, known as the Alamo, against General Santa Anna and his Mexican forces. Santa Anna believed Texas should remain part of Mexico, while Texas' citizens, and some others, believed that the territory should become a full-fledged state. Davy Crockett (Wayne) and his fellow Tennessians come to Texas with the sole purpose of getting drunk and having fun, but after Crockett assesses the situation, and is further convinced by such people as Colonel Travis (Laurence Harvey) and Jim Bowie (Richard Widmark), he and his Tennessians agree to join the forces at the Alamo. Their situation is doomed from the beginning - partly because of discord among themselves, but mostly because of the severely overwhelming forces of Santa Anna. But there is also the problem of the Alamo forces creating enough time by holding off Santa Anna so that Sam Houston (Richard Boone) can get his own forces in shape to fight Santa Anna also, except with hopefully much better results. While these efforts of Houston's are noble, it also further causes the Alamo forces to be thought of as expendable and merely a distraction. However, this matters not to the valiant Alamo defenders, because they consider it a supreme honor to defend the old mission, especially considering that some of them aren't even Texans or Mexicans. All of this has been retold many times throughout several adaptations, such as the more recent version with Dennis Quaid and Billy Bob Thornton. I do respect those films and think they are pretty good, but I've always thought the 1960 version of The Alamo is the best, mostly because of Wayne's presence. This particular film is thought of by some critics to be horrible, with others finding it to be pretty good. Well, I am here to tell you that it is a great movie, and one of my all-time favorites. Unfortunately, the film never quite reaches the status of epic, which is what it obviously tries to be. This is only because all of the film's elements do not seamlessly come together, like they should in an epic. As all the film's different characters come together for one common purpose, there is bound to be a clash of wills and determination at some point among them, and that really is the best part about the film - seeing this grand cast react to one another. The conflict between Travis and Bowie is what stands out in particular, with Wayne, as the easygoing everyman Davy Crockett, stuck in the middle. Due to these various relationships between the characters, the film becomes an emotional study of life, freedom, courage, and honor, with the story of the Alamo itself only serving as a setting that further complicates all those emotions. John Wayne starred in and directed The Alamo. His obvious good taste and dedication to the film is exemplified in its cast, production design, location choices, the massive amount of extras hired, amazing action sequences, and dialogue, which is usually very good. Dimitri Tiomkin's musical score is terrific, containing a few cues that I recognized as similar to his score from The Guns of Navarone, as well as the beautiful song The Green Leaves of Summer. Going into the movie - if we know our history - we automatically know the inevitable fate of the Alamo and the characters that defend it in the film. But this is not at all a bad thing, because the characters all have effective backgrounds and are very well acted by the various cast-members. While the events leading up to their actual deaths are suspenseful, engaging, and somewhat graphic at times, they serve as defining moments for their characters. The account of the Alamo is one of great tragedy and loss, but also of great heroism and sacrifice. All these things are perfectly realized in this film, due to the immense effort and dedication put into it by the magnificent actor, John Wayne.Also Recommended STAGECOACH (1939), THE SEARCHERS (1956), RIO BRAVO (1959), TRUE GRIT (1969), THE SHOOTIST (1976) THIS REVIEW IS DEDICATED TO ANYONE, LIVING OR DEAD, INVOLVED WITH THE MAKING OF THE ALAMO (1960).

Maybe it's just that I'm an interested part, as it brought so many memories of years past in Engineering School. Memories of those mockingly teasing exchanges between pals who feel--rightly or wrongly--they are above the commons in intellectual skills. Memories of solemn, stuffed shirt professors; of austere classrooms, of school libraries; of smart board games--in our case chess--of lazing away warm afternoons...Man, it's like being back there again. Of course we were light years from a Nash, but the mood was the same nevertheless and for that I thank Howard. Call me a sucker for nostalgia, but those University bits are worth at least 2 pts. for me.There are so many other things for what to praise ABM that I don't know where to start. For one, the writing is superb; intelligent, compact, all encompassing, not leaving any holes, even if it got me for a while--when I wondered how bad could be the security of a big shot in the U.S. NSA and how could Russian assassins roam freely in the U.S. Now, I'm no a Crowe fan but I got to grant him the best rounded creation of a movie character in quite some time. His Nash may not correspond exactly to the real McCoy but he's as real as your beer loving next door neighbor. Connelly does a great job also. This is the kind of role I love to see her doing. She also provides for what's to me one of ABM's best scenes, when she's goes to the shed to investigate the source of the radio noise. Those deeply concentrated blue ones put real tension on the screen (call me obsessed but I keep picturing her in thrillers, solving murders, escaping assassins). The rest of the cast do respectable jobs; they really look and act their respective parts. Weird thing I found Charles cool and likable until the twist; from then on he gave me the creeps.Now, some people here seem to ignore the difference between Inspired By & Dramatized Version Of. As I didn't see D.V.O. in the credits, we must be here in the first case. That's what I.B. means, that the artist took some licenses for his work. Some also blast ABM because it doesn't portray schizophrenia as it really is, they say. What bothers me about these critics is, they take us for morons willing to swallow whatever crap we are fed, so we always have to be spoon fed the real stuff. I don't happen to have direct knowledge of SF but the way it's shown here looks convincing to me. In any case there are other films that focus more on its clinical side--as I Never Promised You A Rose Garden f.e.--and if I'm truly interested I'll just do the research, but all I care here for is a well written, well acted, well directed piece of cinema and that I got aplenty. The reason why I think some people react negatively to this kind of license is because they take fiction films for something they are not for moral beacons; for providers of life lessons; for sources of Science or History, when they are above all works created to entertain us, stimulating our senses and minds, hopefully giving us access to realities, ideas we may ignore. They are artworks, not Captain's logs or animated Upanishads, and ABM is not different at that. Now, the fact of being a ABM fan doesn't blind me to the fact that the love story comes with a bit too much saccharine, specially during the 3rd act--the devote & loving spouse sacrificing her career & part of her life to care for her man--but I can accept that as the focus here is on Nash and his battle with the illness. Also that people around him--teachers & schoolmates--act rather unrealistically friendly and caring towards him; I don't think you'll see much of that in real life. But this is a feel good flick, so take it or leave it. The pacing is well sustained; there are not boring parts--even if the occasions for that were aplenty--and slow and fast scenes fit perfectly thanks to the director and then to the impeccable editing; to which we must attribute also in good part the fact that we are completely taken aback by the twist. The score makes for very good company, specially helping to set the mood, without getting in the way of the action. In all, maybe not a masterpiece but certainly one to revisit. 8\/10.

Also that people around him--teachers & schoolmates--act rather unrealistically friendly and caring towards him; I don't think you'll see much of that in real life. But this is a feel good flick, so take it or leave it. The pacing is well sustained; there are not boring parts--even if the occasions for that were aplenty--and slow and fast scenes fit perfectly thanks to the director and then to the impeccable editing; to which we must attribute also in good part the fact that we are completely taken aback by the twist. The score makes for very good company, specially helping to set the mood, without getting in the way of the action. In all, maybe not a masterpiece but certainly one to revisit. 8\/10.

Maybe it's just that I'm an interested part, as it brought so many memories of years past in Engineering School. Memories of those mockingly teasing exchanges between pals who feel--rightly or wrongly--they are above the commons in intellectual skills. Memories of solemn, stuffed shirt professors; of austere classrooms, of school libraries; of smart board games--in our case chess--of lazing away warm afternoons...Man, it's like being back there again. Of course we were light years from a Nash, but the mood was the same nevertheless and for that I thank Howard. Call me a sucker for nostalgia, but those University bits are worth at least 2 pts. for me.There are so many other things for what to praise ABM that I don't know where to start. For one, the writing is superb; intelligent, compact, all encompassing, not leaving any holes, even if it got me for a while--when I wondered how bad could be the security of a big shot in the U.S. NSA and how could Russian assassins roam freely in the U.S. Now, I'm no a Crowe fan but I got to grant him the best rounded creation of a movie character in quite some time. His Nash may not correspond exactly to the real McCoy but he's as real as your beer loving next door neighbor. Connelly does a great job also. This is the kind of role I love to see her doing. She also provides for what's to me one of ABM's best scenes, when she's goes to the shed to investigate the source of the radio noise. Those deeply concentrated blue ones put real tension on the screen (call me obsessed but I keep picturing her in thrillers, solving murders, escaping assassins). The rest of the cast do respectable jobs; they really look and act their respective parts. Weird thing I found Charles cool and likable until the twist; from then on he gave me the creeps.Now, some people here seem to ignore the difference between Inspired By & Dramatized Version Of. As I didn't see D.V.O. in the credits, we must be here in the first case. That's what I.B. means, that the artist took some licenses for his work. Some also blast ABM because it doesn't portray schizophrenia as it really is, they say. What bothers me about these critics is, they take us for morons willing to swallow whatever crap we are fed, so we always have to be spoon fed the real stuff. I don't happen to have direct knowledge of SF but the way it's shown here looks convincing to me. In any case there are other films that focus more on its clinical side--as I Never Promised You A Rose Garden f.e.--and if I'm truly interested I'll just do the research, but all I care here for is a well written, well acted, well directed piece of cinema and that I got aplenty. The reason why I think some people react negatively to this kind of license is because they take fiction films for something they are not for moral beacons; for providers of life lessons; for sources of Science or History, when they are above all works created to entertain us, stimulating our senses and minds, hopefully giving us access to realities, ideas we may ignore. They are artworks, not Captain's logs or animated Upanishads, and ABM is not different at that. Now, the fact of being a ABM fan doesn't blind me to the fact that the love story comes with a bit too much saccharine, specially during the 3rd act--the devote & loving spouse sacrificing her career & part of her life to care for her man--but I can accept that as the focus here is on Nash and his battle with the illness.

To begin with, the plot has some big, spectacular scenes for its actors (particularly in the end), but it also seems a bit predictable at times, like Kirkland's love affair and some of the tragedies endured in the prison system. Yet this shortcoming is more than compensated by the fact the characters seem like real human beings who are vibrant and alive , as opposed to actors who are just playing roles. As long as we can believe in the characters and feel what they feel, then the plot has a freshness and a vitality that it would otherwise have lacked. In emphasizing the role of character in making And Justice for All work as a film, I am referring even to the relatively small roles, such as Thomas Waites as Jeff McCullaugh, who is arrested on a false charge and slowly driven crazy while in prison. Robert Christian also delivers a superb and poignant performance as the trans-gender Ralph Agee. Lastly Jeffrey Tambor does a great job playing the defence lawyer Jay Porter who is overworked, stressed, and harbouring a troubled conscience.However, And Justice for All succeeds primarily because of Al Pacino's great work as a character actor. Al Pacino plays Arthur Kirkland as though he was that man. Instead of seeing Al Pacino, we see a defence lawyer who is overworked, impassioned, spontaneous, brilliant and eccentric. However, Al Pacino's achievement goes even beyond that, because what he is conveying through his performance is the psychology of Arthur Kirkland, a man slowly falling to pieces under the strain of tragedy, the incompetence of others and his huge workload.

Fiercely protected by Aurora throughout childhood, Emma runs into resistance from her mother when she marries wishy-washy college teacher Flap (Jeff Daniels). Aurora is even more put out at the prospect of being a grandmother, though she grows a lot fonder of her three grandkids than she does of her son-in-law. Flap proves that Aurora's instincts were on target when he enters into an affair with a student (Kate Charleson). Meanwhile, Emma finds romantic consolation with an unhappily married banker (played by John Lithgow, who registers well in a rare nice guy performance). As for Aurora, she is ardently pursued by her next-door neighbor, boisterous astronaut Garrett Breedlove (Jack Nicholson). After 75 minutes or so of pursuing an episodic, semi-comic plot line, the film abruptly shifts moods when Emma discovers that she has terminal cancer.Debra Winger, Shirley MacLaine, Jack Nicholson, Jeff Daniels, John Lithgow , Huckleberry Fox , Troy Bishop , Danny DeVito , Lisa Hart Carroll , Betty King.Directed by James L.

I was, however, fascinated with Frances McDormand (I forget where I first saw her) at the time when FARGO was released, so I went to see it mostly because of her.When I left the theatre I was sure that McDormand was going to win the Oscar and that the picture would too (I turned out to be right about McDormand; the movie unaccountably lost to the major bore THE English PATIENT). For what I saw that evening was a true original the best combination of tragic drama and uproarious comedy I have ever seen put on film.We begin with Jerry Lundegaard (William H Macy in another of his truly great performances), a nervous, twitchy little man who works at his father-in-law's car dealership. His father-in-law (hissingly played by Harve Presnell) views him with a contempt he does not bother to conceal.Jerry is in some sort of unspecified financial trouble, and an attempt to borrow money from Dad predictably fails, so he comes up with a bizarre plot to have his wife kidnapped to extort the ransom money from the old man.Jerry enlists the help of a couple of ex-cons referred to him by yet another ex-con. Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare), two of the most inept crooks in all of Minnesota, are the help enlisted by Jerry through his mechanic acquaintance Shep Proudfoot (Steven Reevis), who is himself an ex-con.To be brief, things start to fall apart right from the get-go. Father-in-law unexpectedly agrees to the loan he had previously refused, so Jerry makes several abortive attempts to head off the kidnappers, but it is too late. The crime is afoot and Jerry's wife Jean (Kristin Rudrüd) has already been kidnapped. And in the process, the blundering kidnappers murder a pair of witnesses and a State Trooper.Enter Police Chief Marge Gunderson (McDormand).

As she sits up in bed, we see that she is hugely pregnant. Norm, a devoted spouse, won't let her leave without breakfast, which he cooks for her. Then she puts on her gear and waddles out to her patrol car, to find that the battery is dead (Norm, prowler needs a jump!)

This movie is a true original. It is bloody, there is a lot of violence, the two kidnappers are as depraved as they are incompetent, and there is a lot of death. But there are also a LOT of laughs, especially if you happen to be of Scandinavian descent. I grew up with people who talked just like some of the people in this movie, and to hear that cadence again made me giggle like a schoolgirl even when the dialogue was deadly serious.The entire cast is perfection, but at the end of the day this is McDormand's film, and she deservedly won the Oscar for it.

It was a good laugh. When I see this screen adaptation of Othello from half a century earlier, it feels like I'm seeing more or less the same thing. Except it isn't funny.This is one of a number of productions which star and director Orson Welles had trouble getting off the ground. As such it was filmed in bits and pieces, very much on the cheap. Perhaps Welles also had trouble getting permission to film in certain places, as every scene seems incredibly rushed, as if cast and crew were eager to wrap up. And the amount of editing going on suggests that perhaps Welles was using cameras that wouldn't hold more than two feet of film. There's a section of voice-over narration about ten minutes in where there is a cut every two words or so. It looks like a joke.Welles knew what he was doing of course, and there is some kind of method to all this. When Othello makes his first appearance (shortly after the aforementioned voice-over sequence) we do at last get a slightly longer take, which gives an air of power and dignity in contrast to the rush of what went before. But Welles gets the balances wrong. Most of the movie is too fast, too choppy. The actual images are some of the most breathtaking Welles ever shot (and that is saying something), beautifully baroque compositions of shadow and architecture, but a motion picture must be more than a series of pretty pictures.The principle victim of this hurried version of Othello is probably Shakespeare himself. Shakespeare's dialogue, for all its brilliance, can be hard going on an audience at the best of times and it takes skilled interpretation to bring it to life. By condensing the play and rushing the performances, Welles has actually made it more impenetrable. In short, this one is probably only of interest to the Welles fanatics.

And in my opinion this movie definitely deserves a lot of it ! My expectations of this movie were rather high before watching it and it has not disappointed me in the slightest. The acting was absolutely wonderful, the directing superb and the setting just beautiful. The cast were amazingly well chosen and suited to their characters. From the very beginning I was enthralled by the performance of the cast. Most notably the magnificent Mr. Fry !The movie gave a remarkable insight into the impassioned and tumultuous life of Oscar Wilde. Him as a budding writer, him getting married to Constance, his realisation of his homosexuality and eventually his demise as the most famous and renowned writer of late Victorian society. It shows everything and covers the most important details of his life as a famed writer without becoming boring or slow. It is an extremely flowing, fast and easy movie to watch ! The majority of the movie centres around his furious relationship with Lord Alfred Douglas. The movie gives you the impression that from the very moment Oscar met Bosie  he fell for him straight away, which by all accounts is very true. Even though he loved his wife dearly he could not deny his over powering and all consuming love for Bosie. And yes. I believe it was love. Oscar was sincerely devoted to Bosie  and that comes across in the movie. He fell for him like no other ! But in the strict, conventional and Victorian London their relationship and fumble's with other men were to be ostracised and deemed disgraceful. This movie shows the sheer outrage Oscar's affair with Lord Douglas and his dealings with other men . Who were known to be lower class rent boy's. It shows an outstandingly talented yet somewhat self destructive genius persecuted for his lifestyle. When Oscar Wilde (Stephen Fry)is facing small number of years in prison his great friend Robbie Ross gives him the chance up to go abroad and escape the harsh sentencing and public abuse. But no, Oscar refused to go and decided to stay and face the music, so to speak. Not only does this reflect a man of astonishing courage it reflects a man of truth, honesty and nobleness. Another thing I adored about this movie was the significance the makers of the movie put of the conventionality, snobbery and close-mindedness of that time. And they way Oscar Wilde was destined to not only be an individual who wasn't afraid to push boundaries and be daring. But to be a man of exceptional excellence ! Stephen Fry captivated the endearingly flamboyant, bold and imaginative Oscar. Michael Sheen seems to have Robbie Ross down to a T as the more kind, caring and likable of Oscar's lovers and as the movie progresses- friends. They become great friends and it is clearly obvious that Robbie Ross had Oscar's best interests at heart. Of course, he does not approve of the treacherous Bosie ! And neither did any of Oscar Wilde's acquaintances, family and friends. Stephen Fry couldn't have possibly been more convincing as Oscar Wilde. He embodied the very essence of the genius that was Mr Wilde himself. Seeing Stepen Fry play the lovable, vulnerable and affectionate Oscar was spectacular. The best thing I've seen Stepen Fry in yet ! Jude Law was also the perfect choice for the part of the spoilt, devious and manipulative Lord Alfred Douglas. Aka Bosie. Who in certain parts of the film who can't help but feel an ounce of sympathy for. I know, I must be a very empathetic person ! But the fact is that he comes from a rather unstable family with a brutal father who over the years has viciously tormented and verbally abused his son. Oscar Wilde wants to love Bossie  and show him that the beauty of love. Only Mr Douglass is not the most loving individual. The fact that he encouraged Oscar to be indulge in a depraved love life shows that he was a man out for himself. I'm not saying he didn't love Oscar, I'm sure he did but in a very selfish, inconsiderate and mercenary way. As for Oscar he appears to be the complete opposite. He is enchanted and enticed by the youth of Lord Alfred Douglas. It was a pleasant surprise to see how brilliantly Stephen Fry and Jude Law complimented each other's performances. The is a sparkling energy between them both that is delightful to watch and observe. Stephen Fry rained supreme as the loving, gentle and tender Oscar and Jude Law was marvellous as the not so loving or forgiving Lord Alfred Douglas. Micheal Sheen was perfectly suited playing Oscar's great friend Robbie Ross. Tom Wilkinson was fabulous as the spiteful Marquess Of Queensbury. Jennifer Ehle was marvellous at playing Constance Loyld. She captured her introverted, shy and quiet personality wonderfully well. Vanessa Redgrave did the most stunning Irish accent. Her acting was also pretty sharp too as the proud Mother of Oscar. Last but not least- Zoe Wannamaker was grand at playing the honest and interesting Ava Lerverson. I found this movie to be an absolute must see for any literature fan. It's dialogue is terrific and the acting tremendous. Director Brian Gilbert and screen writers did a magnificent job.

The best thing I've seen Stepen Fry in yet ! Jude Law was also the perfect choice for the part of the spoilt, devious and manipulative Lord Alfred Douglas. Aka Bosie. Who in certain parts of the film who can't help but feel an ounce of sympathy for. I know, I must be a very empathetic person ! But the fact is that he comes from a rather unstable family with a brutal father who over the years has viciously tormented and verbally abused his son. Oscar Wilde wants to love Bossie  and show him that the beauty of love. Only Mr Douglass is not the most loving individual. The fact that he encouraged Oscar to be indulge in a depraved love life shows that he was a man out for himself. I'm not saying he didn't love Oscar, I'm sure he did but in a very selfish, inconsiderate and mercenary way. As for Oscar he appears to be the complete opposite. He is enchanted and enticed by the youth of Lord Alfred Douglas. It was a pleasant surprise to see how brilliantly Stephen Fry and Jude Law complimented each other's performances. The is a sparkling energy between them both that is delightful to watch and observe. Stephen Fry rained supreme as the loving, gentle and tender Oscar and Jude Law was marvellous as the not so loving or forgiving Lord Alfred Douglas. Micheal Sheen was perfectly suited playing Oscar's great friend Robbie Ross. Tom Wilkinson was fabulous as the spiteful Marquess Of Queensbury. Jennifer Ehle was marvellous at playing Constance Loyld. She captured her introverted, shy and quiet personality wonderfully well. Vanessa Redgrave did the most stunning Irish accent. Her acting was also pretty sharp too as the proud Mother of Oscar. Last but not least- Zoe Wannamaker was grand at playing the honest and interesting Ava Lerverson. I found this movie to be an absolute must see for any literature fan. It's dialogue is terrific and the acting tremendous. Director Brian Gilbert and screen writers did a magnificent job.

And in my opinion this movie definitely deserves a lot of it ! My expectations of this movie were rather high before watching it and it has not disappointed me in the slightest. The acting was absolutely wonderful, the directing superb and the setting just beautiful. The cast were amazingly well chosen and suited to their characters. From the very beginning I was enthralled by the performance of the cast. Most notably the magnificent Mr. Fry !The movie gave a remarkable insight into the impassioned and tumultuous life of Oscar Wilde. Him as a budding writer, him getting married to Constance, his realisation of his homosexuality and eventually his demise as the most famous and renowned writer of late Victorian society. It shows everything and covers the most important details of his life as a famed writer without becoming boring or slow. It is an extremely flowing, fast and easy movie to watch ! The majority of the movie centres around his furious relationship with Lord Alfred Douglas. The movie gives you the impression that from the very moment Oscar met Bosie  he fell for him straight away, which by all accounts is very true. Even though he loved his wife dearly he could not deny his over powering and all consuming love for Bosie. And yes. I believe it was love. Oscar was sincerely devoted to Bosie  and that comes across in the movie. He fell for him like no other ! But in the strict, conventional and Victorian London their relationship and fumble's with other men were to be ostracised and deemed disgraceful. This movie shows the sheer outrage Oscar's affair with Lord Douglas and his dealings with other men . Who were known to be lower class rent boy's. It shows an outstandingly talented yet somewhat self destructive genius persecuted for his lifestyle. When Oscar Wilde (Stephen Fry)is facing small number of years in prison his great friend Robbie Ross gives him the chance up to go abroad and escape the harsh sentencing and public abuse. But no, Oscar refused to go and decided to stay and face the music, so to speak. Not only does this reflect a man of astonishing courage it reflects a man of truth, honesty and nobleness. Another thing I adored about this movie was the significance the makers of the movie put of the conventionality, snobbery and close-mindedness of that time. And they way Oscar Wilde was destined to not only be an individual who wasn't afraid to push boundaries and be daring. But to be a man of exceptional excellence ! Stephen Fry captivated the endearingly flamboyant, bold and imaginative Oscar. Michael Sheen seems to have Robbie Ross down to a T as the more kind, caring and likable of Oscar's lovers and as the movie progresses- friends. They become great friends and it is clearly obvious that Robbie Ross had Oscar's best interests at heart. Of course, he does not approve of the treacherous Bosie ! And neither did any of Oscar Wilde's acquaintances, family and friends. Stephen Fry couldn't have possibly been more convincing as Oscar Wilde. He embodied the very essence of the genius that was Mr Wilde himself. Seeing Stepen Fry play the lovable, vulnerable and affectionate Oscar was spectacular.

Mars Attacks! is a spoof of 1950's sci-fi movies, poking fun at all their cheese and cliché. It centers around a variety of characters spread out amongst the USA and how they all react and cope with a martian invasion. There's nothing in this film to take seriously and, for what it's worth, I found it to be hilarious and a ridiculous amount of fun, no matter how stupid it can be.Mars Attacks! is, in a way, genius. It is the kind of movie that is designed in such a way that you can't critique it. You can dislike it, or even hate it, but you can't necessarily critique it on any specific element. The reason being is that it spoofs a genre and a time period for that genre, so anything that is cheesy, silly, or stupid can be accredited to the film's spoofing. If a character does something irrational and idiotic, it is spoofing the way characters were in so many of those cheesy 50's flicks. If something totally bizarre and unbelievable happens in the plot, blame it on the genre the film is spoofing. This kind of manipulations practically falls under the category of film treachery, but I have to give the film credit for finding a loophole around any and all imperfections.And as far as imperfections go, Mars Attacks! has a lot of them. It is a ridiculous, absurd, unrealistic, and plot hole ridden film. Half of it makes no sense and the other half we just sort of have to go with. But the brilliant thing is, that's all part of the fun. This film isn't made to take seriously, and neither is it made to be criticized and scrutinized. It is meant to be enjoyed and only aims to be silly and entertaining. Some will see it as an uncreative way to force us to enjoy this movie, I see it as an opportunity to have a great time and numerous laughs.Another thing I have to give Mars Attacks! plenty of props for is production value. The film rounds up an all star cast of characters with everyone from Danny DeVito to Jack Black. It is also just a large scale flick with lots of great actions sequences with plenty of explosions and giant collapsing buildings. The martians themselves are completely CGI. They look cool to me but I'm unsure if the CGI would be considered good or bad for 1996. I would have to go back and compare it to other special effects of the 90's. The film may looks cheesy but, once again, that just goes back to the fact that everything about this film is cheesy because that is what it is spoofing. But when you think about it, a good amount of money and construction went into making this film as exciting and big budget cheesy as possible, and for that I have to commend it.Mars Attacks! isn't what you would call a high quality film, but that doesn't stop it from being pretty damn fun. I couldn't stop myself from laughing at the cheesiness, the irony, and the satire that is littered throughout this film. I see this is a great use of satire, and it is a spoof film that I can actually stand to watch, and that's saying a lot considering my alternatives would be Epic Movie or Vampires Suck.

The film recalls Robert Bresson's Mouchette, but is shot with fierce, angry hand-held camera work, which mirrors Rosetta's own bottled up rage and desperation. One passage, in which the seventeen year old Rosetta is virtually exploited by a company for cheap labour, led to Belgium changing several laws, banning employers from paying teenage workers less than the minimum wage. It's a tiny, condescending, almost insignificant real-life gesture, but the kind of little gestures which keep today's Rosettas alive nevertheless.The film isn't only about Rosetta's daily struggles for survival, but the blind eyed turned toward an entire stratum of society. Rosetta is a member of a socio-economic class which the world refuses to deal with, let alone acknowledge. Like a disease, she finds herself being pushed further and further out.Rosetta is heavily influenced by Bresson's Mouchette, another film which revolved around a marginalised girl who cares for a burdensome mother. And like Bresson, the Dardennes focus on their heroine's own private rituals the taking off of muddy boots, the scrounging for and preparing of food, the tending to an alcoholic mother etc. And all the while, Rosetta's plotting how do I escape this?

However, according to ROTLD, the scenario in Night was based on real events, and when enthused listener Mathews excitedly consents to see proof of this, the trigger for this deliciously droll zombie uprising is set into motion.It's interesting to note that Romero's Day Of The Dead was released the same year as this ersatz entry in the series, if only because the tones of the two films are as diametrically opposed as Ace Ventura Pet Detective and Sophie's Choice. Return may not yield the intellectual rewards that Day aspires to, but it does infuse a healthy dose of levity that is completely absent from Romero's stark and misanthropic (but brilliant, don't get me wrong) entry.Clearly, the FX here can't compete with Tom Savini's indelibly amazing set-pieces in Day Of The Dead, but there are a few gore-drenched scenes in this film whose execution and facetious tone clearly forge part of the blueprint for Peter Jackson's early work. Even when we end up seeing patently unrealistic rubber puppets, the sometimes clunky effects actually serve the movie well, since they heighten the splat-stick sensibility that is the driving force in Return.Zombie purists may be a bit miffed that cardinal rules of the genre are broken, the most blatant deviation being that the ghouls in Return Of The Living Dead can talk. Yet, the classic send more paramedics line alone merits the acceptance of this alteration of the mythos, and since a good chunk of the humor is derived from the auditory skills of the prowling creatures, I will respectfully suggest that if this idea bothers you, you're more than welcome to skip this outing and watch Lucio Fulci's Zombie again instead.Certainly, the film is a tad lopsided and admittedly uses up its best stuff in the first half, but the humorously bleak and effective ending bookends the movie rather nicely. When the end result is a huge smile on your face while the credits roll, it doesn't seem useful to complain about how that smile got there.

His Lestat is a character you want to beat mercilessly with an iron bar, he's so smug and supercilious.
