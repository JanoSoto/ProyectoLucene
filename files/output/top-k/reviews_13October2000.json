I was embarrassed for the actors who appeared in this gut-wrenching, slobbering, emotion-fest.  Both Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connolly are fine actors, and anyone offended by mawkish sentimentality will wince at some of the lines they are made to speak in this in this awful, maudlin, frustrating movie.Billy Crudup plays a super-decent, super-caring, super-sensitive Democratic (of course--just one of this movie's many cliches) Congressional contender. Jennifer Connolly is his lover from some 10 years ago, who he believes has been killed in Chile rescuing people from a despotic regime.  Their affair is told through flashbacks. They have long senstive conversations.  When they fight, they don't really fight--they are both too decent to yell at the other.  They just look hurt, and we *know* that this is a very meaningful non-fight. Naturally, he is a gentle lover; she weeps during sex. Everyone in this movie is terribly earnest, and LOVES to talk about what they're feeling. In other words This is the Über Chick Movie!But then, when Crudup's character is running for office, he begins seeing Connolly...around, sometimes out of the corner of his eye, sometimes everywhere, a flock of her coming at him.  It seems likely...likely that she's alive...or is it his imagination?  We're never given a convincing reason why, if Connolly is still alive, she has been in hiding all these years, or how such a sensitive, decent person could justify doing what she did to him.  If she isn't alive...then ole Fielding is hallucinating and is, therefore, a psychopath, and the whole idea that he could sustain a campaign, let alone get elected, is laughable.There is one remarkably inept scene in which Crudup's character Fielding is eating with Connolly, her church coworkers (two priests), and 4 Chilean nationals they have just rescued.  One of the Chilean women confronts Fielding on his desire to become a politician, condemning him specifically for becoming an American politician, and we--like Fielding--feel the others in the room silently agreeing with her.  Fielding explodes (but decently!), pointing out their hypocrisy, and how, despite the world's finger-pointing at Americans, it is OUR shores they so often wash up on when fleeing the terror of their homelands.  Finally, he declares that he is choking on the collective superiority in this room! It is a good line, and he delivers a great tirade...but everyone (except, perhaps, the Chileans) in this movie is so darn nice, and good and wholesome, that we can't believe for a minute that they can't see Fielding's goodness, too.  So their collective superiority...it just doesn't ring true.In fact, very, very little in this movie rings true.  This is the sort of movie a 14-year-old girl wanting an adult love story might like; it displays precisely that sort of idealized emotional maturity.  Few discerning adults will be able to stomach it.  Even my wife (who is the reason I sat through it) disliked it.

I must admit that I see Fincher, not Tarantino as the young Stanley Kubrick. This is not to imply that I dislike Tarantino - he stands fourth in my list of ten favorite directors, beating Fincher by three places. But Fincher's dark style, his obsession with the darkest areas of society and psychology place him inside the field of the brilliant Kubrick (who takes #1 in my favorite directors list, by the way).But enough on the directors - on to the movie Fight Club. The true best movie of 1999 (not the weak, overblown, pseudo-intelligent movie like American Beauty), it features energetic performances by Brad Pitt, who may yet redeem himself of his pretty boy days (he he did it once with Se7en; now I truly consider him to be a talented actor), and of course, one of the best American actors, and the best of the young American actors, Edward Norton. Norton is still not Pacino or De Niro, but give him time to become 40 - with such great movies in his pack as Primal Fear and American History X, and now this masterpiece, he still has a great future ahead. And last Helena Boham Carter - except Fight Club, I haven't seen a single movie with her, and as I understood it, I haven't missed much. She may not give such an outstanding performance such as Norton or Pitt, but in the role of Marla she while not amazing, but definetely satifying.The movie starts off with an original credits sequence, designed as a brain fly-through (you have to see it to appreciate) and jumps, head first, into what is Fight Club. As of right now, I WARN YOUSPOILERS!!! THE FOLLOWING SECTION OF THE REVIEW IS ONLY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE OR FOR THOSE WHO WOULD SPOIL THE MOVIE FOR THEMSELVES (BIGGEST MISTAKE OF THEIR LIVES, BY THE WAY)I have not read Palahniunk's (I think I mispelled his name, but what the heck) novel, so I will comment on the script. The script does excellent job, especially with those little details that become much more obvious when we learn that Tyler does not exist and is only the fruit of Jack's insanity. For example, once we see, in Jack's revelation scene, how he was fighting himself in the parking lot, we understand such a line as For some reason, I though of my first fight with Tyler in the scene where Jack beats himself up in the boss's office (as he crashes on the cabinet). Or why Marla was upset at Jack when he ignored her at the first scene when she comes to his house.This movie is definetely worth a second view (at least). Of course, this movie is not recommended for those of you who are weak of stomach (don't like to see close-ups of a man gets his face re-organized), or for those who are afraid to discover something new and unpleasant about themselves. I have recommended this movie to all of my friends, to my entire class in fact, and only a few have liked it. Why? Because most are afraid of the dark message this movie gives us. About the necessity of confronting our own demons before they grow to consume us. About our ignorant, blind-at-will, consumer society. About us. About the things we don't want to know.For you worried parents if you are so worried that your child will see blood and gore, then please understand that he must see this movie. The movie that truly will cause him to think about the true essence of blind violence. Trust me on the fact that it is less gory then (pathetic) movies like Scream, simply because of the deep thought that lies behind the bare knuckles.

We've got everything here Action, comedy, plot, insider's jokes, great acting, great directing and amazing visual effects.A few years back, X-men, the 1992 animated series started broadcasting on TV in Israel, and I was hooked since episode one. That's where I know X-men from, I never read the comics. You could imagine my surprise and excitement when I heard they were making a movie! I've waited a long time, and finally, yesterday was the premiere of the movie in Israel. Of course, I went to the premiere. You think I'll wait to see this movie, even one more day, if I don't have to? Waiting for the commercials to finish 10 minutes after the designated starting time, I was full of expectations for the movie of the year, and might I say &#150; it fulfilled all of my expectations.The movie started with the most beautiful computer graphics I have ever seen in my life. 5 seconds into this, and I'm thinking They should make a screen-saver out of this!!!.Not much of the action-part in the beginning of the movie, it's more of the introduction of the characters Magneto, Rogue and Wolverine. There is the introduction of the plot as well, and I'm happy to say this is not one of those plot-less action movies, in style of bang, boom, credits role.Not to worry, though, the action will come. The fight scenes in this film are so great because of two reasons. One, the SCI-FI reality of X-men allows the director to go all out when it comes to what the characters can do. What makes the fights so awesome is the originality of the moves. Sure, you could have a great scene with Sylvester Stallone punching\/kicking a guy. But isn't it way cooler when you see Storm strike her opponent with lightning, or watch Cyclops fry a villain with a laser beam shooting out of his eyes? The second thing that makes the fight scenes breath-taking is that the producers saved no expense with visual effects, without which all the mutant super-powers would not have made it through the screen.Now, what I love most about a movie is it's ability to make me laugh, even while I'm in awe in the face of the effects. The script handled this beautifully, letting each and every one of the Wolverine-Cyclops exchanges be a hysterical comic relief. They talk, I laugh. They look at each other, I laugh. Humor, that's what I like in my men!Which brings me to the actors. All the villains were hate-able, and all the heroes were loveable, but to one exception Rogue. What can I say? I didn't like Rogue one bit. In the animated series Rogue was my favorite character, due to her much adored girl-power. Kick-ass chick with enough puns to go around, it's the Rogue I know and love. Where is she in this movie? She is obviously younger here than in the series, helpless and insecure. The way Anna Paquin acted her out, she reminded me more of Claire Danes than of Superwoman.Have you noticed how James Marsden (Cyclops) had bristles on his cheeks to make him look older. I don't deny it, that babe does have a baby-face look, and it's what I love about him. Too bad he was hidden behind glasses throughout the movie, except for the occasional accident of dropping them and closing his eyes before he fries everything in front of him to the ground. Well, I guess that's just the price we have to pay to see this cutie as Cyclops.Now I have nothing left to say except for my hopes for the sequel (may it come to us as soon as possible) 1. Rogue as an adult, played by someone else. 2. Gambit (my favorite male character) and his explosive cards. I also want him to take immediate interest in Rogue, because they were always my favorite couple. 3. More romance in the Cyclops-Jean Gray-Wolverine triangle. There is definitely much to be explored in that story. 4. Beast would be interesting to see in the movie, where was he in this one? 5. James Marsden, James Marsden, and more James Marsden.

Those two incumbents are Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen) and Senator Jack Hathaway (William Petersen).  Each of the incumbents is viciously investigated but the man who seems to hold the decision in his hands is Chairman Shelly Runyon (played by Gary Oldman).

Runyon is checked when the President in office (Jeff Bridges) nominates Hanson as his candidate. Now if Runyon is to get Hathaway into office he must convince a judiciary committee to strike down the President's nominee. The story continues as these political egos clash resulting in a very smart and interesting array of confrontations.\tI loved the clashing of egos as each political figure began to focus upon their role in this race. I liked how the writer of the film brought each character into the light as a part of what we are. As I sat and watched each character's role evolve I saw fragments of me in each character. I love good scripts that have this knack.  \tSome examples of this are as follows. First off take Joan Allen's history making female incumbent Laine Hanson who displays the grace, steadfast, moralistic and proud part of each of us. Second would be Shelly Runyon's character who displays the power, tact, desperation and vindication in all of us. And finally would be Jack Hathaway who displays the character traits of smug, contentious, abused, nervous and weak. What is interesting is how the script  unveils each of these characters as the movie unfolds. Another interesting angle is the character of the President who is a lot like each one but uses each trait tactfully. I place the President character between Runyon and Hanson.  \tAs each of these traits are explored and classified we have a great summing up of them all in the film's closing monologue. I liked how the speech talked about what is done in the political process and how that process relates to our lives. It doesn't matter who we might have been before but who we are today. \tBy having such detailed characters we obviously will have some amazing performances and that is so true in the performances of Gary Oldman and Joan Allen. What I liked alot was how the director never lets any of the actors get to melodramatic or over-emotional in any particular scene. When emotion is displayed it was subtle and made a huge impact on a character's evolution. Just two slowly descending tears can stun an audience. That is magic. \tJoan Allen's portrayal of incumbent Laine Hanson deserves an Oscar nod because of how much we can relate to her in that role. Laine Hanson is Allen and this gifted actress immersed herself in this character. The couple scenes where you know she is being verbally undressed and it is that struggle that we see inside her character that is magical. It maybe a very subtle emotion that she displays but it encompasses her character.\tGary Oldman, who plays the devilish Shelly Runyon, has played a lot of vicious characters before but with Runyon he creates a new dimension on these characters.

Previously filmed by Paramount as An American Tragedy in 1931 starring Phillips Holmes (1907-1942), Sylvia Sidney and Frances Dee in the Clift, Shelley Winters and Elizabeth Taylor roles, directed by Josef Von Sternberg, the plot deals with a young but restless man with poverty upbringing who wants to rise above it all. He first comes across a poor working girl, but decides he could do a whole lot better when he meets a beautiful rich gal instead, but he later finds that he cannot get rid of Girl # 1 because she is pregnant with his child. What to do? He puts her to permanent rest so he be free to marry society girl. Was it all worth it? No, because young man gets nothing in return except an arrest, trial and prison sentence for his trouble. I've been fortunate to have seen both screen versions to the Dreiser story on TV and find director George Stevens' 1951 remake an improvement, in fact, an excellent movie. In the original movie, Sylvia Sidney was, to me, more believable and better suited for her role as the poor doomed girl than Shelley Winters in the remake mainly because Sidney appeared more fragile and naive. As for Holmes, he was just not leading man material, which explains why he didn't succeed as one in the 1930s. Within a few years, Holmes would gradually get smaller parts, and after he appeared in some lackluster productions, his career came to an end by 1938. Montgomery Clift (1920-1966), however, proved to be a better suited for this particular part, and like Holmes, death came too soon. The character names here have been changed from the book and original movie. The courtroom scene, with Raymond Burr as the lawyer, is overacted at best but at the same time quite tense. This was probably Burr's run through performance before he would score in the Perry Mason TV series for nine years on CBS. While this production may not be a happy movie, A Place in the Sun, running a little over two hours, does not disappoint. This is the first Clift and Taylor teaming, and the young but thin Shelley Winters' performance is not to be overlooked here either. Look for Anne Revere (1903-1990) as Clift's mother. Sadly, her scenes were severely cut due to her being blacklisted during those black days of the McCarthy-Communist scare. If anyone wants to see how good an actress Revere can be, watch her Academy Award winning supporting role in National Velvet (MGM, 1944), also featuring Liz Taylor.

First off this film gets a 9 out 10. It is a breakthrough film.This film has it all, both good and bad points but the best thing I can say about it is that it is scary, it has great suspense and the characters are real which heightened the realism of the movie.The bad.Degradation of women, we hear hit that bitch in one scene. However to its defense this is what sets it apart from hollywood films. Degradation and exploitation of women in the movies during the 70's was taking place but it was kept inside the closets. This movie exposes that.The good. Great shots of skeleton on a wall. Sick humor moments as when Sally is locked up in the truck of that sadistic gas man and is constantly being poked and whacked by him for sheer pleasure.The good and the bad. 2nd half of the film is really what's disgusting ,yet amazingly real. Real in that these kinda of sick individuals do exist in society from serial killers who committed cannabilism toward others;There is a story behind the skin lamp shades shown in the movie as Tobe Hooper pointed in the Independent Film Channel , he was told a story when he was 7 or 8 yrs old about some individual who bought some lamp shades that were made with human skin, this undoubtly shook him and he used this in the movie.The villains in this movie wont get any lifetime acting achievement awards. Their roles in this movie are sick and in many times youd wish they die since their roles involve getting pleasure from torturing Sally.The best character in the movie is not Leatherface (although Gunnar Hansen undoubtly lays the foundation for a chainsaw killer) but Franklin (the wheelchair bound guy) who you feel sorry for, because even his so called friends mistreat him and this where I did get some satisfaction in the film because Leatherface gets rid of them.Best scene in the film? The end of course when we Sally escaping . By the end of the film Sally is so crazy from being tortured that she laughs in leatherface's face when she gets away. This was the best part of the film because it show that this girl's spirit wasnt broken and she wins the war with Leatherface.Great horror movie. P.S.

Why not run with his whole story for the film instead of summing it up in about five minutes.The angle about the group of frustrated idiots running after a bigger idiot to seek vengeance is the saddest excuse for a comedy this critic has seen in a long time. Couldn't they have played a more interesting angle. Then when the mob of idiots sent out to hunt down Leon bursts into song I so wanted to run for the exits. That wasn't funny but just plainly bad. That whole scene will remind me again and again why musicals have never made a comeback.For me the saddest moment in this film was the cameo by Julianne Moore. Moore is a great actress and one of my favorites. Why did she decide to play a horny clown of all things? I almost cried when I saw that. Poor, poor Julianne.Why exactly would a successful woman like Julie fall for such a loser? Why are all the people in this film complete idiots? And why would an audience pay to see this guy?

Now as we enter into the 21st Century, Director Robert Altman returns this time in DR. T & THE WOMEN. Instead of this film being set in Korea, Nashville, Hollywood, San Fernando Valley, and even Sweethaven; DR. T is set in the wealthy class life of Dallas, Texas.     Richard Gere plays Dr. Sullivan Travis, a popular Dallas gynecologist who is either wanted or desired.  His daughter Dee Dee (Kate Hudson) is about to get married, while his other daughter Connie (Tara Reid) is paranoid and skeptic on her sister's upcoming marriage.  While Dr. T's wife, Kate (Farrah Fawcett) is a mentally ill wife who is sent to a asylum after running around naked in a water fountain at a shopping mall. Kate's sister, Peggy (Laura Dern) a alcoholic is going through a divorce and moves in with her sister's family, and brings along her three little girls.  While some of the people at Dr. T's office want him sexually. They include one of his regular patients Dorothy (Jenine Turner) who keeps visiting the doctor, although there is nothing wrong with her, and seduces him after the examination.  And there's also Dr. T's secretary Carolyn (Shelly Long) who keeps flirting with Dr. T, if she isn't taming the crowded waiting room full of patients.  The life of Dr. T is miserable and depressing, but it's a pro golfer named Bree (Helen Hunt) who helps Dr. T rediscovers the fruits of life.  That life doesn't consist of money, wealth, and sex.  But that life is fun, and that a good loving relationship has communication just as much as sex.      Like all of Altman's other films, DR. T isn't much on plot, it concentrates more on character's personality more than anything else.  And DR. T, is another Altman film that is rich in character's and not much on plot.  But also like Altman's other films, Dr. T, does have symbolism throughout the film that most film viewers wouldn't understand.     However, I am a Altman fan, and I did enjoy DR. T, but it isn't a classic like M*A*S*H*, NASHVILLE, and SHORT CUTS.  DR. T does have great acting, great characters, great dialogue, and great camera and editing scenes (including the opening scene at the waiting room, Altman pulls off another THE PLAYER opening continuous shot).  But unlike NASHVILLE and SHORT CUTS which are both around three hours, DR. T's pacing is a bit slower, and it's a hour shorter than those films.    The acting in this film is obviously good (Altman is a actor's director, he favors ad libbing).  Richard Gere is at one of his better roles as the stressed out doctor who finds sanctuary at the golf course with Bree.  Helen Hunt is also enjoyable as the different and more humane Bree, the only woman in the film who isn't selfish, stuck-up, and doesn't have a Texan accent.  Both Tara Reid and Kate Hudson are good as the spoiled daughters who have two different personalities.  Reid seeing almost everything a conspiracy, and Hudson a girl who is seeking true happiness.  Laura Dern is funny as the ditzy sister-in-law who drinks as much as she can whenever she can.  Dern's character reminded me of the Jane Curtin character in Altman's other film O.C. STIGGS.  And Shelly Long also provides laughs as the love stricken secretary of Dr. T, who is too afraid to admit her true feelings towards him.      But like I said, this is another Altman film, it's a character film.  If you want to see a film rich in plot, then see THE CONTENDER and ALMOST FAMOUS.  But a film with rich characters and personalities, then Dr. T, is the film.  I did enjoy the artistic and visionary style of Altman in this film.  I was however disappointed in it's pacing.  And this is a film that has quite a bit of nudity.  At times I was surprised that this film got a 'R' rating.  And similar to Paul Thomas Anderson's 1997 classic BOOGIE NIGHTS, the final scene in DR. T, is quite shocking to see.  But the nudity is quite strong in this film, that author Craig Hosoda who writes the popular book The Bare Facts will be busy putting more entries in because of this film.  I did enjoy DR. T, and if you're a Robert Altman fan, you will too.  As for those expecting another PRETTY WOMAN or RUNAWAY BRIDE; or if you're a non-Altman fan, you're better off watching something else.  **** (out of five) ","genre":null},{"date":"13 October 2000","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"     It's hard to believe that twenty-five years ago Robert Altman's classi NASHVILLE was released, and it's even harder to believe that thirty years ago, M*A*S*H* Altman's most popular film was released.

Not only is this movie slow-paced, shallow, PC, and about 30 minutes too long, it also had to have some of the worst acting I have ever witnessed...well, with the possible exception of Jade.Eastwood and his posse spend the entire movie chasing after a criminal in a trailer and glugging coffee. And of course the sniper from the government just HAS to be a jerk. Costner is an average actor who gets by on his looks, and would never play a real bad guy. The bad guy he plays here is about as dangerous and offensive as my last bowel movement, which isn't saying much.And Laura Dern...this woman not only looks like a collie, but she seems to have to let out a shrill collie-like scream in every movie she's in, like Jurassic Pork.

The way she played the character, the face expressions, the emotions, fear, passion, hatred, enthusiasm, awe, I sure owe her an apology.Anyway, the scenery is fantastic, the other actors also did a great job, the fights were incredible (a less-gore version of Saving Private Ryan combined with all the awe and emotions of Braveheart). I bet it would have looked amazing at the cinema.I also liked the focus on the inner thoughts and visions of Joan, e.g. when near the end of the movie she is left wondering if it was for God, or for her self she was making the war. The inner struggle within Joan is amazing, the not-knowing-for-sure what she is doing and the I-am-waiting-for-a-sign-now attitude was a pleasant addition to the character's development, and boy was it worth it! Also, concerning the character, I thought it was a great move in the beginning of the movie to delay the appearance of the adult Joan (M.Jovovich). Shades here and there, a black cape on, to cover her by now mysterious face and accentuate the anxiety of the viewer to see what has become of the little girl Joan.Overall, although it hasn't made me weep like Braveheart had, it still holds its ground steady, right below Braveheart, and it would take a hell of a movie to pull this baby down from the 2nd place in epics.

Then there are those who will oppose. What is sad is that in modern times there are the people who oppose who will do whatever they can to prevent that politican to be elected.  In the new political thriller THE CONTENDER, that is what the story is, but it's also a story of kicking someone when they are already down on the groung. President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges) has left the country guessing on who will replace the former vice-president who passed away a few weeks eariler.  Most politicans and news reporters speculate that the nominee will be Governer Jack Hathaway (William L. Petersen).  But President Evans surprises the nation by nominating Ohio Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen). A majority of the women in the U.S. are excited that finally a female is in a high political position.  And the male democrats are also pleased because of her political viewpoints.  However, there are some male politicans who are not happy to see Senator Hanson take the Vice President chair, espcially Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman) who is in charge of a committee who must confirm Senator Hanson's appointment.  Shelly enlists a young congressman, Reginald Webster (Christian Slater) to investigate the past history of Senator Hanson, particularly the scandals. While President Evans has his two aids, Kermin Newman (Sam Elliott) and Jerry Tolliver (Saul Rubinek) work around and try to respond to the scandals of Hanson's past so she can still get the public support and the nomination. THE CONTENDER is a film with little action, and it's mostly dialogue scenes for over two hours.  Yet, this two hour film will grab onto the viewer's attention for it's film length, making the time go by very very very fast.  I was hooked onto this film from the opening scene, and the next thing I realize, the film was already over!  This political movie, like the Oliver Stone classic JFK, went by so quickly because the subject and characters are so fascinating that you think this was a documentary. This is one brillant masterpiece film that deals with politics that it will be ranked among MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, and THE CANDIDATE.  It is more political fact than fiction, yet this is a story that was written for the screen.  The message of this movie is, although you do not agree with the political viewpoints of a candidate, should you do whatever you can to destroy them?  Including publicize that candidate's personal past that will humiliate and emotionally scar that person forever.  And bring out to the public a past that one would like to forget, to that one's family, friends, fellow workers, and the population of the world.  THE CONTENDER asks the viewer those questions, and also asks the viewer, if you were that person being investigated what could you do? I was really amazed on how much of a excellent thriller THE CONTENDER was.  The acting by it's cast also made the film more realistic and exciting.  Joan Allen is fantastic as the role of the Senator who is the victim of this sexual witchhunt.  I thought Julia Roberts in ERIN BROCKOVICH was a shoe-in for Best Actress.  But she might lose due to the performance given by Joan Allen, and I personally would like to see Allen get the Oscar. Gary Oldman is at his villainous best in this film.  Unlike his villian roles in BRHAM STROKER'S DRACULA and AIR FORCE ONE, his role of Shelly Runyon is cruel and vicious as he not only wants to knock down a opponent but also destory the opponent's life forever.  Oldman plays Runyon calm and cool, but his words and actions are similar to a madman.  Jeff Bridges is also excellent as the president who despite his candidate's past, still believes that his nominee is worthy of the title and stands by his belief. Sam Elliott is great as well as the political aid who is frustrated by the information that Runyon is releasing to the public, and is trying to either cover up or debate the scandal issues being brought up.  And Christian Slater is at his best as the young and ambitious political congressman who will do whatever he can to get into a higher office, yet is blinded by his own ambition. Director\/writer Rod Lurie does a marvelous job with this film, by creating a story that would have appeared to be based on a true story, but it isn't.  Although it does have similar echoes to the President Clinton\/Monica Lewensky scandal two years ago.  And Lurie's pacing of this film is fast and captivating.  Lurie along with Cameron Crowe deserves a nomination for Best Director, but he deserves to win a Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.  His screenplay is so brilliant, his character's have extraordinary discussions between each other.  My favorite's where the lunch scene between Allen and Oldman.  And the White House gallery scene between Bridges and Slater. Along with the other fantastic films that Dreamworks SKG has released this year, GLADIATOR, CHICKEN RUN, and ALMOST FAMOUS; THE CONTENDER proves that Dreamworks is the studio of the 21st Century.  I am pleased that Steven Spielberg is seeing Dreamworks as a studio who releases fantastic films, and not just popcorn fluff.

But frankly, I don't care, because The Dish as a movie is a splendid experience.Being heavily promoted as from the makers of 'The Castle'  may get a few extra punters in the door - particularly here in Australia where the exploits of the Working Dog team are rightly well known and loved; but those expecting The Castle 2 will be in for a surprise.But a pleasant one.  This film is much more ambitious, much larger in scope. As is to be expected, the writing here is very sharp - a likeable group of characters are defined very well very quickly, the simple plot flows smoothly, and there is a constant stream of funny (and some downright hilarious) moments.  Much of the humour is distinctly Aussie, and much of it arises from the culture clash between the locals and the visiting Americans. Yet despite this, the film does not stoop to the level of Ocker cliché which plagues several other Australian films.  There is a core of simple humanity here which makes it very engaging.  It is for this reason also that I think the film will play very well in other countries.The cast is also very impressive, from the habitually sound Sam Neill, who projects an immense dignity, and Patrick Warburton as the pressured NASA official sent to oversee the operation, right down to the Mayor's son, reeling off technical details of the spacecraft to his bemused dad.  It is a credit to the cast, and to Rob Sitch as a director that I was rarely aware that I was watching a film, I was simply drawn into the experience.Those, like me, who wanted to be an Astronaut when they were little, and maintained an interest in the space program, will enjoy seeing the famous footage again in a new light.  Those looking for a comedy will find many laughs herein.  Those curious to understand the nature of being Australian will find some clues.  And those just looking for a film to make them feel good could do much much worse.  In short, The Dish is one of those rare movies which will appeal to pretty much everyone.

But frankly, I don't care, because The Dish as a movie is a splendid experience.Being heavily promoted as from the makers of 'The Castle'  may get a few extra punters in the door - particularly here in Australia where the exploits of the Working Dog team are rightly well known and loved; but those expecting The Castle 2 will be in for a surprise.But a pleasant one.  This film is much more ambitious, much larger in scope. As is to be expected, the writing here is very sharp - a likeable group of characters are defined very well very quickly, the simple plot flows smoothly, and there is a constant stream of funny (and some downright hilarious) moments.  Much of the humour is distinctly Aussie, and much of it arises from the culture clash between the locals and the visiting Americans. Yet despite this, the film does not stoop to the level of Ocker cliché which plagues several other Australian films.  There is a core of simple humanity here which makes it very engaging.  It is for this reason also that I think the film will play very well in other countries.The cast is also very impressive, from the habitually sound Sam Neill, who projects an immense dignity, and Patrick Warburton as the pressured NASA official sent to oversee the operation, right down to the Mayor's son, reeling off technical details of the spacecraft to his bemused dad.  It is a credit to the cast, and to Rob Sitch as a director that I was rarely aware that I was watching a film, I was simply drawn into the experience.Those, like me, who wanted to be an Astronaut when they were little, and maintained an interest in the space program, will enjoy seeing the famous footage again in a new light.  Those looking for a comedy will find many laughs herein.  Those curious to understand the nature of being Australian will find some clues.  And those just looking for a film to make them feel good could do much much worse.  In short, The Dish is one of those rare movies which will appeal to pretty much everyone.

I ask, where does it lose that 1.8 points?  It's perfect, my favorite movie of all time.  If I had to guess why some wouldn't like it, I suppose it could be because Bruce doesn't match the live shark footage in the film. Or maybe people prefer a CGI shark?  I'm stumped.  See Deep Blue Sea if you want that, and you'll see that CGI sharks don't make a movie.  Besides, Bruce looks great in 90% of the shots, especially when he rises up under Brody during the last stand.  I've often wondered- why is it that as the years go by and technology advances, the sharks in the Jaws movies just look worse and worse?Everybody has seen this, so to summarize the plot is a waste of time.  No other movie has terrified the world in such a way.  The most terrifying films of all time don't get into your head like this.  There are few people who are afraid of hotels due to the Shining, and even fewer fear demonic possession (Exorcist), or Zombies (NOTLD).  Now these are among the scariest films ever made and I love them dearly, but they don't get to you like Jaws. I've heard that in the past some people feared the shower after seeing Psycho, but come on, Jaws kept MILLIONS away from the beaches, and people still fear the ocean to this day.  That is true, irrational FEAR, spanning 25 years, especially since it is rather common knowledge that sharks are about as interested in eating people as they are logs.  This movie had the same effect on cinema as War of the Worlds did on radio.  It showed that the entire nation can be profoundly affected by what is on that screen.So see this masterpiece again, and for heaven's sake, DON'T watch it on TV. The edited pan and scan version just doesn't cut it, and you don't even get to see what happens to Quint. As for my feelings about the DVD, I really enjoyed some of the new sounds, but overall the original is still the best.  It doesn't matter though, only people who've seen this film hundreds of times like me will notice the new sounds anyway.
