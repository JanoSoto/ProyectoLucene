I don't think the screenwriters ever meant to make a movie strictly about gambling. Rather, gambling, like boxing in Raging Bull, is the world the characters happen to live in. This movie is about the two philosophies every human being chooses between in life whether they're aware of it or not.Edward Norton and John Turturro's characters represented the two philosophies Matt Damon's character was conflicted between. Turturro represented the philosophy that it's better to grind out a living and live a nice safe life, get a comfortable job, buy a house and pay your mortgage and get an equally boring wife who takes out her frustrations in life on you and tries to suppress and kill who you are as does your entire life; your job, your kids, your debt, the obligations you signed up for and from which it is hard to escape.Edward Norton represented never getting comfortable and never sprouting roots and always shooting for the moon and not denying who you are and getting rid of anyone who doesn't care about you enough to accept you as you are which is what any woman who tries to change her man is doing. It makes me think of Leaving Las Vegas where Nicolas Cage's character, even though he was an alcoholic and he was talking to his prostitute love interest, talked about how he accepted himself and her for who they are, which is not to say he didn't care or that he was indifferent but merely that he was at peace with it.As despicable as Norton's character was he was true to himself and he loved Damon's character, he knew who he was and he wasn't always just looking out for himself when he tried to get him back to gambling. There was always this glimmer in Norton's eye that suggested he knew what he was talking about and knew that Damon's character was a card player and knew he was suppressing who he was. Norton's character was trying to help Damon's character's true self break through all the nonsense and fears he was clouded by.The end was the movie arriving at the conclusion that it's better to shoot for the moon and be who you are. Anyone who's got a passion should watch this movie. Damon winning at the end is a positive sort of note to end it on but who knows how many people shot for the moon and missed. Maybe it would have been better to show him lose but nonetheless be content and nonetheless keep at it.Someone said, Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss you'll land among the stars. I don't think this quote makes a lick of sense. You're probably gonna land in a vacuum and let's hope you don't end up near a star or you're gonna get sucked in and burned to death. Most people who fail don't end up in some better position in life because of it, they'd probably be in a better position had they played it safe in terms of their standing and wellbeing.However they do learn from their mistakes and grow and many of the greatest people in the world failed in many ways before succeeding such as The Beatles getting turned down for a record deal and Abe Lincoln being defeated in multiple elections and Michael Jordan being fired from his high school basketball team. These are just some examples but The Beatles are the most successful and critically adored band ever, Lincoln is one of the most revered leaders in all of history and Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.If we make the stars contentment at being true to yourself and symbolic of growing not just as a person but also at whatever it is you have chosen to do in life, that quote could be the tag line for Rounders.
