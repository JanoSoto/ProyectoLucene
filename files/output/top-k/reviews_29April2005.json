See that the movie is someone ELSE'S vision of the book. With that in mind, I enjoyed the movie very much. I thought Brad Pitt was absolutely beautiful, and Tom Cruise was surprisingly good (okay it CAN be difficult to leave ALL prejudice behind). My favorite Claudia scenes in the movie were the ones where she was the most vicious, and I felt that Kirstin Dunst played them EXCEPTIONALLY well, despite the fact that she was a good six years older than her character was written to be.Having said all this, the fact is, none of those three came close to MY vision of the book's characters. And the only character that I simply could NOT accept, despite his immeasurable appeal, was Antonio Banderas as Armand. HELLO?! Armand was all of SEVENTEEN when he was made?! Don't get me wrong, I adore Antonio, but this casting was WAY off. And that long straight black hair?! Santino, MAYBE, but NEVER Armand.Now, for the question I have for you. Who is your dream cast for this movie? I saw a similar thread here, but with only one exception, it seemed that mostly it was a discussion of the cast of this movie. So for those who were not satisfied with this cast, please share your dream cast with me. The actors need not be current - you can cast a young Cary Grant as somebody if you like. Personally, I'd love to see six year old Drew Barrymore play Claudia (or even Shirley Temple with blond hair - could she pull of the meanness and maturity?). Or if you prefer, pretend you are casting the movie today and make it all current, age-appropriate actors (though I reject the default Dakota Fanning as Claudia, as not beautiful enough - Dakota is a gorgeous little girl with an incredibly expressive face and WOW talent, but not the ironically angel-faced Claudia for me).Unfortunately, I ask this of you because I do not have the gift of doing it myself. I must say, the one person that previously posted a list of their own had an inspired choice for Lestat in Paul Bettany. I would never have thought of him. One part of me wants to say that he is not beautiful enough to be my Lestat, but on the other hand, the planes of his face and his ability to play intensely override that. The same person mentioned Johnathan Rhys Davies as another Lestat option. Though I find him incredibly beautiful, for me, he is too androgynous and pretty to be Lestat, though I can totally see where you are coming from.As many of you Anne Rice fans know, her image of Lestat was one of a young Rutger Hauer. That seems a little incongruous with her description of his generous mouth, but she is the author, what can we say? My image of him in my teen years (in the eighties) was a combination of Julian Sands and Sting. Now, I envision him more masculine and sensuous than either.As for Louis, I imagine him more spare than Brad Pitt - more slender, more angular, and with darker hair.And again, Armand is SEVENTEEN, with curly, auburn hair and for me, a somewhat cherubic face, with a slightly Asian cast, as you would find in those of Russian origin. By that I mean high, angular cheekbones and almond eyes. The Russian influence is new to my perception, after recently re-reading Blood and Gold.And please don't feel limited to the cast of Interview. Any other characters from the Chronicles are also up for discussion. I once saw a great web-page by a girl who had some VERY interesting ideas.

As several others have commented, the film is simply too mean-spirited in its comedy, especially when it purports at the beginning to be a true story.The best example I can think of, is the scene in the movie when the wife is tied up inside a sack and the kidnappers are trying to get her into the cabin. She momentarily gets away from them, and runs around in a panicked frenzy, blindly bumping into things, while the kidnappers laugh at her. Believe it or not, in the movie this scene is played for laughs. The movie wants the audience to laugh at this scene, and inevitably some do laugh. Laughing puts the viewer into the same frame of reference as the kidnappers, instead of identifying (as they should) with the victim. As a result, you laugh without thinking, and then feel bad about having just laughed. A very uncomfortable feeling.Most Coen brothers movies are filled with quirky characters that have a lot of heart. Even the bad guys end up being somewhat likable. In Fargo however, there are very few likable characters. Marge Gunderson is just about the only one, and even she is really too much of a cartoon caricature to feel like a real person.

But to categorize this film as drama, suspense or action really does violence to it. This is just a great film, and it doesn't fit comfortably into any category with which I am aware. Don't look here for any sense of fantasy-justice or n'er-do-wrong comic book heroism. Look here instead for gut wrenching nihilism, frustration with the unfairness of criminal justice in the hands of bureaucracy, and a solid, plot-driven story about a couple of cops who are just trying to do their jobs as best they can.And by all means, don't watch this film if you aren't fully awake and willing to be taken down the electric, ambiguous, and compelling roads it leads to. If you watch this film with any part of your brain turned off you'll end up asking questions like plot, what plot? The fact that some people can't find it reflects more on them as film-watchers than it does on this film. This film does not offer passive entertainment like most of the contemporary action market does. It makes you pay attention, though, at times you might not want to. Hackman and Scheider are incredible, with some of the greatest chemistry I have ever seen between two young actors. They play two hard-ass NYC detectives looking to end the war on drugs more-or-less permanently by taking down an international conspiracy which they have just barely sniffed out. And make no mistake, they, particularly Hackman's Popeye Doyle are at war, and treat their jobs as a battlefield. Doyle pursues his quarry with utterly wreckless abandon, endangering the lives of dozens of people along the way. While both men are absolutely terrific, this stands out as one of Hackman's greatest performances, and his Oscar is well-deserved (not something you will see me say often). Backed by a strong supporting cast, and some of the best live-action cinematography of the late 20th century, this film does not allow you to turn away, get popcorn, or even deal with bodily functions for its entire duration.Considered in the early 70s to be 'shockingly violent', this film does not even reach a tenth the degree of passive violent repulsion of the average Tarantino film, and it relies, instead, on amazing performances, flawless direction, a phenomenal post-modern soundtrack and edgy, tense camera-work. Unlike contemporary action film garbage, it also gives you complex characters who you can care about, but never fully understand.

To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two Godfather films, The Conversation, and Apocalypse Now) and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (Peggy Sue Got Married, Bram Stoker's Dracula, the third Godfather) earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before Jack there was The Godfather. While I feel the whole Godfather trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.And don't get me wrong these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think The Conversation and Apocalypse Now are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire Godfather trilogy combined.Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. The Godfather doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, The Godfather offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1\/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again.

It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. The Godfather doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, The Godfather offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1\/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again.

This movie makes no sense. I am sure it has something to do with art, but it beats the hell out of me what.The movie is about a young Chinese woman named Nagiko, played by Vivian Wu (Joy Luck Club) who has had calligraphy painted on her body since she was a little girl. As she gets older she keeps looking for more calligraphers so she can continue to be painted on and have sex with some of them. She meets Jerome, Ewan McGregor (Star Wars I, II, and III) and she has a thing with him where we get to see his schlong in all of its glory. There is some kind of homo erotic thing with a Japanese editor but don't know why he is there or what his purpose is but hey, whatever.Um, I guess the writer and director, Peter Greenaway, has some reason for putting this book onto film. If you ask me, it's so that he can have Vivian Wu and Ewan McGregor nude for most of the film. While that sounds like a good idea, its not. There appears to be no other point to this movie, what do nude bodies look like with paint on them and what does it mean? Peter Greenaway has written and directed two of the worst movies ever put on film, The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover, and this movie, all though for different reasons. First, there is no story other than the garbage I have tried to explain. Second, Greenaway edits the film where there is a picture within a picture scene, I guess so he can double the torture that he is giving you. Third, the sound editing is horrible. The beginning of the movie has a Buddhist chant but it is so loud that birds outside my window were collapsing from the pain. Then he goes into the movie and everybody is speaking almost at a whisper. Then he switches scenes and the music is so loud that the human body is forced into the fetal position until the noise stops. I am sure he made his choices for a reason, but to the layman, it doesn't make work.This is just a horrible movie and I am amazed that people look at it and like it. Greenaway should never be allowed to touch film and he in fact should be a canvas, but the paint should be honey and he should have to lie in the middle of a desert with army ants eating him alive for this movie.

Everyone's always raving about Peter Sellers; yes, he's very funny also, but in my opinion Scott is the best of the entire cast and manages to evoke more laughs than anyone else. He's also the one whose actions are responsible for the film's best line, and most famous. (I'm not even going to mention it again!) Stanley Kubrick's war classic still holds up to this day thanks to its hugely clever script and absurdly prescient aspects of warfare and politics. This movie still holds up over 40 years later and that's saying quite a lot, especially in a day and age when most people look back on films from the 1960s and frown because they were largely known for being optimistic, colorized and starring clean-cut wholesome leading stars who don't recognize a world outside their own sickeningly sweet borders.Kubrick was always way ahead of his times and if Dr. Strangelove were made today it would still be considered edgy in some ways. It touches on certain areas of politics that, particularly right now, are fragile and easily upset.On top of that the not-so-subtle sexual allegories must have slipped by the censors. The opening credits begin with phallus-shaped missiles that are a clear metaphor; they are also linked to the subject of battle which creates a sexual fetish regarding warfare. On top of that there is the General with his cigar and the precious bodily fluids. The sexual symbolism has been written about before, in greater depth, but even I found it very clear and I rarely agree with the critics who find sexual innuendo in the most basic of films.Dr. Strangelove is really funny and memorable, even still after all these years.

This movie still holds up over 40 years later and that's saying quite a lot, especially in a day and age when most people look back on films from the 1960s and frown because they were largely known for being optimistic, colorized and starring clean-cut wholesome leading stars who don't recognize a world outside their own sickeningly sweet borders.Kubrick was always way ahead of his times and if Dr. Strangelove were made today it would still be considered edgy in some ways. It touches on certain areas of politics that, particularly right now, are fragile and easily upset.On top of that the not-so-subtle sexual allegories must have slipped by the censors. The opening credits begin with phallus-shaped missiles that are a clear metaphor; they are also linked to the subject of battle which creates a sexual fetish regarding warfare. On top of that there is the General with his cigar and the precious bodily fluids. The sexual symbolism has been written about before, in greater depth, but even I found it very clear and I rarely agree with the critics who find sexual innuendo in the most basic of films.Dr. Strangelove is really funny and memorable, even still after all these years. Not many films can carry that honor. This is a classic whose reputation speaks for itself and doesn't outweigh its lasting effect; in essence, a must-see.

It was not until I began a fascination with Martin Scorsese's movies that I stayed up late to watch this one night on television, to see if the controversy surrounding it was appropriate or not.If you've read The Da Vinci Code you're already familiar with the concept that Jesus Christ (played here by Willem Dafoe) was more flesh and bones than we given Him credit for, and was tempted to betray God and live with His true love, Mary Magdalene, rather than die for our sins. This is referenced by Dan Brown in the overlong and silly 20-page explanation of the true Holy Grail -- who Brown proposes is not an object, but a living person Mary Magdalene, whom Jesus impregnated.The Catholic Church took an immediate disliking to this concept. As Scorsese's film not-so-subtly implies that this is the case, it was panned and, in some cases, banned; the Church called it sacrilegious and many people refused to even see it, just based on its subject matter.Robert De Niro turned down the lead role of Jesus in The Last Temptation of Christ, and probably because he was aware of the controversy it would stir. It was one of the only roles Scorsese offered him that he has turned down, the other being The Butcher in Gangs of New York. Although The Last Temptation of Christ is made with some insight and Scorsese suffered trials and tribulations to bring it to the screen, I'd say it's one of the lesser efforts of Scorsese and writer Paul Schrader's combined efforts.The film is interesting but the acting is a bit off. I remember one sequence where Harvey Keitel (playing Judas) beats Jesus and Jesus lowers to Judas' feet and begs forgiveness. It all seems a bit hokey and staged, and Harvey Keitel is out-of-place, wearing what looks to be a very odd replica of the era's clothing.The movie is based on a novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, whose work was complete fiction, as the author himself has claimed. As a result Scorsese's work is not claiming to be an accurate depiction of Christ's death, but rather a new twist to the tale based on another book.Do I think this is wrong? To be honest, yes, I do. On one hand I consider a fresh perspective refreshing, but on the other hand it seems wrong to base anything off of religious iconography and attempt to twist it into something human.Scorsese had to knew what he'd endure to release this. I don't think it was a surprise.But enough about the controversy. Purely as a film, The Last Temptation of Christ is beautiful to look at but I do feel some of it is rather hokey. As I mentioned above, some of the acting seems misplaced. Mel's version is definitely the more realistic of the two.But if you do have a (very) open mind and are not religious you might enjoy this. If you are religious and have a closed mind about your faith, stay away from this and The Da Vinci Code as they'll both probably just upset you and cause stress.In my opinion The Last Temptation of Christ is a good movie, but I do understand why people were outraged (and I rarely do with films) because Scorsese is touching on a very fragile subject matter here and it would have been quite naive of him to expect people to love his film. I like to think that he was smart enough to foresee the hatred for this movie. I'm pretty sure he knew.

It all seems a bit hokey and staged, and Harvey Keitel is out-of-place, wearing what looks to be a very odd replica of the era's clothing.The movie is based on a novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, whose work was complete fiction, as the author himself has claimed. As a result Scorsese's work is not claiming to be an accurate depiction of Christ's death, but rather a new twist to the tale based on another book.Do I think this is wrong? To be honest, yes, I do. On one hand I consider a fresh perspective refreshing, but on the other hand it seems wrong to base anything off of religious iconography and attempt to twist it into something human.Scorsese had to knew what he'd endure to release this. I don't think it was a surprise.But enough about the controversy. Purely as a film, The Last Temptation of Christ is beautiful to look at but I do feel some of it is rather hokey. As I mentioned above, some of the acting seems misplaced. Mel's version is definitely the more realistic of the two.But if you do have a (very) open mind and are not religious you might enjoy this. If you are religious and have a closed mind about your faith, stay away from this and The Da Vinci Code as they'll both probably just upset you and cause stress.In my opinion The Last Temptation of Christ is a good movie, but I do understand why people were outraged (and I rarely do with films) because Scorsese is touching on a very fragile subject matter here and it would have been quite naive of him to expect people to love his film. I like to think that he was smart enough to foresee the hatred for this movie. I'm pretty sure he knew.

After all, doomed love is a bigger sell, especially when you have the romantic faces of Clift and Taylor swooning together in extreme close-up. I'm not a fan of doing book to movie comparisons. I figure that film and literature are two different art forms, so I shouldn't compare their rendering of the story anymore than I would compare the same story as presented in a painting as opposed to a ballet. So I tried to take the film on its own merits (admittedly difficult to do, since I watched the movie on the same day I finished the book), but even at that, I think the movie falls short.Clift plays George Eastman, poor nephew to a rich, socially elite family in a small New York state factory town. He's been invited by his uncle to come and work in the Eastman factory, giving him an entre into a world of luxury that has always been out of his grasp due to his family's humble position (they run a mission and preach on the streets). George strikes up a love affair with Alice Tripp (Shelley Winters), a girl who works with him in the factory, but his attentions for her quickly fade when he becomes interested in Angela Vickers, another member of the rich set, played by Liz Taylor. Complications ensue, and George finds himself and his situation spiraling drastically out of control, with an ending more tragic than he ever thought possible.George Stevens directs the film with a sure hand, and there are some breathtaking displays of directorial skill. For example, one that stands out in my mind comes when the camera focuses on a radio reporting a possible murder, while the young, rich kids with whom George has struck up a friendship goof off in the water in the background. There are also some great uses of dissolve editing, though the technique is somewhat overused.But there are many problems with the film, notably its pacing. Much time is spent on George's love triangle with Alice and Angela, while the script races through the trial and George's ultimate fate, as if the screenwriter realized he only had two hours to tell his story when he'd already wasted an hour and a half on front-end material. Rushing through the end blunts much of the story's original intent and power, as that is where the majority of moral questions arise.Also, the character Shelley Winters plays is so drab and mousy, that one doesn't understand why George would entangle himself with her in the first place. But Clift does a great job with the lead role, delivering a performance of raw nerve.It befuddles me somewhat as to why this movie is quite so acclaimed. I can only imagine that its reception has to do with cultural moods at the time it was released and that it just hasn't aged well. It came out in 1951, a big year for literary adaptations (A Streetcar Named Desire and Death of a Salesman were both given big-screen treatments that year), and you only need to compare Sun to Streetcar to see how short it falls at capturing the essence of a true literary classic.Grade B- ","genre":null},{"date":"29 April 2005","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" It was probably inevitable that An American Tragedy, in its evolution to screen, would become more about the doomed love affair of Montgomery Clift and Elizabeth Taylor than the moral and ethical dilemmas that really form the foundation of Theodore Dreiser's novel.
