People started to take more drugs, in North America, Western Europe and even in the Soviet Union. Many countries ended up supplying the drugs, such as Columbia, Panama and Afghanistan. Ronald Reagen even declared on the war on drugs, a massive domestic and international effort to stop the flow of drugs in America. America is still fighting this war. The war on drugs became a source of influence to American storytellers, such as Tom Clancy with his good novel Clear and Present Danger, some episodes of the greatest American TV show the West Wing, and of course, Traffic, which was based on a British TV series. The action within Traffic ends up transfered from the UK to the United States and Mexico.Traffic tells three interwoven stories. One story is set in Mexico, about a Baja Californian police officer, Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) an officer who isn't corrupt. He gets recruited by General Salazar (Tomás Milián), who is the head of Mexican anti-drugs campaign. In Ohio and Washington D.C. Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) becomes the head of the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, and sees that massive scope of the problem. His 16-year-old daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen), who is a very intelligence, happens to be addicted to heroin and cocaine. Robert has to tackle both a massive political problem, and a problem at home. The third story is set in San Diego, about Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a suburban woman whom happen has been arrested for being a drug boss. She ends up getting in debt and struggling to survive. Her husband is being investigated by DEA agents Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzmán). Helena is slowly forced into dark underbelly of crime.All three stories could easily have worked as individual films but Stephen Gaghan and Steven Soderbergh have done a brilliant job combining the three stories in a really compelling film. It shows the complex nature of the war on drugs, from the cartels in Mexico who supply the drugs (and as we have seen recently Mexico is turning Columbia), law-enforcement in both the United States and Mexico, the actions that American politicians takes, from treatment problems, to law enforcement, and the personal efforts it on people. It's a complex film, and that's what makes it good. Gaghan deserves his Oscar for screenplay. Soderbergh won a Best Oscar for Traffic. He was nominated the year before for Edin Brockovich, which was a more Hollywood type film, Traffic had a more independence feel to it, and is Soderbergh's best film. He keeps the balance of all three story, not letting any of them drop. The film is wonderfully shot, using different filters and colours for the different stories. The Mexican story shot almost like a 70s style thriller, the Wakefield story is shot with blue lighting, giving it a more indie drama feel, and the action in San Diego is shot like a normal American film\/TV programme, like the Wire. They is good pacing, and keeps the film going. He shows real skill dealing with a complex script.There is an excellent cast to the film, Benicio Del Toro and Don Cheadle are two talented actors who rarely put a foot wrong, both giving very good performance. Michael Douglas is in his best role since playing Gordon Gekko in Wall Street. This is easily going to be the best film Catherine Zeta-Jones will ever do. Erika Christensen gives a compelling performance as a drug addicted teenager, whilst Topher Grace is perfectly annoying (as he was meant to be). However, I did not like the slightly camp quality in Tomás Milián's performance.A brilliant film, 5 out of 5.

Seeing his family struggle to make ends meet and failing, George vows never to share a similar fate. Moving to California, he starts his own pot pushing operation in which he finds both success and imprisonment. In prison, he meets a cellmate who introduces him into a partnership to the lucrative new market in cocaine. Upon release, George Jung quickly becomes instrumental in establishing the exploding US market for cocaine in which he claimed that he handled about 85% of the supply in the 1970's. However, for all the fabulous wealth and power he gained, the true costs of his dangerously treacherous occupation catch up with him in ways from which he would never recover... Blow is a very interesting biography that shows George Jung as a complex individual and in some ways, a victim of the American dream. One can also argue, that the poverty-stricken environment he grew up in, may have shaped George's mentality and ideology and pushed him, even if not directly, to dealing drugs. After all, at the time, dealing drugs was nothing more then an easy way to make money, and that was George's goal, so he wouldn't have to go trough , again, what he went trough in his childhood. The story has a very fast pace and the self-narration is great, and an element that I always enjoy in films. The direction is quite stylish and Depp, who plays the lead character, George Jung, delivers a great performance and showed, as always, bucket-loads of charisma. He plays this role in a way that everyone will sympathize with the character despite him being involved in illegal affairs. Definitely, one of the actor's best performances. Ray Liotta, who plays George's father was also very good, and it's heartbreaking to see the character suffering with his son's imprisonment, because despite not agreeing with what George was doing, he truly loved him and always supported him. Penelope Cruz who plays George's second wife was a bit over the top for my taste but nothing that ruins the film. The only negative aspect of Blow, is the fact that the story spans three decades and some of the characters, like George's parents for instance, seem to age very little. I know this is a technicality but it's something that should have been paid more attention to. Overall, Blow is a fine example of story-telling and film-making.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 December 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" George Jung is the son of a struggling small business owner.

Genre movies were getting big as well, none more so than the Western. And why not? If anything could benefit from a 2.351 aspect ratio and the increasing ease of colour photography, it was the open plain.But like many of the bigger pictures of the day, especially those from the independent studios, a gallant attempt has been made to add drama to the spectacle. The screenplay went through a lot of hands, usually a good sign, and in this case the hands include those of novelist Jessamyn West and noted Western screenwriter James R. Webb. The outstanding feature here is the dialogue, which has a very clipped pace and even rhythm to it, so that characters snap the lines back-and-forth like pistol shots. The wording is often a little abstract, almost poetic, but the meaning is always clear, and even if they don't sound like things said by real people, the feel of the words always matches the character. It's even slyly comical, with odd lines like the one about Burl Ives' speech being a beardful likely to raise a smile.The cast is an unusual one, at least at first glance. Gregory Peck never really looked at home in a Western, but this is what makes him ideal for the greenhorn-from-back-East role. In director William Wyler's shooting scheme, he isn't treated to as many close-ups as some of the other characters, and this performance is more about the way he moves or looks out over the landscape. His antagonist Charlton Heston does get a lot of close-ups, as it's up to him to convey his affection for Carroll Baker &#x96; never directly referenced &#x96; through jealous glances at her and Peck. He does a meaningful but understated job, and this is by far the best I have seen from him. Surely the oddest person to see in a Western is Jean Simmons, but she is very believable in what is also one of the more complex roles. Then of course there is Burl Ives, who deservedly won the picture's only Oscar, by managing to bring out a rough humanity from beneath the bulk and beard. By the way, have a look over that cast list, and think of just how many heads must have turned every time someone yelled out Chuck! Let's look a bit more at William Wyler's input. His choice of how to shoot each actor at each moment &#x96; e.g. close-up, long-shot, face or back to camera &#x96; was often very irregular, even to the point of defying film convention, but it was always to serve the nature of the character, the mood of each scene or the picture in general. His previous effort, Friendly Persuasion, also his first in 'scope actually loses some much needed intimacy because Wyler seemed suddenly at odds with the new frame shape. For the Big Country however he actually uses the size of the screen to give a feeling of distance and emptiness. Peck and Carroll have many of their embraces isolated in the middle of the screen. Characters are sometimes seen seated at opposite ends of the frame, the gulf between them exaggerated. And this pattern is carried through into the outdoor shots, Wyler having chosen an extremely flat and barren location. More than once characters make analogies between the plain and the ocean, and Wyler has acknowledged that in the way he films it.A brief note on Jerome Moross's music. This score has been widely praised and resulted in Moross's only Oscar nomination. I grant that it sounds very much the archetypal Western theme, and there are some nice orchestrations. However it is mind-numbingly repetitive, contains some stupid cues (like the circus music heard after Peck tames Old Thunder) and after two hours and forty minutes becomes banal and grating.A little side point perhaps, that about the music, but I feel it relates to some of this picture's wider problems. The Big Country is just a bit too long. True, some stories do merit a lengthy runtime but this, for all its scope, is still just a little story &#x96; a handful of people in a simple situation. It is not the tale of a culture or a generation. And while the score is almost stereotypically Western-ish, the rest of the picture really isn't. Like the earlier High Noon, it is a political allegory set out West, which isn't a bad thing in itself, just that it doesn't really feel quite like a Western. Unlike the excellent Shane, it doesn't seem to have respect for the people or conventions of the genre. As such, it's a worthy but slightly hollow experience.

","genre":"Romance, Western"},{"date":"16 December 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" There aren't many overcoming-the-odds stories quite like that of Christy Brown. Born with cerebral palsy in 1930s Dublin, his parents thought his handicap was mental as well as physical. Though eventually properly diagnosed, Brown, in a lower working-class family with nearly 20 children, had to push himself just to be appreciated by his family. Through the use of his only fully-functioning limb, his left leg, he taught himself to write and paint, both skills he developed expertly. But what makes the film version of Brown's autobiography My Left Foot such a great retelling is its humility. Both director\/writer Jim Sheridan and star Daniel Day-Lewis have managed to tell this story in a way that doesn't scream for attention and resort to melodrama. Cheesy struggles and scenes of frustration as well as glorious moments of minute victory are easy pitfalls of a story so miraculous, yet My Left Foot stays real and intrinsically inspired.Day-Lewis is the easiest to highlight. Playing anyone with such serious physical impairments has to be a demanding task. Not only does Day-Lewis give us a very complete picture of Christy, but he also manages to chronicle the growth, improvement and inner change of the character in different stages of his life. He plays Christy at 17 when he had limited language capability and was emotionally volatile just as crisply as he does the intellectually learned Christy who struggles to cope with why he can't find non-platonic love. The latter theme is the film's strongest and it would've been nice for Sheridan and co-adapter Shane Connaughton to really flesh that out. Regardless, Day-Lewis gets us to understand and sympathize with all those elements, giving a performance that's so believable you often don't have time to think wow, he's such a great actor. Those are the most commendable performances.Equally important but through more subtle means is Sheridan's work on the film. This story is about day-to-day life and struggles. Although Christy has such a unique set of circumstances hampering his life, his struggles are not unlike our own and Sheridan grasps that concept completely. Christy struggles with love, parental attention, questions of self- worth and capability. His struggles are just more physically manifested (literally and figuratively) than ours. Sheridan gives us moments that capture the spirit of the large Brown family and Christy's unique place in it.

Her love for Christy and constant fighting for him just seems so convincing and heartfelt and she earns a lot of sympathy given her situation.The emotional punch of the film given the story is surprisingly minimal.

Born with cerebral palsy in 1930s Dublin, his parents thought his handicap was mental as well as physical. Though eventually properly diagnosed, Brown, in a lower working-class family with nearly 20 children, had to push himself just to be appreciated by his family. Through the use of his only fully-functioning limb, his left leg, he taught himself to write and paint, both skills he developed expertly. But what makes the film version of Brown's autobiography My Left Foot such a great retelling is its humility. Both director\/writer Jim Sheridan and star Daniel Day-Lewis have managed to tell this story in a way that doesn't scream for attention and resort to melodrama. Cheesy struggles and scenes of frustration as well as glorious moments of minute victory are easy pitfalls of a story so miraculous, yet My Left Foot stays real and intrinsically inspired.Day-Lewis is the easiest to highlight. Playing anyone with such serious physical impairments has to be a demanding task. Not only does Day-Lewis give us a very complete picture of Christy, but he also manages to chronicle the growth, improvement and inner change of the character in different stages of his life. He plays Christy at 17 when he had limited language capability and was emotionally volatile just as crisply as he does the intellectually learned Christy who struggles to cope with why he can't find non-platonic love. The latter theme is the film's strongest and it would've been nice for Sheridan and co-adapter Shane Connaughton to really flesh that out. Regardless, Day-Lewis gets us to understand and sympathize with all those elements, giving a performance that's so believable you often don't have time to think wow, he's such a great actor. Those are the most commendable performances.Equally important but through more subtle means is Sheridan's work on the film. This story is about day-to-day life and struggles. Although Christy has such a unique set of circumstances hampering his life, his struggles are not unlike our own and Sheridan grasps that concept completely. Christy struggles with love, parental attention, questions of self- worth and capability. His struggles are just more physically manifested (literally and figuratively) than ours. Sheridan gives us moments that capture the spirit of the large Brown family and Christy's unique place in it.

But that is its reputation, as part of the late 1960s revival of American Cinema that includes Bonnie and Clyde and The Graduate (both 1967). The Wild Bunch is in many ways another violent western, shot widescreen, with a scree of familiar archetypes (good guy, bad guy, ditzy banker, pretty woman, and dull witted Mexican, and even more dull witted Texan losers, none of which are true in those cardboard terms). And it came out years after the more stunning (in many ways) Leone westerns such as The Good, The Bad, The Ugly and Fistful of Dollars. But I glossed over something important--the violence. There is a frank new use of language (swearing) or sexuality (in some totally improbable and ludicrous scenes in a winery, for example), but it is the relentless, almost comically excessive violence, amazing blood and guts killing and mayhem, that brands this film. Lots of innocent people die, lots of bad guys die, even some of the archetypal women in love with the bad guys get brutally shot. And this, all of it, without the John Ford sense of justice or propriety, is something new.Whether you think it marks a decline in values or a rise in cinema art (pushing boundaries, devaluing violence to the point that it becomes artful, and therefore oddly non-violent, a la Tarantino), it's also possible to see the movie as a superb tale of greed, vengeance, and tested loyalty. And corporate selfishness, certainly a new theme that fits the late 60s perfectly.This is William Holden's performance of a lifetime. He plays a bad man with scary resoluteness, and the cast of misfits and miscreants around him (including a terrific Ernest Borgnine) only solidify his stature on the screen. Seemingly cast opposite him is his ex-buddy, played by Robert Ryan, and the ragtag bums around him are meant to be partly comical, though tragedy is suggested for many right from the get go. The robberies and the long chases through beautiful Wild West country, leading across the border into Mexico, are terrific tropes for any moviemaker--and for the audience, which had seen, surely some of the big 1950s westerns, and probably some of the Leone ones, too. So, all the hedging above aside, and removing some aspects of the movie that are either offensive or just dumb (a few short scenes that will vary depending on the viewer), The Wild Bunch is a thrilling, intense ride. It's a ride, remember, an entertainment. It doesn't lack probing elements, but it plays into the drama of the setting and the big characters galloping through it, simple as that.

I saw the film when i was 18 in that stage most people like either full action or supernatural horror movies but this movie at that time made a place in my heart.

In the beginning of the film, she debates whether to leave her mother and her boring life and join Clyde or to stay put and stay safe. Clyde convinces her that if she resents her job as a waitress and the dates with boys that just want to sleep with her, that she should accompany him. It doesn't take much persuasion before she agrees with him and sacrifices her old life for a life of excitement.Another conflict seen in Bonnie and Clyde is the way of living chosen by the Barrow gang clashing with the restrictions of the law. The law enforcement is constantly trying to capture the group of robbers. The gang is evading every attempt until finally they kill Buck and gain custody of his wife, are led to C.W.'s house where they conspire with C.W.'s father to trap Bonnie and Clyde to kill them, and arrest C.W. The film was set during the Great Depression in the Midwest, ranging from Oklahoma to Texas. The gang runs in and out of small towns and spends their nights in cabins, squatting in abandoned houses, or camping in fields. The time has a tremendous effect on the characters. During the Great Depression, many people could not pay back loans to the banks and lost their houses and possessions. These people regarded the Barrow gang as heroes for having the courage to take the money back from the bank. Also, having an endless supply of free money was appealing to Bonnie during these especially hard times, and aided in her decision to join Clyde. Because Bonnie and Clyde were so removed from society, it helped to form their dependence on one another. Another effect of their situation was being constantly in close proximity with the other members of their group. This frustrates Bonnie and causes her to resent her partners even more because she just wants to be alone with Clyde. The most prominent symbol comes early in the film. The day that Bonnie and Clyde first meet and are drinking sodas in town, Clyde shows Bonnie his handgun. The way he is holding it at his hips and how she reaches out to touch it transforms the gun into a phallic symbol. This means that her attraction to Clyde is dangerous.Another symbol from the film is the constantly changing cars. This shows the free spirited nature of Clyde, and how he loves to search for new and exciting things. When Bonnie says But this is the car we came in! and Clyde responds That doesn't mean that's the one we have to leave in. This illustrates how they have endless possibilities and no restrictions. Whatever they want, they can take. One theme of this film is publicity. Everyone knows about Bonnie and Clyde, the famous bank robbers of the Barrow Gang. Newspapers were constantly referenced and people treated Bonnie and Clyde like stars. When the gang stole the car of Eugene Grizzard, played by Gene Wilder, Eugene and his girlfriend Velma were excited to find it was them and enjoyed spending the night driving around and getting burgers with the group. Bonnie and Clyde loved to be in the public eye, and introduced themselves to everyone when they were stealing. Bonnie had her picture taken with the Texas sheriff to have it sent to the newspapers and published. This was a punishment for him for traveling out of his jurisdiction to hunt them when the Barrow gang thought that he should be in Texas, protecting the poor. The picture showed Bonnie kissing the sheriff and Clyde standing beside them smiling. This created a bad image for the sheriff and he lost his credibility because of it.Bonnie also had her poetry published in the newspapers. She wanted everyone to know the truth about the group, about her love for Clyde, and the story of their lives. She wanted to let people know that they were good people who were on the wrong side of the law. They killed people and knew it wasn't right, but it's what they needed to do to survive because when they were caught, they would die.Although I prefer movies that are shorter and more concise, I would recommend this movie to most of my friends. I enjoyed the story and the pacing of the plot. Sympathizing with the villains and telling their story through their point of view is something that has never been done before this time, due to the Hays Code. Because of this, it makes the film an important stepping stone in cinematic history.This is a film that could be watched at anytime. It would suit the mood for a romance, comedy, crime, thriller, or drama.

Because of this, it makes the film an important stepping stone in cinematic history.This is a film that could be watched at anytime. It would suit the mood for a romance, comedy, crime, thriller, or drama. The cast performs brilliantly, with the exception of Gene Wilder who is not so convincing and ruins the verisimilitude, however seeing a film with Gene Wilder is a treat in itself, no matter the context.

Joel and Ethan, those wildly creative brothers from Minnesota, started out simple enough, with just enough money and supplies to create the exact world they wanted. The result is Blood Simple, simply one of the most effective and well-made film noirs you will ever see.The plot is simple enough; a man and woman are having an affair and her husband wants them both dead. He hires an unsettling of a private detective, and just as it seems all will go smoothly and quietly, it all blows up. One of the great benefits of this film is the way in which the Coens wrote and edited each scene. Every single frame and scene add up and build upon each other to come to a huge climax; and there are several here.The acting is superb, restrained and totally under control by the actors. A young and stunning Frances McDormand, John Getz, and Dan Hedaya all lend their talents, but it is M. Emmet Walsh who commands all the attention as the mysterious and complex detective whose actions spark the fire about to go off.Mostly what Blood Simple does is establish a style and creative pattern so unique, it reminds you of a director like Hitchcock or Kubrick. What the Coens have in common with those great ones is that they know exactly what they want out of every department of the film. And they know exactly what is needed to entice and keep the grip of suspense on the audience. Little sounds and squeaks haunt the soundtrack, lights go on and off, and blood is spilled. It may have 'Simple' in the title, but look closer and this movie is anything but simple.

I remember how impressed I was with the original concept of a man whose entire life is filmed for the world to see (unbeknownst to him). With reality shows being the 'it' thing on current television (as much as I loathe most of them), this film is one of the first of its kind to raise the question regarding the value of privacy and its contribution to ones freedom. Weir very convincingly tells the story of Truman Burbank and his struggle for a new life. I like the way he sets the mise-en-scene. His story juxtaposes very well with the audience's (in the movie) reactions and the studio's operation. This is the first film through which Jim Carrey has gained credit for playing a non-comedic role. Carrey is fantastic in the title role and he is wonderfully supported by the manipulative Ed Harris and the phony Laura Linney.

It embodies all of Ford's faults and none of his strengths even the visual framing of the scenes, something Ford is usually an instinctive master of, seems pedestrian. Why some critics have praised the acting is beyond me the actors give the sort of performances which look like they're primarily motivated by an anxiety to let you know that they're really acting.

I enjoyed it. Orson Welles did a fantastic job directing and writing this movie. I know why so many people love it, and why it always sits atop many best of lists. I could quote several lines from this movie before I had even seen it. The story is intriguing, and Welles does an excellent job portraying Charles Kane. So while I loved the movie very much, and it was truly groundbreaking for its time, I don't think that I could watch it over and over like some people do, and it is definitely not at the top of my best of list.

We're also introduced to TurboMan, the it superhero of the day and shown a commercial for the TurboMan toy, the new it action figure for the Christmas season. Jamie wants one naturally. We see Howard lie to Liz and say that he's already bought the toy even though he hasn't.We're exposed to Howard's busy work-life and his inability to make it to Jamie's karate belt ceremony early into the movie, which is a very important milestone to a young boy! Liz has a talk with Howard where she tells him how important this TurboMan action figure is to Jamie this year and how Howard's work has made him neglectful towards his family. Howard somehow decides that if Jamie doesn't get the TurboMan doll this year, he might end up as a bum, who drinks too! This is the set up for the wacky and usually exciting adventure that ensues. Every store is sold out of TurboMan action figures. We follow Howard through the entire Christmas day looking for this TurboMan doll, and everything that can go wrong, does. He meets Myron (Sinbad), a postal worker who also wants a TurboMan doll for his son. They help each other sometimes, set each other back other times. Generally, it's a fun relationship.I can recall great scenes such as when Howard is chasing a raffle ball throughout a mall and even into a ball pit, he fights a giant Santa (The Big Show) in search of this doll for Jamie. The movie ends in a spectacularly cheesy scene that most kids will love.My only real complaint with the movie is that it doesn't end with Jamie realizing the lengths Howard went to in getting him a TurboMan doll and that being more important than any superhero.In the light comedy category 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 December 2009","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" At the beginning of the movie, we're introduced to Howard (Arnold Schwarzenegger), his wife, Liz (Rita Wilson), and their son, Jamie (Jake Lloyd).

While it still contained some great laughs, it also contained a very strong portrait of an African American woman that I never saw back when the movie first came out. Think about it--She's a computer operator, one of the first to be shown on screen chatting and skilled in hardware and software. She's gutsy, doesn't need a man to help her. She's independent, strong, and beautiful but not in a typical way. She's not a rock emotionally. You feel for here as she waits at the restaurant for Jack. You can feel the caring she shows for her friends, co-workers She still gets the man--a white man!-- in the end, at least that's the implication. All of this in 1986! This new perspective for the movie has certainly lifted it above all the dated material (Annie Potts' hair, the computer terminals) What a statement! Go Terr-eee!
