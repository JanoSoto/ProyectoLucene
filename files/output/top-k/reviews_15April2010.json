Star Wars episode 1 The Phantom Menace should have been made with the same mindset as Star Wars episode 4 A New Hope. Unfortunately, Lucas has forgotten his roots as a filmmaker and is now a businessman. Episode 1 shoved as much childish crap into each frame so that the marketing division could appeal to the dumb kid demographic. In doing so Lucas has forgotten some basic points about his OWN FRANCHISE.1. No villain. There is Darth Maul, I guess. He says one line, it was so clichéd I forgot it immediately. There's also the hooded dude who appears as a hologram, he's obviously SPOILER WARNING and he doesn't really do anything either. Also you don't know what the bad guys want. How would blockading Naboo really achieve anything? There are other, easier ways SPOILER WARNING could get what he\/she\/it wants. It's like Lucas wrote all these cool scenes about invasion and realized it had nothing to do with anything, so he tied it all up with something about the Sith's evil plan five minutes before shooting was about to start. On another note, if the main opposition is a bunch of useless robots that the characters can squash like insects, there's no tension. Throughout the whole film, all you do is question the actions of the characters, pointing out all the things they could have done to make the movie 20 minutes long.2. Childish crap. People complain about Jar-Jar Binks and rightfully so. I think that Lucas had began to slip in Return when he added the Ewoks. Maybe his 14 year break was an attempt to quell the merchandising beast within, it is my belief that this strategy failed miserably. There are kids everywhere in this film and the droids act like clowns with laser guns. 3. Stupid Plot I've already mentioned the stupid plot and I'm gonna mention it again. Stupid god damned plot. All of the characters act like they are being mind controlled by the racist federation characters. While people are directing their ire towards Jar-Jar, the real stereotypes are the slimy space slugs who practically regurgitate every negative Asian slur thinkable.4.Intergalactic space politics ZZZZZZZZ...If this film is trying so hard to appeal to kids, why do they insert space politics? How does it improve the film to have endless scenes of aliens talking policy? I don't understand! This problem gets worse in the later films. So essentially you have Jar-Jar Binks and Ewoks on one end and on the other you have people getting their limbs amputated, genocide, child murder and people being roasted alive in screaming limbless agony.The good things 1. Liam Neeson This is probably the only reason I gave this film anything other than 1 star, he is truly the best character of the prequel trilogy and even with the terrible script he still exudes charisma. 2.Amazing visuals All things considered, the film is very good looking, I know this is probably to appeal to kids but if I had to give Lucas a grade based only on style 10\/10.

The play certainly caught my attention, just like it obviously did to many people who heard it when it was first broadcast, decades before I was born. Several years after its original broadcast, it was adapted to this film-noir by Fletcher herself, starring Barbara Stanwyck. After hearing the radio play for the first time last year, I was already interested in seeing this movie. This month, I heard the play for the second time and then finally got around to watching this 1948 adaptation. Was it as good as I could have possibly hoped for? Definitely not, but I thought most of it was at least reasonably well done.Leona Stevenson is a wealthy heiress who is bedridden due to a severe illness. One night, she is all alone in her New York home. Her husband, Henry, promised he would be home hours ago, but for some mysterious reason, he still isn't back! With nobody else around and Leona hardly able to walk, the only way she can contact anyone is through the telephone beside her bed. She tries to call Henry, but does not succeed. Instead, the phone lines cross, and she hears a conversation between two thugs who are planning the murder of a woman, which is intended to happen at 1115 that night! Obviously shocked at what she has just heard, Leona is determined to foil this evil plan she now knows about, and begins to call different people on the phone. During the series of phone calls, starting unsuccessfully with the operator and the police, she gradually learns a lot, as we learn more about the character, her husband, and other people she knows! This version of Sorry, Wrong Number is mostly steady around the beginning, with the lead character in bed on the phone soon hearing the sinister conversation. Unfortunately, it doesn't stay consistent. In order to make a full-length movie out of the story, it obviously had to be extended, and one of the ways they extended it here was by adding a series of flashbacks. Not all of these work so well, including the tedious one early in the film showing how Leona's relationship with Henry began. This part really shows how unlikable our lead character is! However, while the film drags in a number of spots, there is a decent amount of suspense for much of the time, sometimes with an intense and haunting atmosphere, and most of the flashbacks do work. There's also great cinematography, with some nice shots of New York City, sometimes through Leona's window, and mostly good acting, with a decent if slightly flawed performance from Barbara Stanwyck, and other notable performances such as Burt Lancaster as Henry Stevenson. So, while this 1948 film-noir is no masterpiece, and is inferior to the radio play which it's based on, fans of suspense might want to give it a try.

It seems you either love it with a vengeance and woe betide anyone who doesn't agree, or you hate it so passionately you would happily murder the poor actors and actresses simply for appearing in it.This is ridiculous. While I do enjoy the film, I have no problems with people who didn't, and if they dislike the romance then that's their opinion, which they're entitled to. Seriously, why turn it into something? Personally speaking, this is still one of my favourite films, and I saw it years after it came out (as always) so the success had ebbed away. But unlike so many, I didn't go with expectations. All those people who went for a documentary on the disaster, or endless shots of old Leo... I saw it without expecting anything. I didn't give a monkeys about DiCaprio, I knew next to nothing about the actual disaster, and I was simply hoping it deserved its record-breaking 11 Academy Awards. And I thought it did, frankly.The acting was top-notch, the music was wonderful, the visuals were stunning. While the romance was indeed stereotypical and contrived (and I gave this a ten), it was still pulled off excellently, and I really did feel for the character, which is a mark of a good film. I don't think that the ending spoilt the film, which many people think it did. I am not saying that they are wrong, or that I am right, because that's not true. It's about opinions. I just thought it was a nice touch - a sort of backhanded happy ending to round off an otherwise rather depressing Now-they'll-never-see-each-other-again scenario. I thought the film had many, many memorable moments, and the disaster itself was not downplayed - it fitted smoothly around the romance, which incidentally helped to give a sense of perspective to the whole thing. Many couples really will have been torn apart that night, albeit probably not from different classes. The sheer drama unfolding on-screen cannot really be questioned. It can be disliked, of course. But it is good acting nevertheless.

For those who have seen Star Wars but have no idea who I'm talking about, Porkins is Red Six. He is a young, ambitious member of the Rebel Alliance whose dreams of kicking ass and taking names were cut tragically short when his T-65 X-wing starfighter was struck by debris, leaving him with several mechanical and computer malfunctions during the assault on the Empire's planet-sized Death Ball. During his moment of technical weakness, Porkins was sucker blasted by enemy turbolaser fire and killed. There have been many jokes at the expense of Jek Porkins' honorable memory. For example, some have said that Jek's X-wing simply couldn't take the weight of his masculine frame, that it simply wasn't realistic. Well, how realistic is it for a retarded sand savage to leave a wimpy farmboy without a crushed skull when he has ...a skull crusher? How realistic is it for a princess to walk out of a giant garbage disposal with her virginal white dress completely unstained?

Not true! The true heart of this epic saga is the character of Jek Porkins, the portly, ill-fated, X-wing pilot of Red Squadron. For those who have seen Star Wars but have no idea who I'm talking about, Porkins is Red Six. He is a young, ambitious member of the Rebel Alliance whose dreams of kicking ass and taking names were cut tragically short when his T-65 X-wing starfighter was struck by debris, leaving him with several mechanical and computer malfunctions during the assault on the Empire's planet-sized Death Ball.

Dreamlike in tone, Ed Wood lovingly imparts to viewers the humorously delusional world of 1950s bad-film artiste Edward D. Wood, Jr. (Johnny Depp), creator of legendary bad films, most notably Plan 9 From Outer Space. Part of the film's charm is how it portrays Wood, gushing with uncalled-for enthusiasm and optimism. Depp's facial expressions are priceless; that glib smile, those bugged-out eyes, the raised eyebrows, all enhanced by exaggerated makeup.But no amount of incompetence can deny Wood's passion for making films. With a big megaphone to call out commands to his actors, Wood is like a ten-year-old boy, thoughtless of the finished product; he just wants to play movie director.Wood surrounds himself with a motley crew of Hollywood misfits, including most especially washed-up Dracula actor Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), whose relationship with Wood propels most of the film's plot. But there are other, equally eccentric, people drawn to Wood, the most interesting being Bunny Breckinridge (a surprisingly good performance by Bill Murray), Vampira (Lisa Marie), and Criswell (Jeffrey Jones), that otherworldly seer of the future. The misfit label applies to Wood too, of course, who directs his actors, dressed in women's clothes, seemingly oblivious to the managerial discordance of such attire.The script's characters and the film's high-contrast B&W lighting combine to portray Hollywood as a comically nightmarish place of delusional unreality. Simple sets mirror the cheapness in Wood's world. And that bongo-laced score with accompanying Theremin and crashing symbols is almost hypnotic.Acting is way, way above average. Depp is absolutely terrific. And so is Landau. I can't think of any weak performances. My only problem with this film is that the plot gives a tad too much attention to Lugosi.That Wood was anointed as the worst director of all time seems a bit cruel. At least he had heart and soul. Yet one cannot deny the unintended humor in his films.Wonderfully nostalgic, Ed Wood reflects back to another era in film-making, when thinking big, self-assurance, and nerve were all a young man needed to make his Hollywood dreams come true, no matter how untalented.

As a big horror movies fan, this is my favorite Argento film and it is much better than Phenomena, Inferno and Tenebre.With great special effects and a great background score by the Goblins.The film is about one of the three mothers (Witches) who is called Suspiria or 'the mother of sighs'. Susie Bannion (played by Jessica Harper) arrives at a ballet school in Germany to perfect herself. There she is welcomed by the school's directress, Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett). She befriends Sara (Stefania Casini) who tells her about a friend of hers who had vanished without trace and who believed that the school was actually a coven for witches and the only one who knew of a secret entrance to the coven. When Sara disappears mysteriously, Susie begins to investigate the rumour of The Black Queen who had previously been the owner of the school.This film is a must have for any horror fans film collection.
