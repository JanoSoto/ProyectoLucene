Alexandria, Virginia's segregated high schools are forced to unite and form one uber-school, T.C. Williams High.  Among other major, obvious problems, one problem, the focalpoint of the film, is the newly created football team. Bill Yoast (Will Patton) had been successful as coach of of the white high school in Alexandria for a long time, so when Herman Boone (Denzel Washington) moves in from the black school and is appointed head coach in the name of affirmative action, naturally he's a little angry.  Now, of course there are going to be a few cliches in this movie, it's movie about football, the most cliche ridden thing in our society, but muchos props to Gregory Allen Howard, the screenwriter, for not making the token white coach, the token racist coach.  If there's any tension between Boone and Yoast it's purely because of the situation that they are both dealing with. Despite the general consensus of the town's disapproval, Yoast signs on as the defensive coordinator under Boone. The movie continues on through training camp in Pennsylvania, (which includes a stop at Gettysburg Battlefield) where the racial tension among the players slowly eases over two weeks.  Over the course of the season we get served with a large number of predictable events including  The racist opposing coach who bribes the refs, the one player who refuses to support his black teammates, the token fat kid who helps the players get along better whilst adding some comic relief.  (Ironically enough, played by Ethan Suplee, Seth from American History X) The football scenes are mostly well done, with the exception being the close camera angle that made following the logistics of the play or game difficult at times. One interesting thing to note is the behavior of the citizens in the movie. They were, for the most part, very close-minded and didn't change in these views until the football team started to win.  Whether this says something good about sports for bringing the people together, or something bad about the townfolk for not caring until something good came out of it, is uncertain.

When I was younger, I was innocently enraptured by Chaplin and his balletic sense of physical movement, and thought all his films were works of shining genius.  But the more I read about them, and the more I learnt about cinema, the less miraculous they seemed.  Critics' nagging made me see all the flaws, the hesitant construction, the lack of visual inventiveness, the replacement of emotional depth or ideas with sentimentality, especially in comparison with his dark contemporary, Buster Keaton.  The apple of knowledge had soured a little my taste for the Little Tramp.So how does 'Modern Times', a film I once considered his masterpiece, and one of the great American movies, hold up?  Pretty well, actually.  While you look in vain for the layers and nuances of a Keaton, it is heartening to think that a film like this was made in the largely escapist Hollywood of the 1930s.  It might seem trite to us now, but can you imagine what a largely working class audience must have felt seeing themselves compared to penned sheep at the beginning of a comedy?  That first sequence, of automated men going to work in a ghostly, futuristic city is haunting, owing as much to T.S. Eliot's 'The Waste Land' as Lang's 'Metropolis'.Similarly, it is fashionable to mock Chaplin's political commitment, and not just in the light of his tax-exile in a Swiss chateau.  It is true that every time the tramp is thrust unwillingly into a collective, a political protest, a strike or demonstration, he manages to duck it, his individuality shunning group responsibility.  It is also true that the Victorian mugging of the Tramp and the gamin contrast with the rough facelessness of the masses.  But in what other film, American or otherwise, in the period or now, will you see vicious policeman brutally attacking peaceful protestors, or have theft, flight and mockery of authorities shown as economic neccessities?  The taking over the department store by convicts, thieves, juvenile delinquents and the unemployed may not be as potent as the Last Supper scene in 'Viridiana', but it comes close, and how many Americans actually saw Bunuel's film?My comparison to Bunuel is not entirely gratuitous, and is one way of insisting on Chaplin's modernity, to rescue him from a ghetto of expert vaudeville.  There is one scene where the Tramp, the Gamin and a policeman fall out of a prison van.  We don't see the physical act of falling, just the scatter of bodies.  The framing of this shot, the stillness, the silver stylisation, the lighting, the gestures, jerk the film out of slapstick comedy into something as magical as Cocteau.  A later scene, the Tramp dreaming of domestic life with the Gamin, is a superbly comic variation on this.Another sign of Chaplin's modernity is the treatment of the Tramp.  If we see him as a continuous character, he might seem insufferably unctuous.  But the Tramp isn't a coherent character, but a cipher who fits the demands of wildly differing scenes, who serves as a figure with which Chaplin makes satirical points.  He is no more psychologically plausible than, say, Candide.  His appalling treatment of his co-workers in the factory, his decency to the Gamin, his life in prison cannot be plausibly reconciled as coherent character development.This makes the narrative and the form that contains it more interesting and full of tensions.  For instance, in the opening factory sequence, there is an obvious opposition between the worlds of management and workers which is dramatised in the difference between silent and sound cinema, the latter linked to authority (the boss speaks and looks through cameras and cinema screens), the former is physical, disruptive, linked to the body, a real body that, even just tweaked a little, can destroy the mechanical body of a huge firm (and maybe the body politic?).  When the automated worker becomes a human, his disruption is expressed as sexual, as, in wonderfully bisexual fashion, he tweaks and chases workers and women (how did they get some of these scenes past Hays?).'Modern Times' might seem like a ragbag of barely connected sketches, but the governing metaphor of the film is the circle, from the clock over the opening credits and the circular mechanisms of the huge assembly-line machine, to the circles the Tramp skates, or the dance moves as he does his singing act.  The circularity of mechanised life, of doing the same routine, is formalised by a structure in which the Tramp ends each sequence where he began, having to pick himself up and start again, hence the physical circles he makes.  But the circle is at least familiar and reassuring - you know at least what's coming up.  When the Tramp and Gamin finally break it, take to a straight road, we have no more idea than they do of what will happen to them, as brave a Hollywood ending as there has been, and probably the reason Fellini loved Chaplin so much and, yeah, me too.I would only like to add that Paulette Goddard is a remarkablly rare thing in a Chaplin film, a non-simpering woman - her bug-eyed first appearance, stealing bananas from a boat, knife in hand, and later eating a very suggestive spoil, throb with fierce, libidinal energy, like some demon from a German Expressionist film.  And yet she convincingly matures into a strong, loving woman, one who gets her man a job.  The other thing, continuing the theme of the physical body, is perhaps cinema's first gross-out sequence, as the Tramp as convict and a vicar's wife belch-spar each other.

These songs didn't clash with the theme of the movie, but I think film score rather than song would have been more appropriate, especially since Thomas Newman did such incredible musical work with the climactic moments in 'American Beauty'.Someone else's review mentioned that when the name 'Jon Bon Jovi' appeared on the screen, everyone in the theater laughed.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"18 October 2000","score":"","review":"  I saw this movie as a sneak preview.  I expected very much given all the great reviews I heard (one such reviewer was Jack Valenti of the MPAA). I'm a huge fan of Kevin Spacey and Thomas Newman (composer), and while the acting, directing and production elements of the movie are pretty solid, the script in my opinion needs a lot of work.Some of the lines just made me cringe.  Not in the way that they affected me deeply; rather I thought they were both cheesy and out of place.  Kevin Spacey does a great job at covering up the script problems with his part and he fits the role really well (although I must say it wasn't one I was thrilled to see him in).  Helen Hunt and Haley Joel Osment both give great performances.There are two notable musical interludes that I felt were not necessary. One of them I think was sung by none other than Jon Bon Jovi himself, but I could be wrong.  The other was a female singer I did not recognize.  These songs didn't clash with the theme of the movie, but I think film score rather than song would have been more appropriate, especially since Thomas Newman did such incredible musical work with the climactic moments in 'American Beauty'.Someone else's review mentioned that when the name 'Jon Bon Jovi' appeared on the screen, everyone in the theater laughed.

The film is a behind-the-scenes look at the lives of an atypical band and the experiences they face while touring throughout the country.  Naturally, this unusual production will entertain fans of the rock group in focus, with stories from the band's ten year career, comedic backstage traditions, humor-lacked frolics and fan nudity. The film also includes in depth interviews with each member of the band and conflicts experienced, including a member who struggled with cancer, and the task it was for the Canadians to discover an audience in America. The Barenaked Ladies began in 1988 when the band performed as part of Canada's alternative music scene. Blending easy-listening rock, jazz, and folk, the group toured throughout Canada and London-although hitting the jackpot in the USA was still out of their league until 1997, when appearances on national television programs and talk shows helped to achieve this dream. \tBarenaked in America is inquisitive and stylish, mixing the distinguished personalities of the Barenaked Ladies with zest and humor of the film's clever interviews. The Barenaked Ladies are a peculiar rock group, with interesting perspectives and an intriguing history of success. I also enjoyed the movie's many musical numbers, including the hit One Day, that not only inherits the film, but also provides an effective backdrop.\tThe movie is directed by Jason Priestley, who's credits range from feature films like Eye of the Beholder, Love and Death on Long Island, and Tombstone, to the London production of Warren Leight's Tony Award-winning play Side Man, to his most famous role as Brandon Walsh in the popular Fox television series Beverly Hills 90210. With Barenaked in America, he captures the excitement of individual fans in the audience of the concerts, including one man who is offered one-thousand dollars to bare all-and excepts. \tBarenaked in America is insightful and cultural, although it has points in which electric verve seems to short-circuit itself with daul mumbo-jumbo and sequences lacking interest and motion. Candidly looking at a creative group of odd individuals, Barenaked in America may not consistently pack on the energy and pizzazz we crave, but it does show the earnest point of view of Rock and Roll through the eyes of a unique band. Barenaked in America shows you just how unique the Barenaked Ladies are.

","genre":"Documentary"},{"date":"18 October 2000","score":"","review":"  BARENAKED IN AMERICA \/ (1999) *** (out of four)By Blake French\tBarenaked in America is part documentary, part music video following the Canadian band, Barenaked Ladies (Ed Robertson, Steven Page, Jim Creeggan, Kevin Hearn, and Tyler Stewart) during a two week US rock tour with the #1 single song One Week, in the 1998 album Stunt. The film is a behind-the-scenes look at the lives of an atypical band and the experiences they face while touring throughout the country.  Naturally, this unusual production will entertain fans of the rock group in focus, with stories from the band's ten year career, comedic backstage traditions, humor-lacked frolics and fan nudity. The film also includes in depth interviews with each member of the band and conflicts experienced, including a member who struggled with cancer, and the task it was for the Canadians to discover an audience in America.

It is, without a doubt, one of the WORST movies I have ever seen. Not the worst of the year, not the worst of the decade--one of the worst EVER. Despite the name cast, the acting was simply embarrassing. It wasn't acting as much as posing. I never did really decide if the dialogue was supposed to be that cliched for its campy effect, or if they really meant it--and the dialogue was the high point of the writing. (Listen to Donald Sutherland's accent, and tell me he wasn't doing a parody.) The script is as disjointed as it is--well, silly is the only word that comes to mind. The editing is so clumsy that you feel you are looking at a 1st year film school project--and not a good one, at that. Roger Ebert gave it a minimal one star rating, and I can't believe he was so generous. This is a real stinker.

Basically it's about Maya Larkin (Winona Rider) a teacher at a church that is approached by her priest to go on what seems to be an exorcism. They head off to the local insane asylum where they lock themselves up in a room for a little while with one of the inmates. Basically the exorcism fails and Maya finds papers that the inmate had been writing. Of course it was all in code, so after she figures out the code she realizes it spells Peter Kendell, a novelist who (thank goodness) lives near her. So it turns out that Peter is about to become the anti-Christ (don't you hate when that happens) on his 33rd birthday. Without spoiling the blatantly obvious ending, I will say that the few special effects that took place were pretty good. Slightly reminiscent of Ghost, but none the less creepy. Winona was great in the part - of course she seems to have a knack for playing the creepy girl. I personally would have liked to see the director's portrayal of hell on earth, but oh well.
