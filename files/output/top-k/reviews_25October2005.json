The disembodied fiancé's head and creepy monster thing form a tight bond through the Power of the Serum and form a brave attempt to stop Dr. Bill from maiming any more people in the name of science.The most hilarious scenes involve arm-ripping and over-exerted acting, and an obnoxiously long death scene from one of the doctor's maimed cohorts.

Oscar winning director Billy Wilder makes Don Birnem's struggle something that is unmistakable, especially if you've been around these kinds of people. Most of us have seen the drunk at the end of the bar with grandiose ideas and romanticized visions amid that need (nevermind enjoyment) of the booze. But the film is successful if only because it makes this obsession with the flailing writer Don as his major internal conflict, and that it goes deeper to something that is in many of us, even if we don't drink.Basically, Don wants to get off alcohol so he can write his great book. Despite some advice from the friendly enemy (as I would call one) local bartender, and the girl Gloria, there is little hope for him it seems. He goes on a four-day bender, looking frantically all over the apartment when it's not in easy reach. This all leads up to going clean, which involves a truly paranoid-filmed sequence by Wilder (one of his very best).It is almost all harrowing drama, and only in the minute moments when Don is completely unsympathetic does the film lose some of its momentum. But really, the film is as much about the psychology of this man, of the writer in desperation (though never wanting to admit it), and Ray Milland's performance (at least for the time) was daring enough to show as much as could be shown at the time. The film probes just enough into the subject matter to not become very preachy (I don't think Wilder's message is to never drink ever as much as one of keeping control of one's life and system), and at the core is just entertaining drama.

A factory worker called Big Joe is played by Burt Young.

Jennifer Jason Leigh plays a whore whose timeline for thoughts of her future stretches out only several hours. She gets by in life rolling drunks whose tolerance for liquor is less than hers, or giving sex to those who outlast her. A soldier soon to be shipped out takes her to Manhattan for his last few stateside days and falls in love with her. Tralala (Leigh's character) recognizes the attendant lust but has no clue about the implications of his love. As she sees him off, the Lieutenant hands her an envelope.

And this led me to question. How good is Fight Club? Seeing as how by now there has been several standard reviews of this movie I need not go into what the plot is or how superb the acting, directing, or scriptwriting was, but I think this recent poll and all the internet clamor surrounding this movie leads me to ask another question. Why has Fight Club become such a watershed movie? Fight Club has the interesting distinction of being both underrated and overrated. When it came out it was largely underrated, which is odd since it came under a cloud of criticism for its violent subject matter and it starred two of the biggest Hollywood Stars then as well as now. But this movie really only hit critical mass until it went to Video and DVD. Fight Club found its fan base amongst a lot of adolescent men who pretty much dug the concepts being thrown around. It was philosophical without being over anyone's head, and it was intelligent without being hard to digest. In short it was exactly what it rails against a perfectly portioned package. It is and was a seminal movie that not only struck a chord with a generation of people, but also managed to be damn funny.Fight Club is a great movie, but I do believe it has become a victim of its own success. Now people who watch this movie claim to inhabit it and literally worship the precepts espoused by it, ultimately, missing the whole point of the movie, which is the pursuit of honesty at all cost isn't enough of a sacrifice to truly be free. In the end you're just going to have eat a little crap. If you become obsessed with the fakeness of the world you are just as guilty of making it your master. But of course that interpretation as with others is completely subjective. I wish people could just watch this film and marvel at the story structure and laugh at the humor, because anything else is taking this movie entirely too seriously.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"25 October 2005","score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" I write this review because today I saw that Fight Club was named the 4th best movie of all time in a poll done by a British magazine ( the magazine wasn't named in the AP report). And this led me to question. How good is Fight Club? Seeing as how by now there has been several standard reviews of this movie I need not go into what the plot is or how superb the acting, directing, or scriptwriting was, but I think this recent poll and all the internet clamor surrounding this movie leads me to ask another question. Why has Fight Club become such a watershed movie? Fight Club has the interesting distinction of being both underrated and overrated. When it came out it was largely underrated, which is odd since it came under a cloud of criticism for its violent subject matter and it starred two of the biggest Hollywood Stars then as well as now. But this movie really only hit critical mass until it went to Video and DVD. Fight Club found its fan base amongst a lot of adolescent men who pretty much dug the concepts being thrown around. It was philosophical without being over anyone's head, and it was intelligent without being hard to digest. In short it was exactly what it rails against a perfectly portioned package. It is and was a seminal movie that not only struck a chord with a generation of people, but also managed to be damn funny.Fight Club is a great movie, but I do believe it has become a victim of its own success. Now people who watch this movie claim to inhabit it and literally worship the precepts espoused by it, ultimately, missing the whole point of the movie, which is the pursuit of honesty at all cost isn't enough of a sacrifice to truly be free. In the end you're just going to have eat a little crap. If you become obsessed with the fakeness of the world you are just as guilty of making it your master. But of course that interpretation as with others is completely subjective. I wish people could just watch this film and marvel at the story structure and laugh at the humor, because anything else is taking this movie entirely too seriously.

I also think he was one of the aspects of this movie that held redeeming value. In addition, purchased it new for less than $10 a few years ago, and it is in my Halloween movie collection. With that out of the way, I'll start my review.Vampress Lilith (Angie Everhart) is brought to life again after a long rest in one of the far corners of the world by Reverend Jimmy Current (Chris Sarandon) and his partner Vincent. The two establish a bordello disguised as a funeral home to attract evil local young men. The men can get stiff among the stiffs, but men start disappearing. This disappearance of local young men hits close to home for Katherine Verdoux(Erika Eleniak) when her rebellious younger brother Caleb (Corey Feldman) goes missing. So, she hires a Rafe Guttman (Dennis Miller) a wisecracking, seedy private investigator with good intentions and a quite unusual case--all involving this mortuary with secrets. Rafe and Katherine put themselves into a mystery that crosses the boundary of the living and the dead--rather, the undead.This movie, thought quite funny, is a bad movie. That's just how it is. Going into this movie, the title itself is an indication of how trashy or bad it really is. But man, is it a fun trip! I found myself laughing at pretty much all the right scenes and all the right lines. Its as though the lines are tailored for Miller himself, it is perfect shtick for him. Most of the movies he's been in had parts written especially for him, but this was perfect. My first impression of Rafe is that he's a jerk, but I discovered (rather quickly) that he is rather good-natured and good-intentioned, and that he truly wants to help Katherine out.There are two scenes I absolutely loathed about this movie--the scene where Lilith encounters Rafe in his office (I turn the channel off or fast-forward the tape), and the opening scene of the movie where Lilith is discovered by Rev. Current and Vincent (this is only watchable once). Otherwise, this movie is quite funny and interesting if you plan on getting into it. My biggest beef (spoiler) is that we don't even meet our hero until roughly 20 minutes into the movie! When you're first billed, doesn't this mean you'll show up earlier in the film? I guess someone missed one of the most important parts of film-making, or at least credit order. But, its OK, really, it's not the worst thing about the film.This is essentially a bad movie. I read another review that says that it seems Dennis Miller is letting the viewers know this. He sure is! This is one of those so-bad-it's-funny kind of movies (why it used to be in the horror section of the video store I have no idea). However, Dennis Miller is hysterical in it!! I loved his moments--he had a lot of good ones.I liked when he goes to the Cunningham wake, and watches as the men lift the coffin out of the room, but struggle with it. Guttman, observing the scene, says Wow, she really was a heavyweight. He does make some of the most classically bad facial expressions I have witnessed in a long time (honestly, after seeing this, I want to know what acting school I have to go to just to learn to Act the Dennis Miller Way). My favorite scenes are the Super Soaker scene (I won't divulge on this too much, not to spoil it, but it is a classic scene not to me missed), the scene where he sneaks back into the mortuary to investigate, and when Rafe heads into the coffin drop to visit the Bordello.So why 7 out of 10 stars? One point deducted for the opening scene, which tends to be long and drawn-out. Watch this once, and you'll understand what is going on. What redeems this film is that after this point in the film, it becomes better, and the plot begins to move a little. One the same point, the entire first twenty minutes of the film is a complete drag. Skip the introduction on the next viewing. Another point deducted for the scene where Lilith encounters Rafe in his office--this scene is just a complete turn-off to me (2, 4, 6, 8--You can watch me masturbate!--yuck). And a third point deducted for the nudity. Yes, I know, it's a bordello, yes, they're supposed to be nude. But, I 'm a female, and I don't take pleasure in watching naked women prance around. But, I'm flexible, so I pushed past that dislike and ignored it. The bad acting isn't even a negative--it adds to the movie's silly nature.This is a great Halloween movie, but non-Dennis Miller fans may be turned off by it. Maybe not, I don't know. The acting is pretty bad, but that's the point--it's not Oscar-caliber material. I highly recommend this movie--it has its moments that make is memorable (probably not for all the right reasons, but it tries). Some classic scenes make it funny, and you just may watch it more than once (I have!). Just try not to read too much into it. It really is quite an enjoyable diversion.

This particular movie is not as bad as the next one, a little more entertaining than the 2nd movie, but no where near as good as the original.In this installment, Michael Myers some how survived the fiery blast in the hospital at the end of Halloween 2.

As Michael Myers heads towards town, Dr. Loomis, played once again by Donald Pleasance (You Only Live Twice,) is hot on his heels trying to warn everyone that Myers is on his way.The movie is very clichéd by this point, mostly because by the time this installment of Halloween had been released in 1988 and the last installment of 1981, there had been six Friday the 13th's, four Nightmare on Elm Streets, and one Child's Play. Because of this, there are not a whole of original scares. One of my dislikes in this movie is that, in the first Halloween, you could knock him down, but he would get right back up and come for some more, in the second one I don't think anything happened to him until the end, by this time he was not only getting shot, but hit with rifles in the face, and getting run over by a truck. He went from being a vulnerable but unstoppable psycho to Jason Vorhees, you could nuke him and he would still come after you. Ho-Hum.The movie also borrowed a lot from the original movie in the death scenes, lots of running objects through people. The final scene with Jamie turning on her step-mother and wearing the clown mask that Michael had when he killed his sister, was very predictable, and some what entertaining.I did like both actresses, the young and the old, in the movie. Ellie did a very Jamie Lee Curtis like job as being the vulnerable yet tough girl who is trying to keep Michael away from her sister. Danielle did a good job as the screaming without being annoying victim. For example of annoying see the young girl in the movie Aliens.

Surprisingly he survived for two more bad Halloween sequels and about another 10 movies, but he still did them, but he was done.As always my biggest problem with the movie was the actor who was Michael Myers i.e. The Shape. He was not as menacing as the first movie and this time the mask was not as intimidating as the original mask. The difference between the two would be that in the first movie, the mask was of something else, and now, the mask is an actual Michael Myers mask trying to be the original mask. Not the same. Oh and lets not forget that at the end of the 2nd movie, Laurie had shot both of his eyes out, yet he can see, so in order for this movie to be at all enjoyable you have to forget that fact.Anyway, this movie is very OK.

Bob finally met Dr. Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss), a narcissistic psychiatrist whom he thought could cure his disorder. However, Dr. Marvin is going on vacation and he wont be able to see Bob until a month later. The exciting story begins...From a general viewer's perspective, I thought this movie was very comical; mainly because of Bob's annoying character and his multi-phobias and because my ex-boyfriend has obsessive compulsive disorder. Bill Murray did an excellent job portraying a person who has obsessive compulsive disorder. Although he has multiple phobias, Bob was very lively and seems to be very optimistic about life. He taught Siggy that there's worse fear than death, like Tourette's syndrome. I thought that was straight-up hilarious. However, there's one thing that still confuses me. Is it that easy for someone who has obsessive compulsive disorder to get over his obsessiveness and compulsiveness that quickly? Thus, this leads me to the conclusion that Bob does have obsessive compulsive disorder, but only to a certain extent because it seems like once he finds someone that he trusts, all his fears seem to set aside. Bob needs to be around people; he has the need to connect to people, especially how all his previous doctors neglected him. This shows in the scene where Bob was walking back to the Guttman's house, and he said to himself I'm alone... But it was ironic that Dr. Marvin's family needed Bob in their lives too. being a psychology major, I thought this movie does not depict any truth about psychiatry. First of all, what kind of therapists show fear towards their patients? Well, maybe if the patient is trying to harm his therapist. But in Bob's case, the therapist that was treating Bob before he handed Bob to Dr. Marvin was afraid to continue treating Bob because he wouldn't leave the doctor alone? Another thing I would like to point out is Dr. Marvin's abuse of authority when he put Bob into the institution. In addition, It was wrong of the head of that institution to accept Bob without pre-screening. Furthermore, I thought it was ironic when Dr. Marvin had his manic attack and a colleague of his (Dr. Phil I believe) was going to prescribe him Prozac, then Bob suggested to prescribe Librium instead due to the symptoms that was shown by Dr. Marvin, and Dr. Phil took his advice!?!? Having a nonprofessional prescribing drugs was pretty absurd. This movie stereotyped psychiatrists as people who don't really want to help their patients; they just want to popularize their names and sell their books. Dr. Marvin haven't actually help Bob one bit. He kept referring to his book Baby Steps.Although this movie is a comedy, I still think they need to try to make the movie not too hollywood.

The exciting story begins...From a general viewer's perspective, I thought this movie was very comical; mainly because of Bob's annoying character and his multi-phobias and because my ex-boyfriend has obsessive compulsive disorder. Bill Murray did an excellent job portraying a person who has obsessive compulsive disorder. Although he has multiple phobias, Bob was very lively and seems to be very optimistic about life. He taught Siggy that there's worse fear than death, like Tourette's syndrome. I thought that was straight-up hilarious. However, there's one thing that still confuses me. Is it that easy for someone who has obsessive compulsive disorder to get over his obsessiveness and compulsiveness that quickly? Thus, this leads me to the conclusion that Bob does have obsessive compulsive disorder, but only to a certain extent because it seems like once he finds someone that he trusts, all his fears seem to set aside. Bob needs to be around people; he has the need to connect to people, especially how all his previous doctors neglected him. This shows in the scene where Bob was walking back to the Guttman's house, and he said to himself I'm alone... But it was ironic that Dr. Marvin's family needed Bob in their lives too. being a psychology major, I thought this movie does not depict any truth about psychiatry. First of all, what kind of therapists show fear towards their patients? Well, maybe if the patient is trying to harm his therapist. But in Bob's case, the therapist that was treating Bob before he handed Bob to Dr. Marvin was afraid to continue treating Bob because he wouldn't leave the doctor alone? Another thing I would like to point out is Dr. Marvin's abuse of authority when he put Bob into the institution. In addition, It was wrong of the head of that institution to accept Bob without pre-screening. Furthermore, I thought it was ironic when Dr. Marvin had his manic attack and a colleague of his (Dr. Phil I believe) was going to prescribe him Prozac, then Bob suggested to prescribe Librium instead due to the symptoms that was shown by Dr. Marvin, and Dr. Phil took his advice!?!? Having a nonprofessional prescribing drugs was pretty absurd. This movie stereotyped psychiatrists as people who don't really want to help their patients; they just want to popularize their names and sell their books. Dr. Marvin haven't actually help Bob one bit. He kept referring to his book Baby Steps.Although this movie is a comedy, I still think they need to try to make the movie not too hollywood.

Without going into a rehash of the film itself, I'll simply say that in spite of a big name director, big budget and 'A' list cast, this movie was among the worst Dracula movies ever made. Only a handful of atrocious 'Z' versions of the classic tale fare worse. Why? In a word, 'casting'. To those who thought it a good film, well, we all have our opinions. Having seen virtually every rendition of Dracula put to film, starting with Universal's Bela Lugosi version, this movie reeks. While I think Gary Oldman is a talented actor, he made a pitiful Dracula when in full vampire appearance. Winona Ryder was more irritating than intriguing; Anthony Hopkins turned in a version of Hannibal Lechtor as Van Helsing (even over-acting that persona), and Keanu Reeves (who I think has turned in some good performances in other films) was way out of place in this production. Some of the other supporting players were better, particularly Cary Elwes, Bill Campbell and the oh-so-hot Sadie Frost as Lucy Westenra. I also felt that the special effects were way over the top, and actually detracted from the sinister atmosphere, as good as they appeared on film. To me, this was a squandered opportunity.

When I was growing up in the 1950's, I viewed Newman as sort of a poor man's Marlon Brando. Even his glorious role in Cat On a Hot Tin Roof, I viewed as mainly an attempt to emulate Brando's magnificent performance in A Streetcar Named Desire. I was impressed by his role in Hud, but thought that was due more to the excellent script and direction than to his performance. But with Cool Hand Luke I came to realize what a truly gifted actor Paul Newman is. Like any great actor, Newman actually becomes his character, a nonconformist of a prison community who would rather die than surrender his individuality. He captures the essence of the protagonist who is rebelling against the system or as it was termed in the 1960's, the establishment. Without Newman this film would have gone nowhere, not even with the brilliant performances of the rest of the cast, especially those of Strother Martin, George Kennedy, J.D. Cannon, and Jo Van Fleet.Though Strother Martin is most remembered for what became a catchphrase in the counterculture movement, What we have here is a failure to communicate, I like the line he throws at Luke when they first encounter each other, Cuttin' heads off parking meters! Just where'd you think that was going to get you? because that line epitomizes the diametrically opposed personalities of a Hitler-type authoritarian monster who appears harmless to the naked eye and that of a rebel who is determined to crush tyranny in any form that threatens the freedom of mankind. This tension and antagonism is also central to another movie classic, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, based on a novel written during the same time period, where we discover it between McMurphy and Nurse Ratched. This is indeed high drama and it takes the likes of Paul Newman and Jack Nicholson to pull it off.

When I was growing up in the 1950's, I viewed Newman as sort of a poor man's Marlon Brando. Even his glorious role in Cat On a Hot Tin Roof, I viewed as mainly an attempt to emulate Brando's magnificent performance in A Streetcar Named Desire. I was impressed by his role in Hud, but thought that was due more to the excellent script and direction than to his performance. But with Cool Hand Luke I came to realize what a truly gifted actor Paul Newman is. Like any great actor, Newman actually becomes his character, a nonconformist of a prison community who would rather die than surrender his individuality. He captures the essence of the protagonist who is rebelling against the system or as it was termed in the 1960's, the establishment.
