Ms. Shields, you're broadcasting on an electromagnetic frequency that the robot reads.Its terrific techno-babble punking like this that makes this movie endlessly watchable. Let me just say that this isn't a 4 star movie. Unless they give stars for cheese. Its got that enticing Roadhouse quality that never gets old. So, if you're still reading this, you know you could go to 100 reviews and find plot details and the same-ole run down on all the fixings; so allow me to offer you my observations.Runaway was made at a time when we were still a bit in awe of the possible tech-future. This now defunct movie premise allowed for imaginations to run wild and present silly adventures that future generations could pick apart and laugh at (think now). So here we go1. Why is there a special police force to chase down robots run amok ? Something tells me it wouldn't be a tough talking take no prisoners macho man like our good friend Ramsay. The first assignment is SO urgent, it requires our team to fly to the site in a helicopter so they can flip a switch on a caterpillar catcher. Um&#133;OK. Great ! You've saved dozens of corn stalks !2. Ramsay's partner, Karen, as a cop, wears a skirt and high heels. Just think about the absurdity of chasing down a perp in that get up.3. I love the security guard in the office building who, for some inexplicable reason, knows about everything there is to know about their computer systems, down to the voice modifications on the computer system (he's not the I.T. guy, he's a security guard), then goes so far as to bust Ramsay's onions on police protocol. Something tells me a security guard wouldn't be getting in a cop's grill. I mean&#133;he is the security guard ! Plus, (I know..beating a dead horse), why do they need that guy, if robots are doing all these kind of jobs in the future ? 4. And while we're on the subject, what kind of future were these guys envisioning when a robotic office sentry runs through the office with a zapping ray gun ? Talk about big brother&#133; 5. Also, notice when Kirstie Alley expires at the restaurant, no one notices that she is thrown face down in the pool. They just keep eating !? 6. Plus, the scenes between Selleck and his child are cringeworthy. Gene Simmons actually does a good job to not defile himself, however, I wish just once, during one of his close ups, he would break his ominous stare and stick his freakish tongue way out. Despite all this, it's an enjoyable 90 minutes. Tom Selleck, Cynthia Rhodes and the rest do an admirable job in spite of the lame dialogue and foolish direction. The 1990s brought about a heavy dose of cynicism and we partially lost the fun in imagining what the future holds. Think about Escape from New York, the Terminator, Blade Runner, etc. They all asked us to think about the future. When done right, it can be very entertaining (Minority Report).

No. Is it the worst film ever made? No. I first saw the movie at the cinema upon its release and, at that time, I did think that it was one of the worst films I'd seen up to that point. I've watched it 2 or 3 times since then and my opinion of it has improved, well, very slightly at any rate. Apart from a pervading incoherence, I think the film's major problem is its slightness; it's only an hour and a half long and the plot is very simplistic to say the least. It's not hard to imagine audiences feeling a bit short-changed when it first came out, especially as the film was a big-budget, would-be summer blockbuster. Another big problem is the casting of Uma Thurman as Emma Peel. Thurman has shown herself to be a fine actress in movies such as Pulp Fiction but she just looks out of her depth here (I never believed in her as a top-level scientist for a second) and her English accent doesn't sound natural. Nicole Kidman, to whom the role was first offered, would surely have been better, in particular, she's displayed flawless English accents in films such as The Others and The Hours. An English actress I also think would have made a great Peel is Joely Richardson but the studio would probably have vetoed such a choice on the grounds of her not being a big enough name. Ralph Fiennes was a real enigma in this film - there was nothing wrong in principle in casting him as Steed but he looks ill at ease throughout the movie as if he'd rather be elsewhere. I can only assume he'd already twigged that the film was going to be a turkey. What's worse, Fiennes and Thurman have absolutely no chemistry between them, which wastes the snappy dialogue they have with each other throughout the film. The supporting cast fare a bit better with seasoned pros such as Sean Connery, Jim Broadbent and Fiona Shaw making the most of their underdeveloped parts. The retro-chic world of the original TV series is nicely recreated and there's no shortage of nice cars, costumes and locations but what's good about the film is easily drowned out by what's bad; The Avengers is ultimately a shallow, rushed and messy affair, severely hampered by the performances of its two leads. Handled properly, the film could have been a wonderful success for all concerned, the first chapter of an entertaining and lucrative franchise, stretching well beyond the 1990s; instead it's one of the most embarrassing flops of that decade. The original cut of the film was apparently two and a half hours long but, following negative reactions from audiences at test screenings, the studio hacked the film down to its present one and a half hour length. This doesn't actually come as much of a surprise as there is a lack of proper narrative flow to the film suggestive of chunks of explanatory scenes having been cut out. Just one example towards the end of the film, just before they enter Sir August's underwater lair, Steed and Peel enter a phone box and Peel says how now brown cow? down the phone. The phrase seems to be a password to enter the premises but how does Peel know it? There's been talk here and there of the possibility of Warners releasing a director's cut or special edition DVD, restoring the original two and a half hour version. I think this would be a good idea and I'd definitely be interested in watching the full version of the film. It's highly unlikely to be any kind of masterpiece but it's difficult to imagine that it wouldn't improve upon the movie as it stands. At the very least you'd have to assume that it would be more coherent. Sadly I don't think the chances of Warners going down this line are high; I have the feeling that this is a movie the studio would rather forget about than draw attention to.

It's not hard to imagine audiences feeling a bit short-changed when it first came out, especially as the film was a big-budget, would-be summer blockbuster. Another big problem is the casting of Uma Thurman as Emma Peel. Thurman has shown herself to be a fine actress in movies such as Pulp Fiction but she just looks out of her depth here (I never believed in her as a top-level scientist for a second) and her English accent doesn't sound natural. Nicole Kidman, to whom the role was first offered, would surely have been better, in particular, she's displayed flawless English accents in films such as The Others and The Hours. An English actress I also think would have made a great Peel is Joely Richardson but the studio would probably have vetoed such a choice on the grounds of her not being a big enough name. Ralph Fiennes was a real enigma in this film - there was nothing wrong in principle in casting him as Steed but he looks ill at ease throughout the movie as if he'd rather be elsewhere. I can only assume he'd already twigged that the film was going to be a turkey. What's worse, Fiennes and Thurman have absolutely no chemistry between them, which wastes the snappy dialogue they have with each other throughout the film. The supporting cast fare a bit better with seasoned pros such as Sean Connery, Jim Broadbent and Fiona Shaw making the most of their underdeveloped parts. The retro-chic world of the original TV series is nicely recreated and there's no shortage of nice cars, costumes and locations but what's good about the film is easily drowned out by what's bad; The Avengers is ultimately a shallow, rushed and messy affair, severely hampered by the performances of its two leads. Handled properly, the film could have been a wonderful success for all concerned, the first chapter of an entertaining and lucrative franchise, stretching well beyond the 1990s; instead it's one of the most embarrassing flops of that decade. The original cut of the film was apparently two and a half hours long but, following negative reactions from audiences at test screenings, the studio hacked the film down to its present one and a half hour length. This doesn't actually come as much of a surprise as there is a lack of proper narrative flow to the film suggestive of chunks of explanatory scenes having been cut out. Just one example towards the end of the film, just before they enter Sir August's underwater lair, Steed and Peel enter a phone box and Peel says how now brown cow? down the phone. The phrase seems to be a password to enter the premises but how does Peel know it? There's been talk here and there of the possibility of Warners releasing a director's cut or special edition DVD, restoring the original two and a half hour version. I think this would be a good idea and I'd definitely be interested in watching the full version of the film. It's highly unlikely to be any kind of masterpiece but it's difficult to imagine that it wouldn't improve upon the movie as it stands. At the very least you'd have to assume that it would be more coherent. Sadly I don't think the chances of Warners going down this line are high; I have the feeling that this is a movie the studio would rather forget about than draw attention to.

However, what the scientists who created them didn't count on is the evolution of the machines post man's control, and this is proving a problem for Colonel Hendricksson, as it's not easy to tell the difference between people and machines anymore...Christian Duguay evidently decided that it would be a good idea to play it safe with the lead star and opted to cast Peter Weller, who had been tried and tested in futuristic actioners almost a decade earlier with Paul Verhoeven's Robocop. Weller makes for a good B-movie lead as although he's no Arnold Schwarzenegger; he looks strong and knows his way around an action scene. However, for me he's a weak link in an otherwise strong film, as he doesn't look interesting enough and has a hard time when it comes to the emotional scenes.

The story sounded intriguing, a Colonel who makes a deadly friendly fire error of his own during Desert Storm, and is later called upon to determine the worthiness of a female helicopter pilot to be posthumously awarded the Medal of Honour. Her surviving troops each give a different depiction of the relevant combat events.However, be forewarned. Take the R language rating very seriously here. The movie seems attempting to set a record for use of the f-word and anti religion profanity, both alone and in sacrilegious combination. For those not comfortable with such language, this movie is not for you. The female chopper pilot, Captain Walden, may or may not prove as combat worthy as the boys, but she certainly proves that she's as foul mouthed. Presumably language used during tense combat situations isn't the best. However, isn't it amazing all the great war movies from bygone years that managed just fine without this sort of dialogue? By the way, the objectionable language is EVERYWHERE, not only during the battle sequences.

One object or friend takes one's fancy for some reason for a little while, then another. Pace and cinematic tempo must reflect that which may look a mish-mash to adult viewer's eyes.The film basically just follows a bright, attentive young girl's life over a number of days,events being magnified or diminished just as they are as a girl records her diary highlights, or tells you the essential summary of what happened at school at the end of a day when you pick them up to take home. Seeing a drunk in the street may loom large, or the latest hip item of local kids clothing to be seen in.Many of these daily events don't necessarily have a further deep meaning, a filmistic solution or termination--the half-sculpted and wonky images of a day's life just end hanging,(or disappearing) into thin air.Matt Groening recently commented (admiitedly speaking about the different genre of adult comedy)in a UK interview that he felt that US audiences needed to be hit with a sledgehammer to produce an adequate comic effect and he would sometimes love to produce comedy with the subtlety acceptable to overseas audiences. I don't want to inflame any transatlantic passions, but is it possible that US audiences are just not able to handle stories such as the running of a child's mind that doesn't necessarily have a beginning, a middle, or an end? What if you just sat in the film and took in the experience---no punchline, only feeling and seeing...But young girls have bigger dreams and special loves---and there is (for many) nothing more special than the daughter's adoration, showoffiness,and special love for---their FATHER. It may extend to magnification of Dad to almost superhuman proportions---in this case, Dad is a classical flautist, and the dreaminess about her suave, charming, European, traveled father creates a delightful loving giant edifice of her father in her eyes, who creates special flute wandering leitmotifs to lull her to sleep, and informs her life with love. In reality, there is no fluff in here at all. I became (blessedly) a father to identical girl twins well after seeing this movie--and the relationship I have with my girls was perhaps more accurately portrayed here than in any other resonance or description I've encountered. The special tenderness of love for a father's daughter, and when young, this special inexplicable bond, mutually returned, is beyond 25 words or less--but Coppola has sensed this, no doubt especially helping to create this reciprocal magic by employing Sofia in the filmic role of the daughter--at this age and stage of Zoe's tender life, although her early cinematic ability is undoubted and has since been proved, I would judge being employed firstly as being the real daughter and distant secondly, as an actress.And in my view, he and she have both sensed this, and made a good filmic depiction of it. There is great depth of love mingled with total child's whimsy-quite a tough mix to encompass in a film short.Although I hinted this paediatric Ulysses (a day in the life of...little girl X), as a child thinks, doesn't have beginnings, middles or ends, the adoration of young Zoe, mingled with all her other dreams, is crafted into an aesthetically stunning (?how real?) climax of her father's achievement as a musician when he is lead flautist at an orchestral performance in the open air at the foot of the Acropolis, commencing at dusk---just one of these stunning, life lasting images that Coppola has this ability to produce. Perfectly timed, with kids in the select audience, father stands up and plays--and the repertoire drifts as thrilled Sofia's mind hears him playing(at least to her ears)---the special children's music he plays to her when they are together putting her to sleep---my memory may be wrong, but I think it is is a rearrangement into multiple rather simple chord inversions and hence variations of 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star'---but to Sofia, it is a classical triumph- a peak moment in a girl's pride in her father and an orchestral triumph of course of the highest order.

This is a film in which the main drive is using the characters to tell the story. Maya Angelou takes her time to let the particulars of this tale fall into place and in the meantime creates vivid characters that grow and learn valuable lessons in life and eventually become different people during the film's running time. Alfre Woodard is the best black actress in film period, and like many other great actors or actresses she gets the shaft every awards season in favor of more mainstream actresses or ones with greater sex appeal. This film is yet another in a long line of snubbed movies that lend validity to the ever-growing fact that the Oscars are a joke, a sham, and have degraded into a downright trivial affair. The story of a family embracing their roots and making a good life outside the city is an incredibly reassuring one, but the real narrative gem of this film is the poignant and gradually revealed story of Nathan, which makes us wonder that it wasn't that long ago when the value of human life was less than that of an material object. This film deals with the ugly truth of slavery in the simplest of ways yet I found this one plot thread more compelling than the entire 156 minute running time of Amistad. Maya Angelou should direct more films in the future. Perhaps that would in some way elevate the pathetic lows cinema has reached in recent years.

This is a film in which the main drive is using the characters to tell the story. Maya Angelou takes her time to let the particulars of this tale fall into place and in the meantime creates vivid characters that grow and learn valuable lessons in life and eventually become different people during the film's running time. Alfre Woodard is the best black actress in film period, and like many other great actors or actresses she gets the shaft every awards season in favor of more mainstream actresses or ones with greater sex appeal. This film is yet another in a long line of snubbed movies that lend validity to the ever-growing fact that the Oscars are a joke, a sham, and have degraded into a downright trivial affair. The story of a family embracing their roots and making a good life outside the city is an incredibly reassuring one, but the real narrative gem of this film is the poignant and gradually revealed story of Nathan, which makes us wonder that it wasn't that long ago when the value of human life was less than that of an material object. This film deals with the ugly truth of slavery in the simplest of ways yet I found this one plot thread more compelling than the entire 156 minute running time of Amistad. Maya Angelou should direct more films in the future. Perhaps that would in some way elevate the pathetic lows cinema has reached in recent years. By contrast Americanos shows us how some thing never change. Police will always associate Latinos with gangs, and Latinos will always argue over being lumped into any category, especially Latinos. This documentary shows us that there is such wide diversity within this ethnic group that how could anyone dare to call them by the same name? People represented in this film are all to happy to challenge stereotypes like the boarder patrol officer, or take them to new, interesting, and most of all challenging heights like those at the living art exhibit. All in all the message here is the same as in Get on the Bus These are not Latinos, Hispanics, or all Mexicans. They are people as different from us as they are from each other, but first and foremost they are human beings, as are we all.

A man with a good marriage and family can't resist his sexual ego and jeopardizes everything for what he thinks will be a one night fling--instead he tangles with a woman who has gone over the brink from one too many experiences of being used. I don't think she was so obsessed with him per se, but lost her reason because she simply wasn't going to be used and discarded AGAIN. I'm one of the few people who doesn't believe the Alex character was pregnant. I think that was part of her delusion--something she wanted to be true because she was in her late 30's, unmarried, and no potential spouse and child on the foreseeable horizon. The script gives the audience next to nothing to work with about Alex's past and what happened with other men that turns her into a stalker with Dan. But how many women are satisfied being treated as disposable sex objects? Another part of her delusion was thinking she could have a real relationship with someone married; or that he would automatically leave his wife if she said she was pregnant. The movie doesn't tell us what will happen to Dan & Beth's marriage, but after everything Beth went through because of what her husband did, I just can't see them returning to their ideal family in the country setting again. I see Beth kicking Dan's butt out of the door.Ann Archer as Beth puts in one of her best performances ever. She goes from sweet wife and mother through sheer terror until she puts an end to the threat to her whole way of life. But I think it was love for and protection of her child, rather than love for her husband, that gave her the strength to fight back. Michael Douglas as Dan goes from cocky and self-satisfied at the beginning to whiny and pathetic at the end. There's no sympathy for his egotism that caused the whole mess to happen.

Christine is one of the best movie... things (would she be considered a monster or demon?), and is pure evil and she kills anybody who crosses her by running them down. She's a literal version of hell on wheels, and is cool. I like the soundtrack to it, which is full of 80's rock which fits the moment. Arnie is a good character and fits the typical nerd in school who ends up getting revenge through Christine. The book, however, reveals him to be possessed by Roland D. LeBay (a.k.a. the old guy who sold him Christine). I read the book, and I like both the book and movie, but in typical fashion, the book was better. However, I think there should be a sequel to Christine (Spoiler approaching), since after they destroyed her and a piece of her was moving at the end. Also, the book ends where there was a report in the newspaper of a hit and run by a mysterious car, and the person that was killed was supposedly one of the guys who trashed Christine.Other than straying from the possession of Arnie part of the book, Christine is a good movie.

Tarantula is about a Professor named Gerald Deemer (Leo G. Carroll) who is working on a nutrient that causes animals to grow large. A radioactive isotope is what holds the nutrient together & triggers it.

This Tarantula grows bigger & bigger from the injections which included the radioactive isotope which is what makes the tarantula so big. It ends up getting 100 Feet Tall & terrorizes the Arizona Country Side. Dr. Matt Hastings (John Agar) famous for 50's & 60's B Sci-Fi Films like (Revenge Of The Creature '55, The Mole People '56, Daughter Of Dr. Jekyll '57, The Brain From Planet Arous '57, Attack Of The Puppet People '58, Invisible Invaders '59, Hand Of Death '62, Journey To The Seventh Planet '62, Women Of The Prehistoric Planet '66, Zontar, The Thing From Venus '66 (Remake) (TV) & Curse Of The Swamp Creature '66 (TV).) eventually finds out about the tarantula having visiting local farmers with The Sheriff Jack Andrews (Nestor Paiva) with Cattle stripped down to the bone & puddles of white liquid which is the Tarantula's Venom.
