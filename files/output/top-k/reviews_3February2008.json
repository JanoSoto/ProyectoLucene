Returning to it now I see that it wasn't just my youthful innocence that made this seem like a great movie -- it really is a powerful piece of cinema, full of complex characters, intense drama and thrilling suspense.Maybe it's just a coincidence because one of the other films I remember seeing at a young age was Cool Hand Luke but this movie does remind me of that classic, especially the masculine camaraderie in the locker room and the whole sequence with betting (in Luke on the egg-eating contest and in Pebbles on the boxing match). Not saying it's a bad thing, just taking note of maybe a style of the times. These are both films that James Dean could have appeared in if he had lived -- they tap into the same rebel without a cause vibe that became so much more pervasive after his death. McQueen is fantastic though, just as good as Dean would have been. There's a quality of hesitation, fear of getting too close to others or revealing too much about himself, in his performance that I find very effective.The story does get a little bit predictable (who out there didn't already know the missionaries would refuse to leave China?) but it's a very effective drama. The most intense part of the movie for me is the character of Po-Han, played by Mako. His friendship with Holman (Steve McQueen) and his tragic death are really effective, a way of showing us how Holman opens up his soul to others only to have it crushed and thrown back at him by the forces of nature.I think this is very much an anti-establishment film but it sends its messages in relatively subtle ways, not through speeches or dialog but just through the relationships between the characters. First of all there's a cumulative effect to watching the absolutely pig-headed way that some of the sailors (particularly the ones played by two of my favorite character actors, Simon Oakland and Joe Turkel) treat the Chinese. In the early parts of the film Holman uses racist slang and goes to that place they like to go with the rest of them, and he never gives a speech to tell us that his attitude has changed but we can see it in the way he treats Maily (Emmanuel Arsan) and Frenchy (Richard Attenborough). To see that more we could contrast Holman's friendship with Po-Han with his antagonistic relationship with Captain Collins (Richard Crena). At the beginning of the film Collins says that Holman has good marks on his service record -- in everything but leadership. He forces Holman to train Po-Han because he does not want his sailors to do manual labor; he wants the Chinese to do it all. Everything about Collins is status quo, don't rock the boat. Crenna's performance is magnificent, particularly after the diplomatic\/military situation deteriorates and the pressure mounts. Starting with Po-Han's death, Collins reveals a self-destructive inability to take the necessary course of action coupled with an unreasonable pride that takes precedence over every sane and decent impulse and leads him into a battle that he did not need to fight. In every case, from Po-Han to the rescue of the missionaries, it's finally up to Holman to take real action. To me that says something about the message of the movie -- Collins is more concerned with honor and duty than with really helping the Chinese people. The things that the missionaries say about the imperialists ring true to how we've seen him act in the film. He's not an absolute pig like Simon Oakland's character, but maybe he's even more dangerous.I'd like to point out before I run out of space the extreme technical quality of this film. Wise was always a good director with good material and this was his last really great film IMHO. Photographer MacDonald also did some of his best work here -- this film just cries out to be seen in 70mm. I love how he photographed Crenna against that stark red white and blue background when he gives his big speech. And Jerry Goldsmith's music is really some of his best here as well, enabling the film to shift from its more romantic and sentimental episodes to the sweeping action with ease.I'd also like to praise the acting in general. I'd love to see Candice Bergen in more roles like this. A lot of times the romantic aspects of a film come off as fluff but she really held up her side of the film; you can really believe that she's an essentially good person though perhaps a bit sheltered or naive, that she thinks she knows how to help the Chinese people but unlike her mentor she doesn't judge others. Also the film is full of top character actors, like Oakland and Turkel plus also James Hong as an underworld type, Attenborough's tragic sailor in love, Mako's self-conscious and intelligent Po-Han, Charles Robinson's enthusiastic young ensign. Every performer was perfectly cast and along with Wise they created memorable characters both big and small.I'm so glad I watched it again; it's an emotional film that earns the emotions it asks us to feel and pays off on them with a heartfelt but subtle message of pacifism, of human decency and love winning over ignorance and pride. I wouldn't hesitate to say it's a great film.

It is not a real scenic film as all the action in the film takes place in three rooms.The living room with a huge window to the outside world is where the main action takes place. Hitch himself does not appear in this stage but there is a florescent sign of his image on a building in the obviously artificial back drop. He does walk down the street during the opening credits too.The play has gay overtones which do show up in the film but are toned down for in 1948 this type of theme was solidly in the closet. For a long time films would treat this line, even 11 years later there are those themes in Ben Hur but toned down there too.The innovation is the shooting technique. This is the only time a great film was made with long (8 minutes or more) continuous takes. There is one sequence in the film where you see the camera shake. That is because a camera man just had the camera run over & broke his foot. The brave camera man still worked broken foot & all to finish the sequence and did not holler out with pain.Jimmy Stewart is uncomfortable in his role but it actually fits the story. Hitchcock leaves no mystery about who the killers are as the murder happens the first thing after the credits. It is supposed to be the perfect victim and the perfect murder. It is fascinating to watch all this unravel with Professor Stewart the only person who can solve it.While this movie did not sell the tickets that Rear Window would later, it a way this film is the perfect mirror of that film. This one looks into the intimate details of the murder from outside where Rear Window looks outside to see the details of the perfect murder.

Picard, who had been ordered to stand down, doesn't accept this and follows the enemy with his crew in tow.I hate to say it, but this is one of the more pointless Trek films. I loved The Next Generation and I'd watch a film with the cast no matter how awful or stupid it was. So I enjoyed this one, as well. But generally speaking, it is just full of questionable situations and seemed more like a desire to cash in than any serious attempt to provide the fans with something substantial.After the series ended and we had Generations, the time travel idea is really played out. The only reason to add it here is to tell a story about how man met Vulcans. But it's really better to do this in a prequel or something. Adding Riker and Troi to a crucial moment in history just seems to cheapen it for me. Why can't it happen without such big names involved? And I didn't care for the character of the the warp drive inventor (I love James Cromwell, but this was not a great role). And the Steppenwolf? Over a century later? Very out of sync with the series.The Borg revisionism was questionable, too. We have the Borg Queen inserted into the Locutus story, which she wasn't in originally. Her character in general is interesting but takes away from the concept of the Borg race. At least for me it does. The Borg, aside from Q, are probably the most interesting species on The Next Generation but I didn't think their presentation here was true to their being.Lastly, I was mixed on how to feel about Data being made more human. I understand we have to continue down the path of making him more and more like a human (adding knowledge first, then emotions and now pain). But it seemed so forced. Each film in the series has'a subplot of Data getting more human. Why so fast?

I liked it quite a bit, and as I said I'm always ready to see the crew together again. I just got the impression this was a weak film. Generations was superior, as were many of the episodes.

Although many suitors beg for Bianca's hand, her widowed father is determined that she may not marry until her elder sister Katherine is wed--and Katherine is a hot tempered, willful, and vicious woman who makes life miserable for all who cross her path. Fortunately for Bianca, Petruchio is in need of money, and he is more than willing to marry Kate, no matter how resistant Kate herself is to the whole idea.Shakespeare's original script has been trimmed here and there, and while purists may scream about it the result not only works for film, it also manages to capture the flavor of Shakespeare's language much better than any other film version of SHREW both before or since. And the look of the thing is beautiful Zeffirelli brings his mastery of opera's larger than life visuals to bear upon the project, and the result is eye-popping production values, most particularly in reference to the costuming. Every cent spent shows on the screen.Although she was a very fine screen actress, Elizabeth Taylor is not a name one would expect to find playing Shakespeare--but she carries it off in fine style, kicking, snapping, and snarling with tremendous panache in the first portion of the film, and then making Kate's taming seem entirely plausible in the latter portion. Unlike many later Shakespeare plays, SHREW is not greatly noted for its language; even so, Katherine's final speech is widely known and extremely memorable, and Taylor pulls it off with such credibility that one wishes she had done other classical roles as well.Taylor's then-husband Richard Burton co-stars as the deliberately uncouth Petruchio, who sets out to tame a shrew and finds himself as much tamed by her as she by him. Burton, of course, was accustomed to the classics in general and Shakespeare in particular, and he plays with tremendous bravado. The supporting cast, which includes a young Michael York, is also very fine, and when all is said and done the 1964 THE TAMING OF THE SHREW is a tremendous amount of fun even if you don't like Shakespeare.The DVD transfer is very nice. The picture has the occasional blemish, most often in the opening titles and closing credits, but on the whole it is remarkable, showing every detail of every set and every costume to fine effect.

In the case of BLOW UP, which is easily Antonioni's best English-language film, the unresolved story is one of a possible murder captured by accident on film; the themes involved are those of reality, illusion, and the distractions that prevent us from seeing the difference between the two.Thomas (David Hemmings) is an obnoxious, self-centered London photographer who alternates between fashion and art photography. In search of a tranquil subject to counterpoint an otherwise dark collection of photographs, he takes several photographs of a couple in an otherwise empty park---and is unconcerned when the woman (Vanessa Redgrave) pursues him to his to studio to demand the negatives. Thomas agrees to give them to her, but secretly switches rolls of film; later, when he develops the photographs, he is startled to find he may have photographed a murder.The film is perhaps most memorable for its disturbing sense of irony. Near the beginning of the film Thomas is plagued by two would-be models; he escapes them by visiting an antique shop and then wanders into the nearby park. As the film progresses, he finds his meeting with the unwillingly-photographed woman interrupted by the delivery of a purchase he made at that antique shop; still later, and now aroused by the mysterious woman, he is once more visited by the would-be models and has sex with them---an incident that delays his inspection of the photographs and effectively derails him from receiving assistance from various friends who are now themselves distracted by sex and drugs. Each detail coils back upon itself in a series of frustrating interruptions, driving Thomas in directions that repeatedly delay any action he might take that could answer his questions, much less solve the riddle.The greatest irony is that we are watching pictures of a photographer taking pictures, and indeed much of the film involves looking at pictures of pictures of pictures without any clear indication of whether or not anything we see is actually real---which is, of course, exactly the nature of the illusion a movie creates. That said, if you come to film expecting a murder mystery with a neatly explained solution, you are in for a rude shock BLOW UP is not about plot; it is about how difficult it is to know anything factual from a medium that is intrinsically illusionary in the first place. Not only is the nature of film as a medium the movie's greatest irony, it is also probably it's ultimate statement.BLOW UP really is a film that tends to jack people's jaws all over the place, partly because it defeats their expectations in terms of character and plot, but more specifically because it is so open-ended that you can pretty much impose any meaning upon it that you like. Was there a man with a gun---or was it just a trick of the light? Was there a murder---or was it something else? And if so, what? And what does it all mean at the end? But there are no fixed meanings in the film at all, and if you want a strong storyline with clear-cut ideas, well, you're out of luck here. So no, BLOW UP isn't a film for every one. It will most greatly appeal to people with a fondness for European cinema and art movies.The DVD presently available is at best acceptable; it would be really nice to see this film given the royal treatment by a company such as Criterion.

With his background on Broadway, Minelli knew more than simply super choreography (like his predecessor of the 1930s, Busby Berkeley) but how to frame his shots, and create memorable performances from his actors. His best musical is hard to choose, but it is among these films Meet Me In St. Louis, An American In Paris, Gigi, The Band Wagon (and this overlooks such interesting works as Yolanda And The Thief, The Pirate, Brigadoon, and In The Good Old Summertime). Minelli was not afraid to take chances if he knew he had the staff to carry it off. When he made An American In Paris he had the right staff.Movies about or dealing with ballet had been around for decades. These included melodramas like The Mad Genius with John Barrymore and Donald Cook (supposedly suggested by a twisted view of the relations between Diaghilev and Nijinski) and The Spectre Of The Rose, and then the British masterpiece The Red Shoes. The latter film had shown one could make a compelling movie about the ballet including a complete ballet sequence. There had been films with ballet - type sequences in American musicals, the most notable being Minelli's own film with Kelly, The Pirate (when they show the pirate Macoco's sack of a city), and in the musical Words and Music about Rodgers and Hart, where Kelly did Slaughter On Tenth Avenue. But the latter was actually based on a ballet from the Rodgers and Hart musical On Your Toes, and the sequence in The Pirate is a piece of imagination of how Kelly (pretending to be Macoco) envisions himself as that legendary pirate. The concluding ballet in An American In Paris is an integral part of the story, summarizing the emotional agony that Kelly's Jerry Mulligan is facing at that moment by the loss of his girlfriend Lisa Bouvier (Leslie Caron).An American In Paris has a simple story line - Kelly is an ex-GI who stayed in France to study art, and who lives near his friend Adam Cook (Oscar Levant), a pianist\/composer studying music in Paris. Kelly meets a wealthy woman (Milo Roberts - Nina Foch) who offers patronage assistance, but only if Kelly considers having a serious romantic affair with her. While trying to maintain his self-respect despite Foch's enticing offers, Kelly sees Caron at a nightclub, and tries to attract her attention. He does not know that she is the fiancé of another friend of his and Levant, the entertainer (Henri Baurel - Georges Guetery), and she is hesitant about seeing him, but gradually falls to his charms and loves him. But she is loyal to Guetery, and will not stop plans for marrying him, despite Kelly's feelings. As he sees them drive off, he imagines the An American In Paris ballet sequence. Minelli pulled out all his artistic ideas here (with Kelly's assistance) basing the various settings and characters on impressionist artists of the late 19th Century (in fact, in the Moulin Rouge section you can see a diminutive Toulouse Lautrec seated at a table). The film uses plenty of Gershwin tunes, besides the An American In Paris. I've Got Rhythm, 'Swonderful!, By Strauss, and other tunes pop up, including Guetery doing a show-stopper, I'll Build a Stairway to Paradise One of the curious ironies of the film, by the way, is that Guetery never made any other American movie after this. He had been in films in France since 1938, and should have had a longer career in our films too, but - unlike Maurice Chevalier or Charles Boyer - stayed in France. In the long run it did no harm to him - his recordings of tunes and stage work made him a millionaire success in France before his death in 1997.Levant too does well, playing his caustic, smarter-than-the-hero type. His show-stopper is a three or four minute spot where he sees himself giving a concerto performance in a concert hall, where all the musicians (including the conductor, the drummer, the string section) are himself. It turns out the audience also includes him. If not thoroughly original (Buster Keaton did a short like this in the 1920s), it is well done, especially when we see Levant's handling of the keyboard. His witty repartee and neurotic problems aside, people tend to forget that Levant was a highly gifted pianist, and a close friend (and interpreter) of George Gershwin. As for his repartee, his best line is when he quietly deflates Nina Foch at a party towards the end of the film.Leslie Caron had been seen in a production in France by Kelly, who suggested her for his dancing partner in the ballet as a result. Her gamin like qualities showed through, leading to her later 1950s successes in Lili and Gigi. But her best moments here are in the ballet, dancing well with Kelly - he as a boulevardier type and she as a fashionable young woman. Later they both change costumes to fit the styles of the different painters the sets mirror.An American In Paris became the first musical film to win the Oscar for best picture. Minelli would repeat this success (with Caron) seven years later with Gigi. As for Kelly, his interest in ballet based movies would reach it's high point a few years later with his Invitation To The Dance.

As for his repartee, his best line is when he quietly deflates Nina Foch at a party towards the end of the film.Leslie Caron had been seen in a production in France by Kelly, who suggested her for his dancing partner in the ballet as a result. Her gamin like qualities showed through, leading to her later 1950s successes in Lili and Gigi. But her best moments here are in the ballet, dancing well with Kelly - he as a boulevardier type and she as a fashionable young woman. Later they both change costumes to fit the styles of the different painters the sets mirror.An American In Paris became the first musical film to win the Oscar for best picture. Minelli would repeat this success (with Caron) seven years later with Gigi. As for Kelly, his interest in ballet based movies would reach it's high point a few years later with his Invitation To The Dance.

To a certain extent, this reaction was based on the film's slightly abstract, extremely operatic visual style--a style which seemed to overpower not only the actors but the actual story itself.Dracula has a spectacular visual design that mixes ideas about Victorian style with flamboyant color and ornate, border-line baroque detail that seems more suited to an Asian stage play than a film presumably set in 1890s England. The cinematography follows suit, using double and triple exposures, shared screen photography, and intense washes of color. The result is tremendously moody, both beautiful and ominous. It is also extremely distracting, and it tends to bury the actors, script, and story to such an extent that the film becomes less about these elements than about the mood and look inflicted upon them.At the time it was released, Dracula was touted as the first film version that was faithful to the 1897 novel by Bram Stoker--but this is not true, as any one who has read the novel can attest. The film has been deeply influenced by the Bela Lugosi film, the Boris Karloff THE MUMMY, and the Hammer Horror vampire films of the 1960s; it explains how Dracula became a vampire, incorporates dollops of reincarnation, includes a very romantic subplot, and presents us with an ultimately sexy vampire--none of which exist in Stoker's novel. There is also considerable sex, and while this is a part of the original novel its power there arises from its subtextual nature; here it is rendered explicit and consequently seems less powerful than merely commonplace. Even so, the core story of Dracula's transition from Transylvannia to England, his attacks on Lucy and Mina, and his ultimate destruction remains much the same.The casting of Gary Oldman as Dracula and Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing was a stroke of genius, but sad to say the production-heavy nature of the film doesn't allow them the necessary wiggle-room necessary to create the memorable performances you would expect. Winona Ryder seems very aptly cast as Mina, as does Sadie Frost as Lucy--but the script undercuts both, leaving Mina slightly chilly and Lucy excessively overheated. As for the eternally wooden Keanu Reeves, he lives up to his reputation as one of the least interesting actors of the era, delivering a memorably wooden performance.When the film delivers, it does so memorably, with the scene in which Lucy is laid to rest for once and all a case in point. But overall, BRAM STOKER'S Dracula is not Bram Stoker, nor is it actually a cohesive variation it simply a particularly exotic vision forced upon a story that doesn't support it. The result is often darkly beautiful, but it is also somewhat sterile and surprisingly uninvolving. The recent special edition DVD actually undercuts the visual interest of the film; the transfer is dreadful. If you are a fan who wants the bonus material--and there is a goodly amount of it--you would do best to hang onto your original DVD copy as well, for it will be superior to the version offered here.GFT, Amazon Reviewer ","genre":null},{"date":"3 February 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Although it received generally positive reviews and proved a world-wide box office success, public reaction to the 1992 BRAM STOKER'S Dracula was significantly mixed.

We have Todd becoming part of a community, and I think this is shown fairly well (even if the performance is wooden). The battle scenes are also pretty decent, which is good since that's a large part of the movie. But the transition is choppy.

This would have probably been the best horror movie ever, if it wasn't for Ridley Scott's masterpiece (Alien). But I would say, The Thing really gives Alien a run for its money, we are talking about the cream of the crop of the horror\/sci-fi category. It also easily qualifies as one of the best movies ever, regardless of genre. John Carpenter is a master of horror movie-making and here we find him at the pinnacle of his creative powers (although I consider Starman to be even better, but this isn't a horror film and it's another story). Top-notch performances from the all-male cast across the board, a-grade screen writing, stunning visuals and cinematography, and of course Carpenter's impeccable direction combine into a spellbinding, nightmarish tale of a would-be apocalypse unlike anything you have seen before. When I first checked to see how The Thing was doing on the IMDb scoreboard, back in 2001, I was disappointed to see it was hovering somewhere about 5.9 - 6.0. Most of the comments where not very good either, with a few exceptions. I was more than pleased to see this movie gaining more and more appreciation over the years. As I see now, it is among the top 250, with a score above 8.0 and with a good reason It is certainly one of the greatest horror movies in history, which went under the radar for many years, until it finally achieved the cult status it deserved in the first place.I was about 9 year old when I first watched this movie, late at night on TV - perfect conditions and age group to watch a film like that. Needless to say, I was scared to death! It took a long time until I watched it again, but the way I could remember all key scenes was a sign of the profound impact it had on me as a kid. Right from the haunting title sequence (which I think was later also copied in Predator) to the spectacular gore scenes, to the chilling sense of isolation and impending doom created by the gloomy score. Since then I have re-watched it many many times and I have to admit, it is perfect material for repeated viewing. More than a quarter of a century after its first (failed) release, witnessing the quality of what was supposed to be a b-movie of the 80's really puts most films shot today to shame. The detail and attention that went into the production design is truly amazing. The whole antarctic environment is replicated with tremendous accuracy. You can feel the cold and isolation of this barren white wasteland where the story is taking place and this is pivotal in creating the menacing, paranoia-inducing, claustrophobic atmosphere that permeates the film from start to finish.The story itself is quite unconventional, based on an acclaimed novella from 1938. A team of scientists stationed in Antarctica face an alien life form, found buried in the ice, which upon thawed has the ability to consume other living organisms (including people) and imitate them perfectly. The film concentrates around the fear, mistrust and communication breakdown that ensues between the members of the team, once they realize they are isolated from the outside world, unable to get help and with one or more of them possibly not being human. The way the dynamics of the team is presented and the realistic depiction of their reactions makes the movie transcend its original premise as just a horror\/sci-fi film and become something much deeper and profound. I am always amazed by the realistic behavior of each member, despite the unrealistic setup. You see people be afraid and some even break down, but you don't get you regular unstable guy who freaks out and tries to kill everybody. Kurt Russel gives a career-making performance, while the rest of the cast also does an excellent job. All around, a terrific ensemble piece. There is also a large amount of carefully timed quality gore, that is utterly mind-blowing.

But I would say, The Thing really gives Alien a run for its money, we are talking about the cream of the crop of the horror\/sci-fi category. It also easily qualifies as one of the best movies ever, regardless of genre. John Carpenter is a master of horror movie-making and here we find him at the pinnacle of his creative powers (although I consider Starman to be even better, but this isn't a horror film and it's another story). Top-notch performances from the all-male cast across the board, a-grade screen writing, stunning visuals and cinematography, and of course Carpenter's impeccable direction combine into a spellbinding, nightmarish tale of a would-be apocalypse unlike anything you have seen before. When I first checked to see how The Thing was doing on the IMDb scoreboard, back in 2001, I was disappointed to see it was hovering somewhere about 5.9 - 6.0. Most of the comments where not very good either, with a few exceptions. I was more than pleased to see this movie gaining more and more appreciation over the years. As I see now, it is among the top 250, with a score above 8.0 and with a good reason It is certainly one of the greatest horror movies in history, which went under the radar for many years, until it finally achieved the cult status it deserved in the first place.I was about 9 year old when I first watched this movie, late at night on TV - perfect conditions and age group to watch a film like that. Needless to say, I was scared to death! It took a long time until I watched it again, but the way I could remember all key scenes was a sign of the profound impact it had on me as a kid.

Since then I have re-watched it many many times and I have to admit, it is perfect material for repeated viewing. More than a quarter of a century after its first (failed) release, witnessing the quality of what was supposed to be a b-movie of the 80's really puts most films shot today to shame. The detail and attention that went into the production design is truly amazing. The whole antarctic environment is replicated with tremendous accuracy. You can feel the cold and isolation of this barren white wasteland where the story is taking place and this is pivotal in creating the menacing, paranoia-inducing, claustrophobic atmosphere that permeates the film from start to finish.The story itself is quite unconventional, based on an acclaimed novella from 1938. A team of scientists stationed in Antarctica face an alien life form, found buried in the ice, which upon thawed has the ability to consume other living organisms (including people) and imitate them perfectly. The film concentrates around the fear, mistrust and communication breakdown that ensues between the members of the team, once they realize they are isolated from the outside world, unable to get help and with one or more of them possibly not being human. The way the dynamics of the team is presented and the realistic depiction of their reactions makes the movie transcend its original premise as just a horror\/sci-fi film and become something much deeper and profound. I am always amazed by the realistic behavior of each member, despite the unrealistic setup. You see people be afraid and some even break down, but you don't get you regular unstable guy who freaks out and tries to kill everybody. Kurt Russel gives a career-making performance, while the rest of the cast also does an excellent job. All around, a terrific ensemble piece.

","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"3 February 2008","score":"","review":" Time has a way of qualifying our initial assessment of films, and this is particularly true of films made by director Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980.) Throughout the 1930s and 1940s he was regarded as a solid craftsman but not an artist; in the 1950s many of his films, most notoriously VERTIGO, were received with lukewarm interest. In the 1960s, however, attitudes about his work began to change, and with that came a major re-evaluation of his films. Films that had been earlier dismissed were recognized as great classics; some films that had received tremendous recognition at the time of their release were now seen as somewhat over-praised.To a certain extent this re-evaluation continues today, and at this point one film in particular proves extremely contentious to critics THE BIRDS, which was considered both extremely innovative and a great shocker in 1963 but which is now teetering on the brink of critical dismissal. Just as it took some thirty years to fix VERTIGO's position in the Hitchcock lexicon, so may it take fifty to arrive at a final summation here.According to film lore, Hitchcock was intrigued by a newspaper story about a bird attack, and his interest in the story gradually evolved into THE BIRDS. (Although technically based on the 1952 novella by Dauphne du Maurier, the story and film bear little relation to each other.) The story developed by Hitchcock and Evan Hunter concerned slightly wild San Francisco socialite Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren), who becomes infatuated with Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor) and whimsically follows him to his home at Bodgea Bay as a prank. Not long after her arrival, however, she is attacked by a seagull, and although her injuries are slight she is quickly, albeit somewhat unwillingly, received by Mitch and his circle. One attack soon leads to another, and before very long Melanie, Mitch, and the entire community are under siege.THE BIRDS is primarily famous for the sheer number of disconcerting and often stunning set ups it creates for the birds' attacks. Two of these are particularly famous. While Melanie sits on a bench outside the grade school, her attention is attracted by a flying bird--and she turns to find the playground's jungle gym covered with crows, assembling for an attack as the children leave the school. Later, when the birds attack the town itself, Melanie is trapped in a telephone booth, a helpless witness to the horrors around her even as the birds begin to batter the glass that protects her.But the sheer brilliance of these set pieces is off-set by the overall film itself. Stories and scripts of Hitchcock films are usually very tight and very precise, but where THE BIRDS is concerned you could drive a Mac Truck through the gaps. It is much easier to 'suspend disbelief' re the bird attacks than it is to accept the way in which the characters behave throughout the film. This is not actually the fault of the cast, which ranges from serviceable to excellent, but rather of the way the film works (or more specifically, doesn't work) as a whole. Having made up her mind to play a prank on Mitch, how is it that Melanie can't come up with a better one? Why evacuate the children into open air instead of an interior room? Why search for the source of a sound, alone no less, when you know what the source must be? Hitchcock apologists tend to justify these and many other loose ends in the film by stating that THE BIRDS is intended to have an open-ended structure without resolution and that the random and often incomprehensible nature of the script is intended to reflect the random and incomprehensible nature of the bird attacks. A typical argument in favor of the film also notes that the film is driven by themes instead of plot points. Well-- maybe. But I'm an art film fan myself, and I can't see it.In the final analysis, THE BIRDS is more akin to modern ultra-commercial action and adventure films than it is to an art-film, with the action and adventure distracting you from the holes in the thing--including the fact that the film is surprising slow. Even so, while THE BIRDS has major flaws, it is so crammed with iconographic moments and visuals that it is impossible to completely dismiss the film as a commercial wallow pure and simple. At its best, THE BIRDS has an incredibly high level of artistry, and those moments really do carry the film and impress themselves in your mind in a most remarkable way. I offer my own experience as an example. I first saw THE BIRDS on television when I was a teenager, and although I thought it was entertaining enough I wasn't particularly impressed. The next morning, however, I opened the living room curtains--startled a flock of birds perched on the outside window sill--and I was scared half to death. And that's cinematic power, nothing else.The DVD presents the film in excellent form and includes several bonuses, most particularly Hitchcock's darkly humorous movie trailer and outlines of a deleted scene. Final comment it's extremely uneven, but it is also extremely powerful.

If you think all animated films are for kids (Disney films), or for very low-minded adults and teens (Adult Swim cartoons), prepare to be proved wrong. Hayao Miyazaki is a legend in animation that revolutionized the craft in his storytelling and imagery.Princess Mononoke is a film of a journey, of war and peace, of character perseverance, and of balance. Set in a mythological Japan, it tells the tale of a warrior on a journey to fulfill a destiny of which he doesn't know yet. He has to endure demons, villagers, warriors, and forest spirits, both good and bad. And Ashitaka, the hero, is a peaceful mind unlike any other seen in films. He never waivers between what's good or bad, and only has the intention of peace and prosperity between all living things.Before you go thinking this is a preachy medieval warfare yada-yada film you've seen a thousand times before, please trust me in that this film still deserves a viewing to even those with no immediate interest.First, a warning. Ignore everything negative you've heard about this movie. I'm not saying this as a fanboy who gets irate when people give negative reviews on stuff I love, but because this film simply deserves a chance. It took me 3 times of seeing this before it overtook me and I fell in love with it.So what makes this film so amazing, anyway? First of all, the obvious the writer\/director and animator Hayao Miyazaki. Known for revolutionizing the animation world with his non-conventional children's films (Kiki's Delivery Service, My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away), this is his most mature film, and I don't just mean in terms of content. Yes, this film is PG- 13, violent, and probably not meant for the younger kids, but it's beside the point. The story is dark and deeply personal. Miyazaki had stated that after all his more family-friendly films were out, this was the film he felt he just had to make. And there is an air of deep seriousness that comes with this film that's hard to miss.Please remember this, most of all Miyazaki's films ARE NOT ANIME. Let me repeat MIYAZAKI DOES NOT MAKE ANIME FILMS. The number one prejudice people will have going into his works will be their view on the strange, typical Anime world and their views on it. I am NOT an Anime fan, I'm generally neutral towards it. A few shows are entertaining, and one or two films, but I would never consider myself a fan. Miyazaki is completely different in style, animation, texture and story. The one thing that angers more than anything are the people who bash this film because they don't like Anime. I beg of everyone who hasn't seen this film to take that into consideration.Miyazaki's paints a world like no one has ever seen, and always beautiful and fascinating. But what really brings his films to life is the music. Half of what makes his films so beautiful is the score of Joe Hisaishi, perhaps the most gifted musician in movies of all time. His music is intriguing, mysterious and impossible to look past. With films like this, I get to thinking his music was made for Miyazaki, and Miyazaki's films were made for Hisaishi. They balance each other perfectly and work marvelously.Now, many people may not think much of this film the first time they see it, and I was no exception. I was a huge Miyazaki fan already when I saw it for the first time, and I was expecting to love this the same. But the first time I saw it, my feelings were neutral. So a few months went by, and I decided to give this another try. The same thing. It didn't strike me. So another few months go by, and another whim comes over me to give it one last shot. And it finally worked. I was swept away in the story for the first time, and it overtook me.So if you see the film once and are not immediately in love with it, you may just need to try it again in due time. But please, don't think that I'm trying to make you feel that something's wrong with you if you don't like it. I know some people just won't like it, and some people even strongly dislike it. This review is my opinion and love of the film, and I'm just trying to do my part to help other people have their lives enriched like mine has been.All in all, Princess Mononoke is one of the most amazing films ever made. Easily, it's probably the most well-made animated film, but the animation world aside, this film conquers a HIGH percentage of all films and sets a mark on all cinema. The sad thing is it will most likely be ignored because, A, it's Japanese, B, it's highly unknown, and C, it's marked as Anime and will probably never go past that categorization.But at least take some of these many dragged on comments I have made into consideration if you haven't seen it. Most of you may be let down by it after reading how much I have praised it, but if there's at least a few who are affected by it as I have been, than I will live that much more in content. May Miyazaki's legacy live on through the rest of time.

So a few months went by, and I decided to give this another try. The same thing. It didn't strike me. So another few months go by, and another whim comes over me to give it one last shot. And it finally worked.

But please, don't think that I'm trying to make you feel that something's wrong with you if you don't like it. I know some people just won't like it, and some people even strongly dislike it. This review is my opinion and love of the film, and I'm just trying to do my part to help other people have their lives enriched like mine has been.All in all, Princess Mononoke is one of the most amazing films ever made. Easily, it's probably the most well-made animated film, but the animation world aside, this film conquers a HIGH percentage of all films and sets a mark on all cinema. The sad thing is it will most likely be ignored because, A, it's Japanese, B, it's highly unknown, and C, it's marked as Anime and will probably never go past that categorization.But at least take some of these many dragged on comments I have made into consideration if you haven't seen it. Most of you may be let down by it after reading how much I have praised it, but if there's at least a few who are affected by it as I have been, than I will live that much more in content.

","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"3 February 2008","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" For those who have never heard of this, or any of Hayao Miyazaki's works, please do yourself a favor and offer the courtesy of checking out his works.Forget everything you know about animation, if all you've experienced is the mind-numbing, lowest-common-denominator American money-maker cartoons. If you think all animated films are for kids (Disney films), or for very low-minded adults and teens (Adult Swim cartoons), prepare to be proved wrong. Hayao Miyazaki is a legend in animation that revolutionized the craft in his storytelling and imagery.Princess Mononoke is a film of a journey, of war and peace, of character perseverance, and of balance. Set in a mythological Japan, it tells the tale of a warrior on a journey to fulfill a destiny of which he doesn't know yet. He has to endure demons, villagers, warriors, and forest spirits, both good and bad. And Ashitaka, the hero, is a peaceful mind unlike any other seen in films. He never waivers between what's good or bad, and only has the intention of peace and prosperity between all living things.Before you go thinking this is a preachy medieval warfare yada-yada film you've seen a thousand times before, please trust me in that this film still deserves a viewing to even those with no immediate interest.First, a warning. Ignore everything negative you've heard about this movie. I'm not saying this as a fanboy who gets irate when people give negative reviews on stuff I love, but because this film simply deserves a chance. It took me 3 times of seeing this before it overtook me and I fell in love with it.So what makes this film so amazing, anyway? First of all, the obvious the writer\/director and animator Hayao Miyazaki. Known for revolutionizing the animation world with his non-conventional children's films (Kiki's Delivery Service, My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away), this is his most mature film, and I don't just mean in terms of content. Yes, this film is PG- 13, violent, and probably not meant for the younger kids, but it's beside the point. The story is dark and deeply personal. Miyazaki had stated that after all his more family-friendly films were out, this was the film he felt he just had to make. And there is an air of deep seriousness that comes with this film that's hard to miss.Please remember this, most of all Miyazaki's films ARE NOT ANIME. Let me repeat MIYAZAKI DOES NOT MAKE ANIME FILMS. The number one prejudice people will have going into his works will be their view on the strange, typical Anime world and their views on it. I am NOT an Anime fan, I'm generally neutral towards it. A few shows are entertaining, and one or two films, but I would never consider myself a fan. Miyazaki is completely different in style, animation, texture and story. The one thing that angers more than anything are the people who bash this film because they don't like Anime. I beg of everyone who hasn't seen this film to take that into consideration.Miyazaki's paints a world like no one has ever seen, and always beautiful and fascinating. But what really brings his films to life is the music. Half of what makes his films so beautiful is the score of Joe Hisaishi, perhaps the most gifted musician in movies of all time. His music is intriguing, mysterious and impossible to look past. With films like this, I get to thinking his music was made for Miyazaki, and Miyazaki's films were made for Hisaishi. They balance each other perfectly and work marvelously.Now, many people may not think much of this film the first time they see it, and I was no exception. I was a huge Miyazaki fan already when I saw it for the first time, and I was expecting to love this the same. But the first time I saw it, my feelings were neutral.

Those who love it enjoy its mix of homage and originality and its remarkably black sense of humor. Those who hate it feel that the humor becomes so black that it descends into a sort of lowbrow meanspiritedness that undermines any amusement involved. Strange to say, they're both right.The story is the classic alien invasion tale given increasingly weird twists. The United States decides to construe the arrival of a Martian fleet of flying saucers as a friendly arrival--but alas, the Martians have a sense of humor so distasteful that a herd of drunken frat boys look like Noel Coward in comparison. Cattle catch fire and stampede! Heads are switched with pet dogs! Congress is wiped out by ray gun! Can a highly unnatural pairing of Slim Whitman and Tom Jones save the day? Well, you never know.The film is rife with sight-gags, and when they work they work go off with a bang--with the Las Vegas scenes the high point of the film. It is true that the Martians are a tacky bunch, but it's hard to be tackier than Vegas, and director Tim Burton successfully works the joke to the nth degree. Trouble is, the rest of the film isn't at quite same level. It's presented as a joke, but it's hard to laugh when the residents of a retirement home are reduced to wheelchair-bound skeletons. MARS ATTACKS reaches for laugh after laugh, but too often the reach is funny and the pay off isn't.The film has a host of actors, some famous, some infamous, and some just plain camp. Jack Nicholson does double duty as President of the United States and a Las Vegas promoter; Glenn Close scores as the First Lady; Lisa-Marie is weirdly snakey as the Martian Girl; and Sylvia Sidney is memorable as the semi-senile Granny armed with Slim Whitman records. There are a lot more Rod Steiger, Pierce Brosman, Sarah Jessica Parker, Pam Greer, and so on, and most of them are as hit and miss as the film itself. I have to confess an unexpected liking for Tom Jones, who dives into the thing feet first and proves a lot fun. But it's the look and style that carry the thing, and it's all very What the hell was that? The DVD is truly no frills, although it does contain a few Martian jokes that are (somewhat like the film) more annoying than actually funny. Recommended as a curiosity and with the warning that you should rent it before you buy it if you love it, you'll be more than ready to whip out the cash, but if you hate it, you'll grit your teeth for having spent a dime.GFT, Amazon Reviewer ","genre":null},{"date":"3 February 2008","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Suggested by a series of kiddie trading cards deemed so subversively violent that they were pulled from the market, MARS ATTACKS! is a film that tends to divide viewers into love it and hate it camps.

Oddly, the first version was made just a few years ago and was a Falcon series film--with George Sanders instead of Phillip Marlow. While Sanders was quite dapper and sophisticated, he was nothing like the hard-boiled and sarcastic Marlow. Despite this, it was still a dandy film and it actually stayed closer to the original story in some places--particularly the ending (which, oddly, MURDER, MY SWEET screws up). I've also seen the Robert Mitchum version made in the 1970s, and while it's good, overall MURDER, MY SWEET is the best of the three film versions.Perhaps the best thing about MURDER, MY SWEET is how well Dick Powell fit into this tough guy role. While in the past he was known as a pretty boy and a song and dance man, here he is all sarcasm--much like Bogart's rendition of Marlow in THE BIG SLEEP and Robert Montgomery's in THE LADY IN THE LAKE. All three veteran actors did a great job at catching the character, though (and I know this will sound like heresy), I liked Montgomery's version the best--he took sarcasm and being a total jerk to a level the other two didn't quite reach. I'm sure some of this was due to Montgomery, but having excellent writers also helped a lot.As for the movie, like the other two versions I mentioned (THE FALCON TAKES OVER with a score of 8 and FAREWELL MY LOVELY also an 8), it is rather sanitized. Marlow is a smart-aleck--not quite as cold and hard-bitten as he is in the book and the Black neighborhoods and prostitutes and all are somehow missing or look amazingly Hollywood-ish. However, given the censorship codes of the time, you can't blame the first two films from changing the plot--at least in some places--otherwise the film never would have been shown!Now despite these problems, this is a wonderful Film Noir picture---with a complicated but excellent plot, very good acting, writing and direction and it can't help but keep your interest. For a Chandler novel, you can't get much better even with its mistakes and omissions (though I still think LADY IN THE LAKE is a tad better--but not by much--both are 9s).By the way, with a few negative story elements you might wonder HOW I still could give this film a 9. The dialog and suspense were so good, even with a few problems, it's a dynamite film.

Films this cool and exciting don't come too often, but when they do it makes one feel like a dream has come true. Steven Spielberg is just one of those filmmakers who knows how to give us that feeling with their work.My rating 5\/5 ","genre":"Adventure, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"3 February 2008","score":"","review":" The Day the Earth Stood Still was acclaimed as a masterpiece when originally released. At the peak of the arms race and right before the red scare really began to take its toll, its message of pacifism and communication between opposing nations was quite refreshing and surprising. The film is a bit dated understandably, often wallowing in the gee-whiz style of the day and occasional bits of nationalism. Still, the final message is just as powerful today as when originally released. The film ultimately remains shockingly relevant. Its further proof that many so called genre films of the era were amazingly intelligent - The Incredible Shrinking Man powerfully touches upon what it means to be human, Forbidden Planet is a literate adaptation of Shakespeare, Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a powerful representation of mass paranoia, and The Day the Earth Stood Still has a more powerful anti-war leaning than anything else in its day.The film is very well made in addition to being a powerful experience. Robert Wise isn't a great visionary director, but hes good at storytelling and maintaining an effective pace. Also, the acting is very good, particularly Michael Rennie in the lead role. His performance is one of great elegance, grace, and subtlety. Its really a shame he wasn't able to capitalize on his promise and become a more renowned actor, because hes really terrific here. The supporting cast is quite good as well, particularly the always excellent Sam Jaffe. The Day the Earth Stood Still has a few dated elements, but overall its still a powerful experience.

I can't believe all the comments here praising it as an original action movie. It plays more like a comedy than action, the acting is terrible, what is the story with the shitty Irish accents I'm Irish and I don't know anyone who sounds like that and anyway as far as I know they have been living there all their lives, so would they not have American accents?. The only positive that I took away from this film was David Del Rocko(the only intentionally funny person in the film). Please would someone tell me what was going on with William Defoe's character what a weird man how many cops go prancing around crime scenes the way he does.
