Is just medical care and medication and making sure the patient lives all that matters? Or is bringing joy and laughter into their lives so that they not just exist, but live, just as important?It is a inspirational movie and not many actors have the calibre that Williams have to bring it off.

In Aladdin, though, it just worked. Robin Williams pulled it off really well. I love the movie through and through, but I'll say that he was the best part about it, even though it did take me a while to realize who all the people he was impersonating were. It wasn't only Robin Williams, though, so don't think that's what I'm saying. The music was also really good. I tried to learn all the songs from the soundtrack, but I never quite got them all. I just love the movie as a whole. My fondest memory of it is when two of my friends and I tried once to act the whole movie out, but we never got past the scene where Aladdin sings One Jump Ahead. I was the shortest, so I always played Iago and Abu. Not even Beauty and the Beast, my favorite Disney movie, has such nostalgic value to me. It's only too bad that neither of the sequels was worthy to carry the Aladdin name.

I was wrong; really, really wrong. King of Thieves started out with such a good premise, Aladdin discovering his father as the leader of a band of thieves, and that's why I can't stand it. It took the perfectly good premise and destroyed it with Genie overkill. I was glad Robin Williams was back and everything, but I really didn't want to see him in almost every single scene. Also, the jokes seemed a lot more forced; it all reeked of been there, done that. The animation was once again shoddy in comparison to the original, the colors once again murder to the eyes. The songs were really bad, not a single one of them memorable in any way. I came off hating this movie even more than Return of Jafar despite Robin Williams.

The first time I saw this movie, I actually kind of liked it. Just goes to show how Disney can sucker people into liking this sort of sub-TV quality stuff. After the first few times, though, I realized that this was complete and utter JUNK!! Normally, I don't judge a movie by its animation quality since it's usually not a big issue to me, but I'll make an exception here. The animation was obviously television quality, which isn't that good to begin with, but they took an excellently animated movie and made it look like a common TV show. I especially take issue with the coloring. The coloring looked about ten times richer in the original movie. The coloring here was more like a total and complete eyesore. Next, I'll say that Dan Castellaneta was okay as the Genie, but (all together now) HE WAS NO ROBIN WILLIAMS! I don't make this kind of argument if the replacement does an excellent job on his own, but he didn't. The magic that Robin Williams created in the first movie was simply not meant to reproduce because it was so completely his own. Yet they did try to recreate it with less than satisfactory results. And Jason Alexander Loved him in Seinfeld and in almost everything else I've seen him in. Why put him here? It was so unnecessary. The other voices were kind of just there. They were nice, but nothing stood out. At least the music was kind of halfway decent. Nothing like Whole New World, but passable. In short, the only reason this movie was ever released was because Disney thought they could make a quick buck from Aladdin. That's the only possible explanation I can think of.

Though I like the story, I still find it hard to sit through almost 3 hours as a man travels through life, heaven and hell to find his wife. The saving grace were the stunning landscape images, rich lush colors like the portraits they're painted on; solid acting from the main actors - Williams and Gooding Jr; and a story, which though occasionally sidetracks through lots of sub-plots, still manage to maintain the thread that keeps you watching.

I hate them, they're too crass and 'Sunset Beach'-ish.Thankfully what I witnessed on the 24th of August was not a comic translation of camp superheroes dressed in Superman's leftovers. The X-men themselves defy logic, as does this film.The plotline is far, far more potent and substantial than most so-called dramas today - a clear battle of hatred and fear shown in society today represented not as a good ol'fight between bad and evil but a complex delve into human motive.The plot however remains light and accessible for its 12+ ( UK ) rating. The running time was short and sweet leaving the audience in anticipation of a sequel - take a note John Woo, Tom Cruise etc,..Pivotal performances from Stewart and McKellen form the basis of the film's underbelly whilst a remarkably Russell Crowe-like Hugh Jackman is the perfect rogue hero. And on that note the real life Rogue, Storm and Cyclops are well played by the stupendously gorgeous Halle Berry and rising stars Paquin and Marsden. The villains say little and are basically Magneto's stooges but their excitable ones at that. Park, Mane and Stamos all adding to the flavour.This film was a welcome additon to a summer of not quite blockbuster proportions given the early part of the year. However I have one warning. Bryan Singer has moulded the film into the perfect launchpad for cult-status away from the picturebook geek squadron. When the sequels come which they surely will, please,please,please keep the format and cast, crew. It is very rare that a series of films swaps key roles succesfully ( Star Wars ), most keep the linchpins ( Indiana Jones )and those that fail... well, we all remember Batman and Robin don't we comicbook fans.
