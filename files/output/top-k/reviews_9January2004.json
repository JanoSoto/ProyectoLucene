It is the ability to feel sympathy for the villain of the film, in this case the truck driving 'Rusty Nail'. This was a good aspect of the film The Cell as well. I felt bad for 'Rusty Nail' because he really is just a lonely, overweight trucker, and when he gets his hopes up he is let down, and goes mad with rage.--I got really involved in this movie. I felt like I was experiencing everything with the characters, especially the paranoia they all begin to experience. Man, whenever I saw a truck in this movie it was like CRAP! WATCH OUT YOU GUYS! Another factor that helped is that I also cared about the characters in this movie, a very impressive factor since the characters do some pretty stupid stuff, we can still care a lot about what happens to them.--There was some good camera work in this film. The crazy angles helped to make the chaotic road-to-nowhere feeling of the film more effective, and I loved the use of shading with colours, especially red.--Personally I found this movie to be really scary. Like The Blair Witch Project the villain is never truly seen, and Joy Ride is another good reminder of what we can't see scares us the most. The voice of 'Rusty Nail' was also pretty horrifying and the constant sense of dread in the movie is very well maintained.THE BAD--Charlotte, the girl who gets captured at the end of the film isn't really given that much to do and actually doesn't have very much screen time. She shows up for about 2 minutes and then becomes the damsel in distress. Personally I would've liked her character to be more developed so we care more about what happens to her.RATING9\/10 - A frightening, suspenseful road adventure.

Of course, not all jokes are as good, but the great number of jokes ensures that certainly something really funny happens each minute. I love this style of movies!!If you liked Wrongfully Accused (a little), then I think you will love The Naked Gun (and the original series Police Squad), and Hot Shots.

The Wash was definitely better, but this is pretty much the same style, so if you like one, you probably will like the other. If the choice is between this and The Wash, I'd choose the latter. But that isn't to say that this is bad. It just isn't as good as it could've been. The plot is something a lot of guys will recognize, the hunt for a booty call. This is sort of a what if scenario, dealing with the question What if you had to go through a lot of ridiculous trials to get the booty? And some of the trials are truly ridiculous. But far-out isn't the same as bad; a lot of the humor is good, as long as you can take some rough, gross & extreme humor. There are a lot of semi-nude scenes, and sex scenes, but never any direct nudity. I don't know if this is to open it up to more audiences; I guess there are people who don't care about sexual humor but can't stand to see some nudity.

He did it with Nixon, he'll most likely do it with his upcoming Alexander the Great movie, and he most certainly did it with The Doors.First and foremost, Jim Morrison was a well-educated, intelligent, and very funny person who got along very well with almost everyone he encountered in his 27 short years of life (if he is in fact dead).

This is not the true Jim Morrison. The real man was, yes, an alcoholic who indeed had his way with many easy ladies, but he was so much more. He was the most revolutionary rockstar in history who paved the way for modern rockers and punks and rebels to act and portray themselves. And if anyone disagrees with me, I'd like them to prove me wrong. And not only that, Morrison was one of the most gifted poets in history, penning some of the best lyrics ever written. Finally, he was one hell of a good singer who, although he may not have had the best voice in music history, definitely had the greatest, most blood-curdling screams and rough, awesome voices.In conclusion, Oliver Stone should have never made such a ridiculously terrible movie about my favorite band, and one of the best bands ever, The Doors.
