Kidman is great as the feather-brained harpy who will stop at nothing to be on television - the absolute narrowness of her world-view to the parameters of what fits onto the TV screen makes her a kind of female counterpart to Jim Carrey's Cable guy. But her single-minded devotion to this aim causes her subsequent actions to make little sense would someone as ambitious as her really stick around in a nowhere New England town (humorously named Little Hope) rather than set out for the big time of New York or Los Angeles? Such a transplant would have given the movie a kick, since it would have set Suzanne's fundamental cluelessness against the reality of the television industry and how it actually works (to perhaps more humorous results than are displayed here).But even if you can buy Suzanne remaining in her isolated little hamlet (and it must be said that the setting does allow for some subtler, more understated humor than the scenario drawn above would have), does it make any sense whatsoever for her to get involved with, much less marry, the Matt Dillon character? If we're really supposed to buy her as someone who thinks about nothing but television and making it in that medium, then what could she possibly see in Dillon, who is barely even familiar with TV? Any explanation would probably be lame, but what's lamer is the fact that the filmmakers don't even try to supply one! This leaves you with the sick feeling that it only happens in order to get the plot moving - the worst possible reason for ANYTHING to happen!This fundamental flaw in plot logic really sinks the movie before it even has time to get going. That's a shame, because there are SO MANY good things here Kidman's performance is wonderfully perky and shallow in all the right ways, and the candy-colored outfits that have been designed for her are a scream just in themselves. The narrative style is inventive, being told in flashback as a series of interviews - Hard Copy style, or even Oprah style - with the main participants, which in itself forms a meta-critique upon television and its reconstruction of the world (although, curiously, the film keeps dropping in and out of this style, and so waters down its effect). Finally, Phoenix is at once both hilarious and heartbreaking in his portrayal of a trailer park teenager so besotted with Kidman and the sophistication she supposedly represents (the joke's on him, of course) that he'd literally do anything for her, which is exactly his undoing. Watching him, I kept thinking of Dustin Hoffman's groundbreaking performance in The Graduate and how it operated on the twin levels of satire and true sympathy all at once. Phoenix, in my opinion, hits the same bulls-eye.Other enjoyable performances come from Ileana Douglas as Dillon's sister, wonderfully nasty and sarcastic when discussing Kidman (and then surprisingly touching and vulnerable when you're least expecting it) and Wayne Knight as the head of the cable station where Suzanne comes to work. If you know Knight only as Newman on TV's Seinfeld and so believe him only capable of wild over-acting, his performance here is a treat his baffled and understated responses to Suzanne's dippy ideas and shenanigans are some of the funniest things in the picture.But in the end it all comes to nothing. The good things in this movie just can't salvage the fact that the central story has not been worked out with enough rigor. The film spins its wheels beautifully, but it simply has nowhere to go.

I was absolutely overjoyed when it was re-released. First of all, what I notice the most now, is David Bowie's fantastically wicked performance as the menacing, seductive Goblin King. Having David in it instantly gives the film an extra offbeat kind of charm - I don't deny being a major fan of his - but even if you're not a fan, you can still appreciate the high quality performance he gives, and how he fits the character so well - getting the perfect balance of a wicked, seductive and slightly strange Goblin King. His music instantly makes the film a jewel amongst other fantasy adventures. For example, the songs 'Within You' and 'As the World Falls Down' are almost painfully beautiful to hear. This is combined with an excellent performance from Jennifer Connelly as Sarah - the willful and strong heroine, and the amazing talents of Jim Henson and all of the wonderful creatures he creates. I believe that this is a film perfect for both adults and children who like to take a little trip into a magical world of escapism once in a while.One criticism, though.

This is the sort of intelligent, gripping movie Hollywood produces when it's at its best.

Michael Mann pushes the quasi-documentary camerawork perhaps just a bit too much for some tastes; I thought it was terrific.  A very deep nod of approval to Russell Crowe.  This is the sort of subtle acting that I don't think most folks realize is so special.  He details his performance so beautifully, even pushing up his glasses perfectly in character.  I could see both the reserved southern gent in him as well as the man who has a problem managing his anger.  The only time it doesn't completely work -- and I would suggest it was a writing and directing problem -- is in a scene in which he is badgered to get on the telephone.  His sudden explosion is more a movie mannerism than a glimpse of reality; little matter, though, as he quickly makes the scene work.  A terrific performance from Christopher Plummer, too.  (And Al does fine, keeping the ham largely off the plate.)The only movie that touches this one in 1999 is THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY (or, much more arguably, TOY STORY 2 and THE STRAIGHT STORY).

What makes it so great, besides a stellar performance by Bill Murray (which is, hands down, his best screen work to date) is how perfectly the script has been worked out, down to the tiniest little details. The premise is a solid one - a man is doomed to relive the same day over and over again until he learns how to become a better, less self-centered person. But it could have failed on so many levels the built-in repetition factor could easily have sunk the film, and a very real danger existed that the situation would simply become as boring and infuriating to the audience as it is to the main character. The filmmakers - director Harold Ramis and his co-writer Danny Rubin, who came up with the original story - find several ingenious ways to ring changes upon the premise, and do a totally convincing job in mapping out the growth and development of the main character. That character is a cruel and shallow Pittsburgh weatherman named Phil Connors who is disgusted to find himself once again in Punxsatawney Pennsylvania to cover the dreaded (to him) groundhog day festival. By being forced to live the day again and again, amongst people he despises, he will have to come to terms with his own shallowness and lack of human connection. The film, then, is his quest for personal redemption and deliverance. If that sounds heavy to you, well . . . it is, sort of. While the film is clearly a comedy (and is very very funny), it does not hesitate to display the horror and desperation of Phil's predicament. By the end, you FEEL for him, and have come to know him, in a way that just would not be possible if his situation was played only for laughs. If ever a movie wrung every last drop of greatness and potential out of its central premise, it is this one. If nothing else, the script should have been up for an Academy Award; it is - hands down - the best comedy script of the 90s.Of course, probably the biggest concern is that the audience will enjoy Phil being a crumb much more than they will watching him become a nice guy, which would pretty much undercut the central theme of the movie. This is where Bill Murray's amazing performance comes in to play, since he's equally entertaining as a good-hearted and reformed man as he is as a jaded cynic. This is no mean accomplishment, and it's absolutely essential for the movie's success if he came across as too nice, then we wouldn't buy the character's initial misanthropy, making the transformation a foregone conclusion; equally, if his change into a happier, more well-adjusted person wasn't funny and enjoyable in its own right, then we'd walk away thinking The movie had a great first hour - then it got boring as he started to change. Either eventuality would have absolutely killed this picture.Fortunately, Murray - perhaps unique among screen comics - has always been equally adept at working either side of the sweet \/ sour divide. He can just as easily be lovable as despicable, and get laughs doing both. I can't really think of any other comic actor who can do this (Robin Williams is always relentlessly cheery; Steve Martin is funniest when he's angriest; Jim Carrey couldn't get laughs by being sweet and sincere if his life depended on it, etc.). Therefore, the movie is unthinkable without him. But it is also an absolute gift to him - no other film he has ever done has allowed him to show this much range as an actor while still letting him play to his strengths. Anyone who witnessed him trying to go dramatic in The Razor's Edge, or to bring off a similar grump-turns-into-a-nice-guy premise in the atrocious Scrooged will know exactly what I mean.To sum up, this is one of the best films ever, and belongs on that short list of works that are truly uplifting and heartwarming - but which EARN it. As transformation movies go, it's right up there with the seasonal classics of Scrooge, the Grinch and George Bailey in It's A Wonderful Life - all without the benefit of the Christmas season for its backdrop.

For those who whine and complain about the fact that the rules for the trilogy were ignored, THAT'S THE POINT! The trailers and everything said, Forget the rules. And they did - they outlined the rules and then broke them. On to the performances - Neve Campbell was wonderful here. For all of us who have come along with her for the entire series, it was heartbreaking to see her finally totally break down after the confrontation on the Stab 3 set in her house, and inspiring to see her finally have built up the strength to face the killer (or -ers) after everything she's been through. Courteney and David were great together and separately, with Parker Posey adding wonderful support as the Gale Weathers clone. She provides some of the biggest laughs this time around. I loved how they brought back Sid's dad in that one scene, and Billy's dad too, in the footage in the finale. They were both played by the same actors as in the first, making it even more realistic. And bringing the actress whose picture sat in for Maureen Prescott in 1 and 2 into the movie to play her ghost was very inspired. Add to that Liev Schrieber and Jamie Kennedy, and the gang's all back for the final act. And who would have thought that a line like Would you be willing to settle for a PG-13 relationship? would bring on such nostalgia? Ha ha! The grand finale works so well. It's wonderful to watch. And even though the killer is hard to foresee, he or she or they still make(s) perfect sense. What is so great about this film is seeing the little things from the series addressed such as, will anyone Sidney is friends with ever survive to see the closing credits? The finale addresses this question big time, with the fates of several characters resting in Sidney's hands and finally giving her the ability to prevent their deaths, an ability she was never given in the first two films. And the final scene wraps up everything so perfectly and sweetly, with the very last minutes just perfectly handled, leaving us with the perfect combination of closure and yet openness. I am a huge Scream fan, and this film lived up to all my expectations of how the series should end. Everyone in the cast did a superb job, however, I think that some of the actors with smaller parts should have been given more time to develop their characters (Deon Richmond, Matt Keeslar). However, everyone had at least one memorable bit, including some great cameos. (It's so cool that Jay and Silent Bob show up in this movie, seeing as how Kevin Williamson and Kevin Smith are my two favorite screenwriters.) In the overall scheme of things, this film was better than the second, but not as good as the original simply because it's NOT the original, nor do I think it was the intention to top the original. I think the filmmakers made the best movie they could, and even though Kevin didn't return and Ehren Kruger could never replace him, I think Wes and Neve and Courteney and David remained true to the spirit of the series, and kept things in the same perspective.

I was only 6 years old so my first reaction to Jack Nicholson was to be completely terrified of him.I am a big fan of Stephen King's novel of which this film is based on.  As different and as simplified as this movie is from the book, this is still an exceptionally spooky horror film.  I think Stanley Kubrick did a great job by NOT explaining every supernatural vision portrayed here.  The best aspect of his films is that they demand not only repeat viewings but also open up situations that can be debated among viewers long after the film is over. Kubrick does not take the position of someone who knows all about the supernatural - he is just as human as the rest of us.  He can only explain as much as we all can see.  What it all means is something that creates great conversation although people tend to become frustrated when all the answers are not provided for them.Whether or not you liked this movie, there is no denying that you will never forget it, especially the images Kubrick creates - the blood pouring out of the elevator, the two little girls, the lady in the bathtub, Jack Torrence's repetitious novel and Jack and his trusty axe chasing a little boy through the hedge maze.  And pay attention to the opening credit sequence as Jack drives to the Overlook Hotel - it appears as if the glaring sun in some shots are lined up with Jack's car, as if pulling him towards his dark destiny.And it's time to give credit where it is due - Shelly Duvall is excellent. The first few times I saw the film, I found her quite annoying.  Upon watching it again recently I began to realize that she has many childlike qualities which make her relationship with their son much stronger than what she has with her husband.  This gives the films climax more credibility. The rest of the cast is great as well - Danny Lloyd, people claim, is too bland in his role but I think he translates perfectly the insecurity of a child his age having the power he has - capable of conjuring up images that no one should have to bear.  I have always been a fan of the late, great Scatman Crothers.  Here, he was given a dramatic role and I think he gave his best performance.  And, of course, Jack is Jack at his (appropriately) over-the-top best.But this movie works because of Kubrick, the wonderfully creepy music and the sets for the hotel.  I've never seen such ordinary rooms appear so frightening.  His use of wide-angle lenses in tight areas make you feel the characters tremendous sense of isolation.This is not your typical film viewing experience and that is what is so fantastic about it.  Films that actually make you think and debate with others - a perspective that many film makers today have all but deserted for safe, throw-in- everything-including-the-kitchen-sink, story structure. I believe this is a primary example of why our society has become lazy in the way our minds think.  We want all our questions answered at the push of a button on our keyboard.If you want to be truly spooked, you near to obtain that fear of the unknown.  The Shining will do just that.  I promise.

Lang.  As the film opens he is following an ice princess, played by Ashley Judd, in a role that mom and sister, Naomi and Wynona might wince at.  She seems to have a bit of an issue with men, violently killing them at the very moment they think she going to put out.    The film never really explains itself fully so we are never sure what Ewan's character, The Eye, is supposed to be doing, however based on his bickering with K.D. we do know that he shouldn't be spending too much time with Ashley.  As I mentioned, The Eye has a lot of neat tools and with them he is able to get detailed video of Ashley in the act of killing.  We quickly learn that The Eye has a bit of an infatuation going with her because he never thinks to turn her in, but rather protect her from authority. I was quite taken by this movie from the moment it opened.  A cold and vacant mood is set from the start that is a treat to watch.  Stunning visuals, over-the-top acting from both Judd and McGregor, and a host of eerie images make this film difficult to break away from. Judd has become popular lately for playing the female lead in pop-thrillers.  Her turn here as a psycho witch is a departure to say the least, that is fun to watch.  Donning a new wig every five minutes, she never breaks from her role as a tough girl who has gone over the deep end.Complimenting Judd, McGregor delivers a low key performance.  Still bitter over a divorce and the loss of his daughter (who, by the way, is always around) The Eye is not your typical hero.  This guy has issues. Supporting performances from Jason Priestly, as an out-of-control heroin addict and Genvieve Bujold, as a den mother for the ice princess set, help to keep this film from dragging. An unpredictable story, Eye of the Beholder works well right up until the final moments. That, sadly, is where this film crashes and burns.  If ever an ending could kill a neat little art-house thriller, Eye of the Beholder is proof.  Films from yesteryear like Get Carter and Alfie complimented the wacky era from which they came.
