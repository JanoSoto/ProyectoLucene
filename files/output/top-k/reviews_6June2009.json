The unusual concept of Mel Gibson as a villain\/good-guy got the movie stuck in my head. I researched into it on IMDb and added the DC version to my 'need to watch' movie list. I figured I'd be in for an experience that bends the usual revenge scenario.The movie opens at a slow pace and puts you in the middle of the story. Alright, this isn't a bad way of placing suspense with the audience. Problem is that with a plot like this, it feels way too cut\/copy\/paste from Reservoir Dogs. While this popped in my head it didn't take away from anything, I continued to watch. I then watch a scene where the super-cool typical 90's style character Porter has a scene with a woman that wronged him. I over exaggerate bit. I begin to notice that Porter has too many character stereotypes that make this movie feel unrealistic and take away from it's supposed gritty tone. I sometimes think I'm watching Sargeant Briggs.This is a revenge movie, and the reason for this revenge rampage is sufficient enough to make you care about Porter's forthcoming adventure. After this reason, the plot falls very hard. There are two bad guys that are overly annoying and geeky (the kind that don't actually work in the mob). I see this as a cheap was of getting the audience involved in wanting a brutal killing that does get delivered. The original bad guy is dealt with half way through the movie which leaves the second half feeling a tad unguided. This doesn't default as a bad thing but Porter's goals are no longer about revenge at this point. Porter can't be considered 100% bad-guy because he kind of deserves the money he seeks. I feel like this fact is hidden while the movie is promoted for 'rooting for the bad guy'. I do give credit for being one of the only movies like this, but there's no teeter-totter argument with Porter being good or bad. He is a criminal, but keeps earning our sympathy so his bad deeds feel justified.Interestingly, he isn't the guns blazing psycho type. He deals with the bad guys by taking advantage of every impassibly tiny vulnerability. And each big crime boss only has two dumb body guards.There is an obvious plot device that saves this movie from being complete generic trash Porter kills people in cold blood. The premise that hooked me into watching this movie was delivered successfully. This made the film entertaining in-spite of the lacking aesthetic value. Lucy Lui shows up being sexy as always, playing a sadist prostitute. While being top-notch sex appeal, she does nothing for the plot. Another scene to note is the van gun fight against the Asian gang. This was scripted well and stood out as being unique. The ending is unimportant. By the time it was over I wasn't sure what I just watched. i didn't learn anything. The movie tries to throw a fresh spin on a typical 90's crime movie. While it succeeds at some points, the lame plot ruins the idea. It feels like someone tried to cover up a cooker cutter movie with an original concept. In the end it feels like a half hearted attempt that doesn't live up to the hype and i feel let down. I now understand why this movie isn't more popular than it is.

This genre does not, however, always transfer well to the cinema screen; films such as Fatherland and The Philadelphia Experiment 2, both set in a world where the Nazis won World War II, are often disappointing. Perhaps the best film of this type is the British Quest for Love from 1973, which is set in two parallel universes, ours and an alternate one in which the war never took place. That film, however, concentrates far more upon the personal lives of its characters than it does on the political and historical background. (It is never, for example, explained exactly how war was avoided in 1939 or whether the Nazis are still in power in the seventies).Sliding Doors is a film which takes the concept of parallel universes and applies it not to great political events but to a seemingly trivial detail in the life of its central character Helen Quilley. Helen is a London public relations executive who is fired from her job and goes to the Underground station to catch a train home. It is at this point that the plot splits into two parallel universes. One plot line shows what happens to Helen if she catches the train; the other what happens to her if she misses it. The film's title refers to the doors of the train which slide shut before Helen can enter (or, alternately, remain open for her).In one timeline, Helen catches the train and returns home in time to catch her boyfriend Gerry in bed with another woman, Lydia. She dumps Gerry, moves in with her best friend Anna, and begins a romance with another man named James. In the second timeline Helen misses the train and is delayed getting home, which means that she does not catch Gerry and Lydia together. She continues her relationship with Gerry, unaware that he is cheating on her.The two plot lines run in tandem, with frequent switches from the James timeline to the Gerry one, and the story could easily have become very confusing. Fortunately, director Peter Howitt handles his material well, and the two parallel stories remain easy to follow, especially as Gwyneth Paltrow has a different hairstyle in each timeline. Howitt was previously best known to me as the star of the late eighties sitcom Bread; Sliding Doors was his first film as director. (He also wrote the script).The film is essentially a romantic comedy with a metaphysical twist. The James timeline, in particular, contains many traditional rom-com features, such as the misunderstanding which threatens the happiness of the lovers but is later overcome. Indeed, I would rate it as one of the two best British romantic comedies of the nineties, the other being Four Weddings and a Funeral. Both films pair a British leading man with an American leading lady, as did another successful British rom-com from the period, Notting Hill. Another link between them is that John Hannah, who stars as James here, also appeared in the earlier film. Sliding Doors was a rare opportunity for Hannah to take a leading role; I have normally thought of him as a supporting actor, as in Four Weddings or the various Mummy films.Paltrow is one of the few American actors who can play a British character convincingly, and she gets another chance to use the accent she had perfected for Emma and was to use later in the same year in Shakespeare in Love. Helen not only sounds convincingly British, she also sounds like a middle-class Londoner. Paltrow resists the temptation either to make her character too upper-class like Natalie Portman in V for Vendetta or to retreat into a faux-Cockney like Patricia Arquette in The Secret Agent. More important than the accent is the fact that she makes Helen a warm, sympathetic and lovable heroine. Although she was to win an Oscar for Shakespeare in Love, I felt that her performance in Sliding Doors was easily the better of the two. Not that the Academy, of course, hand out Oscars for anything done in small-scale independent British films.The dialogue is often very witty, unlike some rom-coms which tend to concentrate on the romance at the expense of the comedy. (Gerry, I'm a woman! We don't say what we want! But we reserve the right to get p*ssed off if we don't get it). Howitt is evidently a Monty Python fan (and a Beatles fan as well), which tends to prejudice me in his favour. Nevertheless, there is also often a darkness about the film, which many comedies lack; one of the two timelines ends in tragedy, while the other ends on a hopeful note, but not necessarily the traditional happy ending. The result is a highly original romantic comedy, by turns amusing and unsettling. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 June 2009","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" One of my favourite types of imaginative fiction is alternative history- the genre which asks questions like What would have happened if Napoleon had won the battle of Waterloo?

The result is a highly original romantic comedy, by turns amusing and unsettling. 8\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy"},{"date":"6 June 2009","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" One of my favourite types of imaginative fiction is alternative history- the genre which asks questions like What would have happened if Napoleon had won the battle of Waterloo? This genre does not, however, always transfer well to the cinema screen; films such as Fatherland and The Philadelphia Experiment 2, both set in a world where the Nazis won World War II, are often disappointing. Perhaps the best film of this type is the British Quest for Love from 1973, which is set in two parallel universes, ours and an alternate one in which the war never took place. That film, however, concentrates far more upon the personal lives of its characters than it does on the political and historical background. (It is never, for example, explained exactly how war was avoided in 1939 or whether the Nazis are still in power in the seventies).Sliding Doors is a film which takes the concept of parallel universes and applies it not to great political events but to a seemingly trivial detail in the life of its central character Helen Quilley. Helen is a London public relations executive who is fired from her job and goes to the Underground station to catch a train home. It is at this point that the plot splits into two parallel universes. One plot line shows what happens to Helen if she catches the train; the other what happens to her if she misses it. The film's title refers to the doors of the train which slide shut before Helen can enter (or, alternately, remain open for her).In one timeline, Helen catches the train and returns home in time to catch her boyfriend Gerry in bed with another woman, Lydia. She dumps Gerry, moves in with her best friend Anna, and begins a romance with another man named James. In the second timeline Helen misses the train and is delayed getting home, which means that she does not catch Gerry and Lydia together. She continues her relationship with Gerry, unaware that he is cheating on her.The two plot lines run in tandem, with frequent switches from the James timeline to the Gerry one, and the story could easily have become very confusing. Fortunately, director Peter Howitt handles his material well, and the two parallel stories remain easy to follow, especially as Gwyneth Paltrow has a different hairstyle in each timeline. Howitt was previously best known to me as the star of the late eighties sitcom Bread; Sliding Doors was his first film as director. (He also wrote the script).The film is essentially a romantic comedy with a metaphysical twist. The James timeline, in particular, contains many traditional rom-com features, such as the misunderstanding which threatens the happiness of the lovers but is later overcome. Indeed, I would rate it as one of the two best British romantic comedies of the nineties, the other being Four Weddings and a Funeral. Both films pair a British leading man with an American leading lady, as did another successful British rom-com from the period, Notting Hill. Another link between them is that John Hannah, who stars as James here, also appeared in the earlier film. Sliding Doors was a rare opportunity for Hannah to take a leading role; I have normally thought of him as a supporting actor, as in Four Weddings or the various Mummy films.Paltrow is one of the few American actors who can play a British character convincingly, and she gets another chance to use the accent she had perfected for Emma and was to use later in the same year in Shakespeare in Love. Helen not only sounds convincingly British, she also sounds like a middle-class Londoner. Paltrow resists the temptation either to make her character too upper-class like Natalie Portman in V for Vendetta or to retreat into a faux-Cockney like Patricia Arquette in The Secret Agent. More important than the accent is the fact that she makes Helen a warm, sympathetic and lovable heroine. Although she was to win an Oscar for Shakespeare in Love, I felt that her performance in Sliding Doors was easily the better of the two. Not that the Academy, of course, hand out Oscars for anything done in small-scale independent British films.The dialogue is often very witty, unlike some rom-coms which tend to concentrate on the romance at the expense of the comedy.

To call this a delightful musical would be tantamount to stating the obvious but then that's precisely what this piece of cinema is and in pronouncing this most British of words, one is probably summing up the movie experience. As such it belongs to that select category of films that attain perfection by way of charming their audience. There are scenes and songs one might chop out of the equation for the sake of brevity but none that would make it any better. The usual rules of cinematic expression do not apply to musicals and they certainly don't hold for 'My Fair Lady'.An adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same name, in turn based on George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion, the film involves the efforts of Prof. Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison), a phonetics expert, high browed and misogynistic, to pass off a common flower girl, Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) (so deliciously low) as a Duchess at an embassy ball.The now inimitable Rex Harrison - Audrey Hepburn combine are a treat to watch, especially Hepburn. Even when you consider the fact that Julie Andrews played Eliza Doolittle in the Broadway production it's hard to imagine anyone but Audrey Hepburn essaying Eliza. Early in the film, she resorts to rebuffs employing facial gestures and 'guttural sounds'. Later, when confronted by the issue of identity, she deals with it and exacts her own in clinical lady-like fashion! The transformation, even though given the slightest of treatments, makes for compelling viewing primarily because of Hepburn's ability to breathe a bit of her own grace and poise into end personae that could have, in lesser hands, become caricatures. In fact, Rex Harrison's Henry Higgins very nearly veers off into this territory. One isn't sure whether it is the disinterested actor (he was initially hesitant on reprising the role on film) or the fact that this is a character with such clear delineation, leaving little room for improvisation. In the end, it is the post-ball scenes that call for Harrison to step up and though you are with Hepburn towards the end, you can't help but sympathize with the former's attempts at portraying the predicament of having to reevaluate his attitude towards a person who's very nearly his own creation. He does so and these scenes probably landed him the Academy Award (given the jury's fondness for musicals it would have been his either way).Lacing all this are the songs by the Lerner-Loewe duo. Alan Jay Lerner (lyricist) and Frederick 'Fritz' Loewe (composer) hit all the right notes and the result is the most popular of what are known as the 'Lerner-Loewe Musicals' (Gigi, Camelot, Brigadoon, Paint My Wagon). Lerner's insistence at taking weeks for a line or two hints at an obsession for the right verse but it pays off here and how! 'All I want is a room somewhere' and 'Just you white' are now part of popular culture. Lines like 'The French don't care how a thing's done as long as they pronounce it correctly' reflect well upon Lerner's oeuvre. Loewe's tunes log themselves instantly in the conscious in spite of Harrison's voicing rather than singing the songs.

All in all this film isn't anything special, Sean Connery debuts as agent 007 with suave sophisatication and Joseph Wiseman proves to be a worthy adversary for the secret agent.The 5 things I LIKE about this film 1) Sean Connery, the man that made agent 007 a household name plays the part like no other man on the planet could, his seamless performance adds to the film's credibility and looks as if he has been playing the part for years. No other actor has beaten his performance since 2) The best bond girl ever, Ursula Andress is sizzling as Honey Ryder and sets the standard for future bond girls.3) The use of the classic James Bond Theme. Monty Norman's simple yet effective theme is used in the titles sequence and as a recurrent motif when Bond is on the screen. It is a shame that future bond films have strayed away from using this classic theme.4) The line Bond James Bond is first pronounced by Connery and is the definite highlight of this film, you feel a shiver down your spine when he delivers this famous one liner.5) The villain Dr. No, Although not in the film a lot and not a dominant screen time character. His presence is certainly felt throughout the film building the suspense in the final showdown with Bond.Five things that I HATED about this film; 1) The gunshots and sound effects in this film are appalling and are certainly the worst of the entire series, luckily the film-makers redeemed themselves in later films by incorporating far more believable sound effects.2) The character of Sylvia Trench, this character is unnecessary and I was glad that the idea of her character hooking up with bond before he sets off before each escapade was dropped after From Russia with Love.3)The locations, having only one location in this film (Jamaica) certainly lessens the scale of the whole piece and sets the story in just one country which makes the film less interesting as in later films the tradition is that Bond travels around the world to pursue his adversary\/s 4) The idea of the Dragon on Crab key, this is just lame and stupid, the idea of a dragon on a remote island sounds good but the way it is executed in the film is absolutely pathetic and I woudn't be surprised if Connery himself would have laughed at the idea whilst reading the script or filming the specific scene.5) Finally, the thing I hate most about this film is the dubbing of certain characters. (eg. Honey Ryder, John Strangways) why couldn't they just leave them as they were?

The two go on a cruise across the world where he ends up falling in love with a princess and she ends up in the arms of another man. This early film from Hitchcock certainly isn't amongst his best but it is a rather nice blend of drama and some black comedy thrown in. The biggest problem is that even by 1931 standards this thing here is pretty old fashioned and rather bland storywise. Throughout the silent era we saw countless films dealing with happy couples turning sour after money is brought into their lives and the story here really doesn't add anything new. What it does add is a great final fifteen-minutes where we really get to see Hitchcock explode as a director and turn into that Master of Suspense.

His successful girlfriend despairs but being in the right place at the wrong time sees Jonathan save department store owner Claire Timkin from injury and land himself a job. In this store he finds a mannequin that he once put together in a previous lost job and, while alone with her, she comes to life, revealing herself to be an Egypian princess that the gods have allowed to be alive only for him. The two of them cavort the night away and, by morning have redesigned the window display of designer Hollywood. The window is a hit and Jonathan is employed to keep it coming and draw the crowds to the store. Meanwhile a rival store tries to scupper Jonathan's success and everyone begins to have their suspicions about the amount of time Jonathan spends with his mannequin.If the cheapness of the opening scene and the horrid cartoon titles don't tell you that this is a cheap and cheesy 80's movie then I would guess it is because you have never seen a movie from the 80's because Mannequin is so very of its period that it should be sealed in concrete for future generations to look back on. Having last seen it about 20 years ago, my gf and I decided to watch it again recently &#x96; but not with the nostalgic impression of quality that many seem to have when reflecting back on the film having not seen it since childhood. The first thing to really get into your head is that the title sequence is supposed to get you into the zone in terms of quality. I say this because the majority of the film feels cheaply made without a lot of care and attention to the plot, characters or even look of the film. Somehow though, it just about manages to have enough wacky charm to it to make it work &#x96; but please note I say just about because it is a pretty daft affair that doesn't deliver enough laughs to totally cover it if you are in anything other than a totally accepting mood.The silliness and the sheer wall-to-wall eighties-ness of the whole thing does give it a certain amount of charm as well, since it is very much of its time &#x96; this is not the same as it being good but it does bring something to the table that has come with time. Having said that though, while I can accept the attitudes and the fashions, one thing I find hard to accept is that Andrew McCarthy was once considered to be bankable by anybody. He is unconvincing in his role and has nowhere near the charisma required to carry the lead role. Certainly he doesn't fit with Kim Cattrall who, although handed an impossible role, gives her all at every point in the film. Support from Getty is nice while Spader hams it up and adds to the silly appeal of the film. Bailey does his Police Academy turn with reasonable success while Taylor is a squealing, fabulous cliché but yet does add colour to the film.Mannequin is far from being a good film but it is not as awful as some grumps on here would have you believe. Incredibly 80's throughout and with low quality standards across the board, the wacky aspect and the silly screwball comedy does sort of bring enough to the party to make it easy watching.

And the trouble is - it shows.The rather nihilistic post-apocalyptic scenario that starred Mel Gibson is reprised on the oceans by the thinking-man's Donald Duck Kevin Costner, who directed and starred in it. So much of what we see appears to have been lifted and marinised from the Mad Max franchise that I'm surprised Costner wasn't sued for plagiarism of intellectual copyright. Perhaps he bought them off. That said, it may be that the scenarios presented in either movie are a fairly accurate portrayal of how our species would behave.Whatever the case, I think the first half is extremely entertaining, with some very imaginative Heath-Robinson contrivances and gadgets. I particularly like the Mariner's trimaran. Costner's Mariner is an interesting character, more subtly played than Gibson's 'Max'. Whilst Dennis Hopper makes a humorously wicked Captain Hook-alike. The rest of the cast just come along for the sail.There's plenty of action and it's well choreographed. Incidental music is aptly chosen to accentuate the drama of the moment. Lighting, editing, camera-work and other technical issues are all up to snuff. But - something's missing.From about halfway through it begins to drag. The plot seems to lose focus. The conflict and tension don't build in the way that a good action thriller should. Maybe it's Costner himself. He just isn't the action man that he likes to present himself as. I thought he cocked-up his telling of Robin Hood in broadly the same way.Even so, this is a movie that deserves more credit than it got, I think. Despite its rather dull one-dimensional star, there's plenty going on for most of the ride that will entertain. I also think it would deserve a PG rating, there's little that would jar the sensibilities of younger children. Sex and swearing are almost non-existent. Basically it's a good family movie - Peter Pan, with an edge. As to the 'Waterworld' scenario; there isn't enough ice on the poles and all the mountains to sink the land-masses so completely as envisaged. Neither could the terrestrial heroine go deep-diving the way she did. But what the heck. ","genre":null},{"date":"6 June 2009","score":"","review":" Yes; it's 'Mad Max 2' at sea.

I thought he cocked-up his telling of Robin Hood in broadly the same way.Even so, this is a movie that deserves more credit than it got, I think. Despite its rather dull one-dimensional star, there's plenty going on for most of the ride that will entertain. I also think it would deserve a PG rating, there's little that would jar the sensibilities of younger children. Sex and swearing are almost non-existent.

And the trouble is - it shows.The rather nihilistic post-apocalyptic scenario that starred Mel Gibson is reprised on the oceans by the thinking-man's Donald Duck Kevin Costner, who directed and starred in it. So much of what we see appears to have been lifted and marinised from the Mad Max franchise that I'm surprised Costner wasn't sued for plagiarism of intellectual copyright. Perhaps he bought them off.

The third film in the series regarding the psycho doll possessed with the spirit of serial killer Charles Lee Ray needing a human host to exit from his plastic shell. After being resurrected from the doll factory via blood dripping from the damaged plastic(..Chucky's destruction in the previous film), Chucky kills the business executive who decided to start up the manufacturing of Good Guy toys, discovering that old nemesis Andy(Justin Whalin) is much older, shipped to a military school after spending time in multiple foster homes. Chucky finds another candidate in a young black boy, Tyler(Jeremy Sylvers) who Andy must protect, but this will be difficult because of Cadet Lt Col Brett C Shelton(Travis Fine), his commanding officer who makes life especially hard for new recruits. Shelton is simply a bullying thug allowed to treat certain cadets he doesn't like harshly, hiding behind his rank. Meanwhile, Chucky tricks Tyler into believing they're friends with Andy having to figure out ways to rescue him. Chucky, also, kills a few characters around the Kent military school for fun.There are essentially three acts to the film. The first act primarily consists of Andy's troubles adjusting to his new environment as Chucky roams around using his doll disguise as a means to startle victims before killing them. One victim, a garbage man hears Chucky's cries for help, hops into the truck's hopper to find him and is crushed inside(Chucky is able to escape quietly without the garbage man knowing) by the doll with no way to escape. Col Cochran(..the man in charge of the military school, who informs Andy that his place turns bed-wetters into men) actually has a heart attack when Chucky draws a hunting knife, not exactly a flattering way for such a decorated soldier's life to end. A third plans to give Chucky a hair cut(!)falling victim to a straight razor. The second act occurs in the woods near the school where a blue and red team, conducted of the cadets and their leaders, take part in a paint ball exercise with Chucky targeting Tyler(..red team)with Andy(..blue team, under Shelton's command, of course)having to abandon his team in order to save the kid. Chucky actually loaded the red team's rifles with actual rounds, resulting in an accidental murder, also threatening the life of Kristen(Perrey Reeves), Andy's love interest(..also part of blue team)with a grenade if Tyler(..who finally understands why Andy was warning him about Chucky)isn't handed over. A cadet gives his life when Chucky hurls his live grenade at the students. The third act involves the main principles, Andy and Kristen chasing after Chucky(..who has taken Tyler prisoner with a small gun found in the drawer of a security guard's desk)into a carnival outside the woods, with the climax taking place in a spooky funhouse ride.This film certainly was the low point in a series that seemed to digress in quality from one sequel to the next. Chucky tosses out lots of quips after murdering folks, which I admit to grinning at amusingly, but I found the overall film rather tiresome and the kills are relatively tame. The next two films, a far cry from the series which focused on Chucky terrorizing Andy, take a giant leap in terms of originality and casting. The casting in this film is rather colorless for the exception of Andrew Robinson as a military barber with a few screws loose(..who definitely has pride in his work)and Brad Dourif providing the enthusiastic voice of Chucky who thoroughly enjoys murdering people. I must admit that the use of a yo-yo to strangle a victim is rather unique. Dean Jacobson is cadet Whitehurst, an object of ridicule for Shelton who constantly berates him(..among others).

The third act involves the main principles, Andy and Kristen chasing after Chucky(..who has taken Tyler prisoner with a small gun found in the drawer of a security guard's desk)into a carnival outside the woods, with the climax taking place in a spooky funhouse ride.This film certainly was the low point in a series that seemed to digress in quality from one sequel to the next. Chucky tosses out lots of quips after murdering folks, which I admit to grinning at amusingly, but I found the overall film rather tiresome and the kills are relatively tame. The next two films, a far cry from the series which focused on Chucky terrorizing Andy, take a giant leap in terms of originality and casting. The casting in this film is rather colorless for the exception of Andrew Robinson as a military barber with a few screws loose(..who definitely has pride in his work)and Brad Dourif providing the enthusiastic voice of Chucky who thoroughly enjoys murdering people. I must admit that the use of a yo-yo to strangle a victim is rather unique. Dean Jacobson is cadet Whitehurst, an object of ridicule for Shelton who constantly berates him(..among others). Peter Haskell is Sullivan, the businessman who restarts the factory that led to Chucky's rebirth. Chucky's colorful language might earn giggles.

The Japanese fly in, they sink the American ships, they fly out again. Japs one, Yanks nil. No American audience is likely to take kindly to a film which ends with that particular scoreline. Although the attack was not as decisive a victory as the Japanese high command had been hoping for (only two out of eight American battleships, the USS Arizona and the USS Oklahoma, were permanently put out of action), it was nevertheless an American defeat. The solution adopted by producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay was to make the attack itself the central act of a three-act drama. Act I, hoping to copy the Titanic formula of adding a fictional human-interest story to the spectacular recreation of a real historical event, deals with a love triangle between two American pilots and a Navy nurse. The story opens early in 1941 when Lieutenant Rafe McCawley, an American Army Air Force pilot, volunteers to serve with the Royal Air Force's Eagle Squadrons. Later, he is shot down in combat over the English Channel and is presumed killed in action. In fact, he has survived, and after three months in occupied France returns to his base at Pearl Harbor. (Exactly why he did not return to his squadron in Britain is not explained). Unfortunately, two people are less than overjoyed to see him - his best friend Danny Walker and his girlfriend Evelyn who, presuming him to have died, have commenced an affair during his absence and who make it quite clear that Rafe's unexpected return from the dead will have no effect upon their relationship. Unsurprisingly, this development causes a rift in Rafe and Danny's friendship (although, rather more surprisingly, the rift proves to be only temporary). Act II deals with the Pearl Harbor attack itself. Act III tells the story of the Doolittle Raid of April 1942, in which Rafe and Danny, by now once again the best of friends despite Danny's continuing affair with Evelyn, take part. (It is not explained how the two, originally fighter pilots, have now learned to fly bombers). According to the film this raid avenged America's defeat at Pearl Harbor and was a major turning-point in the Pacific War. Japs one, Yanks two. Actually, the Doolittle Raid, although undoubtedly daring, had little effect on the course of the war; the real turning-point came at the Battle of Midway two months later. Indeed, the film, and Jon Voight's rather over-the-top performance, inadvertently left me with the impression that the raid had been a piece of reckless bravado on the part of President Roosevelt who, desperate for a propaganda coup, was prepared to send America's carrier fleet into danger, even though he had been advised that it was needed to defend the West Coast against a possible invasion.The love-triangle story is unnecessary and overlong- indeed, it is the main reason why the film itself is overlong-, and the attempt to emulate Titanic falls flat. Although neither Leonardo di Caprio nor Kate Winslet gave a particularly good performance in that film, at least their characters Jack and Rose were two likable young people that the audience could empathise with. In Pearl Harbor, by contrast, Danny and Evelyn both come across as thoroughly unlikeable; shallow, self-centred and rather cruel in their treatment of Rafe. (Kate Beckinsale looks gorgeous, but this is not one of her better films). Of the three main characters, Rafe is the only one who engages our sympathy, and even in his case our sympathy is limited by the fact that he is played by the stiff and wooden Ben Affleck, the man with a bigger collection of turkeys than Bernard Matthews. Probably the most interesting way of making a film about the battle would be to explore the reasons why the Japanese leadership took such an insane gamble, but I suspect that American audiences would not be interested in a film which paid more attention to the enemy side rather than the American one. The portrayal of the Japanese characters is not as hostile as in some earlier films about the Pacific War (The Purple Heart being a notorious example) but even so it is rather perfunctory, and there is no serious attempt to trace the origins of the conflict. The action sequences are good, particularly those depicting the attack on Pearl Harbor itself, and are the main reason why have given the film an average rather than a below-average mark. Nevertheless, there is little else that is good about the film- not the plot line, not the script and not the acting (with a couple of honourable exceptions, notably Alec Baldwin as Jimmy Doolittle and Cuba Gooding, Jr. as the black navy cook who unexpectedly proves to be one of the heroes of the attack). Roger Ebert described the film as a two-hour movie squeezed into three hours, about how on December 7th 1941 the Japanese staged a surprise attack on an American love triangle. Bay called this the most offensive review he had received in his career, but to me it seems like fair comment. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 June 2009","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was one of the most important events in twentieth-century history, but from an American perspective it is a difficult one to film.
