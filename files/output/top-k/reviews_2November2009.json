However, the van gets into a horrible accident, skidding off the road and exploding. Predictably, Myers' body is nowhere to be found in the wreckage, alarming both the skeptical police and the indefatigable Dr. Loomis. Soon, Myers is spotted back in Haddonfield, and it becomes obvious that his next target is his young niece, Jamie.Let me start off by saying this I have not seen the sequel to the original film but I have seen the original film (who hasn't). I didn't really know what to expect because I just saw this film out of spontaneity and I was interested because Danielle Harris was in here, who was in the remake of HALLOWEEN. I didn't expect much and I got just that. Being the fourth film in the ever-so-popular franchise, HALLOWEEN 4 is better than most franchises would be in their fourth film and I'd expect it being a huge step up after HALLOWEEN 3. However, that's not saying much.Instead of Laurie Strode returning, we get her daughter. Now, this news may seem like the final nail to the coffin of the franchise, having a kid be in a starring role for such a popular franchise. Fortunately, however, Danielle Harris is not bad. In fact, she isn't that bad at all. She seems very mature for her age and you can tell by her performance. Ellie Cornell also did a good job in her role next to Harris. I can't say much for Donald Pleasence, though. I think he's getting tired in his role and if not, he should be.As for the movie itself, it just moves in a slow pace with a ho-hum feeling throughout. The kill scenes aren't really spectacular nor are the chase scenes thrilling. The final showdown isn't much to brag about either. The movie plays it extremely safe, I'm surprised to say. However, the last shot of the film is truly surprising and leaves a great cliffhanger for the next sequel, which I will write about very soon. I wish the whole movie were like the last shot.I really have nothing else to say about the film. Although carried by strong, young actors and ending in something unpredictable and eerie, HALLOWEEN 4 is really nothing to scream about. It plays it safe through and through and never really reaches its full potential to discover some new directions for the series to take. See it only if you're bored and when its on TV.

Director Johnathan Demme uses Clarice Starling played by Jodie Foster to play on Hannibal Lector's manipulating intelligence. Clarice is originally selected by the head of FBI's behavioral Science unit Jack Crawford to track down a notorious serial killer nicknamed Buffalo Bill. Crawford asks Clarice to meet with Dr. Hannibal Lector in order to find the whereabouts of buffalo bill. This constant interaction between Clarice and Dr. Lector makes for an exciting mind game played on both sides. Director Johnathan Demme's use of dark emphasis on reality combined with Anthony Hopkins assertive and sadistic abilities as an actor makes for great chemistry. Jodie Foster's matter a fact persona is presented as a challenge to Dr. Lector. This relationship is established at the beginning and continuously unraveled as the story progresses. On one occasion Clarice meets with Dr. Lector who is sitting behind bullet proof glass inside his windowless cell. Dr. Lector finds is release through the analysis of Clarice's life. Clarice uses her disturbing past to compensate for links to Buffalo Bill. Dr. Lector eventually falls for Clarice's pursuit and gives her a clue that leads to one of Dr. Lector's past patients. From this point Clarice takes her findings back to Dr. Lector in hopes of finding Buffalo Bill who has now abducted Catherine Martin, the daughter of Senator Ruth Martin. With the severity of the situation on Clarice's back she is forced to come up with an answer. Knowing this she makes a deal with Dr. Lector's request of transferring to a different facility in return for finding buffalo bill.Johnathan Demme brings a new definition to the word climax. Demme's use of scenery and dictation of characters like buffalo bill and Hannibal Lector seeks out an eerie pocket that most viewers are not used to experiencing. Camera angles and screen shots help to put you in the shoes of Clarice and buffalo bills hopeless victims. Although Clarice attempts to portray herself as a mentally tough FBI official we see Dr. Lector's tactics of recalling her childhood past begin to eat away at her. This struggle brings Clarice's true personality out which ties into a remarkable conclusion. Demme is attempting to bring you into the mind of mad genius. Through the harshness of reality seen in Clarice's past, Dr. Lector's actions and buffalo bills intentions we begin to think there is no hope. Demme brings you so far down into the plot that you begin to transcend your thoughts and emotions as those of the young lady trapped by Buffalo Bill. You have that real sense that you cannot expect a successful conclusion to the multi-dimensional plot as portrayed through multi-dimensional characters.

I will continue by saying this movie isn't awesome. To try to make sense of all this you should read the review.First of all this movie stars Rowdy Roddy Piper. I don't know if it's worse if you do or don't know who that is, but Rowdy Roddy Piper was a WWF wrestler in the era of Hulk Hogan back when there was still national debate about whether or not wrestling was fake. To imagine we used to live in a time where tards seriously believed wrestling was real is hard to believe, but those were simpler times when a black man entering a wrestling ring with a parrot on his shoulder while calling himself cocoa beware made sense.The movie is a little goofy, but still is somehow considered to be somewhat of an underground classic. The plot is the world is being controlled by aliens who look like normal humans unless you see them while wearing special sunglasses. Not a bad idea, but not a good idea either. Just an idea. The only purpose in being able to see who's an alien is for the sake of the movie. Seeing that the guy next to you buying the paper is an alien is pointless unless you take it upon yourself to murder his alien ass. Luckily Rowdy Roddy is the one person willing to do just that.The beginning of the movie is pretty slow and boring and mainly involves Piper removing his flannel shirt to do construction jobs and then going to live in a homeless shantytown. Since a movie about a homeless construction worker doing actual construction work would be terrible, rowdy roddy eventually discovers a church where rebels are making the special sunglasses.After putting on the sunglasses Roddy sees that some people appear to have alien faces when he's wearing them. And although nobody has actually explained to him what it even means to see random aliens while wearing sunglasses, within 10 minutes of first putting on the glasses he's already killing two cops who appear to have alien faces.Naturally Roddy has a hard time convincing others of this alien scheme he's discovered\/imagined, but he makes a very memorable effort to when he meets his friend Frank the next day in an alley. Roddy tries to put the sunglasses on Frank's face to make him see the truth, but Frank simply refuses to wear them. What takes place as a result is by far the most ridiculous and awesome fight in movie history. In a fight that just won't end Roddy and Frank beat each other for what seems like an eternity. The fight is so ridiculous and over the top that it inspired an entire episode of southpark where jimmy and timmy beat each other in an alley in the same way.Eventually Frank puts on the glasses and realizes Roddy was right and the rest of the movie is about Frank and Roddy fighting the aliens. They go the the alien headquarters via the use of some sort of star trek beaming device and proceed to murder everyone there whether they are alien guards, alien office workers, or humans.All of this murder is great and necessary to keep you from give up on watching the movie, but the act of stopping the aliens is basically pointless. There's a vague explanation saying the aliens came to this planet to use it's resources, but that doesn't even make sense when you put it in the context of this movie. The dirty aliens technically use our resources through normal living just like we do, but they're not using them at an alarming rate or anything. So rather than being diabolical they're really just being a-holes by not sharing any of their alien technology with us. In summary this movie may deserve its underground cult status or it may be a pile of garbage. Which side of the fence you land on regarding that depends on how much you love wrestling and aliens. If you love aliens actually wrestling then you'll be disappointed for sure. If you would love to wrestle an alien yourself then you should spend more time finding a way to make contact with aliens and less time watching movies.

And although nobody has actually explained to him what it even means to see random aliens while wearing sunglasses, within 10 minutes of first putting on the glasses he's already killing two cops who appear to have alien faces.Naturally Roddy has a hard time convincing others of this alien scheme he's discovered\/imagined, but he makes a very memorable effort to when he meets his friend Frank the next day in an alley. Roddy tries to put the sunglasses on Frank's face to make him see the truth, but Frank simply refuses to wear them. What takes place as a result is by far the most ridiculous and awesome fight in movie history. In a fight that just won't end Roddy and Frank beat each other for what seems like an eternity. The fight is so ridiculous and over the top that it inspired an entire episode of southpark where jimmy and timmy beat each other in an alley in the same way.Eventually Frank puts on the glasses and realizes Roddy was right and the rest of the movie is about Frank and Roddy fighting the aliens. They go the the alien headquarters via the use of some sort of star trek beaming device and proceed to murder everyone there whether they are alien guards, alien office workers, or humans.All of this murder is great and necessary to keep you from give up on watching the movie, but the act of stopping the aliens is basically pointless. There's a vague explanation saying the aliens came to this planet to use it's resources, but that doesn't even make sense when you put it in the context of this movie. The dirty aliens technically use our resources through normal living just like we do, but they're not using them at an alarming rate or anything. So rather than being diabolical they're really just being a-holes by not sharing any of their alien technology with us. In summary this movie may deserve its underground cult status or it may be a pile of garbage. Which side of the fence you land on regarding that depends on how much you love wrestling and aliens. If you love aliens actually wrestling then you'll be disappointed for sure. If you would love to wrestle an alien yourself then you should spend more time finding a way to make contact with aliens and less time watching movies.
