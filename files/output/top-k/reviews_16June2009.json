This makes no logical sense. Another example is when, Danira who is Perhan's sister, sees her mother's veil flying in the air. Later we see the flying veil before Azra gives birth and levitates.

It's a scene that encapsulates the romance, the beauty and the ugliness that is the cornerstone of the movie. The first thing I should really say about this film is how much I love it. To me it is a superb slice of film-making from a man who, at this point in his career and twenty years after the masterpiece that put him on the map, was not regarded as highly as he once was, at least in terms of the films he was currently making at that time. Certainly his previous film, prior to this, was the third installment of his Godfather series and that was a film that divided just about everybody based on whether or not it was a necessary film, to plot developments right through to the casting of the actress playing Al Pacino's daughter.Admittedly, and I will be the first one to say so, there are some issues here to be had. Some of the performances, or more so, the accents of some of the performers leave a lot to be desired, and yes, I'm looking at you Keanu Reeves. There are moments where one does expect an utterance of the line it's the Count dude, and while, thankfully, we never get that, it says a lot about said accent that no matter how many times one watches this film, you can't help but expect it. The whole aura of the film also feels over the top at times, the bloodletting, the overt sexuality (Sadie Frost's performance as Lucy comes across as a walking orgasm for most of the film, but this only seems to add to the fun considering the character comes across as nymphomaniac even before she becomes a vampire) and Anthony Hopkins' accent, but it works in the spirit of the film. What does work triumphantly well are the performances of the two leads. Gary Oldman, probably one of the best actors working today in film, and Winona Ryder, forever and always my favourite actress despite her inability, supposedly, to pay for her shopping, sell the love story of Dracula and Mina in a way that is almost heartbreaking beyond belief, with furtive glances, genuinely moving chemistry without resorting to playing it in a I want to remove your clothes now sort of a way, is backed by sensitive direction from Coppola and a terrific music score that never intrudes and tells the audience how to feel, instead complimenting the emotion on screen. Winona's performance is beautiful and understated, as always, selling you her character's feelings and thoughts without overplaying it, whilst Oldman, seemingly, until the Christopher Nolan Batman films came along, forever and always playing villains, actually gives us a villain, although not as black and white as that description would suggest, that you want to root for, a man who has fallen into darkness based on an emotional loss that in turn places all those he comes into contact with into a similar place but who eventually fulfils a redemption in those haunting, final moments.The best performance could be held over for Francis Ford Coppola, here working as a director for hire in a studio film, but making it, as he always has done, through his own personal eyes. Instead of relying on modern technology available at the time, Coppola utilized old fashioned filming techniques and technology that was only available during the birth of cinema to present his vision of the tale. Old fashioned models, in camera trickery with not even a whiff of CGI. It's refreshing and original and brilliant. Of course not everyone will speak of the film in the same breath as the Corelone's or the Kurtz's but to me this is a crowning achievement, despite some bad judgments (again, I look to you Keanu Reeves), from a director who we all have to thank for the cinema that we have.

From the screenplay by Viktor Rozov, based on his own play, Kalatozov shows us a vision of the heroism of war and the suffering by those left at home. Inundated with countless war movies showing us the frontlines and the carnage, the topic itself becomes tedious and avoidable. However, this Russian gem shows how the tale of hardship can be told in a different way; by telling us, straight from a soldier's mouth how war is hated by all, that they hope those who died did so for a cause that will allow for peace and the end of fighting, we see a new vision of WWII. We have young men volunteering to wage war for peace, to keep their families and loved ones safe at home rather than draftees fighting a battle they don't believe in. With so much hatred towards our current situation in the Middle East, and how people are dying for no reason, against their will, it's nice to see a film that shows just how selfless and heroic these soldiers are, as well as those awaiting their return.Communist Russia shows how involved all were in the war. While Boris may have volunteered to go to the frontlines, his father is head doctor of a hospital aiding in the mending of soldiers injured and his sister is helping him there as well as his girl Veronika, doing all she can to keep her mind off the fact that no letter has arrived from her love. An entire city comes out to send the boys off in celebration. Even the factory that Boris and his friend Stepan work for send representatives over with gifts of gratitude. Whether this is all a glorified look into Russia at the outset of WWII or not, I don't know. There are no protests or badmouthing of these boys risking their lives for a country, it is all praise and thanks. Some in America could learn a lesson from this because whether you agree with the war at hand or not, protesting and wreaking havoc in its name only sullies what these men and women are sacrificing each and everyday.The acting is top-notch throughout, but some deserve singling out. I really enjoyed Antonina Bogdanova in a small role as Boris' grandmother. She is the one family member he can trust and her sadness at his leaving is very evident on her face and through her body language. Vasili Merkuryev, as the patriarch Fyodor Ivanovich, brings what is perhaps the best performance. As spoken at the end, about fathers needing to choke back hidden tears, Merkuryev epitomizes those sentiments. He puts on a tough exterior, especially cracking jokes and riding his son hard when he finds out about his volunteering just hours before he must leave. But when Boris exits to go to the assembly station we see the true pain of the man, seated in sorrow at the table. He loves his son dearly and although he may not be able to show it to him, his actions throughout the film express it to the audience. Aleksey Batalov is effective as Boris, a happy-go-lucky young man, and idealist, doing what he believes is right, and Aleksandr Shvorin is good as the villainous Mark, staying home due to his talented piano skills, or maybe just to steal his cousin's love. That love, played by Tatyana Samojlova, really draws the audience in to her grief, dejection, and slim glimmer of hope. The true star of the film, she must go through many emotions on a journey where she does lose her way, needing to steer back on course, hoping that she did so soon enough for Boris' return.Besides the realism to the story, as well as being unafraid to use tragedy to get the theme across, I also loved the visual style of the film. Sergei Urusevsky's cinematography is amazing, especially when considering the movie was shot in fullscreen. It is one thing to create stunning compositions in a widescreen panorama; it is completely different to do so in a square frame. Right from the beginning we get a beautiful static shot of a winding walkway along water, a bridge in the background at the top, as our two lovers skip their way up the screen and into the distance. There are multiple instances of the camera being behind barriers yet still allowing for the action to be seen, creating unique spatial depth and interest at all times. Sharp angles are utilized, as well as careful blocking to allow for overhead shots and exaggerated juxtapositions of characters in frame together.The real feats, however, are those instances of the long shot. Used well towards the end to follow Veronika through the mass of returning soldiers, it is magnificent earlier on as she roams through those saying goodbye to their loved ones while she searches for Boris, her own farewell needing to be said. The planning for this shot must have been extensive because while she weaves in and out of people, the camera focuses on couples kisses, people yelling to one another, and more, all purposely in frame at specific moments while the camera moves through. Everyone needed to hit his mark precisely and it leads to a brilliant piece of cinema. It's just one part of an overall masterpiece of tone and style; The Cranes are Flying shows how successful placement and mise en scène can be in showing the audience what it needs in as simple a way as possible. Composition and professionalism from the actors and crew can work wonders, adding something that huge setpieces and special effects can never do.

She is the one family member he can trust and her sadness at his leaving is very evident on her face and through her body language. Vasili Merkuryev, as the patriarch Fyodor Ivanovich, brings what is perhaps the best performance. As spoken at the end, about fathers needing to choke back hidden tears, Merkuryev epitomizes those sentiments. He puts on a tough exterior, especially cracking jokes and riding his son hard when he finds out about his volunteering just hours before he must leave. But when Boris exits to go to the assembly station we see the true pain of the man, seated in sorrow at the table. He loves his son dearly and although he may not be able to show it to him, his actions throughout the film express it to the audience. Aleksey Batalov is effective as Boris, a happy-go-lucky young man, and idealist, doing what he believes is right, and Aleksandr Shvorin is good as the villainous Mark, staying home due to his talented piano skills, or maybe just to steal his cousin's love. That love, played by Tatyana Samojlova, really draws the audience in to her grief, dejection, and slim glimmer of hope. The true star of the film, she must go through many emotions on a journey where she does lose her way, needing to steer back on course, hoping that she did so soon enough for Boris' return.Besides the realism to the story, as well as being unafraid to use tragedy to get the theme across, I also loved the visual style of the film. Sergei Urusevsky's cinematography is amazing, especially when considering the movie was shot in fullscreen. It is one thing to create stunning compositions in a widescreen panorama; it is completely different to do so in a square frame. Right from the beginning we get a beautiful static shot of a winding walkway along water, a bridge in the background at the top, as our two lovers skip their way up the screen and into the distance. There are multiple instances of the camera being behind barriers yet still allowing for the action to be seen, creating unique spatial depth and interest at all times. Sharp angles are utilized, as well as careful blocking to allow for overhead shots and exaggerated juxtapositions of characters in frame together.The real feats, however, are those instances of the long shot. Used well towards the end to follow Veronika through the mass of returning soldiers, it is magnificent earlier on as she roams through those saying goodbye to their loved ones while she searches for Boris, her own farewell needing to be said. The planning for this shot must have been extensive because while she weaves in and out of people, the camera focuses on couples kisses, people yelling to one another, and more, all purposely in frame at specific moments while the camera moves through. Everyone needed to hit his mark precisely and it leads to a brilliant piece of cinema. It's just one part of an overall masterpiece of tone and style; The Cranes are Flying shows how successful placement and mise en scène can be in showing the audience what it needs in as simple a way as possible.

From the screenplay by Viktor Rozov, based on his own play, Kalatozov shows us a vision of the heroism of war and the suffering by those left at home. Inundated with countless war movies showing us the frontlines and the carnage, the topic itself becomes tedious and avoidable. However, this Russian gem shows how the tale of hardship can be told in a different way; by telling us, straight from a soldier's mouth how war is hated by all, that they hope those who died did so for a cause that will allow for peace and the end of fighting, we see a new vision of WWII. We have young men volunteering to wage war for peace, to keep their families and loved ones safe at home rather than draftees fighting a battle they don't believe in. With so much hatred towards our current situation in the Middle East, and how people are dying for no reason, against their will, it's nice to see a film that shows just how selfless and heroic these soldiers are, as well as those awaiting their return.Communist Russia shows how involved all were in the war. While Boris may have volunteered to go to the frontlines, his father is head doctor of a hospital aiding in the mending of soldiers injured and his sister is helping him there as well as his girl Veronika, doing all she can to keep her mind off the fact that no letter has arrived from her love. An entire city comes out to send the boys off in celebration. Even the factory that Boris and his friend Stepan work for send representatives over with gifts of gratitude. Whether this is all a glorified look into Russia at the outset of WWII or not, I don't know. There are no protests or badmouthing of these boys risking their lives for a country, it is all praise and thanks. Some in America could learn a lesson from this because whether you agree with the war at hand or not, protesting and wreaking havoc in its name only sullies what these men and women are sacrificing each and everyday.The acting is top-notch throughout, but some deserve singling out.

Unfortunately, the film never establishes itself as camp, or indeed anything. It's pointless. There being little to add to the dissection of this film's problems, let's concentrate for a second on how a script this revolting gets made into a film this unsatisfying.Firstly, you have to have a screenwriter who really wants to make a point about how he understands the original. But another trait he has to have is that he doesn't think many other people understand the original. Then, you have to have him working with a culture he doesn't understand. How Sharon Stone got a job in a Catholic boarding school is amazing! Let alone how Palmintieri could stand over his dying wife, or how a boy could break through into the headmaster's quarters, witness the entire scene, and not be sent away. I had nine years in boarding school, and not once, thankfully, did I get to see my headmaster bare-chested. I can understand the chap's fascination with his naked language teacher, and it's very plausible he might find his way to a window to watch from a distance, but he must be the most intuitive, caring boy in the world to have grasped that something was very wrong - and then, if he had done so, he would have gone straight for that adult that Palmintieri has to tell him to go and find. Perhaps he is desperately in love with Miss Adjani. Whatever.Then you have two other awful, awful pieces of writing\/casting. (a) the video team - straight out of the 'Titanic' school of cheeky-chappy enthusiasts who say dude all the time and really don't give a fiddler's toss about anything other than the geeky enjoyment their jobs bring them. This kind of embarrasiing stereotyping wiped at least a star off my rating of 'Lock, Stock' (the scousers) and it's just insulting to camera technicians everywhere. Hollywood's presentation of enthusiasts has often been has often been unkind in a 'let's laugh at them' kind of way; here,it's unwatchable. And (b) the other members of staff. You kind of wish the two girls could have chosen their victims more wisely. That would have made the ending much more acceptable. While they were about it, they could also have knocked off that bug-eyed monster whom someone has come back later on in order to introduce a mystery element with the sunglasses.Then, you MUST have a director who wants to refer back to the original with as many 'atmosphere shots' as he can find. Probably in homage to it, but again, with no real point. In the original, the dripping tap serves a purpose of heightening the atmosphere of tension. In this film, there IS no tension until right near the end, when KB is wandering through the garage. But why is she wandering through the garage? So the director can 'explain' where Palmintieri has been hiding all this time.By trying to do the original film homage while making his own point about what a great scriptwriter he is (is he?) or what a great director he is (is he?), the person or persons most responsible for this film, clearly told to cut down on the length of the original, never pauses long enough to let anything sink in. Thus the rhythm of the piece goes sideways. And I found myself thinking there must have been a moment during production when some studio heads said, But, you see, we MUST have some violence, and a chase, some nudity and a sex scene. What began life as a vicious rape of his wife in the 50s classic becomes a ludicrous idea in this, effortlessly summarised by another reviewer here (thank you sir) as words to the effect of, He terrorises and humiliates her so much that she has to shag him. I must say, though, Stone and Bates give class performances where and when they can - it's just Stone belongs in another film entirely, and Bates is given some classic quips but becomes a pawn in the filmmakers' race for the perfect, satisfying ending.

Growing up more or less together, all three start out as gang bangers, but each has a different destiny and in many ways one's destiny is caused by the actions of the others.Borrego gets injured in a gang retaliation and works hard to not become a cripple.

This movie was only made as a quick cash grab, which just ended up being a flop anyway. The movie really bad too as awesome as the idea of Jason Voorhees in space should be.At least Kane Hodder is back as Jason, so that's a little bit of credit because he happens to be the coolest one to play the serial killer. Still in Jason X, he brings almost nothing to the movie.Pretty much, Jason comes back to life, in space this time, and he attacks, then is frozen. He is thawed in the year 2455, by plenty of attractive twenty-something astronauts. Eventually, he'll be picking em' off one by one until there's no more left and that's expected of him.The issue here is that we never even care about the characters for a second. No one is that likable because there was almost no character building. It's shocking that the characters even have names rather than just Girl #1, Boy #1. When they die, maybe we can say that it was a pretty cool kill but we really never feel for the characters that it's at all important to us when that happens.Another obvious problem with the movie is special effects. You would think that a movie set in space would have great special effects, especially considered what was available to them in the early 2000's. Everything in here looks fake especially all the outer space scenes.I also wanted to mention that it's crazy that the hockey mask pretty much changes in every film and in this film it is very round shaped and looks really ridiculous. It's strange to nitpick tiny things like the shape of the mask but it looks odd compared to the other great ones and a lot less scary. When he turns into the cyborg Jason, it's definitely a much better look for him as he is powerful, but it still isn't that scary.

But a set-up isn't enough to carry a film on its own, and the reason Final Destination works so well is that the film-makers don't rely on their fantastic concept to push the movie. In less-capable hands, this story would have been a rote 10 Little Indians kill cycle, but by integrating genuine suspense and boundless creativity into the proceedings, Final Destination falls somewhere much closer to the category of modern classic.Without recounting the plot, the core premise here is that no one can cheat death, and that by challenging fate, we oppose powers far beyond our control or understanding. The survivors who get off of doomed Flight 180 are perfect essays for the range of human reactions to the inevitability of death. Some leave the plane in a panic, like those among us who fear death to the extent that we let this fear lead us through our lives and out of situations that may contribute to whatever nasty end we imagine is in store for us. Much more interesting, the others who disembark the jet before its inevitable destruction are led away from their fate by simple twists of chance, each with a series of minor actions that test the fabric of fate just enough to forge their unnatural survival of an event they were destined to perish in.This complex but identifiable crux is why Final Destination is such a masterfully-rendered work of horror. We've all had those moments in our life where a seemingly random series of events culminates in a significant occurrence. It's quite natural to question what forces are at work in these instances, and how many variables were required to lead us to the conclusion we face.According to Final Destination, the force at work here is Death, itself. And this Death is a relentless shadow that uses pure elements like water and fire (again, simple fears) to create extravagant macabre Rube Goldberg devices to carry out its task. The way each individual piece of these machinations relates to something most of us would consider mundane (a leaky water line, a crack in a glass) heightens the powerful horror that permeates the film. After all, these victims aren't doing things we would never do and creating their demises by irresponsible actions; they are in situations that could actually happen to us, and the brilliantly slow and suspenseful set-ups that accompany each death force us to question would WE notice the dripping water that eventually leads to our death? The scenes in the airport at the beginning of the film are particularly gripping. The dread is built though a series of subtle images that don't look at all out of place in the airport (the departure board, the words final destination on the ticket), yet something about them is askew (note that the number on the luggage cart that drives beneath the plane as the characters board is 666, for instance). This series of little coincidences are all things that many of us would never pay attention to, or even notice to begin with, but if we saw them all as our main character does, could we draw any other conclusion than the one he realizes?Of course, there is also a lot to be said for the gleefully orchestrated carnage that keeps the pulse of the film steadily pumping. The plane crash is a truly shocking set-piece; chances are, no one reading this has been in one, but seeing it unfold on this screen, we get the sense that not only could the film-makers' scenario happen, it would probably happen EXACTLY like we see it here.Even knowing what's coming doesn't prepare the viewer for some of the more carefully-plotted gotcha moments. (If you aren't caught off guard by the bus hit, I'm guessing you have the same semi-psychic sense that drives our main character to get off the plane to begin with). By mixing in the right amount of carnage, and making it as over the top as the story allows, the film strikes a great balance between tension and release, a tenuous and not-often-realized phenomenon that classifies most of the best horror films of all time.This is not a perfect film, by any means. FD has flaws both minor (Clear Rivers is one of the worst film character names of all time) and major (the entire FBI subplot, and the wholly unrealistic actions of the two agents, which are in direct opposition to the this could happen to you element that makes the film so frightening). The film also takes a credibility leap when the characters start calmly discussing finding the patterns and getting skipped (would anyone in this situation really be able to understand and articulate the phenomenon they are experiencing?). But there's also lot to be said for making a good old-fashioned thriller, and since we know that's what we're in store for here, it's relatively easy to allow our analytical minds take a siesta and simply enjoy how well this entire concept is brought to, ahem, life.Simple. There's that word again. We keep coming back to it because the notion of simplicity is key to the film's successful delivery. If the main point of the story is that Death is coming, that's pretty simple, and still effective. However, the interlace of actions and reactions that construct each kill, and indeed the entire notion of Death searching for those who escaped it, is anything but simple.

He was simply given the ideal part for his age, temperament, and long-term screen persona.Glenn Cambell takes the unlikely role of a competitive bounty-hunter on the same trail of 'Lucky Ned Pepper' played with complete plausibility by Robert Duvall. There are many other great character roles and each is played with an almost tongue-in-cheek humour that is very engaging. Because this is practically a comedy-western albeit of a sophisticated nature. Revellations are interesting. We are intrigued by opinions of Marshall Rooster Cogburn long before we see him, as the young girl Maddy courts the opinions of others. He's the meanest, not many people have benefited from meeting him, He likes to pull a cork, and so on. Maddy also has an almost-mythical unseen familiar in the form a 'Lawyer Daggett', with whom she threatens transgressors 'almost like drawing a gun'. Towards the end we finally meet this individual in the paradoxically unthreatening form of a short, mildly-spoken man. This movie contains all of the old 'traditional' western elements; a resolute lawman, a gang of baddies, a grudge, a chase, and a shoot-out. But each character is explored with sufficient depth as to make them both entirely believable as well as individuals we can care for. And nothing is more important in a story. We have the girl who is seeking justice for her betrayed and murdered father. There is the young Texan hoping to gain money and status. The Marshall is just doing his job with ruthless efficiency; he has neither friend nor family, but an ex-wife and estranged son. It's a sad story told with pathos and candour. He was, it seems, also himself once an outlaw now a poacher turned game-keeper. We even get to spend time with the fugitives, and hear their side of the story.Filming and location is amongst the best in any western, with America's great outdoors used to splendid and dramatic effect. We are never in doubt that it really is a Big Country.But another stand-out element is the script. At first, it is spoken so naturally by the players that one almost 'takes it for granted'. And yet it contains some of the most ironic and witty dialogue and repartee ever heard in any movie. Line after line trips off the screen with such a natural disclosure as to almost make them a throwaway. And yet they really are good. Sarcasm, caustic criticism, insults and threats, scolding and praise, are conveyed in an interesting period-dialogue that demonstrates a great deal of thought in their creation. Morover, they each suit and reaffirm their speaker's character to a tee.This is a very thoughtful movie, beautifully filmed and edited, extremely well acted and written with the subtlety of a costume drama. There's a thread discussing the 'best lines' and it's only when reading this that one really begins to realise how good the script is. Almost every line is interesting. There are not many movies about which that can be said. It certainly rewards the careful listener, and withstands repeat viewing.

Sarcasm, caustic criticism, insults and threats, scolding and praise, are conveyed in an interesting period-dialogue that demonstrates a great deal of thought in their creation. Morover, they each suit and reaffirm their speaker's character to a tee.This is a very thoughtful movie, beautifully filmed and edited, extremely well acted and written with the subtlety of a costume drama. There's a thread discussing the 'best lines' and it's only when reading this that one really begins to realise how good the script is. Almost every line is interesting. There are not many movies about which that can be said. It certainly rewards the careful listener, and withstands repeat viewing. It's not without flaws, but the good parts are so good as to be more than adequate compensation.Still very highly recommended.

However in the case of The Rescuers Down Under, the sequel is a million times better than the original and also my favorite Disney Animated Film.A young boy named Cody lives in Australia and goes around befriending many different species of animals. This includes the great giant golden eagle named Marahute. However Cody is soon captured by an evil poacher named Mcleach, who is after the golden eagle. It is up to Bernard and Bianca to rescue Cody and the golden eagle.First off I must say that the animation in this film may be the best that I have ever seen in any animated film. ALl of the scenery is amazing and the wildlife in this film all look real. This is one major reason why this film is far better than the first Rescuers film. Here is an example. In The Rescuers, there are two alligators in the film that look quite ridiculous and add comic relief I feel. However in The Rescuers Down Under, the crocodiles in the film look and act how crocodiles act in real life leading this film to be more realistic. I love how the crocodiles look and act in this film because crocodiles are my favorite animal.The fact that this film is set in Australia is awesome because that truly is the most interesting continent out there. All of the animals in this film are around in real life and you get to see a lot of species of different animals. This includes kangaroos, koalas, frilled lizards, goana, crocodiles, and many others. As far as accurate depictions of real areas and the animals that live there, this film is just as good as The Lion King in that regard.The main villain, Mcleach, is an outstanding one. He is an evil poacher who works well mainly because the threat that he possesses seems like it could really happen. Also he has a sense of humor. For the most part a great villain because it is one that could easily really exist and makes Mcleach work all the better.This film does not have any songs in it. I think that helps to make the film more realistic and give it a more serious tone. It may be the only animated Disney film, not including pixar films, that has no songs in it.Bianca and Bernard are both back. However it is all of the other characters that seem to make the film better and not them. As far as leading characters go I guess they are OK, but The Rescuers is considered a disappointment and the fact that this film is so good not because of them shows that they really are not that exciting.I think this film is incredibly under rated. That may be because I am sure that many people associate this film with The Rescuers. However this film stands by itself in my opinion.

There was some suspense but there could have been more and there weren't any real scares except for a couple of them. The movie does leave a lot of questions unanswered except for a few brief explanations from Neill's character about how the drive works and where it could have taken the other crew. I would have given it a higher rating if there was a clearer explanation to what exactly happened. The deaths however were well executed and brutal. The brief glimpses of people being tortured in grotesque ways were graphic and realistic. Neill's character was right when he says, hell is just a word the reality is much much worse.

But truth is, the plot is only half the film's genius. The rest belongs to the master of murder and suspense.Psycho thrives on suspense. Without the constant feeling of paranoia from Hitchcock's careful camera movements or from Bernard Herrmann's vigorous string quartet, many parts of the film would feel long. At this point in his career, Hitchcock was so commanding of his craft that he achieves the desired effect from his audience with nearly every shot, whether it's wanting us to focus on particular items or make specific assumptions about the mystery at hand.Perhaps the most understated element of the film is Joseph Stefano's screenplay. From what I gather about Robert Bloch's novel, Stefano restructured the story to set up a jarring shift in the plot and encase the mystery in an even thicker container for Hitchcock to best utilize his skills. The scripts only major weakness is the scene right after the climax, which is pointless exposition explaining the previous events; something movie watchers don't need today -- though that's arguably because Hitchcock made this movie.For those that love Hitchcock's style, Psycho is an instant classic and perhaps no film of his showcases it better.

Writer\/director Cameron Crowe has proved time and again that he can't write female characters worth a damn, mostly because he treats them the way adolescent boys treat women when they discover them for the first time.This film goes down smoothly enough, but it's too long and Crowe's writing style is too self-consciously cutesy for my taste (Show me the money!
