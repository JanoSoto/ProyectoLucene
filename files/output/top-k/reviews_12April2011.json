I was surprising to me how well done this was, most sequels fail to entertain as much as the original. This one is not as good as the original, but does add way more tension that kept me more on the edge of my seat. It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is being released from the psychiatric hospital he's been locked away in. Lila Loomis (Vera Miles) who was Marion's sister from the first is absolutely appalled that they would release Norman after all that he did. Nevertheless, Norman returns home and finds out that someone has been running the motel while he's been away. It's turned into a seedy place involving drugs, which Norman finds out when looking through one of the rooms. He gets a job at the diner and meets a lovely young girl named Mary (Meg Tilly). He overhears her break up with her boyfriend leaving her with no place to go. Of course, he invites her to spend the night in his house. We quickly find out that Mary isn't who she says she is. We also see a few people murdered by what appears to be a woman. Is Norman up to his old tricks, or might it be someone else all together? I loved Psycho II. I love the mystery element to it. You see a few people murdered, but the whole time you think in the back off your mind it can't be Norman, not again. Despite the clues all pointing to him, you get the sense that it might be someone else. And the suspect list is pretty long. The kills were well done in a way that they weren't overly gory, but brutal enough to get the reaction across to the audience. Norman Bates becomes a character that you feel for in Psycho II. He's been locked away 22 years, and you cannot help but feel for him as the movie goes along.The acting was very good in this as well. Anthony Perkins and Vera Miles reprise their roles and do a terrific job. I like Meg Tilly in this one as well. Their are so many twists and turns in this sequel, it really keeps you guessing and wondering the whole time. The ending is rather shocking but adds to the back story of Norman Bates and his family. Psycho II is a brilliant sequel to the legendary original.

In 1998 the American Film Institute broadcast its list AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies, ranking Vertigo in the 60s. In 2007 they rewrote their list, moving Vertigo to the top 10- specifically #9- making it Hitchcock's highest ranking film on the list. At the Academy Awards it was nominated for art direction and sound but was otherwise ignored. It wasn't even in the running for Best Picture or Best Director. (Hitchcock never won an Oscar for Best Director; his only film to win Best Picture was 1940's Rebecca).The film's direction and music score are masterful, so the look and atmosphere of the film become hypnotic. That much, Vertigo's critics would find hard to dispute. But the story is also deep- in fact, so deep that Hitchcock felt the need to follow up on it with the more fun film North by Northwest (also a classic). Vertigo is about the dangers of obsession as it can affect anyone- the destruction it causes and the way it twists love. Like Rebecca, in a way it's a ghost story without ghosts or even a tale of necrophilia, like Hitchcock himself said, in that Jimmy Stewart's character believes the woman he loves is dead, but he still can't let go of her. He can't forget her. He goes out looking for someone like her. And he forces the image of his beloved on his new love interest, also played by Kim Novak.But the movie is also a tale of deception and betrayal. For Stewart's character, the world is turned upside down when he realizes the girl he loved and his new love interest are the same person. The way this ends is incredible. He lost his woman on the tower twice. That was the only way to end it- a happy ending with Stewart and Novak reconciling wouldn't have fit the overall sinister tone of the story.The movie hooked me from the beginning, because of the atmosphere Hitch created. When Jimmy Stewart is first following Kim Novak around, seemingly nothing is happening but the tension is high, the mystery is compelling. I've never understood the criticism that there's too much of Stewart following Novak in his car; Hitchcock acted in moderation. He acted in moderation again when we didn't see any nudity in an erotic scene where Novak is naked in bed.I've heard other criticism, including that the story is counterintuitive. In real life, Stewart would have recognized his new girlfriend and his dead lover were the same person, even if the hair colour was different. The movie may also lack closure. Foreign audiences got an added ending in which we see Stewart back together with his old friend Midge and news has come that the murderer is about to be arrested and extradited. The so-called Foreign Censorship Ending, which is included in the bonus features of the DVD, was needed for countries that had laws against depicting murderers getting away with the crime. Hitchcock thought the added ending was unneeded, and indeed, it adds nothing to the story because the murderer wasn't emotionally a large part of the film.As for the claim that the storyline is unrealistic, some people try to get around that charge in unusual ways like asserting the vast majority of the film is actually Stewart's dream. In an early scene in the movie, Stewart is seen dangling from a rooftop, making him realize for the first time that he has a fear of heights. The movie never reveals how he survived, perhaps because he didn't survive it at all. He fell to his death, and as he was falling the events of the film are what flashed through his mind. However, the it was all a dream thing is cliché. And too much happened in the movie for Stewart to imagine while he plunged to his death.

It actually is being one crazy and silly movie, that really doesn't feature that much story and the little story that it does feature is incredibly flawed and badly written once you start to analyze it too seriously, which you really just shouldn't do.As a comedy this movie certainly does not fail. It made me laugh and I enjoyed watching the movie throughout. You might think this is being just a one joke movie about a boy living in a bubble but the movie manages to come up with plenty of fun and original stuff. As bad as the script and story are, the comical situations and dialog are all still well written and executed. Seems weird that director Blair Hayes never had a career after this movie, since he seems far more talented than the majority of modern comedy directors these days.It's basically a movie in which often a lot of random crazy stuff is happening. And this is also one of the more bad things about the movie I think. The movie is really hanging together from its coincidences and decides to simply go along with it all, purely in the interest of its comedy but it instead more comes across as some lazy and very simplistic film-making. The movie still works out well for most part but at others it just becomes too silly and even somewhat embarrassing to watch.

It was Leone's last film before his tragically early death at just 60, and although he was working on a big budget World War II film at the time of his demise, in a way that is tragically fitting as no film could have topped this one. Of course, whilst Leone naturally made his name in the sixties with the infamous Spaghetti western, the sheer sprawling grandeur of OUATIA is an unforgettable experience that attacks the senses. From the opening image of Robert DeNiro's opium filled body to the final scene some 229 minutes later, the sensation carries on throughout and hits home more powerfully than any cheroot-chewing Clint or twanging Morricone soundtrack ever did. DeNiro plays 'Noodles', a young man who grew up with his compatriots in Prohibition America, who then returns to his old haunts three decades later to reflect on his life as a hard-bitten gangster. Every scene is pitch perfect, and whilst there are some caps doffed to the likes of The Godfather, Leone doesn't hold back with scenes of rape, murder and brutality that give the film an edge sharper than a month's worth of Eastwood stubble. It's amazing in that Leone was returning to the helm of a movie for the first time in over a decade - there is no let up in the brilliance and certainly no signs of rustiness. And legendary collaborator Morricone is also back in tandem. Morricone delivers one of his most mesmerising scores and it was reported that DeNiro demanded some music be pre-written for scenes and then played back whilst they were being shot just so he could pitch the mood of his character. It's hard to say that this is Morricone's best work because his career is generously decorated with brilliant soundtracks, but it's also the case that 'Deborah's Theme', for example, is even played at funerals these days, such is the power of the music. Even Lennon and McCartney's 'Yesterday' gets an airing.

It was hyped and it delivered - I enjoyed it. For it's time it had a lot of very good special effects. It left us with the immortal Smokin'! and Somebody stop me!Carrey is average as the nerky bank clerk, but as The Mask Carrey is terrific and very funny.Over the years I've grown to regard The Mask as a kids' film - but here's the big problem; The Mask is most definitely not a children's film!!!I sat down and properly watched The Mask for the first time in years and was really quite surprised and disappointed at what I saw; It's very violent. For example; The Mask\/Ipkiss (a good guy????) goes for revenge on the garage workers who humiliate him, and one character is hospitalised with an exhaust pipe clearly stuck up his rectum. He then goes on to rob a bank! There is some pretty ripe language - short of swearing, but only just! Pretty much all of the adults, including The Mask\/Ipkiss, are BAD role-models who do pretty bad things to each other. The comic-like setting is not comic like enough, and children will only see the nastiness, not the irony.So - Despite its billing, The Mask is not a kids film. What does it offer adults then?Well, there's Cameron Diaz, who is very easy on the eye, reminiscent of Jessica Rabbit in Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988). In fact Diaz even strikes very similar poses to Jessica, probably deliberately. She does quite well with a silly character and script, a very good first outing in a big movie for her.But that's about it! There's nothing of substance here for adult viewers. The film is cartoon like on all levels; The story is weak, dialogue silly and infantile. The setting - Edge City might as well be New York, don't know why they called it Edge City. There's lots of pointless stuff like this, which isn't funny. Also not funny is the epi-centre of the film; The CoCo Club - which is guarded by nasty bent thugs and in spite of the glamorous dressy people outside all fighting to get in is not a place to aspire to. Not good for any children watching, not good at all. Worse still - the Hero Ipkiss\/The Mask is desperate to gain entry in order to chase after Diaz. Not somewhere a Hero should be looking to go - not something children looking for a Hero or adult role-model in general should see.There are lots of bad guys, bad guys working for bad guys, working for bad guys - and they all smoke! Even Diaz works for a bad guy - which makes her a bad guy too. The cops are silly and seen to be so. Then there's The Mask who seems to be a good guy but is a bad guy quite a lot of the time. He takes the Mickey out of the bad guys, but then he robs the Bank that his alter ego Ipkiss works in! The Mask packs lots of weapons too and in one scene uses a 'balloon' machine gun to shoot up a knife gang which come after him to try and mug him. Not for children! Sure - The Mask is funny - but he is NOT a classic goodie, not a Hero.There are plenty of scenes with overt violence which are much too strong for children under the age of 11-12. The worst one is the huge shoot up at the Club near the end; there is plenty of blood, plenty of holes in chests. Not good for children, not good at all!So - this film fails to be kids classic, which is really what it should have been. It fails to entertain adults on anything more than a simplistic level.

What this movie managed to do at that time in the 60's was remarkable. There had never been anything like this made up to that point. It's the start of a great sub genre known as the slasher film. The story is of a troubled man named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and a woman on the run named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh). Marion leads an unfulfilled life and one day decides to embezzle $40,000 from her employer. While on the run, she stops off at the infamous Bates Motel to think things over and get some rest. While taking a shower, an unseen assailant who resembles a large woman attacks her with a knife, killing her. We soon are led to believe it's Norman's mother who committed the crime. It's then we see Norman cover it up for her. Many people question the whereabouts of Marion over the next few days including her boyfriend and sister. They, with the help of a private investigator, discover she was at the Bates Motel. But when entering the house up on the hill behind the motel, the discovery they make is much more chilling then could ever be imagined.Psycho is an all time classic by suspense and psychological icon Alfred Hitchcock.

The story is of a troubled man named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and a woman on the run named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh). Marion leads an unfulfilled life and one day decides to embezzle $40,000 from her employer. While on the run, she stops off at the infamous Bates Motel to think things over and get some rest.

It is a great little thriller from the masterful Roman Polanski. It's about Richard and Sondra Walker, a husband and wife on business in France. Everything is going fine until Richard gets out of the shower one morning to find his wife has disappeared completely. He goes on an obsessive quest to find her, and along the way he uncovers all sorts of dark secrets concerning espionage, gangster, and drugs. This is a thrilling film that delivers plentiful amounts of fun and excitement all the way through.Roman Polanski really shows that he knows how to tell a compelling story through Frantic. The story works its magic here in a very sincere and gripping way. The film is pretty slow paced, and it never really speeds up, allowing for more tension and suspense in the scenes where there needs to be a significant amount. The story is set up very well as we get to know Harrison Ford and Betty Buckley's characters and their relationship. During the opening of the film we are given just the right amount of setup, character development, and mystery to keep us wanting more. Then Betty Buckley's character goes missing and the tension builds from there. There's something very intriguing about the dialouge and acting here that makes you want to know more, and keeps you enthralled in the mystery that Harrison Ford is trying so desperately to solve.All the acting in Frantic is excellent and is one of the most entertaining elements of the film. Harrison Ford gives a performance that doesn't engage in itself too seriously, but is just serious enough to be be compelled by. Betty Buckley is also great, and doesn't fall into any kind of damsel in distress stereotype. Her and Ford have a lot of fun chemistry on screen and when she goes missing we get a sense that Harrison Ford truly wants to find her. Then there is also Emmanuelle Seigner in her first role. Her character has an aura of mystery surrounding it, and Seigner does a great job pulling it off. She has some great moments and her thick French accent makes her all the more fantastic to watch. There are numerous other roles that appear throughout the film, and I don't feel like there was one actor in the film that really hindered its success as a consistently great thriller.Frantic is really just a great movie. There isn't a whole lot to it in the grand scheme of things, and it might be somewhat forgettable alongside other Polanski films, but not judging it based off of those things, it is great. It is hard to tell a truly engaging mystery story, but Frantic pulls it off, leaving me constantly wanting to know more. It is simply just great filmmaking.

I personally didn't hate them, though I do not care really for either A Troll in Central Park or Rock a Doodle(Pebble and the Penguin for me was the least bad of the movies that are considered so). For me, Anastasia and his swansong Titan AE redeemed his reputation, Bartok the Magnificent was decent if not great.About this movie, for any fans of sci-fi and animation, Titan AE is very ideal as it is a spectacular film and fuses these two genres effortlessly together. I do have a problem with the way the movie was advertised though, and perhaps that contributed to the lack of box office success. I will start with the film's best assets. The obvious plus is the animation, which while different stylistically abandoning the hand drawn style and having a more computer-animated approach, is just superb. The colours look absolutely stunning, the characters are very well modelled, the effects are amazing and the backgrounds are incredibly imaginative.The soundtrack also impresses. The score does wonderfully in enhancing the mood, this score is not as dark or poignant as Secret of NIMH for example, but it is memorable and compliments the action and the like very well. There are some song choices too, all of which are great to listen to and don't interrupt the flow too much. The characters are engaging and have a genuine chemistry between them. They all benefit from some fine voice casting, with Matt Damon and Drew Barrymore doing outstanding jobs with their titular characters and Bill Pullman, Nathan Lane and John Leguizamo are also rock solid.The script and story aren't quite as good, but they do engage and don't harm the film too much. The script is smooth and manages to be quite clever. The story benefits from a great if simple concept and is very well-paced(not too fast, not too slow), and while there is the odd hole and cliché hence what I said about it not being the film's strongest component, it does draw you in.

It's a little shocking actually, until you look at the film's overall all rating here - which is a lot more accurate than these silly love letters to mediocrity.

Due to some letters I wrote to someone over in the UK in which I described this to possibly create a wormhole if you use two of them, at the time of this movie, I was trying to visualized what would happen with three such toroids, could we create a black hole with this, or a more stable wormhole opening. At least they got the time and gravity\/mass relationship right as the time dimension is strangely opposed to mass or gravity force field particular warp and bend of the fabric. The eighteen hours of recorded static, recorded in an instant of time at the center of that huge thing in the movie, the dimensional relationship is exactly like that. I was trying to study quantum mechanics, maybe the script writers and Ms. Foster somehow got telempathically linked to my imaginations 3 dimensional mental CAD display parts in my mind or something. I succeeded then in linking with a Ms. Small in the UK in our experiment along those lines. I also speculated that because the notion that black holes are being created all the time, they might pull themselves towards the nearest largest center of mass, the center of our galaxy, which someone proved with adaptive optics. I then concept ed the possibility of using two of those toroids aligned to be able to create a very short finite in length wormhole around a space craft, synchronized with a nano ring molecule accelerated in movement or RPM to the same velocity as the ions in the larger ones in order to maintain the spatial reference framework of the very localized spatial reality of the space craft as it enters the one dimensional conduit of the wormhole it is generating. I discovered and believe this is the only possible faster than light travel system we could use without violating the laws of physics since it utilizes mass dilation in specific manners and ways. I also had to think of ways to power this equipment too. So I am ready to try building a true star ship but it will require careful research's, some in space in orbit or away from the earth. It was discovered that there is a massive black hole at the center of our galaxy and I know that the images that were recorded of a star whipping in a few seconds in orbit around a very heavy unseen thing happened more than sixty thousand years ago and that black hole could have been fed in that time and there could be a huge amount of very deadly radiation that might be coming to intersect our solar systems orbit around the galactic center. If it is, it would literally sterilize the planet and building space craft to take everyone away from the planet until it passes, or digging and starting to live in underground cities might work to protect people from it too, we could take along chromosomes for all other animal and plant life forms from our world, but not living ones except human beings. Think of a large ring world orbiting at geostationary orbit, say some 300 to 500 miles wide flat ribbon huge construction with fusion motors to spin it up for a one gravity inertial centripetal force onto the inner side of the ring, 100 mile tall transparent walls at the sides pointing inward to hold in air and you got a life boat for earth life. What you would make it out of I haven't a clue, except maybe herding asteroids here and smelting them to use as construction material, oh well. It would be nice to license my concepts and ideas for finishing development and manufacturing. That is a topic for another discussion however, all in all a very excellent film, the actors did their jobs, I hated Mr. Woods in the film. I think the NAZI reference was to the human condition of perhaps the dangers of nationalism with regards to the concepts for faster than light machinery I have concept ed and am working on hull designs right now, all just to keep my mind busy trying to figure out safer ways to get into orbit than using dangerous rockets.

The main characters are so real, down-to-earth people with their fears and feats, that you can never doubt they are so real. The parts played by great Thomas Berrenger, Martin Sheen, C.

Or, the final hopeless attack of the Confederate Army in an open field, towards the volleys and canisters - this is heartbreaking.
