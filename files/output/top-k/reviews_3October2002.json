[{"date":"3 October 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Rushmore is the film that let the world know that Wes Anderson was an important new filmmaker. It simultaneously showed his brilliant touch for wit, irony, pathos, and drama all in the same film. Also, it is a testimony to his skill with actors. Jason Schwartzmann (the drummer for Phantom Planet) gives a startlingly good performance as Max Fischer, a Benjamin Braddock with a touch of Charles Foster Kane. Bill Murray might give the performance of his career as Herman Bloom, the millionaire steel-magnate alum of Rushmore Academy who befriends, then becomes the enemy of Max by falling in love with the beautiful Ms. Cross (Olivia Williams). Truly a great film, Rushmore is a movie that touches the heart and the mind. A masterpiece.
