[{"date":"22 January 2007","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Explosions rock New York City as Arab extremists desire for a certain holy man named Ali Waziri to be let go. We see early on that a certain military general has that very man hostage in secret from his government which puts him as a threat himself. FBI man Denzel Washington and CIA operative Annette Bening are trying to get to the main terrorist cell before tyrannical Major General Bruce Willis can further damage what this country has stood for.When a federal government building(which holds the very task force Washington is over)is blown to pieces by a van carrying large cargo of explosives, the government declares Martial Law giving Willis the power to round up all Arabs for interrogations and imprisonment. That in itself has a nation of all beliefs in uproar as civilization is challenged at it's very core. Willis proves he'll take extreme methods in gathering terrorist information executing one man after he can not surrender any info(..because he simply doesn't have any). Washington and Bening know that Willis must be stopped and that they will have to sniff out the cell themselves..which won't be easy as military personnel sweep the streets in tanks and have surveillance within vans following Washington everywhere he goes.The key to finding the cells is an Arab named Samir(Sami Bouajila)..but can he really be trusted? Also, as the film develops over time, Bening's shady past regarding the Muslims is finally brought to the forefront. To explain just how bad it was getting, Willis even commandeered Agent Tony Shaloub's son and placed him in the imprisonment camps within a stadium.As often in Edward Zwick's films, it is preachifying and the message that is conveyed is so loud it decks you one across the chops. But, the excellent performances of Washington, Bening, and Shaloub make the material much more powerful. Willis is an uninspired block of wood, but that's how Zwick wants this type of military tyrant presented so we'll know he's a cold bad guy to root against. The film does have that immediacy and tension as our heroes race against time trying to find the terrorists before Willis' antics really get out of hand. I think the film has a greater potency now than it did in 1998 because of 911, but it's hard to believe anyone, much less Washington and Bening, would be able to get away with their heroics with so much military strength within the confines of New York City.
