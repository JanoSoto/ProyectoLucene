[{"date":"9 July 2013","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Pitch Black is a sci-fi adventure with strong horror elements.We initially see a spaceship crashing on a remote planet due to a malfunction. The survivors include the notorious (but wrongly accused) convict Richard B.

The planet appears at first uninhabited but soon the survivors discover human-made installations but no sign of life. Eventually they come to the conclusion that the previous occupants had to abandon the planet for some unexplained reason.Pitch Black is clearly a film that takes certain elements from the 'Alien' trilogy, especially the presence of extraterrestrial specie(s) that attack humans. There is also a considerable drama and tension here between the actors. Richard B. Riddick is a multi-faceted character whose ability to see in darkness and survival skills prepare him better and help him to assess the dangerous situations much sooner than anybody else. The other survivors have to work together with Riddick in order to make it through and escape. The exploration of the planet (at least near the crash site) was also very nicely shown. This film was a big positive surprise for me. It was also a very good introduction of the Richard B. Riddick character that we saw again in the more ambitious but less satisfying 'The Chronicles of Riddick' in 2004.

Attractive blonde Kelly Preston (as Kate Newell) is hired to help make the station turn a profit. At first, Ms. Preston clashes with Mr. Goldblum. Later, they have trouble deciding whether to kiss or quarrel. While driving, the couple has a flat tire and winds up almost hitting an apparently homeless Eddie Murphy (as G.). After fainting, Mr. Murphy is brought to a hospital...Murphy is dismissed from the hospital and moves in with Goldblum. Physically fit, Murphy makes a health drink for his host which may include urine. Goldblum is preoccupied with work. Murphy acts like a happy guru, promoting the power of positive thinking. While obviously non-materialistic, Murphy innocently joins GBSN hosts, helping pitch their products. This winds up helping Goldblum. Murphy's winning personality makes the home shopping network a sales sensation, but at a cost...Murphy receives over the title star-billing, but Goldblum is arguably the leading man. Editing may have resulted in Murphy getting less screen time; it's difficult to tell. More probably, the actors were paid more millions than film realized at the box office. Murphy is acting out of his comfort zone and Goldblum always seems to work best opposite special effects. The overall film fails, but there are effective scenes. For example, Murphy crashing Goldblum's party is fun, with Eric McCormack (as Scott Hawkes) contributing well (throughout). As GBSN co-workers, Jon Cryer and Robert Loggia lend good support...There are several celebrity cameos. Worst may be Betty White advertising an aphrodisiac that make women smell like clams (apparently). Best is Morgan Fairchild promoting a non-surgical face-lift which distorts her visage. Moreover, director Stephen Herek and Murphy should have worked together to improve the latter's participation in the GBSN skits - perhaps adding a little of the spontaneous happenstance Lucille Ball delivered so well. This might have also helped Murphy's chainsaw segment, which seems out-of-character and doesn't pull all the potential comedy from the situation.**** Holy Man (10\/9\/98) Stephen Herek ~ Jeff Goldblum, Eddie Murphy, Kelly Preston, Eric McCormack ","genre":null},{"date":"9 July 2013","score":"","review":" His job security is tenuous because program manager Jeff Goldblum (as Ricky Hayman) has failed to get viewers to tune in and order merchandise from the Miami-based Good Buy Shopping Network (GBSN).
