And, after only a short while, just the mere mention of Shell Beach seriously began to grate on my nerves like you wouldn't believe.Dark City certainly didn't even come anywhere near to living up to its potential or its apparent reputation as being a perfect example of a brilliant Sci-Fi\/Fantasy story dealing intelligently with such subject matter as humans-as-guinea-pigs. This film was just silly, comic-book shenanigans that left the viewer less than satisfied with its inevitable outcome. It was very much like being shipwrecked on the shores of Shell Beach.This story's major downfall was that The Strangers kept the city with no-name in a state of continual darkness. If they had even the least bit of understanding about humans, they would've realized that we essentially need sunlight for our very survival. (The humans in this story seem to have not realized this, as well) Living in perpetual darkness would mean only severe sickness and surely a quick death for the human race. We, literally, cannot continue to live without relying on the sun as our #1 source of energy.Two things that I found really puzzling about The Strangers was that there was only one child amongst the whole lot and that there were absolutely no women, at all. I don't know if this was some sort of an oversight by the screenwriters, or what, but I found it only added even more damaging weight to the overall weakness of Dark City's already seriously floundering story.Of the 4 principal actors who starred in Dark City (Kiefer Sutherland, William Hurt, Rufus Sewell, Jennifer Connelly), I thought that each and every one of their performances to be unacceptably poor and downright mundane.It was the annoying, pig-faced Sutherland, in particular, who was so atrociously despicable as Dr. Schreber that I immediately began to dread every single scene that he happened to appear in. It was he, alone, who brought this movie down a couple of significant notches.Well, about all that I have left to say is - Thank goodness that my brain farts were odorless, otherwise, if they hadn't been, I would have ended up stinking everyone else watching Dark City with me right out of the room.

Hepburn and Cary Grant are an opposite sex version of Laurel and Hardy here, so dumb they're smart, and so over-the-top, you can't get enough of them. Grant is an expert on dinosaurs, and is missing the one important tail bone he needs to complete a 10-year project. That bone will go missing, thanks to George, a spunky pooch (who happens to look like Nick and Nora Charles' dog Asta) who grabs it then gets distracted by playing with a lovable leopard named Baby. If George and Baby weren't enough to drive Grant to wish he was extinct like the dinosaurs, then Hepburn might, yet there is something about this dizzy heiress that makes him remember that he's a man, not a bone chaser.O.K., I admit that I would be greatly annoyed to be stalked by a character as wacko and interfering as Hepburn, but watching Grant deal with her is a delightfully witty voyage. From the moment she steals his golf ball, dents his car, then tears his tuxedo jacket, you know she's attached to him like glue to a Popsicle stick. And when he accidentally retaliates and rips her dress, that sticky situation leads to even more. They are not quite the only insane ones here. Everybody has some neurotic disorder about them, even the psychiatrist (Fritz Feld) whom Hepburn and Grant encounter in a fancy restaurant and later in the country where Baby has taken up temporary residence on Feld's roof. May Robson is perplexed from the moment she sees Grant wearing a frilly ladies' robe, and Charles Ruggles adds more befuddlement into the mix when he shows up. A dipsomaniac caretaker (Barry Fitzgerald), frustrated sheriff (Walter Catlett) and Grant's jilted fiancée (Tala Birell) are others involved in this mix, which also includes a second leopard whom even Baby might run from if they were to encounter each other in the dark. Director Howard Hawks mixes everything together seamlessly, resulting in a film of sheer perfection.Why this flopped in its initial release has never really been identified, except perhaps that Hepburn's involvement in a comedy after so many serious dramas seemed like something to skip as a misguided shot in the dark. She really proves her meddle in comedy when she pretends to be a gangster's moll, utilizing an accent that is downright hysterical. But the movie audiences in 1938 would have to wait for its rediscovery later on, and like so many other films, this one has risen above its initial failure to become one of the all-time classics, a pleasure from start to finish.

This is not my favorite Star Trek movie, in fact not even in my top 5, but there is something majestic about this movie. When I was younger I hated this movie, and claimed that the movie series started with the second movie as far as I am concerned. This movie moved at such a slow pace that I always would get bored with it and quit watching it. But, being that I love Star Trek more so than any other movie franchise, I would force myself to go back and still attempt to watch Star Trek The Motion Picture again and again. Then finally one night at around 2am I finished it for the first time. And once I was finally able to finish it, I absolutely loved it. And I have watched it from start to finish several times since then.The starship Enterprise has been rebuilt (refitted) and is a completely new starship from the ground up. There is long scene of nothing but footage of the Enterprise sitting in Space dock while Jerry Goldsmith's masterful Star Trek Theme song plays. I know that sound silly, but it isn't, for some reason you n ever get bored at that scene. The Enterprise is such a beautiful starship, that it looks so amazing that you never get bored of watch it sit in space dock while that majestic music is playing. SPOILER ALERTS;;;;;;;;; The movie about a monster cloud moving through space and destroying everything in it's path, and it's headed strait for Earth. Admiral Kirk is assigned to take over the Enterprise from Captain Decker and intercept whatever it is that's inside the cloud, a very simple and strait forward plot. (Written by Sci-Fi novelist Alan Dean Foster &#x96; the only screen play he ever wrote). But things get a little more complicated when they arrive at the cloud and discover that it is far more powerful than anything they ever encountered before. It probes them and eventually abducts one of the crew. Only to send a mechanism back to the Enterprise in the image of that abducted crew member. Spock figures out that the vessel at the hart of the cloud is a giant living machine named Veeger. They eventually discover Veeger is really an old NASA Voyager 6 satellite that has traveled the entire galaxy and amassed so much knowledge that it achieved artificial intelligence and became alive.Yes this movie moves at a very slow pace, it's not an action packed thrill ride. But its still a great movie. But I'd take this any day over J.J. Abrams' 2009 Star Trek movie.I'm lucky enough to own a VHS Copy of the 1983 Special Longer Version that has everyone one of the deleted scenes re-edited back into the movie, something that the newer Blu-Ray Director's Cut doesn't have.

Some other reviewers said that this movie is full of messages, so don't think that I didn't like it because it was more than laughs. I love movies with humor and I love movies that make you think (like Harold and Kumar) but this movie failed miserably in both fronts. Humor I kind of smile at 2 scenes in the whole movie. Deeper meanings there are not 'deeper' if they are shoved in your face for 2 hoursFinal advice If you already have the DVD in front of you, and I still haven't convince you, watch the first 10-15 minutes and when you see my point put the DVD out and do something else with your time. Don't do my mistake and think it will get better.You have been warned!

It might not scare but it can give some good laughs, and even some small thrills. The actors charisma, specially the young female actresses and the simplicity of its story make of this film something purely enjoyable. The villain of this story is the telephone used by two teenage girls who, out of their relative boredom and enjoying the fact that her parents are not at home, use it to make pranks on many people, at first with some childish jokes or inventing stories, to later evolve into saying the terrifying phrase I saw what you did and I know who you are. In one of those calls they perfectly hit someone who has reasons to hide his actions a psychotic (John Ireland) who just happened to kill his wife. Of course the girls don't know that but their curiosity impels them to find the mysterious voice on the other side of the line. Terror awaits around the corner! Such a innocent and almost harmless movie that even a kid could watch this with no problem (except, maybe, for the obvious reference of Psycho with a similar murder in the shower). What concerns William Castle isn't much in creating a frightening horror film but it's more about showing the dangers behind child pranks, warning them about the risks they take when they use a telephone. If made today internet would be the villain and the prank wouldn't be so silly. Why you should watch this? Well, it's fun, completely uncompromising, the kids Andi Garrett, Sarah Lane and Sharyl Locke are quite adorable, and they know to make you interested in the story, responding for the several well humored moments of the movie, and also the great presence of Joan Crawford as the psycho's lover. It has its flaws - the barking dog, for example, in the climatic scenes - but it's certainly entertaining. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 May 2013","score":"","review":" With minor flaws and plenty of innocence, the suspense I Saw What You Did goes with a simple premise that even today can make you completely hooked in it.

I had some really good expectations from this movie, as I had read about it on IMDb and other movie sites, and I had thought it would be a courtroom thriller filled with suspense.But I have to say I was a bit disappointed with what I saw. The film is about a hotshot Florida lawyer Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) who has never lost a case in his entire career. A New York law firm enlists his help to select a jury for a case and recognizing his talent, offers him a job. Lomax accepts and becomes quite close to his boss, John Milton (Al Pacino) during the course of his work. But he gradually begins to uncover some strange facets of Milton's personality and finally realizes that he is none other than Satan himself.Now, such a premise should surely set the stage for a riveting thriller filled with suspense and mystery. But sadly, it doesn't. I think the main reason is Keanu Reeves' performance. I couldn't really buy the idea of him being an argumentative lawyer who could acquit a rapist in spite of the pile of evidence staring him in the face, especially as this is what is shown in the first scene of the film. If the scene is supposed to convince the viewer of the talent of this young lawyer, it doesn't really pass the test. The only thing it does is invariably draw comparisons to the courtroom scenes in A Few good Men, which had fabulous dialogues, coupled with one of Tom Cruise's finest performances ever. So it is asking a lot to make the audience believe that Lomax hasn't yet lost a case.Apart from this, the film does have a few things going for it. The pace is fast and well set, and for a first time viewing, there is no scene which makes you feel bored, irksome or irritable. And, of course, there's Al Pacino. His thunderous voice and arrogant demeanour are enough to make the viewer feel uncomfortable about him, and it isn't really hard to associate his character with that of the Devil. The other characters merely serve as pretexts for Lomax's wife to lose control over herself and imagine things related to hell, Satan and all that stuff. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this as a must-see, but probably something you might just rent at a DVD store when your other choices aren't that appealing.

They're just so good to watch and have the right mix of good dialogues and an appealing storyline to get the viewer hooked. Scarface and The Untouchables would serve as worthy examples to this fact, and now that I've watched it, I guess Carlito's Way does too. The film is an adaptation of Edwin Torres' novel After Hours which follows the story of ex-con\/gangster\/drug peddler Carlito Brigante (played by Al Pacino), who tries to shun away from a life of crime after being released from prison. Brigante had in actuality been serving a thirty-to-life sentence, which had gotten reduced to five years, owing to the influence his lawyer, David Kleinfeld (Sean Penn) had with the jury. Once out on the streets, Carlito pledges to live life the right way and reluctantly agrees to co-own a nightclub so that he can save just enough money to leave New York and start a car rental business. But inevitably, he's lured into crime once again, and how he fights the odds forms the rest of the plot.One thing that struck me as I watched the film was that everything was very direct. There is not really much for the audience to interpret. Each character is sketched out quite well at the beginning itself, and one kind of knows what he\/she would tend to do under the given circumstances. For example, Sean Penn's character, David Kleinfeld is exposed as a corrupt lawyer, and subsequent events throughout the film show him as one, with all his shady dealings and money laundering activities coming back to haunt him. I liked this about the movie, because one is not left wondering what a particular scene means, or what that character was trying to say. Its all said and done. There. Take it or leave it. Of course, this kind of storytelling will not work in all situations, but here, it feels just right. Then there's that aura of the gangster about Carlito. In the beginning, he accompanies his cousin to a drug dealer's hangout for a transaction. As the scene develops, one can feel Carlito sensing that there's something amiss about the place. The tension is brilliantly captured by De Palma here and you can just feel Pacino getting into the skin of the gangster he's portraying. He knows exactly what's going to happen, he's prepared for it, and when it does happen, he knows what to do. This gut instinct comes to the fore in the latter half of the film as well and is part of the reason why this films works for me.There are a lot of scenes and characters which contribute to making the film what it is, such as John Leguizamo as Benny Blanco the young upstart who tries to get chummy with Carlito but fails, Gail, Carlito's former lover, with whom he rekindles his relationship and Luiz Guzman as Pachanga, Carlito's right hand man. But to me, this one is Pacino all the way. He carries the film on his shoulders and commands respect in almost every frame. You can see that he's always in control and this again points to the direct nature of the storyline. The De Palma-Pacino-gangster plot combine gives rise to obvious comparisons with Scarface. But the two are so different. While Tony Montana is just a drug dealer, Carlito Brigante is much more than that. He's a larger than life personality with a heart, remorse, and a conscience. He believes he has a shot at redemption. Montana has none of this. He's arrogant, ruthless and has absolutely no feelings of guilt or regret. The differing nature of their characters make the two films widely different, thus making a comparison would just be a wasteful exercise. The climax sequence, shot at a railway station does bring back scenes reminiscent of The Untouchables, though the events that unfold in the two films are entirely different.Carlito's Way might have its share of flaws which may not put it in the league of gangster flicks such as Goodfellas or The Godfather movies, but it is still a classic, and a highly underrated one at that. De Palma himself is a hugely underrated director (It is a surprise to me how he hasn't won an Oscar yet), and this film just underlines his capability. This one's a must watch for all fans of mob films, but I think that at its very basic level, it's just a story about a man with a heart.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"11 May 2013","score":"","review":" I just love Brian De Palma films. They're just so good to watch and have the right mix of good dialogues and an appealing storyline to get the viewer hooked. Scarface and The Untouchables would serve as worthy examples to this fact, and now that I've watched it, I guess Carlito's Way does too. The film is an adaptation of Edwin Torres' novel After Hours which follows the story of ex-con\/gangster\/drug peddler Carlito Brigante (played by Al Pacino), who tries to shun away from a life of crime after being released from prison. Brigante had in actuality been serving a thirty-to-life sentence, which had gotten reduced to five years, owing to the influence his lawyer, David Kleinfeld (Sean Penn) had with the jury. Once out on the streets, Carlito pledges to live life the right way and reluctantly agrees to co-own a nightclub so that he can save just enough money to leave New York and start a car rental business. But inevitably, he's lured into crime once again, and how he fights the odds forms the rest of the plot.One thing that struck me as I watched the film was that everything was very direct. There is not really much for the audience to interpret. Each character is sketched out quite well at the beginning itself, and one kind of knows what he\/she would tend to do under the given circumstances. For example, Sean Penn's character, David Kleinfeld is exposed as a corrupt lawyer, and subsequent events throughout the film show him as one, with all his shady dealings and money laundering activities coming back to haunt him. I liked this about the movie, because one is not left wondering what a particular scene means, or what that character was trying to say. Its all said and done. There. Take it or leave it. Of course, this kind of storytelling will not work in all situations, but here, it feels just right. Then there's that aura of the gangster about Carlito. In the beginning, he accompanies his cousin to a drug dealer's hangout for a transaction. As the scene develops, one can feel Carlito sensing that there's something amiss about the place. The tension is brilliantly captured by De Palma here and you can just feel Pacino getting into the skin of the gangster he's portraying. He knows exactly what's going to happen, he's prepared for it, and when it does happen, he knows what to do. This gut instinct comes to the fore in the latter half of the film as well and is part of the reason why this films works for me.There are a lot of scenes and characters which contribute to making the film what it is, such as John Leguizamo as Benny Blanco the young upstart who tries to get chummy with Carlito but fails, Gail, Carlito's former lover, with whom he rekindles his relationship and Luiz Guzman as Pachanga, Carlito's right hand man. But to me, this one is Pacino all the way. He carries the film on his shoulders and commands respect in almost every frame. You can see that he's always in control and this again points to the direct nature of the storyline. The De Palma-Pacino-gangster plot combine gives rise to obvious comparisons with Scarface. But the two are so different. While Tony Montana is just a drug dealer, Carlito Brigante is much more than that. He's a larger than life personality with a heart, remorse, and a conscience. He believes he has a shot at redemption. Montana has none of this. He's arrogant, ruthless and has absolutely no feelings of guilt or regret.

A comedy- road movie about three escaped convicts who go in search of a missing treasure in the rural heartlands of 1937 Mississippi and how they end up becoming one of the state's most loved folk bands. I am told that it is inspired from Homer's epic ballad, The Odyssey and the film recognizes this inspiration in its opening credits. But since I've never read the Odyssey, I cannot comment as to whether the film stays true to it or not. But I can tell you that it is a beautiful comedy, a genre which the Coen brothers have dabbled in lately with movies such as The Ladykillers and Burn after Reading. Unfortunately, their comedies are the only films I could relate to. I never really understood Barton Fink or The Big Lebowski, maybe they have many complex political and social undertones which are not perceptible to a first time viewer.In O Brother.. George Clooney stars as Ulysses Everett McGill, a prisoner in a chain gang, who convinces his fellow inmates Pete Hogwallop (Turturro) and Delmar (Nelson) to come with him in search of a treasure buried somewhere in the heart of Mississippi. This starts off a long road journey where they meet a black guitarist, who claims he has sold his soul to the devil and they embark on a series of comic adventures, which include performing a single at a radio station calling themselves The Soggy Bottom Boys, getting themselves swindled by an insurance salesman, disrupting a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan of which the Governor-Elect is a member, among other incidents. The film takes an extremely light hearted outlook on the depressing lives these people led and how they pulled on without any form of economic security whatsoever. George Clooney's performance as the charming, all-knowing Everett, with a crazy obsession for neatly parted hair is wonderful, and to me invited comparisons to his character in Leatherheads, which is also set around the same time. Everett is the kind of character Clooney could play in his sleep, and I sense that he enjoyed the role immensely. John Turturro as the ever-angry Pete Hogwallop is also a treat to watch, and Tim Blake Nelson as Delmar the Dunce is pleasing. But I guess the real star of the film is its music. A wonderful soundtrack, consisting of several American folk songs of the time aptly complements the storytelling style of the film. Most notable among these are The Man of Constant Sorrow which is sung by the main characters in the film, and Harry McClintock's The Big Rock Candy Mountains which appears at the beginning of the film, and has now become one of my personal favourites. The tune and lyrics fit into the mood of the movie brilliantly and are part of the reason why its such an enjoyable watch. There is an almost constant background score throughout the film, and this gives you an impression of a magical land where everything was perfect and everyone was happy, far from what was actually happening at the time. But somehow the situations don't seem all that unrealistic and you end up loving the characters all the more. You just want to keep singing that song again and again. Until you watch the movie once more.

It kept me entertained and kept me wondering where something was gong to pop up and when something else out of the ordinary would pop up.

I wasn't sure if I'd like the film too much or maybe not at all. I was completely awed. The movie is the extreme mystery. The fact that it ends up as a twist is very powerful.

How they could mess things up this badly says a lot about the other sequels.Basically the plot is that six of the characters we know and love from the first Police Academy movie are now on their first assignment - to stop a gang of hooligans that like to scream every last line of dialogue. While this is happening someone tries to replace Lieutenant Harris as the guy fans of the original love to hate, this time we just hate him as he tries to go for the job of inspector.Now my one big problem with this is that these people go into situations that last the entire movie that are just so... BORING. Do we really care about Tackleberry and his first love(who's just like him)? Are we really supposed to give a crap about any of these new characters who are just there to try and either imitate the first one or just being really boring.Now there are compliments - this movie does amuse me in places - but most of the time it's just smirks here and there. All of these parts I could count with my hands. Also unlike other bad sequels this one is just over 80 minutes long. I won't watch 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 (are there more?) because from what I've heard they get worse and worse, not only that but it seems to me like they just wanted to make a sequel in hopes of just making more money and nothing else. I will only watch the first one again and that's it.
