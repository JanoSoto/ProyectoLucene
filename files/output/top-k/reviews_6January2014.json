He was a foreign actor until Desperado (1995) and The Mask of Zorro (1998) had thrown him into the limelight. It almost seemed like he wouldn't ever produce a film where people wouldn't flock to go see. But as the saying goes, nothing lasts forever. Sadly, from what is now known, this movie is one of his biggest belly flops in his career. There's good reason to understand why.The story is about an Arab named Ahmed (Banderas) that is banished from his homeland to end up joining a group of Norsemen to fight a common enemy. That's it. The simplest of all plots. Loosely based on the epic poem Beowulf, many of the characters' names resemble the poems' counterparts. So for anyone who has read the story, some may have a better time figuring out what story arc will follow which character. It's an interesting parallel but it isn't special. Possibly one of the worst aspects of the film is the main antagonist. Reason being, there isn't a main antagonist.The common enemy is a tribe or clan of what come off as cannibalistic bear people. They have no rhyme, reason or motive to why they do what they do. The only dialog heard by them is yelling and chanting, that's it. There is a point where the warriors maneuver to kill the root of the clan but it is so weakly established that the it feels rushed to begin with. Also, the pacing is slow which makes it difficult for audiences to really feel like this is an adventure film. This is all understandable since this movie went through several reshoots and having a screenplay written by William Wisher Jr. I can't understand why his works for the last half of 90sdecade is mediocre. In 1991 he wrote for James Cameron's Terminator 2 Judgement Day (1991). What happened?There are some good elements though. Antonio Banderas is a big one, although perhaps this is another reason why this movie didn't gather much attention. Antonio Banderas is cast into a film with a bunch of no name actors - is there a possibility of the movie performing well? Slim to none. Anyway, along with Banderas is Vladimir Kulich and Dennis Storhøi who also give the most memorable of performances in this movie. They both have their own charm - Kulich is like the early Chris Hemsworth before Thor (2011) and Storhøi is like a blond Johnny Depp with the same charisma. Those are the only two main characters besides Banderas that stood out to me.Credit should be given to Pat McCorkle for casting these actors though because a lot of Scandinavian actors were picked for these roles. As for action scenes go, when they finally do hit the screen, they are pretty exciting. The carnage and sword fights are always blood pumping which helps make the tense scenes that much more intense. Finally assisting these action scenes is Jerry Goldsmith's score to the film. It is the usual Goldsmith sound but it's still fun. Goldsmith even adds a bit of a middle-eastern theme into the music to cover Mr. Banderas' role. It's an OK watch but the story doesn't carry much water.For action film, the pace is slow and the plot is bone dry. However, the actors do give their characters charm, along with some decent battles and appropriate music.

All in all, and despite some telling episodes, this 2-hours adds up to a rather pointless exercise in wartime experience. Certainly, the first half is undeniable in its powerful expose of Marine Basic Training and the dehumanizing effect. At the same time, contrasting its honest depiction of combat training with the heavily sanitized depictions from such 1950's counterparts as Take the High Ground (1953) or Battle Cry (1955) shows how much truth-telling in the movie industry movie had improved in 30-years. Still and all, the movie halves do not match up well. I see the problem as lying with a script, and its inability to etch its characters strongly enough (excepting the ill-fated Ermey and Pyle) to bridge the gap and pull us into their battlefield predicament. At the same time, we only get a sporadic picture of the one continuing character, Private Joker (Modine). Perhaps, the best Vietnam part is listening to how the head of Stars and Stripes skews journalistic coverage in a propagandistic direction. So, it wasn't just folks at home being misled by their media, but troops in the field by theirs, as well. Anyway, the visuals are hellish in their fiery depiction of the battle for Hue. Then too, it comes as a real surprise that the sniper is a woman, the embodiment, I guess, of what the North meant by their motto People's War. Looks to me, also, that Kubrick and co. had little idea of how to end the 2-hours. So we get a strident male chorus of a children's song, no less, as the platoon stumbles through a twilight world. Whatever else, that imagery does manage to symbolize the war in general.All in all, however, the movie suffers in comparison to such other Vietnam flicks as Platoon (1986) or Apocalypse Now (1979).

Well its not all as bad as it sounds, the film does manage to turn that on its head by the end, just about, close call though.Yep so Arnie is a bad dad who only thinks about his work and misses his whiny kids karate class awards ceremony stuff. So to make it up to his little brat he offers him the choice of anything he wants for Xmas, bad idea. The little darling wants a Turbo-Man action figure which is massively popular with kids. So Arnie must now find this toy which would have been easy if he hadn't forgotten about it and was left with only Xmas Eve to find one. So the hectic day begins as Arnie strives to find a Turbo-Man figure. The plot is simply but pretty effective methinks, right away you know there is gonna be lots of mayhem and madness as parents scramble to get hold of this elusive toy. Even without seeing a trailer you can tell there is potential for some classic Chevy Chase-esque holiday hijinx. The fact its the Austrian oak adds to the fun because you can take advantage of his size by making him Hulk out in amusing places.I like the toy design in this film, they really managed to capture the type of toy and its universe perfectly. A kind of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers scenario with a 'Buzz Lightyear' looking hero. His adversaries were very much a visual blend of the MMPR's bad guys with that Japanese flavour and a hint of Marvel with Turbo-Man's arch-nemesis. The TV show we see in the film is a typical MMPR approach, virtually a parody of it, or homage.Apart from the loony pratfalls and childish visuals the film works because people can relate to it. I'm sure many parents know the horror of Xmas shopping for their kids and trying to get a hold of a particular toy. Hell even if you don't have kids you can relate to the nightmare of Xmas shopping and trying to get a hold of anything specific. So its fun to see Arnie as a regular everyday man trying to achieve something which would seem relatively simple. We can all sit back and watch someone else go through the hell we all know too well, much like travel ('Planes Trains and Automobiles').I think the best scene in the film for me is the warehouse full of seedy Santa's and mischievous little helpers which are led by an unsavoury Santa in the form of Jim Belushi. The whole underground Santa's grotto idea is really good and quite funny when you think about it. Belushi really really fits this role like a glove and the fight that ensues is brilliant, only for seeing Arnie beat up a bunch of Santa's. The whole idea of a bad, grouchy, sleazy, disreputable Santa that is mean or rude to kids is just funny, the fact there is an entire organisation of them churning out duff toys is hilarious.This is definitely one of Arnie's better comedies for me as it has a nice slightly dark side for adults as well as the soft marshmallowy side for kids. Adults have Sinbad vs Arnie, Sinbad threatening to blow up things because he's a disgruntled postal worker, seedy Santa's, a brilliantly slimy Hartman and the whole angry parents trying to kill each other at the shops thing. The kids of course have the actual toys in the film, silly pratfalls, Xmas and a nice mushy happy ending where Arnie proves himself to be a great dad after all.In the end its very enjoyable and Arnie proves he can still do comedy films almost as well as action...after his previous attempt with 'Junior'. The film holds up well today too, the Xmas setting will always work at the right time, effects towards the end are a bit crappy, bit too silly, but in general its quite a good holiday romp. The very final scene with the two happy parents leads to a neat and amusing little twist.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 January 2014","score":"","review":" A film all about buying your child's love? hmmm. Well its not all as bad as it sounds, the film does manage to turn that on its head by the end, just about, close call though.Yep so Arnie is a bad dad who only thinks about his work and misses his whiny kids karate class awards ceremony stuff. So to make it up to his little brat he offers him the choice of anything he wants for Xmas, bad idea. The little darling wants a Turbo-Man action figure which is massively popular with kids. So Arnie must now find this toy which would have been easy if he hadn't forgotten about it and was left with only Xmas Eve to find one. So the hectic day begins as Arnie strives to find a Turbo-Man figure. The plot is simply but pretty effective methinks, right away you know there is gonna be lots of mayhem and madness as parents scramble to get hold of this elusive toy. Even without seeing a trailer you can tell there is potential for some classic Chevy Chase-esque holiday hijinx. The fact its the Austrian oak adds to the fun because you can take advantage of his size by making him Hulk out in amusing places.I like the toy design in this film, they really managed to capture the type of toy and its universe perfectly. A kind of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers scenario with a 'Buzz Lightyear' looking hero. His adversaries were very much a visual blend of the MMPR's bad guys with that Japanese flavour and a hint of Marvel with Turbo-Man's arch-nemesis. The TV show we see in the film is a typical MMPR approach, virtually a parody of it, or homage.Apart from the loony pratfalls and childish visuals the film works because people can relate to it. I'm sure many parents know the horror of Xmas shopping for their kids and trying to get a hold of a particular toy. Hell even if you don't have kids you can relate to the nightmare of Xmas shopping and trying to get a hold of anything specific. So its fun to see Arnie as a regular everyday man trying to achieve something which would seem relatively simple. We can all sit back and watch someone else go through the hell we all know too well, much like travel ('Planes Trains and Automobiles').I think the best scene in the film for me is the warehouse full of seedy Santa's and mischievous little helpers which are led by an unsavoury Santa in the form of Jim Belushi.

The reviews were stunning about the 3D trailer that the critics saw and everyone who adored this flick hunted down the 3D predator. But was it all worth the wait was it what we expected from 3D. Being an old flick and never been shot in 3D a conversion was to be made. But Fox did it in a hurry and didn't work years on the 3D project like done with for example The Wizard Of Oz (1939). They used the Ultimate Hunter Release as base for the conversion. But UHR was already under fire by the critics due the bad Blu Ray conversion. So rumours started within the geeks about the 3D release. To the point, it does work in some ways and sometimes it indeed has a 3D look and sometimes it just didn't work at all. The opening sequence was the real thing with the alien arriving from space. The stars really gave depth into your 3D telee. And that's exactly were FOx went wrong. They worked with in-depth 3D in stead of 3D coming out your telee. Nevertheless, I must say that I enjoyed it because it's a hell of a movie. Some effects might see outdated but the suspense is there and the gore is still intact. I'm happy with my 3D Blu Ray but I can understand that the geeks thinking they would feel the predator are a bit disappointed.Just say that Fox went for the money and didn't spend time on the conversion, and just watch the 2D Blu Ray added within the box, it's just the old release with all the extra's but nothing knew to discover. So it's a fifty-fifty, if you like 3D just pick it up, there are uglier conversions to catch...but for the geeks of predator just leave it as it is.

In the scene, Terry yells You don't understand. I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am, let's face it. It was you, Charley.

Kazan's flow of directing makes you feel like you are in the film, or even so; can make you feel like a character! In one scene, after Terry is beaten up the camera switches to Terry's point of view and actually copies Terry's wobbly moments as he's walking. The directing of the scene's really displays Terry's determination and struggle to get to where he needed to be. Kazan also uses great exuberant sound score that defines the scenes greatly. The plot itself is terrific and really makes a huge portion of the film so great. The intricate twist and turns make the film exciting but the dialogue and the actions of the characters control the film to where it has just the right amount of everything.

The main individual behind most of the project is actor\/producer Kirk Douglas (Douglas was also the man who was responsible for hiring Kubrick a week after the filming had begun). Still of the sequences, the themes and the characters have the feeling and symbolism that Kubrick possessed in the four decades he had as a director.Based on a historical novel by Howard Fast, which was based on actual events, Spartacus tells the tale of a slave as he trains to become a gladiator who then emerges as a leader of an epical slave uprising in the Roman Republic. Spartacus (Douglas) is a brave and loyal individual who has strong admiration towards his people much like Christ, only the setting of this movie was before Christ was born. Sure not all the historical context is accurate, but the performances by the star studded cast will simply amaze you, and the epic historical period piece is reminiscent to the classic around the year it was filmed. But what might come as quite a shock was that the levels of violence are very graphic and quite brutal (especially for a 1960 film). It is also saturated with political and sexually explicit content added to the script by writer Dalton Trumbo (who was blacklisted by commie hunter Joseph McCarthy). The visual eye-candy is a treat for the eyes and has lot of Kubrick symbolism including the vibrant cinematography, the clever camera angles and the nuanced themes of alienation and the evils of dehumanization.Kirk Douglas looks like he was carved out of stone gives a very powerful performance as Spartacus; however he may come across as bit over-the-top. But that's just my point of view. I last time only saw this movie was years ago, when I was a rowdy adolescent who's hobbies were cookies, comics and cartoons. But he's not alone in this as he's backed up by a plethora of powerful thespians like Laurence Olivier, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov and Jean Simmons who also share the spotlight and succeeds nicely here.In the end I thought it was an amazing film, not the greeted film of all time, but nowhere close to being the worst film I've ever seen. To call it a minor Kubrick film is no exaggeration to say the least. The main flaw is that some scenes tend to drag on for too long and I think there are times when Spartacus tries too hard to be an epical war period piece (which it does no question about it), but it crams too many sequences in that some scenes were not all needed. But it's still intriguing, technically sublime and the fight scenes were very well choreographed. If you like historical war period pieces that will keep you enthralled, you'll likely enjoy Spartacus.

It seems the older this film gets, the better it gets, on every conceivable level. May I start by saying that this movie could NOT have been made today. The sheer budgetary concerns, combined with the fact that no studio wants a picture this long, this deliberately slowly-paced, and one that cannot be made into a video game or sequels for prepubescent teenagers. Every great film requires greatness on every level, and this one fulfills that contract in spades - the locations, the actors, the script, the direction, the story itself - all larger than life. But particular attention should be paid to the casting, first-rate from top to bottom. No studio today would have taken a chance on using a relatively green actor as O'Toole in such a role! His choice was truly inspired. And the supporting cast, well, let's just say that it utilized the very best talent alive at the time, perhaps ever. Particularly a star turn by a superb and restrained Alec Guinness as Faisal, another great performance by the always powerful Anthony Quinn, even an underrated job by Arthur Kennedy, who's strong and believable all-American characters seem to capture the spirit of Americans like none other (he's seldom given the credit he deserves). Claude Raines was wonderful as the stoic, tongue-in-cheek politician, and in the twilight of his career, a fitting monument to his accomplishments. And can we forget the short but powerful scene by Mel Ferrer as the Turkish commandant? He's the reason they say, It's not the size of the part, but the talent of the actor. At first, he turned down the 15-minute part, but we are all the better for it that he agreed.

Renting the DVD gave me a chance to view 'Oliver!' in its entirety and jot down some notes about it for my university assignment on the portrayal of London in film (see also my 'Mary Poppins' and 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks' reviews).The music is what makes this the most appealing and interesting live-action adaptation of the three I've heard of (this one, obviously, the black and white 1948 version that I watched a bit of with my mother and found boring and the 2005 version in colour that, according to its trailer, looks similar to this one but without the songs) and they made the film relatively swift albeit its length of nearly two and a half hours. My top five songs are, in no particular order, 'Food Glorious Food,' 'Oliver!,' 'Consider Yourself,' 'You've Got To Pick A Pocket Or Two' and 'I'd Do Anything,' all of which are performed during the first act. The songs during the second act may not be the most memorable (probably due to not having watched it when I was younger) but the ones I liked best from that act were 'Who Will Buy?,' Fagin's dark performance of 'Reviewing the Situation,' Nancy's poignant performance of 'As Long As He Needs Me' and the catchy 'Oom Pah Pah.' The choreography is creative, especially during 'Consider Yourself,' 'I'd Do Anything,' 'Who Will Buy?' and 'Oom Pah Pah.' Further to the incidental music, I liked its old-fashioned feel and some parts of it being brief, instrumental arrangements of some of the songs. I also liked the brief arrangement of 'London Bridge' being played in the background during 'Be Back Soon, ' which in some way links to the London Bridge scene later in the film.Whilst watching this film, I could see some similarities to Disney's 'Oliver and Company (released 20 years after this film was)' such as Oliver the boy being taken into Mr Brownlow's care, Nancy and Sikes (?) taking him back and this version of Oliver returning to Mr Brownlow being similar to Oliver the kitten being taken into care by Jenny, Dodger and the rest of the dogs returning him to Fagin and Oliver the kitten being returned to Jenny at the end. In this version, the best characters are Oliver, Mr Bumble, Dodger, Fagin, Sikes, Mr Brownlow and Nancy. The story is filled with dark, funny and moving moments the dark ones consisting of Oliver being trapped in the cellar at the undertaker's, Nancy's murder at London Bridge and the angry mob approaching Sikes; the funny ones including the pickpockets forming a horse and carriage during 'I'd Do Anything' and the brief shot of a Punch and Judy show; and the moving ones including Oliver's performance of 'Where Is Love,' Nancy's performance of 'As Long As He Needs Me' and the ending, which nearly reduced me to tears.Besides the songs I found forgettable, I found the title cards of St Paul's Cathedral shown during the overture, opening titles, intermission, entr' acte and the exit music tedious yet iconic. The cathedral was shown in daylight to represent more easy-going scenes while it was shown in darkness during darker parts of the film. London Bridge was also depicted in a dark way due to Sikes murdering Nancy and threatening Bullseye at that exact location.All in all, this is my absolute favourite live-action version of the Dickens novel and is strangely on par with Disney's 'Oliver and Company.' 9\/10.

The story is filled with dark, funny and moving moments the dark ones consisting of Oliver being trapped in the cellar at the undertaker's, Nancy's murder at London Bridge and the angry mob approaching Sikes; the funny ones including the pickpockets forming a horse and carriage during 'I'd Do Anything' and the brief shot of a Punch and Judy show; and the moving ones including Oliver's performance of 'Where Is Love,' Nancy's performance of 'As Long As He Needs Me' and the ending, which nearly reduced me to tears.Besides the songs I found forgettable, I found the title cards of St Paul's Cathedral shown during the overture, opening titles, intermission, entr' acte and the exit music tedious yet iconic. The cathedral was shown in daylight to represent more easy-going scenes while it was shown in darkness during darker parts of the film. London Bridge was also depicted in a dark way due to Sikes murdering Nancy and threatening Bullseye at that exact location.All in all, this is my absolute favourite live-action version of the Dickens novel and is strangely on par with Disney's 'Oliver and Company.' 9\/10.

Renting the DVD gave me a chance to view 'Oliver!' in its entirety and jot down some notes about it for my university assignment on the portrayal of London in film (see also my 'Mary Poppins' and 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks' reviews).The music is what makes this the most appealing and interesting live-action adaptation of the three I've heard of (this one, obviously, the black and white 1948 version that I watched a bit of with my mother and found boring and the 2005 version in colour that, according to its trailer, looks similar to this one but without the songs) and they made the film relatively swift albeit its length of nearly two and a half hours. My top five songs are, in no particular order, 'Food Glorious Food,' 'Oliver!,' 'Consider Yourself,' 'You've Got To Pick A Pocket Or Two' and 'I'd Do Anything,' all of which are performed during the first act. The songs during the second act may not be the most memorable (probably due to not having watched it when I was younger) but the ones I liked best from that act were 'Who Will Buy?,' Fagin's dark performance of 'Reviewing the Situation,' Nancy's poignant performance of 'As Long As He Needs Me' and the catchy 'Oom Pah Pah.' The choreography is creative, especially during 'Consider Yourself,' 'I'd Do Anything,' 'Who Will Buy?' and 'Oom Pah Pah.' Further to the incidental music, I liked its old-fashioned feel and some parts of it being brief, instrumental arrangements of some of the songs. I also liked the brief arrangement of 'London Bridge' being played in the background during 'Be Back Soon, ' which in some way links to the London Bridge scene later in the film.Whilst watching this film, I could see some similarities to Disney's 'Oliver and Company (released 20 years after this film was)' such as Oliver the boy being taken into Mr Brownlow's care, Nancy and Sikes (?) taking him back and this version of Oliver returning to Mr Brownlow being similar to Oliver the kitten being taken into care by Jenny, Dodger and the rest of the dogs returning him to Fagin and Oliver the kitten being returned to Jenny at the end.
