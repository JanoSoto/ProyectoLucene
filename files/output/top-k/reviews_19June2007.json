The ending too me was Funny I mean sure He didn't win the US.Open but really nobody will be talking bout David Simm's(Johnson) victory they will be talking bout that huge shot Roy(Costner) made instead so to me it was quite satisfying. There are tons of great funny bits especially by Costner and Russo the two just clicked Majorily . The golf action was actually pretty exciting, and I'm not that big a golf fan really myself, but I really enjoyed it and Don Johnson is great as the prick you will hate him, plus Cheech Maran was actually quite funny as the Caddy. One of my favorite moments is when Rene bets Kevin can hit the golf ball into the river and scare off the pigeon and he does it I thought that was so cool!. Overall this is an excellent Golf film that's funny and highly entertaining and I say it's a must see for everyone!. ****1\/2 out of 5The Acting is fantastic!. Kevin Costner is brilliant here he is funny,charming, and showed why he became such a big star I am personally a big fan of Costner's and think he is a great actor, he showed off his great charisma here, some viewers may get frustrated by his actions but I thought they were just great and his chemistry with Russo is amazing!. Rene Russo is awesome here as the love interest, she is obviously nice to look at, but she is also a great actress, she had some very funny scenes with Costner, and cracked me up quite a few times, I feel this is one of her best roles!. Don Johnson is great as David Simms he had some very good scenes with Costner, you will hate him as he plays an excellent cocky prick.

Unfortunately, there's really nothing shocking about 'Happiness'. The most taboo of subjects it covers, pedophilia, has already been dealt with in other films much more artistically and thoughtfully (Consider 'Lolita'). Just because something's disturbing, doesn't mean it's art, and certainly doesn't mean it's intellectual.Even the most enthusiastic proponents of this film recognize that without some sort of interpretation, the film is a catalog of perversion and deliberately disturbing images\/innuendo. But the enthusiasts of 'Happiness' argue that there's something more to the movie, that there is something funny, ironic, 'human' or artful about the movie. These enthusiasts of Happiness are quick to dismiss criticisms of the film as 'close-mindedness' or simply 'not-getting-it'. But, upon a closer examination, it's easy enough to see that the praises heaped upon this movie are done so out of intellectual weakness.'Funny' is always subjective, and one can't really argue something isn't funny to someone else. Making fun of mentally retarded kids is funny to some people, but it's also cruel and shows a lack of compassion for others. In order for 'Happiness' to be see as funny, it's pretty much necessary to disregard any sympathy for the humanity of the characters in the film. Which, in turn, suggests that if you find the movie funny, then you didn't actually 'get' that the characters were people desperate for some sort of Happiness, rather than ridicule or disdain. Conversely, if you find the characters very human and are sympathetic towards them, then you'd be inclined to feel just as much sympathy towards their victims. The main characters in Happiness act without regard for the consequences their actions might have on others. This makes them sociopaths. They seek their own sexual gratifications at the expense of other's well being. In fact, once the object of obsession for one character makes herself available for whatever horrible thing he wants to do to her, he no longer wishes to do so--- because she's consenting. The point here is, by claiming this movie is funny or 'human', you're either laughing with sociopaths or disregarding some people's humanity in favor of the desires of portrayed sociopaths. Either way, it's finding amusement in the rape of a child, and trying to justify it behind 'art'.Some people have claimed Happiness is about irony. This just shows that, quite ironically, they don't understand irony. Whether you use a prescriptivist or descriptivist definition of it, Happiness isn't 'ironic'. The more applicable term would be 'incongruous', often confused with 'ironic'. For example, an optometrist with bad vision is not ironic, it's incongruous. It WOULD be ironic if he went blind from accidentally jabbing out his eyeballs with his eyeglasses. But there's only incongruity in Happiness, at least from what I remember of it, not irony.So, if Happiness isn't ironic, comedic, or something that displays humanity (as in SYMPATHY for people)--- then the only way to defend it against the criticisms of it's detractors is to say 'it's art'. If you want to call anything produced on artistic mediums art, then by all means, Happiness is art. It's certainly a film, with actors, a plot, and even a soundtrack. But just because something is 'art' doesn't mean it's any good. There is bad art. We call things 'good art' when they present something we find aesthetically pleasing, intellectually stimulating, or they capture the essence of a moment with precision. From an aesthetic standpoint, Happiness is mediocre, simple camera panning and centered frames. One can argue that the film captures the essence of the moment, but unless you've been in that moment, then it's not really something you'll ever be sure of, and frankly, I wouldn't want to be in any of the moments in this film. You can argue that art is meant to show us things that we didn't already know, to allow us to feel emotions which we normally don't--- at which point, one is forced to wonder why anyone would desire to experience the awful situations the characters are put into. It's masochism, and a sterile, voyeuristic masochism at that.The last argument I can imagine to justify watching this film is that it's intellectually stimulating. But how? Yes, perverts and pedophiles are people too. That's never been a matter of debate. It is precisely because they ARE people that we condemn their actions and the hurt they cause others. The only question left is 'Should they be punished?'--- and, well...Yes. Rapists certainly deserve punishment regardless of whether they deserve sympathy.Finally, there are some who actually claim that this movie is worthwhile because it doesn't present a moral judgment. But if we didn't already have moral judgments, right or wrong, on sexual perversion, then we wouldn't be able to recognize any of the 'conflict' in the film. The whole movie revolves around individuals who are tortured by the RECOGNITION that what they desire is morally wrong. This is why they hide their longings from 'society'. Without the recognition of their perversions being morally wrong, there's no inner conflict, simply a litany of perversions happening. The problem with 'Happiness' is that the characters, realizing their desires are considered amoral by their society, try to satiate their desires and remain part of a society which condemns their actions, rather than fully embracing their desires by finding a different society, or fully embracing society by refraining from their actions. Their flaws are not sexual deviancy, just stupidity and selfishness, for which we are to feel sympathy? Why would anyone think Happiness was a good movie? I can only conclude that they didn't get it, felt confused and decided it was thus 'deep'. What a self-righteous waste of film.

Therefore this movie has become a cult classic and is definitely worth every penny I spent.The three disc DVD offers a ton of bonus features, and if you're a Smith fan like myself, you will love it all.

Van Damme and Rodman have some decent chemistry together and there's plenty of exciting action scenes, only problem for me was it was a little too formulaic and the main fight wile decent between Van Damme and Rourke considering Rourke had to train for this was a tad disappointing. The training scenes where Van Damme gets back to full strength were indeed excellent, and i liked the fair scene where Van Damme goes after Rourke as that was pretty intense, plus There are some hilarious quotes in the movie from Van Damme and Rodman! You look Like a Carrot with earrings!. It also has a great action scene where Van Damme is fighting to get up the plane as that is pretty exciting stuff as well,however I can see where the critics are disgusted cause there is a baby in danger. Overall fairly entertaining stuff Iv'e always enjoyed it and I recommend it to all action lovers!. *** out of 5The Acting is pretty Decent. Jean Claude Van Damme always is great in the action scenes, it's his acting that sometime's leaves a bad taste,however i'm a big Van Damme fan and here he is pretty solid, doing well in his emotional scenes, having decent chemistry with Rodman, and showing some good comic relief as well, I personally think he did a great job. Dennis Rodman is actually somewhat funny here he never got on my nerves and never really made himself look bad either it's not an Oscar worthy performance but it wasn't terrible either he did alright and had some good lines. Mickey Rourke is great as the main bad guy he was pretty menacing, and looked pretty cool, I was also surprised at the training he did to do those martial art moves he was perfect for this role!. Paul Freeman is OK here but didn't have much to do as Goldsmythe he did his job adequately. Natacha Lindinger is not bad as the wife and did what she had to decently. Xin Xin Xiong is remembered for his role as Club Foot in the Once upon a time in china films he had one great fight with Van Damme!.

Groundhog Day is brought up in my film books and my mom said that it was a very cute movie that I might wanna check out. When I saw the excellent rating on IMDb, I got even more excited. So I figured I would rent it and give it a shot, though I got a little scared when I read what the plot was about, it seemed a little silly, but when I watched this film this morning, it surprisingly worked! Phil is a weatherman who is sent to Pennsylvania to cover the story for groundhog day with a beautiful woman, Rita who he's had a crush on for a long time. But he's always been too cocky and self centered in her opinion. When the groundhog's shadow shows, there are going to be six more weeks of winter and Phil then experiences something strange. He is reliving February 2 over and over again, but he can remember what happened the day before, so he uses it to his advantage at first. But he starts to realize maybe he could do some good in the world before worrying about getting Rita.Groundhog Day is one of those films that is very charming and the story is really cute. I loved Phil's character, how he changed and transformed himself throughout the film. He went from being a conceited jerk to a lovable guy that wins the audience.

Being a late 1980s comedy,I was sure it would be crummy.The movie started out kind of slow for me,I felt it took too long to demonstrate that the bolts of Harry's brain are missing a nut or two. A few of the gags didn't work for me as well but then,thankfully the ball got rolling and so did I! Those having seen this know that Harry's has been hired to fail in the solving of a kidnapped young heiress case,because of his incompetence. Those behind it are the very people who did hire him. I think the first really funny thing Harry said that let me know this would be good after all was,If we can find the crazy typewriter that made this ransom note,we'll have our man! Referring to the pieced together note from magazine letters. Talk about a cuckoo lose in your clockwork!Harry also manages to get his tie caught in a paper shredder,go flying through his employer's office on a runaway exercise bike,goes flying through an air vent system of a hotel dressed as an Arabic air-conditioner repairman.He's assisted by the sister of the heiress,played by then teen Shawnee Smith,who went on to play Linda the receptionist,on Ted Danson's CBS comedy Becker. She likes Harry but knows he really doesn't have a real idea of what he's doing. She doesn't hurt him by saying so,despite how he talks like a man whose watched to many TV detective shows. She doesn't want to see him fail and look more foolish than he does.Annie Potts is great as the mother of the heiress,who could care less if her daughter lives or dies and is a wonderful villainous B. (If you get my meaning. The male players are nit-wits also but only because they foul things up for themselves by both being attracted to Potts. (She looks fantastic in this by the way).In his own befuddled way,Harry comes out victorious in solving the case,rent-borrow or buy he movie and find out how all the little crumbs lead Harry to bread. 8 out of 10,two off for the slow start and jokes that didn't work. Otherwise,Harry was hilarious.

Jon Stewert, Steven Colbert and Conan O'brien do a good job, but comedians just take themselves too seriously. This classic film goes beyond all levels of seriousness and turns out to be one of the funniest films of all time. At first I was only going to give this movie a 9, but I i cannot think of a single reason not to give it a 10. It is so absurd and does everything perfectly. These are some seriously funny people that work so well together. This movie must have been a blast to make and it shows when you watch it. I liked a lot of the little touches that made the movie just a little bit more ridiculous. The one guy using a club to try to club fish at one point is just really well placed and one has to think who thought of putting that there. There are so many quotable lines and memorable moments. Everything from the killer rabbit to the failed Trojan bunny. I really want to see their other movies after watching this.

It was pretty clichéd, but I think this was the film that made clichés before there was any type of movie cliché, so that's not my complaint.

His eyes are captured by a young but fiesty Mary Kate who becomes betrothed to him, but her brother Will won't have of it since he has a bad feeling of Sean's past and presence. Mary Kate grows to love Sean, but loves her brother and wants his blessing with their marriage, but Will is definitely going to give them a hard time before he does that.It has action and romance, not to mention a great and strong cast that worked very well together. I would recommend this film for any classic film lovers, it's one to check out. It just didn't keep my interest, but I would never deny in a million years that it was a good movie.

In that film, the yellow Rolls passes through the hands of four owners, and with each owner comes a story of the life of the owner and his friends during his association with the automobile. It was not as good a film as The Red Violin, by any means, but the parallel is curious.The Red Violin is, indeed, a wonderful film, by any criterion one might apply to a film. My remarks, however, speak to what has been said here about the film -- and to what has not been said.I viewed the film on DVD just a day or two ago. When I sat back to think about it, I realized, above all, that this is a very slyly droll film. The romance and fine sentiments that everyone speaks of are all well and good, but they hardly speak to the artistic heart of this film -- which is humor, irony, satire, and -- well -- fun.Didn't anyone notice the extraordinary lack of sentimentality in this film? The lack of romance? Oh, romance is present -- in the form of a sort of parody of romance, especially in the segment depicting Pope's possession of the instrument. Then there was the wonderful -- and perfectly comic -- performance of Jean-Luc Bideau, culminating with the death of his young prodigy, a death which, if you noticed, was less tragic than it was gently comical and ironic. No one seemed terribly sad when the poor tyke toppled over -- they seemed chiefly bemused.The life of the instrument is then continued by dint of an act of grave-robbery, as it passes into the hands of rogues and gypsies, on its way toward even more extraordinary, and more lunatic, ownership.All the while, we are watching Moritz (Samuel L. Jackson), vetting the instrument for Duval's, chasing down the intimate secret of its varnish, and generally playing the perfectionist, business-like expert. Ah, however -- we discover that what his heart truly is set on is simple larceny (and, incidentally) putting one over on a pompous would-be owner of the violin -- a bumptious bidder who is correct in his charge that Moritz had warned him off the instrument for self-serving reasons. The irony sizzles when the butt of Moritz's trickery buys the fake red violin. Moritz then escapes with the real article to give to his own child -- another irony, because, as much as he knows about the violin, he does not realize that he may be passing on to his offspring, along with the instrument, a virulent curse. A lovely film, an ironic film, a very tongue-in-cheek film, and a very funny film, this is (albeit with some drama and pathos); but it is neither sentimental nor romantic. Quite the contrary. From the beginning -- and others have noted this -- Bussotti is a singularly unsentimental man. We see this in his treatment of Anna and in his treatment of his apprentices. He was clearly distraught at his wife's death; but it immediately became for him another problem to overcome before getting on with his work. I loved this film for its beauty, its wit (a quality that today's movie viewing public should be better schooled in), for its technical acumen (cinematography, sets, and so on), for its clever structure, and for its masterful quality of spoof and satire, blended with a curious innocence in everyone who possesses the instrument, from the unfortunate orphan to the conniving Moritz.

Seeing the MGM logo at the beginning made me wonder what the studio who brought us musicals were thinking. Yes, MGM did release 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY 5 years before SG but this story is so bleak and depressing compared to 2001, which was already pretty bleak in its own way that I really wonder who greenlighted this. Producers were probably trying to find the next big sci-fi vehicle for Charlton Heston, who had a massive hit with PLANET OF THE APES. But as harsh as PLANET OF THE APES was, it doesn't even come close to SG. And even it's obvious producers were looking for a science fiction story with a surprise ending that would top the one in POTA, which they achieved with SG but they sorta went to a certain extreme, certainly for a mainstream film. When you consider that SNL were still making fun of the ending of SOYLENT GREEN back in the 1990s, you know the film made an impact.After looking at the recent DVD, I have to say that the treatment of the groundbreaking story is hopelessly outdated. Who knew the 2022 would look so much like the 1970s. Aside from the obvious anachronisms, there are many other problems with the film if the population is feed only soylent food, why were there so many different sized people? If an entire population lives on the same diet, everyone, and I mean everyone would have the same body type. Edward G. Robinson, god bless his soul, didn't look like someone who lived only off of soylent green. Details like this is were the film falters. It offers a great story but conceptually, it hardly tries to flesh it out. The other big problem is the length. At 97 minutes, SOYLENT GREEN is one of those films when I wish it was actually longer, actually a bit more time spent going over the many layers of socio\/political\/environmental consequences of the story. The film needed an extra 20 minutes to cover all the fascinating concepts it came up with but hardly elaborated upon. Instead , the film spent too much time on the crime storyline, which is pretty weak and the resolution is not even the result of the murder Heston discovers the secret of soylent green not because of the case he was working on but because of Sol going home.But even with all these faults, SOYLENT GREEN is a must see science fiction film. Like I already said, it's a one of kind story considering it came from Hollywood and the story is still relevant today, probably even more so today. I enjoyed watching it even though I wish there was more. More details about the chaotic world. More environmental moments. More scoop moments. More bleakness.

Aside from the obvious anachronisms, there are many other problems with the film if the population is feed only soylent food, why were there so many different sized people? If an entire population lives on the same diet, everyone, and I mean everyone would have the same body type. Edward G. Robinson, god bless his soul, didn't look like someone who lived only off of soylent green. Details like this is were the film falters. It offers a great story but conceptually, it hardly tries to flesh it out. The other big problem is the length. At 97 minutes, SOYLENT GREEN is one of those films when I wish it was actually longer, actually a bit more time spent going over the many layers of socio\/political\/environmental consequences of the story. The film needed an extra 20 minutes to cover all the fascinating concepts it came up with but hardly elaborated upon. Instead , the film spent too much time on the crime storyline, which is pretty weak and the resolution is not even the result of the murder Heston discovers the secret of soylent green not because of the case he was working on but because of Sol going home.But even with all these faults, SOYLENT GREEN is a must see science fiction film. Like I already said, it's a one of kind story considering it came from Hollywood and the story is still relevant today, probably even more so today. I enjoyed watching it even though I wish there was more. More details about the chaotic world. More environmental moments. More scoop moments. More bleakness.

Seeing the MGM logo at the beginning made me wonder what the studio who brought us musicals were thinking. Yes, MGM did release 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY 5 years before SG but this story is so bleak and depressing compared to 2001, which was already pretty bleak in its own way that I really wonder who greenlighted this. Producers were probably trying to find the next big sci-fi vehicle for Charlton Heston, who had a massive hit with PLANET OF THE APES. But as harsh as PLANET OF THE APES was, it doesn't even come close to SG. And even it's obvious producers were looking for a science fiction story with a surprise ending that would top the one in POTA, which they achieved with SG but they sorta went to a certain extreme, certainly for a mainstream film.

I've never disliked her work, as she's a highly competent actress, as well as a physically stunning, highly intelligent, socially polished and engaging lady, but this was the first time I actually saw her stand out in a role, and make a film far better than it would have been without her. On that note, if the producers of the long-awaited Dallas movie can find a better Sue Ellen (or Pam), please let me know who that is. In Judge Dredd, Diane absolutely, positively shines as Judge Hershey, second-year street judge and sidekick to the title character.America has been reorganized in the future due to climate catastrophe, leaving us with a cursed earth wilderness that doubles as an outdoor prison camp requiring no guards, and several megacities where the old justice system has been replaced by a new system that centers around the judges, men and women sworn to uphold the law, by functioning as police, DA, judge, jury, and if need be, executioner. What is fascinating about this film is that the new society is not fascist, and despite the judges holding all of the power, the commitment to human rights and fairness appears to exceed our own in the present day. Power which we would call unconstitutional is not used to suppress the people, but to empower them by maintaining law and order in the best way possible under their circumstance.The plot is pretty standard comic action fare, so I won't delve too deeply here into it, other than to note the strong supporting cast, including Rob Schneider as the action buddy with all its inherent humor, Armand Assante as the line-blurring Rico, and Joan Chen as Ilsa. Still, it is Diane who stands out, and who managed to make Stallone a convincing romantic lead in a way Talia Shire never could. Hershey softens Dredd just enough while respecting his aloofness and inflexibility; she laments his inability to display emotion even as she admires it. Hershey seems to accept, reluctantly, that what causes her to love Dredd is also what makes it impossible for her to be with him. This subplot is explored with just the right touch in the film.The people who NEED to see this film are those who believe that the American way is the only way. Dredd's era and his society have their flaws, but no more or less than could be expected of any society of any generation, living under any system of rules. This is an exceptionally thought-provoking and well-acted film that every serious DVD collector should own.
