The producers of this movie thought that it would be funny because it had some attempted Something About Mary humour in it.  They had parts that tried to offend everyone from Jewish people to Japanese people, deaf and the gay and of course the mentally challenged fat guy.  So the producers of this did the same thing that the producers of A Midnight Summers Dream did.  They started counting the money before the film was ever made.  They thought a film that relies on similarities of a previous film was something that would work regardless of how stupid of an idea it was.  Something About Mary was funny because it was crude, yes, but it was also funny because it had a story and not just jokes stuck in the film for shock value.  Drop Dead Gorgeous is a terrible film and how it ever got past the boardroom is beyond me.  It is occassionally humourous, I'll give it that, but how hard is it to write humour when you are Xeroxing what made another film funny?  But as we all know, when making a copy of something, the copy always comes out worse than the original.  Drop Dead Gorgeous is in a class by itself for terrible movies and terrible photocopies.  Let's start off first by looking at what is such a blatant rip off that it was painful watching it, and that was the mentally challenged fat guy.  This guy might as well have been a brother of Cameron Diaz's from Something About Mary.  But here he was thrown in for effect.  He was thrown in simply for comic relief because they knew they didn't have any humour in the film.  But what made the same character work in Mary was that he was a part of the film, he was a part of who her character was.  He wasn't just a sideshow.  Here he is.  There is absolutely no point for him in this film except for us to laugh at his stupidity.  If he wasn't in the film it wouldn't be any better or any worse.  He is just there to be there.  Nothing more and nothing less.  If you see the film, ask yourself why it was necessary to have him.  There are also silly caricatures of Orientals in this movie.  Again, what was the point?  And to have 90% of the film done documentary style was just annoying.  I of course can see what they were trying to do in the film, and that is to show how pathetic some people can get when it comes to their kids and competing.  It also tries to portray small town America as silly trailer trash that have nothing better to do than drink their lives away so that when one has an accident, a beer can is molded to her hand.  I honestly can't believe how bad this movie is.  It is so bad!What I did like about it ( and this is the only thing ) was Kirsten Dunst. She is way too good to be in a movie like this.  Her energy is contagious and at one point late in the film I almost started enjoying it.  But that was almost.  Even Dunst's energy, charm and sweet smile can't save this awful picture.  This is one of those movies that makes me mad.  Mad that a film like this can be made when there has to be some struggling young person out there that has a brilliant idea and no way of getting in the door.  And then they see garbage like this and it must make their skin crawl.  It's strange, this summer has generally been a good summer for films.  Star Wars, American Pie and Big Daddy have been good entertainment, but then I have also seen three of the worst films I have seen in quite some time, that being Wild Wild West, The Haunting and now this.  What a bummer.  What a waste of ten bucks.  Maybe what Hollywood producers should do is exactly what Apollo Creed did in the first Rocky.

My lover and I just watched this last night in New York City, with a predominantly gay audience, and we found it a delightful, unpretentious little comedy.For starters, this is a romantic comedy, making full use of all the cliches and conventions of the genre (i.e., our lovers meet cute on the subway and endless complications keep them apart).  None of this is new, but when I see people complain about these plot devices I wonder just how many movies these people have ever seen?  All this groundwork was laid down long, long ago in the silent era and certainly in the golden age of screwball comedy in the '30s.  So, the idea today is to see how well a filmmaker uses these conventions, not to wonder why none of this isn't terribly original!  In the case of Trick, these rules of film comedy are applied very well.This film is also, obviously, a comedy of frustration in that our two lovers want each other but can't have each other.  Events and people conspire against them.  Again, none of this is terribly original, but it is well played and diverting.  I especially enjoyed the absence of any stupid heart-felt, sentimental and unmotivated moments that mar so many contemporary Hollywood movies.  For instance, the relationship between Gabriel (Christian Campbell) and his best gal pal (Tori Spelling) was quite realistic.  She was a difficult-to-get-along with old friend, the kind you find hard to move on from. And the relationship (dating, we are told, from high school days) was convincingly complicated.  Yes, she was self-centered, neurotic, even ridiculous.  But, then some women are (as are some men).  This is misogynistic?  What, was she supposed to be some drippy, supportive, self-effacing female saint of a best friend offering her shoulder for Christian to cry on?  I liked her better as played by Tori Spelling.  Incidentally, Spelling has a marvelous scene of hysteria when she goes off in the diner about the cheese fries!The acting in this film was uniformly good, and quite high level for an independent film.  Far from being a numb skull, I thought J.P. Pitoc gave the go-go boy character real depth and sympathy. He was beautifully subtle in the first scene in Gabriel's apartment when you can see his interest in Gabriel come alive beyond a casual sexual attraction.  This deepening flicker of interest easily explains Mark's staying around through a frustrating evening  he sensed there is more to Gabriel and he wants to find out what.  Made perfect sense to me. Also (duh!) if he didn't stick around we would have no plot!The drag queen (Clinton Leupp) has a very funny monologue, also.  His presence in this film was perfectly logical  they are in a gay dance club in Manhattan for gosh sakes!  Drag queens do hang out in such places!  Further, his entrance into the men's room is also well set-up; he sees Gabriel dancing with Mark and follows him into the john to give him some dirt.  Motivation  jealousy!  I cannot understand anyone faulting the screenplay on this note.All-in-all, this is a slight, but very entertaining little film that tugs at the heartstrings a bit.

Anyone who rated this movie higher than a 5 probably did so cause they liked all the nudity.  But let me tell you, this movie was just down right horrible.  And I love Stanley Kubrick films!  Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket are both in my top 20 of favorite films.  This is probably in the bottom 5 and I can't believe I sat through all 2 3\/4 hours of this movie.  As I left the theatre, it turns out I was not the only one who felt extremely disappointment by this movie.  Everyone was complaining about this movie (for those who actually stuck out the entire film, there were several walk outs too).Where did the movie go wrong?  Well, first he cast Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise as the couple.  Let's face it, Nicole and Tom are incredible actors on their own.  (Kidman - To Die For, Portrait of a Lady, Dead Calm and Cruise - Rain Main, Jerry Maguire, A Few Good Men just to name a few).  But the other 2 films that Cruise\/Kidman starred together in (Days of Thunder and Far & Away) they just have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever.  This movie just proved it one more time.  If either of them is to ever win an Oscar, they should stop starring in movies together.  Second, personally I do think that Kidman is the better of the 2 actors and yet she was practically delegated to a supporting role.  She is a strong actress and deserves a much better role than what this movie had to offer her.  Did she have to be drunk during the dance scene?  All this talk of the sex between her and Cruise was nothing compared to her porn-star romp with the Navy officer.  Nicole, you deserve a much better part than what this movie offered.  Tell your husband you love him and go find a movie script and a co-star that will help earn you an Oscar.And Cruise, first, what's this with Doctor's flashing their badges everywhere they go?  He was just not believable as a doctor?  That whole badge thing was like Hey, I'm a doctor here's my badge, now can you do something to help me get this plot out of a rut?Finally, just a few other things that bugged me.  Was it necessary that the prositute have to have HIV?  I realize that safe sex and HIV\/AIDS awareness is an important topic, but it added nothing to this movie.  I was slightly offended at the 13 year-old prostitute, just felt it wasn't necessary and quite disturbing.  And yes, what's the big deal about having to block out the orgy scene?  I mean, we saw the sex, we saw total frontal nudity.  And let's face it, this movie should be NC-17 rated.  No parents in their right mind would let their kids go see this movie.  Then again, no parents in their right mind should go see this movie.This movie is a sad finale for Stanley Kubrick.  He's had a marvoulous film history with some of the most memorable, visual, thought-provoking movies of our time.  It's a shame this had to be his last hurrah.  If you've never seen any of Kubrick's other films, please rent them so you can appreciate the fact that he was a brililant director.Well, that's my say.

Anyone who rated this movie higher than a 5 probably did so cause they liked all the nudity.  But let me tell you, this movie was just down right horrible.  And I love Stanley Kubrick films!  Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket are both in my top 20 of favorite films.  This is probably in the bottom 5 and I can't believe I sat through all 2 3\/4 hours of this movie.  As I left the theatre, it turns out I was not the only one who felt extremely disappointment by this movie.  Everyone was complaining about this movie (for those who actually stuck out the entire film, there were several walk outs too).Where did the movie go wrong?  Well, first he cast Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise as the couple.  Let's face it, Nicole and Tom are incredible actors on their own.  (Kidman - To Die For, Portrait of a Lady, Dead Calm and Cruise - Rain Main, Jerry Maguire, A Few Good Men just to name a few).  But the other 2 films that Cruise\/Kidman starred together in (Days of Thunder and Far & Away) they just have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever.  This movie just proved it one more time.  If either of them is to ever win an Oscar, they should stop starring in movies together.  Second, personally I do think that Kidman is the better of the 2 actors and yet she was practically delegated to a supporting role.  She is a strong actress and deserves a much better role than what this movie had to offer her.  Did she have to be drunk during the dance scene?  All this talk of the sex between her and Cruise was nothing compared to her porn-star romp with the Navy officer.  Nicole, you deserve a much better part than what this movie offered.  Tell your husband you love him and go find a movie script and a co-star that will help earn you an Oscar.And Cruise, first, what's this with Doctor's flashing their badges everywhere they go?  He was just not believable as a doctor?  That whole badge thing was like Hey, I'm a doctor here's my badge, now can you do something to help me get this plot out of a rut?Finally, just a few other things that bugged me.  Was it necessary that the prositute have to have HIV?  I realize that safe sex and HIV\/AIDS awareness is an important topic, but it added nothing to this movie.  I was slightly offended at the 13 year-old prostitute, just felt it wasn't necessary and quite disturbing.  And yes, what's the big deal about having to block out the orgy scene?  I mean, we saw the sex, we saw total frontal nudity.  And let's face it, this movie should be NC-17 rated.  No parents in their right mind would let their kids go see this movie.  Then again, no parents in their right mind should go see this movie.This movie is a sad finale for Stanley Kubrick.  He's had a marvoulous film history with some of the most memorable, visual, thought-provoking movies of our time.  It's a shame this had to be his last hurrah.  If you've never seen any of Kubrick's other films, please rent them so you can appreciate the fact that he was a brililant director.Well, that's my say.
