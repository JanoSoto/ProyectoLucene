[{"date":"28 August 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Released as a super hit American-Australian sci-fi and action film directed by The Wachowski Brothers, The Matrix is super hit for popularizing a visual effect known as digitally enhanced simulation of variable-speed. Matrix is for the people who were waiting to catch up with the graphic potential of comic books. Inspired by various sources like Japanese fights, The Matrix is a new class of movie, a futurist fusion of technology, attitude and stimulating action. It's a quite intense movie especially for the teens. The Wachowski Brothers direct the movie with non-stop style and imbue each scene with enough eye-candy to make you stop noticing the gaping plot holes and lapses in logic. The Matrix is entertaining, but it may puzzle you first time more or less, a second time viewing it is actually required to acquire the complete 'entertainment' worth out of it! It's incredible without flaws. Being intense, this movie is truly inventive and imaginative science fiction entry. All I have to say is Wowww!!

They're pursuing the Empress of China or a load of gold -- whatever -- and have many misadventures.It didn't dawn on me until the end that the title Shanghai Noon is a comical take on High Noon (aduh). Anyway, this is a good flick to watch if you're in the mood for an Indiana Jones-type movie, like 1999's The Mummy. It's not as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark, but it's better than its sequels.Chan and Wilson have great chemistry and the humor is really funny, like the Wyatt Earp line at the end. Of course, with Jackie Chan the action is great as well, but it goes a bit overboard towards the end, which is typical of Hollywood.The film runs 110 minutes and was shot in Alberta, Canada, and the Forbidden City, Beijing.GRADE B+ ","genre":null},{"date":"28 August 2013","score":"","review":" Released in 2000, Shanghai Noon features Jackie Chan as Chon Wang (the Chinese spelling of John Wayne, lol) who teams up with good-bad-guy Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson).
