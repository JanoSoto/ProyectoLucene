I was wrong. It's mindblowing; absolutely magnificent. There is not one aspect of the entire film that I can pick fault with. Frank Darabont is clearly an exemplar of cinematic masterpiece; the Shawshank Redemption was excellent, this is so good there aren't words to describe it. It has everything; drama- the stories in themselves are quite a dramatic backdrop; comedy-the pathos one could cut with a knife, the characters are constructed beautifully, evil is scorned, goodness is reinforced, and yet it doesn't come across as at all preachy. The tinges of sadness, are just that. Incredibly emotional but never corny, the sentimentality is exuded and the resulting catharsis electrifying. Michael Clarke Duncan is just amazing as John Coffey (like the drink, only not spelt the same....). The scenes where the satanic Percy 'forgets' to wet the sponge, and John can feel the executee's pain and he is writhing and jumping in horror so much so that 'Mr Jingles' the mouse leaps from his hands and shoots straight under the door is just awe inspiring. The special effects with the lights exploding, together with Michael Clarke Duncan's acting and the wonderful, apposite score just gels together so incredibly well. The entire ensemble cast were just magnificent. I've always liked Tom Hanks but this has to be his best role. He shows such versatility as an actor. The many different characters he's played in films such as 'Big', 'Philadelphia', 'Forrest Gump'(his second best role), 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'CastAway'- the latter film was not a brilliant one but with any other actor it would have been dire. He has the power to keep the film going by injecting his humour, warmth and damn humanity into the roles, all of them with differences, and lights up the screen. My favourite american film actor of all time, bar none. If you don't own 'The Green Mile' then I suggest that you go and buy it now!!! It's been out a while and it can be bought for less than 8 pounds in most shops now (I guess that's the equivalent of about 13 US Dollars) and for that you get not only a magnificent film of the highest calibre, but a couple of documentaries too.  Well worth it!PS If you haven't read the book, it doesn't matter. I would recommend you do though as it's Stephen King's best in my opinion. Other good (they're all pretty good) Stephen King novels include, 'The Shining', 'It', 'Misery', and 'Carrie'.

I'm able to suspend the disbelief of the aliens having their hairy bodies shaved and appearing human--it's a quite creative idea--but I wasn't able to forgive other goofy plot holes, like the aliens landing on earth with no knowledge of the English vocabulary and imitating the lines they hear from movies and TV shows, and in no time they speak the language fluently.  I love the fish-out-of-water idea of aliens appearing as humans and walking the earth, because it's a premise that can go quite far, as we've seen in the sitcom 3rd Rock from the Sun.  What makes the idea so funny is that the fact that no matter how different they act than the average human being, the people around them simply think they're stupid humans rather than aliens.  And it's a believable paradox, since a minority of people believe that aliens exist and an even smaller minority believe that they walk the earth in the form of humans.

Sometimes the actors seem too embarrassed to finish their sentences, such as when Reggie sees his girlfriend pull up in a car right after narrowly escaping certain doom, and whispers, Okay, everybody, get in the car, Alchemy is here... and the words sort of trail off amidst the action. Or how about when the two main characters are at a graveyard, dressed in black and wearing ridiculously silly Men in Black sunglasses. I'm sorry, Reggie, Mike says in regards to those who have died. Then Reggie puckers up his lips into a grimace and says, Let's go. We've got stuff to do. Watch his face when he says this. He has to keep from laughing.Then there's a classic scene where Reggie escapes from a car explosion triggered by the villain, gets to his feet, stares at Mike and says, Let's kick some ass. I nearly fell on the floor laughing. Yep, it's that bad. It doesn't sound very terrible, but with the direction and music overlapping the infamous actors, it's just about horrendous enough that I will cherish it forever. This is the type of scene I wish I could record and label as One of the Worst Scenes Ever, then tuck away in my video collection whenever I'm in need of a good laugh. This is Mystery Science Theater 3000 material. I came up with an abundance of jokes just watching Phantasm II, and if there's ever a sequel to MST3K, let's hope they pick this to spoof.From beginning to end it's a huge mess and an affront to all viewers.The original Phantasm was released in 1979, filmed on a low budget and starring a kid named A. Michael Baldwin. So with nine years to get ready for a sequel, one would think that the director -- Don Coscarelli -- might try to improve the visual effects, screenplay, story, etc. Nope. This movie has horrendous visuals; when a girl is thrown across a room, we can see the dummy attached to strings on a small miniature. It's something I'd expect a film student to construct, not a mainstream director (and especially not in a sequel).

Meanwhile Chief Garnett has been put on the manhunt, along with a mobile home and an unwanted partner in Sally Gerber.Despite the heavy names in the cast list, this film is something of a strange beast; the basic plot sounds about as formulaic as they come, the running time is overlong and the whole thing is enjoyable without actually ever really coming to life with a spark.  The formulaic plot, you will not be surprised to learn, sees Butch uncover his paternal side with Phillip while Garnett comes to have a bit of respect for his prey rather than his political masters.  So nothing particularly new there then, and so it plods through it's padded running time with a reasonable air of familiarity but not contempt.While Butch and Phillip move across the state in an episodic adventure of meeting people and having little events where they grow closer, Garnett provides a semi-comic relief from the main tale - wisely, I thought, as it breaks up what would be very formulaic otherwise.  The various little events that Butch and Phillip go through are pretty good - some act as action, some amusing and some are used to reveal the fact that Butch can as easily be unhinged as he can be paternal; it moves slower than it really needs to but it rarely gets boring as long as you are going along with it.  This is not to say that it couldn't have been done better - it was too long, it did draw things out at times and the plot is well worn but it still just about works.The cast don't really do a great deal to help the material either; despite the fact that there are some pretty big names here.  Costner plays against type (at the time) pretty well and is able to do enough to win over the audience before then switching it on us.  Lowther is quite good and manages to avoid the cute-kid clichés that usually come with this type of film. Most of the interesting cast though, are in the trailer are and given little time to work.  Eastwood is a good character but he limits his own impact and focuses the film on Butch; likewise Dern, Whitford and so on are left hanging in what is very much a side issue.Overall this is an OK film but it is hard to really get excited by it.

Commentary reflected the high degree of polarization this long, engrossing and deeply disturbing Indie film created.  I saw it when it first briefly hit Manhattan theaters and last night I watched the DVD release, reabsorbed in its intricacies.Emily Watson's portrayal as young Bess McNeill is the most powerful performance of a career still in the ascendancy.  Bess lives in a small Scottish village by the sea, away from any center of culture or heterogeneity.  She has no job and she appears to volunteer her services as a janitor at the church which her family attends. It is the dominating religious, social and - I suspect - political entity in the area.Bess has one friend, a woman who becomes increasingly important both to her and the story, nurse Dodo McNeill, widowed wife of Bess's brother. (Katrin Cartlidge, a truly gifted and beautiful actress, is Dodo.  A tragedy, she died in 2002 of pneumonia barely into her forties.)The movie begins with Bess asking, apparently, for permission to marry an outsider.  She receives, in church, grudging authorization to wed Jan, a worker on an off-shore oil rig (the always interesting Stellan Skarsgard). We're never told how she met him but the church scene immediately and succinctly conveys the fear and, indeed, near loathing the male religious oligarchs have of anyone entering their closed and tightly controlled community.Jan and Bess wed in a ceremony followed by a party where some of Jan's hard drinking work pals attend but hardly mingle with the lemonade-sipping locals (there's a very funny chug-a-lug competition that highlights the dividing lines neatly).Bess is not only a virgin, she's never seen a naked man before.  Her initiation into sex is rather a success and her love for Jan deepens as rapidly as her new found lust for vigorous and frequent love-making.Jan suffers a near fatal accident on the rig and is flown back to hospital. It doesn't take long for the doctors to determine he's permanently paralyzed from the neck down.  Dr. Richardson (Adrian Rawlins) becomes chief physician not only to Jan but to his disconsolate wife who prays for a miraculous recovery while remaining devoted to her husband.What happens next is the plot twist that has fascinated many and repelled quite a few.  Jan, knowing that physical intimacy with Bess is impossible, asks her - no, really implores her - to take on any number of lovers AND report back the details of her trysts.  After a hesitant and almost funny start, she complies.  As her sex life accelerates any humor evaporates.The results of the ongoing experiment in vicarious lovemaking for Jan and for Bess, sinking way beyond her depth, are disastrous.  She slowly elides into a twisted caricature of the personality envisioned by Jan.  Communal rejection is not far off.  And this in a community where membership in the church is the sole indicium of civic and personal legitimacy.Some critics and viewers described Bess as retarded or simple from the beginning.  I found her to be naive and inexperienced, the kind of sheltered person for whom marriage to a man of broad experience and unfettered sexuality is boundlessly liberating.  Bess's inevitable penance does not stem from any interior failing of her's. It's the game urged on by Jan that exposes her to the venomous wrath of religious fundamentalists whose innate need to condemn and consign to hell (literally and volubly) is beyond Jan's imagination.  Whether his desire that she engage in sexual escapades really reflected his belief that it would make him feel better or whether this was an evolving pathological caprice on his part (and both views have strong adherents here on IMDb and elsewhere), he did not foresee the resulting debacle.On several levels von Trier has mirrored, through powerful acting and awesome direction, that small, closed society whose fundamentalist interiority is a microcosm of the hatred that blind, non-humanistic religion often brings (it's easy to see the stern, unsmiling, dogma-obsessed church leader as a modern incarnation of the sixteenth century's John Knox of Edinburgh).Von Trier won't let Bess escape as her situation worsens. Dr. Richardson and Dodo first ask and then beg her to abandon her self-destructive and now publicly shocking behavior.  There is a sense of classical tragedy in the painful unfolding of Bess's mental and physical deterioration.  She can't curtail her conduct because of her absolute devotion to Jan and her community can't and won't understand or forgive her.The resolution is wrenching but also uplifting with the suggestion that Bess's acts reflect good in a pristine sense.  It's not meant to be realistic but to deliver, I felt, a needed moral lesson.Breaking the Waves isn't for everyone. It does showcase brilliant acting and direction in a fable that has some very uncompromising arguments about a religious dominance which only concerns itself with a believed afterlife, caring nothing about addressing the pains of living and administering to its sufferers compassionately.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 March 2004","score":"74 out of 88 people found the following review useful","review":"  Director and writer Lars von Trier's 1996 Breaking the Waves received much attention worldwide when initially released.

Commentary reflected the high degree of polarization this long, engrossing and deeply disturbing Indie film created.  I saw it when it first briefly hit Manhattan theaters and last night I watched the DVD release, reabsorbed in its intricacies.Emily Watson's portrayal as young Bess McNeill is the most powerful performance of a career still in the ascendancy.  Bess lives in a small Scottish village by the sea, away from any center of culture or heterogeneity.  She has no job and she appears to volunteer her services as a janitor at the church which her family attends. It is the dominating religious, social and - I suspect - political entity in the area.Bess has one friend, a woman who becomes increasingly important both to her and the story, nurse Dodo McNeill, widowed wife of Bess's brother. (Katrin Cartlidge, a truly gifted and beautiful actress, is Dodo.  A tragedy, she died in 2002 of pneumonia barely into her forties.)The movie begins with Bess asking, apparently, for permission to marry an outsider.  She receives, in church, grudging authorization to wed Jan, a worker on an off-shore oil rig (the always interesting Stellan Skarsgard). We're never told how she met him but the church scene immediately and succinctly conveys the fear and, indeed, near loathing the male religious oligarchs have of anyone entering their closed and tightly controlled community.Jan and Bess wed in a ceremony followed by a party where some of Jan's hard drinking work pals attend but hardly mingle with the lemonade-sipping locals (there's a very funny chug-a-lug competition that highlights the dividing lines neatly).Bess is not only a virgin, she's never seen a naked man before.  Her initiation into sex is rather a success and her love for Jan deepens as rapidly as her new found lust for vigorous and frequent love-making.Jan suffers a near fatal accident on the rig and is flown back to hospital. It doesn't take long for the doctors to determine he's permanently paralyzed from the neck down.  Dr. Richardson (Adrian Rawlins) becomes chief physician not only to Jan but to his disconsolate wife who prays for a miraculous recovery while remaining devoted to her husband.What happens next is the plot twist that has fascinated many and repelled quite a few.  Jan, knowing that physical intimacy with Bess is impossible, asks her - no, really implores her - to take on any number of lovers AND report back the details of her trysts.  After a hesitant and almost funny start, she complies.  As her sex life accelerates any humor evaporates.The results of the ongoing experiment in vicarious lovemaking for Jan and for Bess, sinking way beyond her depth, are disastrous.  She slowly elides into a twisted caricature of the personality envisioned by Jan.  Communal rejection is not far off.  And this in a community where membership in the church is the sole indicium of civic and personal legitimacy.Some critics and viewers described Bess as retarded or simple from the beginning.  I found her to be naive and inexperienced, the kind of sheltered person for whom marriage to a man of broad experience and unfettered sexuality is boundlessly liberating.  Bess's inevitable penance does not stem from any interior failing of her's. It's the game urged on by Jan that exposes her to the venomous wrath of religious fundamentalists whose innate need to condemn and consign to hell (literally and volubly) is beyond Jan's imagination.  Whether his desire that she engage in sexual escapades really reflected his belief that it would make him feel better or whether this was an evolving pathological caprice on his part (and both views have strong adherents here on IMDb and elsewhere), he did not foresee the resulting debacle.On several levels von Trier has mirrored, through powerful acting and awesome direction, that small, closed society whose fundamentalist interiority is a microcosm of the hatred that blind, non-humanistic religion often brings (it's easy to see the stern, unsmiling, dogma-obsessed church leader as a modern incarnation of the sixteenth century's John Knox of Edinburgh).Von Trier won't let Bess escape as her situation worsens. Dr. Richardson and Dodo first ask and then beg her to abandon her self-destructive and now publicly shocking behavior.  There is a sense of classical tragedy in the painful unfolding of Bess's mental and physical deterioration.  She can't curtail her conduct because of her absolute devotion to Jan and her community can't and won't understand or forgive her.The resolution is wrenching but also uplifting with the suggestion that Bess's acts reflect good in a pristine sense.  It's not meant to be realistic but to deliver, I felt, a needed moral lesson.Breaking the Waves isn't for everyone. It does showcase brilliant acting and direction in a fable that has some very uncompromising arguments about a religious dominance which only concerns itself with a believed afterlife, caring nothing about addressing the pains of living and administering to its sufferers compassionately.10\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"21 March 2004","score":"7 out of 37 people found the following review useful","review":"  Morbidity is all around in this ultra-violent, belated sequel (almost 10 years) to Phantasm.

It has been so long since I saw the original that I can't make a comparison.  But Billy Crystal gave as good a performance as usual, and Jon Lovitz was a worthwhile addition as Crystal's idiotic brother.  Jack Palance gave another Oscar-winning performance as the sailor-turned-restaurant-pirate who hoped his late brother knew a big secret (too bad those who decide Academy Award nominations didn't agree).It took a while to get to the quest for Curly's Gold, but even the early parts of the movie were entertaining.  The search for gold was the best part, with these bumbling idiots, and Duke, getting into all kinds of trouble.  Plenty of action, and beautiful scenery, and lots of physical comedy.  I wasn't all that happy with the ending, but the reality is, can a group of ordinary guys really be happy if they find millions of dollars in gold? I won't say what went wrong in their quest, but they did get to be really, really happy at one point, and that was satisfying.The real gold here was Duke's telling of his life story, and the guys working together despite incredible odds.  This was probably as good as the first movie for those reasons.
