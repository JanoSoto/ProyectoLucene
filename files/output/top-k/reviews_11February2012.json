[{"date":"11 February 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Yesterday I wrote a review of Clint Eastwood's J. Edgar, where I talked about how biopics are instantly met with the mountain of having to condense the life of a historical figure into a two hour film. I posited that they should instead focus on an important part of their life and work it as a character study around that, rather than trying to produce a history lesson of their birth to death. It's a strange coincidence that today I was finally struck with the proper motivation to sit down and watch Shekhar Kapur's Elizabeth, because this is the rare biopic that does exactly that.The film focuses on Queen Elizabeth I of England, but instead of trying to detail her entire life, Michael Hirst's script centers on when Elizabeth first takes the throne and the tribulations that she encountered upon coming into power; tribulations seems far too meager a word though, for what she had to face. Elizabeth was faced with threats from all angles, political, romantic and life-threatening and the film does an excellent job of making you feel as though the walls are closing in on Elizabeth from every side. Slowly everything becomes more intimate and intense, culminating in a rush of drama during the climax where every facet of her life hangs in the balance.Kapur took a gamble by placing the film on the shoulders of the mostly untested Cate Blanchett, who hadn't even done a handful of film roles at the time, and it's one that pays off miraculously. Blanchett gives us one of our first tastes of the mastery of her skill that we would later come to expect practically once a year, and it might just be her finest performance to date. She fully disappears into this role, allowing us to sink in with her to the paranoia and high drama of this woman's world. This is one of those rare gems of a performance that goes through such an extensive evolution, but does it all in a way so natural and effortless that you don't even notice it unless you're paying attention. When you get to the final scene and you look back at the woman who we began the film with, it is absolutely astonishing the transformation that has occurred, and this is all thanks to Blanchett's seamless portrayal. She takes us on this journey from frightened and unsure young lady into a fierce and strong-willed queen.The supporting cast all delivers as well, with a great ensemble including Joseph Fiennes, Richard Attenborough and Christopher Eccleston, but the standout for me was Geoffrey Rush. As Elizabeth's closest protector, he gives a subtle yet incredibly commanding performance that meshes moments of intimidation, seduction and the strangest sense of grace at times. It's a marvelous cast in a film that is quite the treat itself. I'll be curious to see what they do with Golden Age, since this one closes with the standard, ...and these are the things that happened until she died..., texts.

Generally, it's always the rise of the underdogs who live their sport, and manage to come up miraculously and win in the end. It ends with a cloying victory celebration in slow-mo. The surprising ones may not take this conventional approach, though it moves on similar lines. Chariots of Fire takes this unconventional approach of not turning the film into a German vs. Jew film where one is bad and the other is good. It does not take sides, but regards its characters as actual human beings with personal desires and goals and t prejudices. Some may be disappointed with the 'Everyone's happy!' climax as there is always an adrenaline that even gushes among viewers when they watch a spots film; they want to cheer one side and jeer the other. In Chariots of Fire, the director takes a leisurely approach that insists viewers not to take sides but to enjoy the game. We do end up rooting for both the German and the Jew rather than placing our bets on one. This helps to avoid having a theme of 'acceptance between races', as while watching the film, one realizes that the 'racial discrimination' is more in the mind of the Jew rather than the others; the Jew's girlfriend laughs with disbelief at his perception regarding the Germans' bias towards Jews. By not taking sides, it has toned down the controversial matter. And it is generally advisable not to let such matters overshadow the main element of the film, that is 'race', which itself serves as a pun.It is surprising that as I write the review, my perception regarding the film, which I only saw yesterday, widens. I am able to see the analogy between 'race' as a sport, and 'race' as in human race. The ending in the film is all the more satisfying to me now. The film is about the Olympics Event in 1924 which saw the victories of Harold Abraham, a Jewish runner and Eric Liddell, a devout Catholic runner. Both have their stories to tell &#x96; Harold is the son of a wealthy Jewish financier, who never tasted defeat in racing till he met his match in Liddell, a catholic who serves the Church and is constantly solicited by his sister to devote less time to races and more towards missionaries. Liddell, in a memorable line from the film, says 'God made me fast'. Both have reasons to race, but the satisfaction they get from winning is different. It can be seen not only from their running style but also on their faces when they cross the finish line. Abraham reveres Liddell, who runs like the wind and looks blissful when he wins. That creates a silent rivalry between them as both men want to prove. The film manages to be inspiring, although it is not a perfect movie. Because it is British, the temperament among the racers itself is quite phlegmatic; it is like watching sheep running in a field. Indian films like Lagaan and Chak De India are louder and more ebullient while American films very exciting and fast-paced. It may bore many viewers who expected the sound of the gunshot and banging of loud drums and fast-paced racing. But is it not fascinating to observe the expressions on all those racers' faces when the film is in slow-mo? How funny is it to watch Lindsay's tongue sticking out like a dog when he runs? Or Liddell's almost orgasm-like reaction to winning? Or even Abraham's intense face determination? The only complaints I had with the film was that at times, the monologues were too long. Also, Nicholas Farrell's Aubrey did not have much character development, in spite of being introduced in the beginning of the movie itself. Sybil Gordon's character was a distraction here; instead, more screen time could have been given to Aubrey, Abraham and Liddell. Plus Cheryl Campbell acted more like Liddell's fiancée than sister. The acting overall could have been a few notches higher, and there were moments when I found the character development, especially of Liddell to be weak. And I felt that a little more singing from Abraham was needed; he has a good singing voice. Chariots of Fire may not be immediately arousing but it will move you once you begin realizing the universality of the theme.
