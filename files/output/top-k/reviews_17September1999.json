When he had a supporting role in Boomerang, he was the best part of the film.  When he teamed with Will Smith in Bad Boys, the result was TNT.  Their chemistry together made the film as funny and successful as it was.  But when you put him in a film that has one of the sorriest excuses for a script that I have seen in some time, no matter how much of a genius he is, it is not enough to save the movie from disaster.  I really get bothered by films like this because someone along the Hollywood chain actually read this script and thought it was funny enough to invest money into it.  And I wonder what Lawrence actually thought when he read it.  My best guess is that he took one look at it and thought that he could do what Jim Carrey did with Ace Ventura, take the script and put his own brand of humour in it.  And while that worked for Carrey, there was no way in hell that it was going to work for this film.  No way!I'll dissect some simple silly scenes for you and then maybe you can decide for yourself.  Lawrence's main nemesis is an old robbery buddy that thrives on greed.  He finds out Lawrence's scam and decides he is going to wait for him to make a move and then grab the diamond for himself.  So as soon as he sees the white truck leaving the police station ( followed by about 8 police cars ) he decides to follow it and snatch the diamond from Lawrence.  Okay, let's see first of all, how did he know that Lawrence was going to be in that particular truck, secondly, why would he follow the truck when there is a harem of cops following it as well.  These are just small points that perhaps you overlook in a film if the film itself is good.  But when it is as pathetic as this one is, every fault, every glitch stares out at you like a full moon on a clear night.  Lawrence does what he can with the script but he is outmatched by sheer idiocy and there is nothing he can do about it.  I won't even go into the fact that his cover would have been blown in about a day, and that is being kind.  Blue Streak is an amateur production at best.  It sinks in it's own slush and it is a film that never should have been made.  I think it's really sad when you see what depths the film industry has sunk to to get a film in the can and out into the market.  I have to admit that this summer there were quite a few films that surprised me.  Usually summer blesses us with maybe two or three good films, but this time I can count about ten that were quite good.  You can add this film to one of the biggest disappointments, and considering it had a great trailer, it makes it that much more depressing.  So here is my advice to two of the abominations that came out this summer.  I think the makers of the trailers for The Haunting and Blue Streak should pitch an idea to the studios and tell them that they will direct.  After all, the makers of the trailers for those two movies are brilliant people.  They made me want to see their films.  It's just too bad that the rest of the film couldn't follow in their footsteps.

This had to have been one of my favorite movies.\tOne of the reasons it was such a good movie is that it was funny throughout the whole thing. Two really funny parts were when first Dr.Evil is drinking coffee and he gets foam on his nose. Second is when Dr.Evil's chair starts to go really fast in all directions. These are only two of the many funny scenes of this movie.\tThis movie is very unrealistic but it was still a good movie. Some examples of why it was unrealistic is that the characters are traveling through a time machine and that they are floating through space in some sort of rocket thing without needing to wear a space suit or helmets.These things would both probably never happen except maybe in the WAY future.\tAll in all I would really recommend this movie because I laughed throughout the majority of the movie and it had a good plot\/script even though it was not realistic I still thought it was an awesome movie!

Therefore, just get someone with a similar chin to Keaton and Kilmer....oh, George Clooney will do....and suit him up!This film is an incoherent mess from the beginning to the end. Overbudgeted, overplotted, and over-ambitious, it is a hideous mockery of everything good film making stands for. The first films were unique....combining dark elements with bits of comedy. Batman, after all, is the Dark Detective, not John Travolta from Grease! But this film abandons that fact, and abandons everything that made the first three films superior entertainment characters we care about, good direction, and and interesting premises.This time, we have three villians stepping out of the comic books Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, and Bane. They are about as underdeveloped as characters could get, and their motives for behaving badly are about as cliched as just about any given Steven Segal film. Especially Bane...I'm not very familiar with the comic book series, but what I do know about Bane is that he is a brilliant killer-for-hire for had dedicated his life to hunting Batman. That would have made a good film by itself, so why did they murder the character, severing all chance of a good sequel featuring his character? Instead of a brilliant psychopath, we now have a lumbering moron who's a cross between Lou Ferrigno's Hulk and Karloff's mute Frankenstein.That's not going into the good guys' role(if they can be called roles)....O'Donnell is sleepwalking, Silverstone's role is nothing short of a cameo, and Clooney...well....he's a good actor, but he just doesn't have enough to work with. Anybody would have done for this part, since it is so bland and emotionless. Anybody. Woody Allen....Kim Basinger....Harvey Fienstein....Anybody. The best actor in the film is Coolio, who's in it for about...oh...fifteen seconds....Schumacher....you did fine on Forever. For pete's sake, if you're going to direct again, at least let Burton produce so he can give you pointers. I mean, what is this crud? It's a wasted production.
