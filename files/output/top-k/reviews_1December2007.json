In the near future, 'mechas' (life-like robots) are very popular with humans; in fact, they have become so commonplace that they are taken for granted and used for practically everything. Only one type of mecha seems to be missing- one that can actually love its owner. And that is apparently solved by mechas like David, who is brought into a home where two parents are effectively childless since their own, real son lies in a suspended state, awaiting a cure for his incurable disease. Monica, the mother, gradually warms to David but then her real son is miraculously healed and returns home, setting up a conflict between the authentic and the artificial which the latter is bound to lose. Also present is another mecha of sorts, a walking, talking teddy bear named, well, Teddy, who provides a wry though childlike running commentary on things. With her own son back, Monica perhaps begins to feel guilty about ever taking David in as a 'replacement,' so one day she drives the mecha and his teddy bear to a remote spot in the forest and abandons them. The rest of the film concerns David's attempts to find his way back to Monica. Spielberg disputes that he took Stanley Kubrick's dark fable and overly sentimentalized it; in fact, he claims just the opposite, that the darkest scenes in the film are his. But 'sentimental' might be too easy a word anyway. First of all, it's very difficult for one watching to hope David gets his wish. Monica in an unlikeable character and clearly undeserving of David's 'love.' Therefore, the entire second part of the movie feels misguided. We certainly want David to be happy but we also know that is impossible if he returns to Monica, who would certainly abandon him again. On their journey, David and Teddy meet up with Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a prostitute mecha. There is a bizarre scene at a 'flesh fair,' where mechas are blown up, disfigured, and destroyed in front of cheering crowds (a parody it seems of Nascar, pro wrestling, and July 4). David narrowly escapes being destroyed and soon the three of them make their way to Rouge City, a sort of revved-up futuristic Las Vegas. David becomes convinced that the Blue Fairy (from 'Pinocchio') can show him the way home and determines to find her. This in turn leads them to Manhattan, which like all coastal cities on Earth by this point in time is under water from the ice caps having melted. David and Teddy end up in a submarine-type vehicle under water where the ruins of Coney Island lay. And there is a statue of the Blue Fairy. David makes a wish but the vessel becomes trapped and there he and Teddy sit for 2000 years. By this time, Earth has entered another ice age, and aliens (which are really evolved mechas) discover the two. They recreate Monica for David, but only for one day; the last shot is of Monica falling asleep, David next to her. The 'Pinocchio' connection would have been obvious in any event, but to confront it directly and literally is another bizarre twist in the story. David's adventures in Rouge City and the ending in Manhattan are two of the best scenes; the aliens' ship in particular is marvelously conceived, just disconnected panels that fly away when no longer needed. A.I. poses a lot more questions than it answers, not least of which is, does David really love, or is he just a machine that is programmed to act as though he does? Most viewers will simply accept that he is in fact capable of the emotion, but humans are forever attributing human characteristics and emotions to everything around them, from pets to plants to inanimate objects. The way in which Monica ultimately reacts to David suggests there is a part of her that realizes he cannot, in fact, truly love her. But then again, maybe Spielberg didn't mean that at all.

George Cukor's Oscar nominated Gaslight has the feel of something that was fresh and unique back when released in 1944, today, however, it feels as though it was from a bygone era, complete with acting that somehow has become laughable where it once showed brilliance. A slow burning plot is laid out, showing us the systemic destruction of a woman's mind. Our lead Paula found the body of her dead aunt\/caretaker when she was young. Now grown up, she has married a man in a whirlwind romance and decides to move back to the place of the murder with him. In that house, her mind begins to wander and frighten from sounds she hears at night and the dimming gaslights surrounding her. It appears she is also losing her mind and possibly stealing artifacts from around the house for no apparent reason and her husband's temper creeps out more and more as the time passes. The handling of the degenerative process concerning Paula is done well, but I feel that having seen so many movies like this one over the years ruined my experience. I pegged the conclusion and twist about fifteen minutes into the story and I have to say it was written on the wall quite loudly. Being, what could be, the first of its kind, that revelation at the end might have really stunned some people, now it just means we have to sit through some monotonous exposition and character progression before seeing what we all knew in the beginning was eventually going to happen.It's not even like we are on the cusp of sound evading film either, it happened almost two decades previous, but the acting almost comes across as too broad. Especially with lead actor Charles Boyer, who plays Paula's new husband Gregory Anton. He gives us shades of villainous facial expressions right from the get-go and never shows the audience anything to make us wonder if maybe he wasn't pure evil. With his role as it is, there can be no confusion of his motives and that, to me, takes away a huge part of this film. All suspense about what is happening is thrown out the window as soon as Paula discovers a letter from the past addressed to her deceased aunt. That moment seals Gaslight's fate. From there on, the only suspense was whether Paula's forced nervous breakdown would become real, making her fabricated insanity a reality.As far as Paula is concerned, I do believe Ingrid Bergman does a good job. Was the performance worthy of a Best Actress Oscar? I'd lean more towards no, but then I haven't seen any other film from that year, so for all I know she was the best. Her feigned waif persona comes across a little heavy-handed at the start, almost playing right into the fact that she was being lied to in order to think she was crazy. It felt like she knew her craziness was faked and had to play it up to make it appear more believable. This would have been a brilliant move if she knew what her husband was doing and was subverting his work to trick him, but that is not the case. It was just a somewhat hammy performance. I will say that towards the end, where the truth is slowly being revealed, she steps it up a bit and shines. Half a performance, though, does not a best of the year award make.The film is not without its charm either. Its conclusion is fun to watch and see what is truly going on with Boyer's role. A big part of that revelation is laid on the back of Joseph Cotten. Now here is a man that could act. I have never seen him in a role that wasn't believable or restrained in the realm of reality. He is the best part of the film and never misses a step. We are also treated to some comic relief from characters played by Dame May Witty, a neighbor, and the couple's live-in maid Angela Lansbury. In her first ever screen performance, Lansbury shows a lot of spunk and sarcastic wit. I also really enjoyed the atmosphere. Every foggy evening outside was beautifully shot and allowed the world without electricity to become a character of its own. As a whole, though, the film ultimately was too by-the-numbers and obvious to uncover its motives. I know this is all easy to say when so much has probably been lifted from it over the years, but that is where I'm coming from.

Identity is the first, and in my opinion, the second-best out of them all. It has the most originality to it, makes the character of Jason Bourne seem the most clever and even the more vulnerable than he does in the two following films, and is overall, a nifty action movie.Matt Damon was the perfect choice for playing Jason Bourne, a former assassin from a series of novels that failed in a mission, was injured, presumed dead, and later turned out alive only with amnesia. He soon finds out here's a target for assassination and must try and find the people he originally worked for, find out who he is, and why they are trying to kill him now. Damon is a very versatile actor and is very efficient at the role.Franka Potente's character, while not a major development or powerful character, was a necessary character to keep the story rolling. The fact is, the movie would have been more boring and less compelling if Boune was completely by himself at first. Potente's character is developed enough just to make the point of her being there, not so that the audience will become attached to her. And I think that was the general idea when they were piecing together the screenplay.Action sequences in The Bourne Identity were very clever and ingenious. Like the following two films, Bourne is realized as being like Rambo. He is able to use a variety of tools for his own defense. He can use a gun as well as his own fists, and if he needs a weapon, as he demonstrates in one scene, he can grab a pen and use it as effectively as if it were a knife. Of course, some of his kills were a bit unbelievable and humanly impossible, but then again, it's an action movie. Lots of them are like that and the audience is just to sit back and enjoy it. And the cool thing is that Bourne is, like Rambo, not just a random crazy killer, as we can assume he was before he got amnesia. He tries to spare his attackers whenever he can and only kills when it becomes clear to him, and the audience, that there is obviously no choice left to him.But what I like most of all about The Bourne Identity, as well as The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum is that it ends with several points unclear, making it obvious to the audience that there will be more to come. In each film, many questions are asked, some are answered, most are left unsolved. And in each entry, more are asked, more are answered, and even more are left. It's a representation of how Jason Bourne is thinking as he's put into these situations. And the audience effectively follows him.

Like the following two films, Bourne is realized as being like Rambo. He is able to use a variety of tools for his own defense. He can use a gun as well as his own fists, and if he needs a weapon, as he demonstrates in one scene, he can grab a pen and use it as effectively as if it were a knife. Of course, some of his kills were a bit unbelievable and humanly impossible, but then again, it's an action movie. Lots of them are like that and the audience is just to sit back and enjoy it. And the cool thing is that Bourne is, like Rambo, not just a random crazy killer, as we can assume he was before he got amnesia. He tries to spare his attackers whenever he can and only kills when it becomes clear to him, and the audience, that there is obviously no choice left to him.But what I like most of all about The Bourne Identity, as well as The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum is that it ends with several points unclear, making it obvious to the audience that there will be more to come. In each film, many questions are asked, some are answered, most are left unsolved. And in each entry, more are asked, more are answered, and even more are left.

Identity is the first, and in my opinion, the second-best out of them all. It has the most originality to it, makes the character of Jason Bourne seem the most clever and even the more vulnerable than he does in the two following films, and is overall, a nifty action movie.Matt Damon was the perfect choice for playing Jason Bourne, a former assassin from a series of novels that failed in a mission, was injured, presumed dead, and later turned out alive only with amnesia. He soon finds out here's a target for assassination and must try and find the people he originally worked for, find out who he is, and why they are trying to kill him now. Damon is a very versatile actor and is very efficient at the role.Franka Potente's character, while not a major development or powerful character, was a necessary character to keep the story rolling. The fact is, the movie would have been more boring and less compelling if Boune was completely by himself at first.

I thought great, a long OK movie where I don't have to think too much and it will make me feel better. Boy was I wrong. I had seen this in the theater when I was eight and again on TV with the radio tune in and thought it was the coolest, I was eight. I had seen it several times after and could never make it all the way through, but I tried again. This movie is so dull and cheesy I could not help giggling my way through half of it before I turned it off. 50inch wide screen high-def and surround sound didn't help a bit. And this is why...1. The pace of the film is so slow and characters so boring you don't even want to wait for the quake. And when it comes the ridiculousness of it is so overwhelming I laughed my ass off when I guess I should have been feeling bad for the lost souls. Best shot is when the guy is up on that house with stilts six minutes after the quake starts and is still holding a beer and a piece of fried chicken then drops 40 feet along with half the building but is still scampering down the hill at the end unscathed. And what's with the animated splash of blood when the elevator crashes? How did they come to a decision that that worked? Or the AMAZING stunt by Miles Quade that is just really nothing at all even for it's day but they have to say Evel Kenivel's name twice because he was so popular at the time.2. The acting is about as trite and over the top as you can get, but the lines are so badly written it is not really their fault, the director should have known better but it seems he liked everything he saw on the first take.3. One wordCARDBOARD. The Special effects look like they did them on their lunch hour. I'm sure a lot of people put their efforts into this but please. I read in one of the other comments that we should have pity on this mess because it was from the 70's and only had a 7 mil budget. What about films like 2001 A Space Odyssey, this film was six years earlier and only had around a 10 million dollar budget and it still looks incredible today. It's called good direction and caring about the product. This looked like it was rushed out faster then most of these actors careers.I felt sicker after watching this disaster of a disaster movie then I did when I started. This one was just plain DUMB.

And while 310 to Yuma does most certainly have gunfights and killings on screen, it does utilize its characters for its suspense and overall, dramatic power. It's not a major action movie, but it stands out for its strong characterization and original plot.The film is about a struggling farmer named Dan Evans (Heflin) who is under pressure by the drought. He needs two hundred dollars (an enormous amount of money back then) to buy water rights or else his cattle and his family will die of thirst. He witnesses a stage robbery done the gang of a notorious outlaw named Ben Wade (Ford) who end up killing a stage driver who gets a little too brave in the face of danger. Later on, Evans helps capture Wade in a nearby town and they plan to send him off to Yuma prison on a train that leaves at three-ten the next day. However, Wade's gang is not so willing to just let them do this....The characterization of the two main characters is remarkably amazing. Wade, though being a killer, is revealed not to be such a bad person at all. He's not a villain, but more like an anti-hero. He killed the stage driver in self defense and although he knows a violent shootout will certainly set him free (as he mentions numerous times in attempts to frighten his captors), he wants to avoid any trouble by convincing Evans to simply drop his shotgun and let him go free. Evans, however, is too proud and believes that since he started this job, he should finish it. They spend most of the screen time in a small, claustrophobic hotel room as they await the train's arrival, and they communicate. At first, calmly, and later on, intensely. Wade uses his smart mouth and quick mind to psych out Evans and tries to bribe him. Eventually, his wits begin to scare Evans' comrades into running out on him, but Evans will not back down, even though outnumbered seven to one. And when the train finally comes, it's just a long walk for the two of them through a town swarming with outlaws both on the ground and on the roofs, to the train station. Even if they get that far, there's sure to be more trouble waiting.One of the interesting creative aspects about 310 to Yuma is its bright and fluorescent cinematography. It's in black-and-white, but if it had been shot in color, then it would have had a very bright and unique aspect to itself. The cinematography gives the film an eerie aspect. And sometimes, it also gets darker and then lighter again. When it's darker, the suspense drops. But as Wade continues to psych out Evans, it seems to increase slightly, giving an eerie appearance and atmosphere.310 to Yuma is one of the classic landmark films of the 50s. It has recently been remade, a half-century after it was first released, and the remake is considered to be even more powerful than this film. I myself have not yet seen it, but whether or not I agree with what the critics say in their praise about it, I still defend that the the original is one of the best Westerns of all time. And one of the best thrillers of all time for its different style of using psychological techniques for thrills instead of noise and action.

Alhough (Joanne Whalley) made good performance but she is not that hot at all, so I was shouting all along (Vaaal ! Forget about her..

But I followed it anyway to watch the efficacy of that new double ! Though I've witnessed the destroying of that desire too ! Because in despite of some very strong music and creative cinematography they treated the story so tritely to make it highly predictable with nothing to entertain. It didn't achieve a grade but being customary, and didn't make anything smarter than the 699 other remakes that we've watched before ! So for one who grew up watching too many American movies & TV shows with too many twists, it was so damn easy to find out early about the couple of surprises at the end because simply I've learned from the best, but obviously the makers of this...didn't !

useful","review":" After seeing Alfred Hitchcock's classic Rear Window for the second time, I am even more convinced that the broo-haha surrounding Disturbia and its ripping it off was uncalled for. Besides the premise of a person confined to their window, seeing what they think is a murder, the two could not be anymore different. This film is one that will never age, whether it story, acting, or sheer inventiveness in its execution. Only Hitchcock could build the suspense as high as he does for almost two hours never leaving one room the entire time. Our hero is in a full leg cast and a prisoner to his room and window. Besides that interior, everything else we see is from his vantage point across to the rest of the apartment complex and a sliver of space opening to the street beyond. A clinic or choreography and showing us only what we need to know, Rear Window leaves you guessing right up until the final scene, unaware of what the whole truth to the situation is.Technically, the film has no flaws. Its utilization of a pivoting camera that pans left to right out L.B. Jefferies apartment is one-of-a-kind. With only the zooms from his camera lens and binoculars, we are allowed to see everything he does, letting us as the audience come to our own conclusions as well as become a part of his. This is a slow burn of a story, revealing each new discovery as though the layers of an onion peeled away. The sheer amount of rehearsals must have been staggering. There are plenty of long takes that go from window to window, catching the precise moment of activity we need in order to continue the story. Each actor had to be able to hit their mark at the exact moment necessary; timed to perfection. It is a joy to think about the work that went into the film every time we are shown characters moving from room to room, stopping at each window for our benefit, yet never feeling unnatural. Full credit goes to the cinematographer for orchestrating it all.The premise and craft are not the only things going for it. Acting-wise, there is not one misstep. James Stewart truly was the greatest actor of his generation. His delivery is uncanny and he can go from serious drama to light comedy without a blink. There is a lot of heavy emotional tension between him and his girlfriend that is treated with the same amount of care every other plot thread is. His relationship with Lisa Fremont, the gorgeous Grace Kelly, is mirrored in that of the quarrels and love trysts happening all around him. Without the murder mystery and the peeping into the lives of other couples, they may end up breaking up forever. His middle-class upbringing and photojournalist lifestyle just doesn't match well with her patrician ways and necessity of wearing a dress only once to keep appearances up for her job. The two could not be anymore different except for the fact they are madly in love with the other.Kelly is not just a pretty face either. Her performance is realistic at all times, keeping up with Stewart's sarcastic wit and playing the girlfriend being spurned all while slowly becoming engrossed in the story of the Thorwalds across the way. She becomes a photojournalist herself in many ways, looking through the camera and coming to conclusions for what the story may entail. In opposition to this, Stewart morphs into that which he thinks can never change in his love, her ability to stay on the fringe while others do the hard labor. Many times towards the end, he is the one left to watch others risk their safety for his manifested theories. He himself is the helpless being unable to go into the trenches, but instead prepare everything for the others to carry out. Whether Thorwald killed his wife or she has taken a train to visit family, the hold the mystery has on them finally shows the two what the other goes through and their respect for the other blossoms to become as strong as their love.My favorite aspect of the complete achievement, however, is the levity infused at all times. Sure the subject matter is very serious&#151;I wouldn't be surprised if it was at first created to be a commentary on the Red Scare and worrying about what your neighbors could be up to&#151;but at every turn we get witty banter helping to alleviate the tension and give us viewers a breather. Stewart and Kelly are quite the team and they perform the words of John Michael Hayes' script with ease. The timing is superb and many of the best lines are mixed into the dramatic dialogue always breaking up the suspense. We aren't talking gags and jokes, but instead puns and sly shots taken as a result of the conversations at hand. This is one smart script and I find myself even more interested in seeing The Man Who Knew Too Much&#151;the second version Hitchcock directed&#151;to see how well the team does, joined together again.

Dick stories really don't make it seem like it will be a pleasant era to be alive! In the year 2079, the people of earth live in a dome (like in The Simpsons Movie only much larger) and there's the constant threat that evil aliens kill you and replace you with a walking, talking time bomb replica. Charismatic and still severely underrated actor Gary Sinise stars as the successful and happily married (to Madeleine Stowe) weapon designer Spencer Olham, who's about to discuss a major warfare breakthrough with one of the earth's most important leaders. Hours before the meeting, however, army major Hathaway (Vincent D'Onofrio, another underrated class actor) arrests him under the suspicion of being an alien replica. Olham escapes into the ghetto wastelands, strongly motivated to convince to his wife, his opponents and even to himself that he's still his old human self instead of an explosive android. Impostor is an overall mediocre and unmemorable Sci-Fi movie, presumably because it was originally just intended to be 40 minutes segment in an anthology film. The stretching of Philip Dick's SHORT story premise is undoubtedly what ruined the intensity & disturbance-element of the concept, as the whole escape-and-quest-for-truth plot feels too overly familiar and derivative. The set designs and decors are impressive (although sometimes borrowed from contemporary Sci-Fi flicks) and often nightmarish, including brightly lit futuristic transportation vehicles and nifty new surgery techniques. Then, on other occasions, it seems like earth's technology and the human mind set hasn't developed at all. In the shower, for example, Spencer sings along with golden oldies like John Lee Hooker's Boom Boom that &#150; in 2079 &#150; must be more than 120 years old. It's possible, of course, but very unlikely considering the way musical tastes are evolving nowadays. Also, in some of the houses you can still find old-fashioned bathroom tabs and simplistic toothbrushes! Don't Sci-Fi movies usually go to any length to come up with crazy gimmicks? Impostor doesn't even try, apart from the obvious stuff. Generally, this is a disappointing and forgettable film; nothing even remotely as classic as some of the other Philip K. Dick adaptations available on the market, like Minority Report, Total Recall and of course Blade Runner. I watched Impostor shortly after its theatrical release in 2002 but didn't remember anything about the story when it aired on TV this week.

He makes controversial films that are sometimes unappreciated by the public and the critics. I said and believed all this even before I watched JFK.JFK is a film that stars many A-list actors in major and minor roles, but they give deep imprints nonetheless. Tommy Lee Jones, the Oscar nominated actor of the film, gives a performance that I almost missed due to my not recognizing him. Jones plays Clay Shaw, a powerful figure in New Orleans and a secret homosexual who knew about the plot to kill the president. Gary Oldman is fantastic as the widely publicized murderer, Lee Harvey Oswald. Joe Pesci, fresh from his Oscar in Goodfellas, as Dave Ferrie, a man who is struggling to cope with the heavy accusations and mysteries of the JFK murder. Donald Sutherland in an Oscar-worthy performance, as an informant that talks to Jim Garrison, played wonderfully by Kevin Costner. Other great appearances include Kevin Bacon, Sissy Spacek, Michael Rooker, and even Walter Matthau in a bit appearance.Many of these fine performances were worthy of Oscars, but if there is one man that deserved an Oscar more than anyone else, it would have to be Oliver Stone, who did not win Best Director OR Best Picture. Who did he lose to? Silence of the Lambs. While I do consider the film to be an excellent thriller featuring one of Anthony Hopkins' greatest performances, I must say that in terms of scope and daring, JFK was a far superior film. The cinematography was far more varied and ambitious, as well as the subject matter itself. I can understand why JFK was passed over, but the reasons are not fair to the extraordinary film given to us.The appearance of JFK is astounding. You are taken to a time of much distrust, horror, confusion, corruption, and cover-up. The murders of JFK, Martin Luther King, and RFK all influenced the time periods and the peoples. Many people tried not to think about it, or else they were scared into silence. Some, like Jim Garrison, tried to present the truth of JFK, and their efforts are being felt even now.Before I saw this film, I had seen Oliver comment that JFK was a movie in which he got all the crazy theories and presented them. He was not implying that everything was true, and some of it isn't true. But after seeing this film, I am convinced there was definitely more to the story than was originally told, as I believed even before I saw JFK. This gave me a knowledge of the period, and awareness of the people participating in the drama of the time.The point of the film is not entirely based on the story of the JFK assassination. It is an outcry from Oliver Stone to remind us that truth is never simple, nor is it always presented by the government. People must struggle to find the truth sometimes, and if it is covered up, it could be lost forever. The film is an attempt to show us that the murder of President Kennedy was a time of much confusion and mix-up. So what was true and what was not? Many eye-witnesses gave conflicted views, while other circumstances were strange in their origins and happening. And while he gave us this, Oliver Stone also presented us with the best film that he has yet made, and his resume is incredible as it is.I have seen the films Platoon and Born on the Fourth of July films that Oliver Stone won Best Director for. Why did he not win for JFK? Why did it only win 2 Oscars? For me, it is another example of how disappointing the Oscar results can be. I urge all to see this epic film of mystery and deceit, of truth and lies, the work of a master film director known as Oliver Stone.

In fact, one might say that that it actually serves as the moral for a story that after all was aimed at children.

The movie begins with his birth and unfolds as we watch Simba mature from a young cub to a youthful lion (the transition occurring in the wilderness after his evil uncle Scar kills off his father). The movie concludes with Simba regaining his rightful place in the circle of life and becoming a father himself (after an epic fight with Scar. The battle was one of the best scenes of the movie. Extremely Powerful.) And as far as the animation goes, everything is top notch. The songs of the movie were hit songs with Hakuna Matata becoming a sort of an anthem for a while, I think.
