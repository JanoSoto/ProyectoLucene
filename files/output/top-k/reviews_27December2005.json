It was innovative and creative to say the least - especially with its use of bullet time which was a cinematic style that was never attempted before. And the story is very interesting - it involves an apocalyptic future where most people are jacked in to the Matrix, a real world virtual reality representation of the late 20th century. There are those who realize it isn't real and would stop at nothing to destroy the Matrix from the machines that have enslaved most of the human populace - and they would accomplish this in a belief that Neo, The One, will bring about this revolution. A great film that should be cherished - a superb 9 out of 10.

For me as a European citizen, Andy Kaufman is a complete mystery. I've never seen any of his performances in Saturday Night Live nor have I ever seen any of his live shows. After seeing the movie five times, I as a Dutch not-knowing citizen who had never heard of Kaufman before, can make an image of the man and his brilliance. This is all thanks to Milos Forman and a stunning Jim Carrey, who really becomes Andy Kaufman. According to me, this movie is where Jim Carrey proves that he is just more than a funny guy, and after seeing him in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) Carrey has really proved that he is in fact a character actor.
