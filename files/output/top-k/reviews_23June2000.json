When I saw the movie, all my fears were put to rest. In fact, some of the culture clash scenes of the Bradys interacting with the rest of the world were the best, such as McKean's character not understanding a word of what she's saying because of her lisp, an attempted carjack Well, this is a car. But my name's not Jack! and Marcia's best female friend being a lesbian with a hopeless crush on her. THere's not really enough room to say enough good things about this movie. I've had a long week so I'll just list them- FIrst, the dead-on impressions are great, especially Alice, Jan, and Marcia, but Robert Reed is really the standout-he sounds more like Mike Brady than Mike Brady, and has his mannerisms down perfect. Lots of in-jokes and references that kids who didn't watch the show won't get but those of us like me that did will get for instance, when Carol kisses Mike goodbye when he leaves for work, she says, See ya, Tiger!(pause) Tiger...Tiger...I wonder what ever happened to that dog? the blackboard in the kitchen has porkchops and applesauce written on it, etc. They even manage to throw in a reference Johnny Bravo. The period detail is great (now that I see it as an adult, I realize the Brady's house was actually pretty cool looking), including the costumes. There's some little sexual innuendo thrown in, but it fits in with the movie and the characters perfectly-one of the funniest scenes is when Carol and Mike think they're alone, and she's sitting on his lap whispering what is probably talking dirty in his ear, and he's saying Uh-huh...You would...I see... exactly like Mike Brady does when he's talking to someone on the phone. They include the popular Brady songs like Sunshine Day (always kind of grated on me, but they do a great version in a Sears store) and the horrible one that starts Clowns never laughed before... but Keep On is actually a pretty catchy one. They recreate many famous moments from the show, such as Marcia's nose getting broken (Oh!My nose!) to Jan's delight, potato sack races, Jan hating her new glasses, Peter (or is it Bobby-for some reason those are the only 2 names I can't keep straight) being the Safety Monitor at school, and plenty more. The plot (yes, it actually has one)involves the Brady family's efforts to save their beloved home from an evil land-developer. Highly recommended, even if you're not a Brady completist. Watch for the cameos from 4 original cast members-the best was the real Alice playing a truck driver (hmmm, always though Alice was a little butch) picking up hitch-hiking Jan who has run away from home.  Most importantly to me, though this is a parody, the moviemakers make fun of the show while still staying true to the spirit of it and the characters. All their naivete (spelled wrong, I know...) is actually sweet rather than annoying-Marcia wears hideous 70's clothes but carries herself like a princess, Greg wants to make friends with the car-jacker, assuming he must need a spare tire, Mike explains how he wouldn't sell his house for any price because he designed it himself with love. During one scene, Marcia and Jan go to a modeling tryout (Jan is instantly booted)and the photographer\/agent tells her she needs to cut her hair, get plastic surgery, and lose weight. She slaps, him horrifiedCUT MY HAIR?? How dare you! Greg's lines to pick up chicks (well, it seems like this is his only opening pickup line) is Hey groovy chick.

I have seen hundreds of films. I don't think I have ever seen more than two or three that combined what I consider to be the five basic aspects requisite for consideration as a masterpiece. This is one of those films. The five basic elements are great acting--in which we the viewer see the character, feel the character, not the actor; a great score\/sound-track; a cinematic quality that enables the viewer to experience the surroundings, not just view them; great dialogue and non-dialogue--the best scripts usually utilize not only the verbal abilities of actors, but non-verbal expression as well (see a film with Cary Grant or Robert De Niro to know what I mean); and most important a compelling story.The Shawshank Redemption not only offers ALL of these, but does so at a level few films have ever reached.The basic plot is simple enough a man is wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and the man with whom she is having an affair. Why then is it so great? The performances, all around, but especially of Robbins and Freeman are so rich, so human, the viewer feels they are living their experiences. The film demonstrates, magnificently, how a man can create a meaningful life against horrid (mentally and physically) circumstances. The film wrenches the guts of its viewers, yet provides great satisfaction in the end. It is a great film celebrating determination, friendship, revenge (as sweet as you will ever see), education, and the basic goodness intrinsic to all people.

I don't think I have ever seen more than two or three that combined what I consider to be the five basic aspects requisite for consideration as a masterpiece. This is one of those films. The five basic elements are great acting--in which we the viewer see the character, feel the character, not the actor; a great score\/sound-track; a cinematic quality that enables the viewer to experience the surroundings, not just view them; great dialogue and non-dialogue--the best scripts usually utilize not only the verbal abilities of actors, but non-verbal expression as well (see a film with Cary Grant or Robert De Niro to know what I mean); and most important a compelling story.The Shawshank Redemption not only offers ALL of these, but does so at a level few films have ever reached.The basic plot is simple enough a man is wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and the man with whom she is having an affair. Why then is it so great? The performances, all around, but especially of Robbins and Freeman are so rich, so human, the viewer feels they are living their experiences. The film demonstrates, magnificently, how a man can create a meaningful life against horrid (mentally and physically) circumstances. The film wrenches the guts of its viewers, yet provides great satisfaction in the end. It is a great film celebrating determination, friendship, revenge (as sweet as you will ever see), education, and the basic goodness intrinsic to all people.
