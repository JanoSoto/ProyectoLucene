[{"date":"18 July 2014","score":"","review":" Haha I have two words for you guys Kronk. He is definitely by far the funniest person in the movie The Emperor's New Groove by Disney. I like how he is voiced by Joe from family guy. It's nice to see Patrick Warburton doing another voice for an animated character because it feels like he NEVER does that. My favorite part is when Kronk is trying to dispose of the body of the supposed recently deceased Kuzco because his boss wants him to (who hasn't been there right guys? ROFL) but he does the stereotypical angel devil shoulder thing. I also like that John Goodman is in it because who doesn't love John Goodman? He's a national treasure (tm). All in all you should watch it because David Spade is in it and honestly guys he needs the work. Maybe if you watch this he will be hired for more things.
