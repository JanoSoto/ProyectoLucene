How it is only rated 7.5 and not even in the top 25 or so, let alone outside the top 250, is totally beyond me. I loved this film when I was 6, I love it just as much today and I'll wager I'll love it when I'm 40.Don't rate this on the quality of sequels as the Lost World was not brilliant and JPIII was dire overkill. The original has good acting, exciting plot line and some parts are even unpredictable (e.g. when Timmy gets fried on the fence!). Some characters (Nedry, Arnold, Muldoon, the Lawyer) get killed and although none of the major characters die you have to expect that.One thing that really counts in favour of Jurassic Park is the brilliant music. Two main themes that go hand in hand, portraying the emotional parts and the pure action... I recently got the film out of the cupboard just to watch the credits, and with it the marvellous music! The ending scenes, where suddenly after the thrill of 1 T Rex destroying everything we get 5 or 6 Velociraptors hunting methodically, are chilling. The scene in the Kitchen especially gets nerves jangling, whilst the complex where Ellie finds Mr. Arnold's hand is brilliantly done as well.My only criticism perhaps is that some parts were too predictable. It would have been interesting to see one of the kids being killed about an hour in, as that would set up a situation where major characters COULD die and make the ending scenes that much more tense - but then, that would have been playing with Crichton's storyline.I'd like to see a version where some of the effects are done up and perhaps a director's cut. It's certainly been long enough and Lucasarts, who seem to have done many of the special effects, have progressed to another level since then.

Julianne Moore plays a disillusioned young housewife who starts to slowly develop allergy after allergy, until she is effectively unable to co-exist with the busy city environment around her. As a result she embarks on a journey both physical and spiritual to come to terms with her crippling allergies.Right. Plot synopsis out of the way, how does Safe work? Pretty well actually. I don't necessarily agree with the popular summary that Safe is a 'horror movie for the soul' as there's much more to it than that, the summary suggests it's like Ring with allergies, which is selling it short at best. Safe is basically a human drama about someone who has to deal with strange and extreme circumstances, and decides to take equally strange and extreme measures. Via this, director Todd Haynes is able to both examine and partially satirise middle-America's values and accepted environment, and the self-help\/new medicine craze of recent years.He does this with care and emotion, taking a good hard look at Moore's character and the things she surrounds herself with. Moore's character is both obviously unhappy but also too timid to say anything herself, so the allergies seem almost like an internal rebellion from her body, and her journey away from the city an escape for both body and soul. It's a fairly deep movie, and it's nice to see something that grapples with society at large and actually tries to say something as opposed to a movie that seems firmly entertainment.That said, you need some entertainment. If Safe has a weakness, it is its focus. There is almost no external detail to Moore's life, with even her family painted in giant broad brushstrokes. As a result the movie is a singularly lonely experience although I feel in part this is intentional.

Certain sequences so accurately portray the experience of being really ill that you almost feel ill yourself, and the movie is an artistic triumph, with every shot looking absolutely spot on.So, I recommend Safe.

I don't necessarily agree with the popular summary that Safe is a 'horror movie for the soul' as there's much more to it than that, the summary suggests it's like Ring with allergies, which is selling it short at best. Safe is basically a human drama about someone who has to deal with strange and extreme circumstances, and decides to take equally strange and extreme measures. Via this, director Todd Haynes is able to both examine and partially satirise middle-America's values and accepted environment, and the self-help\/new medicine craze of recent years.He does this with care and emotion, taking a good hard look at Moore's character and the things she surrounds herself with. Moore's character is both obviously unhappy but also too timid to say anything herself, so the allergies seem almost like an internal rebellion from her body, and her journey away from the city an escape for both body and soul. It's a fairly deep movie, and it's nice to see something that grapples with society at large and actually tries to say something as opposed to a movie that seems firmly entertainment.That said, you need some entertainment. If Safe has a weakness, it is its focus. There is almost no external detail to Moore's life, with even her family painted in giant broad brushstrokes.

I especially love how Brooks, in all his movies, plays several different roles. I figure, if you want it done right, sometimes you just have to do it yourself.However funny it might be, there are definitely some raunchy parts.

There is no way that it would be rated that today though. There isn't any nudity, its just a WHOLE lot of sexual jokes.

I guess one of my friends brought it to me and I just copied it without knowing.The movie is amazing in graphics, in imagery, sounds, voices, a 10\/10 if you were to ask me. I sat glued to the screen till the very end. Since I just found out this was a sequel I will not write much since I have not seen the first part, however I might write a few pointers as to what you're about to experience if you let yourself get into this adventure, love story type of vampiristic action and in some parts comedy and drama.The Vampire Hunter D is a bounty hunter, by all means it means he kills for money. He is also half-human, half-vampire which gives him the power to walk outside during the day but it also means he has less strength than the real vampire right? Nope! Here he might be able to walk outside during the day but he is also as strong as the next full pledged vampire. After a rich man's daughter is kidnapped he is assigned for the mission along with another team whom he is competing against for the bounty money. Apparently a vampire has kidnapped the daughter and as for there, probably the last vampire left. There is no need to mention that the plot is only that skin deep, there is much more to it but then again you'd have to watch the movie to understand and see it cause I am not gonna be a movie pooper, so there. Along the lines of getting the money, there are beautiful fighting scenes, a lot of action and yes, as I said earlier, love involved. So please don't miss this movie, rent it, buy it, borrow it, but see it for it is a must see, a movie that you'll remember.

With the exception of the beautiful cinematography, the comments of pro-Gate readers are beyond my wildest understanding. I have degrees in political science and history so this is an interesting genre for me. But unlike the brilliant Unforgiven, this film is horrifying to look at. And as others have noted, once you have been punished for hours watching a train wreck in progress, you desperately hope for some redemption in the end. Boy do you not get it. Worst of all, the movie needs to just stop after the battle scene...please just stop. This was bad enough to watch these citizens riding around and around and around and no really shooting, much less hitting anything. Did anyone think of having a battle plan perhaps? And why is the prostitute leading them? It is embarrassing and degrading to the heroic immigrants to be wasted in this way. And then it just won't end. You have to have a scene in which the last two decent characters are killed off and it is such a strange scene. While the rest of the movie has endless (and by this I mean ENDLESS) footage in each scene, ending in nothing, this last shooting scene is like a drive by -- literally. There is a drive by shooting at the end with horses. And then, it still can't end. You have to have the bizarre ship scene. I don't know what anyone was thinking about in this movie outside of how beautiful it looks. The best scenes are of dancing, and skating and more dancing, and...did I mention dancing?

I know it's easy to trash this movie and I think I know why -- it could have been so great and it makes you so angry that it's so bad.

How could anybody ever hope to follow up an act like that? Well, it turns out to be a pretty nifty movie in its own right. The filmmakers wisely avoided getting pretentious about the subject matter. Don't forget, Hitchcock himself regarded Psycho as a black comedy, and Psycho II maintains a more obvious sense of humor than the original. It's not played entirely straight, especially by Anthony Perkins. Naturally Perkins was the only one who could play Norman Bates, since he had become synonymous with the part.The plot finds Norman being released from the sanitarium after 22 years of incarceration, much to the chagrin of Lila Loomis (Vera Miles), who apparently made off with Marion's boyfriend, Sam, after Marion was discovered to have been murdered by Norman. Rehabilitated to the point where he's deemed fit to live among society again, Norman returns to the only place he knows, the little motel just outside of Fairvale. The hospital has placed him at a part time job in a diner not far from the motel, and here he meets a young naive waitress named Mary (Meg Tilly). Thrown out of her apartment by her boyfriend, she needs a place to stay and is taken in by Norman, who is happy to have the company. When Norman fires the sleazy manager who is running the Bates Motel (Dennis Franz), the man turns up dead, and this begins a series of murders that bear a strong resemblance to the murders committed by mother all those years ago. Is Norman cracking up again? Or is something more sinister going on? The script has a few weak points, most of which require a very large stretch of the imagination to account for the hairpin turns of the plot. Even though it might not be completely logical, the acting in the film makes up for it. Anthony Perkins is wonderful as Norman, who is just as compelling as he was in the first film. Meg Tilly is great in this movie, too, and they form a touching friendship that takes a surprising turn halfway through the film when we realize her background. The movie has a couple of suspenseful scenes that don't rely on the trendy graphic violence that was typical at the time, but eventually the movie goes for gore at the conclusion, which tacks on a couple of silly but shockingly outrageous on-screen kills.I don't think the movie would work without the fact that we genuinely care about the characters. Despite Mary's agenda, you can tell that she really likes Norman, and maybe even admires him for the way he's tried so hard to make a recovery from his mental illness. When the movie ends, I was surprised at how very real it was to see Norman's sadness at losing his new friend. Perkins also echoes the is he mad or isn't he? theme of Hamlet, although by the end of the movie there's no doubt about the answer to that question.Revisiting the locations from Hitchcock's original is interesting enough, but Psycho II works well on its own.

Thrown out of her apartment by her boyfriend, she needs a place to stay and is taken in by Norman, who is happy to have the company. When Norman fires the sleazy manager who is running the Bates Motel (Dennis Franz), the man turns up dead, and this begins a series of murders that bear a strong resemblance to the murders committed by mother all those years ago. Is Norman cracking up again? Or is something more sinister going on? The script has a few weak points, most of which require a very large stretch of the imagination to account for the hairpin turns of the plot. Even though it might not be completely logical, the acting in the film makes up for it. Anthony Perkins is wonderful as Norman, who is just as compelling as he was in the first film. Meg Tilly is great in this movie, too, and they form a touching friendship that takes a surprising turn halfway through the film when we realize her background. The movie has a couple of suspenseful scenes that don't rely on the trendy graphic violence that was typical at the time, but eventually the movie goes for gore at the conclusion, which tacks on a couple of silly but shockingly outrageous on-screen kills.I don't think the movie would work without the fact that we genuinely care about the characters. Despite Mary's agenda, you can tell that she really likes Norman, and maybe even admires him for the way he's tried so hard to make a recovery from his mental illness. When the movie ends, I was surprised at how very real it was to see Norman's sadness at losing his new friend. Perkins also echoes the is he mad or isn't he? theme of Hamlet, although by the end of the movie there's no doubt about the answer to that question.Revisiting the locations from Hitchcock's original is interesting enough, but Psycho II works well on its own. It's one of my favorite sequels to any film, and a great movie to revisit every once in a while.

It is a very low-budget, 'psuedo-Sci-Fi' film. 'Psuedo', because it is most definitely not serious about being 'Sci-Fi'. All of the 'science' is portrayed totally tongue-firmly-in-cheek. If you didn't get that with the baby bang reference from Doctor Penny Priddy during the press conference scene, well, then I'm sorry, but you're hopeless.If anything, this is an anti-Sci-Fi film. It's a spoof of all those 1950's-era Sci-Fi films where the incredibly bad science interpretation is played completely seriously. I mean, c'mon, the Overthruster tracking device with the UPS-truck turn-signal click should have clued you in that someone isn't quite serious here.What we've got here is a great romp with some future mega-stars having a great time. Lithgow's performance alone is worth the price of admission. Ellen Barkin is luscious in both that pink dress and her tied-up black skirt. That jail-cell flirtation scene... well, what more can I say? Those wonderful in-jokes Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems. YOYO-dyne? The Future Begins Tomorrow... well, of course it does. Negative, we do not have crossover... we are over New Jersey. All is not lost. Well, of course it isn't... or is it? (Born and raised there, Woodbridge Twp., sorry. To this day, my sister and brother-in-law live in New Brunswick, I'm not making this up.) If you own the DVD, as I do, then you probably know that practically nothing was created for this film. The Red Lectroid bivouac was an abandoned Firestone tire factory. If you ever did high-school drama, you probably recognized Lizardo's foot-pedals as an ancient lighting dimmer board. The spinning Styrofoam cup in the shock tower (an automotive term) takes the cake.There is so much going on in this low-low-budget film to laugh with, not at. If you watch this film looking not to trash it but to laugh with it, I think you will get far, far more out of it.I only wish they had been able to make the sequel.And finally, I originally saw this film when it was first released, in the Harvard Square cinema in Cambridge, Mass. The screening was sparsely attended, but you could tell that some people got it even then, and many didn't. Too bad.

The other prisoner of war movie to gain popularity with the general population was Stalag 17 with Robert Ryan as the bad guy. Does it matter.

Enough roadblocks are thrown up to make it fun. And, of course, this is a real prison camp with real guards and real bullets. No one should look at the ripoff mentality of Hogan's Heroes and think that there is a comparison.
