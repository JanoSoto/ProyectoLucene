Of course, the words 'Italian horror' and 'character study' are not the kind of stuff you read in the same review. That is what makes this intriguing little film, along with Argento's psychological thriller STENDHAL SYNDROME, one of the last great horror films to come out of Italy. DELLAMORTE DELLAMORE was even given a theatrical release in Uncle Sam's land circa 1996 under the name CEMETERY MAN and it did quite well thanks to Rupert Everett's star power.We know this is going to be something special from the very first scene After the camera zooms out of a skull (very cool effect) we are inside a small room while a young man answers a phone call. Then someone knocks on his door and when he opens it&#133; tcham! A rotten zombie enters the room. The audience is surprised, but the man isn't as he grabs a gun and calmly shoots the thing in the head. He returns to the phone like it was some bizarre daily routine as the camera reveals he lives right by a cemetery. Roll titles.We then learn, through a continuous narration, that the man happens to be Francesco Dellamorte (Rupert Everett) a caretaker of a local cemetery of a small Italian town. Dellamorte is one lonely and unhappy man The entire town makes fun of him for being apparently impotent and having a miserable sex life. Every night, with the help of his mute nerdy assistant Gnaghi (Francois Hadji-Lazaro) he is forced to dispose of the living dead who return from their graves seven days after their burial. This is a major factor of the film that is left unexplained as we are left to assume the zombies exist thanks to an unknown plague. It doesn't even matter anyways, this is the whole set-up of the movie and instead of having a linear plot, Gianni Romoli's sharp script (based on an Italian comic book series) is a string of semi-unconnected events that shape the film as an episodic piece. In fact, one could somehow consider DELLAMORTE DELLAMORE as an anthology film linked together by the characters.Throughout the film's duration, Francesco falls in love with many nameless women (all of them are played by the same actress Anna Falchi) and these affairs usually end in bad consequences. The first woman is recently widowed nymph who is apparently turned on by ossuaries. When her jealous husband comes back to the grave and kills her, Dellamorte is left shocked and hopeless. But fortunately for him she is buried in that exact cemetery and not even death can split them apart. Then he ends up falling to the mayor's secretary who happens to have a strange phobia that forces Dellamorte to give up his manhood for love. Will he do it? And finally there is a strange college girl who ends up being too easy. What is her secret? These affairs end up driving Dellamorte insane until the point where he becomes a serial murderer and gets back at all the town folks that originally made fun of him. But is Dellamorte really committing the murders? Or is it someone else? Are those women real or a product of his imagination? Is his insanity getting out of hand? CEMETERY MAN is so unusual for an Italian horror film, a genre that has been fairly stereotyped over the years as hot-blooded women being chased by schizophrenic, knife-wielding, black-gloved killers. It actually has interesting dialogue, sharp plot, and strong character development. Not only that, but it is filled with black humor that actually works. One of the (many) comedic subplots involves Dellamorte's mute assistant Gnaghi falling in love with the mayor's daughter named Velantina (Fabiana Formica) who is later decapitated at a road accident. Guess to whom Valentine's (talking) zombified head hooks up? The Valentina\/Gnaghi subplot is actually a very sweet and funny touch in the film and you actually feel sorry at the tragic outcome. The ridiculous idea of a talking head reminded me of Dario Argento's terrible attempt that same year in TRAUMA where the Italian maestro used it in a serious tone. It all gets more bizarre when Mayor Scanerotti (Stefanio Mascearelli) uses his daughter's death as political propaganda, proving that politicians don't have a soul indeed. During the beginning of the film I thought Detective Straniero's (Mickey Knox) failure at suspecting there was something wrong with Dellamorte was a plot hole when later I realized it was actually being played for laughs. And I laughed. Is CEMETERY MAN parodying the usual narrative problems with Italian horror?The entire movie is revolved around Rupert Everett who is given a lot to do here from the narration to the actual on-screen performance. It is a shame that Everett's performance in this is never mentioned when people talk about his work. In fact, his horrendous role along with Madonna in 1999's NEXT BEST THING gets more recognition. I would go as far as saying Francesco Dellamorte is the strongest role I ever saw Everett play. He nails the character's offbeat sense of humor from the very first scene and seems to play the whole thing dead serious, making us somehow laugh anyway. This is a performance that proves that we can always take an actor's performances seriously, no matter what his\/her real-life sexual preference is.Michele Soavi was one of the most enigmatic horror directors to come out of Italy. Being a strong protégé of Dario Argento early on his career, the young gifted director completed many music videos as well as some documentaries and assistant-director credits before making his directorial debut in 1987's STAGFRIGHT. With the international success of that film, Soavi soon became hot stuff and was said being the next carrier of the torch that was originally passed from Mario Bava to Argento, but sadly it wasn't so. After directing four acclaimed films (with CEMETERY MAN being the last) Soavi retired and isolated himself from the movie-making business never to be heard from the international public again. Sad really, one can only imagine what his career would have been like if he kept directing because Cemetery MAN is so well-crafted.

From the eyebrow-raising introduction to the enigmatic conclusion, it will be frustrating to know that Michele Soavi wasn't able to save the Italian horror industry from being taken over by Asian horror as the major alternative from Hollywood slasher flicks and now the industry is far from the 70s glory it once had, with Dario Argento managing to come out with a few minor hits over the years.(5\/5)  ","genre":null},{"date":"9 June 2004","score":"22 out of 30 people found the following review useful","review":"  Michele Soavi's DELLAMORTE DELLAMORE is not to be confused for a zombie splatter flick, it is actually a strong character study in form of a black comedy.

The estate was palatial, replete with faux classical Greek statues of human figures in various states of dress and undress. The tycoon, unimpressed with all that shiny white marble, had the statues painted togas became flashy robes, faces got make overs and even hair was treated to the equivalent of dye jobs, including in the pubic region. The tycoon was proud of his 3-D coloring book, but the neighbors were properly aghast. Instead of fitting in, the tycoon, to his amazement, became a laughing stock.Any similarities between the tycoon and Gus Van Sant are rather obvious. Like so many filmmakers who become critics' darlings, after his success with GOOD WILL HUNTING, Van Sant was struck with the horrifying delusion that he could do no wrong. For reasons that defy common sense, let alone good taste, the director got it into his head that he was just the man to remake of one of the greatest films of all time, Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO -- despite the fact that Van Sant had never made any film that could even in the wildest sense be termed Hitchcockian. Not intent with just revamping the story to create an homage to Hitchcock's masterwork, Van Sant decided to re-film PSYCHO scene-for-scene, using the original script and imitating Hitchcock's style set up for set up. His personal contribution To do it in color. Just like slappin' a coat of paint on a statue. And just as vulgar.If you have never seen the original PSYCHO then this 1998 remake has the empty efficiency of a TV-movie-of-the-week. It has no depth; it has no style; only the bland eagerness to fill up space between commercial interruptions. And there would be nothing wrong with that per se, if that were its intentions. But Van Sant was motivated, not by simple greed, but by an apparent desire to actually make a good movie and one that would compare favorably to Hitchcock's original. Certainly it must have seemed like a great idea to adhere as much as possible to Joseph Stefano's original adaptation. Indeed, the screenplay for PSYCHO is arguable one of the finest ever written cleverly deceptive, full of surprises, with sharp dialogue and intriguing characters. But, in an attempt to show just how important the screenplay is, Van Sant only seems to have shown what a minor role it actually plays in creating a great, or even watchable film. Both versions of PSYCHO are based on the same template, but side by side they are comparable to the Mona Lisa and a paint-by-numbers imitation. The devil is in the details, and Van Sant botches them right down the line.Here's one In the 1960 version Janet Leigh is first seen in a white bra and slip; when she decides to risk everything and steal some money, she is next seen in black underwear. The symbolism is obvious, maybe even slight, but ever so effective. In the remake, Anne Heche is first seen in orange underwear, then in green underwear. Why? The choice of colors is meaningless, other than to show that Heche's character has bad taste in underwear. The whole movie is like that, color is used just because color is possible. I'm not sure how much thought Hitchcock put into choosing to make PSYCHO in black and white (legend has it that he did it just because it was cheaper at the time), but Van Sant makes no apparent attempt to use color effectively. Indeed, at times, his PSYCHO is so bright and chipper it hardly seems like a suspense drama at all. I don't necessarily think Hitchcock's PSYCHO had to be in black and white to be great, but it is great partly because of the richness and texture of its black and white cinematography. Van Sant's version isn't bad because it is in color, but because he puts no thought into his use of color -- indeed, the film looks better with the color tuned off on the television. The original PSYCHO is often thought of as being a director's film, a work whose success is primarily based on Hitchcock's style. But to see just how much the actors contributed one need only compare the cast and the casting of the two films. Anne Heche has none of the sexuality of Janet Leigh, but worse she plays the part like some spaced-out little flower child. She's neither sexy nor smart. Vince Vaughn finds none of the child-like sweetness of Anthony Perkins' Norman Bates, instead Vaughn plays the part with a giggling creepiness; you distrust his Norman from the start. Heche and Vaughn are just terrible; her performance has no weight, his has no depth. William H. Macy does a credible job as Arbogast the detective, but he has none of the presence of Martin Balsam, who made the character seem indestructible.

The estate was palatial, replete with faux classical Greek statues of human figures in various states of dress and undress. The tycoon, unimpressed with all that shiny white marble, had the statues painted togas became flashy robes, faces got make overs and even hair was treated to the equivalent of dye jobs, including in the pubic region. The tycoon was proud of his 3-D coloring book, but the neighbors were properly aghast. Instead of fitting in, the tycoon, to his amazement, became a laughing stock.Any similarities between the tycoon and Gus Van Sant are rather obvious. Like so many filmmakers who become critics' darlings, after his success with GOOD WILL HUNTING, Van Sant was struck with the horrifying delusion that he could do no wrong. For reasons that defy common sense, let alone good taste, the director got it into his head that he was just the man to remake of one of the greatest films of all time, Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO -- despite the fact that Van Sant had never made any film that could even in the wildest sense be termed Hitchcockian. Not intent with just revamping the story to create an homage to Hitchcock's masterwork, Van Sant decided to re-film PSYCHO scene-for-scene, using the original script and imitating Hitchcock's style set up for set up. His personal contribution To do it in color. Just like slappin' a coat of paint on a statue. And just as vulgar.If you have never seen the original PSYCHO then this 1998 remake has the empty efficiency of a TV-movie-of-the-week. It has no depth; it has no style; only the bland eagerness to fill up space between commercial interruptions. And there would be nothing wrong with that per se, if that were its intentions. But Van Sant was motivated, not by simple greed, but by an apparent desire to actually make a good movie and one that would compare favorably to Hitchcock's original. Certainly it must have seemed like a great idea to adhere as much as possible to Joseph Stefano's original adaptation. Indeed, the screenplay for PSYCHO is arguable one of the finest ever written cleverly deceptive, full of surprises, with sharp dialogue and intriguing characters. But, in an attempt to show just how important the screenplay is, Van Sant only seems to have shown what a minor role it actually plays in creating a great, or even watchable film. Both versions of PSYCHO are based on the same template, but side by side they are comparable to the Mona Lisa and a paint-by-numbers imitation. The devil is in the details, and Van Sant botches them right down the line.Here's one In the 1960 version Janet Leigh is first seen in a white bra and slip; when she decides to risk everything and steal some money, she is next seen in black underwear. The symbolism is obvious, maybe even slight, but ever so effective. In the remake, Anne Heche is first seen in orange underwear, then in green underwear. Why? The choice of colors is meaningless, other than to show that Heche's character has bad taste in underwear. The whole movie is like that, color is used just because color is possible. I'm not sure how much thought Hitchcock put into choosing to make PSYCHO in black and white (legend has it that he did it just because it was cheaper at the time), but Van Sant makes no apparent attempt to use color effectively. Indeed, at times, his PSYCHO is so bright and chipper it hardly seems like a suspense drama at all. I don't necessarily think Hitchcock's PSYCHO had to be in black and white to be great, but it is great partly because of the richness and texture of its black and white cinematography. Van Sant's version isn't bad because it is in color, but because he puts no thought into his use of color -- indeed, the film looks better with the color tuned off on the television. The original PSYCHO is often thought of as being a director's film, a work whose success is primarily based on Hitchcock's style. But to see just how much the actors contributed one need only compare the cast and the casting of the two films. Anne Heche has none of the sexuality of Janet Leigh, but worse she plays the part like some spaced-out little flower child. She's neither sexy nor smart. Vince Vaughn finds none of the child-like sweetness of Anthony Perkins' Norman Bates, instead Vaughn plays the part with a giggling creepiness; you distrust his Norman from the start. Heche and Vaughn are just terrible; her performance has no weight, his has no depth. William H. Macy does a credible job as Arbogast the detective, but he has none of the presence of Martin Balsam, who made the character seem indestructible.

Raiders of the Lost Ark  is acclaimed by critics as one of the greatest of all time, and it was very popular, but I personally think that this movie goes a step beyond the original. It has a lot going for it. For one, let's go to the fascinating religion verse science concept that presents itself in here. In the original, the ark appears, and everything is restored back to normal. A consequence-free, direct line from Point A to Point B ending. This one the whole issue is building up inside. The stakes are raised until Indiana Jones himself is presented with the ultimate challenge disreguard everything about archeology and make a leap of faith. Additionally, the father-son relationship is great. The chemistry between the two glamorous stars is amazing. How often does a hero got involved in some kind of father-son dynamic. The complexities of their relationship are displayed through the subtleties in their conversations. They make a great team too. Their interactions are comical and almost-TV like but there's also a lot of noticeable sediment and chemistry. The status relationship is very interesting. As a kid, who obeyed his father without question. I love how Indiana's father is clearly less qualified to fight off the Nazis and is really an obstacle to Indiana, yet the whole father-is-superior complex exists. Sean Connery's character is difenitiely multi-demensional. He's passionate, educated, smart, a little touristy, and has a little touch of that James Bond charisma. Harrison Ford is riveting as always as the likable Indiana Jones. As for the villans, we got the seductive-but-passionate Austrian Archeologist and the professor. Of course, don't forget the equally intriguing and quirky sidekicks which include the clumsy but smart Marcus Brody, and Sallah, who was in Raiders of the Lost Ark. If that isn't enough, how about the whole Nazi angle, and the good vs evil, that's very delicately played into the story. Who could make a better enemy than the Nazis? And I love the tracing Indy from birth to adulthood idea, where parallels are drawn between the Cross of Coronado, his smile, and his hat. The story is cleverly set in different settings, where we really have a sense of segments. It's like a story happens in Venice and a completely different story happens in Saudi Arabia or Austria. Every part of the story line is plausible and well-crafted. And lastly, thumbs up for the action. Not as good as the original movie, but still always clever, always dramatic, and always exciting. The action is clouded with miles of suspense, from the boat chasing scene, to the one with the tanks in the desert, to the scene where they outrun the Nazis in the forest.

It's perhaps the best science-fiction film, in terms of having widespread appeal while still being also appealing to those intrigued by the Time Travel angle. I do maintain, however, that this is at heart, a sci-fi film, maybe not in par with TV shows like Babylon 5 or Star Trek The Next Generation in its complexity, but Doc and his time traveling contraption are really the movie's main draw, and furthermore, I think that the movie has enough scientific exploration within it, that it appeals to those scientifically-minded thinkers within ourselves.At the same time, it mixes the science up with comedy, action, and romance, and practically everything else, and that's why I think this practically everyone who's seen this has liked it.The ensemble gets a lot of mileage, just out of playing with type.

It's more Gary Larson funny, where you look at a picture, and even though you don't physically laugh, inside you can't control the hysteria.Still, I can't help but feel that I would find this film better if I had actually seen some of the classic horror films (in the same way that Blazing Saddles would be better watching westerns, or Airplane! would be better watching the '70s airplane disaster films).True, some of the jokes are few and far in between, but there are so many that still make me laugh.  The best jokes are the ones that keep you laughing, even after you've seen them a hundred times.  The monster is well played by Peter Boyle, and even in a Mel Brooks comedy, you can feel true sympathy for him.  I think this is Brooks' most serious comedy (who says comedies can't be serious?).  Some of the references are a little obscure, but they don't detract from the movie overall.  Good accomplishment.  7 stars.
