Apparently, some people forget how old it is? In the 50's, we could not wait to see this movie, especially once a year on TV. But, seeing it on the screen was awesome. Last week, we took our nephew to see it, and I was amazed at how many people never saw it on a big screen. Guess we were lucky, it only cost 5 cents. Anyway, I have not read all the comments, and most are from out of the country, but if anyone travels thru Chittenango, NY---it was the home of L Frank Baum. His grandson still lives there, and every year, they put on a spectacle. The first time we drove thru, I was amazed, to see all the streets, yes, paved with yellow bricks. The businesses? They all had names like; Dorothy's place, or Oz gift store (I don't actually remember what they are, even thought I'm 45 minutes away.) But again, if you are going thru upstate NY, central NY---it's really pretty, especially this time of year, in the fall. Speaking of falls, they also have a pretty waterfall. My husband and I still watch this movie on TV! And tho the movie was released in August, it has my birthday in June, when the book came out, so it's special to me. Now, if only more movies were like this. Better yet, life! (one of the munchkins looks like a cousin of mine.) 1939 was a great year for movies.

Ford's profile and beautiful skin (eyes, too) are a good match for Rita's. The dance sequence showing a close-up of their faces, during the Carnavale Party, certainly attests to that....This viewing, I missed the first part of the movie and was glad to be enlightened by many who wrote of the opening section of Gilda. If some people see homosexual intent between Ford and Ballin (George Macready), it slipped right past me; would make the plot more intense, though. I just thought those characters recognized they could use one another, without having any other reason, having no regrets about discarding one another.

His hero, neurotic and silent, is an enigmatic person, ready for everything only to save the life of his lover. He is great, even though half the time he is a deformed cripple.

Well, it's from David Lynch, so it's not too surprising. Blue Velvet is set in Lumberton, USA, a small-town where everything seems bright and happy. We meet Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLaghlan), a nice clean-cut college boy who goes back home after his father has a stroke. Tough break, but Jeff ain't seen nothing yet. One day, he's walking in a field and he finds a severed ear. He brings to a police detective, but he also decides to investigate on his own. That's how he gets caught between Dorothy Valiens (Isabella Rosselini), a sensual night-club singer, and Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), a sadistic psychopath. Booth kidnapped Valiens' husband and son, and now he's forcing her to be his sexual slave. Beaumont, both intrigued and horrified by all this, finds himself getting involved sexually with the singer and wanting to help her. Yet he's also dating Sandy (Laura Dern), the detective's daughter, and even more dangerously, Frank doesn't look like he wants anyone getting in the way of his kinky games...Watching Blue Velvet some fifteen years after its release is still a harrowing experience. It feels as out there as ever, and there hasn't been any movie since quite comparing to it, besides David Lynch' further adventures into screwing with your mind, naturally. But what remains so special about Blue Velvet, as opposed to Lynch's overrated Mulholland Drive, is that beyond the oddities, there's a straight-forward narrative, seemingly by-the-numbers mystery to follow. When it sticks to Lumberton's simple suburban life, with neat and naïve Sandy and Jeff holding hands and playing detective, you can't help but think that you're watching a normal movie. The twist is in how these two bright-eyed innocents are pulled into an almost surreal underworld of drugs, violence and deviant sex. Sandy, apple pie catholic girl from head to toes, is utterly appalled, but Jeffrey... Well Jeffrey is attracted by this dark side. He loves his blonde schoolmate (or thinks he does), but when he's with Dorothy it's a whole other ballpark. It feels dirty with her, erotic... Dangerous. The film seems to be about this struggle between puritan decency and perverted impulses, as a boy is divided between the virgin he loves and the whore he desires.Next to Jeffrey, who barely dares to let go of his inhibitions, we have Frank, his mirror opposite. Frank's the guy who's completely detached himself from morals and civilised behaviour. Frank is Man at his worst, devoid of heart and soul and governed solely by rage and lust. Every other word out of his mouth is *&^$!, which he repeats constantly as if it was a mantra. I'll $%#! anything that moves! Then again, even he is not devoid of guilt, as he'll do any sick thing, but he doesn't want people looking at him! Hopper is riveting in this gleefully disturbing part, but I feel it wouldn't quite work as well if Rosselini couldn't hold her own opposite him. The tricky, subversive thing about her character is that while she's technically the victim, you can see that part of her really gets off on it. There's an incredible nakedness to her performance, a sense that unlike Jeff, her Dorothy has reached a point where she just lets go and abandons herself to her impulses.What does it all mean? That's beside the point, but not in the sense that Lynch is being weird just for the sake of it. Blue Velvet is thematically rich and open to different interpretations, but it also works if you take it as a thriller. There's a story being told here, with a beginning, a middle and an end. Scenes and characters serve a purpose, and it pays off. Of course, it could still be seen as a dream or a nightmare or whatnot, but that's speculation. What I'm trying to get at is that the movie works in involving you and taking you on a journey and, though you might feel confused, you won't feel cheated. In short, this does right what Mulholland Drive did wrong. And then there's the constant to Lynch's oeuvre, his unique grasp of film-making and style. From the brilliant opening sequence, which illustrates the dark-side-of-suburbia premise perfectly, to the ambiguous conclusion, which may or may not be earnest in its embracing of love as a remedy to one's hidden destructive tendencies, Blue Velvet is wonderfully crafted. And what to say of the delightful use of music, be it Angelo Badalamenti's creepy score or the jolly 50s pop tunes which provide an ironic counterpoint to the harshness of what's on screen. A candy colored clown they called the Sandman&#133; Sheesh! What bizarre images Roy Orbison's In dreams now brings to mind! In closing, I have to quote Roger Davidson's answer to those who criticise the movie for what it is Of course it's sick - It's supposed to be sick !

When it sticks to Lumberton's simple suburban life, with neat and naïve Sandy and Jeff holding hands and playing detective, you can't help but think that you're watching a normal movie. The twist is in how these two bright-eyed innocents are pulled into an almost surreal underworld of drugs, violence and deviant sex. Sandy, apple pie catholic girl from head to toes, is utterly appalled, but Jeffrey... Well Jeffrey is attracted by this dark side. He loves his blonde schoolmate (or thinks he does), but when he's with Dorothy it's a whole other ballpark. It feels dirty with her, erotic... Dangerous. The film seems to be about this struggle between puritan decency and perverted impulses, as a boy is divided between the virgin he loves and the whore he desires.Next to Jeffrey, who barely dares to let go of his inhibitions, we have Frank, his mirror opposite. Frank's the guy who's completely detached himself from morals and civilised behaviour. Frank is Man at his worst, devoid of heart and soul and governed solely by rage and lust. Every other word out of his mouth is *&^$!, which he repeats constantly as if it was a mantra. I'll $%#! anything that moves! Then again, even he is not devoid of guilt, as he'll do any sick thing, but he doesn't want people looking at him! Hopper is riveting in this gleefully disturbing part, but I feel it wouldn't quite work as well if Rosselini couldn't hold her own opposite him. The tricky, subversive thing about her character is that while she's technically the victim, you can see that part of her really gets off on it. There's an incredible nakedness to her performance, a sense that unlike Jeff, her Dorothy has reached a point where she just lets go and abandons herself to her impulses.What does it all mean? That's beside the point, but not in the sense that Lynch is being weird just for the sake of it. Blue Velvet is thematically rich and open to different interpretations, but it also works if you take it as a thriller. There's a story being told here, with a beginning, a middle and an end. Scenes and characters serve a purpose, and it pays off. Of course, it could still be seen as a dream or a nightmare or whatnot, but that's speculation. What I'm trying to get at is that the movie works in involving you and taking you on a journey and, though you might feel confused, you won't feel cheated. In short, this does right what Mulholland Drive did wrong. And then there's the constant to Lynch's oeuvre, his unique grasp of film-making and style. From the brilliant opening sequence, which illustrates the dark-side-of-suburbia premise perfectly, to the ambiguous conclusion, which may or may not be earnest in its embracing of love as a remedy to one's hidden destructive tendencies, Blue Velvet is wonderfully crafted. And what to say of the delightful use of music, be it Angelo Badalamenti's creepy score or the jolly 50s pop tunes which provide an ironic counterpoint to the harshness of what's on screen. A candy colored clown they called the Sandman&#133; Sheesh! What bizarre images Roy Orbison's In dreams now brings to mind! In closing, I have to quote Roger Davidson's answer to those who criticise the movie for what it is Of course it's sick - It's supposed to be sick !

Well, it's from David Lynch, so it's not too surprising. Blue Velvet is set in Lumberton, USA, a small-town where everything seems bright and happy. We meet Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLaghlan), a nice clean-cut college boy who goes back home after his father has a stroke. Tough break, but Jeff ain't seen nothing yet. One day, he's walking in a field and he finds a severed ear. He brings to a police detective, but he also decides to investigate on his own. That's how he gets caught between Dorothy Valiens (Isabella Rosselini), a sensual night-club singer, and Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), a sadistic psychopath. Booth kidnapped Valiens' husband and son, and now he's forcing her to be his sexual slave. Beaumont, both intrigued and horrified by all this, finds himself getting involved sexually with the singer and wanting to help her. Yet he's also dating Sandy (Laura Dern), the detective's daughter, and even more dangerously, Frank doesn't look like he wants anyone getting in the way of his kinky games...Watching Blue Velvet some fifteen years after its release is still a harrowing experience.

We're not sure who said it; though we did know, it changed on us! This World wide Change or State of Flux, if you will, was very evident in the period between the two World Wars, and in every aspect of life. Political unrest, Pop Cultural Shock, Shifting Mores and a Post 'War to End All Wars' Era all combined to give us a World barely recognizable to the Populice of 30 years or so before.And just think!

That's another thing, The Volsted Act, Mother of Temperence, or Organized Crime? But in any case, we had a great wave of change had overtaken Hollywood, hitting it from every direction. Undoubtedly the greatest shock-wave here came from the Sound Revolution. The Motion Picture had spent the previously 30+ Years in being forged, honed and fine tuned. The result was a Beautiful New Art Form; being a perfect Marriage of Visual Imagery with the Printed Word(Title Cards), with some emotional support of Musical Accompaniment.Now along comes people like Inventor Lee DeForrest and Company. With them they brought processes like Vitaphnoe, Western Electric Recording System, RCA High Fidelity and even Photophone Recording Process. Almost over night, the Studios and Movie Going Public became just about totally obsessed with SOUND, DIALOGUE, ALL-TALKING & ALL-SINGING! Charlie Chaplin was in as good a position as any to meet the challenges of the 'New Era'. His position, wealth and influence had rapidly and steadily grown from the time of his signing his first one year deal with Mack Sennett and his Keystone Studios. The popularity of his 1 and 2 Reeler Comedies brought him successively better financial growth and artistic autonomy over his films. Progressivly improving contracts with Keystone, Essanay, Mutual and First National, led to his owning and operating his own Chaplin Studios and his co-founding the UNITED ARTISTS Corporation.* So Mr. Chaplin had successfully been able to forestall the intrusion of Sound and the Talkies into his film world.

It would surely appear that 'The Little Tramp' succeeded.In THE GREAT DICTATOR, we are shown a metamorphosis on the screen, right before our very eyes. It was done subtly, without the obvious being said, shown or even implied.In the earliest scenes we are brought up to 'the Front' in World War I. It is a fictionalized version , though only lightly so. The 'Enemy' Army is identified as being the Army of Tomainia, but the soldiers, Officers and Enlisted Men, all have a decidedly German look to their Wartime Fashion. A certain allusion is made to Big Bertha's being used by the 'Enemy'.*** At this point we are introduced to 'A Jewish Barber'(Charlie Chaplin) who is on an artillery crew turned into Infantryman. The scenes involving the battle, heavy smoke and an encounter with Allied Forces(could have been either Brits or Yanks, uniforms similar).But as this segment winds down, we are essentially saying good-bye to the Little Tramp and his beautiful, mime filled world of silence\/silents.From then on, Wrtier\/Director Chaplin uses A Case of Mistaken Identity(The Jewish Barber & Dictator Adnoid Hynkel both=Chaplin); by God, it's the old Evil Twin plot!

Along the way, she and they meet all sorts of odd people and creatures, even odder than they themselves are, and almost everyone breaks out into old songs at one point or another, some of them performed in tongues other than English. My favorite involves two pug-ugly boxers in a ring and a dullish young man singing with someone else's superimposed mouth in the front of the ring. I am yet to make it all the way through this sometimes hallucinatory movie, but I shall someday. I understand Elfman's brother, Danny, plays Satan, which I can't wait to see. Interesingly, the sets are right out of a bad high school production, consisting of handpainted cardboard, some cushions and little else. Some sequences are animated in a herky-jerky style. Susan Tyrell is the sixth dimension's angry queen, and Herve Villachaize is the randy king. I don't know who's worse. In fact, the acting by all is abominable, but I suspect this was done on purpose.

It is in effect a series of shorts strung together and connected by the two leads, Chaplin's tramp and Paulette Goddard's gamin. The tale is about how the machine age has taken over industry, throwing men on the streets with no jobs or money to keep their families afloat. In a brilliant stroke of ingenuity, Chaplin decides to scrap the idea of making this a talkie and allows only machines to have a voice. For instance, if the boss needs to bark orders, he does so through a TV screen and if Mr. Billows needs to explain how his feeding machine works, he plays a record containing his full speech. The sound effects are great and the visuals stunning, especially while at the factory. What its essentially a silent film at its core, Modern Times is so much more. A commentary on technology and the dream of making a home for the ones you love, it is also a very sharp comedy that will have you laughing throughout with its physical gags.During the course of his travels, Chaplin's tramp gets mixed up in some impressive set-piece jokes. From the assembly line shenanigans, to the giant gear trappings, to the feeding machine, inadvertently leading a Communist march, a couple stints in jail, a department store disaster, a dilapidated house, and the struggles of waiting tables, he always finds a way to get out of trouble. With all these things happening, the film can appear a tad disjointed, but as his character continues to evolve and the title-cards give us elapsed time, it still holds together as a complete story. A king of physical laughs, Chaplin never holds back either. His nervous breakdown at the plant shows his dedication to the comedy by being unable to shake the arm motion of his job even when he is outdoors and, of course, the rollerskating stunt later on is impressive. I'd be interested to see how that was shot, either composed post-filming to add the drop, or if he really was that close to the edge.You can't deny the man's gift as an artist. How each vignette plays out is inventive and humorous on its journey. Even the moments with the beautiful Goddard are funny in their own right. Her manic facial expressions and piratelike mannerisms while stealing bananas on the docks during her introduction bring some good laughs. Her character is used pretty much as a straightman to Chaplin's lunatic, but she plays the part well. The dream sequence of the two living in a nice house with fruit hanging at every window is priceless and the final scene at the restaurant is a riot. With her trying to help him out in getting a steady job and him mucking it all up to end up needing to sing in gibberish, it is the best part of the movie.While I feel people of all ages can appreciate the film on its own merits&#151;the comedy is broad and kids will enjoy the stunts and bodily harm stuff&#151;it does contain some adult situations. Besides the Communist march mentioned previously, there is a short scene with Chaplin drunk along with a more lengthy part with him after imbibing some nose powder. It is never actually labeled as being drugs and the scene could be effective still without knowing what the powder is, so one should not use it as the sole reason to not show it to children. Modern Times is a classic on many levels and has proved so by standing the test of time for seventy years thus far.

To sneak a microchip past security at the airport, they hide the chip in a remote control car, and put it in a bag, but that bag matches a label on an old woman's bag and she mistakenly takes the wrong bag...to Chicago. the toy car ends up in possession of Alex, who gets the chicken pox. so while he stays at home, the terrorists have found out what neighborhood the toy car is in, and need to break into each home to find the car, and Alex needs to find out why they need the car.people think this movie was a bad idea, well, in some ways it is. Alex is using hi-tech gear, but it's back to the old school with the booby traps. Alex uses a trunk of books, adhesive glue, plaster, and black paint from a spray can.i give it 8\/10.

","genre":"Comedy, Crime, Family"},{"date":"22 September 2007","score":"","review":" Fargo is the Coen brother's film of a salesman in Fargo, North Dakota that hires two men to kidnap his wife for financial gain and a subsequent police investigation. The story is said to be based on true events with the stipulation that the characterizations are exaggerated for comical effect. The film has an eclectic mix of drama, crime, humor and black humor. The film is well-shot and has an effective score.The film has solid performances. William H. Macy creates a compelling character as the desperate salesman Jerry Lundegaard. Carl Showalter and Gaear Grimsrud are interesting as the quirky yet dangerous as the kidnappers. Frances McDormand also has a notable turn as the no-nonsense and practical yet simple Marge Gunderson.The story starts off well and the crime story generally retained my interest. However, I found that the script got diverted at a number of points and was less effective than it could have been. A prime example of this was the scenes related to the character of Mike, which were unnecessary and distracted from the main story. The film's satire of how trite people can be is clever at points, but becomes tedious with repetition. However, Chief Gunderson's speech toward the end of the film was well-written. Unfortunately I didn't find the quality of Fargo to be up to its reputation despite its positive points.

Kurt Russell is perfect for the title role. His character is a symbol of how society treats those it deems no longer useful, how cruel society can be, how people are treated like mere commodities, to be thrown away when deemed obsolete. This movie provides a chilling portrayal of how people can be reduced to the level of robots, how they can be conditioned to commit the vilest acts under the pretense of obeying orders and what happens when people are taught to obey every oder, no matter how outrageous, without question. Mr. Russell's character says little but when he does speak, his words carry great meaning. This is one movie where the script does not get in the way of the story, which is unique. This is an excellent movie that does not rely solely on special effects but actually explores questions relating to war, violence and the relationship of the individual to society.
