Tarsem Singh has provided us with a great visual movie. Not that it's just based on visuals. While the effects are amazing, the story holds up too. Some people have complained that this is just another serial killer movie, which is entirely not true, in my opinion. Yes, the villain, Carl Stargher, is a serial killer, but the movie makes us look at him, not so much as a terrible evil person, but as a very sick man who needs help. It makes us feel sorry for him, while still being disgusted by the things he does.That's another thing, this movie is not for the faint of heart. It's rated R, and it earned that rating. In addition to the nudity, the violence in the film is especially gory, and at many times is utterly disgusting. I don't mean that in a bad way, but the movie isn't for everyone. If you can handle it, then it doesn't take away from the film, because it's done in an artful way.The only weak spot in the film, I thought, was the acting of Jennifer Lopez. While not absolutely horrible, there were some spots where she seemed a little wooden, and there are many actresses who could have played the role better. It also could've been worse though. That said, the rest of the acting is great. Vince Vaughn was impressive, and Vincent D'Onofrio was especially good as Carl Stargher. He plays Stargher like a man who knows what he's doing is terrible, but can't stop himself. Like I said before, you almost feel sorry for him. Jake Thomas is also good as the young Stargher.All in all, this is a great movie. It certainly will not appeal to everyone, and if you don't think you can handle the levels of twisted violence, I wouldn't recommend it. However, if you don't mind that, you will find a movie with a great, original plot, and absolutely stunning special effects. The Cell is one of the most creative films I have ever had the pleasure of seeing.Rating 9\/10 (1 point off for Lopez) ","genre":null},{"date":"19 August 2000","score":"","review":"  The Cell has to be one of the most unique movies to come out in a long time.

Congo is a movie so ridiculous, so stupid, so idiotic, and so dumb that I found myself cracking up during many scenes. The plot of Congo is about an expedition that goes into the jungles of Africa who come face-to-face with killer gorillas. Since it's a waste of my time to explain the rest of the goofy plot, I just get down to what's good and bad about Congo. Here's the good stuff. As far as the cast goes, there are only two good performances turned in by Laura Linney as the communications expert looking for her fiance who's disappeared in the African jungle and Ernie Hudson as the group's tour guide. Plus, some of the African scenery looks beautiful with the cinematographer of E.T. (Allen Daviau) doing the honors here. Now here's the bad stuff (and there's alot of it). The worst acting honors for Congo go to Tim Curry who gives one of the most laughable film performances of all-time. Curry, speaking with a bad foreign accent, plays a Romanian fortune hunter obsessed with finding a long lost city that Hudson believes does not exist. Another silly character in the film is Amy the talking gorilla, who when having a special speaking device on talks with a schoolgirl voice that's sounds absolutely ridiculous. The screenplay by John Patrick Shanley (based on Michael Crichton's novel) has alot of preposterous dialogue. And it's hard to imagine that Frank Marshall directed this. Marshall, who's first directing effort was the very good horror\/comedy Arachnophobia, is a protege of Steven Spielberg.

Marshall as worked with Spielberg on some of the biggest box-office hits of all-time (he produced the Indiana Jones trilogy) and scored a huge box-office hit last year on his own as co-producer (with Kennedy) of The Sixth Sense.

I have come to conclude that European films rely primarily on substance (with the exception of Fellini, who went for style), whereas American filmmakers will push style over substance almost all the time. Very rarely does a filmmaker manage to achieve a harmonious balance of style and substance. One good example is the American director George Lucas (STAR WARS). Another example is the American (though British by birth) director Alfred Hitchcock (VERTIGO).VERTIGO was not my first Hitchcock film. I had previously seen I CONFESS, which really didn't affect me that much (probably because it was in black and white, and I think most films are much more dramatically intense in color). I sat down to watch VERTIGO not knowing what to expect. I understood part of the plot, if not all of it. Therefore, I was surprised by what I didn't understand as well as delighted by what I did understand.I enjoyed the film. It is a journey into the neurotic mind of John Ferguson (James Stewart), a San Francisco detective who suffers from a chronic fear of heights. He retires from the police force, only to be called upon by an old friend to undertake one last case. This case concerns the friend's wife (Kim Novak), who is believed to be insane. John begins to shadow his quarry through San Francisco, gradually becoming obsessed with her. And that's just the beginning...I mentioned earlier that VERTIGO is a blend of style and substance, and Hitchcock truly does artfully mix the two into a coherent whole. VERTIGO cannot be pigeonholed, being equal parts detective story, romance, and psychological thriller. The movie is slow at times (which is actually quite crucial to the plot), but on other occasions it explodes with blasts of the colorful and the avant-garde. The most striking of these is a bizarre dream sequence that becomes completely abstract and is totally at odds with anything else in the film. And then, of course, there is Hitchcock's innovative method for capturing the vertigo effect - backing the camera away from the action while at the same time deploying the zoom lens.But the movie's real strengths lie in its performers. Jimmy Stewart displays his excellent range by puncturing his George Bailey stereotype from IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and running in the opposite direction, portraying a fey character who is both sympathetic and frightening. The real star, however, is Kim Novak. I have never seen her in any other movie, but I am convinced of her talent just from watching this one. In effect, she plays herself - an actress who can become anyone in order to confuse and torment. She is like a normal woman at some points, and then at other times she becomes strangely inhuman - silent and enigmatic. In fact, in this two-hour movie Kim Novak does not actually speak until the film is one-third over.VERTIGO was a powerful experience for me. It did not actually scare me (as PSYCHO probably would), but it did disturb me a bit and made me realize how emotionally unstable a lot of seemingly complacent human beings are. It is, first and foremost, a chilling thriller, and the love story is actually a wonderful bonus. Plus, it depicts the one-of-a-kind beauty of the vistas of San Francisco the way no other movie ever has. I give VERTIGO three and a half stars (only because it just wasn't every bit as powerful as it could have been). It truly deserves its place among the greatest films of all time.

The only other Godzilla film I've ever seen is the 1998 Hollywood version (and I don't care what anyone thinks, I still like that one).Anyway, Godzilla 2000 is the first of the original Godzilla films since 1995's Godzilla Vs. Destoroyah and the first to be realeased in North American cinemas since Godzilla 1985 The Legend is Reborn. So what did I, an almost virgin to the Godzilla series think? Well...First, a little about the film. Godzilla returns, slightly smaller (150 feet instead of 400) to attempt another raid on Tokyo. Meanwhile, there are these scientists who unearth a mysterous stone stratum underwater only to find out that its an alien space craft that's been in suspended animation for 16 million years (Cecil B. DeMille is spinning in his grave). Soon after that, the aliens pursue Godzilla cuz the big guy has some sort of gene that can help them populate Earth. So naturally, its up to Godzilla to once again play the unlikely hero and save the world.If I had any beefs about this film, its that it spends way too much time on the alien space craft, and too little time on Godzilla. After all, the film is called GODZILLA 2000! I guess the director just wanted to create some suspense. Storywise, this movie could have been better, but does anybody really see a Godzilla movie (or ANY monster movie for that matter) for its story and acting? Hell no! They see it to watch Godzilla wipe his feet on Tokyo (or New York if you're counting the 1998 film WHICH I STILL LIKE!!!!).As for the acting, its hard to tell what the original acting was like since the film had to be dubbed for its North American realese, so I can't really fairly comment.

The only other Godzilla film I've ever seen is the 1998 Hollywood version (and I don't care what anyone thinks, I still like that one).Anyway, Godzilla 2000 is the first of the original Godzilla films since 1995's Godzilla Vs. Destoroyah and the first to be realeased in North American cinemas since Godzilla 1985 The Legend is Reborn. So what did I, an almost virgin to the Godzilla series think? Well...First, a little about the film. Godzilla returns, slightly smaller (150 feet instead of 400) to attempt another raid on Tokyo. Meanwhile, there are these scientists who unearth a mysterous stone stratum underwater only to find out that its an alien space craft that's been in suspended animation for 16 million years (Cecil B. DeMille is spinning in his grave). Soon after that, the aliens pursue Godzilla cuz the big guy has some sort of gene that can help them populate Earth. So naturally, its up to Godzilla to once again play the unlikely hero and save the world.If I had any beefs about this film, its that it spends way too much time on the alien space craft, and too little time on Godzilla. After all, the film is called GODZILLA 2000! I guess the director just wanted to create some suspense. Storywise, this movie could have been better, but does anybody really see a Godzilla movie (or ANY monster movie for that matter) for its story and acting? Hell no! They see it to watch Godzilla wipe his feet on Tokyo (or New York if you're counting the 1998 film WHICH I STILL LIKE!!!!).As for the acting, its hard to tell what the original acting was like since the film had to be dubbed for its North American realese, so I can't really fairly comment.

To start off with, the visuals were amazing. Very well-done and well designed and put to very good use. I read somewhere that someone thought all the visuals were 'pretentious'. Whatever that means. It's a very imaginary film. And I think of this as a film. There are certain movies that I regard as 'movies' and not 'films', and the highest, most well-done cinematic experiences rich in certain details are 'films'. This is a 'film' in many senses. I read the script a while back and new that it was intensely original (no matter what the ignoramous critics may say) and that the person who wrote it possessed a love and knowledge of all things of the art and mind. The Cell deals with the issues of the mind combined with art. And the way different art reflects different states of mind. Brilliant. My favorite part would probably have to be when Vince Vaughn (footnote, he has terrible bags under his eyes, but anyway..) first goes into the mind of Carl Stargher. He wakes up in a pond and sees three women shrouded in black and sitting staring up at the sky reminiscent of an Egyptian painting. At least to me. And they each turn to him simultaneously and whisper something like Have you seen my son? Spooky and very imaginative. I like the whole idea of his victims populating his mental universe. Of course they would; they're on his conscience and subconscience, either out of guilt or simple memory. And they've become helpless prisoners and victims of his world forever, and his latest victim was destined for that unless they could save her. I won't spoil the ending here, but I have to say about one aspect of the film's ending Jennifer Lopez returns to Carl's mind as the Virgin Mary in a very sweet and gentle scene and cleanses young Carl before he dies. In this film, they don't just find the serial killer and kill him, they cleanse him. (And I'm not religious or anything, but I still found that very profound and wise.) Roger Ebert said he felt this is one of the best films of the year because you really care about the characters. He's absolutely right. And it's one of the best films of the year for  every other reason. Kudos to Eiko Ishioka, costume designer. She won an Academy Award for her work on Bram Stoker's Dracula.
