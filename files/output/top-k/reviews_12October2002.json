Pay It Forward, for mine, does exactly that. It shows what one favour can do, for this incredibly selfish and unforgiving world. Sure this movie is a bit of a &#145;tear-jerker', but that only enhances it all the more. This is the bittersweet and uplifting tale that was written by novelist Catherine Ryan Hyde.Just imagine. You do a favour that really helps someone and you tell him or her not to pay it back but to pay it forward to three other people who, in turn, each pay it forward to three more &#150; and on and on into a global outpouring of kindness and decency. Impossible? That is one word that junior high school student Trevor McKinney will not accept. How much impact can one heartfelt idea have?Director, Mimi Leder, transformed a very simple story into a good movie. I can understand that some people might not have liked the direction that she took her audience on, but for me it was still of great enjoyment. The story that she was given did help her in my opinion, but other people could say it hurt her and the movie. I like the very simple setting that Leder gave us. To base the movie around a school project is clever, but to then make it become a very complex and touching story was great. There is some extremely good talent on show in this movie. Haley Joel Osment ceases to amaze me. He is truly a star. Take into consideration his mind-blowing performance in the Sixth Sense, I was sure that he could not do any better than that. While he might not achieve the same heights in this movie, I enjoyed the role he performs. He is the perfect person to &#145;make a difference' in the world. The adults in this film were also terrific. I like the work of Kevin Spacey. He was the very complex teacher, but wounded Eugene Simonet. I like how he and Trevor have a very special understanding. I have been keen to follow Spacey since his Academy award-winning role in &#145;American Beauty'. I will continue to track him carefully. Helen Hunt is a very attractive actress, who plays Trevor's mother Arlene. She is an alcoholic, who is struggling to juggle the responsibilities of two jobs and be a mother. I found her role to very genuine. Yet somehow her son makes her realise that if she does not wake up to herself, she will remain in a lot of trouble. The way that Haley, interacts with both Spacey and Hunt onscreen is very special. There are many touching and poignant scenes in `Pay it Forward'. The start is very ingenious, as that is where we see this chain reaction start. I also like the first scene with Spacey and how he gives his Social Studies class there first assignment on the blackboard Think of an idea that could change the world. One of the more important scenes in this movie is when we Iearn how Mr. Simonet was burned and scarred, as it really had a big effect on me. There are also many scenes that show Trevor doing both his assignment and helping to really change the world. These are all priceless from Osment. Also seeing Trevor's mother tackling her alcohol addiction are tremendous, as one scene in particular between Arlene and Trevor makes her wake up and take note that she really does have a problem. I am not going to give away the ending, but from where I viewed it, I think it is fitting to say the least. This film for me has a very biblical feeling attached to it. Although it might not be intentional, I am glad a movie like this does so. As a Christian and a believer in the Christian ethos, the message &#145;Pay it forward' gives, is not unlike that of Jesus Christ. He was of the same opinion that people should not pay back a favour, but pay it forward, so that only good things can happen in the world. If we all in some way follow this very simple message, then the world can change and be a better place for us all.In conclusion, we can all learn a valuable lesson from this movie.

","genre":"Documentary, Music"},{"date":"12 October 2002","score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":"  I didn't like this movie; it was way too long, the editing was terrible (how many times can we see Nicholson fishing), and the overly present music badly chosen.  I found Nicholson good though.  Without going through the whole movie, many question were left unanswered (***SPOILERS*** 1) The dramatic début of the movie, with the 5 minute-long discussion that ends up with Nicholson's Pledge, seem to indicate that the movie will be about a cop trying to find a child-killer.  The next part of the movie, a ten-minute-long interview (way too long, by the way) with a first suspect seem to follow in that direction also. 2) The scene with the child-therapist seem to add a twist when a chain-smoking, sweating Nicholson looks like the above-mentionned killer.  Key to this scene is when the therapist asks him if he is still sexually active.  Why this question ?  Probably  because she suspects his obsession with young little girls being raped is unusual.  Since she is a therapist, we should pay attention to this scene. (Unless the movie doesn't really have a storyline, which is probable). 3) Nicholson falling in love with a woman which is not particularly pretty, but has a cute little blonde girl of almost 8 years old.  During the movie, I felt as if Nicholson fell in love with the mother because of her daughter.  A scene in particular, at the beginning of their relationship, highly insinuates that Nicholson is flirting with the little girl.  (But maybe this scene is only to cause confusion). 4)  Nicholson is seen drinking at the beginning of the movie, and the officer says he is a drunk.  Is he ?  We did not see him drinking during the whole movie (except for the beginning and the end). 5)  We see Nicholson looking suspiciously at just about anybody.  We get the idea that the officer suffers from an obsessive paranoia of some sort. 6)  The whole story about a giant, a large man offering candy to attract little girls is probably a story that nourishes Nicholson's own fantasy world.  Nicholson attaches so much importance on that whole narrative, that we understand that he is obsessed  by big man seducing little girls with chocolate. 7)   He litteraly sets up a fantasy scene where his little blonde girl is attacked by the real killer.  No parent in the world would ever do such a crazy thing, unless, of course, he finally wants to see it happen.All these put together, the movie seems to suggest that officer Black (Nicholson) is a pedophile who gets a libidinal kick out of pursuing cases involving little blonde girls being raped.  He can then indulge in his fantasy without actually doing it (highly suspicious is here the scene where he steals from another police officer a picture of a 8 year old victim).  Black then falls in love with the killer's next victim (which he probably chose because she fits the victims profile, but that part of the movie is still really far fetched, talk about luck), gets a kick at watching all day long this cute little potential victim, trying to imagine all the big men that could sexually molest her, and then goes crazy when the fantasy scene doesn't occur. If this conclusion is true, they probably diluted it to make it acceptable by adding a non-sensical beginning (abd all these fishing shots).  If I'm all wrong, then the movie doesn't really make sense.

(Unless the movie doesn't really have a storyline, which is probable). 3) Nicholson falling in love with a woman which is not particularly pretty, but has a cute little blonde girl of almost 8 years old.  During the movie, I felt as if Nicholson fell in love with the mother because of her daughter.  A scene in particular, at the beginning of their relationship, highly insinuates that Nicholson is flirting with the little girl.  (But maybe this scene is only to cause confusion). 4)  Nicholson is seen drinking at the beginning of the movie, and the officer says he is a drunk.  Is he ?  We did not see him drinking during the whole movie (except for the beginning and the end). 5)  We see Nicholson looking suspiciously at just about anybody.  We get the idea that the officer suffers from an obsessive paranoia of some sort. 6)  The whole story about a giant, a large man offering candy to attract little girls is probably a story that nourishes Nicholson's own fantasy world.  Nicholson attaches so much importance on that whole narrative, that we understand that he is obsessed  by big man seducing little girls with chocolate. 7)   He litteraly sets up a fantasy scene where his little blonde girl is attacked by the real killer.  No parent in the world would ever do such a crazy thing, unless, of course, he finally wants to see it happen.All these put together, the movie seems to suggest that officer Black (Nicholson) is a pedophile who gets a libidinal kick out of pursuing cases involving little blonde girls being raped.  He can then indulge in his fantasy without actually doing it (highly suspicious is here the scene where he steals from another police officer a picture of a 8 year old victim).  Black then falls in love with the killer's next victim (which he probably chose because she fits the victims profile, but that part of the movie is still really far fetched, talk about luck), gets a kick at watching all day long this cute little potential victim, trying to imagine all the big men that could sexually molest her, and then goes crazy when the fantasy scene doesn't occur. If this conclusion is true, they probably diluted it to make it acceptable by adding a non-sensical beginning (abd all these fishing shots).  If I'm all wrong, then the movie doesn't really make sense.

I found Nicholson good though.  Without going through the whole movie, many question were left unanswered (***SPOILERS*** 1) The dramatic début of the movie, with the 5 minute-long discussion that ends up with Nicholson's Pledge, seem to indicate that the movie will be about a cop trying to find a child-killer.  The next part of the movie, a ten-minute-long interview (way too long, by the way) with a first suspect seem to follow in that direction also. 2) The scene with the child-therapist seem to add a twist when a chain-smoking, sweating Nicholson looks like the above-mentionned killer.

If anyone should be at the forefront, showing what terrorism can do, then it should be him. It was no surprise, that this film was held back for release, after the events of September 11, in New York. But a year on from that tragic event, this film helps to show what it would have been like to be a part of 9\/11, as this movie is not unlike the real event that we all saw take place.Running late to meet his wife and young son at a downtown high-rise, Fire-fighter Gordy Brewer witnesses a catastrophic bomb blast kill his family before his eyes. The explosion is credited to `The Wolf', an infamous rebel leader in Colombia's decades-long civil war. The intended targets were members of the Colombian consulate and American intelligence agents. Gordy's wife and child are considered `Collateral damage', innocent people who lost their lives for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. When the US investigation into the Wolf's whereabouts stalls, Gordy realises that bringing the terrorist to justice is no longer a priority to anyone but himself. This movie has many facets that I liked. I enjoyed the danger that is always present in the story. Sure there are some victims in the movie, but it makes for very interesting viewing. I am certain that the screenwriters for the film could not have imagined ever resembling a story, such as that of September 11. While it might disturb some people from even viewing the film, it made me want to watch it all the more. The men who wrote it were Ronald Roose and David Griffiths.  The direction that Collateral Damage took was also good in my opinion. The director allows us to see a man suffer a tragic loss, be a very down to earth hero, in addition to being the man who wants to bring his family's killer to justice and try to help save his county in the process. Having Gordy as a fireman, and showing him saving lives was an ingenious move from director Andrew Davis. The pace this film has is good, as it never stays still for too long. I also found the locations that were used for the story, changing between America and Columbia, to be a good mix from Davis. What's more, the landscape used for the Columbian part of the film was excellent.Arnie is a big action star, and some people might say he is one dimensional in the movies that he performs in. However his role in this film, for me shows that at least he can act. He is a very &#145;gentle giant' of sorts in Collateral Damage. I guess seeing your family killed in a bomb blast would have that effect on a person. Gordy's character is a very smart one, as he uses all of his abilities to help him at all times. You genuinely feel for Gordy, as he is one man that does not deserve what he has gotten out of life. The back up cast for Schwarzenegger is of the finest quality. While some people will not like the evil character of &#145;The Worm', I like who performed Claudio, that being Cliff Curtis. His character has ice in his veins and will stop at nothing to bring the certain American ideals to their knees. The role that surprised me the most from &#145;Collateral Damage' was that of Selena. Italian born Francesca Neri played her very well. When you finally think you can trust a person, out of the blue comes the one person you should never trusted.

Cornelia, haughty and rude, annoys Godfrey, and he volunteers to help the decidely loopy Irene beat her sister for once. Before long, Irene wants Godfrey as her 'protege', following in the footsteps of her zany mother Angelica (Alice Brady) who seems to have adopted the odd little Russian man Carlo (Mischa Auer). It isn't long, either, before Irene falls hard for Godfrey and tries her best, from faking engagements to faking fainting spells, to win him over. But Godfrey has his own secrets and reasons for working at the Bullock household. (As gleefully pointed out by Molly the maid, played by Jean Dixon, no *ordinary* butler lasts beyond their first encounter with the extremely eccentric female Bullocks.) It is through Godfrey's reevaluation of his own true identity, and the Bullocks' subsequent discovery of this identity, that every character in the film learns a little something about themselves and about life.MY MAN GODFREY has just about as screwball a cast of characters as it can get after all, the Bullock girls (consisting of a ditzy matriach who sees pixies when she has a hangover and a daughter who rides horses up the front steps and parks them in the library!) certainly do their very best to keep one constantly bemused. The actresses all do very well in their roles--Brady tosses off manic giggles as Madame Bullock so convincingly you wonder if she really *is* like that in real life. She handles the character's blithe irrelevance expertly, even as Mrs Bullock sees hangover-induced pixies, asks her pet Carlo to play gorilla to cheer her daughter up, and spouts non sequiturs like she was born to do so. Gail Patrick is also worthy of mention as the spoilt brat Cornelia, who sets out to make Godfrey's life as difficult as she can because he pushed her into an ash pile when they first met, and even as butler, he still refuses to pander to her every whim. Patrick really does a grand job playing the bitch (see STAGE DOOR for another example), but doesn't completely alienate the audience--quite a feat considering what she does with her pearl necklace in order to get Godfrey fired...!The leads are on top form as well. In approaching the role of Irene with no reservations whatsoever, Carole Lombard gives an excellent portrayal of this kooky heiress who not only doggedly pursues Godfrey once she discovers he's actually single and *doesn't* have five children, but also drifts around striking tragic poses learnt at drama school to get Godfrey's attention when she *thinks* he's married with kids. Lombard doesn't try to live up to any kind of glamorous image; she just *goes* for it all, crying, fainting, jumping around the room and all over the bed because Godfrey sticking her in the shower somehow proves he 'loves' her... She has no problem with either looking or acting foolish, and this works entirely in her favour, as well as that of her character's. Good as she is, however, she can't quite stop MY MAN GODFREY from being a consummate William Powell film. Powell is absolutely fantastic even though he doesn't quite carry off the street bum look (his natural elegance struggles through, and even that's probably part of the role since Godfrey isn't really who he appears to be), his Godfrey is wry, charming and witty. No one plays the lucid drunk better than Powell, and this film, along with THE THIN MAN series, acts as the best evidence of that. He handles his character's self-imposed detachment from the Lombard character with aplomb, playing Godfrey as simultaneously bemused and charmed. Small wonder that the film picked up acting nominations in all four categories (male and female lead and supporting) at the Academy Awards--the cast of MY MAN GODFREY is really excellent, and they're ably supported by the script and assured direction of Gregory La Cava. All in all, it's a great film certainly one of the best romantic comedies I've seen, though possibly not the best screwball (that honour still belongs to BRINGING UP BABY, which certainly recognises its debt to MY MAN GODFREY, at least insofar as Katharine Hepburn brings a lot of Lombard's inflection and lilt into her own performance). It's the kind of film you won't see emerging from Hollywood anymore, unless it's a remake (heaven forbid), and definitely one whose characters really need to be seen to be believed. The ending of the film is a bit rushed (though bizarrely appropriate!), and it certainly isn't perfect, but other than that, MY MAN GODFREY is first-class film-making with classy performances... and that's as good a reason as any to watch it.

Well first of all, the Ewoks are probably more 'child-like' than Jar Jar, this film is set in a 'dry' time, it is more serious, therefore, there is no e.g. Han Solo character.I personally do not watch Star Wars films for the great acting and dialogue etc, although I think they are fine in this film, but many people dislike both the acting and dialogue.  If you want to see good acting and dialogue, go to the Theatre, or watch another film, if u want to see amazing special effects along with intense scenes, then watch 'The Phantom Menace'.So if you watch this film with the above in mind, you should enjoy it. When this film was made, it was the Star Wars film with the most lightsabre action in it, the Podrace scene is excellent, and it has the best lightsabre battle in the Star Wars saga.Although I love this film, I still believe that 'The Empire Strikes Back', 'Return of the Jedi' and 'Attack of the Clones' are superior to it.  So although in my opinion it is not the weakest of the saga, it is also not the best.

Taking the film-within-a-film concept an extra step, it tells the story of Paul, a young filmmaker in 1969 Paris who is working on both a sci-fi schlockfest (director Roman Coppola's homage to Mario Bava's Danger Diabolik) and a personal art film.  As he tries to make something honest with his art film, he simultaneously tries to figure out an ending for the SF movie.CQ is rather episodic, moving freely between events in Paul's reality and scenes within his two in-progress films.  I can't help but think of a line from the movie, wherein Paul is told to connect things, so that the audience feels something.  Beyond a simplistic theme of doubles (a comment by Paul's father leads to an ending for the SF film), there is nothing deeply connecting the scenes presented to the audience.  The director's commentary track failed to provide any insight here, mentioning things like this is my Fellini homage scene and my friend's grandmother told him this story about Dragonflies, and I thought it was neat so I put it in.  Coppola is treating us to his personal relationship with film, without really giving us anything to think about. (Another example from the commentary comes from a scene where Paul opens a letter to reveal a French driver's license, which is not clearly visible, at least on a 31 TV screen.  Although the license is implied by an otherwise unconnected sideplot from much earlier in the movie, I didn't realize what it was.  Coppola's comment on this is along the lines of People told me that nobody would know it's a driver's license, but I thought it was pretty obvious, so I left it.  This pretty much sums up his attitude towards the audience.)All that said, there is entertainment to be had watching CQ.  Billy Zane nearly steals the show with his small role, and Jason Schwartzman is good for a few laughs as well.  The acting is generally very good, including model Angela Lindvahl as Valentine, the star of the sci-fi movie.  Jeremy Davies manages to convey Paul's narcissism without making him unlikeable (at least to viewers who understand the relationship of the artistically driven to their work), which is a fine tightrope to walk.In the end, Roman Coppola has given us an entertaining film, but one which is less thoughtful from the audience's viewpoint than he likely intended.

What seems to be a happy family is then turned inside out when the father receives a vision from God one night. He awakens his boys to tell them that an angel told him that he has been chosen to rid the world of demons who are in the form of humans. If it sounds like a slasher flick it's not, but more a study of how one mans fascination can prove more dangerous than that of an insane person. Instead of the usually buckets of gore, something very original is shown. Whenever someone is about to get hacked up the camera cuts away and instead, shows the expressions on the faces of those witnessing these acts of violence, not only heightening the suspense but giving the film a greater impact. We are shown that there are two sides to everything. With loves comes hate, with life comes death and with happiness comes fear. We just aren't aware of what lurks beneath the surface because we as humans never really felt the need to, but this film begs to answer the question, what if one person decided to look beneath the surface, what would he find? The film is also original because it pits our character against the greatest antagonist known to man. Not it's not God and it can't be the father because he is not a criminal he is just a loving father fulfilling his destiny, but rather the mere human mind, it is enough to turn a rose garden from a playground to a burial ground, all based on the decisions we as individuals make and in the end it is not God who makes those decisions for us he only guides us. God doesn't put the axe in your hand, he just tells you how you should use it. Mahatma Gandhi once said you must be the change you want to see in the world. A man goes beneath the surface and doesn't like what he sees. Does this justify his actions? Does killing to save the world really make him any better than the demons he is hunting? That's the beauty of the film, it's not about some huge plot twists of surprise ending, all that is for entertainment sake, this film is about the questions it leaves you asking yourself after the credits role. We spend the entire film flashing back between 1979 and the present. In the present we see Matthew McConaughey sitting in a police station telling his story of what happened to his family when he was a child. There are many clues hidden along the way like when the father tells his son I am your father and you will do as I say. You will probably think you have the whole thing figured out by the half way mark but you won't because it seems that those clues were only used to hide the real clues to unlock the secret of the film. To tell you the truth, I'm still not exactly sure if I know e4xactly what happened in the end, repeated viewings will probably be required. Both McConaughey and Paxton are at their best and Paxton is also a gifted director, he moves everything at such a slow pace that all the suspense seemed even more heightened than it already is. Everyone who sees this film will get something different from it due to the fact that most of it is left up to the imagination. The is very frightening and, at times, hard to watch. You could have a film filled with every hockey mask wearing, hatchet wielding, pin headed freak and it still wouldn't measure up to the horrors of one mans mind, making this one of the most original and riveting horror films top come around in a long while.

The film was shot on a low budget, and many of the crew, namely actors Jack Nicholson and Danny DeVito, and director, Tim Burton, agreed to make the film as an homage to the TOPS Bubblegum wrapper comic series.The film works because it doesn't present itself as being more than what it is a parody of '50's B-films.  Throughout the film, obvious references to those B-film classics, like _The Day the Earth Stood Still_ and _This Island Earth_, are present.  When the Martians land in Nevada (alleged home of Area 54), Burton reminds us of those famous scenes in which the U. S. army battles the aliens with crude artillery, matched against the sophisticated ray guns of their adversaries.  Because the sci-fi B-films of the '50's were infused with anxiety, precipitated by the McCarthy era, Burton plays upon this context when the Martians visit Congress and destroy every senator and representative in attendance (We still have 2 out of 3 branches of government working for us, President Nicholson reminds his fellow Americans).  Aside from the riotous parodying which takes place, the film draws upon a cast of Oscar-nominated talent.  However, realizing their true motivation for such a film as _Mars Attacks!_, Oscar nominees Glenn Close, Annette Bening, and Jack Nicholson camp it up.  Immediately, an audience member acknowledges that these actors know the Academy will not reward them for their efforts in this film.  However, an informed audience member would see that their acting, meant to be campy and hammed up, is at the heart of their performances.  Given the fact that these are award-winning actors acting poorly, any viewer would have to applaud the performances as sheer talent-less.I give this film 9 out of 10 points.  While not a great film, by any stretch of the imagination, it is a fun film which fulfills its purpose.  Nicholson, DeVito, and Burton can be pleased with the results of their desire to bring the famous TOPS story to the screen.  In an age in which Hollywood either promotes lavishly expensive, high-tech scripts or promotes artistic plot-driven storylines, _Mars Attacks!_ finds its own place and does not put on the facade of being something other than it is, an homage and revival of the classic '50's sci-fi B-film.

There are over twenty-six hundred comments at IMDb and another twenty-five hundred at Amazon. There even seems to be some block reviewing from young Christian groups enthusiastically pointing out all the parallels to Christ's life Neo, The One, Trinity, saving humankind, and being lifted up to heaven, etc. I would add that directors Andy and Larry Wachowski touched some other religious bases as well. Note that Gloria Foster is Oracle (Greek mythology), that Lawrence Fishburne is Morpheus (of the Underworld) and that Joe Pantoliano is Mr. Reagan (a little secular allusion here). The band of heroes are also referred to as freedom fighters to recall our ex-prez's words. (But never mind.)The main thing to understand is that this is one very popular and very arresting movie, the sort of thing Hollywood producers love; in fact all of Hollywood loves The Matrix because it gave work to so many. Scrolling the credits takes longer than your mother's phone good-bye. The Matrix is an industry in itself, something like Star Wars and Rambo.But is the movie any good?Well, it's not much on video. The DVD is undoubtedly an improvement, and on the silver screen it might lean you back in your seat. The cinematography, sound and special effects are first rate.But I mean philosophically speaking?I think we can get a hint from a review that began (and I quote) Why can't all movies be this good? -A 12-year-old viewer. Indeed, this is the question all those marketing minds in Hollywood are asking. The true blockbuster action\/adventure\/sci-fi movie aims at a male viewer of about 18. Ideally the range would include 12-year-olds to thirtysomethings. Any philosophy beyond that mental age is burdensome.So you don't think it is a philosophically interesting movie?Actually I do. I just don't think it's original. I mean Plato's cave allegory is over two thousand years old. And let's not forget The Wizard of Oz (1939) or even The Truman Show (1998). Any science fiction buff can point to half a dozen precursors.Isn't that stretching it a bit?Okay, how about this short story from half a century or so ago called something like The Perm-Machine. Everybody in the future society is working their nine-to-five tails off for a TEMP--that is, for a few hours in the box hooked up to the feelie machine complete with 3D screen, surround sound and electrodes attached to your every neuron so that the complete, thrilling, all senses experience of the greatest adventures in life are theirs, including sex, drugs, heart-pounding action and other sensual pleasures. But what everybody really wanted was a PERM, which would place them in the box permanently hooked up to the electrodes and intravenous drips, etc. for the rest of their lives, a kind of virtual reality heaven on earth.What about the acting?Forget the acting. It was okay. Consider this instead we are going to become software. There isn't going to be any warfare between man and machine with the human spirit triumphant. Instead, we are going to become more and more attached to our machines, our computers, our chips, until at some point (see Ray Kurzweil's The Age of Spiritual Machines When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence or Pierre Baldi's The Shattered Self The End of Natural Evolution) the line between us and machine will be completely blurred. And then, molecule by molecule, we will DISAPPEAR, and at no time will we even realize it happened!The Matrix is a vision of the future, but it is a hopelessly anthropomorphic vision, a kind of action\/adventure director's scan, extrapolated from the present. Where artificial intelligence, virtual reality and the prospect of quantum computers is taking us cannot be envisioned at all. Some people call this the singularity factor. The future (and by the way, most of the audience of The Matrix will live to see this) is like the horizon of a black hole that we accelerate toward, never able to see beyond that horizon until we are IN.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

In one scene, Lily rebukes her love interest as being like all the other men on the mountain, only wanting to sit around all day and play music.  That seems odd and inconsistent coming from a music professor who in every other scene shows an intense love and fascination for music.

But this movie broke all my misconceptions of America's favorite animated canine. What actually was just an attempt for me to stare at the gorgeous Freddie Prinze Jr. turned out to be a worthwhile watch.When mysterious happenings begin occuring at Scary Island, its up to the defunct Mystery Inc. to solve the case.After Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr.), Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Shaggy (Matthew Lilard) and Velma (Linda Cardelini) go their own ways, and wind up reuniting in the airport, the team decides to go together to solve the case, which involves zombie-like teenagers at the unusual resort of Scary Island. What is actually happening is that the teen's souls are being removed from their bodies and aliens are taking control of them, using the bodies to withstand sunlight.  Shaggy and Scooby must save the day when Fred, Velma, and Daphne have their soles stolen. It's not gonna be easy, but Mystery Inc. can do anything.I assumed this would be as annoying and trippy as the original cartoon, but it was actually hysterical.  I always thought of myself as kinda like Daphne, but I realized how stupid she really was. Now, I kind of relate to Velma, whose smart but cool at the same time.  The actors were SO good in their parts, and I loved Freddie Prinze Jr. as Fred.  He was so gorgeous!!!!!!!  Sarah Michelle Gellar really played Daphne like an airhead, Matthew Lillard was TOO GOOD as Shaggy (Even sounded like him!!!), and Linda Cardelini resembled Velma, even though I hardly know who she is.My absolute favorite parts were the part in the airport, the flashback scene where Scrappy Doo pees on Daphne, and the part where the gang keeps accidentally switching bodies over the cool artifact.  Shaggy kept checking out Velma's body.  Yikes.  LOL!!!I highly recommend giving this movie a chance, because it is really funny. A bit silly at times, but still very funny.
