I had no idea it was so old - maybe that's why I enjoyed it ! As other users have commented, we see the space-ship coming from the universe, but don't ever see it again. If it could get here, why can't it stick-around ?? AND - after all that gun-play at the camp where the minister is supposed to be prisoner, what actually happened to the other members of his party? Did I miss that ? The scene where they shoot-up the camp is good, although one wonders how did they have all those weapons AND enough ammunition to continue to fire thousands of rounds in the jungle, at something they couldn't see ?Director John McTiernan kept the suspense high and his actors busy, from Jim and John Thomas' script. Arnold (Dutch) actually looked good, orange hair and all. Carl Weathers (Dillion) was excellent in his role, although they could have left-out that arm-wrestling scene in the beginning. I suspect they had some phonies glued on Arnold's arms. Elpidia Arillo (Anna) did what she could with all those macho guys. Bill Duke (Mac) played his role well. Jesse Chaves (Blain) also was good, as all the others were. Jesse Ventura was pretty good, too. The creature (Kevin Peter Hall) was imposing with his height and agility, but I DID see some human elbows between some of the plates.Camera-work was excellent, as were the locations. They added to the tension as the film progressed. I agree the cast did a good job showing the terror of being hunted, after so much gun-play as hunters. I don't think the writers could have put in anything else to show Arnold in all his splendor.Story-wise, not too bad. Because I waited so long to watch Predator, and seeing the other sci-fi films mentioned herein before, I suppose it was no surprise to catch-on that Dutch would be the one to fight him face-to-face. I WAS surprised to see the 'copter was still in the jungle, after all that action. I remember, now, that I saw Predator 2 first - I agree with all who liked Predator better.....it was better.Dutch was right - Predator was not too pretty.....and he was smart. I must agree that he existed on the carnage he provoked; I was surprised there were no bananas hanging on the trees.This movie was well-done, considering when it was released.

The great thing about it is that the original cast was back so I thought this had a good chance of being as good as the first. So I watched the first Father of the Bride and really loved it, so I watched Part 2 right afterwards, I have to say this movie is a bit unbelievable. Now getting pregnant the same time as your mother, it's cool, I can believe it because my grandmother and great grandmother were both pregnant at the same time, but they didn't give birth at the same time at the same hospital. That just seemed a little too coincidental and out of the blue. But Father of the Bride Part 2 still delivers good laughs even if the plot is predictable and unbelievable.George and the family are doing well and are just enjoying life, he's even grown to like Bryan. When Annie and Bryan come over, they announce big news that they are pregnant, everyone is so excited, except for George who has just accepted his daughter being married, now he's going to be a grandpa? But the plot thickens, Nina is pregnant too with George's baby, like mother, like daughter, and when Bryan has to go out of town for work, George has to take over, but with Franck Eggelhoffer's help, that won't be too hard.Father of the Bride Part 2 is predictable and like I said it does get ridicules at times, but it still is a fun film for you and the family. I have to admit that the ending was very sweet, but I won't give that away, you'll have to see for yourself.

It hits all the right notes too, even if the mildly subversive elements of this cautionary tale tend to masquerade as delicious slices of wholesome American nostalgia.First, I should warn you this is NOT a Jim Carrey movie. If you want to see Rubberface goofing around making artless observations about bathroom habits then go watch Ace Ventura or The Mask, or something equally subhumorous...this is not the movie for you.Here, Carrey actually acts, and by the way, he's really good at it. It's 1951 and Jim Carrey finds himself through a series of accidents in a small southern California town with his memory wiped clean. But to the townspeople, his face seems strangely familiar. This town really isn't like every other small town though...from this place, 62 young men sacrificed their lives during the course of WWII, and the friends and family they left behind have been coping with an enormous loss ever since. Because this film was released after 9\/11 it resonates in ways much more profound than the filmmakers could have intended. You feel the impact in the heart more than the head.In the best role of his career, Martin Landau takes one look at Jim Carrey, and sees his only son Luke, missing in action and presumed dead for 9 and a half years. Landau lives above the Majestic, the long neglected movie theater closed down after the war. In an act of tremendous optimism, he decides to reopen the Majestic, and the whole town comes out of their rut and pitches in with the restoration. Besides a father, Luke also discovers he had a beautiful fiancée (the very talented Laurie Holden, from The X-Files) and soon enough they rekindle a gentle courtship. Things seem to be shaping up nicely for Luke if in fact that's who he really is.And that's where the plot takes a turn for better or worse.We live in a fearful age, and the same is true in The Majestic...then and now there are lingering concerns about our liberty and freedom resting in the hands of the powerful and possibly corrupt. In the early 1950's the threat was communism, and the powerful were seated on the House UnAmerican Activities Committee. Without revealing too much about the conclusion, I will say that when Jim Carrey's character is subpoenaed to testify before the committee, he has to choose between his honor and what had been his life. These scenes in their audacity make this movie, and in spite of all the heavy drama, there are a few very funny moments.The Majestic is the summa theologica of Frank Darabont, the man responsible for good films such as The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile. He says that in Hollywood, the story has died. I don't think that is true though, at least in this case. Because this film is not a mournful requiem, it isn't the story of just a man, or a romance, or even a family. It's about us, about ordinary people living in dangerous times--like the townspeople in the film. And through a familiar-faced stranger they found a hero, and a hope they thought had died many years before.The question is, can we do the same?

Me thinks the normal person would not know what was meant with this scene, but if you think it through, you come to realize it resembles his loneliness, the fact that he truly cares for no-one but himself, and that he's alone in his own little world. Honestly, this scene held more hidden emotion than i've ever seen, even more than 'Gladiator' (when Maximus sees his family dead. If that doesn't stir emotion within oneself, then oneself can be called heartless)The story, overall, was intriguing. But, as I mentioned before, it was a bit long at some aspects. It started out a bit slow. Don't hate me for saying this, it's what i think -_-.Overall, this movie is legendary, even more so than Lord of the Rings, or Star-wars even... OK, it's not polite to compare 'Citizen Kane' to movies like them. Hell, I wouldn't even dare remake 'Citizen Kane' for the fact that the public now wishes movies with action, sex, and special effects.

This movie is, in acting, camera and storyline, sublime beyond comparison. Even though it's a little long at some points (hence the 9 i gave it), some parts of the movie moved me. For example When Susan-Alexander left him, en he was yelling I'm Charles Foster Kane!!, I really knew how he must've felt. Orson Welles wrote down his own name in history by simply playing this role. Would he have lived today, me thinks people would have honoured him like they would Elvis.

Travis seems to be in a hazy state, he appears to be slightly doped on some anti-anxiety medication, we can also see him having occasional drinks of booze as he wanders or drives, restlessly, through the sometimes crowded and sometimes nearly empty streets of the city. Travis is a lonely man, kind of locked in himself and looking for a way out, portrayed with amazing skill by De Niro as he shows us the sad, scary life of a lonely man's journey and slow descending into darkness, it all feels completely real. The actors around him also adds to the feeling that what we watch could be a documentary. It's a blunt, honest wiew of a big city; some live, some try to live and some have no life left. Harvey Keitel does some great work in this, the first times I saw the movie I had no idea it was him, he portrays his character with no problems as he always does.

The shootouts are unimaginative and plain stupid with the 1.9 million bullets fired at Leon, with three hitting, then Leon' disappearing acts, where he goes from the ceiling; to the hallway; to the bathroom, then, directly behind the guy he's going to kill, and he does it just like a professional... or a magician. One of the worst parts of the action scenes, especially at the end, is when everything is predictable about 30 seconds before it happens. That's the worst kind of predictability. Where you just find out what's going to happen before it does, because when this thrilling sequence happens- that you've been waiting for 30 seconds- it ends up not being so thrilling, and instead, becomes worthless and terribly ineffective. The Professional is flat. The love story involves Mathilda (Natalie Portman) and Leon (Jean Reno). Portman is twelve and Leon is&#133; old&#133; like 40. Don't be fooled, though, they love each other, but their relationship is strictly platonic. Even though Mathilda is much wiser beyond her years and ready for a sexual relationship, Leon is not, but he is tempted. Besson uses several shots throughout the film that places our eyes directly on the twelve-year-old's body. We get the feeling she's ready for it and that Leon want's it, but like Leon, Besson is tempting us because Leon is tempted. He shows her caressing her stomach, or getting out of bed with a shot directly on her underwear as she walks to the kitchen. Intriguing stuff&#133; expect she's twelve. What's the point of using a twelve-year-old here? I have no idea. Is it ridiculous and over-the-top? Of course it is and maybe that's the reason. Everything else is so stupid and over-the-top it's almost unwatchable and get's really annoying so why not put a twelve- year-old and 40-something in the middle of a weird love story that doesn't make any sense or have any purpose in a film such as this? Even the action is annoying. When it's not annoying it's boring. It's some of the stupidest stuff you'll ever see. It's unintelligent and plain stupid. The director has Leon stand behind a wall, a bunch of bullets go flying through the wall, and Leon is perfectly okay. Better yet, he's standing behind the people who are shooting at the wall he standing behind, and, then he kills them... all of them... in seconds. Wow. That's impressive stuff (sarcasm). Leon sleeps on a chair with sunglasses and a gun not too far away. His best friend is a plant. It doesn't ask questions and Leon likes that. He drinks a glass of milk by the quart; never the gallon. Oh, the excitement!!!! Leon has it all. The best thing that came out of this steaming pile of garbage is Gary Oldman. Like everything else, his character is over-the-top, but he seems to be the only that embraces it and goes with it. He is so good as the crazy, classical music loving, DEA agent that's so corrupt he loves taking lives. He actually, loves it. That's insane, right? Completely unfathomable? That's right, it is, but Oldman seems to be the only one in this that takes this film for what it is. Everyone else, Besson the worst, acts as if this is somehow plausible. That's when action films like this can't be enjoyable. When the directors know, the actors know, the writers know, and the audiences know this is all over-the-top and all about action, action, and more action is when films such as Leon are successful. Not like this, though. Not only are the action sequence poorly done, but the stereotypes of cops left and right with their minds on women, or family problems, or the they're just too stupid to do their job is not only ridiculous but tired and stereotypical and unimaginative. Besson does his best to make this feel anything but European. Reno is supposed to be Italian, see the casting director for that screw up, and Tony (Danny Aiello) is an Italian store-owner who does nothing but order people to be killed- And he has Leon kill a lot of people. Why? Who knows? Besson doesn't understand that's the good stuff. Anyone can make a movie about someone killing someone. Anyone. Tony has a drug ring, but we don't have a clue what it's about, or who it evolves, or where it comes from or anything. The worst part about Aiello's performance is that he thinks this is going to be the 90s version of, The Godfather. Yeah, not working here, leave it to Brando and Pacino to pull off the real Mob Boss performances in real Mob movies. The Last Don didn't do it either. Try reading a script with some depth to it. This takes place in New York City, but you'll get the feeling it takes place in Europe with stupid American's that keep popping up and doing stupid things. It doesn't have much to say about anything. It wants to be bold and outgoing and push the envelope in regards to teens and middle aged men hooking up, but nothing in this film works. The more you think about it, the more you'll be able to pick apart this terribly flawed, substance-less action piece apart. As for the relationship between the forty-year-old and the twelve-year-old? What does it say? Not a whole lot other than love can actually make you happy, but when you're Leon, that doesn't last long and that, too, is predictable.

Why? Who knows? Besson doesn't understand that's the good stuff. Anyone can make a movie about someone killing someone. Anyone. Tony has a drug ring, but we don't have a clue what it's about, or who it evolves, or where it comes from or anything. The worst part about Aiello's performance is that he thinks this is going to be the 90s version of, The Godfather. Yeah, not working here, leave it to Brando and Pacino to pull off the real Mob Boss performances in real Mob movies. The Last Don didn't do it either. Try reading a script with some depth to it. This takes place in New York City, but you'll get the feeling it takes place in Europe with stupid American's that keep popping up and doing stupid things. It doesn't have much to say about anything. It wants to be bold and outgoing and push the envelope in regards to teens and middle aged men hooking up, but nothing in this film works. The more you think about it, the more you'll be able to pick apart this terribly flawed, substance-less action piece apart. As for the relationship between the forty-year-old and the twelve-year-old? What does it say? Not a whole lot other than love can actually make you happy, but when you're Leon, that doesn't last long and that, too, is predictable. This is simply terrible film-making that also looks outdated.

I've only see two films by Quentin Tarantino, and they were both of the Kill Bills. I liked both movies as the popcorn loving action and dark comedy junkie that I am. So I expected something along that line for Pulp Fiction. It is far from it.The best way I can describe this film is a non-chronological list of stories combined together with roller-coaster circumstances. Yes, there is some action. And yes, there is a lot of wicked humor. But what held my attention was the brilliant script by Quentin Tarantino (who won the Oscar for it in 1994). Even more so, the all-star cast flourished it with some stunning performances. John Travolta shed a whole new light on his acting ability as the cynical hit man, Vincent Vegas. Bruce Willis as the boxer, Butch is in a sense a protagonist, but also a man determined to do whatever it takes to get what he wants, even if it means killing. Uma Thurman is simply marvelous as the amusing drug addict Mia.

It had really good action sequences and its visual effects were ahead of its time.

So believable that when I saw the scene with the Rex chasing the hunters and the other scene where the Rexes push the trailer off the cliff, I had a heart attack. This movie also one upped from its predecessor by placing the T-Rex in an actual city, and this was a year before Godzilla came out. In terms of characterization, I liked it that they made the genius mathematician Ian Malcolm the top character of the story. In the novel he was a key character who actually predicted that the park would fail, yet in the first movie it was more about Dr. Grant and the kids. The only thing that this movie may have failed in is just the dialogue which sounded a bit rehearsed, rushed, too quiet and used a bit too many big words and when I saw this movie I was 7 so I had a bit of trouble on trying to capture the plot.

While the performances by the actors are fantastic, and Nicholson plays a fantastic lunatic, I found the movie to be in-cohesive and to lack structure. Maybe it is necessary to read the book first to understand everything in the film, maybe not. Not having read the book, however, I found the movie full of loose ends that were never tied up. On a positive note, the film was sufficiently scary, I did find the suspense\/thriller aspect of it very well done, and the scene with the blood spilling was very clever and disturbing. However, I found there was no explanation for many things. Danny's Shining ability seems pointless in the film. He sees things that we already know happened, he has this ability that doesn't help him in any way. His father still goes mad, and it is his mother's resourcefulness that saves them, not his ability. All his special talent does is make the kid a little scary, especially in the redrum scene. Apart from making him creepy, I don't think his gift serves any purpose in the film. It summons Halloran, and this part is built up and up with him coming to the rescue, and he is butchered before anything even remotely interesting happens, thus making his and Danny's ability an utter waste of time. The scene with the woman in the bathtub is gross, true, but pointless. It shows nothing. And the ending is very drawn out. When the film finally does conclude, and I was waiting for all these loose ends to be tied up, that photograph is shown of Jack in the past, confusing me ten times more and leaving the storyline completely open for interpretation. You've always been here is what he is told, and we see that, so what the heck was happening in the mean time, with Grady, with Jack's wife and son, with Halloran (didn't he know Jack was already caretaker?)... Nothing is answered, nothing is concluded, I found the ending really frustrating and disappointing. If this film was meant to be only a frightening thriller, then it has achieved its purpose.

And I am happy to report that all the positive word of mouth is right on the money, and that this really is some kind of great work. As most folks seem to have already discovered, The Others takes place on the isle of Jersey in 1945, where Grace (superbly played by Nicole Kidman) awaits the homecoming of her soldier husband, whilst caring for her photosensitive children and breaking in some new domestic help. Soon, though, Grace's worries are greatly added to by strange noises upstairs, the sound of a sobbing child, and the tinkling of a piano in an empty room. It would seem that her lavish mansion has been invaded by...spirits? Featuring an endlessly fascinating story line, interesting characters, fine production values, a creeping sense of dread and a good number of jolts, The Others really does make for a top-notch, classy horror movie. Amenabar not only wrote the screenplay for and directed this great picture, but also provided the film's lovely\/creepy score. (The man must be some kind of a friggin' genius!) Fionnula Flanagan (who, incidentally, impresses me no end by dint of her having appeared on three Star Trek series!) is marvelous here as the housekeeper, Mrs. Mills; how wonderful to see her and Kidman giving two very Oscar-worthy performances in their many shared scenes. The picture features an absolutely brilliant ending that I was not prepared for (those who have read E.F.

As most folks seem to have already discovered, The Others takes place on the isle of Jersey in 1945, where Grace (superbly played by Nicole Kidman) awaits the homecoming of her soldier husband, whilst caring for her photosensitive children and breaking in some new domestic help. Soon, though, Grace's worries are greatly added to by strange noises upstairs, the sound of a sobbing child, and the tinkling of a piano in an empty room. It would seem that her lavish mansion has been invaded by...spirits? Featuring an endlessly fascinating story line, interesting characters, fine production values, a creeping sense of dread and a good number of jolts, The Others really does make for a top-notch, classy horror movie. Amenabar not only wrote the screenplay for and directed this great picture, but also provided the film's lovely\/creepy score. (The man must be some kind of a friggin' genius!) Fionnula Flanagan (who, incidentally, impresses me no end by dint of her having appeared on three Star Trek series!) is marvelous here as the housekeeper, Mrs. Mills; how wonderful to see her and Kidman giving two very Oscar-worthy performances in their many shared scenes.

Danny forgoes college and uses his tuition money to help Mr Miyagi open a store to sell Bonsai Trees.Now think about that for a second, the kid (in name only) just gave away his future to help an old man with a store sell something maybe 10 people out of every 100 want.Meanwhile evil dojo owner John Kreese (played by Martin Klove) is down on his luck, avoiding bill collectors after his students ditch him after his outburst in the second movie. He plans to retire but his old Vietnam War buddy Terry Silver talks him out of it. Terry convinces Kreese to go on vacation while he plans revenge against Danial and Miyagi. He enlists the help of renegade karate kid Mike Barnes (Sean Kanan) to pester Daniel into defending his under-18 title.The funniest thing is that the actor who played Silver, Thomas Ian Griffith, was 27 at the time making him a year YOUNGER than Ralph Macchio. Its just hilarious knowing this fact to see Thomas bully Ralph around like he's a little boy. Sean Kanan was supposed to be playing a 17 year old and he was 23 himself. In fact, only Robyn Lively who played Jessica Andrews was the age she was supposed to be, 17. John Kreese and Terry Silver were supposed to be Nam buddies, now with Martin Klove at 45, I could believe him but with T.I.G. only 27, I found it really hard to believe HE was in nam.

Ralph Macchio was pushing 30 so there was no way a 4th movie could be made (with him as the lead character) so why have an ending where NOTHING is settled?

Case in point Full Metal Jacket.Full Metal Jacket is the last movie Kubrick made that wasn't Eyes Wide Shut, one big reason I think it has such a strong cheering section on this board. Yes, it's intense, singular, and full of great quotes. It's also threadbare plot-wise and structurally unbalanced, full of one-dimensional performances and an overabundance of Kubrick's trademark shots.Pvt. Joker (Matthew Modine) is the central character, who we follow on his journey from Parris Island to Hue City, Vietnam, where during the Tet Offensive he becomes born-again hard and acquires the much-storied quality known as the 1,000-yard stare.I like this film, just not a lot. It's what I'd call a Kubrick problem picture much like his Barry Lyndon, a good movie of entirely different character that carries much of the same pedantic weight. I can't really get into Full Metal Jacket, neither Modine nor anyone else garners my sympathy or lasting interest, but its exciting and arresting in its refusal to play by the rules of a Vietnam war film. In The Deer Hunter or Platoon, for example, the loss of innocence is a central theme. Here it's clear innocence was lost long before these guys arrived in 'Nam.For many people, it's the first 45 minutes that make this film great, the boot camp section with the bullying drill instructor Hartmann (R. Lee Ermey) and his rounding on fragile conscript Pvt. Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio), a.k.a. Gomer Pyle. My orders are to weed out all non-hackers who do not pack the gear to serve in my beloved Corps, Hartmann explains at the outset, but his treatment of Pyle suggests a darker motive.Full Metal Jacket is a dark film all the way, and for me, the middle section is the part worth watching, in which we discover the war in Joker's eyes, in a series of short, pungent vignettes taken from Michael Herr's twisted and brilliant war memoir Dispatches The dead have been covered with lime. The dead know only one thing - it is better to be alive.Kubrick's camera ODs on carnage, emotional and physical, making us feel as deep in that world of excrement as poor Private Pyle. The unrelenting heaviness of tone brings one to the point where you expect a bigger payoff in the end than you actually get. Joker loses some comrades, gets his stare, and marches on to the tune of the Mickey Mouse Club, a scene that strives for more irony than it actually delivers.But Kubrick's movie is hard where it needs to be, aided much by the vicious comic stylings of Ermey, the subdued inventiveness of set designer Anton Furst (you try dressing England into a jungly war zone), and a terrific musical score of sardonically placed AM pop. It's a film worth having, but I think if Kubrick had bestowed his talent and vision on a couple of other projects in the last 20 years of his life, this movie wouldn't enjoy the somewhat bloated reputation it has today.
