Hanks and Candy played brothers in the funny Splash (1984), but neither did as well with their characters in this film.I suppose it was the weak script, because they are good comic actors, and Nicholas Meyer is a good director who had already proved that to me a few years prior with Star Trek 2 The Wrath of Khan, if not in earlier flicks like Time After Time (1979) and The Seven Percent Solution (1976).The identity-switch premise is standard comic fare, and we know that in the end, the Hanks character will take on the identity he is faking and do what that character would do. Likewise for getting the girl.Hanks & Candy could have carried off the predictable jokes a lot better than they did, and the Candy set-up for the brainwashing in the swipe of a screen was so weak I almost missed it. The joke of his babbling communist slogans and rhetoric back at his captors to the point of annoyance is just that annoying. It too, could have worked better.Rita Wilson was a poor choice as the love-interest. I guess she's okay in minor supporting roles, and I know a few people who liked her as the love-interest in Mixed Nuts (1994), but in this role, her exasperation with life in the jungle jokes, in juxtaposition to Hanks' ease with it, are weakly played and not very funny.There are some spots where the script allows the actors to be funny, but they are few and far between, and often underplayed. I know enough of the tastes of my friends and clients to say there are about half of them who would like this movie okay enough, and half who would wish they had watched something else, like Splash, if they wanted to see Hanks & Candy together.Thus, I would rate this movie as Average (5 out of 10), but just barely. If you find it in a bargain-bin, as I did, you might want to pick it up if you are a Hanks and Candy fan and already have Splash, but I would rather spend my money on the latter if I didn't already have it.

It surpasses even such masterpieces as Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan or Stone's Platoon. Reading comments on this website, I came to conclusion there is no middle way (there are exceptions, of course) with this movie; or you love it or you hate it. Well, I love it. I can't agree with arguments given by people who hated it, furthermore, I can't even understand most of them, which mainly areA - Movie is too one-sided. Now, I never saw a war movie where both sides would be equally presented. In Saving Private Ryan we don't get to know Germans. In Platoon we don't get to know Vietcong. In Thin Red Line we don't get to know Japanese etc, etc. In a battle, you take care about yourself and your comrades, not about a person who is shooting at you, whether you will make his children orphans or not. There are complaints that Somalis are presented as angry, blood-thirsty mob. Well, according to the book, they did act semi-suicidal, without any knowledge about combat tactics, so on numerous occasion they ended up shooting their own people. No wonder why number of their casualties was so high.B - Movie is flag-waving, recruitment ad, pro-war. First, to let you know, I'm NOT an American. Sure, it's patriotic, but what's wrong with that? I always thought patriotism is a value. If someone is confusing patriotism with nationalism, that's his problem. Some say it didn't address bigger picture, why Americans went in Somalia in the first place. But BHD didn't have these ambitions. It's about brotherhood in arms, not political thriller about US foreign policy. Like Bowden stated in his book Soldiers cannot concern themselves with the decisions that bring them to a fight. They trust their leaders not to risk their lives for too little. Once the battle is joined, they fight to survive, to kill before they are killed. It seems some people refuse to realize the movie is telling a story of America's elite soldiers in that particular event, from their point of view. However, there is a subtle message about uselessness of US engagement in Somalia, it's just not in a form of some angry speech, given by a bitter soldier. I also don't understand how this movie is pro-war. Don't know about you, but I wouldn't put images of Rangers being blown to pieces in a recruitment ad if I would be making one.C - Poor character development. Now, I can partly agree with this statement, but it's necessary to point out, movie isn't a character study. Sure, Hartnett has a leading role which should be more developed, but movie is more focused on course of battle in Mog as such, on showing a perspective of many involved, so there really isn't much room for detailed personal portrait. Some say, it's hard to identify with characters when we know so little about them. In this movie, this doesn't seem to be the case. I found BHD very emotional movie.  Acting is very good, facial expressions and acts of soldiers showed us anxiety, fear, courage, sacrifice, grief etc. For many, Eric Bana as Hoot was too Rambo-type, but his character is based on real-life Delta who really was a tough guy (read the book). The music was also excellent to spur on emotions.Of course, movie isn't perfect, but show me the one which is. US soldiers are just too nice, you-gotta-love-them types, dialogue is poor. But apart from that, it's visually perfect, as realistic as it gets, pure chaos and confusion, just like war really is. Most of the time it's like documentary.

Well, the upshot is I don't like it.  That's not to say that I think it was a bad movie; certainly it was well written and competently acted and, give a sigh of relief, does not fall into the Hollywood mainstream.So why didn't I like it?  First of all, I think it's something to do with the style which writer\/director Richard Kelly decided to do it.  FRANK, the mysterious figure of Darko's apparent hallucinations, is dressed in a rabbit suit.  This leads one to think of another famous movie with a six foot rabbit, Harvey.  Certainly from reading the synopses of this movie - something like The world is coming to an end and only Donnie Darko knows anything about it - one might have thought that Donnie Darko falls into the same category as Harvey and other movies in which the protagonist sees things that other people can't and consequently appears to everybody else to be a madman.  (Blithe Spirit (1946) is another example.)  However, there is a crucial difference between Harvey and Donnie Darko.  Harvey works because the audience *believes the protagonist*.  However mad or drunk James Stewart acts, the audience knows that Harvey is real and that Stewart's behaviour is consistent.  What we see in Donnie Darko, however, is a character set up as emotionally disturbed.  He sees a mysterious character, who tells him to do things - bad things, illegal things - and Darko does them.  He's responding to the voices in his head, and the fact that we, the audience, also see Frank, does not alter the fact that we see Darko from our point of view as normal people do.  The consequences of these actions reveal some evil in one case and lead to tragedy in another.  At the end, however, we see Kelly resorting to what we Star Trek fans refer to as the rewind button, and consequently we can interpret (here comes the SPOILER) the entire movie as being a paranoid delusion of Darko's.  Apparently the tragic outcome no longer occurs, but then neither does the revelation of genuine evil in a character thought of by the locals as good.What all this amounts to is that the message of this movie appears to me to be Paranoid schizophrenics really *are* better off dead! which I'm sure Kelly didn't intend.  But because of the style where what was in Darko's head was never seen outside his head, it is the unavoidable conclusion.As a general work of moviemaking, there are a number of flaws.  Although Darko and his fellow students are described by Barrymore's teacher character as apathetic and emotionally detached, I feel the script takes emotional detachment far too much to its heart.  The revelation of evil I spoke of is the discovery that Swayze's inspirational speaker is in fact a child porn merchant.  But we don't remotely see what this involved (apart from a few lines about a dungeon in his house) and after the revelation we never even meet the character again.  Then again, Kitty's defense of him occurs in one scene but has no further consequences.  Kitty's character is inconsistent - she is a religiously-inclined woman who wants an innocent Graham Greene short story banned, yet she also apparently choreographed a troupe of 13-year old girls to dance in the sexiest manner possible.  Is there a connection with this, her devotion to Swayze's character, and his predilections?  It simply isn't explored.  The character of Donnie's love interest, Gretchen Ross, isn't formed fully enough for us to be able to either empathise with her or with Donnie's fascination for her.  After he asks her to go with him and she says yes, she doesn't appear again until after Donnie's talk with Mrs Thurman (a long-awaited reappearance from Katharine Ross, incidentally) in which he confesses his fear of dying alone.  This is a fundamental structural flaw - it's almost like Kelly forgot about her in the intervening scenes.I'm afraid that whatever concepts Kelly has of time travel indicate a woeful ignorance of the extensive literature on time travel, both by scientists and in the realm of serious science fiction, causing everything to be said by all the characters on this subject to be vapid pseudo-intellectual rubbish which didn't make the first step towards explaining the ultimate working out of the movie's plot.Supposed stylistic elements like the use of fast cutting, hand held cameras, mixed slow and fast motion, had no contribution to make to our understanding of the story or the characters, particularly Darko, and came across as a rookie director putting those things in to attract attention to himself.

In the first, you are following these scientists going to Africa to find a virus outbreak. Next thing you know, you're watching a helicopter go head on with a plane.First comes the acting. Dustin Hoffman is stupendous as always, Rene Russo plays Robbie with realism, Kevin Spacey makes for a good humor man, Cuba Gooding Jr. pulls off the green man trying to earn respect, and being a bad-ass at the same time. As always, Morgan Freeman is wonderful. Any role I see him in is a role I remember. He's always different, too, neigh does he ever repeat in characterization. Sometimes he's funny, sometimes he's incredibly serious. Last but not least comes Donald Sutherland, one of my favorite actors to date. He can jump into the shoes of any character, including the general trying to protect a secret he knows he shouldn't. One actor whom I particularly enjoyed watching was J.T. Walsh. It's a great shame he died, I liked all his stuff from Breakdown to Pleasantville. He is only in Outbreak for about five minutes, but he has one of my favorite monologues in the history of film. He commands attention as he speaks.Next comes the story itself. A very to-date story. A one all can relate to because it could very well happen. A virus from Africa makes its way here and begins infecting all, without a cure. I liked that there was a hero aspect in Sam Daniels. he was the tracker, the hunter, the curist. Coupled with the story comes the dialogue. Rich, under-appreciated, funny, and serious all wrapped into one. As I said before, the monologue for Walsh is brilliant. Many lines are etched into my mind, and are often used in conversation. Too bad no one knows what I'm saying.I'm a bit surprised this film didn't bode too well with audiences. Mayhap they didn't want to see what could happen, who knows? My only complaint is character endings. You insinuate what happens to McClintock and Ford, also Sam and Robbie, but we don't ever see Casey again. I could infer that he dies, but he could very well have survived.

It seems that what we are seeing is a Hollywood version of that story. Could it be accurate as some viewers claimed on here? Were they there when it happened? After all, did they read the news directly from the Somali news agents? I doubt it.

This is indeed the typical US arrogant attitude toward third world people. There are always two sides to the same story. So you might be deeply moved by what you saw in this movie, but you don't really know how the Somali people think about that event? After all, only about 19 US soldiers died, while over 1,000 Somali people were killed. How would you feel if someone killed that many people in your very own city in your own country?This movie is good entertainment for anyone who wants to see how soldiers fight in an urban setting, but just don't assume that everything you saw is all real.The following was writing on 25 April 2004. Even though I have never participated in any war activities, and I hope that i never will, I think that this movie has given us a very realistic powerful view on the cruel bloody war. close to the end of the movie, it is emotionally shocking to see an old man holding a dead boy's body walking pass right in front of a war tank car. Whoever decide to put that scene in the movie did an excellent job of giving out the powerful message about the importance of peace.For the first 30 minutes or so, there were several clues about the soldiers making wrong life decisions, because they thought that this mission would be easy and short.

","genre":"Drama, History, War"},{"date":"25 April 2004","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  The success of The Rugrats Movie inspired a whole host of animated TV shows to hit the big screen, but none of their movies - apart from the first Rugrats sequel - have had anything like the same popularity (don't bet on a sequel to Hey Arnold! The Movie turning up any time ever). The Cartoon Network's first movie The Powerpuff Girls does deserve credit for ambition; this is an origins movie (and unlike some movies based on TV shows, this does feel like a proper movie) and it's not afraid to be serious. In fact, that's the biggest problem with the tale - for a lot of the time it's almost too serious to be as much fun as its source.As explained on one TV episode (and here - score points for continuity), Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup were invented when Professor Utonium's chimp assistant pushed him while he was blending sugar, spice and everything nice, and caused him to accidentally add an extra ingredient to the concoction...

The mobsters use an off-shore freighter, The Tortugo, to tap into underwater bank cables and steal millions of dollars in bank transactions. That plan falls apart when the feisty and pretty civil lawyer Kate McQueen, Cindy Crawford, got in their way and had to be eliminated in order for them to keep up their illegal activities.

This gang of ex-KGB thugs really mean business as they blow up half of South Florida to get the pair, Max & Kate. As usual, in the movies, Max & Kate are always one step ahead of them and the mobsters no matter how much men and firepower as well as electronic equipment that they have are no match against the two who have almost nothing but the clothes on their back, and some times not even that, to fight them with. Far more violent then most action police movies with almost the entire cast wiped out, with the exception of Max & Kate of course, by the ending credits.

Can't Buy Me Love ridicules the high school caste system--that popular kids are the invincible social class that other social groups strive to be part of, but are limited by the understood rigid rules of their place among the social system. Ronald (Patrick Dempsey) is supposed to be the hopeless nerd. He's a quiet kid that flocks with loners (one of them being the cool Max Perlich). Ronald is in love with senior cheerleader, Cindy Mancini (Amanda Peterson). As the popular, rich cheerleader, she is definitely hands off for Ronald. Ronald wants the girl. He wants to be popular. Is it possible for the geek to transcend his expected role in the game of high school social groups? Definitely, but for Ronald, the consequences are disasturous and also conducive to helping Ronald straighten out his priorities of friendship, love, and the like.

Ronald doesn't only push Cindy away, but also his closest friend, Kenneth (Courtney Gains) and the rest of his old crowd of friends who hate their friend's newfound social life. But, how far is Ronald willing to go?

Full review can be found at wiredonmovies.com--There's not that much of a story, really. What do we do? We drive around. Maybe he's going to get married, maybe not. It's really more about the fact that it's a very honest portrayal of a group...of guys that people relate to on a very personal level.- Kevin Bacon on the Diner DVD interview reelIn the opening scene of Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs, a handful of characters debate the true meaning of Madonna's hit song Like a Virgin. Long before Reservoir Dogs (a decade, to be exact), there was Barry Levinson's directorial debut, Diner, a coming-of-age tale concerning five Baltimore residents in their 20s who try to get past crucial points in their lives. In a similar scene to that in Tarantino's masterpiece, four friends -- played by Steve Guttenberg, Mickey Rourke, Daniel Stern, and Paul Reiser -- argue over which singer produces better make-out music Mathis or Sinatra? Presley, says Rourke's character, ending the conversation with blunt confidence. And that's that.The movie has plentiful rich dialogue, some of it seemingly pointless, most of it subtly touching and meaningful. The film has a lot to say about the difference between friendship and true love. I love you, one of the characters tells the woman he wants to marry. Fixated on an object behind him, her eyes cold and a grim reflection of deep contemplation, she replies, You're confusing a friendship with a woman, and love. It's not the same. In a very different sort of way, it tackles the same material as When Harry Met Sally, but it doesn't stop there.The film is masterful in its ability to present us with a group of people we sincerely care for, and who all seem very real -- more so than the characters you'll find in most movies.

It's really more about the fact that it's a very honest portrayal of a group...of guys that people relate to on a very personal level.- Kevin Bacon on the Diner DVD interview reelIn the opening scene of Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs, a handful of characters debate the true meaning of Madonna's hit song Like a Virgin. Long before Reservoir Dogs (a decade, to be exact), there was Barry Levinson's directorial debut, Diner, a coming-of-age tale concerning five Baltimore residents in their 20s who try to get past crucial points in their lives.

And that's that.The movie has plentiful rich dialogue, some of it seemingly pointless, most of it subtly touching and meaningful. The film has a lot to say about the difference between friendship and true love. I love you, one of the characters tells the woman he wants to marry.

Why aren't their more good comic book films? After all they are both primarily a visual medium.  The  pre-visualization process in films often referred to as storyboarding look a hell of a lot like a comic book. Many of today's action and Sci-Fi films borrow liberally from comic book conventions. Heck, its now apart of our pop culture language. You'll be watching a film (not necessarily one based on a comic book)and someone will comment `that's so comic book'  So why don't films based on comic books end up decent. Why do 80% of them suck.heck some would say 95%. And why is a little film released in 1978 called Superman still one of the best. First of all why comic books don't usually make good movies. You might expect me to list all the reasons why Hollywood usually gets it wrong. I'm not going to do that. I am of the opinion that comic books .specifically super hero comic books.shouldn't be made into films. You see suspension of disbelief goes so far when you are witnisting a live action portrayal of a work of fiction. You can see a guy dressed in blue and red tights in 2d comic page and it fine. For some reason we accept it. Heck take that same concept and put it in a cartoon or video game and we accept it. But for some reason the bar is way higher when you take a real actor and put him on screen in that costume. What was once nifty camp or down right fun is now silly. So why dose Superman work? It works because it manages to balance how much its willing to take itself seriously. The filmmakers, I'm speaking now of Tom Mankiewicz and the afore mentioned Richard Donner. They knew that to pull this off you cant go completely camp, that would betray the character. But on the same token you cant make it all serous and no fun. They seemed to know exactly where that line was and crossed it only slightly. Superman is an American icon; they seemed to respect this fact. Certain scenes like Superman getting the cat out of the tree are pure iconic imagery. From the interstellar beginnings, featuring a great performance by Mr. Marlon Brando himself. To the extremely picturesque Americana of his Smallville upbringing. The first two sections of the film seem to bring the icon though the pages and ot (what was then) contemporary America circa 1978. It's this journey that makes the rest of the film believable. Few films portraying super heroes do even (what would seem to be) the simple task of telling the characters origin properly. In taking the time to do this the film is already light years ahead of any films of this type. In viewing the documentaries on the Warner DVD one discovers that it was Brando and Hackmans attachment to the film that got it off the ground. But the star of this film isn't Jor- El or Lex, its in the name. So yet another in a series of good decisions on the part of the filmmakers was to cas an unknown as the titular alien in the cape. Christopher Reeve plays the clumsy geek that is Clark to perfection. An actor who so completely owned that part I find it hard picturing anyone else in the role. When the time comes to reveal Superman to the word, the stark contrast in the two `roles' he plays is never more apparent. Gene Hackman is fantastic as the self proclaimed `worlds greatest criminal mind' Lex Luthor. He seems to be having so much fun antagonizing Supes. The only casting choice I sort of disagree with is Margot Kidder. Growing up with this film (and its subsequent sequels) I always though she was too silly for the role. When one views the screen testes and sees the other actreses considered this only cements my feelings. Their were at least two that I felt would have been better in the role. All in all we are left with a film that is as classic as the hero it portrays. As I write this Hollywood is clamoring to put together a team for a new Supes film.

Why aren't their more good comic book films? After all they are both primarily a visual medium.  The  pre-visualization process in films often referred to as storyboarding look a hell of a lot like a comic book. Many of today's action and Sci-Fi films borrow liberally from comic book conventions. Heck, its now apart of our pop culture language. You'll be watching a film (not necessarily one based on a comic book)and someone will comment `that's so comic book'  So why don't films based on comic books end up decent. Why do 80% of them suck.heck some would say 95%. And why is a little film released in 1978 called Superman still one of the best. First of all why comic books don't usually make good movies. You might expect me to list all the reasons why Hollywood usually gets it wrong. I'm not going to do that. I am of the opinion that comic books .specifically super hero comic books.shouldn't be made into films. You see suspension of disbelief goes so far when you are witnisting a live action portrayal of a work of fiction. You can see a guy dressed in blue and red tights in 2d comic page and it fine. For some reason we accept it. Heck take that same concept and put it in a cartoon or video game and we accept it. But for some reason the bar is way higher when you take a real actor and put him on screen in that costume. What was once nifty camp or down right fun is now silly. So why dose Superman work? It works because it manages to balance how much its willing to take itself seriously. The filmmakers, I'm speaking now of Tom Mankiewicz and the afore mentioned Richard Donner. They knew that to pull this off you cant go completely camp, that would betray the character. But on the same token you cant make it all serous and no fun. They seemed to know exactly where that line was and crossed it only slightly. Superman is an American icon; they seemed to respect this fact. Certain scenes like Superman getting the cat out of the tree are pure iconic imagery. From the interstellar beginnings, featuring a great performance by Mr. Marlon Brando himself. To the extremely picturesque Americana of his Smallville upbringing. The first two sections of the film seem to bring the icon though the pages and ot (what was then) contemporary America circa 1978. It's this journey that makes the rest of the film believable. Few films portraying super heroes do even (what would seem to be) the simple task of telling the characters origin properly. In taking the time to do this the film is already light years ahead of any films of this type. In viewing the documentaries on the Warner DVD one discovers that it was Brando and Hackmans attachment to the film that got it off the ground. But the star of this film isn't Jor- El or Lex, its in the name. So yet another in a series of good decisions on the part of the filmmakers was to cas an unknown as the titular alien in the cape. Christopher Reeve plays the clumsy geek that is Clark to perfection. An actor who so completely owned that part I find it hard picturing anyone else in the role.

That was so funny and also when he came out of the burning school and when he was walking funny, that just made me laugh. Colin Hanks also played really well as he is the son of my favorite actor Tom Hanks. This is probably Jack Black's funniest movie.

You may hate it because the inner child in you has not been released. You may love it because the inner child in you have full reign and want a wonderful fairy tale. This film has all the elements, flying ships (A balloon made of ladies knickers), monsters (A gigantic whale that looks like an island), and a little girl observing all the fantastical adventures. A city is under siege and a theater troupe is trying to perform a play during all of this. In comes an elderly man (The wonderful John Neville)who claims that the troupe has it all wrong and that he, himself, is the real Baron and wants to tell the story straight. From there, his adventure really takes off. He and Sally (The cute as a button Sarah Polley)go off in search of his friends to help save the city Berthold (Clever Eric Idle), the fastest man around; Albrecht, the strongest man in the world; Adolphus, the man with the sharpest sight around and Gustavus, the man with the keen hearing and breath that can blow elephants off their feet. The gangs adventures bring them to the Moon, where the King (Wild as ever Robin Williams)has trouble holding on to his head, to the Underworld, where Venus (Beautiful Uma Thurman)drives her hubby Vulcan (The wonderful Oliver Reed) insane with jealousy. The story and the visuals (Especially the Moon) are beautiful and the ending is interesting. You get so caught up in the story that the viewer gets lost in what is real and what is not. Great for teens and up. Kids may get scared at some of the scenes.
