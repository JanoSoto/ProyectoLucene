To watch a film like this. I have only seen three other Lynch films in their entirety (I'm still having trouble watching all of Inland Empire). I have no idea if people on this board like this film, but I do know that many here like Lynch and his unusual style. Saying unusual is an understatement too.The sound design in this film is phenomenal, if not bizarre and is the film's key ingredient. If this sound design did not work then I do not think the film would have such a cult following. Everything is heightened to an extreme and surreal beyond what one can imagine. Thew squeaking of the puppies, the disturbance of the radiator, so on and so on.If I were to actually try and figure out what the film was about, my head would explode ala Scanners. I get some themes and meanings, but was lost in the so called narrative, if you can call it that. Lynch has always been one for the abnormal things and this is no different. I can say that this is one of his weirder ones and that is saying a lot.The dream sequence ties into the title and seem to have nothing to do with the film, upon first look that is. Eraserhead is definitely a 'watch more then once' experience. You can debate with everyone about what the film was trying to say or what the hell is was even about, but no one can be certain. I don't even think Lynch knows.Now whenever you watch a film that is experimental, you try to find some value and meaning within it. You want it to be more than just another weird film for the sake of being weird. Lynch has been accused of this many times, but I think he is better than that. His films do have substance, you can tell in how he tells the story and how things seem to re-appear. Unlike other films where they pop up and are never seen again. Even though there are numerous scenes that just simply don't make sense to me, like when the daughter is sitting on the couch and doing something weird, then the mother brushes her hair. Even worse is when the chicken starts bleeding and the mother reacts to it in a bizarre manner.This is my least favourite of Lynch's films, for the simple fact that I never was interested in what little story there was. It didn't seem to go anywhere and for me to be invested in a film it has to be telling a story, one that I can understand, comprehend, or at the very least, try to look more into. Eraserhead did none of this for me. After watching it, I do not really care to watch it again to find any hidden meanings or to try and understand whatever it is that I missed from the first viewing. I can go on in life saying that Eraserhead did nothing for me and of course be hated for it, but whatever.But never say never right? Who knows, maybe one day down the road I'll get a chance to watch this so called 'masterpiece' again, and think it's brilliant. Until then, I'll say not.

If they're making a comedy, they just use an overabundance of generic sex jokes and have some nerdy teens do predictable off-the-wall things. If they're making an action film, they form a generic main character, give him a clichéd reason to care about him, and insert some explosions between his melodramatic scenes. If they're making a horror film, they just create a generic plot line for whatever sub-genre they're trying to appease. For this review, however, let's look at psychological horror. The generic formula for psychological horror films A sole event takes place (i.e. a death, a job, a problem in school), which the mentally unstable main character is caught up in, then finds out the event had\/has some sort of dark psychological back-story, then the movie comes crashing down with the main character finally realizes his true mental state. Think how many movies that describes. I can think of about 30 off the top of my head. I'm sure there is even more. And Session 9 is just another one.In reality, I could end this review with that.

If you've seen one cow, you don't need someone to describe in detail what a different cow looks like&#151;give or take trivial details, they're all exactly the same.

If you have any intelligence at all, don't watch Session 9. There isn't any more to be said. However . . .There are even more problems here. The biggest one, second only to the unabashed unoriginality, is the sheer boredom of the film. This is mainly due to the fact you know everything that is going to happen in the opening 10 seconds. When you know what's going to happen, how can you NOT be bored? But, to add to that, the pacing is so slow it's nearly unbearable. The dialogue is unintentionally hilarious at points, but it's still some of the driest and most uninteresting dialogue I've ever heard in my life. And dialogue is over 3\/4th of film.The other major problem is the stupidity of the plot in the first place. It amuses me how many writers\/directors uses cliché psychological plot points, but they don't even understand them. I think they just watched Fight Club or Se7en, went in their pants out of amazement, and decided to copy those ideas and paste them into their own script. But beside that, the psychological elements are so obviously innocent it had me laughing out loud. This movie has been called thinking man's horror, and that is about the equivalent of calling the SpongeBob Halloween episode thinking man's horror. They both present about the same amount of thought-provoking ideas, morals, and clever plotting.Beyond that, Session 9 uses every horror cliché ever used, and it adds yet another layer of cheese to the plot.

Space Jam happens to fall into the category of okay, but with many flaws.This wacky film stars basketball legend Michael Jordan, who is more or less, a so-so actor. At the height of his career, Michael wanted to retire from basketball to play baseball. To promote sales and products, Hollywood producers gave him a chance to act in front of the camera. He agreed, but only playing as himself.The real strong point of this film is that it stars the Looney Tunes, some of the world's most recognized and beloved cartoon characters. Despite their grand entrance, the movie received lukewarm reviews in it's first few weeks. It was also criticized for having a somewhat ridiculous story, in which a tyrant named Mr. Swackhammer (Danny Devito) wants to build a new attraction by kidnapping Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes at a distant theme park known as Moron Mountain. Throughout the movie, Michael and his buddies work hard to challenge the tyrant's helpers to a basketball game. If they lose, they will be forced to entertain the hard-pleased natives of Moron Mountain for all eternity.Space Jam is one of the few films where the Looney Tunes characters get their chance to express themselves on the big screen. Whereas most of their movies had basically added segments and poor animation, Space Jam was an original concept that gave the cartoon characters more depth. The animation looks beautiful and the live action blends in well with the cartoon environment.Unfortunately that doesn't make up for the fact that the jokes and gags that are famous in numerous Looney Tune cartoons didn't make it into the movie. Weak dialog and somewhat poor plots revealed in Space Jam doesn't compare to the humor of the old cartoons or the better writing seen in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Some of the actors come up short, including the NBA players who simply play themselves. Wayne Knight was a goofy addition to the cast, but he was simply more annoying than tolerable. Bill Murray (Saturday Night Live, GhostBusters, Groundhog Day) was a disappointment, coming across as irritated and unlikeable by playing himself.Still the good outnumbers the bad, and personally I think the critics were being too harsh on this film. The addition of Lola Bunny was a nice touch, and there were a few hilarious moments worth mentioning. It also has a good soundtrack, which fits in with the theme of Space Jam.The film had a lot of merchandise going for it, and sadly it didn't hold up to it's full potential. If you get past the so-so acting of the live actors and the somewhat clichéd plot, Space Jam is a funny film that will entertain kids and Looney Tune fans alike. It wasn't merely aiming at an adult demographic, but it is still enjoyable by those who have watched the cartoon shorts. Not the best live action\/animated film, but certainly not the worst either.Six out of Ten.

To me this film came off as a mix between A Clockwork Orange and Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer but no where near the brilliance of those two. There's a lot to admire here and you have to give the filmmakers a lot of credit for pulling this off on such a low budget but in the end the movie just didn't work for me. I think the biggest problem is that the black humor is so hit and miss that the whole message of the film gets lost over time. There are some downright hysterical moments in this film including an unforgettable sequence involving an old woman with a bad heart but for every great scene like this one we get at least three that don't contain the humor. The graphic violence, which earned the film the NC-17 rating, wasn't as bad as I was expecting and in fact I found it somewhat light considering a few other movies out there that I've seen. The violence that is on display certainly goes to the message of the film and on how people of today look at violence but at the same time I think some of this gets lost as the film keeps going. The entire premise of the story is a rather interesting one and I couldn't help but think how realistic the film was if something like this was to ever really happen. I can't help but think some nutty film crew would eventually end up helping this maniac for the sake of their film getting finished. I also couldn't help but think people watching this maniac would be so scared of him that they couldn't try to stop anything he was doing, which is the point of one scene at a birthday party. Poelvoorde gives a very good performance and is certainly the heart and soul of the movie. His comic timing hits the mark on most occasions but once again, a stronger screenplay would have helped. I know this film has become a cult favorite over the years and it's easy to see why so many people would love it but for me the thing just never really came together.

Think about that one for a second. Certainly in your long list of disappointments, there is bound to be a new release film you saw that didn't fit the awesome-amazing-godly vision you anticipated in your head. However, reading reviews of older films, I rarely see this term used. If someone dislikes an older film, they say something like It's just the most overrated movie of all time. But very rarely do I ever see anyone have the audacity to say an older film is completely worthless, then give an intelligent reasoning for their opinion, even if they were completely disappointed with the older film. Maybe this is because we as a society have some sort of ludicrous respect for older films, even when they don't deserve it. Though I was not completely disappointed with The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&#151;far from it&#151;I will give intelligent reasoning as to why those blind-eyed by nostalgia need to realize this film has not aged in golden perfection. Also, I'll try to help those who were completely disappointed with this film to understand why it isn't total trash.Because I lived in a semi-sheltered household, I didn't grow up on horror movies. In my recent years, I count this as a blessing, because I can review films without any nostalgic bias whatsoever. Nostalgia is the problem with so many reviews I read of this movie. Someone who saw The Texas Chain Saw Mass cure at the age of 5 and went in their pants is going to grow up proclaiming to the masses that it is THE scariest movie of all time! While, in opposite, a 20-year-old man viewing the film for the first time is going to say that Hostel was more terrifying than this cheesy crap! because Hostel is more modern and he can relate to it more. It's all a matter of perspective. Personally, I didn't see anything scary about this movie whatsoever. I can, however, see how someone would think that. Just because something is old and was effective to an older audience does not mean it's effective to a modern audience. If you want to live in absurd denial that The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is the scariest movie of all time, no exceptions, then may I ask who is being more immature you, or the kids you claim no nothing about horror? In the opposite spectrum, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is in the top 5 most important horror films of all time, like it or not. That isn't an opinion. In its time, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was a purely original idea, and to this day there has never been a film like it. While some will argue that it's far inferior to the superior remakes, they fail to see that the original was far more groundbreaking. The remakes strayed from the original plot and pumped it full of clichés. The original The Texas Chain Saw Massacre gave built a far more complete atmosphere and refused to explain any of the events that transpired in the film, except in the opening monologue. This is a far more original form of storytelling, and, to me, and most other people, is far more effective. It is inarguably more realistic.But what The Texas Chain Saw Massacre doesn't have is flawless production value. Compared to movies today, this is almost like watching an indie YouTube video. The production value has aged, and it's important to understand that. Hooper's directing is still very technical and well-done, but that just can't blot out the deeply aged edge. For example, it's very obvious that Hooper was trying to shoot for a PG-rating initially. The lack of on-screen gore is very annoying at times, because by today's standards, it's incredibly tame, even if it was on-screen. Also, the acting from the secondary characters is very unbelievable, even laughable, at points. I personally can appreciate all this lack of polish, because it's far more unsealing than the clean-cut politically-correct remakes.Overall, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre may not hold up to the blockbuster status, but it doesn't have to. It wasn't meant to. It was one of the first examples of pure, raw, anti-stylistic intensity captured on film. That's what its legacy is built around. That's why The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was so important in its time.Like it or not, find it cheesy or unnerving, find it scary or laughable, you can't deny that the film still has something that very few other movies&#151;modern or not&#151;don't have. Intensity. Uncertainty. Confusion. Originality. Even if you find the film purely disappointing, can you name a whole lot of other horror movies that have these characteristics?

He lives off the wealth of his father, Brian Madison, the owner of Madison Hotels. Brian is about to retire, and unfortunately, his son is not quite fit to take over the business. For this reason, he plans to give it to associate Eric Gordon instead. Billy then learns that throughout his years in school, his rich father paid for his passing grades, but this gives him an idea. He will go all the way back through grades 1 to 12, two weeks in each grade, and if he passes, he will inherit the business. His father agrees with this deal, and Billy is soon back in elementary school. As the weeks go by, despite his continuous immaturity, he seems to be doing well, but Eric Gordon is still determined to take over Madison Hotels himself, and is willing to sabotage the plan! This movie obviously relies mostly on Adam Sandler's antics for the humour, which can sometimes be funny. During my most recent viewing, the gag near the beginning with the main character chasing after a large, hallucinatory penguin didn't fail to make me laugh, and neither did other scenes where this penguin appears. However, there are definitely quite a few other gags that I did not care much for at all, such as Billy and his friends leaving a burning bag of feces on a guy's porch (and what Billy says as they watch), what Billy says when asked to spell couch, and the character convincing the class on a trip that its cool to wet your pants. Still, the hallucinatory penguin gags weren't the only ones that made me laugh. I also found Billy's comments on the book he is read to in Grade 1 funny, same with the main character showing up drunk at the door of Veronica Vaughn (his Grade 3 teacher, whom he has a crush on), with what he says to her when she answers, and what Billy's friends say as Veronica Vaughn is beating him up in the pool. Chris Farley in the small role of the bus driver is also good for laughs, if you're a fan of his.If you're in the mood for a perfectly clean, mature, sophisticated comedy, Billy Madison is basically the opposite kind of comedy, so you'd better steer clear! As I'm sure anyone who has seen this movie (as well as many who haven't) knows, it's a vulgar, juvenile, lowdown comedy, the type which many people hate. For me, comedies like this can be turn out to be really funny, but can also turn out to be really lame. I would say this particular comedy of that type comes somewhere in between. It's obviously not for those who hate Adam Sandler (he certainly has received his share of criticism during his career), but basically, it's a typical Sandler film, where he plays a goofy, immature lead (though that isn't the only kind of role he has played to date), for those who like that. It's certainly not his best film, and the puerile humour in it is sometimes overdone, but at least I can give it a passing grade, which is more than I can say about Sandler's 2002 animated flop, Eight Crazy Nights.

The first Flash Gordon comic strip is published. BIRTHS Hank Aaron. KEVIN What can be said about this seminal rom-com classic that hasn't already been said? This is one of only a couple of 1934 releases that we've seen previously. When we first rented it, we watched it twice before sending it back, which was extremely rare at the time. Even then, I wasn't exactly sure why it merited a second viewing. One of the many things I like about this movie is how it's one of those classic films that was never designed to be a classic. There was nothing particularly out of the ordinary about its production, and yet the planets aligned just right so that the end result swept the major awards at the Oscars for the first time ever. Even when you watch the movie, you're not likely to find anything unusual or innovative about the story and the characters, except that they are all top-notch. Both Gable and Colbert take their potentially bland roles and breathe beautiful life into them. Gable's struggling journalist Peter is kind of a jerk on paper, and not just because he's exploiting Ellie for a story. He seems to want to bring Ellie down a notch and give her a humbling lesson about common folk that she'll never forget. He insults Ellie and her upbringing in nearly every scene. He tells Ellie's father (played by the excellent Walter Connolly) that what Ellie needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her once a day, whether it's coming to her or not. But Gable's likability and charisma make Peter's undeniable love for Ellie (in the context of all that outward disgust) feel honest and not a contradiction. How is that even possible? Peter creates something of a monster in Ellie, who exceeds his bitter expectations when she metamorphoses from a spoiled, shut-in heiress to a spunky and resourceful heroine (re the limb is mightier than the thumb). Colbert hits just the right note to make Ellie likable and even at times relatable, yet never losing the sense that this is an upper-crust kind of girl. Then there's the chemistry, which crackles every moment they share the screen. These two probably bad-mouth each other more than they are ostensibly nice to one another, but the script drops in all those subtle hints that these two are really growing attached throughout their journey. The episodic storyline is perfectly paced. I don't think there is one scene that runs too long or too short in the entire film, and every character and subplot is paid off by the end. Frank Capra made a lot of perfect movies, and this one was the first of those.DOUG 1934 begins with Frank Capra becoming an A-list director while giving birth to the screwball comedy with It Happened One Night. Not bad, Frank. What's with that title, though? It has nothing to do with the movie. I'm not going to bother summarizing the plot, so I'll just get straight to the review When I first watched it some years ago, I thought Peter was a little too mean. I don't think that anymore (any girl with $2 her pocket who indulges in bus vendor snacks is in need of an escort), though he probably couldn't get away with some of the things he says or does today. The hitchhiking scene is my favorite, and not for the reason you think; It's Claudette Colbert's shining moment. After taking so much abuse from Peter, she finally gets to upstage him and make him look stupid. I can't believe this hasn't been remade a hundred times over. There's The Sure Thing, which follows the model, of course, but I'm surprised we haven't seen Hollywood do a literal remake, especially in this age of celebutante heiresses splashed all over the media.

For me, though, I really like it, even if I noticed some good bits, and not so impressive bits. The animation was actually excellent, like Charlie's dream. The characters were a mixed bag, the best being Anne-Marie, voiced by the late Judith Barsi.(I was physically ill when I read what happened to her) Also, Carface is a very convincing villain,especially voiced by the wonderful Vic Tayback(I particularly loved Morons I'm surrounded by Morons) and along with Rasputin and Warren T.Rat is probably the most memorable of all the Don Bluth villains. Charlie and Itchy only just lacked the same sparkle, but I loved King Gator and his song. Some of the film is very haunting, like Annabelle's You can never come come back, which kind of scares me still. Unfortunately, there were some bits I didn't like so much. The story had a tendency to become clumsy and unfocused, but Disney's Black Cauldron suffered from the same problem. Also there were some dark scenes, that young children would find upsetting, but the ending is very poignant. However the biggest flaw was the rather bland songs and the way they were sung. None of them in particular stick out, with exception of Let's Make Music Together and Love Survives, and Burt Reynolds can't sing and Dom DeLuise has done much better singing.

Sure it isn't the same as animation is now, but let's face it, most animation nowadays isn't very good. I can name a plethora of reasons why I love this movie. The animation is beautiful, with one or two stiff movements, but have a heart, it is the first Disney animation. The songs are mind-blowing, as well as the gorgeous incidental music(music similar to Great Expectations, 1946) that hardly anybody has mentioned. My favourite is Someday my Prince Will Come, I cry every time I hear it. The characters are legendary, and the writing is top notch. Who can forget those adorable dwarfs, who added such a lot to this movie. Snow White is the weakest character but I like her innocence very much, and about her singing voice...it sounds weak, but in real life it must have been strong, and let me explain why. The colouratura soprano Amelita Galli-Curci was given the praise a beautiful and limpid voice yet I heard it on cassette and it sounds quite quiet. It has nothing to do with the size of the voice, but the quality of the recording. The best character was the wicked queen, who had the most classic animation scene I have ever seen... when she turns into a hag, which freaked me out big time when I was about 9, like Malificent from Sleeping Beauty. To me the Queen is probably one of the scariest Disney villains ever. The scene at Snow White's coffin was heart-rending, and it was the music that made it so. All in all, a beautiful, funny and touching movie, and I can't believe some people hated this. 10\/10.
