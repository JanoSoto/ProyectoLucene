[{"date":"8 May 2007","score":"11 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":" Very few artists have done as much for the thriller genre in film as British director Alfred Hitchcock, who not only was a pioneer of many of the techniques that would become widely used nowadays, but also across his career he literally invented a great amount of the rules that would shape the genre. While his career didn't seem to have started on the best way (his first movie, The Pleasure Garden was a failure), after the success of The Lodger in 1927, Hitchcock would become one of the most popular young directors in the United Kingdom, and it wouldn't take him much to be recognized worldwide. That recognition came in 1934, when his thriller The Man Who Knew Too Much was released, becoming his most acclaimed and successful movie to date and the one that would make him to be noticed by Hollywood. Not only this movie would introduce Hitchcock to America, it would also introduce one of cinema's most important actors Peter Lorre.The Man Who Knew Too Much begins in Switzerland, where Bob and Jill Lawrence (Leslie Banks and Edna Best) are on a winter sports holiday with their teenage daughter Betty (Nova Pilbeam). The reason for their visit is that Jill competes in a target shooting competition, and a family friend, Louis Bernard (Pierre Fresnay) competes in a skiing event. During a dinner, Bernard is murdered by an unseen shooter, but before dying he informs the Lawrences about a conspiracy to kill an important diplomat in London. The Lawrences are confused at first by the spy's revelation, but soon the confusion becomes a preoccupation, as the conspirators have kidnapped their daughter Betty in order to keep them quiet. Now the Lawrences know too much, and that knowledge may cost them their daughters, but while unable to tell the police their situation, the couple decides to find their daughter themselves.The screenplay for The Man Who Knew Too Much was written by Edwin Greenwood and A.R. Rawlinson, although it was based on a story co-written by D.B. Wyndham-Lewis and Charles Bennett. While the writing of the film was a cooperative effort, it is Charles Bennett's style the one that's shown the most through the story. Bennett's plays and screenplays became the basis of many of the most representative Hitchcock thrillers, and one could say that along with the Master of Suspense, he shaped the genre in its early days. The Man Who Knew Too Much includes many of Bennett's trademarks such as criminal spies, their political conspiracies and the innocent people that are dragged unto them; all spiced up by a very British humor that makes the whole thing even more enjoyable.While by 1933 Hitchcock already had made several remarkable films, The Man Who Knew Too Much is probably the first of his movies that truly can be considered as an emblematic Hitchcock film, as his style is finally shaped in this movie. Taking the best of Wyndham-Lewis and Bennett's story, Hitchcock brings to life a captivating tale of adventure and mystery that literally takes its innocent characters to the darkest alleys of London. Visually, the movie is a joy, as with the excellent work by cinematographer Curt Courant, Hitchcock shows the influence of German expressionism in his work and creates wonderful images of striking contrast between light and shadows. His dominion of suspense shines in many scenes of the film, particularly in an impressive sequence that serves as climax of the movie, where Hitchcock takes full advantage of the introduction of sound to movies.The performances by the actors are of an excellent quality, with Leslie Banks leading the cast with his charming presence and very British wit. His ability to mix drama with comedy makes his character a very real and likable person, that portrays remarkably the everyman placed in an uncommon situation. While Banks truly makes a great job, the real star of the film is the amazing Peter Lorre as the leader of the conspirators. In this his first work in English, Lorre shows off his enormous talent and steals every single scene he appears in, a remarkable task considering this was his first movie in English and that he had to learn his lines phonetically. Edna Best is good, albeit nothing spectacular; quite the opposite are Frank Vosper and Nova Pilbeam, who make an amazing work considering their limited screen time. Hugh Wakefield has a very funny supporting role where he masterfully displays his talent for comedy.When most people hear about The Man Who Knew Too Much, the instant memory is often that of Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day trying to recover their kidnapped son in the 1956 version of the movie. That is because Alfred Hitchcock decided to remake this classic in color and with the benefits of being a more experienced filmmaker and having a bigger budget to do it. But even when the Master himself prefer the remake, personally I think that the original movie is the superior version. True, the 1934 version of The Man Who Knew Too Much is not a perfect film, it has an irregular pace (at times too slow, at times too fast) and its plot has some very unlikely situations; however, it has a great charm and a powerful style very difficult to ignore. It is certainly dated by today's standards, but while the remake is technically superior, this one has a heart.After making this movie, the Master's career would only go higher and higher, as the next year he would follow the success of this film with another legendary masterpiece, penned again by Bennett The 39 Steps. It has been quoted many times that Hitchcock named this underrated movie, the work of an amateur, as he stated his preference towards the 50s remake, but here I must disagree with the Master, as personally I think that this is the version of The Man Who Knew Too Much that should be seen. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 May 2007","score":"11 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":" Very few artists have done as much for the thriller genre in film as British director Alfred Hitchcock, who not only was a pioneer of many of the techniques that would become widely used nowadays, but also across his career he literally invented a great amount of the rules that would shape the genre.

This is one of the greatest movies ever made, a classic, and will be remembered forever.Plot Taxi Driver is about a man named Travis Bickle who is suffering from insomniac, loneliness, and maybe even a touch of post-traumatic stress disorder. He is also sick of the scum he sees on the streets every night on his taxi. This is a complex plot that needs to be payed attention to but is also one of the greatest stories ever told in film.Acting Along with the story, the acting is the strongest point of the film. Robert De Niro gives one of the best performance of his career(although it is nearly impossible to beat Raging Bull). His improvised lines such as the immortal words, You talking to me, show his ability to take a situation and make it realistic. He deserved an Oscar for this movie. Harvey Keitel also plays a pimp named Sport Matthew which is also a great and sick performance. Cybill Shepherd plays his potential girlfriend but I'm not giving anything away on that. Jodie Foster plays a controversial role as a 12 year old prostitute named Iris who Travis takes upon his shoulders to protect. Peter Boyle plays an elderly taxi driver who gives Travis advice.Genre\/Quality It is hard to say exactly what genre this film is in. I'll put it in drama but I really do not know what genre it could be called. The quality is also visibly very well done. A fantastic score written by the late Bernard Herrmann, musically shows the deepening madness of Travis Bickle and the music of mid century New York City, and the dull life of a man who never sleeps. The camera work is great, with a beautiful crane shot near the end.Overall this is one of the greatest films of all time.

The Haunting is a very well written intelligent thriller its slow paced most of the time and not a film you can afford to miss any of as you may find it hard to get back into and follow the story,so you need to watch it from the beginning all the way through to get the best out of it.There is no blood guts or gore no real violence just suspense and a few jumpy moments. The acting between the four actors is excellent and convincing.

Or perhaps she can't act? In her other movies she is similarly detached, i.e. unable to act. I guess this kind of underacting, or non-acting was suitable here, but that's not to say she's brilliant as some people think. The movie is again about kinkiness, Bunuel's favourite theme. Sex and sexual perversion, the hallmarks of European cinema.

The movie tells about 5 crooks, who are brought together for questioning because of a truck hijack in New York. This is followed by a period of events and eventually they all are left with a mission, which a criminal mastermind named Keyser Soze has arranged for them because they all have wronged Soze in certain points of their criminal careers. They have no other choice than do the mission, because they're obviously being blackmailed and also because they just simply have to pay back what they've done in the past. It doesn't go as planned and the whole story is told by one of the crooks, Roger 'Verbal' Kint. What really happened on the job and is there even a man named Keyser Soze?The screenplay's just amazing, the whole plot consists of twists that are just so surprising that it makes you stare at the emptiness leaving you dribbling all over the place like you were being in a some kind of a mental institution. It progresses in a definite flow, leaving you concentrating so much that you don't want to miss one second of the movie itself. It's interesting, it's exciting, it's thrilling and it's just brilliant. The directing compliments the whole screenplay, by being so witty that it feels like you were watching a real live action crime happening, having a very nice cinematography as a backup. Some of the angles and the ways how some things are shot is just so significant for the movie that it's just, like mentioned above, so brilliant.The music isn't beautiful and phenomenal in purpose to make you cry, it's in purpose of giving you a guaranteed entertainment and a thrilling motion picture experience, composed by John Ottman. I mean, the music's just so fitting that it gives you this specific familiar smile on your face which says Yeah, awesome, that's how you do it. Well, you get the point, it's the kind of music you want for a thriller, giving the movie that required thriller edge to it.Despite the amazing screenplay, the things that make this movie so fantastic are the characters and the role performances done by the actors. Taking for example the five crooks, there's the bad ass Michael McManus, played by Stephen Baldwin, who I haven't actually seen doing a better role performance than as McManus. Then there's the cold and intelligent Dean Keaton, played by Gabriel Byrne, who really fits for the role like a strawberry for a pancake. Then there's Fred Fenster, the associate of McManus and the one with the looks, played by Benicio Del Toro, who's always enjoyable, yet usually in a weird role. Then there's Todd Hockney, the explosions expert and the one who just doesn't give a damn about anyone, played by Kevin Pollack, doing one of his best role performances yet to date. And finally, there is Roger 'Verbal' Kint, a cripple man who is in no use for anyone, being irrelevant, wanting to be a better crook, played by Kevin Spacey, who also does one of his best (if not The Best) role performances yet to date. Spacey's just so good that he's the movie's essence. Those are a few characters to name, but there are a whole bunch of others, played by actors who are at their best, making the movie so fantastic in every aspect.All in all The Usual Suspects is a fantastic film everyone should see. It has some of the best story twists ever written to a motion picture, making you that mental institution patient right till the end titles, where you keep on being that patient until you wake up in the real world realising that the movie's a celebration of fantastic characters and actors, an amazing screenplay and superb directing.

The other problem with the film is that abolitionists are portrayed as out and out villains, only to be regarded with suspicion. During an opening scene, the son of John Brown is trying to free a black family. He plays his part as if he is a deluded, misguided and desperate criminal. The blacks when featured are simple caricatures. The film is soaked in racism. This film was made in 1940, over 70 years after the emaciation of the slave. It feels as if the American Civil War was continuing in 1940 unabated, as many blacks of this period lived in conditions equal or worse than those of the Civil War. Human rights, justice and equality as yet a dream.A certain review of the film claims that political correctness gone mad has caused a lack of appreciation of a good film. The reviewer also claims that the American Civil War could have been avoided, as the South would have emancipated the slave eventually. My view is all wars can be avoided; yet to deprive American History of it's most documented and romanticised war would be to hurt too many Historians and re-enactors.Finally all that can be said about Santa Fe Trail is that it is a bad film.

No disrespect to the director he really is good at his game....when he was doing old school Hong Kong flicks like hard boiled!

The action scenes were pretty much IMPOSSIBLE I seen tom pretty much risk his ass in ridiculous moments in this movie it made me wonder, I wish I can do that!! but then was hit with reality and physics.

No disrespect to the director he really is good at his game....when he was doing old school Hong Kong flicks like hard boiled! Mission Impossible 2 (aka Mi 2) was the long awaited and anticipated sequel to the 1996 sleeper blockbuster and based off the highly successful TV show also with the same name. But in all honestly, this movie didn't raise the bar it just made it worse and nearly almost screwed up this franchise if it wasn't for J.J. Abrams smart approach to the third installment. Tom Cruise returns as the now almost superhuman Ethan hunt who pretty much makes it clear that bullets can't touch him, he can scale mountains with his bare hands, perform flashy martial arts, and have time to woo the girl with his charms damn I'm surprise he's not playing the saxophone and surfing the stair rails blindfolded while shooting the bad guys left and right....wait a minute...I think he did do that!! The storyline is weak but simple, You see there's a virus that is capable of wiping out humanity and they gave it a code name Chimera (oooh Greek roman history lesson somewhere) but in other to fight against this virus a anti-virus was created code name Balerafont (cause even in viruses there are good verses evil battles!) so of course there's a race against time and they eventually needed someone who can get the job done but unfortunately superman\/Ethan was climbing mountains with bare hands and another partner a sexy thief by the name of Nya (Thandie Newton)..oh yeah I forgot his team of Luther and Billy Barty (did I mention that both characters are hardly seen as much in this movie) and who can bring these guys together than Hannibal himself (Anthony Hopkins) which I think the was only there cause they must of paid him a lot but the look on his face said he was pretty much bored in this film but you be the judge on that.Lets face it the story was sub par bad (due to bad and lack of script), the romantic kindling between Tom and Thandie's character was VERY much rushed and obviously typical to the movie goer, and the bad guys were pretty much whinny little babies that can't shoot straight for the life of them but yet Ethan aka. The batman can hide in the shadows make, one shot an explosive one every damn time, can pop wheelies and burn rubber on the side with his feet while riding a motorcycle at very high speeds...did I mention he can cook too!? John Woo's approach wasn't bent on intellect like the first one and third, you can see him trying but it failed in many areas I mean DAMN even Luther (Ving rhames) didn't get that much screen time it was like Woo was saying, screw the black man, I want super white guy flashing his pretty hair every chance he gets I mean its not like woo hasn't done that before (The big hit and pretty much ALL his Americanized movies). The action scenes were pretty much IMPOSSIBLE I seen tom pretty much risk his ass in ridiculous moments in this movie it made me wonder, I wish I can do that!! but then was hit with reality and physics. This movie is pretty much a stuntman's dream with the white dove even at the climax I felt really cheated being that I could of sworn I've seen the dual shootout before (face\/off) I could say more to why I didn't like this movie but I'm going to watch Mi 3 on DVD now and be reminded on what could of been done to part 2.

The effectiveness of Sean Connery's second outing FROM Russia WITH LOVE cannot be judged by how neat or how innovative it is as an action movie. FROM Russia WITH LOVE has since been dated as an action picture, but as a pure thriller, still effective after the Cold War has been said and done, this is possibly one of the very best 007 movies, and arguably a great influence on its genre. The second 007 film (Dr. No being the first). From Russia with Love is one of the best Bond films, but in this era, it's pretty hard to see why. Like I said, these Boond films are either still praised, or forgotten. I for one praise it as a classic, and I know many others still do. I'm sure those people (young and old) who saw this on the cinema, will remember it like it was yesterday. This film has contributed a lot, not just with future Bond entries, but also with other spy adventure\/thriller movies. Who would forget the famous knife on the shoe, Blofeld and his two agents, the other famous Q gadgets and so much more. From Russia of Love is well-considered a classic for those reasons and other more.Sean Connery gives his very exceptional performance as Bond, and the villains, gadgets, moments are as memorable to Hollywood as it is today.

When the film was announced I thought it was going to be rubbish because mostly films that are based on games are completely crap especially the ones made by Uwe Boll, but I still went to see it the first day when it came out in the UK and it was sooooo amazing. I was speechless after I seen the film, the story is truly original and one of the best thing about it is that the first 10 minutes was slow & peaceful but then it went really fast & relentless just like a roller-coaster going up slowly & zoomed down. Paul W. S. Anderson has proved that he is terrific writer & director because it is extremely difficult to create a story for a film that is based on a video game. Milla Jovovich was undoubtedly the best and I loved her red dress to bits, it definitely did suit her. Watching the film gives you a deep insight of the game e.g.When they had about 3 hours limited time to complete their mission.Every time they enter a new place it had to be checked and they had to make sure it's safe just like in every game.If they where trapped they had to find another way out.In the end Alice & Matt got out without killing all the zombies because Resident Evil is rather a puzzle game and killing is not necessary.The combination of action, horror & thriller is superb; they are my entire favourite genre. It had a lot of style and the use of advanced modern technology that is mostly I look for in a film, the Licker in the end was the icing on the cake. This is the only movie that I liked with zombies in it because most of them are stupid & boring especially House of the Dead, the zombies pop out of nowhere and attack people. In Resident Evil the creation of zombies was very sensible, the staff of the underground laboratory were infected by the T-Virus released into the air vent, after getting killed by the Red Queen to avoid any outside interference their dead bodies were reanimated. It is mentioned very clearly that why they need to feed, nothing like that has ever been in any film which makes the story original. Dialogues are also good my most favourite quote is You're all going to die down here from the Red Queen, she is one of the best characters along with Alice, Matt & Rain. Background music score is the best music possibly for any film I have ever heard it has heavy metal guitar for the fight scenes and very soft, eerie & sensational for the main title. I have the soundtrack CD and I bought it just for the background score without caring that the other tracks might be good or not but it did turn out to good. There is nothing more I can ask for in a film that makes it one of my all time favourite movies and there is never going to be another film based on a video game like this!

I have the soundtrack CD and I bought it just for the background score without caring that the other tracks might be good or not but it did turn out to good.

When the film was announced I thought it was going to be rubbish because mostly films that are based on games are completely crap especially the ones made by Uwe Boll, but I still went to see it the first day when it came out in the UK and it was sooooo amazing. I was speechless after I seen the film, the story is truly original and one of the best thing about it is that the first 10 minutes was slow & peaceful but then it went really fast & relentless just like a roller-coaster going up slowly & zoomed down. Paul W. S. Anderson has proved that he is terrific writer & director because it is extremely difficult to create a story for a film that is based on a video game. Milla Jovovich was undoubtedly the best and I loved her red dress to bits, it definitely did suit her. Watching the film gives you a deep insight of the game e.g.When they had about 3 hours limited time to complete their mission.Every time they enter a new place it had to be checked and they had to make sure it's safe just like in every game.If they where trapped they had to find another way out.In the end Alice & Matt got out without killing all the zombies because Resident Evil is rather a puzzle game and killing is not necessary.The combination of action, horror & thriller is superb; they are my entire favourite genre. It had a lot of style and the use of advanced modern technology that is mostly I look for in a film, the Licker in the end was the icing on the cake. This is the only movie that I liked with zombies in it because most of them are stupid & boring especially House of the Dead, the zombies pop out of nowhere and attack people. In Resident Evil the creation of zombies was very sensible, the staff of the underground laboratory were infected by the T-Virus released into the air vent, after getting killed by the Red Queen to avoid any outside interference their dead bodies were reanimated. It is mentioned very clearly that why they need to feed, nothing like that has ever been in any film which makes the story original. Dialogues are also good my most favourite quote is You're all going to die down here from the Red Queen, she is one of the best characters along with Alice, Matt & Rain.

Tomorrow Never Dies is just as good, if not better than,Goldeneye, and it was a much better effort than Pierce Brosnan's final role as Bond, Die Another Day. The plot is simple. Media mogul Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce) plots to create worldwide panic by creating real-life disasters and displaying them in his headlines. Bond is sent to stop him before he uses the world's forces against each other.The plot is very much the stuff TV serials involving megalomaniacs on prowl for world domination. But the film is very well done with style, that it's hard to disagree. Brosnan's performance is an exquisite combination of the suave and the tough. Pryce also delivers an top-notch performance as the maniacal Carver. As far as it goes, it has a great touch of realism, combined with a similar over-the-top, switch-your-mind-off action we have grown to love from the popular series.TOMORROW NEVER DIES is a suave, slick and entertaining comic thriller that returns to the sort of James Bond movie of THUNDERBALL and YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, the sort where the Bond matches brains and brawn with a megalomaniac who simply wants to take over the world. Don't expect much of a logical explanation. It's so busy and fast, there's no real time for that. But do expect some strong action, crisp dialog and, of course, Bond, James Bond!

Basically Professional daredevil and white-suited hero, The Great Leslie (Tony Curtis, like Peter Perfect) has a special car made to race from New York to Paris (westward across America, the Bering Straight and Russia) and help promote automobile sales. Leslie's arch-rival, the moustached and black-attired Professor Fate (Golden Globe nominated Jack Lemmon, like Dick Dastardly) with cohort Max (Columbo's Peter Falk, like Muttley, without wheezing snickering) vows to beat Leslie to the finish line in a car of Fate's own invention. The film was good, until I realised the length (20 minutes under 3 hours!), and they had to bring in a dragging thing with Fate fooling everyone to crown him a King, instead of the man who has a close resemblance, drunk Prince Hapnik (Lemmon, again). It does pick up again though with the pie fight, and Leslie loses on purpose, to Fate, to prove his love for companion Maggie DuBois (Natalie Wood). It is pretty much a live action cartoon, or episode of Wacky Races, with tributes to Laurel and Hardy. It won the Oscar for Best Sound Effects, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Song for The Sweetheart Tree (also nominated the Golden Globe) and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical\/Comedy and Best Original Score for Henry Mancini.
