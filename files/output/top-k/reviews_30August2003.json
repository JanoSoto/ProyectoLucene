The main story line is not that bad but the movie is full with dumb and completely unnecessary sub plots.

Sure it has some nice scenery but the special effects are pretty disappointing, especially in the beginning.Still the movie is not a complete wreck, it still has some nice and even exciting moments and the musical score by James Newton Howard is also surprising good and so is the excellent camera work from David Tattersall.

For Your Eyes Only was to be the 11th James Bond adventure, but the success of Star Wars had Cubby Brocoli make the decision to take the villain, title, and nothing else from the novel and send Bond into space. Cubby maintained in the production that it wasn't science fiction; it was science fact. But that isn't the case, and this film both isolates itself from the rest of the films AND seems tired.To begin with, the story is good. Very good. But it's hidden beneath everything else in the film. The ridiculous attempts at humor in the script make the film very boring, and the overall plot of the villain; destroying the world and then re-creating it; is a carbon copy of The Spy Who Loved Me and even more ridiculous. Space shuttles existed then, but a space station like that and a space program that organized wasn't even thinkable back in the 1970s, and it doesn't even exist today. With everything that goes on the film, you don't think of it as a Bond picture. It's either an elaborate, overly-dramatic science fiction film or a drama with some science fiction in it.Roger Moore again gives a tired performance, and the female lead; CIA agent Holly Goodhead, is again rather pathetic. Yes, she's an astronaut and scientist, and she can fight, but why couldn't she fight the goons who knocked her and James out? The acting by the person in the role isn't Bond quality. Jaws's return was un-needed and he could've easily become Bond's ally without the worthless, puny girlfriend. A lot of the suspense and intrigue at the beginning of the film looks and feels good, but because of the tired feel of the film and actors, it doesn't really work.The film is better than TSWLM, however. Special effects of this sort belong in Star Wars, not 007, but you could never tell that the filmmakers didn't actually go up into space and shoot real spacecraft. The models and rewound camera techniques are far more impressive and believable than any kind of CGI used in the new Star Wars films. The music is very beautiful. The interesting thing about this film and TSWLM is that, while the films are tired, the music is exciting, enchanting, and everything the film was supposed to be. We have good performances by Q and Moneypenny as usual, General Gogol and Fredrick Grey reappear, and we have a beautiful farewell performance from Bernard Lee as M. In his best performance as the head of MI6, Lee's final scene; seeing 007's love-making to Goodhead, is a bit of a copy-off of TSWLM, but he does it so well. No one can replace the original M, who died of cancer after filming. Hugo Drax is a very interesting villain, with a very interesting death.The film gets 5 and 3\/4 stars out of 10.

Space shuttles existed then, but a space station like that and a space program that organized wasn't even thinkable back in the 1970s, and it doesn't even exist today. With everything that goes on the film, you don't think of it as a Bond picture. It's either an elaborate, overly-dramatic science fiction film or a drama with some science fiction in it.Roger Moore again gives a tired performance, and the female lead; CIA agent Holly Goodhead, is again rather pathetic. Yes, she's an astronaut and scientist, and she can fight, but why couldn't she fight the goons who knocked her and James out? The acting by the person in the role isn't Bond quality. Jaws's return was un-needed and he could've easily become Bond's ally without the worthless, puny girlfriend. A lot of the suspense and intrigue at the beginning of the film looks and feels good, but because of the tired feel of the film and actors, it doesn't really work.The film is better than TSWLM, however. Special effects of this sort belong in Star Wars, not 007, but you could never tell that the filmmakers didn't actually go up into space and shoot real spacecraft. The models and rewound camera techniques are far more impressive and believable than any kind of CGI used in the new Star Wars films. The music is very beautiful. The interesting thing about this film and TSWLM is that, while the films are tired, the music is exciting, enchanting, and everything the film was supposed to be. We have good performances by Q and Moneypenny as usual, General Gogol and Fredrick Grey reappear, and we have a beautiful farewell performance from Bernard Lee as M. In his best performance as the head of MI6, Lee's final scene; seeing 007's love-making to Goodhead, is a bit of a copy-off of TSWLM, but he does it so well. No one can replace the original M, who died of cancer after filming. Hugo Drax is a very interesting villain, with a very interesting death.The film gets 5 and 3\/4 stars out of 10.

The effects is very good, the acting is good, the sets look very realistic, and the story is fantastic! Guy Pearce was good and I thought Orlando Jones was good. The music is extraordinary. The truth is I cried when this wonderful part was at the end credits. It starts when the credits say about Stan Winston Studios. It was of course in the film when Guy Pearce lost his necklace in the Time Machine. Also it is located on the original score track number six I don't belong here. It is really an emotional piece of music composed by Hans Zimmer's colleague Klaus Badelt! I really liked this short but epic picture. Great for time traveling movie fans!Movie Nuttball's NOTEThe following is in My opinions and My thoughts.This movie has an important message I believe. To make it short a person should appreciate life even if it isn't a perfect world. A person should look up at the sky and look at the moon and think how beautiful it looks and what ever time it is whether the sky is a twilight, a cloudy, or what ever kind of sky and thank the lord that he\/she can look at it. Us people should be very thankful that we have all of the great trees and animals to live together in the same world. The person should make life better for a better future just not for the person but for everyone around the person. We don't know how the future will be in several years or decades or even further. We should start and use ours minds and stop being cocky and thinking we know everything when we really haven't even begun to learn. Think about, We don't know what God and his heaven looks like. Heck, we don't even know all of the species of fish and other life forms in the ocean. Sure we humans have existed for thousands of years but how long have we had our great technology of today such as televisions. video games, and of course electricity.

The actors play it straight, as if they really were that stupid, so it comes off as genuine and not derogatory, and you develop an attachment to them just as they are. By minor players, I mean, the porn actors, because their lives were controlled by external forces, whereas the major players like Jack Horner and his financier were the ones in control.*** Spoiler Alert ***When Eddie's mom tears into him with her You're stupid! tirade, it was so well done, I wanted him to hit her, she was so mean. And it made it easy to see how he would have gone into something like porn, but it wasn't preachy about it. More like, here's what happened and what this particular guy did as a result.Same with the cocaine. It wasn't a preachy anti-drug thing, but bad things really did happen to people who overdid cocaine, and these characters were able to pull out of it and get their lives back on track.I thought the way Buck Swope found redemption was little facile, and it's pretty hard to believe that there would have been enough money in that safe to finance his business. However, isn't it interesting that whenever someone in a movie goes to a convenience store at night, bad stuff is bound to happen?Also, I didn't like the way the ending was so happy.

That would have made it a masterpiece, if the remaining characters had been able to find love and redemption and some kind of inner peace in the face of imponderable sadness.But then, the final scene was Eddie Adams looking at his huge member in the mirror to give himself a pep talk, so I guess something like the depth of emotion of the end of The Deer Hunter would have been inappropriate.

By minor players, I mean, the porn actors, because their lives were controlled by external forces, whereas the major players like Jack Horner and his financier were the ones in control.*** Spoiler Alert ***When Eddie's mom tears into him with her You're stupid! tirade, it was so well done, I wanted him to hit her, she was so mean. And it made it easy to see how he would have gone into something like porn, but it wasn't preachy about it. More like, here's what happened and what this particular guy did as a result.Same with the cocaine. It wasn't a preachy anti-drug thing, but bad things really did happen to people who overdid cocaine, and these characters were able to pull out of it and get their lives back on track.I thought the way Buck Swope found redemption was little facile, and it's pretty hard to believe that there would have been enough money in that safe to finance his business. However, isn't it interesting that whenever someone in a movie goes to a convenience store at night, bad stuff is bound to happen?Also, I didn't like the way the ending was so happy. Nobody had to pay for their sins, which were pretty egregious for some. Like Rollergirl smashing a guy's skull with her skates, and then not much later being admonished to clean her room by Daddy Horner. And what about Buck taking the money and not getting caught? Excuse me, but I seem to recall surveillance cameras even in the distant past of the 1980's.The ending brought humanity to the whole story, with so many broken, damaged people finding a kind of salvation and love, however twisted, under Horner's wing, but I think it would have been better with a little more anguish. That would have made it a masterpiece, if the remaining characters had been able to find love and redemption and some kind of inner peace in the face of imponderable sadness.But then, the final scene was Eddie Adams looking at his huge member in the mirror to give himself a pep talk, so I guess something like the depth of emotion of the end of The Deer Hunter would have been inappropriate.

That William Rose won an Oscar for his simplistic screenplay is NOT one of the Academy's finer moments, but in terms of performance, Spencer Tracy would prove, one last time, why he was America's finest film actor.The backstory of the film is fascinating; by 1960, Tracy's health had become so poor, after a lifetime of alcohol abuse, that studios were unwilling to hire him. Stanley Kramer stepped in, and courageously cast the actor in INHERIT THE WIND, JUDGMENT IN NUREMBERG, and, finally, in IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD. Sadly, Tracy's deteriorating condition was painfully obvious in the 1963 comedy, and he soon suffered a series of health setbacks that left him nearly bedridden. Katharine Hepburn put her own career on hold to nurse the ailing actor, with whom she'd had a relationship for over twenty years, and she watched as the enforced inactivity slowly killed him. Going to Kramer, the pair worked out a scheme to get Tracy back on his feet and acting again, knowing that while the effort might kill him, it would let him 'go out' in the manner he preferred. Kramer visited the ailing actor with the script for GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER, explaining how his part could be filmed with a minimum of risk to his health, with his beloved 'Kate' at his side, and her niece, Katharine Houghton, making her film debut...and that he had already cast Sidney Poitier, the greatest black actor in Hollywood, to co-star. He then visited Poitier, showed him the script, and told him he'd already gotten Tracy and Hepburn to commit to the project! The ruse worked, with both Tracy and Poitier agreeing to make the film.There was still a last hurtle to cross; no insurance company would underwrite a film with Tracy, because of his health. Kramer and Hepburn worked out an agreement, that both would sacrifice their salaries, if Tracy died during the production. The underwriters agreed to those terms, and filming began.It was a happy, if careful, 'shoot', with Tracy's biggest scenes, including the long 'testimonial' speech the film is best known for, shot first. At the completion of his last scene filmed (when he and Hepburn order ice cream, in their car), cast and crew gave the actor a standing ovation, and Tracy was visibly moved. He would pass away just days later, but Hepburn was right; he went out the way he wanted to, on film.Both Tracy and Hepburn were nominated for Oscars for the film; while his was certainly deserved, her role wasn't really that large or demanding. Yet on Oscar night, she won the statuette, which she graciously accepted as being for 'both' of them. A year later, she'd match Tracy's 'back-to-back' Oscar achievement, by winning for her brilliant performance as Eleanor, in THE LION IN WINTER.GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER is not a great movie, and it has not stood the test of time nearly as well as Tracy and Hepburn's other pairings.

I had heard so much positive feedback from others who had seen it, that I figured it would at least be worth my time.Sadly to say, that was not so.  I found the plot extraordinarily convoluted (even for a sci-fi film), felt that character's roles were underdeveloped, and given the fact that I felt it had already reached it's climax at 2 hours into the film doesn't speak very well for the remaining 30 minutes that followed.  These are just some of the items I will focus on below.For starters, one piece of advise to Spielberg  you have achieved your goal of making some of the finest and most profitable films in history.  Don't let that clout go to your head anymore and insist on making garbage like this.  If you are going to film more movies where you lay down the law for the characters like (spoiler) do not take the bandages off for twelve hours or you will go blind, then make sure you follow through and make them blind for doing so.

If she really could see the future as far as their son was concerned (at the house), then wouldn't that mean that she could see Cruise's future too and know that all would work out ok?  Oh yeah, that's because they still had no clue how to end the movie until they were at it's doorstep.  That just to let you know, means that they were inconsistent with the plot-line.  Very convoluted.  Bad move.But that's just one example.  There were many other parts that were in violation of the trust the film-goer gives the filmmaker in order to enjoy the set-up.  Too bad there's not enough here for those other examples.Then there was the performances.  I'll just focus on Colin Ferrel's. Nice and all, but hey, all of a sudden (spoiler #3) we're killing him off near the end after barely having any screen time in the movie.  Why?  I guess to make the bad guy look even more bad.  I personally didn't catch any real motivation from the bad guy in the movie, so if there is anyone else that did, please remember and tell me if I ever bump into you on the street. Good thing for him, he didn't need this role to show he's a great actor. Thank goodness!  (PS, I used to have enough trust in Spielberg that if I saw something like a (spoiler #4) bloodpack under an actor's shirt after being shot, then that meant that he wanted us to know that the character really wasn't dying, only that he was maybe fooling the person that shot him making him think that he died.  But then he did die.  Made me very confused.  I guess the days of Spielberg being very careful about his filmmaking techniques are over.)As far as the length goes, holy crap, I was so ready for it to be over after Cruise realized he was set up, that the remaining half-hour dragged on so slow, I kept asking my wife Is it over yet?
