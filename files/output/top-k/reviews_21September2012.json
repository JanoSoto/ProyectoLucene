The visual darkness of this movie recalls Fincher's earlier film 'Se7en', which also starred Fincher regular Brad Pitt.The Narrator (who remains unnamed throughout the course of the film but who is played by Edward Norton in a wonderfully neurotic performance) is an insomniac office worker who feels as though he is a slave to corporate ideals and senses that his humdrum life has no meaning. Things change drastically via a chance meeting with an anarchist soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Together, the two men channel their latent male aggression by forming a primal 'fight club' which meets on a regular basis in the dank basement of a seedy bar named Lou's Tavern.

The violence depicted here is stomach-churning and horrific, and this is precisely how violence SHOULD be presented on screen. This is, after all, what real violence is like.'Fight Club' has become a cult classic and rewards repeat viewings. The source material - Chuck Palahniuk's 1996 novel - is an excellent read shot through with a dark vein of black humour. Returning to the film, particular mention should go to British actress Helena Bonham Carter, who is wonderful as the bonkers Marla Singer, a suicidal woman who is sucked into Tyler's world. Carter made her name in period pieces like 'A Room With a View' and 'Howards End' so it is exciting to see her play a very different role here. And she has great fun with it.I sense that 'Fight Club' is going to live for a long, long time. For a mainstream film, it is intelligent, vital, and has a great deal to say about modern society and the way we live our lives.

Such an awful story for kids. Keeping children (and adults) in inboxed thinking in regard to how our society (world) should run even with magical properties. I watched the movie up to a point when Harry wins quidditch game and I couldn't watch itanymore... Basically, the whole story is a sheer expression of our deeply corrupted society, stuffed up with dangerously uneducated ideas and values. Obviously the author who wrote the book has no clue in the subjects of healthy and sustainable education or bio-psycho-social development of a child etc. The whole movie is filled up with corrupted uneducated misunderstandings. This story copies and perpetuates all social bullshits we have in our society. It is a dangerous and uneducated disinformation brainwashing kids how the life should be. First. The story starts with Harry living in pathological family. Indeed, it must had been magic that saved him from his psychological and emotional traumas and underdevelopment caused by his family's abusive treatment. Being locked up in closet under stairs all his life and being constantly emotionally and physically abused. It is really a miracle he grew up to be a completely stable kid. Of course it is impossible in real life but well it's a story about magic so... Anyway... Second. Harry ends up in Diagon Valley which is nothing else but wizard's supermarket saturated with magical consumerist crap. Harry doesn't have money to buy things so he needs to go to a bank to pick some stash up... Obviously even the realm of wizards is built upon primitive and obsolete ideas of monetary system with it's banking social parasitism... There is also a class division. Harry as being a rich one (inherited fortune from his parents) buys some sweets to share with his poor friend Ron Weasley. Well, I suppose wizards are not of that very smart kind to be able to figure out how to create their realm without monetary and social manipulation and inequality... After that Harry arrives in Hogwarts. Right at the main door an awfully cold, unsympathetic and abrupt teacher who looks like an old miserable hag indoctrinates kids with awful school rules. She scares them by warnings and tells them that they will be judged all the time for all their performance. She threatens them that they must be mindlessly obedient or they will be punished. She preaches teach them that they need to compete with others to acquire points. Schools principal even threatens kids with death if they will let themselves go to restricted areas. The whole Hogwarts looks like a typical brainwashing boarding school - an indoctrination camp for kids. Even the food kids eats look like a typical consumerist junk food with With only difference that their diet is fulled up with terribly hyperindulging amounts of greasy fast food type of meat dishes and oversugared sweets. The school is divided to 4 different houses - idea which perpetuates competition and inequality between kids even more. This teaching is an exact expression of how our educational system works. Instead of teaching kids compassion, understanding, creativity, connection and cooperation they teach children competition, mindless obedience and memorizing. Teaching full of judgmental, textbook tests and enormous psychological stress destroying all the remaining creativity and free thinking. Later Harry gets enrolled to quidditch game which is nothing else but a typical sport competition. It seems to be a wizard equivalent of rugby - Bullshit idea of competition is perpetuated once again. One house in the school is forced to compete against the other in a brutal aerial show for the cheering mass of teachers and brainwashed kids. Players brutally fight by kicking, hitting and pushing each other while trying to score points... One of kids get badly hit by a ball, loses control over his broom, falls and hits the ground and gets himself knocked out unconscious... After that moment I had enough of all this awful crap.

We have watched it several times! It is one of the best family movies I have ever seen! It has EVERYTHING humour, adventure, love, cute and funny characters, very good animation, stirring music and dancing, perfect understanding for children, and some deeper truths as well...I think - unfortunately - that very many children of today can relate to cute little Lilo's situation, as an only child to a single mum. As this is Disney, of course the single mum is not her real mother but her big sister, and of course their parents were married but died in an accident. But in reality, I think the movie wants to picture the typical single mum-situation. And also a lot of single mums, who fight to make ends meet and keep the social workers off, who threaten to take their children away - can relate to the situation.I also like it, that one gets an insight into the culture and life of the local people in Hawaii. It was innovative, I think, to let the main characters have the typical looks of the original inhabitants of the islands. Normally when the hula-hula girls are pictured in movies, they are played by white, Caucasian women.The part about spaceships and aliens was the least interesting in the movie, according to both my daughter and me. Although they made some funny jokes out of that too, such as the planet Earth being used as a breeding ground for mosquitoes (!), and the social worker who had previously been one of the Men in Black from CIA (if I got that joke right..?)! -) I warmly recommend this movie for families with children in all ages - and especially mothers and daughters!

It is one of the best family movies I have ever seen! It has EVERYTHING humour, adventure, love, cute and funny characters, very good animation, stirring music and dancing, perfect understanding for children, and some deeper truths as well...I think - unfortunately - that very many children of today can relate to cute little Lilo's situation, as an only child to a single mum. As this is Disney, of course the single mum is not her real mother but her big sister, and of course their parents were married but died in an accident. But in reality, I think the movie wants to picture the typical single mum-situation. And also a lot of single mums, who fight to make ends meet and keep the social workers off, who threaten to take their children away - can relate to the situation.I also like it, that one gets an insight into the culture and life of the local people in Hawaii. It was innovative, I think, to let the main characters have the typical looks of the original inhabitants of the islands.
