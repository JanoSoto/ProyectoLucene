[{"date":"24 May 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Wes Andersons' masterpiece Rushmore is a brilliant look into the mind of an adolescent.  Our main character, Max Fisher, is not doing well in school.  Sure he may start up such clubs as Rushmore bee keepers and write award winning plays such as Serpico but he just can't keep the grades up because he is to preocuppied with life to even biggen on his school work. First, he is in love with a teacher named Mrs. Cross that is nearly 15 years older then he is.  Max will have intellegent conversations with Mrs. Cross, but then he will go up to some one and say that he just recieved a hand job from her.  Max is also in another relationship, with Mr. Blume who is a rich man in his 50's.  Mr. Blume and Max become best friends and this is perhaps the most important relationship in the whole movie until Mr. Blume starts seeing Mrs. Cross and all hell brakes loose. Every single actor in Rushmore turns in an A performance.  Let's start with Jason Schartzman.  This kid is a talent to be recconded with.  And he definetly should have won some sort award for this performance.  There are tons of teen actors out there and Schartzmans the best.  Even in terrible movies like Slackers, he dosen't dissapoint.  I'd love to see him work with Wes again, and there is a rumor that they actualy are going to.  A round of applause for Bill Murray as Mr. Blume.  One of the best lines in the film is when Max asks You were in Veitnam if I'm not mistaken Mr. Blume replys Yeah  Max then asks Were you in the s**t?  and Bill Murray gives such a melecoly answers to a question so many war veterans fear.  And you beleive that some one could give an answer like that by the way he says it.  Oh yeah, not to menchion the look on his face. Wes Anderson is a genuis.  Even Owen Wilson, who's movies I was never a big fan of have an amazing script.

The whole setup zips along through each character from the brilliance of their childhood to the immobility of adulthood.  Gene Hackman has one of his most juiciest rolls ever.  In Royal Tenenbaum, Gene gets to let out some fog and crankiness with a smile. Brilliant casting job!I think the movie should have kept the cream puff tone through the end. Towards the second half, I felt it strayed too far into uncomfortable territories unnecessarily.  Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson have a gift for dialogue and genuinely funny situational comedy with some good deadpan. Wes brings a real freshness to film with his complex characters blended with music and retro style.  Bravo to a surging talent.
