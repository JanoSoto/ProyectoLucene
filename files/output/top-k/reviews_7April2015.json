After his passing, and a great killer line, a request if you will from Koteas, who was an avid admirer of Hobbs, though of course, not reciprocated, the same style of killings begin again. Now we venture into the world of the supernatural, and the why's as we look for a picture, then another big picture, another reason, then another reason, the story stringing us along successfully, in a want to know, why some New York city folk, strangers are acting creepy, towards Hobbes. And they're not just strangers, they're people in his unit. Hobbes is also seeing things, where the touch of one hand to another reaches Hobbes. Is it Koteas's spirit? The movie really puts too much into it, layer upon layer, as if to explain or keep the plot interesting while progressing the story more, ridiculously defending what we can't buy, every time, where in the end what ensues isn't earth shattering, but just ridiculous, more puff. The performances by all are good, James Gandofini for one, and Penelope Ann Miller, is it, who knows a lot about demons, and the church. She assists Hobbes to try and fight this spirit and properly rid Koteas of the universe for all. Fallen just joins those serial killer films of lower status or misfires, e.g, In Dreams, or the ridiculous Twisted, yet still the story does reel you in, having us wanting to know the truth behind's Hobbes's suffering. You won't suffer much during the film, but there will be some trying moments.

This was the first time my teachers had addressed the issue of discrimination and we were able to, as a class, openly discuss about it. I was excited to see that this intriguing tale came to life in a movie! To Kill A Mockingbird is set in Alabama in the 1930's. The film was released in 1962 however, and it is interesting enough that this was also a time of major movement for civil rights in America. In the movie, Atticus Finch is a young attorney with two young children, Jem and Scout, and he chooses to defend a black man who was being accused of raping a white woman. Although this sounds like a horror story, this was actually a major issue during this time. Whites were falsely accusing black men of things they were completely innocent for primarily because of the increasing use of discrimination. Discrimination was becoming increasingly more common during the 1950's and 60's because of many new reforms against segregation. Blacks were gradually rising up against the white for equality, Although it was working, whites (especially in the south) were so angry with these changes that they would do anything to put a black man away for good even if the man was completely innocent. This was a crazy time period in our American history and To Kill A Mockingbird greatly reflects on those issues. To Kill A Mockingbird is hands-down a must-see film! It is such an incredible story that every American should hear and understand... To me, it really grasps the idea of how times used to be and also goes to show how things have changed. It fascinates me how much progress we have made in America concerning equality among blacks and whites. I would recommend this film to everyone!!!

This is ridiculous, of course - remember when you were a kid and 'like' or 'don't like' was a binary option? - but when everybody else is so convinced that this is a 10\/10 masterpiece, there's always an urge to justify, even if only to yourself, why it's only worth 6, 7, or 8 to you.My own justification comes in two parts. Firstly, I find it very hard to identify with any of the characters in this film in any meaningful way. There are flashes of brilliance from McMurphy that have me on his side - the fake insanity after his electroshock therapy being the pick of the bunch - but for the most part his entire attitude to his situation is too self-defeating for me to support him (it's tough to cheer somebody on when you know they're ultimately being stupid). The Chief exacerbates this by being, on one hand, the most intelligent and sensible person on the ward, making McMurphy look worse in comparison - on the other though, he may be the most inexcusable (his silence implies a kind of selfishness, and if he's on the ward voluntarily, which is never made quite clear, then his existence and motives become hard to rationalize). Everybody else is just too crazy or irrelevant, except for Nurse Ratched.Nurse Ratched is the biggest problem, because as far I'm concerned she's the most sympathetic character in the entire movie. I'm actually shocked to learn that she's meant to be the 'bad guy' - she's no hero, don't get me wrong, but I thought the entire point of the film was to be ambiguous, to keep it a mystery whether or not The Chief and McMurphy are actually crazy and whether or not the system has failed them. Apparently not, if the bulk of the reviews I've read are to be believed, and that has to be a failing. She's meant to be the character you end up hating, and to me she's a woman doing an impossible job as best she can, while dealing admirably with more crap than anybody should ever have to put up with in their 9-5. The scenes that are meant to show 'humiliation' of the patients (other people's words, not mine) strike me as nothing of the sort; that's just what group therapy's like, isn't it? Even the great event that's meant to drive your hatred home merely highlights the ambiguity of the film for me - Billy's suicide is apparently meant to be something you blame on Ratched, but as far as I'm concerned, the guard and McMurphy are both just as guilty as Ratched is.I guess what I'm trying to say is that I felt more anger towards Ben Stiller in Happy Gilmore.The second problem is casting. Now, I accept that this is probably a harsh thing to judge a film on years after the fact, but it feels like every actor here has gone on to be in roles that are either greatly exaggerated parodies of what they do here (Jack Nicholson), or are just straight-up more memorable (Danny DeVito), or both (Christopher Lloyd). My fault for not seeing this first, I guess, but it's hard to take the plight of mental health seriously when it's presented to you by Doc Brown from Back to the Future, Jack from The Shining, the biology teacher from Fast Times at Ridgemont High, and any number of Danny DeVito characters. It's not that they're been in other roles that's the problem, or even that they've been in better roles - it's that the enforced, hammy wackiness of their later careers makes their performances in this film much less poignant by comparison. (Is it a co-incidence that Chief and Ratchet, the two 'straight' characters, are the only ones that I didn't instantly know from another film?) That, I suppose, is forgivable, but what's less easy to overlook is that Nicholson and Louise Fletcher are the most visually unremarkable people in the film. You're meant to be focusing on them and their power struggle, and instead your eyes can't help but drift to the likes of Chief, Billy, or Max because they all have instantly recognisable faces of physiques. On paper it's a great ensemble cast, but they take the shine off each other a little.It's still a very good film though, despite this. The apparently accidental ambiguity I've been referring to makes it a compelling watch, as the natural urge to find some kind of obvious, conclusive side to choose or to work into an obviously happy or sad ending is never resolved. It's a film that presents death - twice - in a way that's tragic but little else, which avoids Hollywood's normal obsession with making it either heroic, or deserved, or making it a vital launchpad for the storyline. Here, it happens and then that's pretty much it - I don't necessarily think the film would be any different without those deaths, and I like that. It's another facet of this film's greatest strength; it asks big questions, puts you in very awkward moral and societal positions, then leaves you to figure it out yourself.

This is ridiculous, of course - remember when you were a kid and 'like' or 'don't like' was a binary option? - but when everybody else is so convinced that this is a 10\/10 masterpiece, there's always an urge to justify, even if only to yourself, why it's only worth 6, 7, or 8 to you.My own justification comes in two parts. Firstly, I find it very hard to identify with any of the characters in this film in any meaningful way. There are flashes of brilliance from McMurphy that have me on his side - the fake insanity after his electroshock therapy being the pick of the bunch - but for the most part his entire attitude to his situation is too self-defeating for me to support him (it's tough to cheer somebody on when you know they're ultimately being stupid). The Chief exacerbates this by being, on one hand, the most intelligent and sensible person on the ward, making McMurphy look worse in comparison - on the other though, he may be the most inexcusable (his silence implies a kind of selfishness, and if he's on the ward voluntarily, which is never made quite clear, then his existence and motives become hard to rationalize). Everybody else is just too crazy or irrelevant, except for Nurse Ratched.Nurse Ratched is the biggest problem, because as far I'm concerned she's the most sympathetic character in the entire movie. I'm actually shocked to learn that she's meant to be the 'bad guy' - she's no hero, don't get me wrong, but I thought the entire point of the film was to be ambiguous, to keep it a mystery whether or not The Chief and McMurphy are actually crazy and whether or not the system has failed them. Apparently not, if the bulk of the reviews I've read are to be believed, and that has to be a failing. She's meant to be the character you end up hating, and to me she's a woman doing an impossible job as best she can, while dealing admirably with more crap than anybody should ever have to put up with in their 9-5. The scenes that are meant to show 'humiliation' of the patients (other people's words, not mine) strike me as nothing of the sort; that's just what group therapy's like, isn't it? Even the great event that's meant to drive your hatred home merely highlights the ambiguity of the film for me - Billy's suicide is apparently meant to be something you blame on Ratched, but as far as I'm concerned, the guard and McMurphy are both just as guilty as Ratched is.I guess what I'm trying to say is that I felt more anger towards Ben Stiller in Happy Gilmore.The second problem is casting. Now, I accept that this is probably a harsh thing to judge a film on years after the fact, but it feels like every actor here has gone on to be in roles that are either greatly exaggerated parodies of what they do here (Jack Nicholson), or are just straight-up more memorable (Danny DeVito), or both (Christopher Lloyd). My fault for not seeing this first, I guess, but it's hard to take the plight of mental health seriously when it's presented to you by Doc Brown from Back to the Future, Jack from The Shining, the biology teacher from Fast Times at Ridgemont High, and any number of Danny DeVito characters. It's not that they're been in other roles that's the problem, or even that they've been in better roles - it's that the enforced, hammy wackiness of their later careers makes their performances in this film much less poignant by comparison. (Is it a co-incidence that Chief and Ratchet, the two 'straight' characters, are the only ones that I didn't instantly know from another film?) That, I suppose, is forgivable, but what's less easy to overlook is that Nicholson and Louise Fletcher are the most visually unremarkable people in the film. You're meant to be focusing on them and their power struggle, and instead your eyes can't help but drift to the likes of Chief, Billy, or Max because they all have instantly recognisable faces of physiques. On paper it's a great ensemble cast, but they take the shine off each other a little.It's still a very good film though, despite this. The apparently accidental ambiguity I've been referring to makes it a compelling watch, as the natural urge to find some kind of obvious, conclusive side to choose or to work into an obviously happy or sad ending is never resolved. It's a film that presents death - twice - in a way that's tragic but little else, which avoids Hollywood's normal obsession with making it either heroic, or deserved, or making it a vital launchpad for the storyline. Here, it happens and then that's pretty much it - I don't necessarily think the film would be any different without those deaths, and I like that. It's another facet of this film's greatest strength; it asks big questions, puts you in very awkward moral and societal positions, then leaves you to figure it out yourself.

Then they have to destroy the mighty twin guns up in the hills that blight the British operations on the Aegean waters. Adapted from the Alistair MacLean novel, it's directed by J. Lee Thompson and stars Gregory Peck, David Niven, Anthony Quinn, Anthony Quayle, Stanley Baker and James Darren. Music is scored by Dimitri Tiomkin and cinematography by Oswald Morris. Watching it now it seems oh so very formulaic, but it was rarely the norm back than for war films to always follow this brand of high end adventure staples. The makers take a bunch of men from the various social spectrum and thrust them together for an impossible mission. We have the stiff backed guys with moral reasoning at their core, the rough and tumble men, all face fuzz and machismo seeping from every pore, and a young baby faced youngster blossoming into a man by the day. They will be put through the mangler at regular intervals, faced with scenarios to test their metal, all while the group view each other with suspicions of motives and reasonings. Here the character sub-plots, their hang-ups and frets, do not bog down the fun or the excitement, they enhance the narrative. We also get two ladies entering the group (Irene Papas\/Gia Scala), and they too add some meat into an already beefy stew. Action is a plenty, suspense equally so. While of course there's twists and turns to input some mystery and pot boiling character dynamics. Elsewhere, Tiomkin provides a robust Golden Globe Winning score, and Bill Warrington & Chris Greenham's special effects won the Academy Award in that department; they look at times a bit weak now, but who cares right? The array of screen work, matte paintings and miniatures blend superbly with the outdoor location photography, which points us to a time when film makers worked their socks off to create the magic up there on the screen. Oh and the scripted dialogue, just wonderful and beating an intelligent heart.

For years I heard about how great this film was and how much people loved it. I was already a huge sci-fi fan, so I was thrilled that I was getting see a sci-fi movie that I wanted to see for a while. Nothing could go wrong! Then I watched it... I was underwhelmed at first. I didn't fully understand everything that was going on. So I watched the features. The documentaries that came with the film. Later on, I watched the film again with the Ridley Scott commentary. I understood the movie now, but other than that nothing had changed. I didn't like it any more or any less than I did before. A few weeks later I try watching again, and nothing. The movie itself may not overrated per se, but I don't what makes it so special.The music. One of the things I can say I dislike about Blade Runner is its score. It's very noir in its presentation. Which would make perfect sense because the movie is a very noir like film.Sets and effects. I do like the look of the city, the vehicles, and the interior of the buildings. It's very unique and custom to the film. The inside of Deckard's apartment is one of my favorites. And the cars. The cars are so friggin cool to see hover up into the air or land on the street. Definitely top notch stuff there.Characters. My absolute favorite thing about Blade Runner - Roy Batty. The film's main antagonist, a replicant, played flawlessly by Rutger Hauer. Terrifying yet fascinating, Roy Batty has steadily climbed my list of favorite villains since my multiple viewings of Blade Runner. Rick Deckard. Not my favorite Harrison Ford character, but far from my least favorite. He's not Indiana Jones or Han Solo, he's something very different, but it works. Pris. Daryl Hanah's replicant character is extremely iconic and the visual of her as Pris is something that always pops in my mind when I think of Blade Runner. Sultry and seductive but always dangerous, Pris is my second favorite character in the movie.At the end of the day Blade Runner is middle of the road for me. I didn't hate it, but I can't exactly say I liked it either. I've watched it a total six times now, so believe me, I tried. I really tried to like it overall.

This is the real thing. The wide-sweeping vistas of desert wilderness are not special-effects; they are REAL. And they look real. Long views, sweeping pans and takes sustained over minutes are realised with a clarity, colour and vividness that absolutely melt your heart.

Every second is worth seeing and every word worth hearing. And its theme music is as iconic as the man himself.The inimitable Peter O'Toole with his blonde hair, steely-blue eyes, haunting expressions and mood swings, commands your attention in every take. His Lawrence is a man swallowed up by a personal sense of destiny, striding between his cynical and prosaic taskmasters and a doomed belief in what might be achieved with superhuman effort. Omar Sharif never played a better role as foil to his capricious hero. Unusually, there are no leading ladies. And they're certainly not needed. A love interest would have cheapened the entire presentation. Here is a story about the romance of time and place.
