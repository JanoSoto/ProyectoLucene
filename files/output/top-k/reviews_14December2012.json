In relation to this movie and also to Dick, I have had people simply promote both to no end, Dick as a visionary, and this movie as demonstrating the idea of human sin and redemption. Look, in our Western society, the narrative of sin and salvation has been passed down for the last two thousand years, the the idea is not so much that we sin, but that others sin against us and that we desire to go to no end to protect ourselves from that sin.This is where this film comes in. America is a very violent nation, with a huge murder rate, even today. However, three unusual people were discovered that could predict a murder before it happened, and a special unit was established to use this information to prevent murders. As such there has been no murder in Washington DC for at least six years, but the question really does come down to what is the cost, and also whether such premonitions can be actually used to convict somebody of a crime.The idea of an attempt is always a grey legal area where there is no clear cut answer. A man walking into a shop with a gun, pointing it at the clerk, and demanding money but not getting any for whatever reason, is an attempt that is pretty clear cut. However a group of stoned teenagers joking about robbing a bank, and even coming up with a plan, but not putting it into execution, is a completely different story. This is where the grey area of this film comes in, because too much faith is based upon the accuracy of these pre-cogs. The main character, days before actually committing the murder, is put on a wanted list, despite the fact that the whole murder is a set up. In fact, the culprit, our hero, does not even realise at the time that he is going to commit a murder, yet he is still guilty based upon such evidence.This is something that even now our society is struggling with since terrorists have become more brazen in their attempts to wreck havoc. We want to be protected from sin, but we are not willing to give up our freedom for that protection. In many cities today we cannot walk around without being on film, and in a way that is said to protect us from possible terrorists, but in another way it is a means of keeping track of people who might be considered a danger to society, and even then, who is the one who determines what is dangerous and what is not dangerous.In the film we have a future where everybody is identified through their eye scans, however these eye scans are also used as a means to advertise directly to us, yet because of this, nobody can hide. The computer knows exactly where you are at every time of the day. As is seen at the beginning of the film, the only way to free yourself from this is to actually remove your eyes, which is what the drug dealer does. However, at what cost does this come? Even then, despite the fact that we have our eyes, in many cases we are blind to the reality that is around us. We are blind to the fact that even our thoughts can convict us, and the mere setting up of a process that will ultimately lead to a murder, despite the murder never being committed, will result in you going to hell.

However, in the series, the entire episode with the forest dwellers is actually set in the second series where Flash, Dale, and Zarkov travel to Mars.While this is not a movie that stands out on its special effects or any deep meaning behind the story, it is still a cult classic, even if it is only because of the soundtrack ('Flash Gordon approaching!', 'What do you mean Flash Gordon approaching!').

It is at times hilarious, smart and dramatic while at other times it is juvenile, misguided and irrational. The fourth movie from Kevin Smith, Dogma, plays out nicely but leaves the viewer slightly empty after watching the film.The plot concerns two angels, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, who have been banned from heaven and have found a loop hole that will get them back in. At the same time, a woman, Linda Fiorentino, is charged by God to stop them. The movie races from one scene to the next, leaving no time to breathe. Joke after joke comes flying at the viewer, while at the same time philosophical banter on religion comes just as fast. Like Clerks. and Mallrats, this movie is made up of a whole mesh of scenes that form a cohesive whole. Unlike those movies though, there is a strong story that is told as the movie plays out.Coming after Chasing Amy, an absolutely fantastic low budget romantic comedy, Smith's Dogma just seems to pale in comparison. The movie tells a story but the scenes and dialogue come at you so fast that there is never time to digest what just happened. Just as you are thinking about the last scene, or about the comedic repertoire spouted out by one of the characters, or the commentary on Christianity (or religion in general) that is rather astute in it's logic, Smith throws another of those three motifs at you. You forget about what it was that made you think, or laugh and you move on to the next piece. About 90 percent of the film plays out this way. If Dogma was a straight out comedy, like Clerks., then this wouldn't be a problem, but considering the dramatic theme on religion that is inherent in the script, the movie just doesn't play out as well as it could. Even though the film feels a tad too long at it's just over two hour runtime, the film could of been a wee bit longer to flesh out the ideas that Smith is trying to convey.That aside, the only other complaint I have with Dogma is that at times it comes off as rather tepid. Bodily function jokes and cheap shots at sex and religion are in abundance, and again, in the right context this type of humor works a hell of a lot better. Chasing Amy showed a more mature side of Kevin Smith. It was far more sophisticated than Mallrats and even Clerks.. Dogma tries real hard to reach the same heights as, and even soar past, Chasing Amy and there are fleeting glimpses of it succeeding but ultimately the poop joke overshadows the rest of the film.One last thing before I move to the positives of Dogma. There are many a plot hole in this film. There is one glaring one that cannot be mentioned, in lieu of giving away a major plot point, but one that frustrated me to no end. The rest of them, I think could easily of been avoided if the movie was a few minutes longer.Okay, onto the good things about Dogma.The acting in this film is pretty damn good. All the leads are excellent and even though I usually don't like Chris Rock, he was pretty damn good too. Fiorentino exudes cool and sexy, Alan Rickman is strong as ever and Affleck and Damon are always fun to watch together. But this film belongs to Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith). Having made somewhat brief appearances in Smith's previous three films, they return as major characters this time around. The two together are uproarious and are a joy to watch.And Smith's direction of the action is better than anything he has done before. Chasing Amy delivered on a promise he showed in Clerks. and Dogma expands on that delivery. Shooting for the first time in the scope ratio of 2.35, Smith and his crew have made a beautiful looking film. With rich colours, beautiful framed shots and more camera movement than Clerks., Mallrats and Chasing Amy combined, Dogma stands out as the first Kevin Smith film that is more than just a screenplay. Smith has a much bigger budget to play with this time around and he uses it to great effect.And the sound. I can't not mention the sound. Smith's previous films have all sounded flat. They didn't need much in way of sound but still, they were rather flat and tinny with not much in production value. Not Dogma! Nu-uh! Armed with a great score by Howard Shore and a rich and lustful sound effects track, Dogma sounds awesome. It's clear, it's loud, it's enveloping; it's a thing of beauty.Kudos Mr. Smith on your fourth feature film. It's nice to see you blossoming into such a fine director, much better than what you gave the world in Mallrats. Dogma is a good film, it's witty and smart and is fun to watch right from the get go. It's just a shame that it comes off as so inconsequential. A movie that tackles the subjects that Dogma does should leave the viewer thinking long after the credits role. Sadly, after watching Dogma, all one is left with at the end of the day is a hazy memory of a poop joke.Film Rating 79%Breakdown (How Dogma scored 79%)Production Design 8 out of 10 Cinematography 8 out of 10 Re-playability 8 out of 10 Originality 9 out of 10 Costumes 8 out of 10 Directing 8 out of 10 Editing 7 out of 10 Acting 8 out of 10 Music 8 out of 10 Script 7 out of 10Read more of my reviews at www.fullmetalreviews.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"14 December 2012","score":"","review":" Dogma is a strange beast of a movie.

At the same time, a woman, Linda Fiorentino, is charged by God to stop them. The movie races from one scene to the next, leaving no time to breathe. Joke after joke comes flying at the viewer, while at the same time philosophical banter on religion comes just as fast. Like Clerks. and Mallrats, this movie is made up of a whole mesh of scenes that form a cohesive whole. Unlike those movies though, there is a strong story that is told as the movie plays out.Coming after Chasing Amy, an absolutely fantastic low budget romantic comedy, Smith's Dogma just seems to pale in comparison. The movie tells a story but the scenes and dialogue come at you so fast that there is never time to digest what just happened. Just as you are thinking about the last scene, or about the comedic repertoire spouted out by one of the characters, or the commentary on Christianity (or religion in general) that is rather astute in it's logic, Smith throws another of those three motifs at you. You forget about what it was that made you think, or laugh and you move on to the next piece. About 90 percent of the film plays out this way. If Dogma was a straight out comedy, like Clerks., then this wouldn't be a problem, but considering the dramatic theme on religion that is inherent in the script, the movie just doesn't play out as well as it could. Even though the film feels a tad too long at it's just over two hour runtime, the film could of been a wee bit longer to flesh out the ideas that Smith is trying to convey.That aside, the only other complaint I have with Dogma is that at times it comes off as rather tepid. Bodily function jokes and cheap shots at sex and religion are in abundance, and again, in the right context this type of humor works a hell of a lot better. Chasing Amy showed a more mature side of Kevin Smith. It was far more sophisticated than Mallrats and even Clerks.. Dogma tries real hard to reach the same heights as, and even soar past, Chasing Amy and there are fleeting glimpses of it succeeding but ultimately the poop joke overshadows the rest of the film.One last thing before I move to the positives of Dogma. There are many a plot hole in this film. There is one glaring one that cannot be mentioned, in lieu of giving away a major plot point, but one that frustrated me to no end. The rest of them, I think could easily of been avoided if the movie was a few minutes longer.Okay, onto the good things about Dogma.The acting in this film is pretty damn good. All the leads are excellent and even though I usually don't like Chris Rock, he was pretty damn good too. Fiorentino exudes cool and sexy, Alan Rickman is strong as ever and Affleck and Damon are always fun to watch together. But this film belongs to Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith). Having made somewhat brief appearances in Smith's previous three films, they return as major characters this time around. The two together are uproarious and are a joy to watch.And Smith's direction of the action is better than anything he has done before. Chasing Amy delivered on a promise he showed in Clerks. and Dogma expands on that delivery. Shooting for the first time in the scope ratio of 2.35, Smith and his crew have made a beautiful looking film. With rich colours, beautiful framed shots and more camera movement than Clerks., Mallrats and Chasing Amy combined, Dogma stands out as the first Kevin Smith film that is more than just a screenplay. Smith has a much bigger budget to play with this time around and he uses it to great effect.And the sound. I can't not mention the sound. Smith's previous films have all sounded flat. They didn't need much in way of sound but still, they were rather flat and tinny with not much in production value. Not Dogma! Nu-uh! Armed with a great score by Howard Shore and a rich and lustful sound effects track, Dogma sounds awesome. It's clear, it's loud, it's enveloping; it's a thing of beauty.Kudos Mr. Smith on your fourth feature film. It's nice to see you blossoming into such a fine director, much better than what you gave the world in Mallrats. Dogma is a good film, it's witty and smart and is fun to watch right from the get go. It's just a shame that it comes off as so inconsequential. A movie that tackles the subjects that Dogma does should leave the viewer thinking long after the credits role.

The movie begins in 1958; the show '21' is on the top of its ratings. Their current champ, Herbert Stempel (John Turturro) seems to have great memory and a broad range of knowledge on many topics. John Turturro has always been an underrated actor, and his role as Stempbel is one of his best roles. He's able to make the audience sweat it out and think that he is really playing the game straight. He's also a pudgy loudmouth with a grating aspergery weirdness personality. We, the audience will never know who he is. The show's producers created the image of a nebbishy, awkward square in order to first make home audiences sympathize with him, and then root against him. So John Turturro is able to make him look like a quiet nerd, while also a loudmouth. The producers got tired of him, and wanted somebody more cleared cut, handsome, and somebody the audience can appeal to. What the audience doesn't know is that the show is rigged and the winners are fed the answers. Herbert is encouraged to take a dive and allow Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), a handsome and charming college professor, to become the show's new champion. Ralph gives the character, the American aristocrat feel to him. Like Stempel, we don't know truly how Charles Van Doren acted. Ralph is able to show Charles Van Doren bad acting with furrowed brow agonizing, while also showing what could have been Van Doren real self. Congressional investigator Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow) can see through the lies and began to snoop to takes him to Stempel, who claims the show's producers ordered him to lose to Doren. Morrow is emotionally drawn to Van Doren, as he invites Morrow to many of his social circle of Ivy League WASPs. He still wants to bring the TV industry and its corporate sponsors to its knees, but Doren is in danger of getting expose. He's torn between his newfound friendship with Doran and his quest for the truth. Director Robert Redford and writer Paul Attanasio paint a telling portrait of how the network heads and advertising men who manipulated the quiz shows were also able to manipulate the responsibility for the scandal away from themselves. It has a 'All the President's Men' to it with Morrow as the intrepid investigator, is a detective story full of familiar Watergate patterns the late-night poring over lists of potential sources, the confrontations with tight-lipped witnesses at their front doors, the publicly inaccessible authority that needs toppling. However, the movie doesn't end with a clear answer. There is a sympathetic Hollywood spin on the real counterpart. In a film that takes exception to deception (or dramatic manipulation) in the name of entertainment, it's more than a little ironic that Quiz Show&#x97;as enjoyable as it is&#x97;pulls the same kind of wool over your eyes. The irony is that the producers were trying to create as much drama as possible for the audience. It mirrors the real life show. You never know what truly happen. Depending who you are, this might leave you with sour grapes in your mouth or a wonderful taste of perfect wine.

Its anime version was broadcast in 1965 in Japan and United States, being the first color animated television show created. In the other hand, The Lion King was released in 1994 with great success, becoming one of Disney's most important movie. Both stories are about a young lion that fights for the recovery of his lands and has to learn the responsibilities of being a king.When Disney released The Lion King, people from different countries found similarities between the two works, a lot of characters of The Lion King seemed to be almost copied from Kimba. For instance, Rafkin from The Lion King resembles to Kimba's mandrill Dan'l Baboon, also Scar in The Lion King is similar to Jamar from Kimba and both have the same dark color fur and a deformed eye. Likewise, the warthog Pumbaa looks like Kimba's Gargoyle T. Warthog. There are similar scenes as well the King on the Pride Rock -one of the most famous images in both stories-, the betrayal of Kimba's aunt and his falling into the cliff (in The Lion King the scenes takes place with Simba's uncle), the stampede, the thorn patch and the image of Kimba's father among clouds. The San Francisco Chronicle and The Los Angeles Times, published articles pointing out the resemblance between the Lion King and the Japanese series. These articles focuses on Disney's affirmation of not having any previous knowledge of the Japanese show. This attitude annoyed people and fans around the world, but especially in Japan where people felt Disney overlooked Tezuka's work by plagiarizing Kimba. But, besides all the obvious similarities, Disney insisted that it never heard about Kimba, and declared that The Lion King was inspired by Shakespeare's plays Hamlet and Macbeth. Evidently, and considering all similarities, Japanese authors were upset with Disney's notorious inspiration of their classics. Their main claim was that Disney did not make any mention nor did any recognition to Tezuka's famous work. Tezuka's family also recognized the similarities between the two works but they decided, along with Tezuka Productions, not to start a legal process. They claimed that one of the main reasons was that Disney's and Tezuka's good personal and commercial relationship. In fact, Tezuka was a huge fan of Disney's work and at one time he had hoped to have Disney do an adaptation of Kimba. Moreover, the definition of plagiarism includes the lack of own creativity by an artist, which is evident in The Lion King, and the failure of recognizing the material to its actual author; therefore, the most important issues addressed by the Tezuka's family and fans in general, is Disney's failure in recognizing Tezuka's work. It is clear that the Lion King has a different origin than the solely Disney's team imagination. For instance, in the book Perspectives on Plagiarism and Intellectual Property in a Postmodern World, the author quotes Lomer and Ashmun's The Study and Practice of Writing English, defining plagiarism as a matter of probity The use of another's ideas or words without due acknowledgment is known as plagiarism; it is commonly regarded as a literary theft &#x96;as inexcusable as any other kind of dishonesty' This means, Disney's fault in not recognizing or giving any credit to Tezuka's Kimba is perhaps the major problem of the whole situation with The Lion King. Moreover, if it is only considered the sequence of time and how events happened, it can be observed that the fact of taking ideas from one job already existing can be called plagiarism. Kimba was first and the Lion King second; and considering that Disney should recognize that its idea was seen before and it should cite Tezuka's work.There are lots of evidence indicating that Disney copied Kimba such as a striking screenshot from an early presentation of The Lion King with a white lion cub. Also, there are so many things in common between the two stories that it is hard to believe it was just coincidence. Thus, Disney's denial of any kind of plagiarism is merely sad.In the end, the Lion King and Kimba are both very important works. Therefore, their value would not be diminished by saying that Kimba is the inspiration of The Lion King and with just one word of recognition to its author it would have made very happy not only a whole country, but it also would have set a precedent for future plagiarists.

","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"14 December 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The recent release of The Lion King in 3D brought to my mind one of the most interesting cases of copying in the movie industry Kimba, the White Lion versus Disney's The Lion King.In one hand, Kimba, the White Lion was created in 1950 by Osamu Tezuka, one of the most important Japanese cartoonist. Its anime version was broadcast in 1965 in Japan and United States, being the first color animated television show created. In the other hand, The Lion King was released in 1994 with great success, becoming one of Disney's most important movie. Both stories are about a young lion that fights for the recovery of his lands and has to learn the responsibilities of being a king.When Disney released The Lion King, people from different countries found similarities between the two works, a lot of characters of The Lion King seemed to be almost copied from Kimba. For instance, Rafkin from The Lion King resembles to Kimba's mandrill Dan'l Baboon, also Scar in The Lion King is similar to Jamar from Kimba and both have the same dark color fur and a deformed eye. Likewise, the warthog Pumbaa looks like Kimba's Gargoyle T. Warthog. There are similar scenes as well the King on the Pride Rock -one of the most famous images in both stories-, the betrayal of Kimba's aunt and his falling into the cliff (in The Lion King the scenes takes place with Simba's uncle), the stampede, the thorn patch and the image of Kimba's father among clouds. The San Francisco Chronicle and The Los Angeles Times, published articles pointing out the resemblance between the Lion King and the Japanese series. These articles focuses on Disney's affirmation of not having any previous knowledge of the Japanese show. This attitude annoyed people and fans around the world, but especially in Japan where people felt Disney overlooked Tezuka's work by plagiarizing Kimba. But, besides all the obvious similarities, Disney insisted that it never heard about Kimba, and declared that The Lion King was inspired by Shakespeare's plays Hamlet and Macbeth. Evidently, and considering all similarities, Japanese authors were upset with Disney's notorious inspiration of their classics. Their main claim was that Disney did not make any mention nor did any recognition to Tezuka's famous work. Tezuka's family also recognized the similarities between the two works but they decided, along with Tezuka Productions, not to start a legal process. They claimed that one of the main reasons was that Disney's and Tezuka's good personal and commercial relationship. In fact, Tezuka was a huge fan of Disney's work and at one time he had hoped to have Disney do an adaptation of Kimba. Moreover, the definition of plagiarism includes the lack of own creativity by an artist, which is evident in The Lion King, and the failure of recognizing the material to its actual author; therefore, the most important issues addressed by the Tezuka's family and fans in general, is Disney's failure in recognizing Tezuka's work. It is clear that the Lion King has a different origin than the solely Disney's team imagination. For instance, in the book Perspectives on Plagiarism and Intellectual Property in a Postmodern World, the author quotes Lomer and Ashmun's The Study and Practice of Writing English, defining plagiarism as a matter of probity The use of another's ideas or words without due acknowledgment is known as plagiarism; it is commonly regarded as a literary theft &#x96;as inexcusable as any other kind of dishonesty' This means, Disney's fault in not recognizing or giving any credit to Tezuka's Kimba is perhaps the major problem of the whole situation with The Lion King. Moreover, if it is only considered the sequence of time and how events happened, it can be observed that the fact of taking ideas from one job already existing can be called plagiarism. Kimba was first and the Lion King second; and considering that Disney should recognize that its idea was seen before and it should cite Tezuka's work.There are lots of evidence indicating that Disney copied Kimba such as a striking screenshot from an early presentation of The Lion King with a white lion cub. Also, there are so many things in common between the two stories that it is hard to believe it was just coincidence.

Therefore, their value would not be diminished by saying that Kimba is the inspiration of The Lion King and with just one word of recognition to its author it would have made very happy not only a whole country, but it also would have set a precedent for future plagiarists.

My old VHS tape was worn through by the time I grew up and forgot about it. Now, years later, I decided to give it another spin and discover whether it was one of those films that holds up even when you're an adult...The answer is a resounding YES! GHOSTBUSTERS is still a great movie, a thoroughly entertaining classic for all ages. It's an out-and-out comedy featuring my favourite performance from a beautifully deadpan Bill Murray, who's perfectly supposed by Dan Ackroyd (who makes a great butt for the jokes), Harold Ramis (as the straight guy), Ernie Hudson (underrated), Sigourney Weaver (a delightful role reversal from Ellen Ripley) and little Rick Moranis, who's always hilarious.Although the film was made nearly 30 years ago, it hasn't dated in the slightest and the detectives vs. spooks storyline still holds up really well. I just can't get over how well made it is, with scenes that should be ridiculous (such as the climax) just totally gathering you up and immersing you in the experience. I love the Lovecraftian undertones, and the way the special effects are still much, much better than most of the CGI in modern movies. Those stop motion dog-creatures, absolutely fantastic, even now.Okay, so the sequel wasn't so great, but I'm a firm believer in the fact that no matter how many bad sequels or remakes, you can never spoil the entertainment value of a classic movie.

The next duel between Romeo and Tybalt is more serious and more violent. While in the first duel, there is only playful hooting and cheering heard in the background, in the second there is panic, yelling and tense clanking of swords, every sound keeping us in anticipation for that fateful moment that shall change Romeo's life. Both the duels are craftily filmed and brilliantly enacted not only by the duelers but also the spectators &#x96; young, hot-blooded, reckless men who are heedless of the possible consequences of their adventurous actions. In fact, it is this young blood that inflames the adrenaline rush, the sexual chemistry and the romantic poetry of 'Romeo and Juliet'; Franco Zeffirelli was absolutely right in his casting choices of not just the leads but also the supporting characters and extras.The renowned adaptation of Shakespeare's world-renowned play of the same name is about two unfortunate star-crossed lovers Romeo and Juliet; both are the only children of rival families Montagues and Capulets respectively, whose inveterate hatred towards each other stands in the way of their pure love. The two lovers are aided in their secret love affair by a friar and Juliet's nurse and everything goes steady until Romeo, as an act of vengeance, slays Tybalt, Juliet's cousin for murdering Romeo's best friend Mercurio. There ends the comedy and then ensues the tragedy but with a redeeming consequence for the feuding families. Romeo and Juliet is a very sexy play which may turn into trite love story in the wrong hands, and Franco does not allow this to happen &#x96; his cast is primarily young, beautiful, fresh and effervescent. The chemistry between them is lively and spontaneous and set the perfect mood for the film. Unable to control his impulses, Romeo reveals himself to Juliet by stumbling towards her below her balcony and you really feel that only a young, not-very-experienced actor would have done that so well. Even later, after Romeo tells the nurse about his plan, he begins to leave but stops suddenly on his tracks and gestures towards her to lead the way. The action again succeeds only when the actor playing Romeo is young; in the case of Mercurio, an older actor would've ruined Mercurio's vigorous charm by acting slightly obnoxious and too bawdy and lascivious to be likable. Youth keeps charm afresh, and all the scenes therefore seem perfectly executed with the young cast. Franco Zeffirelli also trims the play very well, reducing the emphasis on Rosaline and thus making Romeo seem less impulsive a character. While reading the play, I was slightly off-put when the tone abruptly switched after Capulet welcomes his guest, to Romeo asking the servant about Juliet; in the film, Franco does a great job at protracting the scene with Romeo searching first for Rosaline and then seeing Juliet at a distance, dancing gracefully along with Paris. The banquet sequence is excellently shot, cutting from long wide angle shots of the guests dancing (and it was such a different dance from the silly hands-in-the- air dance we do now) to medium shots of Juliet and Romeo encountering each other while dancing and also cutting away to shots of a furious Tybalt lambasting Capulet for allowing a Montague to set foot at their house. Franco cuts out Paris' death towards the end (was it really required?) of the story and trims some of Juliet's wonderful lines, but I was fine with that too (after Tybalt's death and the prince's announcement, the scene cuts\/dissolves to Juliet sobbing with the nurse in the film, unlike the play in which Juliet gives a long monologue awaiting the nurse's return, then thinks Romeo is dead, then thinks both Romeo and Tybalt are dead, and then finds out the true story&#x85; unnecessary).The melodic score by Nino Rota is memorable, especially the tune that plays at three or four points whenever Romeo and Juliet are together, but towards the end when you hear it you feel sad because it was the same score played with different tempo during the balcony scene. Whiting, playing Romeo is a shade more convincing than Hussey, playing Juliet but both have superb intimate chemistry, and the best part is that neither of the actors are experienced. John Mcenery plays Mercurio with vital energy, and humor and inescapable charm, though I wish I could find out why he was the way he was &#x96; some say he had homosexual tendencies towards Romeo but not with absolute certainty while others just consider him slightly wayward in character. The highlight is the hilarious encounter between Mcenery and the nurse, and this was Mcenery had to be careful not to look to offensive in his handling\/fondling and he does it charmingly, kissing her on the cheeks after troubling the poor lady. Speaking of nurse, Pat Heywood was rollickingly sweet and funny, and Michael York has the appearance of a wolf that well suits his character. Although we do not hear Italian accent, we get a flavor of it, as in when Romeo air kisses in a very Italian way at the church after meeting the nurse; the boisterous energy is also associative to Italians. The extras also do a great job o setting the right mood, for example, when the singer croons at the banquet and Juliet and Romeo move towards each other, the expressions on the faces of the guests busy listening to the sweet music is notable an old man tilts his head towards one side and holds one hand near his ear as if straining slightly due to age and remembering fond old memories. Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet is a classic; like James Cameron's Titanic, it's young blood keeps its passion fresh and flaming.

Franco cuts out Paris' death towards the end (was it really required?) of the story and trims some of Juliet's wonderful lines, but I was fine with that too (after Tybalt's death and the prince's announcement, the scene cuts\/dissolves to Juliet sobbing with the nurse in the film, unlike the play in which Juliet gives a long monologue awaiting the nurse's return, then thinks Romeo is dead, then thinks both Romeo and Tybalt are dead, and then finds out the true story&#x85; unnecessary).The melodic score by Nino Rota is memorable, especially the tune that plays at three or four points whenever Romeo and Juliet are together, but towards the end when you hear it you feel sad because it was the same score played with different tempo during the balcony scene. Whiting, playing Romeo is a shade more convincing than Hussey, playing Juliet but both have superb intimate chemistry, and the best part is that neither of the actors are experienced. John Mcenery plays Mercurio with vital energy, and humor and inescapable charm, though I wish I could find out why he was the way he was &#x96; some say he had homosexual tendencies towards Romeo but not with absolute certainty while others just consider him slightly wayward in character. The highlight is the hilarious encounter between Mcenery and the nurse, and this was Mcenery had to be careful not to look to offensive in his handling\/fondling and he does it charmingly, kissing her on the cheeks after troubling the poor lady. Speaking of nurse, Pat Heywood was rollickingly sweet and funny, and Michael York has the appearance of a wolf that well suits his character. Although we do not hear Italian accent, we get a flavor of it, as in when Romeo air kisses in a very Italian way at the church after meeting the nurse; the boisterous energy is also associative to Italians. The extras also do a great job o setting the right mood, for example, when the singer croons at the banquet and Juliet and Romeo move towards each other, the expressions on the faces of the guests busy listening to the sweet music is notable an old man tilts his head towards one side and holds one hand near his ear as if straining slightly due to age and remembering fond old memories. Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet is a classic; like James Cameron's Titanic, it's young blood keeps its passion fresh and flaming.
