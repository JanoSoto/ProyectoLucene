Nothing at all, it seems. Even movies from the same American movement like the Graduate and Taxi Driver took their cues from old and new sources, mixing new themes and a raw frankness with some elegant film-making that is interesting on its own terms.Not here. And this is partly what makes the movie important, if not great, whatever greatness is. The drifting story line, the grimy mise-en-scene, the forlorn realization that this really is America for a lot of people, all of this makes the movie unique and moving and stark in a way that movies rarely were, or rarely are. It's not just Nicholson's coming out party (out to the wider public). It's a weirdly wonderful movie.Earlier serious films about misfits and the disaffected among us (not prison films and more obvious outsider scenes) include The Misfits of course but also Days of Wine and Roses and Lost Weekend. But these have such a different patina to them, and ultimately such different intentions, it's hard to remember just how far gone the days of studio movie-making and all the careful slickness of them are gone. Cukor, Wilder, and above all Wyler are hardly possible, at least not with the same pertinence. All of this defends it in history, but what about as a movie in it's own right? I think it wavers. Yes, the beginning is fast and powerful, shifting ground and getting us as footloose as the protagonist. And the end is so quietly nasty and yet, weirdly, liberating and appropriate, it's great, too. Between is a lot of great stuff, some of it legendary. But in a film that demands (and creates) a full fledged realism, there are parts that just don't hold water. The famous diner scene is funny, but it's more about being a show off than really responding to the situation (no one is quite right in their theatrical reactions). And other moments like this (the scene where Nicholson visits the old-school family most of all) make you realize the film is only ninety percent there.Which is enough, really. What works works great, really edgy and fresh and quiet and creepy. And believable. Nice stuff.

Even though this was apparently both a critical and box office success, and has spawned two sequels since then, it took me years to finally get around to seeing it. I'm not exactly sure why, since I've been aware of its existence for a few years now and saw Robots nearly four years ago and Horton Hears a Who last year. However, despite how long it took me to finally watch it after all these years, I now have seen it. Aware of its popularity beforehand, the movie did not fail to meet my reasonably high expectations.The story takes place many thousands of years ago. An ice age is coming, and animals are migrating south to escape the increasingly cold weather. A goofy, motormouth sloth named Sid wakes up to find that his family has migrated without him, and he is alone. As he tries to migrate on his own, he meets two rhinos and accidentally angers them. They want to kill him, but as he runs from them, they are fought off by a woolly mammoth named Manfred, whom Sid calls Manny. Sid begins to follow Manny, even though the mammoth finds him annoying and wants him to go away. Nearby, saber-toothed tigers invade the camp of a human tribe in an attempt to eat an infant as an act of revenge! The mother of this infant runs away with him and jumps into a river, leading her to Sid and Manny. Manny saves the baby just before his mother drowns, and the mammoth and sloth must attempt to get him back to his father. Diego, one of the tigers who attacked the camp, helps the two, but what they don't know is that he is leading them to a trap! The animation here is amazing, which is often the case in these CGI films. They developed some beautiful imagery of frozen land. I didn't like the way the humans were animated as much as the way the animals were, but animation-wise, I definitely can't complain about anything else. There's a lot of humour in the film, often thanks to the goofy antics of Sid, voiced by John Leguizamo (though other characters can also be very funny as well), and the comical situations and conflict the main characters get into on their adventure. The subplot with a squirrel named Scrat trying to bury his acorn in various places is also pretty funny, if you like physical humour. Around the beginning, it may look like the film relies mainly on the animation and laughs for entertainment value, but as it goes on, it proves this isn't quite the case. There are some good action sequences, and eventually some touching moments and good morals, which it wouldn't be the same without. Of the three main cast members, Leguizamo was the only one I wasn't familiar with, and he does a nice job with his voice-over. There's also good voice acting from comedians Ray Romano (Manny) and Denis Leary (Diego).Since they started making full-length computer animated movies in the 90's, I've seen many that have come out over the years, and have found that some are masterpieces while others are basically average (haven't seen any terrible ones, though it takes a lot to make a movie terrible to me). Like a number of others I've seen, this one comes somewhere in between, but fortunately comes closer to the former. I guess I can see why this 2002 release doesn't have appeal as wide as several Pixar efforts do, but can also see why it is quite popular nonetheless. Ice Age was a good way for Blue Sky Studios to make their feature-length debut, and they have since gone on to do more good stuff. This movie has a simple but effective plot, plus a lot more to entertain viewers of different ages, making it another example of good family entertainment.

Her filmography consists of about 13 films, and then she died in 1965 of breast cancer. Indeed, had she been fortunate enough to live further she probably would have had a more illustrious career than she already had. 1950 was her best year as she got the starring role in Born Yesterday, mostly thanks to Katharine Hepburn, who she worked with on Adam's Rib and impressed so much that Hepburn pushed for her name to get publicity and fame.Based on a play by one of the screenwriters of Adam's Rib, Born Yesterday is a rather refreshing look at the game of politics as well as American society and its views of education. Holliday is wonderful as Billie Dawn, an uneducated and mostly subdued woman taken under the wing of a powerful, loud, boisterous steel tycoon (Broderick Crawford) who basically controls her every move. Wanting to impress the people he hopes to work with, this Mr. Brock hires a smart but controversial reporter played very straight and forward by William Holden, one of the most underrated stars of the early 20th century.In a movie like this with actors like Holliday and Holden, love is never far away. Yet, one of the things I loved about this film is that love is not the focal point of this relationship or the plot. Their attraction is immediate, but they put it aside for something more important; the education of this woman who has been under the foot of a man and never seemed to understand about the world outside of her own. As the two take tours of Washington DC and read books and newspapers, information and knowledge abound, especially about what the well-off Mr. Brock is doing in the nation's capital.This is Holliday's most celebrated role (she won the Oscar that year over Gloria Swanson and Bette Davis) and she certainly was the best choice for it. Her platinum blonde looks and New York accent strike well against the new-found knowledge she receives in this movie. Holden is good here as an idealistic and ambitious writer who never goes too far, always staying true to himself and being a solid character for the audience to follow. Crawford is also quite good as the tycoon believing everything can be taken by force except for intellectual. There is a lot of talk about the importance of knowing about our nation's government and the things that go on in it. Watching it, I never felt it was more prevalent than today. This is certainly a warm and funny comedy. But it also has a brain and something to say. Certainly that is a rarity.

Her filmography consists of about 13 films, and then she died in 1965 of breast cancer. Indeed, had she been fortunate enough to live further she probably would have had a more illustrious career than she already had. 1950 was her best year as she got the starring role in Born Yesterday, mostly thanks to Katharine Hepburn, who she worked with on Adam's Rib and impressed so much that Hepburn pushed for her name to get publicity and fame.Based on a play by one of the screenwriters of Adam's Rib, Born Yesterday is a rather refreshing look at the game of politics as well as American society and its views of education. Holliday is wonderful as Billie Dawn, an uneducated and mostly subdued woman taken under the wing of a powerful, loud, boisterous steel tycoon (Broderick Crawford) who basically controls her every move. Wanting to impress the people he hopes to work with, this Mr. Brock hires a smart but controversial reporter played very straight and forward by William Holden, one of the most underrated stars of the early 20th century.In a movie like this with actors like Holliday and Holden, love is never far away. Yet, one of the things I loved about this film is that love is not the focal point of this relationship or the plot. Their attraction is immediate, but they put it aside for something more important; the education of this woman who has been under the foot of a man and never seemed to understand about the world outside of her own. As the two take tours of Washington DC and read books and newspapers, information and knowledge abound, especially about what the well-off Mr. Brock is doing in the nation's capital.This is Holliday's most celebrated role (she won the Oscar that year over Gloria Swanson and Bette Davis) and she certainly was the best choice for it. Her platinum blonde looks and New York accent strike well against the new-found knowledge she receives in this movie. Holden is good here as an idealistic and ambitious writer who never goes too far, always staying true to himself and being a solid character for the audience to follow. Crawford is also quite good as the tycoon believing everything can be taken by force except for intellectual.

It's hard to believe that anyone would make a movie that was so supportive of women and mothers in 1945. The way the woman protagonist is portrayed and viewed in the story would make me believe this was a modern movie. It features Joan Crawford as woman who tries her best as a mother to survive while being independent. Meanwhile she sees her daughter slowly become a tragedy as her spoiled nature consumes her. The character development of every character is very clear and helps the story drag out without being too boring.Joan Crawford gives a really good performance that brings a lot of charisma. The whole cast is very interesting and you can see a natural reaction in almost every second of the movie.The movie ties up details very smoothly considering how confusing the first few scenes can be. The film noir contrast of brightness in different scenes sets the mood very nicely and use innovative camera techniques to intrigue the viewer. The camera makes very good use of it's framing by often setting itself just over and behind the back of the shoulder to give an almost first perspective while making sure that the viewer knows who they are supposed to feel like. It also at the same time brings more attention to the person who we are supposed to be focused on. This camera technique is used in a few movies like Romero's Night of the Living Dead, but it's switched with other camera shots to break monotony and make good use of other cinematic techniques.The lighting is perfect. The use of background lights is very good, but the movie also uses shadows with that lighting to create subtle symbolism during scenes of resolution and conflict. The sound is also really good and doesn't sound cliché except for maybe in a few scenes where it still works. The sound effects are also effective.

This gave rise to the iconic Pinhead and made Clive Barker very much a household name (if he wasn't by then). Based on The Hellbound Heart the story had great potential, albeit putting any Clive Barker movie on the big screen is of high risk, as the poetry and literary flare of this writer is way ahead of any else in the genre.Clive Barker is to horror what Iain M. Banks is to sci-fi... an unhinged reservoir of invention, make-believe and limitless imagination with an astounding use of the language to boot. It always seem slightly awkward that such a talented writer delved in the horror genre, but he did...Personally I hold Hellraiser as Clive Barker's second biggest on-screen success closely following Candyman, but the movie 20 years onwards still packs an immense punch and should be required watching.Frank Cotton (Sean Chapman) is in constant search of thrills and adventure. During one escapade he purchases a small cube from a dealer somewhere in the Moslem world. Unswayed by the consequences he opens the cube thus opening the gateway to pain inhabited by the Cenobites - by some held as devils, by other as angels...Some time later his brother Larry (Andrew Robinson) and his new wife Julia (Claire Higgins) move into the derelict house, where Frank was last alive. Larry's daughter Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) decides against living with her father and stepmother renting a room in town with her boyfriend. A chance accident at the house awakes the past and frees what remains of Frank from his prison...The greatest success of this movie is being gruesome while being tasteful at the same time. The gore is present and will make you cringe and despite the retro feel to the movie it is light years ahead of most modern horror films. Holds well despite the time passing by, albeit some special effects are in need of an emergency update (hence maybe the remake planned for 2011?). That said all the monsters themselves look just as good and impressive as ever and Pinhead really will make you want to run.The acting is nothing of note, but at the same time does not detract from the guilty watching pleasure. The movies main flaw (as with most screen adaptation of Barker's) is its lacking script, which goes awry somewhere in the last 30 minutes. The motivation of the Cenobites takes a hit by the lack of build-up and Barker really should have focused more effort on presenting the 'otherworlders' and what makes them tick. Some of the lines sold by Pinhead and his posse is just weak scriptwriting. More sinister and complex actions of the evil they represented would really benefit the movie. This movie really is more like a 'introduction' to the Cenobites, hence can't really be surprised several sequels were panned out in the subsequent years.

He's pretty ravaged by drugs and alcohol by this point in his career, and it's sad that he had to wind down his life with stuff like this. Tor Johnson puts in his usual stellar performance.Lugosi, after moving all around the world to hide his experiments that were initially scoffed at, now presides in an alligator infested swamp in a crusty old mansion. Stock footage of lightning constantly flashes overhead. In the nearby lake, a killer giant octopus lurks(again, brought to life with stock footage).

They investigate the mysterious goings-on at Château de Monster only to be captured. Some terrible fight scenes ensue, and a jealous Lobo(Tor) plays the quick change on Lugosi and subjects him to his own experiments because Lobo thinks Janet's traffic cones are out of this world.Here is where the film really fails, if it hasn't already.

He breaks his straps and kicks Lobo's butt, but when he escapes the burning mansion, doggedly hunted, and shot, by several officers, he doesn't do anything with his newfound abilities but run around and occasionally put on a Karloff sneer.

I hated the agony rolls of the octopus's victims. If the darn thing won't move, at least have some offscreen hands drag the victims underwater. That's sort of scary.Oh well.

I was actually looking forward to seeing Lugosi as a superman. He breaks his straps and kicks Lobo's butt, but when he escapes the burning mansion, doggedly hunted, and shot, by several officers, he doesn't do anything with his newfound abilities but run around and occasionally put on a Karloff sneer. Something that would have been really cool, truly a wasted opportunity, was when Lugosi runs past a giant boulder that Dick eventually pushed down a hill over him and Lugosi does nothing! He was superstrong, he could have picked up that paper boulder and really trounced someone with it. I'd seen the film Ed Wood long ago, so I knew some of what to expect in certain scenes, especially the ending(Give me some of that whiskey!), and while Ed himself is much more competent than a lot of people say(if you think he is the worst, you obviously haven't seen very many films), I think much more could have been done with the budget. I hated the agony rolls of the octopus's victims. If the darn thing won't move, at least have some offscreen hands drag the victims underwater. That's sort of scary.Oh well. This is more of a sci-fi film than horror, which is why I think Monster was a poor choice for the title. You may enjoy its camp value, if you are into that sort of thing, but if you are looking for even halfway decent 50's atomic madness films, skip this one.Pull the string, pull the string!
