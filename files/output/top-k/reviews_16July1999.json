This film aims for much more than cheap thrills.  The Blair Witch Project will stay with you for a long while after you exit the theater, which makes the movie one of the most original horror films in recent times. To be honest, the movie is not all that scary until, I believe, the last 20 minutes of the picture.  I guarantee you I will never forget the horrific, yet unspectacular final images of this movie.  I praise filmmakers like this.  David Fincher did just that when he made both Seven and The Game.  A real scare never really leaves you, especially when you never get to see that which torments you.  At the very least, this film should be commended for its ability to tell a coherent story using the most basic of film and video equipment. The acting, almost completely improvised, is stellar; the three characters are at all times believable and sympathetic.  The first hour or so of the film establishes Heather, Josh, and Mike very well via funny situations and moments to which the average person can relate, which sets you up for the inevitable nightmare that is the last reel of the movie. The story is so absorbing because it's, literally, a scary story you tell around the campfire.  It's a brand new urban legend(sorry to reference such a terrible film) that will probably endure for quite a while.  The use of handheld 8mm video and gritty 16mm film gives you a direct and literal perspective of the person holding the camera.  You see what they see just as they see it.  You are at the whim of the cameraman(or woman), unable to control what you are about to discover. I highly recommend the Blair Witch Project for anyone who, for a change, wants to be taken somewhere they haven't been in a long time  the darkest pits of their imagination.

Some of those comments really suck they are pointless, untruthful, exaggerated, unsensible, underrated, flat, subjective ... etc, just plain stupid. I don't know what you guys expected from the movie, it is just another Star Wars movie, and that's it.I couldn't  believe when a read a comment from a guy saying that he couldn't stand the whole picture and left the theater before finished; man, I wanted to throw up!!, And HE calls himself a Star Wars Fan.Some other miss a Han Solo kind of character, but what the hell, this is not a new version of Episode 4 A New Hope, and for all of you guys, I think that Qui-Gon is a bit like Han Solo A guy who's always challenging the system, he's a rogue Jedi, he only follows his instinct, not a damn Jedi Counsel.Ok, I admit it, the movie is not perfect, at the beginning the editing is too anxious to reach Tatooine and find Anakin, traduction is goes too fast. Jar Jar Binks is cute and sometimes funny, and I understood mostly everything he said, but is true that they focused the camera too much on him, especially at the beginning. I read he will be back in the next movie, but less annoying and more important to the plot.Despite what people say, I liked that Darth Maul dies, he looks cool, and fights cool, but didn't have much of a personality, he'd only do as the emperor says,  I wouldn't like him as a fulltime bad guy, as Darth Vader was, the fact that he dies leaves much ground to plant on account of bad guys. After all, the next two movie will be full with great Jedi Battles, with all the Clone Wars and all. Perhaps Darth Maul will be back as a clone.The acting is quite good, Not BAD as people say, but after all, Star Wars hard point wasn't precisely in the acting. Liam Neeson is not bored as some guys say, it's just that Qui-Gon is too calm... too focus... too good a Jedi Master, more of a teacher than a fighter, he nevers gets nervous, or sad, or worried, except at the end, when he dies, he's only worried about Anakin's future.  Ewan McGregor is acceptable, his character doesn't do much at the beginning but at the end he becomes really important. Jake Lloyd did a great job, after all, he acted as a child, exactly as George Lucas wanted it, his lines are pretty flat sometimes, but after all, kids are never very elocuent when they talk, you always see those movies where kids are so clever, they outsmart the adults, that's not true, George Lucas stopped making movies 15 years ago so he can spend time with his children, so I believe he knows how a kid behaves. I also hate when people say that kids can't act, even acting as yourself is difficult, believe it or not, try it.I'm IN LOVE with Natalie Portman, she did a great job 'cause she encarnated two characters the beautiful, charming, and intelligent Padma; and the Queen, a very serious and focused girl, her performance is the best in the whole movie, as well as Pernilla August's, too bad she has few scenes, I know she will be back in Episode 2, when Anakin returns to free the slaves. Ian Mcdiarmid was also great, he steals every scene.Two great things about the story Chancellor Palpatine dark scheme, it was not til' the end that I realized HE is THE Emperor and that he used the Queen to get that post, Hey!! I knew that Palpatine is Darth Sidious, but his performance is so good that it still confused me. And R2D2 introduction, I had goosebumps when a saw him saving all the main characters (again) at the begininng of the film when all the R2 units go outside the ship to repair the shields and he alone remains safe and sound, there we get to see (or remind) how important that little droid is for the Star Wars movies.The movie is full of details, you have to see it at least three times to fully catch all the creatures and little details in every frame. Lucas outdone himself. Every creatures design looks great, the effects are so thoroughly well put together I didn't find any glitches. I think Lucas focused so much on the worlds because he couldn't in the other three because of the technology, here he show us that there is no limit to his imagination.I'm also a  Huge Fan of John Williams, I own almost all of his known soundtracks, and right know my precioussss (in gollum's words)  is The Phantom Menace, the song The Duel Of Fates (The Lightsaber Battle) is a masterpiece, I've hummed it almost every day; The Anakin's Theme is simply marvelous, the last four notes are from the Darth Vader Theme, that is really a genius job. All the other music establish a great atmosphere to the movie, many fanfares and marchs, as well as some very nice reprises of the Force Theme. Too bad the CD lacks a big amount of music of the movie the battle in the desert, the goodbye scene of Anakin with his mother (which is extremely beautiful), the jedi counsel, etc. I applaud his work, again... and again... and again.People can't expect this one to be the best, it can't, and is NOT. This is just a come-back from Lucas, a movie with thousands of  F\/X, many new characters and creatures, plots and subplots. And the plot holes are there on purpose, so they can be filled in the next two.After all, as a story it IS a prequel; but technically it IS a sequel. The movie prepare us for the next two, which I think will have less F\/X and more story. I can't believe We have to wait for three more years, it's a sin... it's a sin (in Alex's Words).Mark My words IMDB, this movie will be nominated for all these Oscars Best Sound, Best Sound Effects, Best Costume Design, Best Art Direction, Best Music,   Best Special Effects.I don't know which one will win, I'm sure about Costume Design and Art Direction.

I went to the earliest showing on the first day it was released (in San Jose) because I had been waiting in anticipation for quite some time.  I wanted to love this movie. Maybe that's my problem; my hopes were too high.The story revolves around Cruise's character, Bill Hartford, and the sexual quest he goes on after an argument with his wife. During the argument, which is over a difference in opinion about the true sexual desires of men vs. women, Bill's wife Alice (Kidman) tells him about her attempt to have a one-night stand with a naval officer a year ago.  If the officer had obliged, she would have risked everything to have sex with him.This revelation really sets Bill off.  The possibility that he was completely wrong about his wife and her unquestioning fidelity drives him mad.  Perhaps to avoid a reality quite opposite to the one he was living in (where men are controlled by their desire to have casual sex with many different women and women just want to be married and have sex with their husband) he sets out for an evening of cheap sex.  Ironically, his attempts at having affairs don't pan outThe controversial orgy scene is entertaining and a little creepy, but I wonder what the unedited portion would have been like.  Maybe that version will make it to the U.S. on video next year.  In any case, I won't be surprised if this flick gets great reviews, especially from men, for one or more of the following reasons1) Directed by Stanley Kubrick, and his last film, no less.   2) Nicole Kidman has some nude scenes.   3) There is an orgy scene.   3)a. There are many naked women on display in the orgy scene.All in all I thought it was good, but not great.

Maybe that's my problem; my hopes were too high.The story revolves around Cruise's character, Bill Hartford, and the sexual quest he goes on after an argument with his wife. During the argument, which is over a difference in opinion about the true sexual desires of men vs. women, Bill's wife Alice (Kidman) tells him about her attempt to have a one-night stand with a naval officer a year ago.

Walking out of the theatre, there were many people commenting on how bad it was. For a person looking for a porn film, I guess Eyes Wide Shut had too much plot and too little sex. For a person looking for an erotic thriller, I guess Eyes Wide Shut had too many open-ended questions and too few climatic scenes filled with answers. But for a person looking for a peek into the mind, into that Freudian unconscious, Eyes Wide Shut had plenty of images to contemplate.First of all, like all of Kubrick's films, Eyes Wide Shut is about images, visuals. Durring Cruise's night on the town Kubrick's grainy film mixed with his extensive backlighting creates a dream-like state. The camera is slow and methodic. It shows us all we need to see in this urban dreamscape (minus those pesky digital images!). Because thats what Eyes Wide Shut is a tour of the human dreamscape, or at least the seedier side of it.The plot moves slowly not concerned that it has left some questions unanswered, because this isn't a film about answers. Here we see another Kubrick signature, the open-ended ending. When those credits role, you'll probably still have questions or maybe you'll want to know what just hit you. Where did Kubrick just take you? What did you just see? I must say that one viewing, which is all that I have had, is insufficient to answer those questions completely.Eyes Wide Shut is an excellent movie that makes you think.

Kubrick died just five days after showing his film, suggested by Arthur Schnitzler's novel Traumnovelle, to Warner Bros. Thankfully, the studio has left most of Kubrick's vision intact, reportedly interfering with but a single scene. Eyes Wide Shut is sexy, emotional, thrilling, and sickening - and brilliant. During the filming, which took over a year, the cast and crew were sworn to secrecy. Speculation and rumors ran wild about the husband-and-wife team of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman would there be a steamy sex scene? Or, even more intriguing would we see Tom naked? All anyone really knew was that this was a sexy thriller, a la Basic Instinct. An early rumor I heard was that Kubrick decided to shoot a porno movie using well-known actors and a good script. Well, forget anything you may have heard before - you're in for a shock.Put simply, Eyes Wide Shut is not really about sex. Not that it isn't erotic - nearly every scene is alive with sexual energy - but there's a bigger game at stake than just the one played horizontally. This is a film about power, and the loss of power that comes with sexual situations. Tom Cruise, who plays Dr. Bill Harford, is disturbed when his wife Alice (played beautifully by Nicole Kidman) confesses having sexual thoughts about another man. Perhaps part revenge, part curiosity, he sets out on an odyssey to be unfaithful - but somehow, never succeeds. One is reminded of those characters in Greek mythology who were given the impossible tasks in Hades; one had to fill up a bucket with no bottom, and one had to constantly push a rock uphill that would always roll back down to the bottom. Dr. Harford is a man without power who nevertheless requires it - in most situations, his credentials give him power, but he discovers there are certain people he cannot impress simply by flashing his board card.One of these people is his wife - time and again, she takes the upper hand in their relationship. As Bill stumbles haplessly about New York, visions of Alice's infidelity flash through his mind. Much of his odyssey seems to stem from a This'll show her! mindset rather than the cool, rational façade he wants us to see. In fact, nearly all of Bill's actions seem impulsive - from his decision to visit a whore's bedroom to his chance meeting with an old friend at a piano bar to the drive to the infamous manor house where the film's climax occurs. Dr. Harford is unable to exude power here, in the company of an exclusive group of lechers and courtesans. He is seen instantly as an imposter, and the message is clear Only the powerful need remain.The specifics of the plot are not nearly as important as the film's ultimate message. Suffice to say, there is intrigue, murder, sex, drugs, and suspicion enough to keep even the most jaded moviegoer interested and guessing until the final scene. And, in keeping with the rest of the film, Cruise's character is not allowed to emerge victorious in the final reel - it is Alice who ultimately shows her strength and power, not Bill. Eyes Wide Shut, as its title may imply, is full of ironies both large and small the main character is an anti-hero, his every success doomed from the opening credits; a hooker has sociology textbooks on view in her apartment; a junkie and whore sacrifices herself to save another. What makes this movie so intriguing is that every scene, every moment captured on film, is so carefully constructed that we get the feeling we are standing just behind Bill, observing his tragic fall and even being drawn down with him.Eyes Wide Shut is an outstanding film, one that will be surely recognized by the Academy Awards. I would be very surprised indeed if Kubrick were not nominated posthumously for Best Director. In addition, it is rare indeed for a major studio release starring big-name stars to be an art film - and Eyes Wide Shut is a work of art. Every light, every mask, every character - all come together in a stunning array of beauty, shock, and wisdom that makes me realize what a tragic loss Mr. Kubrick's death was.

I think I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't been following it for several months and been so pumped up about it.  The performances are fabulous, especially those of Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise--the scenes in which they converse are especially well-acted and they have a very realistic feel to them--the couple should work together more often.  The cinematography is beautiful--their apartment on Central Park West and the seedy shops Dr. Harford (Tom Cruise) visits are equally visually stunning.  It all has a very grainy, blotchy look to it, which adds to the mystique.  And the story line is quite fascinating--for at least an hour after I left the theater, I was mulling over the plot points and the dialogue in the movie, simply because it is a great subject.I had only a few problems with the film.  One, it is TOO long.  170 minutes is entirely too long for this kind of subject matter.  Two, the characters have a tendency to repeat what was just said to them.  Cruise's character was most guilty of this--he'd be asked a question, and he'd repeat it before he'd answer it.  Nicole Kidman and Sydney Pollack did it a couple of times, too.  I don't know if it was written that way or if it was improvised, but it got on my nerves.  Three, the piano music in the climactic orgy scene and the scenes following is just plain annoying.  And four, the famous digital characters added in the orgy scene are *very* fake-looking.  Yes, they do properly cover the action they're supposed to cover, but they weren't necessary--from what I could see, the sexual activity wasn't as bad as the MPAA made it out to be.  One of the digital characters, a nude blonde woman, was obviously not real--they made the mistake of having her move her head at one point, and it just looks quite unhuman.  They should've stuck with the cloaked figures when they added the digital characters.I recommend this film for people who have an appreciation for Kubrick films, and for people who are not easily bored.  If you appreciate a movie for fine visuals and great performances, this is the one for you.

He fails miserably at it.Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman give incredibly self-conscious performances. Stanley probably wanted the tension and fear in the movie to build up naturally and hence might have decided to work with barely any background music. Added to this is the nauseatingly SLOW dialogue. The slow pace might help build tension in a lot of the cases, but in this movie it makes things WORSE..the reason very very self-conscious performances. it is very obvious that one the Hollywood's hottest couples when shown together in a supposedly-big-movie, turn into utterly self conscious and highly uncool couple.Well so much about the presentation...The content of the film has very explicit graphic sexuality. Even these parts aren't captivating.....The worst part of all, I was dying from the start through the end waiting for a joke that could even make me smile!!!! Some one in the movie hall more desperate than me went into an audible laughter exactly 2 times in the entire film.

I think that may have been what saved this movie for me. There are very few movies released at this time of year that live up to the hype. Star Wars Episode I is no exception to that rule but it does have a lot of redeeming features. Anyone with half a brain knew this film would have a weaker storyline than Episodes IV, V and VI otherwise this one would have been made in 1977, not Episode IV. The reason is that the main characters are Jedi, not the most interesting people in the universe, until they start fighting that is. So with no Han Solo character, this really is just a scene setter and should not really be looked at as anything else. Having said that the Special Effects are simply mind blowing. I don't think most people realise just how much of this movie is actually composited and it's certainly the best example of how it can be done well. It's a shoo-in for the Effects Oscar, only the Matrix provides any competition to it and in any other year the Matrix would have won it. But while Jar Jar is annoying at first, I stopped noticing it after a while. The performances are pretty good even though the roles were not too demanding. I am surprised that more was not made of Hugh Quarshie's role as Captain Panaka or Steven Speirs as Captain Tarpals these two seemed the only ones with good potential as characters. I'll admit to some confusion over the dual role of Amidala and Padme, which was which when? A far from perfect film that is let down in the first half but redeemed in the second half. From the Pod Race onwards it's excellent for all ages. Before that it's a little dull, the timing is off.

Darth Maul was just a meat-head Kiss fan, who stared alot.Yes, the pod race was exciting, and the best bit of the whole film was the Sand people shooting at them and jumping up and down. However, it all looked rather as if it had been designed in order to convert to a games console package with very little adjustment.All in all a truly unworthy prequel.

Very little is left for debate; most everything is spelled out, pressed hard, and dwelled upon.  His critics have compared the long waits between his films to the long periods of waiting that occur while watching his films.Personally, I like the long, slow scenes in his films.  When they're filled with something  music, movement, thought, memory of a previous scene, dread, or any other emotion, they can never really be said to be empty.  I like them because, with Kubrick, I can be sure that they're absolutely essential to his ultimate vision.  He could have put out a six-hour documentary on tissue manufacturing; at least I'll know that not one minute of screen time is wasted.Eyes Wide Shut isn't as vacuous as, say, Barry Lyndon or The Shining. Compared to those two, this one scoots along like a person trying to get to his car in the rain.  It'll try a lot of folks' patience, I'm sure -- even his most loyal fans will be bothered by the incessant piano bell tolls in the soundtrack of some scenes, or the constant reminders (in imaginary flashbacks) that Cruise's character is bothered by his wife's near-infidelity.  I know I was.Despite that, it's an apt final film for the long, glorious career of a man who has done more for the cinema, with less movies, than can ever be catalogued.  To try and cite influences for this particular work is futile. Though one might draw parallels to Lindsay Anderson's O Lucky Man! or Martin Scorsese's After Hours, Eyes Wide Shut is no less than a complete work from the cold heart and brilliant mind of Stanley Kubrick alone. It's also a furiously ingenious piece of filmmaking, one that works less on the emotions than on the senses and on the mind.  Unlike most of Kubrick's earlier work, however, it does have an emotional subtext, which is used to devastating effect.Cruise, by the way, does an outstanding job, not as a trained, camera-conscious film actor, but as a mature, seasoned performer.  Here he uses his Top Gun\/Jerry Maguire suavity to malicious effect; like Ryan O'Neal's Barry Lyndon before him, he's an egotistical cad.  Unlike Lyndon, he gains our sympathy -- that's key to keeping us from disowning his character and thus negating the entire film.Kidman is given less screen time, but it matters little.  She's mostly seen in the beginning, and she has brief (but crucial) scenes throughout, and a masterful one at the end.  It is safe to say that this is her best performance to date, and those of us who have been ignoring her treasured abilities up until now (the Academy, critics, myself) will be astounded to see how far she's come since Dead Calm.  Her high points  the argument with her husband that ends by setting the film's plot in motion perfectly captures the way women lure men into arguments when the cause for one is nonexistent (and on Cruise's part, how men can't think fast enough to do anything about it), and her dream confession scene, in which she wakes laughing but becomes tearful during recollection.On a technical level, Eyes Wide Shut displays Kubrick's trademark perfectionism.  Recreating Vietnam in rural England for Full Metal Jacket must have been nearly impossible, but the unrelenting accuracy in recreating uptown and downtown New York City is absolutely stunning.  Right down to the diners and the newspaper stands; I shake my head in awe when I remind myself that Kubrick (a native Brooklynite) hasn't been to NYC in decades.  The lighting and photography is impeccable, also, as it is in every one of his films.This is the sort of film one sees more than once.  Once is good to cleanse the palate, to clear out all the residual toxins left from other recent films.

Though one might draw parallels to Lindsay Anderson's O Lucky Man! or Martin Scorsese's After Hours, Eyes Wide Shut is no less than a complete work from the cold heart and brilliant mind of Stanley Kubrick alone. It's also a furiously ingenious piece of filmmaking, one that works less on the emotions than on the senses and on the mind.  Unlike most of Kubrick's earlier work, however, it does have an emotional subtext, which is used to devastating effect.Cruise, by the way, does an outstanding job, not as a trained, camera-conscious film actor, but as a mature, seasoned performer.  Here he uses his Top Gun\/Jerry Maguire suavity to malicious effect; like Ryan O'Neal's Barry Lyndon before him, he's an egotistical cad.  Unlike Lyndon, he gains our sympathy -- that's key to keeping us from disowning his character and thus negating the entire film.Kidman is given less screen time, but it matters little.  She's mostly seen in the beginning, and she has brief (but crucial) scenes throughout, and a masterful one at the end.  It is safe to say that this is her best performance to date, and those of us who have been ignoring her treasured abilities up until now (the Academy, critics, myself) will be astounded to see how far she's come since Dead Calm.  Her high points  the argument with her husband that ends by setting the film's plot in motion perfectly captures the way women lure men into arguments when the cause for one is nonexistent (and on Cruise's part, how men can't think fast enough to do anything about it), and her dream confession scene, in which she wakes laughing but becomes tearful during recollection.On a technical level, Eyes Wide Shut displays Kubrick's trademark perfectionism.  Recreating Vietnam in rural England for Full Metal Jacket must have been nearly impossible, but the unrelenting accuracy in recreating uptown and downtown New York City is absolutely stunning.  Right down to the diners and the newspaper stands; I shake my head in awe when I remind myself that Kubrick (a native Brooklynite) hasn't been to NYC in decades.  The lighting and photography is impeccable, also, as it is in every one of his films.This is the sort of film one sees more than once.  Once is good to cleanse the palate, to clear out all the residual toxins left from other recent films.  See it again, perhaps a third time, and get to appreciate the graceful, nearly unblemished finale of a man who took the art of cinema seriously.  It's a sobering experience.

I don't think it will ever become dated--not as long as little league baseball is in existence.  I remember first seeing it at a drive-in when I was ten, shortly after my own little league season had finished.   Walter Matthau is excellent as Buttermaker, the beer-soaked coach who takes on the unwanted task of coaching a team of misfit kids who were allowed to play in the league only after a civil action law suit was won in their favor. Tatum O'Neal shines as the team's recruited pitcher Amanda, whose mother once dated Buttermaker.   A touching subplot involves the relationship between Amanda and Buttermaker which turns from distant to warm as the final game approaches.  Vic Morrow gives a frighteningly good performance as the out-to-win-no-matter-what coach of the opposing team  who was never happy with the fact that the Bears were allowed to play in the first place.  Joyce Van Patten  is also good as the butch, outspoken league supervisor.It's the kid players that really give this movie the edge.  All performances are top-notch, and director Michael Ritchie splendidly keeps the focus mostly on them and their feelings about the whole ordeal.  Stand-outs include Jackie Earl Haley as the heroic Kelly Leak and Chris Barnes as shortstop Tanner Boyle.

Lord knows how many were turned away, but those that made it in cheered as one when the lights dimmed.  Moments later, we were cheering again, whooping our appreciation of the library ghost's horrifying transformation, and then we were singing - well, shouting really -  along to the theme song, and this mood of festive celebration (it was Christmas, after all) was maintained throughout the next two hours, and it was one in which I joined as enthusiastically as anybody, despite a bladder which had been demanding urgent attention since even before the trailers had finished (and despite the slight disappointment of that giant doughman, which meant nothing to us in the UK), and long before the film's conclusion, I realised that I hadn't had so much fun on a cinema visit before, and nor have I had since.And when it had ended, and we had filed back out into the winter night (some of us via the gents), with each of our group almost taking turns to ask the rest if they had enjoyed the movie as much as he had, we began the ritual of recalling favorite moments from the film.

Instead, this one made more money than they predicted and they kept on making sequels. However, this is the final chapter for the series for a few reasons. Jason isn't dead until this one. At least, that's my opinion. In this one, he's still sort of human and bleeds from time to time. This is also the last of the series to look like it was shot by a home movie camera in the &#145;70's. But, hey, isn't that part of the charm of these movies?The movie starts off pretty cool, with a recap of the Jason legend and flashbacks from previous movies. The movie starts off immediately after Friday 3 ends. Jason's body is taken to the morgue where he isn't really dead and lots of people die. Jason makes his way back to Crystal Lake. Twelve years old Tommy and virginal teen Trish live on Crystal Lake with their mother. (Don't they get bored out there though? To me Crystal Lake has always looked boring, not to mention the fact that their phones probably don't work.) Anyway, a bunch of teens are vacationing next door and Jason has people to slaughter! Let the body count begin! Oh yeah, there's also this hunter who is out to kill Jason for killing his sister. Guess what happens to him? Tommy and Trish are left to live and Tommy shaves his head trying to look like young Jason hoping that Jason will think that Tommy is him (or something) and that way Tommy can kill Jason. Jason is really dead in this one and Tommy winds up a little crazy.  This one is more of the same but it's definitely an improvement on Part 3. For one thing, there are not zero, not one, but TWO, count them TWO real actors in this movie.

Let's not forget Crispin Glover (George McFly from the `Back To The Future' series and also `River's Edge', `Wild At Heart' and other weird movies) as `Jimbo.' Corey and Crispin alone make the movie worthwhile. Crispin's dancing is just so bad it has to be seen to be believed. When Corey goes psycho and starts hacking Jason to pieces, it's really cool.
