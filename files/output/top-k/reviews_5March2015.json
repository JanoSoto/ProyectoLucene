It's a movie existing for no one, other than whoever benefits from the tax write-off. It has been made without an ounce of passion, intelligence or interest by filmmakers who have, - stunningly - made good movies in the past. I hate THE MATRIX and want to forget it exists as soon as possible.Yet I forge on. Consider this review a warning; if you actually end up watching THE MATRIX after reading this, I never want to know you. In every way, it is beneath the standards of an original Sci-Fi movie; at least those have a little bit of gumption, a spiritedness that indicates someone within the production had fun while making it.
