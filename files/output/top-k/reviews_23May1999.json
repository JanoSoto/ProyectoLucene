I came out of the cinema really disappointed. This movie was all a war movie should NOT be.Sure, some of the war scenes were brilliant, but that's also all the good this movie has accomplished.My list of complaints about this movie is quite long. First of all those voiceovers! Whatever is the meaning of putting them there? Sure they have an important message to convey, but when they were put in as voiceovers the way they were, I almost fell to sleep during them. I think it would have been better putting the messages in as text on the screen, subtitles or scrolling text over the screen.Then you have the music. THIS IS A WAR MOVIE! Get the point! It's NOT Back To Howard's End or The Age Of Innocence! So the music in the film is really malplaced! That's one thing. Another thing is that it's there EVERY second of the film. I can't remember ONE second without music in the movie. And that's NOT a plus for a war movie. In a war movie you need scenes without music to meditate over what you've just seen. The music is also repetitive and boring. Some places it seems to be at the end of a sequence, and then it starts repeating itself over and over again. If you didn't fall asleep during the last voiceover, you might fall to sleep during the endless repetitions of the terribly malplaced, boring and repetitive music.Third the actors. The men who fight in wars are your regular John Doe's such as you and me. Not your regular celebrities as George Clooney, John Travolta, Woody Harrelson, Nick Nolte and Sean Penn. A war movie gains on using smallname actors, they give a more realistic story when the soldiers are people you don't recognize just like that. In fact this is the only bad thing I found about Saving Private Ryan too, they should've never used Tom Hanks in that movie.Apart from being bigname actors, they don't do their parts too well either. This move would have gained much on using talented, yet unknown actors. Someone the public was NOT familiar with.That's enough said about this film. In short it has a great story and great war scenes. But it's terribly made, with wrong actors, horrible music, and voiceovers straight out of hell. And when a 3-hour movie gets this boring because of that it sucks! 3\/10 is all it gets from me... And everyone I've talked to about this movie agrees with me...

The settings were gorgeous, the costumes breathtaking, and the battle scenes... well, they were pure Star Wars, through and through. The music, thanks to the brilliant John Williams, is of course magnificent (I have already bought the soundtrack and listen to it constantly).

I had just watched one of the best sword fights I'd ever seen on film, an amazing racing sequence that just pulls you right into it, some more of George Lucas' amazing creature designs. I don't know what more one could ask of a Star Wars film. (Well, Han Solo, I guess)The film's flaws are quite simple The opening was a bit slow (but once the characters land on Tatooine things really pick up), and -of course- Jar Jar Binks was *very* overused, though he does grow on you when they start cutting screen time down!But the movie's strengths more than make up for it. The action is fast paced, the effects are incredible, the sound effects were top notch, and John Williams' score is arguably the best of the series. Natalie Portman did a great job as the young Queen trying to save her people, and Ewan MacGregor did a superb job as Obi-Wan, you really felt like he was a young Alec Guinness.What I also really liked was the parallels that Lucas set up between this film and A New Hope (umm... a movie foil?). Both centre and around boys on Tatooine who crave adventure in the far reaches of the galaxy, said boy starts falling for a princess\/queen, a bad guy in black just walks on screen and redefines evil incarnate (I loved Darth Maul BTW), and finally the award ceremonies at the end of the movie. A nice version of history repeats itself, I think.On a final note, many critics have complained about flat characters that don't develop. My response How much did Luke grow in the first film?8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 May 1999","score":"","review":"  Simply put Episode 1 was just good fun.When I left the theatre after watching The Phantom Menace, I was pumped.
