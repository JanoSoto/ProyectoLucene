It's not even a good science fiction movie, it's very silly most of the time. The movie doesn't open very masterfully, but it turns out even worse when it gets to the point that it intends. The story is about a society divided into two groups citizens and civilians. In a futuristic world, citizens usually have more privileges than civilians. The very first scene of the movie describes perfectly what's the main difference between the two classes. So far so good. What does it take to be a citizen? You have to join the military forces.This is a perfect example of a movie which begins interesting (although you feel very unsafe about what's going to happen next) and self destructs completely later on. The characters (although I loved Clancy Brown!!) one more stupid than the other, go on a voyage to a military system where they'll begin training. When they hear of an alien threat that may destroy the planet Earth they go on war with the aliens. Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards look like two children on a mission to save the world, how fun!! It wasn't their performances, I guess, but their roles which dragged them down to kiss the floor. The aliens themselves are actually quite interesting. They're pretty huge bugs with deadly arms & legs which will give the movie a little sample of gore. The special effects are also stunning! But the main problem here is the alien planet itself. It's just a simple desert with lightened skies and sand everywhere. Before watching this movie, I always thought its story was told on earth.Science fiction movies which explore other planets must be innovative. They must show us something completely different than everything else we once saw or learned in order to be believable as a place light-years of distance from where we are. If a science fiction movie can't deliver that, for me, it's just lack of good imagination. Starship Troopers can't decide whether it is a serious movie or a humorist one. Those commercials are just plain stupid, giving a funny mood to the movie, taking away its credits of being a masterpiece.Paul Verhoeven is a great director though. Working with him may be very fun, because he's a really crazy man on set. He directed some classics before like RoboCop, Total Recall and Basic Instinct. I haven't seen Showgirls yet, but since he won the award for worst director for that movie (at the Razzie Awards Ceremony), I don't surprise myself so much by knowing this movie was just so uncreative.

Although he could be in bad movies, he was generally reliable for an entertaining performance. Making my way through the Val Lewton collection that has been put out on DVD, I saved the three films featuring Karloff for the end. 'Bedlam,' 'Isle of the Dead,' and 'The Body Snatcher' are all wonderful, but it is the performance of Karloff as the seedy cabman which is probably the strongest. If I may be so bold, it may even be the most entertaining performance of his career.Karloff is having a lot of fun in 'The Body Snatcher' and shamelessly chews up every scene he's in. He has a great scene with a very sick looking Bela Lugosi and it is one of the most memorable moments in a great film. His exchanges with Henry Daniell are terrific. These are scenes that exude menace and malevolence, impishness, inferiority, contempt, -- and they all come from the mocking grin of Karloff. I even find his voice work memorable at the end of the film when he is chanting a crescendo of never neveR neVER NEVER NEVER GET AWAY WITH IT! For me Boris Karloff could do nothing wrong with his performance in 'The Body Snatchers.' He elevated Henry Daniell, Bela Lugosi and everyone else involved.Robert Wise's direction is really just fantastic. He has great set pieces (how can you not be moved by the fate of the little dog in the graveyard?). He establishes tremendous tension (the girl who sings in the street at night anyone?). Most importantly? He has great payoffs with the two scenes I've mentioned above but especially the final scene about the carriage ride home. We're such a cynical and jaded audience now (ok, just me! ha!) that, yes, you will probably know what to expect in the final scene. The lead up to it though is extremely well done. Are there supernatural forces at work or just a guilty conscience? Val Lewton, Boris Karloff and Robert Wise leave it up for you to decide.

By pure coincidence a mental guy breaks free from his shackles, murders a warden and somehow manages to escape trouble free into the back of the car the actresses came in (!).In this type of film it's unfortunate for the audience to know who the killer is immediately as often that is half the fun. The fact that the killer decides to don a rather spooky owl mask for the rest of the film, and with the claustrophobic setting of the theatre that the group were locked in, it would have been a lot more fun to play 'guess the killer'.The death scenes were OK by slasher standard but not really worth noting. Apart from a struggle between one of the actors and the murderer, and the girl they are fighting over gets torn in half! Although this happens off-screen, it is amusing when the guy falls over and the top-half of the girl lands on him.There is pretty poor acting throughout and none of the characters were worth caring for. In fact, character development is so insignificant in this film that I didn't even realise the 'main character' was the main character until the end when she survived. This was also a rather ridiculous scene as the caretaker somehow manages to shoot the killer between the eyes despite being at an angle that from which it would have been impossible to do so, then (perhaps preparing for a sequel?) the killer wakes up!

I've just watched Snow White for the umpteenth time, and decided it's still as wondrous and lustrous as ever. The music, humour, and animation are stuck magically in the 1930's but it all seems as timeless as the story itself. The best place to see it is in a cinema of course, the same as my daughter and I did over and over again before Disney released it on video in '94.All available positive epithets (magnificent, amazing, stupendous etc) apply to this one, nearly a 10 in my book. For good or bad SW will never be surpassed, because of capitalist pressures to ensure everything makes money animation designed and drawn by human beings has lost out to the precise but soulless computer. Ditto music with tunes and marvellous lyrics played well. Gentle humour that the entire family can appreciate has given way to appreciation of smut and cynicism. And that's just Disney! My favourite bits The song Wishing, and looking up the well at SW; the dwarfs first seeing her SW in their beds asleep; the dwarfs' washing sequence and song. The only thing I never liked was the apparently rushed ending - the dwarfs are looking after SW's inanimate body through the seasons, this handsome guy comes along, kisses her and they both skedaddle into the massive sunset at warp speed! I think I wanted it to last another couple of hours.Overall, to my feeble mind this is High Art!

Good natured Sal who only wants to preserve village life, becomes a sexual predator, approaching the level of Sharon Stone, as she entraps Richard in her Black Widow clutches. Etienne takes a minor role upon reaching the beach, swiftly giving up Francoise, and becoming a hermit in the forest with the injured Swede. Many of the more powerful (or more controversial) scenes from the book are cut from the movie, giving the feel that the director was reined in by his funders. References to Vietnam are abbreviated to a single shot of a fan, while Richard's re-accuring dreams about Daffy are replaced by a brief sequence toward the end. Perhaps most shockingly of all, the books surprise ending, truly dystopian in it's screaming climax, is replaced by the rather weaker idea of the inhabitants of the beach sailing away on a homemade raft, and joining modern society for Cyber Cafes and coffee. Perhaps if this film can be seen as a separate entity altogether from it's written counterpart, then it would be a pretty good film. Certainly the CGI beach looks pretty good, the acting is of decent quality and the film is not without it's charms.

Contrary to its actual California locale, it has a wonderful Old World feeling to it, probably both because of the vineyard setting and the close, traditional family (albeit Mexican), their strong attachment to their land, and their strict, pleasantly old fashioned moral standards. It tells the story of a married chocolate salesman, Paul, who has just returned from World War II. During a bus ride, he meets an unmarried pregnant girl named Victoria, who is returning home from college to help her family with their grape harvest. Paul gallantly offers to help Victoria, who fears her Old World father's stern disapproval of her pregnancy, by agreeing to pose as her husband for just one night. He will then leave in the morning, casting her in a sympathetic light as an abandoned wife. However, various circumstances prolong Paul's visit with the family (who have quite taken to him). He soon comes to realize his genuine love for the beautiful Victoria and, while trying to explain these feelings to her hot tempered father, Alberto, a fight ensues that sets the family vineyards ablaze.The film is noteworthy especially for its spectacular scenery and amazing cinematography, those magnificent vineyard panoramas. Of course there is a grape stomping scene! Another is particularly memorable, where the family members are all valiantly trying to protect the vines from frost by fanning the grapes with hot air. All tremendously touching and dramatic. The unusual movie title arises from the name of the family vineyard, Las Nubes (the clouds).Anthony Quinn is the film's real star, in my opinion, giving an amazing portrayal of Victoria's eccentric grandfather, Don Pedro.*** WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD ***It is noteworthy and admirable that, while Victoria flirts with Paul and the two share obvious passionate feelings, the couple does not have sex. However, the end cheats a bit so we can have the lovely fairy tale ending we all want. Paul nobly returns to his wife, only to discover that she has just had sex with another guy! She gives Paul his annulment papers, claiming they made a mistake marrying so young because of the war, before they really knew each other. So now he can return to Victoria and live happily ever after. I think screenwriters dumb down the plot & character portrayal in love triangles by either killing off the spouse or, as is the case here, having the spouse engaging in their own affair and asking for a divorce. It's just too easy, too convenient, and the lovers get the happy ending they want without being portrayed as villains.However, it's absolutely wonderful otherwise so I'm still giving it a high rating.

(However, I personally have a 'difficulty' or two, and I suspect so might she.) Meg Ryan (Sally) is cute and fresh, and Billy Crystal (Harry) charming and funny. The movie asks that age old question...can two people of opposite gender remain just friends, or will sex intrude upon the friendship? The couple in question, Harry and Sally, meet right after college while sharing a car trip. During the drive, they bicker and take an immediate dislike to one another, concluding that they have nothing in common. Five years later when their paths again cross, Harry is engaged and Sally has a businessman boyfriend. After another five years, they meet again; Harry's wife has just left him, and Sally's boyfriend is out of the picture. The two become great friends, sharing witty barbs, ideas and opinions, confidences and support.Then one night, Harry and Sally sleep together. Will their friendship survive? Will it develop into a deeper relationship? Will he still respect her in the morning or will he bolt? The last part of the movie answers these questions, with a wonderful humdinger of a romantic New Years Eve ending. It's a really fun, amusing, witty, touching, feel good comedy romance. Wonderful endearing stars with great chemistry together, whether as enemies, friends, or eventually lovers. HOWEVER...Sadly, it reflects the morality of our times. No more friendship, love, marriage, and sex in that precise order. Now it's perceived as novel that Harry and Sally enjoy such a lengthy friendship before having sex. Well, I guess that's preferable to just rushing the newly acquainted couple straight to bed, as is the general case in modern cinema (and life). It's a cute story, but let's just not hold it up as the ideal. One reviewer noted that Harry and Sally had to sleep together before cementing a romantic relationship, in order to determine whether or not they were sexually compatible. I'll let that pass, other than to voice disagreement. Also, the legendary restaurant scene where Sally fakes a orgasm. Okay, yes, I suppose it might be considered (marginally) funny, but it simply made me wonder whether the screenplay writers had been watching too many shampoo commercials.

Even though this happens all the time, I do believe that a lot of critics were wrong about this movie&#133; I think this is a great movie. I love the setting, the giant bugs, the impossibly handsome cast and the impossible odds. This is the kind of movie that makes you wonder why you never joined the army&#133; Even though you know it's never going to be like that, you still hope it would be. Well, at least that's what I was thinking.The war statements, the war recruitments, the plot outline or even the selection of the cast in this movie are a bit over the top, but the same thing can be said about Dr. Strangelove. Don't worry I'm not comparing this movie with Kubrick's masterpiece, I'm just pointing out that Dr. Strangelove also has a (support) cast with over the top caricatures that a movie like this really needs. They feel right for this movie.About the political statement the movie tries to make, I do believe that war makes fascists of us all. The military planners in this movie called for a swift and direct strike at the enemy. Of course everything goes to hell. Misinformation, bad planning, manipulation of the public, a poor understanding of the enemy and underestimation of enemy forces turns the quick strike in to a long and bloody operation that does more harm than good to the heroic good guys. With the capture of the Brain Bug, the war has just begun. Does this sound familiar? I know it's pretty easy to make this comparison now but this movie can be compared to a lot of modern western wars. The movie tries to make a point (with an exclamation mark) but also tries to make it with a big nod.If you want to see an entertaining action flick with hot chicks and cool dudes battling legions of bugs against impossible odds, than this is the movie for you. If you want to see a nice parody on modern warfare and the western civilization that supports it, than this is also the movie for you. Just decide for yourself what you want this movie to be.I gave this movie a rating of 10 stars not because I think this is the best movie ever (One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest holds that title), but because of the entertainment value of this movie.

Maybe it's Simon Beaufoy's solid screenplay, or the fact that the past explains every action and, unlike typical romantic comedies, characters know each other and don't fall in love within days.What makes the picture dynamic and enjoyable is that there are not only two main characters, or only one love story. The plot shows the lives of two families encountered (one separated) by one peculiar (yes) activity hairdressing. The annual British Hairdressing competition takes place in Keighley, a little town. This competition, declares the mayor Tony (Warren Clarke) Will change the history of this town.Raymond Robertson (Bill Nighy), the world champion, assists the competition with his daughter Christine (Rachael Leigh Cook) alongside him. She'll be one of his models, given that the competition consists on different kinds of hair styles done to different people. Robertson is scared for only one man from Keighley who could enter the competition Phil Allen (Alan Rickman).Allen cuts hairs in a local barbershop with his son Brian (Josh Hartnett), but has been out of competitions for ten years, since the day his wife Shelley (Natasha Richardson) ran away with his model Sandra (Rachel Griffiths) in a lesbian affair that left him all alone.

It's a light comedy not written all that well (yes I know sorry Babaloo but it really isn't that good not even close) that hops skips and jumps.

Winkler is so totally laid back and the plot continually turns macabre against him. Keaton is so over the top you're likely to feel like Winkler by the end of the movie (which might be the idea). Keaton's supposed to be the one who's so good here, but his character is just downright stupid - an ass. Which isn't really funny at all. Nope - Shelley saves the day. Keaton you can kick and leave in a back alley and things will be really fine - he's not even close to being critical to the plot line - but dump Shelley back there and Ron Howard's venture dies.Look for a very noodle-like Mr Noodle here - in other words Kevin Costner. The party scene. He's the one marching behind Keaton. Shannen Doherty is supposedly in here too but I haven't seen her and mostly likely won't hurry back to look again. (They say she's in the lift; I still won't go back, as in 'go back for what'.) For that matter there are a lot of familiar faces in here. You might not know their names, but you'll go 'oh yeah so-and-so'.Some familiar music, some of which you may like; some nice moments - the first breakfast scene is nice; some sentimentality; but don't look for a story that makes too much sense and has you feeling totally good inside by the end, for you won't be like that - you'll feel somewhat empty but of course not fully empty.

Winkler is so totally laid back and the plot continually turns macabre against him. Keaton is so over the top you're likely to feel like Winkler by the end of the movie (which might be the idea). Keaton's supposed to be the one who's so good here, but his character is just downright stupid - an ass. Which isn't really funny at all. Nope - Shelley saves the day. Keaton you can kick and leave in a back alley and things will be really fine - he's not even close to being critical to the plot line - but dump Shelley back there and Ron Howard's venture dies.Look for a very noodle-like Mr Noodle here - in other words Kevin Costner. The party scene. He's the one marching behind Keaton. Shannen Doherty is supposedly in here too but I haven't seen her and mostly likely won't hurry back to look again. (They say she's in the lift; I still won't go back, as in 'go back for what'.) For that matter there are a lot of familiar faces in here. You might not know their names, but you'll go 'oh yeah so-and-so'.Some familiar music, some of which you may like; some nice moments - the first breakfast scene is nice; some sentimentality; but don't look for a story that makes too much sense and has you feeling totally good inside by the end, for you won't be like that - you'll feel somewhat empty but of course not fully empty. It's the screenplay - hopping skipping jumping - contrived.But totally bad it's not, although were it not for Shelley it might be. It just isn't a total turn-on.

We've had this one on the shelf for the longest time without ever trying it out. I can't remember why we bought it.It doesn't have the world's best screenplay or the world's most thought out story line. It's - how should one say? It's a light comedy not written all that well (yes I know sorry Babaloo but it really isn't that good not even close) that hops skips and jumps.

I found it very original and compelling, especially the Holnist camp images and the escape scenes. If this film hadn't preceded the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I would say that it had copied the style and themes of LOR, in its musical score, photography, set locations, battles, etc. Since it came first however, I just applaud its artistic integrity and accomplishments. I haven't read the book, and the story wasn't written by Tolkein, but the picture of menacing evil ambition is consummately portrayed. I've never seen Will Patton before, but his General Bethlehem is an eye-opener. The movie's general insight into men's (and women's) conflicting motivations is quite good.I found the first 2 hours spotless and exhilarating, even if the insemination scene ruled out the possibility of my kids watching the whole film. Where does it come up short? I found Costner's postman not to be likable in the end. He seemed to be shamed into the good things he did. He had some kind of conversion at the Bridge City dam when a child demanded to know What's a postman? but did his character change? or just adapt? I tended to agree with General Bethlehem that the postman didn't believe in anything worth fighting for, and when the postman cried out, I believe in the United States of America (or whatever) it rang a little hollow, even if it won him the fight. So, the postman movement was over-emphasized (although Ford Lincoln Mercury was great) and the postman himself was too ambivalent about it.I think of this as one of Costner's concept movies, like Field of Dreams and Dances with Wolves. I really appreciate them, and the fact that they take you for an exciting ride, opening up new visions of our reality. Will he ever produce, direct and star in Cooper's The Red Rover? I hope so.
