The plot is absurd, and the dialog is ridiculous. This movie is really entertaining to watch, however. I have no idea whether or not this movie is intentionally funny. I don't see it billed as a satire or a comedy, so I gave it 4 for being unintentionally (supposedly) funny. Josh Hartnett's face literally can't show emotion. I've seen like 7 of his movies, and I'm convinced now of this. Prepare for that dead-eyed look on his face the entire movie YET AGAIN.Elijah Wood is trying. But he just doesn't look his part. He looks like a dork but he doesn't play one that would rise to the occasion as much as his part calls for. Jon Stewart's goatee. Shooter McGavin is in this movie. Hyde is in this movie. Salma Hayek and Jordana Brewster are crazy hot and bad in this movie.If you're like me and enjoy well-known people in bad movies, this is your movie. If you want a competent horror or thriller movie, this is literally the worst choice you can make.
