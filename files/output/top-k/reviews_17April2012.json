I remember when I first saw the film in 1999, I was eleven years old, and even then I was obsessed with it. Not really the first movie you would imagine a young child watching and actually enjoying, I think I enjoyed the true human nature displayed in this film. Sure, it is depressing, bleak, and our characters are all broken and despairing about something, and I can see how some people might not find these types of characters to be likable, but they are pretty real. These characters are real. Sure, there are some that I like less than others, but each one plays a part, and I think the idea was intriguing to me then (and it still is now, thirteen years later) that these people could be so close to one another without even realizing it until they actually crossed paths.There is really too much going on here in 'Magnolia' for any one critic to respond to at one time. Personally, I think the fact that Paul Thomas Anderson even achieved filming this is extraordinary in itself, let alone the fact that he wrote and directed. I think the reason why I love films like 'Magnolia' so much is because there is something new to be experienced every time you watch it. Even the parts that I feel should be boring, dull, or uninteresting, I am just glued to the screen. There are far too many actors to single out very many, but mostly notable for me are Tom Cruise who I am really not the biggest fan of, but absolutely love him here, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and John C. Reilly who does an excellent job in a serious role, solidifying my belief that he is a brilliant actor who will one day be honored with an Oscar award. I wish Orlando Jones's scenes had actually made it to the film, so maybe I need to seek out a DVD copy of this film so I can indulge in the special features.'Magnolia' I guess is really a hit or miss type of film, but take it from me, this is a beautiful mosaic.'Magnolia' is true art.MAGNOLIA -----10\/10.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"17 April 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Paul Thomas Anderson wrote and directed this. There are 11 principle characters in this mosaic of intertwining lives in Magnolia Drive in Los Angeles. The action takes place during one day in the lives of these people. From the inadequate catholic cop (John C. Reilly), to the over powering sex instructor (Tom Cruise), all of the cast of Magnolia are really great. Tom Cruise is the stand out however----he almost levitates into the stratosphere as he struts his stuff. The stories are not happy ones....the dying Philip Baker Hall (who cant remember if he molested his daughter)...the dying Jason Robards...the junkie Melora Waltons...the tormented boy genius Jeremy Blackman...the even MORE tormented old boy genius William H. Macy ...the mentally unstable Jullianne Moore ...the confused male nurse Philip Seymour Hoffman...the boy geniuses abusive father Michael Bowen. There is almost no humor here at all. It is well done (profesional) but there are reasons why it was not any where near a box office success. When all the characters start singing--each in his own-- way (and ON his own) the movie strays dangerously near the label Pretentious. The heavy shower of frogs was another leap towards the pretentiousness that the director was probably trying to avoid. I know a lot of people have been trying to analyze this movie. That surprises me---because its all very simple. Its all there before your eyes. I think its far too dark----too humorless. In the final analyses it IS pretentious, but its not a bad movie. Its really quite interesting at times. Warning !! If you LOVE frogs you may be upset during this movie.(If you are French...you may become hungry.)
