[{"date":"20 February 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" October SKY is a film that is sorely needed right now, a film to buoy our spirits and re- launch our sense of wonder. Based on a true story - ROCKET BOYS by Homer. H. Hickam, Jr. - it is everything young people should see to remind them that dreams are indeed possible. The story takes place in the little mining town of Coalwood, West Virginia in 1957 when all eyes were focused on the seemingly unreal launching of Russia's Sputnik. Homer, Jr. (Jake Gyllenhaal, with all of his innate charm intact even then!) longs to get away from his presumed destiny of working in the coal mines upon graduation from high school. But Homer's ideals are higher and with the aid of his friends he designs and launches a little rocket that at first angers his miner father (Chris Cooper) but excites his teacher (Laura Dern), who assists Homer in his dreams of rising above the frustrating level of his life in the little town to accomplish dreams he never thought possible. There is just the right amount of tender humor, status resistance, and recreation of a period of time in our history when suddenly everything was possible if a rocket could place a satellite in orbit and transmit signals to the earth. For those of us who lived it this film is an enriching memory, and for those who didn't witness it, the film offers a true sense of the possibilities of the open human spirit. It is a delightful little film.
