But his world doesn't entirely crumble around him... until his old poker playing buddy gets released from prison. By one hour and forty minutes into the film, he's broke, his girlfriend has left him, he's been badly beaten, he owes a KGB fellow $15,000 tomorrow, he also owes the Chesterfield $6,000 (Famke Jensen's underground club) and his law career is virtually over before it began.

Anyone who knows me knows that the only reason I rented this DVD was because of a certain name appearing in the credited cast. That, in a nutshell, is the problem with She's All That. Instead of trying to build a credible drama or comedy with three-dimensional characters, it dissolves rapidly into a farcical study in how much happier we would all be if we thought alike, looked alike, and acted alike. Were it not for the ever-wonderful Anna Paquin making use of a role that benefits no end from her easygoing, honest acting style, I would swear that writer R. Lee Fleming Jr. is a pseudonym for the revolting Ronald Bass. Take a character each from glorified soapies like Charmed or Beverly Hills 987whatever, dump them onto celluloid, mix them in a bowl, and throw them at the screen. The resultant image will not look much different to what you see here. And that's a terrible shame, because in spite of appearing in some terrible pieces, Rachael Leigh Cook has proved she is capable of far better.Then again, I should have been able to predict disaster was in the air when I saw that the cast list featured both Freddie Prinze Jr. and Matthew Lillard, known after Wing Commander by casting agents as the gruesome twosome. Even the central premise is lifted wholesale from teenie flicks that did it far better. In a nutshell, Freddie bets his obnoxious friends after being dumped by the sort of woman I would describe as no big loss that he can take the sort of woman he and his fellow airheads consider less than attractive, then make her over to be the conception these morons have of attractive. It is like trying to put the body of a Lamborghini over the engine of a 1920s Model T or the like. You can polish that bodywork until the beholder sees his own reflection in it, but at the end of the day, the thing will still move like a Model T. And with the exception of Anna Paquin, the entire cast that the bodywork is going over here is incredibly ugly. Writers who fail to realise that humanity's virtues come from its members' differences are already a dime a dozen.But to be fair to the film, Ebert has a good point when he says that it is the details that rescue the film from being entirely a write-off. To use Ebert's words, I was grateful that at least someone could take this weary material and do something with it. Minor details peppered over the main story, such as Kevin Pollak's enthusiasm for Jeopardy, give She's All That a laugh quotient in spite of a central premise that would otherwise become offensive. Indeed, it is somewhat indicative of the cast's quality when one struggles to remember what the first-billed stars of the film have to say for themselves, but any memories one has of said film are all tied to the supports. Freddie Prinze Jr. has gone three fifths of nowhere since She's All That, and no wonder given that he comes off here as something of a fourth-rate Keanu Reeves. I used to joke a lot about Keanu's woodenness, but after River's Edge, I am starting to compare his performance there to Freddie's in She's All That and wonder if maybe we are being just a little unfair to Reeves. At least his blank expression became useful towards the end of My Own Private Idaho.Once upon a time, I told a fellow aspiring writer that the best way to build a character is by reinforcing the audience's impression of them with their actions. Going to the exact opposite end of the cinematic scale and using C'era Una Volta Il West as an example, Sergio Leone made Frank an unforgettable character by showing him shooting a child dead after one of his men calls him by name. And that is one major problem in films like She's All That. The characters are all speech. We are told that character X is this or that by character Y, and the writer expects us to take character Y at their word. With no act on which to balance the verbal descriptions of the character, we are left with little more than a bunch of talking heads. Or a ninety-minute episode of Beverly Hills 12345, if you will. The characters in this mess that do feel like more than a cardboard cut-out are exactly those that should not in comparison to the stars. I know I have said that several times now, but one cannot emphasise that part enough.I gave She's All That a four out of ten. Two of those stars are for Kevin Pollak and Anna Paquin. Between them, they firmly act everyone else in the film under the table. If you are a fan of either of those two, and a rabid completist, then She's All That is worth a look. Otherwise, don't bother.

George said he wanted an emotional ending between Luke and his father and with the Emperor in the mix that is exactly what we got.The beginning of the film and another reviewer said serves mainly to reunite the main characters and tie up any loose ands regarding Jabba the Hutt and Han's 'previous' life. The tension really starts building up in the 2nd half of return of the Jedi and its completely unmissable! The effects are still stunning and hold up today. The simultaneous three way battle at the end (Luke\/Lando\/Han and Leia) is brilliantly done. The cutting between scenes is very appropriately done to alleviate and create tension at the right times making the ending that much more dramatic. Now as for the ewoks..some people don't seem to understand they are for comic relief...the battle between Luke\/Vader\/Emperor is so tense our poor little nerves can't take it and we NEED the comic relief provided by some of the scenes in that battle. And the fact that primitive simplistic ewoks defeat the technological over complicated Empire is very appropriate reason overcomes technology...a statement on 20th century life.Back to the lightsabre battle. The action isn't as fast or breath taking even as in the Empire Strikes back. But that is good because it doesn't take focus away from the emotional centre of the story. That scene in the Death Srat is more, talking, goading and tension, rather than action which is appropriate. The Emperor's death is poetic justice at its most subliminal. How can anyone not grin as he falls down the shaft...well either grin or just reel back in shock that Ani has FINALLY done it...fulfilled the prophecy. This is why the links with the prequel trilogy are important. When Vader dies and we see him burning on the funeral pyre it is sombre yet surprisingly not too sad. This is because it fits; he is at peace and has come to his natural end. It was similar with Padme's death in Return of the Sith; she had had enough of life, she died at peace knowing she had brought new life into the galaxy and that there was good left in Anakin; for this reason her death was more sombre than sad per se. It is fitting that the deaths of Anakin and Padme are thus juxtaposed and linked.The ending...what is it but happy...the happiest and most uplifting of all the Star Wars films. It is really a complete and finished ending to a magnificent saga of films. I get choked up every time I see it. Reliving the many previous hours of emotions and what the Star Wars galaxy and I have gone through to get to that point.Absolutely brilliant sum it up?

It's actually a very simple ethic, about being able to confront crisis without fear assume that you're probably already dead, and then just do your job.Despite the fact that this is in many ways a very American ethic - it's implicit in the essays of Emerson and Thoreau, and in the fiction of Melville and Fenimore Cooper, it was the ethic that Lincoln lived throughout his presidency - It's not very popular among Americans. For instance, gung-ho war lovers like to pay lip service to the ethic, but they don't actually believe they're ever going to die, and all they want to do is cause death and suffering, even when it's not part of any job. And of course it doesn't appeal to touchy-feely types because sometimes dying and causing death are indeed part of the job.Of course, professionalism is only part of the issue; the real trick is recognizing when others need help, and when it's best to let them help themselves. That's the core of the relationship between John Wayne and Dean Martin in Rio Bravo if Martin wants to straighten out, Wayne is willing to help; if Martin wants to go on being the town drunk, let him do so and be damned.This facet of the ethic becomes the pivotal point in Carpenter's film that leads the condemned murderer to decide to throw his lot in with the besieged police.I go on about this for a simple reason - this ethic not only forms the basis of Assault on Precinct 13; it forms the basis of the career of director John Carpenter. Scratch a little beneath the surface of any of his films, and it's there, crystal clear, in a dozen variation. Consider this in terms of Starman The alien, played by Jeff Bridges, is a professional diplomat; he's here to say greetings, earthlings. But since most earthlings are too scared to pay attention, then, even though dying, he's going back to the head office on his home planet to make his report. The earthlings can fend for themselves, and goodbye.Although there are variants of this ethic available in other cultures (for instance the Japanese samurai code), this essential form of it that Carpenter promotes remains intrinsically American (none of his professionals are committing suicide for it, which a good samurai needs to do in extreme situations). So it remains bewildering - and frankly a little sad - that most Americans, whatever they say about this ethic, refuse to live it, choosing to remain secure in their fears.Well, none of this would mean anything here, unless John carpenter were a good director and Assault on Precinct 13 a good movie. To be sure, it has some of the same chintziness and lapses of pacing one sees a lot in independent films made throughout the '60s and '70s (the most notorious of which being Romero's Night of the Living Dead). But there are some striking visuals, the cast of unknowns is certainly game to play their best, the action is clean and violent (actually very hard to accomplish in a low-budget independent film). If part of the film's ethic is professionalism, than Carpenter has to present his audience with a relatively professional job despite a lack of adequate resources. I think he accomplishes this.By no means the best example of American independent film, but a necessary beginning to the career of one of America's most interesting filmmakers of the past 40 years.

She seems as famous for giving her children strange names as she is for her acting career, which seems to have stalled in recent years. But go back to 1998 and she seemed to be everywhere, normally playing an English character. This, arguably, is her finest hour as this is a romantic movie with a rare intelligence and a daring approach to telling its story.Paltrow plays Helen, a twenty-something PR executive living with her writer-boyfriend Gerry (John Lynch) in London. One day, she goes into work to find out that she's been fired. Distressed, she goes to catch a Tube train back home and it's at this point that the film takes an unusual twist. First, we see Helen board the train and then a second Helen misses it. The film then continues telling Helen's story from both angles which run simultaneously, showing how much can change after such a simple difference.Sliding Doors is to be commended for daring to do something different, basically providing two films for the price of one. Unfortunately, neither film is a runaway success. It's only when they intersect and cross each other's paths that you appreciate the film for what it is. Paltrow works hard in the dual lead roles but the only real difference between the two Helens are their haircuts. Keeping pace with both stories at the same time is tricky, at first, but all the more rewarding when you get your head around it. Her co-stars, Lynch and John Hannah, are less impressive. Lynch is suitably slimy as Helen's boyfriend while Hannah comes across exactly like a Scottish Hugh Grant, stammering in all the right places and getting suitably tongue-tied at the right moments. The other problem I have with Sliding Doors is that it isn't a side-splitting romantic comedy. It has its moments, though I can't think any at the moment. It's more of a serious study into relationships than a hilarious dual-layered comedy - it's not exactly There's Something About Mary, still my favourite rom-com.There aren't many films like Sliding Doors out there. Rom-coms aren't known for being intelligent and different but this film deserves attention for trying to break free from the usual conventions. Unfortunately, it's not a great film - it feels far longer than its 100 minute duration and it isn't as entertaining as it should be. I also felt it had a strong anti-men feel to it as the few male characters in the film are either spineless worms, lying cheaters or leering lager louts. Even the bitchy ex (Jeanne Tripplehorn), despite being a thoroughly nasty piece of work, gets a smoother ride than the men. It's definitely a chick-flick (like most of my Better Half's DVD collection) but I would still just about recommend Sliding Doors, purely because it's a refreshing change from the norm. I just think that it could have been so much better - there is so much potential here, writer\/director Peter Howitt doesn't quite know what to do with it. Persevere and maybe watch it twice, in case you don't get it the first time.

It honestly boggles my mind to see how the franchise went from a blockbuster starring Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman and Christopher Reeve, to a piece of tripe starring Reeve and Hackman as caricatures of themselves. It feels like everyone is just hamming it up in this picture, which is a shame because the actors could have done so much more with their roles.The plot is a total waste of time and space. Who cares about ever being in danger, because no matter who you are around the world, Superman will save you! Whether it's Russian cosmonauts in space or conveniently-timed subway train problems, it seems that Superman can actually sense problems in advance! That's...really stupid. And apparently, Superman is all-knowing enough that he can just ask every single world leader to disarm their nuclear arsenals, and that they will comply WITHOUT HESITATION. I mean, it's not like some of those countries based their entire economies on the development of nuclear power, right? Right? There are some really terrible special effects shots in this film. It's plainly obvious to see, because there is footage recycled from the earlier entries in the series, bizarre effect shots (most notably, one instance where Superman flies through space with his cape flapping (???), and another instance in which he flies through a subway station, and the extras don't even bother turning to look at him!), some truly horrid green screen work (in the Fortress Of Solitude with the elders and the 1\/3'rd size Superman flying through the subway!), and just plain strange visual effects (Superman repairing the Great Wall Of China with some random green beam that came out of his eyes!). Needless to say, this is not the shining hallmark of glory in the FX department.Character development? Ha! Forget it! Superman still acts like a bumbling fool, Lex Luthor is STILL a conniving clown, and it actually looks like Lois Lane has regressed in intelligence and thought from the first film. Then again, there is Nuclear Man, who barely even has a vocabulary, so I guess we should be thankful for that development.Bottom Line It's terrible, no doubt about that. I give this film a 1 out of 10, the lowest rating. Seriously, ANYTHING is better than this. Go watch the first one to see how the character was done right.

(Are we detecting a trend here? Fun?)Wayne the Fireman-wanna be. He is an archetype - everyone at one time or another has known Wayne. Everyone has known the blustery, clueless police lieutenant and the witless, large, 'clean and shiny' brothers and Ted Levine as General Woodman, the military bad guy archetype. I've seen some complaints about Levine's performance as simply playing the stereotyped bad guy, but just as he is for Detective Adrian Monk, he was an admirable foil\/straight man for Duchovny. I can't really think of who would have been a better General Woodman to Duchovny's Ira Kane.As for the Governor - it was nice to see an older Dan Akroyd do his schtick. His performance was less intense than his Bassomatic bit but I think Dan nailed the good old boy, get-to-the-point, smooth-but-bossy politician, as only Akroyd could do it (and minus any hint of a Chicago-land accent).And finally, the lamented (in some few comments) performance of Olando Jones Orlando is Orlando. Orlando playing against type...I can't even imagine that in this movie. This was not the vehicle for Orlando to make a run for an Oscar.

I think sitting down with my 9 year old son and having some good laughs was like taking a shower from the grit and grime of the World's problems.

There is a secret agent hero, a psychopathic villain bent on world domination, a beautiful heroine, exotic locations (Seville and Sydney), a McGuffin which the hero and villain are trying to get hold of and the obligatory car chases. The hero is Ethan Hunt, an operative for a highly secretive US government agency. The villain is Sean Ambrose, a renegade member of the same organisation and the heroine is Nyah Nordoff-Hall, a professional thief and (in a typical Bond-like touch) Ambrose's former girlfriend. The McGuffin is a lethal virus developed by a corrupt pharmaceuticals tycoon and which Ambrose is trying to steal along with the antidote so that he can hold the world to ransom. Although the hero is an American, the villain, heroine and Hunt's boss (equivalent to Bond's M) are all British; Nyah, despite her exotic name and looks, speaks in the tones of an English public schoolgirl. Nyah and Hunt become romantically involved; a rare example of an inter-racial romance in an American film. The film, however, lacks certain essential ingredients of the Bond formula. The Bond films, at their most stylish, are distinguished by a lightness of touch and a careful balance between excitement and humour. Mission Impossible 2, however, takes itself completely seriously and has very little humour. Connery, Moore, Dalton and Brosnan all interpreted James Bond in their own ways, but he always emerged as a rounded, believable character with his own personality. Tom Cruise's Hunt, by contrast, comes across as devoid of personality, comparable only with Bond as interpreted by the inert George Lazenby. Dougray Scott does his best with Ambrose, but he does not emerge as a particularly memorable villain in the Bond tradition. Thandie Newton, who was so impressive in films like Flirting and Jefferson in Paris, seems wasted as Nyah.This is the only one of the Mission Impossible films that I have seen, and it has not inspired me to go to the video store to rent the original or to the cinema to see the recent Mission Impossible 3. It has confirmed some of the doubts I had about Tom Cruise. In his early Top Gun or Cocktail period he seemed a handsome but shallow matinée idol but then matured into a very good actor in intelligent films like Rain Man, Born on the Fourth of July, A Few Good Men and Eyes Wide Shut. Unfortunately, he has also shown a tendency to act in some ill-advised vanity projects, often with himself as producer, and these have rarely shown him at his best. Thus we had the interminably dull Far and Away, the virtually incomprehensible Vanilla Sky and The Last Samurai. This last was not my favourite film, largely because of Cruise's overacting and its regrettable and historically ignorant tendency to glamorise Japanese militarism, but at least making an epic set in the Japan of the 1870s showed a laudable ambition to go beyond Hollywood's normal range.Mission Impossible 2, by contrast, shows no ambition at all; it is just a bog-standard shoot-em-up action adventure of the sort that Hollywood's lesser talents can make with their eyes closed. If Mr Cruise must indulge himself in vanity productions, he should find something worthier of his talents than trying to become another Schwarzenegger or Segal. He should certainly set his sights higher than becoming the George Lazenby of the twenty-first century. 4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 June 2006","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Mission Impossible 2 borrows many of the traditional elements of the trusted formula which proved so successful in the James Bond series.

In some respects the answer is yes, yet these are technical analyses of product. I've never had to do that with Field of Dreams. It is itself and defies scrutiny as would Gandhi defy psychoanalysis. It is, to itself, true. The cast are great. To this day, despite much, I like Kevin Costner. My sole concern is, why the hell can't I buy Shoeless Joe, the novel upon which it was based and which I read in the late eighties? It contains much more background and is, in itself, an absorbing read.

This was the director's penultimate work, and the one which holds testament to an artist's ability to embrace the fundamental genres of contemporary cinema. Such versatility is surely commendable; nevertheless, Kubrick unwittingly crafted what many would agree to be the worst of his career. In a decade of numerous anti-war features, produced in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, it is hard understanding why someone of Kubrick's calibre actually made this predicament of whimsical proportions. That is not to say this is not something of good intentions, but rather a work which drives its message home to such a degree that it conflicts the nature of its artist.Released seven years following The Shining, Full Metal Jacket marked the second Kubrick picture of the '80s. Twelve years later, Eyes Wide Shut was released posthumously a few months following Kubrick's death. I say this simply to note that Kubrick fortunately avoided finishing on such a questionable feature. The project was first penned in 1980, with the director considering directing a holocaust study, but eventually he opted for something Vietnam based. Two years later, the director stumbled upon The Short-Timers; a retrospective, semi-autobiographical novel written by war veteran Gustav Hasford. Screenwriter Michael Herr (previously famed for his other Vietnam screenplay, Apocalypse Now) was asked to write an adapted screenplay and while originally reluctant to do so, he eventually agreed. The screenplay eventually earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay.Prior to filming, Kubrick spent many years researching the entire period of war; pouring over memoirs, documentaries, newspaper cuttings and any related information which could possibly contribute to the overall accuracy of the project. His commitment and dedication to being informed was a tradition Kubrick adopted before embarking on any film-making venture. As with Paths of Glory, it is purportedly claimed that Kubrick was not concerned in shaping a manifestation of anti-war, but instead wanted to matter-of-factly depict the nature of war, i.e. men transformed into killers.Commencing with a montage of young army recruits having their hair shaved off (allegory for the beginnings of dehumanisation), you instantly recognise that you are watching something relatively unique. The sudden cut to the army barracks, the stillness of the blank room and the abrupt barrage of profanity directed at the troops from Sgt. Hartman is both timidly amusing and brusquely alarming. It is the first 45 minutes of Full Metal Jacket which projects a mirage of greatness, with the whole time spent depicting the metamorphosis of young men turned born-again killing machines. This first act is in complete odds with the latter act; when the troops are placed in the combat zone. The film suddenly becomes desperately obnoxious, revolving around grown men making puerile jokes at each other and running around Vietnam aimlessly, with no conscience. I personally believe that the narrative should have remained in the barracks for the duration, simply presenting the viewer with the development of the soldiers, instead of also incorporating their war experiences.It is hard to pinpoint the exact problems with Full Metal Jacket, but I think, for the most part, it comes down to its inconsistencies. For one, very little actually occurs throughout the runtime and there is an icy lack of humanity in many of the scenes, but not in the comprehendible, Kubrickian way. Its ideologies and pathos are concealed by a desire to litter so many scenes with narcissistic humour, and so the audience looses its respect for the characters. On the other hand, the performances are, with all reason, up to scratch; particularly those performances from R. Lee Ermey as the inescapable drill-instructor and Vincent D'Onofrio's role as his pitiful victim. Beyond those two performances lies little else on the acting front, with most of the other performers' roles being compromised of heroic despondency and lashings of misunderstood cynicism. Most of all, the message of the film is entirely jumbled and to such an extent that it is in fact difficult to decipher the underlying crux of the ordeal. One thing is for certain that Kubrick perfectly demonstrates how much of a transformation regular men go through before entering war. Such is perhaps the only way man could cope with such a deathly periphery of mouldering principles.This is very much a work of undermined greatness, a meagre example of something which could have been great, but eventually became a rambling mishap, fuelled by ill-defined notions of grandeur. Throughout the '80s there was a string of hefty and effusive Vietnam pictures, some were good and some were bad. The ironic, tight-fisted Full Metal Jacket lay in the midst of it all and many acknowledged that it contained a concept which could have been so much more.

Vampires and Ghosts of Mars were both very disappointing. When I first saw Escape from LA, I was disappointed in much the same way; but after repeated viewing it began to grow on me in a way the others never have.But let's start with the positives The openly satirical episodes (e.g., the 'surgeon general' sequence) may at first appear just too obvious, until one realizes that much of their humor relies on Russell's dead-pan response to them. He knows the surgeon general is a loony, but he doesn't have the time to be amused, and he can't afford to be afraid. Once we get this, a lot of the comedy develops a Swiftian pointedness - even Russell's Snake Pliskin is a bit of a parody, but even if he knows (and he does) he has a job to do and can't stop for self-reflection. So the reality of post-apocalyptic LA, however absurd, must be taken at face-value, if Pliskin is to do his job and survive.Once that is accepted, than we can also recognize that we have a host of really charismatic actors here, who all make their rather disreputable characters not only believable (given the situation), but even almost likable.And certainly, the action sequences, which are clearly intended to be slightly less than credible (what, you thought the surfing sequence was to be taken seriously? i think not), are so over the top as to not only exciting but amusing.Very well; now we need to address what does not work in this film, because the same problems show up in the later Carpenter films as well.The most important problem has to do with narrative construction. Prior to EFLA, Carpenter's strongest ability was to develop a story in such a manner as the audience was left with the sense that not an episode could be cut - what didn't actually move the story still further enhanced the theme. But there are episodes in this film that don't actually seem to be doing anything, even when they are amusing in and of themselves; the 'surgeon general' sequence is a case in point. Once I got the humor of this episode, I then had to find a place for it in the story as a whole, and discovered that I couldn't. Take this scene out, and not a thing about the rest of the movie is altered.Most of what I am referring to here is not on as large a scale as the 'surgeon general' episode; but there are just too many useless bits and pieces cluttering up this movie.Which brings me to a larger issue. When this sort of thing happens, and a film begins to feel over-long because of extraneous material, it means only one thing - self-indulgence. It means the director has lost the ability to view the material in an objectively critical manner. If an idea occurs and the resources are available, it goes down on film and gets shipped to theaters.While a couple directors have actually turned this temptation into a virtue - even a life's work, as with John Waters - self-indulgence is really a director's vice, and the cause of a loss of creativity and of the ability to communicate with one's audience - Think Costner and Waterworld, or Spielberg and 1941; think Cimino and Heaven's Gate. Audiences don't want to see every idea a director has; we only want to see 'just enough' - possibly even less.One more really big problem with this film, that darkens even further carpenter's later work Although the politics of this film are openly libertarian, which has both positive and negative statements to make about contemporary America , what's disturbing is the development of a real paranoia coupled with a profound pessimism. Mixing paranoia and pessimism is like slugging a fifth of gin to wash down a jar full of sedatives - a real downer. And I freely admit that I am alternately paranoid and pessimistic - but it's the alternation of these attitudes that keeps me cheerful. With Carpenter's later films, I'm afraid they come bound together. If the universe is really as bad as we see it in Vampires and Ghosts of Mars - quick, gimme the sedatives and gin, let's get it over with.Well, if it weren't for Buscema and Russell, EFLA would be just as dark.

The story is witty, intelligent, dramatic but also slightly comedic at times, the acting realistic &#150; great performances from all&#133; but what truly sets this film apart is the cinematic experience that you get when you watch it, as it is completely fresh and nothing like I've seen before. Ten out of ten for this superb thriller noir.

I think it is because Lang used such long takes to watch the children playing (from a rather obtuse angle too); then the mother tells them not to sing the horrifying song they were singing (similar to our version of London Bridges or Engine Engine Number Nine. Children mirror what they see and hear; but the only reason the children's song was so atrocious was because the Child Murderer was afoot. Then Lang uses that long take to show the woman readying her table for her child&#151;who will never come home; it is a drastic and dramatic scene and I find the horror of it magnified because we do not see Peter Lorre choking the girl, or stabbing her&#151;or doing whatever. We figured what would happen and in implication the suspense and horror are far greater than any Freddy or Jason slasher flick.I believe, what I find so appealing in this (first) version (Lang's 1931 cut) is that he was directorially satisfied to use long takes and wide shots that showed a world beyond the immediate camera lens&#151;or at least an implied world. That show directorial finesse; something sadly lacking in a lot of contemporary cinema. I was shocked by the use of the obscene language, but it made sense. I found myself wondering, though, if Lang did not use long takes of silence because there were moments where he simply did not have story to tell&#133;ergo, he shows people doing what they do.What I thought most alarming was once the mobs collaborated and cornered and captured Lorre's character, they were actually driven by the rule of law, in a fashion. Though what they did was somewhat vigil-ante, it was at least a forum for a discussion on who has the right to do what to whom. Who does have the right to take a life? Does the state? I must say that Peter Lorre's acting in that scene was nearly as perfect as any actor can get to perfection as humanly possible.It is fitting the justice exacted on the killer life even though Frau Beckmann said justice does not bring their children back (everyone needs to watch their children closer).Of course, we have to understand, this film emerges from pre-Nazi Germany, between the wars. Germany was a demolished state nearly collapsing from the devastating war reparations imposed on it by the League of Nations. The German people were suffering with devastating unemployment rates (for heaven's sake, there wasn't even air conditioning) and people were angry.

W. Murnau's Nosferatu. The expressionists of the 20s and 30s were, as you say Trailblazers. They could make frightening films and I think that Hitchcock did well to study their works, because I believe that he refined what they did into the realm of stereo sound and Technicolor. The pre-noir effect is stark and bleak, and you are right, I think it paints a frightening picture; I will add that it shows us how life may have been in the era.

In fact, it's a throw back to the classical Hollywood era when films like 'Them' (1954) (which was actually featured in Eight Legged Freaks) and the original 'King Kong' from 1933 were made. Unfortunately, this new more modern edition doesn't hold up too well; in fact it wouldn't be a travesty if it was never even made in the first place.The main problem with Eight Legged Freaks is its 'B-movie' approach. Its typical science fiction and horror genre laden content is blended with comedy in a rather distasteful manner and this glares rather badly throughout. The film actually starts out rather well. The stage is set without too much messing around and it's clearly established that the 'kid' is cleverer than his age suggests, we're even introduced to the comic relief character of the film (The radio DJ) rather cleverly and this introduction blends into the initial incident of the toxic waste coming into contact with the towns water supply. In fact, there are a few incidences like this which blend into one another rather nicely; another being the connection between a good action\/chase scene and the phone lines cutting out so the beginning is done well. Unfortunately, the acting is pretty shocking all round through out the film and the dialogue is constantly ruined as a result. Another odd thing about this film is the fact that although I'm slightly arachnophobic, I found the smaller, real spiders scarier to watch than the bigger, more fake ones. Any one else who suffers from the fear need not worry to be honest, as you really do get used to them after a while, especially by the time the mall scenes arrive and they're swarming all over the place.There are a lot of annoying flaws in this film, one of which is the fight between a house cat and a giant spider which occurs behind a recently plastered wall. We actually see imprints of the cat and spiders 'expressions' from the outside and this immediately extinguishes any suspense or fear we're feeling as a result of the eerie build up prior to this fight. This also counter acts something that happens later on in the film as a dog is faced with a similar situation\/fight and is killed without any fuss at all so it makes you think that the cat fight would never had happened like it did. The fact that this spider remains in the guy's house for, what we assume to be, the duration of the film yet the character living there remains unharmed by it. Are we to believe it stayed there in the house within the walls the whole time? Even during the night when the guy's sleeping? Apparently it did.Another incident is when the genius kid is dumb enough to venture deep into a mine entrance early on in the film. He knows something's 'up' and the giant webs and discovery of a large spider leg should be enough evidence to deter him from venturing into the entrance, but he goes in anyway. Another occurrence is the fact that a character is willing to go out onto the roof of a building yet when we're all finally out there, he exclaims that he's afraid of heights. Did the writer(s) realise this? Did they even KNOW their characters and what they would\/ would not do? Evidently not; take a lesson from Tarantino(!) By the finishing act of the film, you can't help but feel that you've seen it all before anyway. The final fight takes place in a shopping mall which is a homage to 'Dawn of the Dead' (1978) I'm sure, not only this but hints of 'Deep Rising' (1998) occur. If you've seen it, replace a motorbike with a jet ski, fill in a couple of other blanks and I'm sure you'll get the picture.All in all, it's an enjoyable film but I can't help but think the whole 'B-movie' thing is just an excuse to paper over the cracks which are there.

He is more than just a hero. He is a legend. A defender of the human spirit, what makes him unique is he's an alien brought up with human values. And in 1978 the Man of Steel was humanised and made flesh, courtesy of the impeccable casting of the late Christopher Reeve.Richard Donner directed the very first epic superhero film for the big screen, and he does magnificently. Before the Superman series was done in with silliness (not counting Superman II), Donner brought an epic flourish to the story of Superman by incorporating many different elements. Beginning as a Christ-like birth of the Son of Man, to the rites of passage as a young Clark Kent grows up in Smallville, to his eventual transformation into Superman.The fact that Superman works as well as it does is down to Donner's firm hand on the reins, and Reeve's marvellous performance. At the time of the film's production, Christopher Reeve was a virtual unknown. But he was born to play Superman. Not only does he resemble the character right down to the smallest detail, he brings a down to earth, human essence to the character that makes him intensely likable and a hero that you can root for.As for his interpretation of Clark Kent, this is where we see the flip-side to his personality. The bumbling, shy but affable news reporter that falls for his co-worker at the Daily Planet, Lois Lane (Margot Kidder). Theirs is one of the most unusual love triangles ever seen.Lois only has eyes for Superman, but can't see him behind Clark's thick glasses. She is tough and forthright with Clark, but goes weak at the knees at the sight of Superman. It's interesting to watch Clark compete with himself, and whether or not Lois will one day put the two and two together.There are quite a few conflicting styles at work. The opening scenes that show the destruction of the planet Krypton are sombre and deadly serious. Marlon Brando was paid an astonishing 4 million dollars for his 15 minutes of screen time. Although Jor-El is integral to the plot, it has to be said Brando's performance was rather lacklustre. He put virtually no enthusiasm into it, and although he gets some great lines of dialogue, he is sadly subdued compared to Reeve's warmth and authority, and Gene Hackman's slightly buffoonish but always menacing Lex Luthor.The comedy element is usually prevalent in Hackman's scenes. Although he is Superman's arch-enemy, there's a surprising lightness to Luthor's scenes. Hackman plays it for laughs but not strictly for laughs. His obsession with destroying Superman is always there, and when he exposes his weakness for Kryptonite, you can see the truly evil and twisted madman he really is.Superman's exploits are exhilarating to watch. When you see Reeve in costume for the first time, you feel very good about yourself. Superman's flying scenes are still pretty good, except for an occasional jerkiness, and whether he's saving Lois from falling off the top of a skyscraper or rescuing a cat from a tree, you enjoy following Superman on his crusade. With John Williams' sweeping musical score, you can't help but be carried along.Everything locks into place and the narrative is so simple to follow. Some of Superman's slogans and limitless good cheer seem hokey today, but it's a reflection of the changing attitudes of our time. Maybe we have become too cynical for our own good, and it's really quite nice to have faith in a symbol who actually believes in his own words. And what's wrong with that?Some of the set designs are breathtaking, especially the planet Krypton that seems an extraordinary glacial landscape, which includes the Fortress of Solitude, as well as the excellent cinematography of the Midwestern plains right up to the hustle and bustle of the city of Metropolis.The ending has always seemed unusual with Superman turning back the rotation of the planet Earth to change Lois' destiny. I don't see how that's possible personally, but if you really are willing to believe a man can fly, why not this?Superman really set the benchmark for superhero films to follow. Others like Batman, Spider-Man 2 and X-Men all have their collective strengths and are excellent in their own right, but Superman still sustains a sense of majesty, awe and most importantly, a tangible feeling of actual fun and enjoyment. Something that the empty-headed superhero flicks of today like The Fantastic Four could never hope to have.One of the true epics of our time that I hope never loses its power.
