When I watched American Pie for the first time I didn't expect much at all... from what I'd heard it was a pretty dumb gross-out comedy that was every 15 year-old boy's favourite film but was highly over-rated. I was right in some ways.... some of the humour is a bit silly and predictable, and there is no doubt it was over-rated - this film is no classic. However, I found it surprisingly enjoyable. Most of the humour was actually really funny, and I found myself laughing a fair bit while watching the film (that hasn't happened since Team America ;) ). The film does get a bit sappy towards the end when it tries to push a few predictable messages about love, but it still carries through to the end well on the strength of the characters. Jim is lovable and sad at the same time, his Dad draws laughs every time he appears on screen, Stifler, Finch, Sherman and of course Michelle are great characters as well. However I found Oz and Kevin, and their respective girlfriends, rather annoying. American Pie is by no means a great movie, but I feel that it did well for what it was trying to achieve. I recommend that you give it a try some time, no matter what you've heard, its actually a decent film.

It was this platformer involving two plumbers rescuing a princess from an army of monstrous turtles (the Koopa Troopas) that single-handedly saved the video game market in 1985. The game proved popular enough to spawn multiple sequels and even a cartoon TV series (which, admittingly, is pretty dated and formulaic, but it did do a respectable job recreating the feel of the series). Given the successful reputation of SUPER MARIO BROS. as a game series, it doesn't seem surprising that a theatrical feature would be attempted. That film version premiered in the summer of 1993, and I was among those who were eager to see it.Unfortunately, the movie turned out to be a major box office disaster and was trashed in almost every newspaper. As a matter of fact, it started the whole videogames don't make good movies craze. I hope that this argument can be proved wrong, but SUPER MARIO BROS. probably will not be a likely candidate to challenge this accusation.This movie gets so many things wrong it's almost a miracle that I can write anything nice about it. With the exception of the characters' names and a few throwaway references, SUPER MARIO BROS., the movie has absolutely nothing in common with the video game series it's based on. The production completely eschews the lighthearted, colorful atmosphere of the Mushroom Kingdom and instead slaps on a dark, fungus-covered metropolis inhabited by dinosaurs evolved (yes, I said EVOLVED) into human beings. (One figures the scriptwriters mixed up SUPER MARIO WORLD--the only game in the series to set in a dinosaur-populated environment--as the ideal atmosphere for the MARIO franchise in general.) Instead of power-up mushrooms, fireflowers, and goombas, we get a human cast of villains acting (and looking) bizarre (even the chief villain, King Koopa is disturbingly portrayed as a human), raptors, exploding flameguns, and some totally ridiculous concept called de-evolution. The nasty goombas are transformed from puny mushroom baddies into hulking lizards, and Yoshi, the beloved dinosaur sidekick of Mario, becomes a cuddly but woefully fake-looking baby T-Rex (and get this--he's Koopa's pet!). The whole atmosphere of this Dinohatten is too weird, chaotic, and cold to be engaging.This may sound bad enough, but the movie's biggest mistake is its failure to provide anything in the way of a coherent (or compelling) narrative. The plot is a jumbled mishmash about meteorites, alternate universes, and fungus that spends too much time indulging in its own stupidity rather than offering some intelligence. The movie's action sequences should provide spark and energy, but here they come across as strangely pointless and uninvolving. Despite the clamor occurring in the scenes, the viewer feels a strange sense of detachment to the whole thing. This makes the movie as a whole a major chore to sit through, as if there aren't any duller moments to bore viewers to death (such as a slow, inactive sequence where Mario and Luigi escape from a goomba-infested elevator). Matters are not helped by the ridiculously cheesy special effects, which are so fake that they come across as laughable.Even the aural aspects of the movie are displeasing; the soundtrack starts out promisingly with an electronic-sounding ditty of the classic MARIO BROS. theme, but aside from that, we got a fully-orchestral score (from Alan Silvestri) which is distressingly un-MARIO like. The same is true for the throwaway rock-and-roll songs, which were obviously slapped on for commercial reasons. The overabundance of screaming and overloud sound mixing is tempting enough to make one turn the volume down.Yet as problematic as the final result is, I do have something of a strange attraction to SUPER MARIO BROS. the movie. I admit to being crazy about the film when I was younger, even when all the critics were tearing it to pieces, and to this day I still wonder why I enjoy watching it every now and then. Perhaps because it's such a sorely misguided, warped, unimaginative mess that it ends up being a flick that can be fun to laugh at.To its benefit, however, SUPER MARIO BROS. does support a high-quality cast--which is quite surprising given that this is hardly the kind of movie that demands one. Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo work chemistry as the brothers, even if they are nothing like their video game counterparts, and Samantha Mathis holds her own ground as the pretty Princess Daisy. Dennis Hopper's portrayal of King Koopa, on the other hand, is disappointingly uncharismatic and spends more time chewing the scenery than creating a character worth rooting against; Fiona Shaw is more effective as his dastardly secretary. All seem to take on their jobs with a good-natured attitude and do what they can with the mumbo-jumbo material.But even that isn't enough to qualify a good recommendation for SUPER MARIO BROS. as a movie. It's too unfaithful a recreation for MARIO fans, too noisy even for action-buffs, and too preposterous to reach a smart audience. If there's anything that I can say about this movie, it could be that it is a guilty-pleasure time killer that evokes plenty of laughs. So if you want to sit through a convoluted, incomprehensible action-flick that blatantly disregards its source material, then this is the movie for you. Otherwise, SUPER MARIO BROS. is not an example of great film-making, much less adapting a video game into a movie.

This film has a special place in my heart as one of the saddest films to date. The two leads, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, do a truly magnificent job at portraying the two doomed, young lovers Jack and Rose. James Horner's score is probably one of the best scores I have ever heard. The set pieces are absolutely stunning, the Titanic is re-created with authenticity and beauty (the look of the exterior and interior of the ship is amazing). The finale is one of the best I have seen It's suspenseful and sad. Happy and tragic.The plot focuses on Jack and Rose. Jack being a poor street boy and Rose being a very rich, engaged women. They both happen to be on the doomed voyage that is the Titanic's. As soon as they meet each other love blossoms and they are both drawn closer and closer together. When the ship hits the iceberg a tale of survival and heart-breaking decisions is brought to life.

Yes, I know this isn't based EXACTLY off the game, yes I know the writing isn't the greatest, yes I know this movie bombed...but in all honesty I don't really care. For what it is, I thought this was a nice, zany, and slightly action-packed movie that I found pretty entertaining. It wasn't based exactly off the movie, and I think that's what gives it a good sense of originality. It's for that reason, at least, partly, why I'm sure it didn't sell well. Too many people expected the same color, same saccharine kiddie-fare, pretty much a full-on big screen rendition of the game. What they got was a movie, gritty, dark, and original instead. And that's a main reason I like it as it is.It had the basics down; two plumbers from Brooklyn, Mario and Luigi, going into an alternate universe to save a princess in peril and stop a megalomaniac from wreaking havoc. In the games, as good as they are, it was basically the same situation, not too much difference in terms of delivery. The games had Koopa vying for power and dominance. In the movie, he already has it, and his power usurped everything to the point where his hunger grew well past the point of what he perceived as reality (he wanted to conquer Earth as well). Boasting a slightly all-star cast (how they got Bob Hoskins to do Mario is past me), and, as stated earlier, a grittier and darker look, it seemed as if the movie itself could appeal to both kids and adults alike.I did enjoy how some of the aspects for Mario and Luigi's powers were explained in a bit more realistic terms (I doubt a fat plumber could naturally jump fifteen feet in the air...). The jump boots, the fire-ball launchers, even the wicked bob-bomb, were written in as more artificial, albeit a bit more believable, powers to be at their disposal. The only real drawbacks I saw was that the writing could've been a bit tweaked, as well as some of the direction (it had two directors Mr. Hoskins absolutely hated, so I'm guessing something was amiss). But as it is, I found this movie enjoyable and fun, and I'd definitely watch it again. Obsessive gamers need not apply (you'd hate this movie, I'm sure of it).

I have read other sources and I would find it believable that in real life, people like the characters depicted would constantly be swearing. That aside, I found the movie to be very thought provoking as it basically shows what happens to people when they are desperate. For a little background, this film was originally a play by David Mamet and frankly, I essentially found this movie to be a play that was filmed. Also, this was an all-star cast with Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey and Alec Baldwin among others. For those readers who have not seen the film, the basic premise is that Alec Baldwin plays a hotshot in the company who tells all the workers that if they don't begin to close any new deals soon, they will be out of a job. For the most part, the office workers find the new leads to be worthless. Therefore, they become desperate and will do whatever they can to get ahead even if it means lie, cheat and steal. What impressed me about the film is how it showed that nobody cares how much experience one might have; all that matters is Can one get the results? To show an example of this, Jack Lemmon played Shelley The Machine Levine who was an experienced sales man and had gotten results in the past. However, it did not seem to matter since he did not seem to be getting the same results now. Also, the film showed other typical type of workers that people could relate to such as Al Pacino's Ricky Roma who was the hotshot in the office and felt he was the one to win all the rewards. To me, Ed Harris's character came across to me as someone who was not really a bad person but turned to less than honest means because he was desperate. Kevin Spacey's character (the office manager John Williams) seemed to me like the person trying to keep order in the office and did not have too much sympathy towards anyone. Alec Baldwin's role was very effective as the big shot who wanted to scare everyone. Just about anyone can say they have had an employer at one point or another who acted that way. In conclusion, I might suggest that the viewer might want to watch this film a second time because even though it is not very long, there is a lot that goes on.

I can certainly understand the appeal in this kind of puzzle-movie; it just never appealed to me. To me the main problem with this kind of stories is that usually, more emphasis is put on the clues than on the characters &#150; and so, when the real murderer is finally revealed, I say well, how about that? &#150; I simply don't care.But in every genre there are always some creations that transcend the genre. Witness for the Prosecution stands as a true masterpiece among the Whodunit murder mysteries, one that will be pure ecstasy to fans of the genre, but is also a fantastic creation on any level and in any standard.

It was different because this was the first time that I've seen the film since reading Clive Barker's novel The Hellbound Heart. The novel both enhanced my enjoyment for the film, and exposed some of its flaws. With the book, Barker really allows the reader to get inside the character's head, which ensures that the horror is more shocking. His descriptions are also a lot more macabre than what is shown in the film, and the way that certain things in the book are missed out\/abridged shows some of the wasted opportunities of the story. This isn't really a criticism of the film, but rather of books being turned into movies on the whole. People often say that the book is better than the movie; and in this case it's true! Even so, Hellraiser is an absolute classic horror film, and easily one of the best of the eighties; not to mention all time. The plot simply follows Frank Cotton. Frank is a man in search of unknown pleasures, and in order to achieve that he buys a mysterious music box. This box does give out pleasure; but it's inflicted by a band of demons, known as 'Cenobytes' - and their idea of pleasure differs from Frank's! The story picks up when Frank's brother and his girlfriend, Julia, move into the house where Frank was taken...The main reason Hellraiser stands out among horror films is because of its themes. Barker weaves shades of love, eroticism and, of course, pain and pleasure into his tale of demons and scarred flesh - and this really makes the film. We can care for the characters and what happens to them because of what Barker puts between them, and it's always evident that this film is head and shoulders above the rest of the schlock-horror sub-genre. The special effects, particularly on the screen time surrounding Frank, are simply stunning and show how real effects beat all this CGI rubbish hands down, while also showing that a low budget can be overcome. The film is never gratuitous with its gore or effects either, and everything in this film is there because it has to be. This is what annoys me about non-horror fans - films like this are dismissed by them because they're too gory or stupid - but Hellraiser breaks the mould because it's a truly original story and the way that Barker implements a macabre love story amidst a plethora of shocking horror is extremely skilfully handled, and more than challenges many of the so-called 'A-class' films.A writer directing his own work tends to ensure that it will get proper treatment, and this is mostly true here. Some things have been changed from the book for no apparent reason (mostly with the characters of Larry and Kristy), but the only thing that really annoyed me was the ending. I suppose it's due to the time that it was made, but the ending feels tacked on to me. Barker's ending in the book was perfectly judged - just open enough to hint at more, while closing the story enough so that the reader is satisfied. Here, we have a schlock finale that is entertaining, but pulls away from the closed atmosphere that Barker has spent the film creating. This film differs from most other eighties horror films because of the fact that the actors are a talented bunch. You come to expect bad acting from this sort of film - but Hellraiser has none of it! The entire cast shine, with Clare Higgins making the biggest impression as the evil Julia. This was Clive Barker's directorial debut, and at times, it's clear that this is the case; but Barker makes the best of his locations, and while his camera sometimes feels enclosed; it fuses with the tragic music brilliantly, and all this helps the film to create that fabulous atmosphere so convincingly.Overall, I have pointed out a couple of flaws here; but I really can't bring myself to give this masterpiece any less than full marks. The originality on display throughout Hellraiser is astounding, as is the atmosphere and the performances pulled out of the actors, along with the fact that this film has entertained me many times and is still as good today as the first time I saw it.

When I watched First Daughter, I clearly recognized the voice of a narrator at the beginning of the film. It was the story of the president's daughter, a living person who experienced real situations; but the narration made it look like a fairy tale. The last shot of the movie contained a closing monologue about princesses and princes, and then lots of fireworks in the sky.This is a part of how Whitaker senses film-making as a director. He's an excellent actor but as a director he's got to take another point of view; and he chooses happiness, optimism if you prefer. He draws the different shades of the film, so you can suffer alongside the characters, because not everything is color pink, you know? But somehow you anticipate smiles and laughs; Whitaker makes sure we realize that.His camera has an intense light all the time; darkness only comes with melancholy and shyness; forbidden love. Not with sadness he lets us see the tears clearly; tears of sorrow in the toughest moments, tears of joy in the cheerful ones. He follows Birdie Pruitt (Sandra Bullock) in her development of a new life. Former prom queen, popular hateful cheerleader&#133;She married the school's sweetheart who then abandoned her and their daughter Bernice (Mae Whitman).Birdie is now staying at her mother Ramona's (Gena Rowlands) place, in Smithville Texas. The film was shot there in the exact location, and Bullock walks her precious legs trough the town trying to get a job, maybe establish a relationship, or do things for her daughter and nephew Travis; just to discover she has never been able to do any of this, and that she's got to learn.When she goes to an employment agency, the secretary starts jumping as if she was a celebrity (in her town she was, probably), and asks her Did you come to see Dot?. Yes, Birdie answers without much understanding. The secretary tells her to wait and after some hours she meets Dot, who says The same old Birdie. After this, Birdie responds Same old Dot, without knowing who the person is. Dot learns this and makes Birdie see how bad she was treated by her during high school.Then she encounters Justin Matisse (Harry Connick Jr.), a hard-working man who her mother likes for her; enough to arrange meetings, dinner and unexpected dates. Some walks they take reveal how stuck Birdie is with life. When they are talking, Justin makes a move You know you gave me my first real kiss, don't you?. Discussing love issues, Birdie concludes Well, I know you have a crush on me&#133; Justin stays still A crush? We're not in high school any more.All of that is treated in Steven Rogers' first screenplay, including one specific scene that shows a committed combination that leads to ultimate happiness. Bernice is angry, so Birdie, Ramona, Travis and a friend, sing a song to her, and in a minute they are all dancing in the bed. During the dance and the song Whitaker shows each of the characters' faces&#133;They're all smiling; and it is so charming it is contagious. Birdie works out the problems singing at that point, afterwards, she tries hard to be a mother and a daughter in her chats with Bernice and Ramona, composed by Rogers' moving words technique.The chats with Ramona are more intense, as is the acting confrontation between Rowlands and Bullock. Rowlands delivers, believe it or not, an Oscar-caliber performance with her overjoyed and life lover grandmother. The way she says things make the viewer believe she's got the wisdom. Bullock is one of the actresses I admire the most and this movie shows an emerging phase of her career, totally natural.

So when I borrowed this film on video (it still hasn't been released on DVD in Australia shamefully), I didn't know what to expect, as I thought it was going to be almost impossible to put Orwell's masterpiece on screen without messing anything up. However, this is a exactly what the director achieved he made a film which is not only a perfect film version of the book, but also a classic in its own right. John Hurt is perfect as Winston, while Suzanna Hamilton and Richard Burton (in his last ever film) are great too. It is hard to find fault with the film, so it seems strange that it only has an average rating of 6.9 on this website (and generally only gets 3\/5 in film books; Fahrenheit 9\/11 gets 4\/5... what is this world coming too?). This is probably because of the darkness of the film, and some of the more agonizing torture scenes towards the end of the film. However, I thought the rawness of the film, the slightly faded look, and the amazing music score all contributed excellently to the film. Admittedly it is not exactly light watching, and some viewers might find it a bit oppressive, but in my opinion this was all in keeping with the classic book that it was based on.... in fact I would recommend any directors who wish to make an adaptation of a famous novel, to look at this film and see how its done.

The initial atmosphere and setting by Clive Barker has completely vanished, yet the morbid surrounding remains and several sequences are still very creepy and unsettling.

Best aspects in this production are the newly introduced 'cenobites' and the occult Parisian portrait. Giant turn-offs are the weak script, the absence of the typical macabre humor and the lack of references to Barker's initial masterpiece.Although not highly memorable itself, Bloodline stands as the last watchable Hellraiser film.

Having bought the rights to Francis Iles' novel, and despite Hitchcock's insistence on sticking with the original ending, neither preview audiences nor the studio were ready to accept Cary Grant as a murderer. So its present ending was hastily written and shot. It completely subverts all the fine work that's gone before.Joan Fontaine was a brilliant actress and valiantly, passionately, breathlessly tries to make the shockingly amateurish dialogue in the final scene work -- Oh, Johnny! You were going to kill yourself instead of me, like the audience and I have thought for the last 90 minutes! Oh, Johnny! It's as much my fault as it is yours! Oh, Johnny! I was only thinking of myself . . . , etc.Cary Grant does his best with this final abomination of a climax. Lina! Lina! How much can one man bear! When you and the audience thought I was in Paris murdering Beaky I was really in Liverpool! Etc.Huh?In other words, this beautifully produced, directed, acted and written psychological suspense thriller turns out to be about a charming lazy n'er-do-well who's sponged and embezzled his way through life, who marries a beautiful but neurotic aristocrat who, from day one, increasingly assumes the worst about her husband -- convincing herself (and us) that he's killed before and now is about to kill her?Just kidding, the tacked-on final scene says. It was all innocent. You eating popcorn out there in the dark, and Lina, should be ashamed for even THINKING such things! Go home now. It helps, out of self defense, to watch Suspicion with the original ending in mind. Yes, the milk is poisoned. Yes Johnny killed Beaky in Paris.
