[{"date":"2 October 2012","score":"","review":" The narrator, who is played by Norton, is identified in the script as Jack but is left nameless in the film. He suffers from insomnia and is just missing something in his life, but he does not know what that something is. He can't sleep, can't think, basically a zombie. He goes to support groups for clarity on anything at all and it makes him happy. After a woman starts showing up to these support groups, he returns to his sad, insomniac ways. He drives himself so crazy his mind creates Tyler, whom he starts a fight club with. He creates Tyler because that is the thing he is missing. He wants to be the person he created but just is not that person so he creates him in his mind, so only he can see and hear him.Throughout the beginning of the movie, before Tyler is introduced, you see the a flash of a person just standing in random places for a split second. This is when the narrator is at his worst with his insomnia. The flash you see turns out to be Tyler. The narrator is so sleep deprived, he imagines these things that aren't actually there. When the narrator is on the plane and meets Tyler for the first time, it shows both characters' brief cases. They are identical. Also at work, the narrator's boss wears different colored ties on different days, and they are said to determine the day and mood of his boss.There are so many scenes that are so significant in this film. However, each character has a scene that is so important to the entire film. For Marla, who is Tyler's\/ the narrator's lover, her big scene is when she is introduced. She comes into the film with a bad reputation already, saying how she ruined the narrator's life. She appears to be the root of all that is evil in the film. Had she not have gone to the support groups, the narrator would still go to them to be happy and actually get sleep, which would lead to the narrator not having to create Tyler, then start fight club and eventually blow up half the city. She is the base for all that happens in the rest of the film. For the narrator and Tyler, I believe a big scene for them was when they first fight in the parking lot of the bar. It just went on to show how rapidly something like that grows because within the next month it was huge. For the narrator, his scene is after the scene in the bathroom with Tyler, when he is at work. He is talking with his boss and usually when he talks with him, he is polite and obeying, but this time was different. The narrator lashes out on him after his boss questions him about a paper that was on the copier. This is where you can tell the narrator is growing to be more and more like Tyler. He just stopped caring altogether. The big scene for Tyler was when he went over the rules of Fight Club. The first two rules are that you do not talk about Fight Club. Tyler stresses the importance of secrecy for the whole operation and you could tell this is where Tyler knew it was going to be big.By seeing how the narrator creates Tyler, how he goes to support groups, him blowing up his own apartment, starting Fight Club, and eventually starting a cult-like group goes to show just how sad he really is. Even if they don't directly go out and say he is not happy, it shows throughout the movie that he is a sad, lonely, and quite frankly, a straight up crazy person. All of these instances are just a few from the movie, but there are plenty more that show he's insane. Starting a cult-like group does not occur this once for Norton's career. His character in American History X does almost the same thing.As far as knowing the narrator was a little crazy, it was obvious to tell he was maybe just a little. You could say it he is a little strange because he wakes up in different places and does not remember how he got there, or because he goes to support groups just to help him sleep at night. But nothing to the extent of what it showed at the end. He creates this alter ego that in the end almost ends up killing him and succeeds in blowing up buildings and never realizes it was really him until Tyler tells him about it. I don't think anyone saw that coming, but you could definitely tell something a little weird was going on with the narrator.The movie itself I feel would be difficult to create but the director nailed it. The scene where Tyler burns the narrator's hand with a chemical is where you can really see the power Tyler has and you can tell the narrator starts to get a little frightened of him and his intentions. Another is when you find out Tyler was really just in the narrator's head and they recap points in the movie where you thought Tyler was the person doing these things but it turns out it was really the narrator. That scene answered any questions of how they did it. Also throughout the movie it did a really great job at hiding but at the same time hinting Tyler was just a figment of the narrator's imagination. The only thing I would question about the movie is when the narrator meets Tyler in the airport and sees Tyler leave in a car he just stole. I personally do not see the importance of him stealing the car and I don't understand who actually stole the car.

It seems that no matter what, Rocky is always down. Whether it be life in general, or just a boxing match. He is always on the bad side of things and digs himself in hole but no matter what obstacles block his path, he climbs out of the hole and comes out on top. And it doesn't matter that he loses the championship fight, because he still wins the moral victory and is happy with what he achieves. There is no question that Rocky is a warrior and he will fight no matter the odds.The reason why I feel Rocky is always down in the beginning is because it makes the victory so much sweeter. Avildsen uses this idea to keep the audience on the edge of their seat. Right when you think it's all over for Rocky, he comes from out of nowhere and wins. Rocky's victory would definitely not be as great without seeing the struggles he had to go through.A huge scene in the movie, which I thought was the initial turning point of the film, was when Mickey, the gym owner, tells Rocky he is nothing. Rocky goes into the gym locker room, as usual, but when he tries to open his locker, there is someone else's stuff in there. He is then told he is kicked out of the gym because he is going nowhere with his career. He doesn't fight anyone big and is not moving up in the boxing world and Mickey lets him know that. This was rock bottom for Balboa. He could've just gave up boxing all together at this point but that is not what he does. When the world has got him down, he fights back, and that is exactly what Rocky does. He uses Mickey's words as motivation and eventually returns to him, begging to help Rocky train for the title fight against the current champion, Apollo Creed. Without Mickey telling him, Rocky doesn't get the motivation to do great things and does not do as well in the title fight, so this is a big scene in the film.Sports movies are known to have happy endings. The protagonist faces adversity but overcomes it and ends up with the victory. This is true and false in Rocky. He is faced with difficulties and does overcome them but he still comes up short in the end. Even though he works so hard and dedicates all of his time and effort into achieving one goal, defeating Apollo Creed, he still loses. Even though this happens, Rocky still feels he is a winner. He gets his life back together, he earns the respect of the entire boxing world, he still has his girl, Adrian, and he proves that Apollo Creed is not invincible. I would count that as a win in my book. So it just goes to show that even if you lose the main event, it is what you learn from the whole experience that matters.

Rick fell madly in love with a woman named Ilsa. Ilsa broke Ricks' heart which made Rick change. When Rick arrived at Casablanca, he bought a bar and in almost every scene, he was drinking. The way I saw it was he was trying to drink his sorrows away. Rick mainly cared about himself and he said that he does not stick his neck out for anyone and he would not help anyone out if he would get in trouble for doing so. Rick would also not get close to anyone probably for fear of getting hurt again. Rick did not socialize with others unless it was business. When people in the bar would ask to have a drink with him, they were told no because Rick did not drink with anyone. However, that changed when Ilsa arrived and she asked to have a drink with him, he sat down and had a drink with Ilsa and her husband. When Ilsa came to his bar, Rick started breaking all of his rules. Rick stuck his neck out even when there was a great danger of him getting trouble and he was getting close to Ilsa again. The writing of this story shows that one person can change the way someone thinks, feels, and acts. This is a good example of a love story. Two men were madly in love with a women and one man had to let the women go because he thought it would be the right thing to do. At the end of the movie, the man let her go because he wanted her to be happy, even if it was not with him. If I were to write a love story, I would use this movie as an example because it shows that you can love someone and risk your life for them and they are with someone else. Rick was given a very valuable object at the beginning of the movie and that was some letters. The letters were very valuable and Ilsa wanted them. Ilsa wanted the papers for several reasons. First, they meant freedom from the Nazis and from Casablanca because the letters meant they could get enough money to leave to make it to America. Second, they meant mobility because they were worth enough money for Ilsa and her husband to get on the plane to leave Casablanca. Lastly, the meant a new life in America because they were able to get on the plane to leave. In a way, Rick was like the Nazis. The Nazis were very powerful people and Rick was a powerful man. The French police told Rick that Islas' husband, Lazlo, was not allowed to leave Casablanca and whoever helped him escape would be in a lot of trouble. Rick had power because he had the papers that Ilsa and her husband needed to leave Casablanca. The Nazis sent Lazlo to a concentration camp where he was not able to leave and Rick had the power to make Lazlo not leave Casablanca.In the love stories I have seen, there is one person that sacrifices their happiness for the happiness of the person they love. Rick was still in love with Ilsa even though Ilsa was married to Lazlo. Rick could have made Isla and Lazlos' lives miserable by not helping them but, he wanted Ilsa to be happy so Rick helped them. Rick ended up losing his love again and risking everything he had and possibly his life. However, what Rick did for them made them happy.

The simple fact of Armageddon not being spoken much of today justifies that. This being said, if one may question another; have you watched the movie Armageddon, 8 out of 10 certainly would shoot back with the reply Yes.The song I don't want to miss a thing debuted at number one at the billboard top 100. Performed by Aerosmith, this song has been the largest hit the band has ever done. This was also the first time in 28 years that Aerosmith topped the billboard top 100 charts. What more is needed to elaborate the greatness of the movies soundtrack? Simply said, nothing!This critic was whistling this tune when the urge to relive the Armageddon experience sprung. Up until this point Armageddon was out of sight and out of mind but not forgotten. It is certain if this article is being read by this time one can still recall the movie. A selected few may even treat themselves to another viewing. Armageddon The place where the final battle will be fought of good and evil (Ref www.dictionary.com)A certain interpretation of the above context was written into a screenplay by Jonathan Hensleigh and J.JAbrams. Both names well acknowledged in the film industry for their contributions. Collaborating with Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay this screenplay saw its way through to cinemas near you in 1998. Collectively the above names have given you the following titles. JUMANJI, DIE HARD, SUPER 8, LOST, THE ROCK, BAD BOYS, PEARL HARBOR, TOP GUN, CON AIR, PIRATES OF THE Caribbean & REMEMBER THE TITANS.A Michael Bay signature always has been his astute choice of sound tracks and his visual effects. Ranging from Armageddon, PEARL HARBOR & TRANSFORMERS this signature move is evident. Nominated for 4 Oscars at the Academy Awards in 1999 Armageddon stood out in the following categories. Best Sound, Best Music; Original Song, Best Effects; Visual Effects, Best Effects; Sound Effects Editing.The earth has 18 days left. Mankind is challenged with its worst nightmare; total annihilation. 65 million years ago historians and science suggests that a similar catastrophe wiped away the dinosaurs and all living things that roamed the earth. The earth as we know it is in direct course collision of an asteroid the size of Texas and the earth's last line of defense and its only line of defense is Harry Stamper(Bruce Willis) and his oil drillers. NASA has no choice but to send up two teams into space in order to save the earth. The short synopsis makes it sound a sci-fi that would drive away an audience that dislikes the genre. Armageddon is many other things over a base of sci-fi. This is a story of love, self realization and redemption that is enchantingly woven around a situation that personifies human emotions in times of adversity. Starring Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Billy Bob Thornton, Will Patton, Michael Clarke Duncan, Owen Wilson, Steve Buscemi, William Fichtner, Peter Stormare and Liv Tyler Armageddon could not have needed a better cast. The cast begins the journey apart with slight hints of connection between each other. Like two hands fitting perfectly into each other they move closer and knit into each other that each life lost on the rock is felt hard by the viewer. Each sacrifice made on the rock tugs on the viewer a little bit harder and may even force out a tear. Personal favorite of this critic would be the only main female cast member Liv Tyler. The trauma of watching the only family she knew going into space to save a world that she did not understand, the agony of knowing that only one of the men she loves is returning back to her and the joy of knowing that one is at least returning to her. An absolute ball of thread her emotional path is and the then 20 year old actress delivered without holding back. Bruce Willis as always does not disappoint the audience. A hint more of Owen Wilson could have been slightly more welcome to promote more comic relief. The lack of Wilson is filled in by Duncan and Buscemi who nails the deal.Opening on the 21st B day of Liv Tyler Armageddon is one of the greatest stories told by Michael Bay. Mixed reviews do fly in the vast ethos of critics which is obvious and is the norm. However the greatness and the simplicity of this story will never be forgotten.

Some kids may think this a kids' film because it involves cats and is animated. No, that's Felix the Cat. Fritz the Cat is an animated film reserved for adults. In fact, this film is the first animated film to ever receive an X rating. By today's standards, this film would definitely receive an R rating. But this film was released in the 1970s, and this is before the MPAA introduced the NC-17 rating. Despite this film being an X-rated film, Fritz the Cat is not a porn. However, this film has a lot of sex scenes, violence and drugs.Fritz the Cat is based on the R. Crumb comics of the same name. Bakshi spent many days mimicking Crumb's style and their drawing style is quite similar. Bakshi made the characters animated, with the background being water colored photographs. What I could infer from this is that Bakshi wasn't intending this animated film to be cartoony, but rather go for a more realistic approach.The voice acting is also good. Rather than recording the dialogue in a studio, Bakshi recorded the dialogue on the street; making the voices of the characters sound more natural. In fact, Bakshi voices one of the pigs and does a terrific job at it. Bakshi also went to a bar in Harlem and interviewed African Americans and used their responses as the dialogue of the crows. And the voice of Fritz is surprisingly Skip Hinnant from the Electric Company. This means that Skip Hinnant is doing the voice for a children's show AND an animated film for adults!The film doesn't really have much of a story, it just revolves around the main character Fritz. A bunch of different events occur and Fritz experiences a bunch of them in order to find a cause for himself. This film is pretty much a political satire that pokes fun of the 60s culture; where Fritz explores the hippie movement, race relations and the free love movement.There are things I like about this film but also things I dislike about this film.I really like how Fritz seems like he's an intellectual but is also very stupid at the same time. Fritz seems to be interested in sophisticated subjects such as existentialism; but starts complaining about how his friends prefer studying over living life to the fullest. I also love the scene featuring the two pig cops. This by far is my favorite scene in the film. When the pigs hear a lot of noise in the apartment, they try and stop Fritz's shenanigans. The pigs constantly quarrel with each other and eventually catch Fritz; but end up in a synagogue. They get distracted by a bunch of rabbis dancing after being informed about weapons being deployed to the US from Israel. I also love the character Duke. Duke is a crow who represents an African American. Most of the characters in the film are jerks, but Duke is the only one who has a bit of sanity. Duke serves as Fritz's guardian; saving his life and protecting him after he starts a riot. Unfortunately, Duke gets killed during the riot. It's a pretty dramatic scene, but the death scene of Duke and his final heartbeats coordinate perfectly with pool balls bouncing into their pockets. This summarizes Duke's debut in the film, where we first see him playing billiards in a Harlem bar.There are also things I dislike about the film. There are a bunch of violent scenes in the film. Some scenes can be too violent, such as the scene where Blue, the heroin-addicted Nazi rabbit beats his cow girlfriend Harriet. There are also a bunch of filler scenes that serve as vignettes and don't pertain to the story of the film. The most obvious example is after Fritz's fussing in his dorm, where we cut to an establishing shot of Harlem being zoomed in, with a crow snapping his finger and Bo Diddley being played in the background. I also dislike how some of the characters are introduced during the strangest times. Winston Schwarz, Fritz's girlfriend who takes him to San Francisco, wasn't introduced, but just shows up unexpectedly. At the start of the picture, when Fritz has lured three girls into a bathtub, we hear Fritz mention the name Winston, even though there is little similarity in voice, personality or even appearance to tie the two Winstons together. To make matters worse, the bathtub Winston reappears at the end of the film, when the orgy is replayed in a hospital bed.Crumb strongly hated the film, thinking Skip Hinnant was the wrong voice for Fritz. Crumb also found the film to be racy, but the Crumb comics were originally racy. This film inspired animators to draw influence from Fritz the Cat to create adult cartoon sitcoms, such as The Simpsons, Family Guy and South Park. The film was so popular it spawned a sequel; but without Bakshi's involvement.

As expected, Mr. Deeds isn't a tiresome retread of old material but a tiresome retread through the odds and ends of Sandler's buffoonish schtick, further cementing that despite tackling a wide range of roles, he has yet to adopt a screen presence that he will choose to make tolerable on his audiences.This sits comfortably aside Happy Gilmore, a film I found funny at first, but ultimately, mean-spirited, obnoxious, and overall incredibly unrewarding. But if we're looking at this film as a character study, then this is probably one of the better Sandler characters. Throughout the first few scenes I thought he'd be one of the best, but as soon as Sandler threw punches occupied by horribly unrealistic sound effects that seemed to interrupt the flow of wind and air my optimism deteriorated.At first glance, the premise mildly passable; Preston Blake (Harve Presnell) is a great American businessman running dozens of television and radio stations across the county and has accumulated an inane amount of money throughout his lifetime. After an attempt to climb a mountain results in him freezing to death, those who run portions of Blake's company find that he left all his savings to his nephew, Longfellow Deeds (Sandler). Just call him Deeds. Deeds comes from a humble town there everyone is polite, understanding, naive, and welcoming to all walks of life. In other words, the world we should live in but do not. When two representatives of Blake's company come to visit Deeds to inform him that his uncle left him $40 billion, they find he is employed at a busy pizzeria and that his biggest ambition is to write greeting cards for Hallmark. Upon informing him of his earnings, Deeds seems shockingly lax and uninterested and when he is taken to his uncle's luxurious apartment it would seem that he has seen hundreds of the same.Overtime, as Deeds begins to somewhat enjoy his fortune, helping others, and making new friends, he becomes acquainted with Winona Ryder's character after she is mugged out in the cold streets. She tells Deeds she is Pam Dawson, a school nurse from Winchestertonfieldville, Iowa, and the two begin to go out. The one thing she neglects to tell him is that her name is actually Babe Bennett, and she works for a TMZ-like station and tries to dig up dirt on Deeds by carrying around a hidden camera and microphone so that she can return the footage to her boss to rework it into something slanderous. Until she realizes what she is doing is wrong and begins to have feelings for the man.Thankfully, the film spares us the ridiculous man's money goes to his head cliché but instead, gives us enough unnecessary sight gags to fill two films. Consider a scene where Deeds reveals to his butler that when he was younger his right foot became so frostbitten that it lost all remote feeling and turned charcoal-black. We then get an outrageous sequence of the man jumping on, stepping on, and stabbing Deeds' foot in hopes to strike some form of clear emotion.And consider another sequence where Deeds is in the right place at the right time and attempts to save a woman from her burning apartment building, but first must rescue her seven cats. He proceeds to throw them outside of the window so they can land on what appears to be a trampoline held by firefighters and proceed to bounce into the next comedic setup. The whole scene is witless and provided me with some of the most wincing and cringing I've done this year to a film that was a comedy. Consistent readers know I do not tolerate animal abuse in films, especially, when it is done for no good reason. To try and get laughs out of it is sickening.Mr. Deeds could've been a fun, lightweight comedy if it weren't for its tonal inconsistency, its barrage of unnecessary sequences, shallow characters, and cheap plot pitfalls.Starring Adam Sandler, Winona Ryder, Kathy Bates, Peter Dante, Allen Covert, Rob Schneider, J.B.

Smoove, and Harve Presnell. Directed by Steven Brill. ","genre":"Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"2 October 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" It is bizarre for me to fathom the idea that Adam Sandler chose the leading role in a remake of a Frank Capra film from 1936 with Gary Cooper as the leading man. As expected, Mr. Deeds isn't a tiresome retread of old material but a tiresome retread through the odds and ends of Sandler's buffoonish schtick, further cementing that despite tackling a wide range of roles, he has yet to adopt a screen presence that he will choose to make tolerable on his audiences.This sits comfortably aside Happy Gilmore, a film I found funny at first, but ultimately, mean-spirited, obnoxious, and overall incredibly unrewarding. But if we're looking at this film as a character study, then this is probably one of the better Sandler characters. Throughout the first few scenes I thought he'd be one of the best, but as soon as Sandler threw punches occupied by horribly unrealistic sound effects that seemed to interrupt the flow of wind and air my optimism deteriorated.At first glance, the premise mildly passable; Preston Blake (Harve Presnell) is a great American businessman running dozens of television and radio stations across the county and has accumulated an inane amount of money throughout his lifetime. After an attempt to climb a mountain results in him freezing to death, those who run portions of Blake's company find that he left all his savings to his nephew, Longfellow Deeds (Sandler). Just call him Deeds. Deeds comes from a humble town there everyone is polite, understanding, naive, and welcoming to all walks of life. In other words, the world we should live in but do not. When two representatives of Blake's company come to visit Deeds to inform him that his uncle left him $40 billion, they find he is employed at a busy pizzeria and that his biggest ambition is to write greeting cards for Hallmark. Upon informing him of his earnings, Deeds seems shockingly lax and uninterested and when he is taken to his uncle's luxurious apartment it would seem that he has seen hundreds of the same.Overtime, as Deeds begins to somewhat enjoy his fortune, helping others, and making new friends, he becomes acquainted with Winona Ryder's character after she is mugged out in the cold streets. She tells Deeds she is Pam Dawson, a school nurse from Winchestertonfieldville, Iowa, and the two begin to go out. The one thing she neglects to tell him is that her name is actually Babe Bennett, and she works for a TMZ-like station and tries to dig up dirt on Deeds by carrying around a hidden camera and microphone so that she can return the footage to her boss to rework it into something slanderous. Until she realizes what she is doing is wrong and begins to have feelings for the man.Thankfully, the film spares us the ridiculous man's money goes to his head cliché but instead, gives us enough unnecessary sight gags to fill two films. Consider a scene where Deeds reveals to his butler that when he was younger his right foot became so frostbitten that it lost all remote feeling and turned charcoal-black. We then get an outrageous sequence of the man jumping on, stepping on, and stabbing Deeds' foot in hopes to strike some form of clear emotion.And consider another sequence where Deeds is in the right place at the right time and attempts to save a woman from her burning apartment building, but first must rescue her seven cats. He proceeds to throw them outside of the window so they can land on what appears to be a trampoline held by firefighters and proceed to bounce into the next comedic setup.

For years, they have had a pledge that if both were single when they turned 28, they would get married.

It may feel like a modern convention to run a franchise into the ground as long as the audience is willing to shell out the cash, but it's been going on for decades. Universal Pictures struck gold with their classic series of movie monsters and, as a result, they were sure to release as many films as audiences would pay to see. THE GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN was the fourth film from Universal with their famous shambling abomination. It was at this point that the series was starting to lose a bit of steam. I suppose there is only so much you can do with a creature like Frankenstein's monster without retreading the same ground. The movie opens with the inhabitants of the village of Frankenstein demanding justice. They believe they've lived under the curse of Frankenstein long enough and a rash decision is made to burn Frankenstein's castle to the ground. In the process, the mob makes the unfortunate mistake of freeing Frankenstein's monster from the sulfur pit in which he's trapped and unleashing him again on the world. Knowing the village will never let them rest, the eternally loyal Ygor helps the monster escape to the town of Vasaria. In Vasaria, Ygor seeks the aid of Frankenstein's other son, Ludwig. A successful neurosurgeon, Ludwig might be just the help Ygor needs in utilizing the monster's incredible power for his own needs. His goal to transfer his brain into the body of the monster and gain his strength.The problem with the Frankenstein movies is that they all follow the same pattern monster on the loose, angry mob with torches, evil science that is an affront to nature. We all know the drill. The first movies were great but I wish the later movies had either tried to break out of the mold or put the monster to rest. GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN finds yet another relative of the original mad scientist being brought into the mix. He is, of course, a talented scientist in the field of neuroscience, having removed a brain for surgery and replaced it successfully back in the skull. This is too good an opportunity for the devious Ygor, portrayed by Bela Lugosi. Lugosi is the best part of this movie as the evil hunchback. He is conniving and simple-minded, desperate to protect his only friend, the monster. All he wants is to be forever unified with his friend and, if he happens to become immortal and all-powerful in the process, all the better. Lugosi is the only stand out performance in the movie. Cedric Hardwicke is nothing special as the tortured Ludwig, forced into a position where he must resort to extreme measures. He seems to have a good head on his shoulders, but why he would agree to save the monster from dissection (the only means of truly killing it) is beyond me. Even more baffling is the motivation behind the less-then-noble Doctor Bohmer (Lionel Atwell). Ygor offers him power, wealth, and the respect of his field if he agrees to sneak Ygor's brain into the surgery, but why would Bohmer, an intelligent man in his own right, believe the empty promises of an evil man such as Ygor? I don't know. He just does. Roll with it.It's all good though. I'm not worried about some poor character decisions. It all works within the scope of the movie. It's a classic creature feature with all the usual tropes we've come to expect. It doesn't rise to the level as the original, and certainly not as high as BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN. It's still an entertaining film, even if it feels a tad generic at this point. Lugosi is great, and Lon Chaney Jr. stands in well enough since Boris Karloff had left his iconic role at this point. If you're a fan of the classics, you can't go wrong with this fun little time-waster.

THE GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN was the fourth film from Universal with their famous shambling abomination. It was at this point that the series was starting to lose a bit of steam. I suppose there is only so much you can do with a creature like Frankenstein's monster without retreading the same ground. The movie opens with the inhabitants of the village of Frankenstein demanding justice. They believe they've lived under the curse of Frankenstein long enough and a rash decision is made to burn Frankenstein's castle to the ground. In the process, the mob makes the unfortunate mistake of freeing Frankenstein's monster from the sulfur pit in which he's trapped and unleashing him again on the world. Knowing the village will never let them rest, the eternally loyal Ygor helps the monster escape to the town of Vasaria. In Vasaria, Ygor seeks the aid of Frankenstein's other son, Ludwig.

GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN finds yet another relative of the original mad scientist being brought into the mix. He is, of course, a talented scientist in the field of neuroscience, having removed a brain for surgery and replaced it successfully back in the skull. This is too good an opportunity for the devious Ygor, portrayed by Bela Lugosi. Lugosi is the best part of this movie as the evil hunchback. He is conniving and simple-minded, desperate to protect his only friend, the monster. All he wants is to be forever unified with his friend and, if he happens to become immortal and all-powerful in the process, all the better. Lugosi is the only stand out performance in the movie. Cedric Hardwicke is nothing special as the tortured Ludwig, forced into a position where he must resort to extreme measures. He seems to have a good head on his shoulders, but why he would agree to save the monster from dissection (the only means of truly killing it) is beyond me. Even more baffling is the motivation behind the less-then-noble Doctor Bohmer (Lionel Atwell). Ygor offers him power, wealth, and the respect of his field if he agrees to sneak Ygor's brain into the surgery, but why would Bohmer, an intelligent man in his own right, believe the empty promises of an evil man such as Ygor? I don't know. He just does. Roll with it.It's all good though. I'm not worried about some poor character decisions. It all works within the scope of the movie. It's a classic creature feature with all the usual tropes we've come to expect. It doesn't rise to the level as the original, and certainly not as high as BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN. It's still an entertaining film, even if it feels a tad generic at this point. Lugosi is great, and Lon Chaney Jr. stands in well enough since Boris Karloff had left his iconic role at this point. If you're a fan of the classics, you can't go wrong with this fun little time-waster.

This film is a sequel to the 1991 hit movie. This film and the original are comedy classics. Barry Sonnenfeild did a fantastic job at directing both films. Sonnenfeild's two movies are the best interpreting of Charles Addam's dark but lovable characters. But this one is better then the original. The first film was more wacky in the style of the classic 60's TV series and spent a lot of time introducing us to the world of the Adams. But this film is more darker and less wacky(but this film still has a good amount of wacky). I can't imagine any other take of the Addams being better then this one or the first film. The cast is perfect and the story and gags here are great. I love the look of the Addam's mansion, it's a character on to it self. The principal cast, except for the actress playing grand-ma-ma have returned. Great actors Raul Julia and Anjelica Houston are once again perfect as Gomez and Morticia. Julia perfectly captures Gomez's suave and romanticism, as well as Gomez's tendencies to be over dramatic. Houston is absolutely great as the dark and mysterious Morticia. Her calmness works well with Gomez's over dramatics's. I love how in this one she is always shown in shadow with just a little bit of light revealing her eyes, as if a mysterious shade follows her around everywhere she goes. The two films perfectly captures their darkly romance and I like their freaky S&M fetish. When I think of Gomez and Morticia I always think of Julia and Houston. Christopher Lloyd is fantastic as the love-ably gross and off putting Uncle Fester. I love how dim witted Lloyd makes Fester. You forget that's Lloyd is Fester, he so becomes the character. I like the decision of making Fester Gomez's brother, instead of Morticia's uncle like in the original TV series. Christina Ricci is terrific as the brooding, stone face Wensday. Sonnenfeild gave Wensday a much larger role in this one and she almost steals the show. Without even saying anything Christina has a look on her face that's just great. Ricci is really great in playing a slightly sinister, never smiling Wensday Addams . She will always be Wensday Adams and this is one of her best performances. And I always like the name Wensday. Jimmy Workman is the son Pugsly, he dosen't do much here but is a good sidekick to Wensday. Carel Struycken has a good look as Lurch, the Frankenstein like butler. Carol Kane takes over the role of grandmother & witch grand ma ma and she does a good job. And I love Thing, the living severed hand with a mind of his own, who always has great moments. The plot evolves around a new baby boy, born with a mustache and looking like Gomez named Pubert coming to the family. Which brings in a nanny named Debbie Jellinsky played by Joan Cusack. The major plot is that the new nanny, Debbie is really a serial killer called The black widow who's pattern is that she marries wealthy men for money and then kills them and she's planning to do the same with Uncle Fester. But things don't go exactly as she plans. This plot works great in the story, because it's really funny seeing Debbie seducing Fester but he's so dim- witted it takes a while for him to get it, and once they get married she can't seem to kill this guy and no matter how obvious her murder attempts are he dosen't seem to get the picture. I also like how she uses sex to control Fester. Cusack gives one of her best and most underrated performances here. This is my favorite role of hers. I love the way she plays Debbie, it's the right balance of crazy and humor. I also love her psychotic laugh. The best scene in the film is towards the end when Debbie has the entire family in electric chairs, showing slide shows about her life and explaining her point of view and showing how crazy she really is, it's a fantastic performance by Joan Cusack. She reveals that she killed her parents as a young girl because they got her the wrong Barbie doll and the real reasons she killed her past husbands wasn't for money it was for trivial things like not being home for dinner. I like how calm the family are during this. I like when Pubert gets sick and becomes a happy Rosie check Shirley Tempel looking baby, much to the family's horror. The other major story are the kids. I like how Wensday and Pugsly get jealous of the new baby Pubert so they try to kill him repeatably in deadly games, but of course for the Addams that's just normal sibling rivalry. They are eventually sent to summer camp and this is a great side story as the kids go to a happy, optimistic and sunny camp ran by two perky scouts Gary(the always hilarious Peter MacNicol) & Becky. Mercedes Mcnab is great as Wensday's rival, a snobby rich girl. Wensday gets romantic with a nerdy outcast named Joel, who works good in the story. One of the funniest scenes is when Wensday, Pugsly & Joel are forced to watch a marathon of light hearted family friendly TV from the Brady bunch to The sound of music and the scene where Wensday forces a strain filled smile that scares the other kids. And I love the ending with Wendsay saying to Joel that unlike Debbie she would kill her husband by scaring him to death and when Joel puts flowers on Debbie's grave, Debbie's hand comes up to grab him and as he screams in horror Wensday gives a sinister grin.

The film takes us to a variety of countries as our two leads hunt down the men responsible for selling nuclear warheads to those hell bent on causing pain and disruption to a country they feel is responsible for destroying their families lives.The Peacemaker opens with a brilliant opening sequence where a corrupt Russian General steals nine nuclear war heads from a train transporting them across the country. In an attempt to cover up their actions they set off one of the bombs in the process, killing up to 15,000 people. The cover up however is not successful and Lt Tom Devoe (Clooney) sees straight through the smoke screen, and upon briefing the acting adviser Dr Julia Kelly (Kidman) the two dart off across the World on the trail of the missing warheads, both using very opposite techniques to find their answers. From Vienna to Eastern Europe to New York City, Clooney and Kidman do all they can to prevent one of the biggest disasters to occur in western civilisation.For starters there is nothing particularly original about this film. The premise is a slight variation on something we have seen so many times before. The problem with this is in the writing where included throughout are several clichéd moment that we have seen in many films of the same era. For example we have the typical cursing every time something bad is said or a gun is fired, we have the typical screaming sidekick teamed up with the unfazed hard man (Kidman and Clooney), and as well we have the run 'with only ten seconds to spare' and jump as the bomb explodes in the background, as a matter of fact we have that twice. It is a slight shame really considering the opening sequence is very well done, but the pacing there on in just drags until the next set piece which is then followed again by slow pacing before the next set piece. This can only be a fault in the writing where we are literally given all the stereotypes of this type of film in one two hour block. The best part about the writing is the B story involving a diplomat who has an agenda for his deadly act. The story is dripped in slowly at the beginning and then brought to the forefront for the final act. It is the best part about the story as it is something slightly different than your typical Russian baddie plot; however it isn't particularly the norm that a B story actually completely overtakes the main plot of a film for the final thirty minutes of it. It makes the opening ninety minutes feel a little clunky and shows how weak the main plot actually is.Some of these issues could be down to the direction, which although not entirely bad does seem a little flat. Mimi Leder does manage to get a decent performance from Clooney but Kidman doesn't seem out of her comfort zone. The opening sequence is very well directed, and the music really adds to the drama, but the other action sequences seem pretty lifeless, especially the chase scene through the streets of Vienna. Also something that was heavily noticed whilst watching was the amount of time taken to chase this man throughout New York without the bomb going off when he had put a time limit on the bomb for a much shorter amount of time. Put it this way an entire third act which is about twenty minutes of screen time told us it was only about seven minutes in their world. It was definitely not plausible and there is a way they could have got over this.The film isn't entirely bad but there is enough wrong with it to make it not particularly good. The tired clichés really take over after such a promising start to proceedings. The film could have, and probably should have, been better but the lifeless way in which the story was told, and the dull action sequences, really hindered the possibilities the film could have had. The music was one of the standout points, composed by Hans Zimmer, and from knowing his work in this day and age it is very obviously his work and the soundtrack booms over every tiny piece of action, unfortunately the action fails to live up to the score. I can't particularly say I was disappointed with this film as the opening scene was definitely one I was pleased to have seen, the thing is I could have happily turned it off after the opening twenty minutes and have ended up seeing a much better film.2 \/ 5For more reviews www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"2 October 2012","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Made in 1997, although very much relevant in today's world, The Peacemaker stars George Clooney and Nicole Kidman in this action thriller revolving around potential terrorist attacks in New York.

From Vienna to Eastern Europe to New York City, Clooney and Kidman do all they can to prevent one of the biggest disasters to occur in western civilisation.For starters there is nothing particularly original about this film. The premise is a slight variation on something we have seen so many times before. The problem with this is in the writing where included throughout are several clichéd moment that we have seen in many films of the same era. For example we have the typical cursing every time something bad is said or a gun is fired, we have the typical screaming sidekick teamed up with the unfazed hard man (Kidman and Clooney), and as well we have the run 'with only ten seconds to spare' and jump as the bomb explodes in the background, as a matter of fact we have that twice. It is a slight shame really considering the opening sequence is very well done, but the pacing there on in just drags until the next set piece which is then followed again by slow pacing before the next set piece. This can only be a fault in the writing where we are literally given all the stereotypes of this type of film in one two hour block. The best part about the writing is the B story involving a diplomat who has an agenda for his deadly act. The story is dripped in slowly at the beginning and then brought to the forefront for the final act. It is the best part about the story as it is something slightly different than your typical Russian baddie plot; however it isn't particularly the norm that a B story actually completely overtakes the main plot of a film for the final thirty minutes of it. It makes the opening ninety minutes feel a little clunky and shows how weak the main plot actually is.Some of these issues could be down to the direction, which although not entirely bad does seem a little flat. Mimi Leder does manage to get a decent performance from Clooney but Kidman doesn't seem out of her comfort zone. The opening sequence is very well directed, and the music really adds to the drama, but the other action sequences seem pretty lifeless, especially the chase scene through the streets of Vienna. Also something that was heavily noticed whilst watching was the amount of time taken to chase this man throughout New York without the bomb going off when he had put a time limit on the bomb for a much shorter amount of time. Put it this way an entire third act which is about twenty minutes of screen time told us it was only about seven minutes in their world. It was definitely not plausible and there is a way they could have got over this.The film isn't entirely bad but there is enough wrong with it to make it not particularly good. The tired clichés really take over after such a promising start to proceedings. The film could have, and probably should have, been better but the lifeless way in which the story was told, and the dull action sequences, really hindered the possibilities the film could have had. The music was one of the standout points, composed by Hans Zimmer, and from knowing his work in this day and age it is very obviously his work and the soundtrack booms over every tiny piece of action, unfortunately the action fails to live up to the score. I can't particularly say I was disappointed with this film as the opening scene was definitely one I was pleased to have seen, the thing is I could have happily turned it off after the opening twenty minutes and have ended up seeing a much better film.2 \/ 5For more reviews www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com ","genre":"Action, Thriller"},{"date":"2 October 2012","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Made in 1997, although very much relevant in today's world, The Peacemaker stars George Clooney and Nicole Kidman in this action thriller revolving around potential terrorist attacks in New York.

In the town where the masks are made, they find that cameras are everywhere and it feels sort of like mini-totalitarian state. This film has a lot going for it.

The movie did have a few scenes that I enjoyed, but overall I'd have to say it was a mediocre film with a poor plot and average acting (besides Helen Chandler).

Another thing I found very confusing was Renfield, he was very distracting and somewhat annoying and I found him purposeless in the film. On a positive note Helen Chandler's acting was phenomenal as Mena; she played every aspect of her role to a T. The movie did have a few scenes that I enjoyed, but overall I'd have to say it was a mediocre film with a poor plot and average acting (besides Helen Chandler). The film was not necessarily bad, but it isn't something I would really suggest to anyone who is looking for an interesting all-time classic film.

I anticipated something spooky that would leave with an eerie feeling when quite honestly I feel asleep three times while trying to watch this film and had to continually re-start it. The movie started off good and indeed grabbed my attention, but shortly into the movie I was lost.

The writer did an amazing job with putting parallels into the story. I like how in the beginning of the movie there was a short story about Dorothy and her life and after she was bumped her head and went to Oz, the same story was told but in much more detail. If I were to write a story with parallels this movie would be a great example to look at. Part of the parallel writing included having the main characters show up in Kansas and Oz and the non main characters only showing up in Kansas or Oz. The workers on Dorothy's aunt and uncles' farm in Kansas were also in Oz. The worker that told Dorothy to have a brain was the scarecrow, the worker who told Dorothy to have a heart was the tin man, and the worker who told Dorothy to have courage was the lion. Mrs. Gulch from Kansas was one of the wicked witches and the professor Dorothy met when she was trying to run away was the wizard. The non main characters were mainly in Oz, for example, the munchkins, flying monkeys, and the soldiers the wicked witch had.When Dorothy landed in Oz and was given the shoes I did not think the shoes were going to be a big deal. Turns out, the shoes show Dorothy's' inner struggles and she has to decide if she would be a good witch (make good choices in life) or a bad witch (make bad choices in her life). She has temptations from the bad witch; however, she did not give in. When Dorothy finally woke up in Kansas she was a completely different girl. Before, she took people for granted liker her aunt and uncle and she tried to run away. When she woke up, she showed them respect and love which shows she chose the inner good witch. If she came back and was still disrespectful and took them for granted she would have chosen the inner bad witch.In this movie Dorothy had a mentor that watched her and only helped her when she really needed help. Glenda, the good witch, was Dorothy's mentor and Glenda wanted Dorothy to choose her own paths. When Dorothy was following the yellow brick road and there were three ways to go Glenda did not tell her what way to go, Dorothy had to make the decision. Dorothy needed help the most when she fell asleep due to the poppy flowers so, Glenda helped by making it snow to wake Dorothy up. Glenda only helped Dorothy this time because she fell asleep and would not wake up. Since she was asleep, Dorothy could not go on and follow the path.The wicked witch of the west wanted the shoes her sister, the wicked witch of the east was wearing. By the way the wicked witch of the west was acting, she did not care that her sister was dead because she only cared about getting the shoes. When the shoes appeared on Dorothy's' feet, the witch of the west became very angry and disappeared with intentions of getting the shoes. The wicked witch of the west was watching Dorothy throughout her journey and when Dorothy started to get close to the castle, the wicked witch tried to stop her by putting a poppy field in Dorothy's way to make her sleepy. However Glenda helped Dorothy and Dorothy made it to the castle. Dorothy had to go to the witches' castle and the witch ended up kidnapping her. The witch realized that she could not make Dorothy give in so, the witch gave Dorothy an choice, either give the witch the shoes or Dorothy's dog would be taken. When musicals have a happy ending, the good characters rise and the evil characters fall and in this musical, Dorothy rose because she became a better person who showed respect and the wicked witch of the west ended up dying.

Also, all the characters lacked a bit development; a great surprise was Jude Law's, who was really intriguing, though unfortunately underused.Overall, I thought this was a marvelous movie, technically, but lacked a great amount of emotion and that little thing that sucks you in the plot the script is kind of basic and doesn't show much lyricism.
