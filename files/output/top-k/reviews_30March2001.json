She keeps an in control attitude on through the entire course of this film, and I actually cared about her, and her evil manipulation, because she gives her character good reason for everything she does.

","genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance"},{"date":"30 March 2001","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  The music in the version I saw was restrained and appropriate. Beware!  You may not want to read further if you haven't seen the movie. A stunning movie.  Lao Jin is steady, wise, experienced, not someone you would expect would join 15\/16-year old Xiu Xiu (pronounced Show Show) in a romantic murder-suicide, so it's all the more powerful and moving when he does.  The shots of the serpentine river at dusk, the wide open spaces and Lao Jin on horseback racing along a ridge silhouetted against the ominous evening sky are fabulous.  The male exploitation of Xiu Xiu is heart wrenching.  The actress Lu Lu as Xiu Xiu is beautiful enough to suspend you in awe all by herself.  It's reduced me to clichés I usually avoid. I had some difficulty with making Lao Jin emasculated from a war wound, as if that's the only way we would believe a herdsman would play father figure rather than seducer. It could have been entitled Under the Sun.  The cultural revolution has great aims to change social relationships, but the reality is there's nothing new under the sun. When Xiu Xiu belittles Lao Jin for being someone who only raises horses, he simply responds, They raise me too.  She can't understand how he's willing to spend his whole life in the country.  He responds, Every place is the same. The narration by Xiu Xiu's young male friend from Chengdu seems somewhat strained and unrealistic, since he could only have heard rumors about her fate, and it's a device with little practical effect on the story anyway, added, I suspect, only to try to add resonance. Before she knows it's a bath tub that Lao Jin is constructing, a curious, puzzled Xiu Xiu comments, It's almost long enough for a coffin.  Which is what it becomes, all the more appropriate because of her, and now his, symbolic effort to cleanse her body and purify her soul of the corruption which has invaded it. Lao Jin was slow to understand the cleansing power of water for Xiu Xiu. After the second man to come to the tent has his way with her, she asks Lao Jin if there's any water.  He gives her tea or wild onion drink and she says no, she wants water, so he rides off to the river and returns with water, only to be surprised when, instead of drinking it, she uses it to wash herself.  Bathing is for her a way of trying to restore some of her purity. He's a rustic and cleanliness has never been important to him.  It's one of the things that separate them, an urban girl literally a class above the country laborer.  Yet he's not nearly as slow to understand and feel the degradation the men bring her.  Perhaps the bathing motif is part of the process by which he falls in love with her, simultaneously making her different and mysterious and allowing him to develop empathy.  As he gradually sees and feels how she suffers and tries to cleanse herself, his heart is moved ever more deeply. In her childishness and homesickness Xiu Xiu mocks Lao Jin for his way of life in this vast landscape.  You don't have anything, she tries to taunt him.  Not even a radio or a watch she says.  He shows her his radio but he's not very interested in it.  She talks about being able to get food in Chengdu made with so many ingredients that people wait in line for it. Waiting in line, ironically, is the predicament of Educated Youth like herself who need permits to return there, and the food prepared by Lao Jin she actually seems to like quite well.  The other example of the superiority of cosmopolitan life she mentions is the Chengdu chrysanthemum show. This too is ironic, for surely, no flower show in the city could possibly compare to the beautiful wild flowers surrounding her in the country.  As a, now, 16-year old girl, she's perhaps still too young to see the beauty of nature, but the landscape may be becoming less bleak to her.  When storm clouds in the distance create a glorious rainbow, she says it's as beautiful as the People's Boulevard in Chengdu. The possibility that in time she might have come to love these vast open spaces, like the possibility that she might have used her spirit and her wits to find a way to get back home, is just that, a possibility only, something that adds to our frustration and longing for her, our hope that she'll resist the men who would steal her innocence and her very life, and adds to our anguish that her life is so tragic. This film is a tremendously powerful feminist statement because of the way that what she sees as her only hope of escape is what seals her fate. Once she yields to the men, her reputation is destroyed and she can never go back. Chen juxtaposes a sequence of Lao Jin collecting eggs with the second visitor to the tent brutishly having sex with Xiu Xiu, cutting back and forth.  Both sequences involve a plundering, but they're opposite in tone and feeling.  He's planning to bring back the eggs for her, while she is in the process of giving up her innocence and dignity.  I think Chen wants this context.  She wants us to be thinking of the two acts together, for their differences, that Xiu Xiu doesn't really have to be giving in this way to another's corrupt lust, that with the pure love of Lao Jin something better could have been worked out.  The juxtaposition just makes our anguish all the more heart-wrenching. In the post-film discussion Debbie Gaudet asked why Lao Jin doesn't try to stop the men from taking advantage of Xiu Xiu.  A man said Lao Jin understood that his power was limited.  A woman disagreed, asserting that he could have driven them off with his moral force.  No doubt with his gun as well, but Lao Jin is a philosophical man.  He takes a long view of things, and he could well have felt there would be eventual retribution. Shooting through the cap of one herdsman was about as far as he was prepared to go, at that point.  But as he falls more deeply in love with Xiu Xiu and is more outraged with the way she's treated, he takes increasingly stronger action. When he shoots her, he takes his own life not only as a Byronesque, romantic act but because he knows he would be held responsible for killing her. Another woman said Lao Jin didn't try to stop the men who came to the tent because he respected her right to make her own decisions.  Not exactly. I don't think he regarded her at age 15 or 16 to be quite an adult yet. The first two men, of course, came while he wasn't there.  And Lao Jin had been around.  He comes from a rough world.  He knows what men are like.  He understands nature, and while he's a good man, his morality is not exactly of the drawing-room variety.  Virginity and purity probably mean less to him than to most. The torture Lao Jin once endured during the struggle in Tibet cost him his manhood.  But was he castrated or was his penis cut off?  Other herdsmen making fun of him say they've heard he squats like a woman when he pees. Others describe him as a tea pot without a spout.  And he dares the herdsmen to take him on and try to bite off my balls, so he apparently still has that part of his anatomy.  This could make a difference to how he sees Xiu Xiu and how he feels about her.  If he'd lost his testicles, I imagine he'd suffer a hormonal change and wouldn't feel ordinary sexual desire.  But if he lost his penis, he'd still have the desire without the ability to fulfill it. In a post-discussion discussion a woman who was a sent-down girl in China and survived the experience was asked by Debbie whether most people in China were against the program of sending the educated urban youth into the country.  Her fascinating response was, You have no way to be against. The question was an American, Western, liberal democratic question.  The Chinese, then if not still, could not even think in terms of such a question.  There were no elections, no public opinion polls, no letters to the editor, no way to register dissent of any kind.  That was the policy. There was no choice. China's ban on Xiu Xiu is a good example not only of the narrowness of politicians but of their cowardice and short-sightedness.  This is a movie about universal evil and corruption.  It doesn't come down on the cultural revolution or Communism in particular, and is actually rather gentle in that regard, even understanding and compassionate toward the ideals of the program.  And it certainly leaves a Western audience with more, not less, respect and admiration for China, that it can have produced so fine a work of art.

Perhaps the bathing motif is part of the process by which he falls in love with her, simultaneously making her different and mysterious and allowing him to develop empathy.  As he gradually sees and feels how she suffers and tries to cleanse herself, his heart is moved ever more deeply. In her childishness and homesickness Xiu Xiu mocks Lao Jin for his way of life in this vast landscape.  You don't have anything, she tries to taunt him.  Not even a radio or a watch she says.  He shows her his radio but he's not very interested in it.  She talks about being able to get food in Chengdu made with so many ingredients that people wait in line for it. Waiting in line, ironically, is the predicament of Educated Youth like herself who need permits to return there, and the food prepared by Lao Jin she actually seems to like quite well.  The other example of the superiority of cosmopolitan life she mentions is the Chengdu chrysanthemum show. This too is ironic, for surely, no flower show in the city could possibly compare to the beautiful wild flowers surrounding her in the country.  As a, now, 16-year old girl, she's perhaps still too young to see the beauty of nature, but the landscape may be becoming less bleak to her.  When storm clouds in the distance create a glorious rainbow, she says it's as beautiful as the People's Boulevard in Chengdu. The possibility that in time she might have come to love these vast open spaces, like the possibility that she might have used her spirit and her wits to find a way to get back home, is just that, a possibility only, something that adds to our frustration and longing for her, our hope that she'll resist the men who would steal her innocence and her very life, and adds to our anguish that her life is so tragic. This film is a tremendously powerful feminist statement because of the way that what she sees as her only hope of escape is what seals her fate. Once she yields to the men, her reputation is destroyed and she can never go back. Chen juxtaposes a sequence of Lao Jin collecting eggs with the second visitor to the tent brutishly having sex with Xiu Xiu, cutting back and forth.  Both sequences involve a plundering, but they're opposite in tone and feeling.  He's planning to bring back the eggs for her, while she is in the process of giving up her innocence and dignity.  I think Chen wants this context.  She wants us to be thinking of the two acts together, for their differences, that Xiu Xiu doesn't really have to be giving in this way to another's corrupt lust, that with the pure love of Lao Jin something better could have been worked out.  The juxtaposition just makes our anguish all the more heart-wrenching. In the post-film discussion Debbie Gaudet asked why Lao Jin doesn't try to stop the men from taking advantage of Xiu Xiu.  A man said Lao Jin understood that his power was limited.  A woman disagreed, asserting that he could have driven them off with his moral force.  No doubt with his gun as well, but Lao Jin is a philosophical man.  He takes a long view of things, and he could well have felt there would be eventual retribution. Shooting through the cap of one herdsman was about as far as he was prepared to go, at that point.  But as he falls more deeply in love with Xiu Xiu and is more outraged with the way she's treated, he takes increasingly stronger action. When he shoots her, he takes his own life not only as a Byronesque, romantic act but because he knows he would be held responsible for killing her. Another woman said Lao Jin didn't try to stop the men who came to the tent because he respected her right to make her own decisions.  Not exactly. I don't think he regarded her at age 15 or 16 to be quite an adult yet. The first two men, of course, came while he wasn't there.  And Lao Jin had been around.  He comes from a rough world.  He knows what men are like.  He understands nature, and while he's a good man, his morality is not exactly of the drawing-room variety.  Virginity and purity probably mean less to him than to most. The torture Lao Jin once endured during the struggle in Tibet cost him his manhood.  But was he castrated or was his penis cut off?  Other herdsmen making fun of him say they've heard he squats like a woman when he pees. Others describe him as a tea pot without a spout.  And he dares the herdsmen to take him on and try to bite off my balls, so he apparently still has that part of his anatomy.  This could make a difference to how he sees Xiu Xiu and how he feels about her.  If he'd lost his testicles, I imagine he'd suffer a hormonal change and wouldn't feel ordinary sexual desire.  But if he lost his penis, he'd still have the desire without the ability to fulfill it. In a post-discussion discussion a woman who was a sent-down girl in China and survived the experience was asked by Debbie whether most people in China were against the program of sending the educated urban youth into the country.  Her fascinating response was, You have no way to be against. The question was an American, Western, liberal democratic question.  The Chinese, then if not still, could not even think in terms of such a question.  There were no elections, no public opinion polls, no letters to the editor, no way to register dissent of any kind.  That was the policy. There was no choice. China's ban on Xiu Xiu is a good example not only of the narrowness of politicians but of their cowardice and short-sightedness.  This is a movie about universal evil and corruption.  It doesn't come down on the cultural revolution or Communism in particular, and is actually rather gentle in that regard, even understanding and compassionate toward the ideals of the program.  And it certainly leaves a Western audience with more, not less, respect and admiration for China, that it can have produced so fine a work of art.

You may not want to read further if you haven't seen the movie. A stunning movie.  Lao Jin is steady, wise, experienced, not someone you would expect would join 15\/16-year old Xiu Xiu (pronounced Show Show) in a romantic murder-suicide, so it's all the more powerful and moving when he does.  The shots of the serpentine river at dusk, the wide open spaces and Lao Jin on horseback racing along a ridge silhouetted against the ominous evening sky are fabulous.  The male exploitation of Xiu Xiu is heart wrenching.  The actress Lu Lu as Xiu Xiu is beautiful enough to suspend you in awe all by herself.  It's reduced me to clichés I usually avoid. I had some difficulty with making Lao Jin emasculated from a war wound, as if that's the only way we would believe a herdsman would play father figure rather than seducer. It could have been entitled Under the Sun.  The cultural revolution has great aims to change social relationships, but the reality is there's nothing new under the sun. When Xiu Xiu belittles Lao Jin for being someone who only raises horses, he simply responds, They raise me too.  She can't understand how he's willing to spend his whole life in the country.  He responds, Every place is the same. The narration by Xiu Xiu's young male friend from Chengdu seems somewhat strained and unrealistic, since he could only have heard rumors about her fate, and it's a device with little practical effect on the story anyway, added, I suspect, only to try to add resonance. Before she knows it's a bath tub that Lao Jin is constructing, a curious, puzzled Xiu Xiu comments, It's almost long enough for a coffin.  Which is what it becomes, all the more appropriate because of her, and now his, symbolic effort to cleanse her body and purify her soul of the corruption which has invaded it. Lao Jin was slow to understand the cleansing power of water for Xiu Xiu. After the second man to come to the tent has his way with her, she asks Lao Jin if there's any water.  He gives her tea or wild onion drink and she says no, she wants water, so he rides off to the river and returns with water, only to be surprised when, instead of drinking it, she uses it to wash herself.  Bathing is for her a way of trying to restore some of her purity. He's a rustic and cleanliness has never been important to him.  It's one of the things that separate them, an urban girl literally a class above the country laborer.  Yet he's not nearly as slow to understand and feel the degradation the men bring her.

And with instantly disposable bad guys that are as nasty as possible with out being nasty enough to want to emulate. This isn't automatically a bad thing but it's like comparing Westlife to U2. Alright in a safe, disposable sort of way but the grown ups are doing bigger and better things.As much as Woo would like to think this is a romance, it ain't. You can see him trying to inject emotion and pathos into this story but the script just isn't strong enough and the middle drags forever.

Just when one aspect gets good, something drops it down a peg. Key example Cruise drops from a helicopter down a vertical air-shaft to wipe out the remains of the dread virus. And then spends 10 minutes walking around at Michael Myers pace instead of moving with more appropriate expediency and getting the job done in 2. It's not necessarily a problem with the plot. It features some clever twists and turns and generally keeps moving throughout but Robert Towne can write better dialogue than this. Ving Rhames pops up to keep fans happy and is then totally marginalised. Thandie Newton looks gorgeous but she's a little too wooden for comfort. The same could be said for Tom. Both of them are great actors but they're just spinning their wheels here. Dougray Scott's evil glint of barely controlled mania makes him the ideal foil for Cruise's clean cut hero and is easily the best part of the film. An evil leer is never off his lips but he lapses into panto bad guy just when we need true dispicableness. In short, we've seen all this before and we've seen it better. Hans Zimmers guitar led score is pretty damn pulse quickening though. Even if the occasional lapses into Enya-ism's and flamenco don't quite match the on-screen carnage.But cometh the final act, cometh the action maestro. Doves, slo-mos, wooshing sound effects and all.

Every time Newton walks down a street her derriere swings like a pendulum. A case of style over substance? More like cash over credibility. But does that make a bad film? No not really, just not a great one. It proves beyond doubt that this is a franchise with phenomenal potential, but maybe Cruise should let his ego take a back seat next time.

So what the hell do they mean? Well, beats me. Not too long ago, we were having a philosophical conversation about movies, when the subject came to Star Wars and the quels. (Pre and se.) We were arguing which one was the best. One of my friends said, Well, I gotta admit, the first one is a classic, but the prequel has its moments. I swear a tear came to my eye. I never thought I'd have this kind of conversation with one of my friends.My point here is that Star Wars is a classic even to people who don't know Casablanca from Scooby Doo. It has everything you could possibly want action, romance, midgets, cool creatures, quotable dialogue, midgets in bear suits, a great score and many more midgets. (Seriously, though, I don't mind midgets.) All this in a non-violent, non-racy, perfect-for-your-wee-ones package.For those of you who haven't seen this movie (yes, all 20 of you. I'm watching you.) I'll describe the plot. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is a young man who lives with his uncle and aunt on a desert planet. See. Luke's parents are dead. One day, as Luke is... outside, something crashes and he checks it out. It turns out there were two robots in there, namely C-3P0 and R2-D2. They have a message to give to some guy named Obi-Wan Kenobi (which turns out to be Alec Guiness!) from Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher). Luke goes off to find old Ben, who lives close to his uncle. Old Ben gives Luke a long story about how his father was a Jedi and he will be one too, etc. When they come back, Luke's uncle and aunt are dead and now, he's not safe. So Luke and Ben and the robots head to Nar Shadaa, a hole, basically. There they meet up with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his big, uh, ape-like thing called a Wookie.There's a lot more plot to this movie, and I would pass the limit of 1000 word before I could explain it all. The fact of the matter is, there'S a lot of backstory to this movie. There's probably more backstory to this movie than there is to your LIFE. (Don't feel bad...) I used to be a fanatic. I used to know everything there was to know about Star Wars. And you will notice that I didn't start my review by saying I was blah blah blah in 1977. Why is that? Because, I wasn't at all in 1977. I saw every movie in its special edition form, in 1997. I had seen the movies on TV before, but they never held my attention. Until they were re-released. Just type in Star Wars in a search engine. You'll see that this movie has a rabid following and a detailed history to boot.The acting here is not what's important. It's about on the same level as old adventure films of the 30's and 40's except for a few notable exceptions (Guiness, Ford and a few supporting actors). What makes this movie exceptional is the whole spectacle that unfolds. This is never boring, rarely violent and always a treat to watch. All the creatures, all the characters, all the action scenes, all of this movie is basically perfect. People criticize it as being a kids' movie, as being just stupid mindless action. Well, you guys are right.

So what the hell do they mean? Well, beats me. Not too long ago, we were having a philosophical conversation about movies, when the subject came to Star Wars and the quels. (Pre and se.) We were arguing which one was the best. One of my friends said, Well, I gotta admit, the first one is a classic, but the prequel has its moments. I swear a tear came to my eye. I never thought I'd have this kind of conversation with one of my friends.My point here is that Star Wars is a classic even to people who don't know Casablanca from Scooby Doo. It has everything you could possibly want action, romance, midgets, cool creatures, quotable dialogue, midgets in bear suits, a great score and many more midgets. (Seriously, though, I don't mind midgets.) All this in a non-violent, non-racy, perfect-for-your-wee-ones package.For those of you who haven't seen this movie (yes, all 20 of you. I'm watching you.) I'll describe the plot. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is a young man who lives with his uncle and aunt on a desert planet. See. Luke's parents are dead. One day, as Luke is... outside, something crashes and he checks it out. It turns out there were two robots in there, namely C-3P0 and R2-D2. They have a message to give to some guy named Obi-Wan Kenobi (which turns out to be Alec Guiness!) from Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher). Luke goes off to find old Ben, who lives close to his uncle. Old Ben gives Luke a long story about how his father was a Jedi and he will be one too, etc. When they come back, Luke's uncle and aunt are dead and now, he's not safe. So Luke and Ben and the robots head to Nar Shadaa, a hole, basically. There they meet up with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his big, uh, ape-like thing called a Wookie.There's a lot more plot to this movie, and I would pass the limit of 1000 word before I could explain it all. The fact of the matter is, there'S a lot of backstory to this movie. There's probably more backstory to this movie than there is to your LIFE. (Don't feel bad...) I used to be a fanatic. I used to know everything there was to know about Star Wars. And you will notice that I didn't start my review by saying I was blah blah blah in 1977. Why is that? Because, I wasn't at all in 1977. I saw every movie in its special edition form, in 1997. I had seen the movies on TV before, but they never held my attention. Until they were re-released. Just type in Star Wars in a search engine. You'll see that this movie has a rabid following and a detailed history to boot.The acting here is not what's important. It's about on the same level as old adventure films of the 30's and 40's except for a few notable exceptions (Guiness, Ford and a few supporting actors). What makes this movie exceptional is the whole spectacle that unfolds. This is never boring, rarely violent and always a treat to watch. All the creatures, all the characters, all the action scenes, all of this movie is basically perfect. People criticize it as being a kids' movie, as being just stupid mindless action.

Erin Brockovich, probably the most underrated film of last year, eventually got the recognition Soderbergh, Roberts +Co deserved, as did this film, a chilling account of drug trafficking in North and Central America. As seen in 'Erin Brockovich', Soderbergh often deals with people under immense pressure, and this is quite evident here, telling the story of a new US drug control officer (Michael Douglas) whose daughter is rapidly becoming a drug addict (Erika Christensen). It also shows us the struggles of a drug trafficker's society wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones), whose husband is facing a conviction, and also that of a cop accused of corruption. The direction is superb throughout, speaking in tones, very believable tones, and contrasting atmospheres. The portrayal of Mexico, as a behind-the-scenes nightmare world of seediness, humidity (you can almost FEEL the heat) and as a place where one murder matters not, is handled excellently, Soderbergh quite cleverly using sepiatones to convey the mood. This high standard, which is often difficult to maintain in a movie of its length (2 ½ hours) is maintained, and while at times it borders on arty, it is done thoughtfully, incisively and effectively, the scenes of importance delivered in tense, muted tones. Javier Rodriguez's (Benicio Del Toro) character and personality is both strong and incredibly well-acted - the quiet, thick skinned yet razor-sharp mind suiting his environment perfectly, and his acting is often crucial to the moods set in the film, for example in creating the tense, unearthly atmosphere of Mexico. This quiet confidence is also a key part of one of the film's many underlying messages, namely a study in resourcefulness and where it gets us, particularly in Catherine Zeta-Jones' character, a trophy wife of a drug trafficker who is under arrest. Resourceful as she is, it takes her down the darkest and lowest moral alleyways, and this can be compared to 'Erin Brockovich', where another stressed woman used a different kind of soul and fighting spirit to get results. This film also deals with family life, and the movie cliché of 'daddy never being around' is handled exceptionally well. This time the daddy is the newly-instated drugs officer (Michael Douglas) fighting drugs on two fronts the Mexican Border and his own home, as he struggles to keep his adolescent daughter on the straight and narrow. The characters are all strong and well acted, I can't put my finger on a single bad performance, but Benicio Del Toro is by far the best on show and his Oscar was well deserved. Michael Douglas proves again that he's a class act, as does Catherine Zeta-Jones and strength in depth is clear all round. All in all, then, a great film, combining good acting, clever psychological undertones and classy direction, which particularly stands out. Combining an ability to keep us interested with the snappy, modern style which he has brought to the movies today - this film is a gripping account and a very comprehensive display of Soderbergh's impressive arsenal of film knowledge, understanding and talent.

Cyclops is my favorite character in the comic and in the movie.  He was stiff in the movie, yes.  Why?  Because that is the way he is in the comic books.Wolviren was not watered down because that is the way he is when he is with the X-Men.  He always takes a likin' to the younger person.There were ten characters.  It is hard enough to come up with enough for each.  They did a great job.There really isn't a lot about Cyclops to know other then he is stiff. Unless they wanted to tell about how he hit his head when he was yonger and that is why he has to wear a visor to keep from blasting everywhere.Wolviern is only human, partly, because he doesn't always act like a ravge beast.  He has a loving side to him.Rouge is not sassy.  She wasn't when she first found out about her powers. Now she became that way, and people who have read the comic books would know that.This movie was a start and it was a very good start.  It could have been better if they had the Beast and Gambit and Pyro, like they wanted, but the money was not put up by Fox.  Just like they wanted the Danger room in there too.As for comparing it to the Batman stuff, you cannot.  Batman was one character it was easier to make it and make it where you understand him and where he is coming from.  X-Men is based on many characters and therefore take longer to developed when they have to share the screen with others. Batman movies were good up to two.  Then they lost out.  So I hope it never compares to Batman since Batman droped after the second one.  X-Men, if handled right, will never drop.The X-Men in this movie stay with the charters that are true to the X-Men. I am a big fan and I see it.  There was not enough development but no one seems to understand how long the movie was and how many people were in the movie.  You barely got to know Magneto.  They didn't tell you that he has two children and that a mob killed his wife.  That his two children grow up to be against their father.  One being on the Advengers, Scarlet Witch, and one on one of the X-Teams, Quicksilver.  They didn't tell you that Profesor X has a step brother who is very strong and named the Juggernaut.  They didn't tell you that Cyclops has a brother and they were split in the adoption process.  That the person over the Adoption place Cyclops was at was owned by Mr. Sinister his nemises in years to come.  They didn't tell you that Storm was a Goddess and that she is claustrophobic.  They didn't tell you that Wolviren was an experiment and that Sabertooth was a part of that experiment but when Wolviren escaped he made Sabertooth lose out on it. They didn't tell you that Mystique had a real child and his name was Nightcrawler.  That she has a best friend named Destany.  There is so much that could have been said to make you care for them but that is too much in the time that was alloted.This movie was, as I said, a great start.

Cyclops is my favorite character in the comic and in the movie.  He was stiff in the movie, yes.  Why?  Because that is the way he is in the comic books.Wolviren was not watered down because that is the way he is when he is with the X-Men.  He always takes a likin' to the younger person.There were ten characters.  It is hard enough to come up with enough for each.  They did a great job.There really isn't a lot about Cyclops to know other then he is stiff. Unless they wanted to tell about how he hit his head when he was yonger and that is why he has to wear a visor to keep from blasting everywhere.Wolviern is only human, partly, because he doesn't always act like a ravge beast.  He has a loving side to him.Rouge is not sassy.  She wasn't when she first found out about her powers. Now she became that way, and people who have read the comic books would know that.This movie was a start and it was a very good start.  It could have been better if they had the Beast and Gambit and Pyro, like they wanted, but the money was not put up by Fox.  Just like they wanted the Danger room in there too.As for comparing it to the Batman stuff, you cannot.  Batman was one character it was easier to make it and make it where you understand him and where he is coming from.  X-Men is based on many characters and therefore take longer to developed when they have to share the screen with others. Batman movies were good up to two.  Then they lost out.  So I hope it never compares to Batman since Batman droped after the second one.  X-Men, if handled right, will never drop.The X-Men in this movie stay with the charters that are true to the X-Men. I am a big fan and I see it.  There was not enough development but no one seems to understand how long the movie was and how many people were in the movie.  You barely got to know Magneto.  They didn't tell you that he has two children and that a mob killed his wife.  That his two children grow up to be against their father.  One being on the Advengers, Scarlet Witch, and one on one of the X-Teams, Quicksilver.  They didn't tell you that Profesor X has a step brother who is very strong and named the Juggernaut.  They didn't tell you that Cyclops has a brother and they were split in the adoption process.  That the person over the Adoption place Cyclops was at was owned by Mr. Sinister his nemises in years to come.  They didn't tell you that Storm was a Goddess and that she is claustrophobic.  They didn't tell you that Wolviren was an experiment and that Sabertooth was a part of that experiment but when Wolviren escaped he made Sabertooth lose out on it. They didn't tell you that Mystique had a real child and his name was Nightcrawler.  That she has a best friend named Destany.  There is so much that could have been said to make you care for them but that is too much in the time that was alloted.This movie was, as I said, a great start.

Groves comes across as a combination of a compleat (sic) ass and an avuncular bumbler.

The Art of War is nothing more than a sick excuse for a movie.  It's a clear-cut case of stealing other stories, and rehashing them into making this movie.  Our hero, Neil Shaw, is just another wanna-be James Bond, while trying to save the world from the bad guys he discovers that he has been framed for the Ambassadors murder.  Throughout this movie, it is hard to trust that Shaw is the great hero the movie wants us to believe. There are many scenes that the viewer will recognize from other movies he or she has watched recently, all the way down to the Matrix-like gun fight between Shaw and the villain.  Not only are there holes in the plot big enough to drive a truck through, but there are so many effects shot that are hurtful to watch (such as the scene in the beginning of the movie with Snipes in the foreground, and the fireworks in the background). Wesley Snipes is not the right person for this job.  He was excellent in U.S. Marshals and Blade, but he should have just left this one alone.  Anne Archer and Michael Biehn round out this awful cast, and never does the director, Christian Duguay, make us believe that there is anything between the `love interest' and Snipes.  The directing is awful, the storyline lacks anything remotely original, and the choice of actors was downright WRONG.  It seems to me that the movie studio thought that with a name like &#145;Wesley Snipes' in the trailer, it would attract the necessary crowd&#133;they were wrong, as this movie took a horrific nose dive from the moment it hit the (sorrowful) theaters.

The Art of War is nothing more than a sick excuse for a movie.  It's a clear-cut case of stealing other stories, and rehashing them into making this movie.  Our hero, Neil Shaw, is just another wanna-be James Bond, while trying to save the world from the bad guys he discovers that he has been framed for the Ambassadors murder.  Throughout this movie, it is hard to trust that Shaw is the great hero the movie wants us to believe. There are many scenes that the viewer will recognize from other movies he or she has watched recently, all the way down to the Matrix-like gun fight between Shaw and the villain.  Not only are there holes in the plot big enough to drive a truck through, but there are so many effects shot that are hurtful to watch (such as the scene in the beginning of the movie with Snipes in the foreground, and the fireworks in the background). Wesley Snipes is not the right person for this job.  He was excellent in U.S. Marshals and Blade, but he should have just left this one alone.  Anne Archer and Michael Biehn round out this awful cast, and never does the director, Christian Duguay, make us believe that there is anything between the `love interest' and Snipes.  The directing is awful, the storyline lacks anything remotely original, and the choice of actors was downright WRONG.  It seems to me that the movie studio thought that with a name like &#145;Wesley Snipes' in the trailer, it would attract the necessary crowd&#133;they were wrong, as this movie took a horrific nose dive from the moment it hit the (sorrowful) theaters.

It seemed like maybe an action\/adventure type movie with some romance.  From the previews it looked good, from the reviews it sounded good.  But lately I haven't had much free time on my hands, so I only go see the movies i really wanna see.   Then I saw the Oscars.  I was amazed at how good it looked....i was like i have to go see this movie tomorrow..which I did.  Let me tell you, I have no clue how it even got nominated for a Oscar, let alone win one.  The movie is terrible.  I came to the movie expecting some sort of reality i could relate to, I never found any.  There is nothing in there that pulls you back to earth.  No sense of reality which completly ruins the movie. But that wasn't the only thing that ruins the movie.....but what is the movie?.. This movie contains hundreds of scenes that should have been on the cutting room floor.  What is the plot?..and why are there so many holes in it?..Such what is up with Jade Fox?...She is one of the biggest character...yet you know almost nothing about her.  Where did she come from, why was she like that....and on that note I will stop, because I don't want to ruin any of the movie so that you will be disappointed and upset when you walk you. I give it a 4\/10 for trying. ","genre":null},{"date":"30 March 2001","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  I heard about this movie a while back.

I had to drag my mom (a nice, normal kind of mom) out to see it with me. I think she fell asleep, but I was riveted. This movie single-handedly made me into a film lover and a jazz lover ... all in one afternoon. I went back the next day to see the movie again and to hear THAT music again. After the movie I searched high and low for a cassette containing both Body and Soul and Stardust.I'm not a filmmaker and feel very uncomfortable making any comments on any technical aspects of the film, but I'll make a few non-controversial remarks. I loved the collage quality of whole thing. For me, it never needed it to feel any more bound together than it was. I loved the scenes -- the freakshow, the hypocrisy of fans, the genuine tentativeness that sometimes comes with life (those scenes throwing Sandy together with children and animals), the scene where Sandy and Dorrie are reading the Sunday paper ... the movie just made sense to me. It felt like life itself, god knows, not MY life, but someone's REAL life. Seems strange since there were so many caricatures, but I guess that's how we process people in our minds. We can't possibly have room up there to store all the details of everybody and the less important ones become easily sorted extremes of themselves ... and it WAS about memories. Who remembers all the details about superfluous folk from days gone by? Don't memories take on that dreamy quality after awhile?No matter what movies come down the road, this will always be one of my favorites because I just love the way it influenced my life.
