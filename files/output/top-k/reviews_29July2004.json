[{"date":"29 July 2004","score":"0 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":"  Ravenous does for cannibalism what Near Dark did for vampirism; in that it features a character that gets drawn into something they don't want to be a part of against their will. The film, aside from being an excellent horror movie, is also a metaphor of Benjamin Franklin's proverb; Eat to live, don't live to eat, and it probes into the immoral side of the human mind through that. The plot follows the story of army captain, John Boyd, who wins promotion through defeating the enemy command in the Mexican-American war. However, due to his actions stemming from an act of cowardice, he is given a promotion as third in command at a rubbish base; Fort Spencer. When a stranger named Colquhoun turns up at the base, frost bitten and close to death; he tells his disturbing story; one of starvation and cannibalism.Three very good actors head the cast of Ravenous. Guy Pierce, who really is underrated, gives a great performance here as the cowardly army captain John Boyd; he creates just the right atmosphere for his character and therefore we are able to feel empathetic towards him when he finds himself in an unenviable position later on in the film. The second starring performance comes from Robert Carlyle; a man who has gotten a name for himself by playing unstable characters, and this movie features another of those performances. I don't think they could have cast the part of Colquhoun any better; Carlysle does the insane madman side of his character admirably, and he also manages to get the other side of the character; that of an immoral and emotionless human being spot on too. The third starring role is lesser than the other two, but comes from Jeffrey Jones. Jones has been in a few well-known movies, such as Sleepy Hollow; another 1999 horror movie, and yet has never really won any acclaim. I recognised him in the movie, but I didn't know his name.One of the best things about Ravenous is the music, which is played almost constantly throughout the film. This collaborates with the images on screen brilliantly; bringing a great atmosphere to the film as the music changes with the mood. The music makes the images on screen more powerful and memorable as it fuses so well. Another thing about Ravenous is it's abundant comedy angle; from the start of the film I thought I was in for an absurd black comedy, and I was half right as the film does feature several moments of comedy alongside it's buckets of gore and disgusting make-up effects. The comedy in the movie isn't misplaced either and it overall makes for a very strange feel to the film, which is most definitely to the movie's credit.Ravenous is a unique, darkly comic and very gory movie, and should please horror movie fans no end and this film therefore comes with the highest recommendation.
