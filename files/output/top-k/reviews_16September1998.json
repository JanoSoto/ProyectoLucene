I must say that I was disappointed at this one. There was very little originality. Many of the characters were simply there to get laughs and to be killed off and it's obvious that the film was very under -written.A huge meteor is headed for Earth!!. Can someone say Deep Impact? C'mon! ! We've seen this already!!A major problem that I had with Armageddon was that it could not keep an even half-way serious attitude about itself for over five minutes. One minute, Bruce Willis' character and his friends are chosen to save the planet. The next minute, the big black guy takes off his clothes, starts dancing on a table and before you know it, the theater is roaring with laughter. Really now!! Was that necessary?There are definitely a few things I would change about this movie, if only I could. First, I would make it shorter. The movie was just too long and it didn't keep me interested. I found myself looking at my watch quite a bit. Second, I would cut out all of it's stupid, fifth-grade humor. With a plot set-up like this, it definitely calls for more of a serious attitude from the characters. Last (but certainly not least), I would somehow find a way to combine all of the useless characters into a single useless character. There were way too many people in the film that didn't even need to be there.Another thing that dissapointed me (and this is not about the movie) was the actor, Steve Buscemi. C'mon now!! To play parts in all these big summer blockbusters (Escape From L.A., Con-Air, Armageddon) and to act out the exact same type of character each time? Buscemi always plays the wise -cracking, comic relief. I feel typecast coming on for Steve Buscemi.Armageddon did have it's good points (like the ending credits, when I got to leave), but they were certainly not very note-worthy. After the movie was over, I weighed the pros and cons and came to the conclusion that the cons outweighed the pros by almost seven times. This film was an absolute waste of time and money. Anyone who is serious about movies, should pass this one up. In ten years, everyone will have forgotten about it. I just pray that there will not be an Armageddon 2.

Such is the case, especially, with Independent-type art house films like The Ice Storm. While it features an all-star cast (Kevin Kline, Sigourney Weaver, Elijah Wood, Christina Ricci), the plot is subdued, virtually non-existent, as it starts in the middle of these people's lives and ends in the middle as well. It's the story of families, dysfunctional just as it was becoming trendy in the 1970's, who share nothing with each other, but heartache and cold emotionless relationships with everyone. Each character shows little care or concern for one another - only a blank love-void existence. The 70 's were a decade of experimentation with drugs, sex, and alcohol - and everyone, children included, are involved in this exploration.The performances put in by the children outshine their more famous adult co -stars, and that's good. Because it's easy for adults to play emotionless characters - they get plenty of practice. But for child actors to extinguish their natural emotions for a life completely void of feelings is difficult. Sigourney Weaver received a Golden Globe nomination, but I would rather have seen Christian Ricci recognized for her performance. She has a long career ahead of her.This movie is not a pleasant film experience - instead it serves as a warning, or a lesson, or maybe just a look at life and how it is.

Unfortunately this leads me to believe that there will be a sequel to this movie, which I make no intention in seeing.... ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Family"},{"date":"16 September 1998","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  I recently had a chance to see the AMC top one hundred movies, and was a little hurt and confused that Schindler's List lost to a movie that very few people have heard of. In my opinion, Schindler's List IS the best movie of time. No movie has ever made me cry until that one. Steven Spielbergs masterful direction was great, but also the stellar cast. Of all, Ben Kingsley was most definetely the best, but great performances by Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes as well. John William's score was the most masterful, powerful, and beautiful I have ever heard. Normally most Nazi movies tend to focus on one family surviving, and although that isn't bad, Schindler's List is much better. It shows the Holocaust as it really was. I hear people criticize Spielberg because he showed full nudity of both sexes, and many acts of violence, and I say, shut up. Now that isn't to say that this is a movie for small children. But if you feel they are ready for it I suggest you rent it and let your teenage son or daughter watch it(with them of course). This is truly the #1 movie. Rent it and see it.
