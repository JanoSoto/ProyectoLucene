Dinosaur tells the tale of an ambitious dinosaur named Aladar (voiced by D.B. Sweeney) who is plucked out of his mother's nest and carried off to some unsuspecting primates. As he grows he accepts the frisky primates as his  family. Just as the yearly mating ritual begins, Aladar's surroundings are engulfed in a cosmic event forcing Aladar to scoop up his adopted family and flee the safety of their island. Returning to the real world proves a challenge for Aladar and his adopted primate family as they try so hard to fit in with a huge migrating herd. Dinosaur's amazing visuals and breath-taking scenery shots hold you breathless as you escape into a world completely fixated on the instinct of survival. What seems to be the fault associated with Dinosaur is the story and emotion associated with its characters. Sure when Disney creates animated characters our human emotions and actions are often placed into the hearts of the depicted characters but here it seems almost strange. Here we have photo realistic surroundings and characters trying to be lifted from dinosaur history books. A couple years back a breakthrough film called `The Land Before Time' embraced the idea of telling a dinosaur story using Disney-style animation. It was a marvelous accomplishment but here it's very weird. That very thing addresses some issues concerning what exactly is cartoon-violence and what is real to you and your child. Some scenes are vicious and profound as we watch Aladar's constant struggle for survival in an untamed world. Through these scenes we do have to wonder which particular audience was the film being aimed. I know for younger viewers the realism and the intensity in the art of survival may be too much to handle. It's hard to judge which exact child may cringe while another might be excited. Dinosaur has pushed the envelope in regards to how real we really want to get with animation. The plot elements that baffled me were during Aladar's communication with the huge titanic Brachiosaurus, Baylene (voiced by Joan Plowright). In the introduction scene to Baylene, she is a giant and Aladar is worried about being stepped on. But as he gets to know her she seems to shrink and not be that large at all. And to top it all off Aladar is able to fit Baylene, himself and three other dinosaurs in a cave. That must be some cave and how come the herd never could see a cave that huge? Sure I am being analytical on a family film but the film is trying for as much realism as necessary. Dinosaur is more convincing and real than the `Land Before Time' but no where near as family or sincere as that film. I think it tries to be family at one moment and too realistic the next.

In nearly every respect.I suppose I should note that the ear-bleeding sound effects sounded pretty realistic.  And they were loud.  So the guy who did the sound shouldn't be ashamed.  Everyone else that worked on this movie, bow your heads.Director Roger Christian has put together one of the worst movies sci-fi or otherwise that I have seen.  Loaded with uninteresting characters, a dumb plot, ridiculous gaping holes in logic, terrible direction, only so-so special effects, and a huge length for a movie this bad (over two hours), Battlefield Earth is already being compared to Plan 9 From Outer Space.  In my book, it's a fair comparison.Take the direction.  Sure Ed Wood had no clue what he was doing, but at least he pointed the camera directly at the actors when they talked.  Christian decides he's going to be original and tilt the camera at least 45 degrees everytime someone says anything.  The whole movie I was tilting my head side to side, trying to keep up.The effects, well Plan 9 had pie tins in strings.  Battlefield Earth has a couple of nifty CGI effects, but the final length battle sequence is filmed in a very dark blue setting, rendering it impossible to see who is shooting who at any given moment.  Of course, even if I had known it wouldn't have made much of a difference because I really didn't care about any of the characters one way or another.Gaping continuity?  Well, Plan 9 had scenes in cars that began in the day, then turned to night when people got out of the cars.  In Battlefield Earth, the Psychlos can discover gold veins in difficult to reach mountains, but somehow totally miss out on Fort Knox, still completely stocked with gold 1,000 years in the future.  Cavemen learn not only to speak and work together, but operate Harrier jets within a week.  How did they learn you ask?

There is a lot to swallow in this movie, as in all sci-fi movies, but this was a just too much. Now, the overall plot isn't that bad I suppose.  From what people tell me, some of it doesn't make sense because parts from the book were deleted. HOW BIG IS THIS BOOK?  It's slated to be a trilogy and you can't have the movies make sense?

This is partly because its characters are likeable and realistic, and also because it doesn't hedge its bets on the heroine, played by Julia Roberts as a flawed woman but earnest in her desire to win over the man she recently discovered she loves.   The movie opens by introducing us to Robert's character, named Julianne, a successful food critic who is having a conversation with her editor, George, as she prepares her latest review.  She describes to him how she met her best friend, Michael, and how they had a brief fling and remained close afterward.  They made the kind of promise you make when you're young and drunk, that if they were both still single when they turned 28, they would marry each other.  She hasn't heard from him in months, but just got a phone message from him that he really needs to talk to her, right away.  She assumes, naturally, that he's going to propose.  He surprises her by informing her that he has proposed, all right, to someone else (she falls off the bed as she hears this).  He wants her to come to the wedding, and she agrees, reluctantly, and hysterically describes to George that she has four days to ruin this, she says, angrily describing how he was in love with me for nine years!  Later on, though, she realizes that she really does love the guy, and is desperate to make him realize that he loves her, too (if, in fact, he does).  Most movies like this would make the intended bride to be someone unpleasant, so that we would feel good about the way the heroine breaks things up.  But in this case she turns out to be nice; named Kimberly and played by Cameron Diaz, she has an attractive, sunny personality that we like immediately.  She gives Julianne a big hug when she meets her, asks her to be her maid-of-honor, and says I have four days to make you my new best friend.  She understands the way Michael feels about her, and confesses that she felt competitive at first but decided that You win.  He's got you on a pedestal and me in his arms.  This defuses any real way that Kimberly could be the villain, and indeed, even Julianne has a hard time scheming against her, admitting that I could adore her, if I didn't hate her so much.  But scheme she does, first making Kimberly sing at a karaoke bar, revealing how terrible her singing voice is, and later creating an argument for them.  Both fail to accomplish anything.  But she's only getting started, and soon has committed a deed so nasty (I won't say what) that we begin, surprisingly, to turn against her somewhat.  If she doesn't succeed, we'll feel that she is only getting what she deserves.   Julianne could save herself, and everyone else, a lot of grief if she simply took George's advice and told Michael how she feels but, of course, then there wouldn't be much of a movie.  And it's hard not to appreciate her fear to learn exactly how Michael feels about her.  On the other hand, rejection couldn't be nearly as bad as what Julianne does to try to destroy Michael and Kimberly's wedding, and their happiness.   The movie is interesting in the way it sets up its characters and the situation, and makes us really care about what will happen.  Because we like Julianne but can't condone her actions, and Kimberly comes off as such a nice person, we're not sure how the plot will work out.  That was a welcome surprise for me, since most movies like this are predictable right down to the ending.  I also liked the way the movie focuses on Julianne's point of view and didn't try to follow all the characters around on their own.  In one scene, when Julianne is pursing someone down a busy highway, we don't get a silly chase seen with external shots of the cars being driven by professionals.  Instead, the camera stays with Julianne and we get a better sense of her desperation.  The movie has good actors doing good work.  Diaz has the challenge of making us like Kimberly even though she represents an obstacle to Julianne's happiness.  Dermot Mulroney creates a interesting character out of Michael, making him intelligent and caring; at a crucial moment he is able to read a situation in two different ways, and chooses the one that is more understanding.  Rupert Everett is enjoyable as George; although he's gay, he comes to Julianne's aid by playing the part of her fiance, but understands how insane her plan is and states firmly to her that there is still a very small window of opportunity left for you to do the right thing.   But Roberts has the toughest role, because she has to play the heroine and the villain all rolled into one.  She is convincing in her ability to win us over even while we disagree with her tactics.  Funny, how we sometimes don't notice when we love someone until the opportunity to do something about it has passed us by.  Why are we wired like that?  Wouldn't it be easier to be aware of our feelings when it was still practical?  Ah, but then movies like this one wouldn't exist.

Dermot Mulroney creates a interesting character out of Michael, making him intelligent and caring; at a crucial moment he is able to read a situation in two different ways, and chooses the one that is more understanding.  Rupert Everett is enjoyable as George; although he's gay, he comes to Julianne's aid by playing the part of her fiance, but understands how insane her plan is and states firmly to her that there is still a very small window of opportunity left for you to do the right thing.   But Roberts has the toughest role, because she has to play the heroine and the villain all rolled into one.  She is convincing in her ability to win us over even while we disagree with her tactics.  Funny, how we sometimes don't notice when we love someone until the opportunity to do something about it has passed us by.  Why are we wired like that?  Wouldn't it be easier to be aware of our feelings when it was still practical?  Ah, but then movies like this one wouldn't exist.

The characters in the movie are complex-yet so funny and likeable at the same time. You sympathize with them-no matter how desperate or unreasonable they may become. It is a very avant-gard movie-but without being too artsy or annoying. Cameron Diaz proves that she is not just another actress turned model with a pretty face-but that she actually has real talent and can act. The always cool John Cusack proves to the audience again that he is one of the most versatile actors in Hollywood and Katherine Keener does indeed give an Oscar Worthy performance as the ambitious Machiavellian gorgeous co-worker-who acts as the catalyst in the movie. It is so refreshing to see a movie that does no t follow the standard Hollywood formula of predictability. Spike Jonze truly deserved the nomination for Best Director.
