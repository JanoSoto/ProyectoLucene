Credit has to go to creators George Lucas and Larry Kasdan, but the real kudos have to go to Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford for creating an new iconic action hero, and to holding the viewer spellbound with a exciting, amusing and emotionally involving movie, while at the same time paying homage to the Republic serials of the thirties, and elevating the action movie making spectacle much higher than the Bond movie franchise, which was the major action movie brand at the time. The plot moves quickly, thanks to a sharp and witty script by Larry Kasdan, based upon ideas from Lucas, Kasdan, film-maker Philip Kaufman, and Spielberg himself. The film's opening sequence is mirrors the Bond pre-credits sequence, with the viewer thrown straight into an action\/thriller sequence with little explanation, followed by a dialogue driven sequence to flesh out the plot. It works extremely well and involves the viewer in the story very quickly. Harrison Ford understands the role perfectly, and the character having moments of fallibility and things going wrong, and having to adapt to the ebbing of success and failure for the character in the story is fun to watch. Ford doesn't play to the character too broadly, and the Indiana Jones character is more fleshed out than Han Solo in Star Wars Episodes IV to VI. Gravitas is provided by an excellent performance by the late Denholm Elliot as Dr Marcus Brody, and a strong performance by John Rhys Davies as Salah. Most of the other parts are very theatrical in nature and are clearly driven by Spielberg's and Lucas's view to have a performance style similar to the Saturday matin√©e serials of the 1930s, and while work well within the context of the film, weren't memorable. Spielberg as the director is on top form here, and for me is still his second best action\/adventure film (after Jurassic Park). He understands what is needed for an entertaining and enthralling story, and keeps the interest and suspense levels high throughout the film. No scene or sequence is wasteful and everything you see, no matter how spectacular, character based, funny or frightening is there to serve the story and move it along very briskly. Spielberg orchestrates the action sequences with style, humour and panache, but most notably emotional involvement. He gets the audience to follow the character(s) within the action sequence, rather than just show an action sequence for the technical achievement's sake. The stunt-work is still impressive by today's standards, with able support from George Lucas and Michael Moore as the film's 2nd unit directors. Spielberg's editor Michael Kahn edits the footage perfectly to produce and wonderfully entertaining movie, and deservedly won an Oscar for his work. Spielberg's collaboration with veteran photographer Douglas Slocombe was outstanding and gave the film a stylish yet real feel, and they would work together on the subsequent two sequels.The film is also first rate in other technical areas, that also serve to highlight the excellent story and support Spielberg's outstanding directing. Star Wars alumni Norman Reynolds, together with his art direction team won an academy award for the production design. ILM veterans Richard Edlund, Bruce Nicholson and Joe Johnston all won Oscars for the near seamless blend of visual effects into the live action. Richard Edlund had already won Oscars for his work on Star Episodes IV and V would go on to win again for Episode VI, before heading up a highly successful visual effects company (Entertainment Effects Group, which became known later as BOSS film) and overseeing fx a work on a series of high profile films including Ghostbusters, 2010, Die Hard. Air Force One and Charlie Wilson's War. Bruce Nicholson was responsible for the excellent compositing of the visual effects, and has a very successful career in this field, working on many high profile films, including the Matrix and Spiderman sequels. Joe Johnston went on a very successful career as a film director of films such as Honey I Shrunk the Kids! Jurassic Park III and more recently, the Wolfman. Kit West was responsible for the mechanical effects on the film, and has worked on a large body of films since, including Stargate and the Bourne Supremacy. The sound team of Bill Varney, Steve Maslow, Gregg Landaker, Roy Charman, Ben Burtt and Richard Anderson and did outstanding work and deservedly took home Oscar accolades.Spielberg already had developed a very successful collaboration with composer John Williams, and it was this experience that led to George Lucas working with Williams on the Star Wars films. Williams continues this tradition of old fashioned, rousing scores with another outstanding score. The Raiders March has become almost as iconic as Star Wars in the movie history and popular culture. The music works brilliantly throughout the film, enhancing it wonderfully, and building brilliantly to a superb climax and a gentle but mysterious coda. It is a key part of making this film one of the best action\/adventure films ever.Concluding, congratulations must go to Mr Spielberg for delivering a remarkable and piece of all out escapist entertainment, that has stood the test of time remarkably well, and has never been bettered by any of the sequels, even though Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade comes very close.

Can a fellow be a villain all his life? ¬®¬®Oliver! ¬® is my favorite Musical of all time, but it could very well be called ¬®Fagin! ¬® because Ron Moody's performance as Fagin is truly the highlight of the film. He shines in every scene he's in and his musical pieces ¬®You've Got to Pick a Pocket or Two¬® and ¬®Reviewing the Situation¬® are the best ones in the movie. Even Oliver's buddy, the Artful Dodger played by Jack Wild, steals each scene he shares with Mark Lester, who plays the main character Oliver. The film which is based on Lionel Bart's musical adaptation of Charles Dickens's novel, Oliver Twist, had been produced for the stage in London before they decided to turn it into a film. The screenplay adaptation for the movie was written by Vernon Harris. The characters are just as I would have imagined them from reading Dickens's novel and I don't have a problem with Fagin and The Artful Dodger stealing the show from the protagonist because that is what happens most of the time with Dickens's main characters in his novels. He is so good at creating remarkable characters and I remember these two were the most memorable in the novel as well. Oliver Twist serves more as a symbol of innocence and purity among an evil world that has turned its back on him, and his goodness proves to be incorruptible even among these villains he lives with. I am a huge fan of Charles Dickens and I really believe this film lived up to it although it was very loosely based on the novel because you just can't fit everything into the movie and some of the characters had to be left out (Monks, Mrs. Maylie, Henry and Rose for example), or they didn't have much screen time as is the case with Mr. Bumble.The movie begins in a workhouse several miles from London where several young orphans are forced to work and live under harsh conditions. One of the orphans, Oliver Twist (Mark Lester) is chosen by the rest of the kids to ask for more food because it is hardly enough. Oliver is a shy good looking kid, but when he asks Mr. Bumble (Harry Secombe) for more food he is instantly put in discipline for misconduct. He decides to sell the boy because he has become an inconvenience. Oliver eventually escapes and is able to arrive at London where he meets another young boy about his age who introduces himself as The Artful Dodger (Jack Wild). The Dodger offers Oliver a place to sleep and introduces him to Fagin (Ron Moody) and the rest of the boys. Fagin happens to be a thief who trains the children how to pick a pocket and steal valuable goods like wallets and handkerchiefs from distracted men in the streets. Oliver is innocent and doesn't really understand what is going on until the day he goes on his very first mission with the Dodger and he is mistakenly accused of stealing a man's wallet. Oliver is finally declared innocent after an eyewitness claims it was another boy who was trying to steal the wallet and Mr. Brownlow (Joseph O'Conner) apologizes to him and adopts him at his home. In the meantime Fagin is worried the boy will give up his hideout along with his partner in crime, Bill Sikes (Oliver Reed). Bill forces his girlfriend Nancy (Shani Wallis) to kidnap Oliver and bring him back and the plot develops from that point on.Oliver! won six Oscars in 1968, including best picture, and was the last musical to win an Oscar until Chicago won it in 2005. Carol Reed also won for best direction and he really raised the bar for musicals ever since. It was probably the last of the great musicals. Perhaps the hardest character to portray in this film from the novel was Nancy because she is torn between her love for Bill and doing the right thing for Oliver. Shani Wallis does a good job of portraying this inner struggle which eventually leads her to her fate. Oliver Reed had to portray the darkest and most evil character of the novel, Bill Sikes, and he does a good job as well. Some of the other musical numbers I enjoyed were ¬®Who Will Buy? ¬® and ¬®Oom-Pah-Pah.¬® The art directions and scenery were also really well done for the time period. I don't know if I would of enjoyed the movie as much as I did if it weren't for Moody's performance. He was great and I think he should have won the Oscar for Best Secondary Actor. Robin Williams's performance in August Rush was probably influenced by Moody's character in this film. He was just a pleasure to watch on screen and is the main reason why I like this Musical so much. I am not a big fan of musicals, but this is definitely my favorite one and I recommend it.http\/\/estebueno10.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"2 October 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" ¬®I'm reviewing the situation.

Oliver Twist serves more as a symbol of innocence and purity among an evil world that has turned its back on him, and his goodness proves to be incorruptible even among these villains he lives with. I am a huge fan of Charles Dickens and I really believe this film lived up to it although it was very loosely based on the novel because you just can't fit everything into the movie and some of the characters had to be left out (Monks, Mrs. Maylie, Henry and Rose for example), or they didn't have much screen time as is the case with Mr. Bumble.The movie begins in a workhouse several miles from London where several young orphans are forced to work and live under harsh conditions. One of the orphans, Oliver Twist (Mark Lester) is chosen by the rest of the kids to ask for more food because it is hardly enough. Oliver is a shy good looking kid, but when he asks Mr. Bumble (Harry Secombe) for more food he is instantly put in discipline for misconduct. He decides to sell the boy because he has become an inconvenience. Oliver eventually escapes and is able to arrive at London where he meets another young boy about his age who introduces himself as The Artful Dodger (Jack Wild). The Dodger offers Oliver a place to sleep and introduces him to Fagin (Ron Moody) and the rest of the boys. Fagin happens to be a thief who trains the children how to pick a pocket and steal valuable goods like wallets and handkerchiefs from distracted men in the streets. Oliver is innocent and doesn't really understand what is going on until the day he goes on his very first mission with the Dodger and he is mistakenly accused of stealing a man's wallet. Oliver is finally declared innocent after an eyewitness claims it was another boy who was trying to steal the wallet and Mr. Brownlow (Joseph O'Conner) apologizes to him and adopts him at his home. In the meantime Fagin is worried the boy will give up his hideout along with his partner in crime, Bill Sikes (Oliver Reed). Bill forces his girlfriend Nancy (Shani Wallis) to kidnap Oliver and bring him back and the plot develops from that point on.Oliver! won six Oscars in 1968, including best picture, and was the last musical to win an Oscar until Chicago won it in 2005. Carol Reed also won for best direction and he really raised the bar for musicals ever since. It was probably the last of the great musicals. Perhaps the hardest character to portray in this film from the novel was Nancy because she is torn between her love for Bill and doing the right thing for Oliver. Shani Wallis does a good job of portraying this inner struggle which eventually leads her to her fate. Oliver Reed had to portray the darkest and most evil character of the novel, Bill Sikes, and he does a good job as well. Some of the other musical numbers I enjoyed were ¬®Who Will Buy? ¬® and ¬®Oom-Pah-Pah.¬® The art directions and scenery were also really well done for the time period. I don't know if I would of enjoyed the movie as much as I did if it weren't for Moody's performance. He was great and I think he should have won the Oscar for Best Secondary Actor. Robin Williams's performance in August Rush was probably influenced by Moody's character in this film. He was just a pleasure to watch on screen and is the main reason why I like this Musical so much. I am not a big fan of musicals, but this is definitely my favorite one and I recommend it.http\/\/estebueno10.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":"Drama, Family, Musical"},{"date":"2 October 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" ¬®I'm reviewing the situation. Can a fellow be a villain all his life? ¬®¬®Oliver! ¬® is my favorite Musical of all time, but it could very well be called ¬®Fagin! ¬® because Ron Moody's performance as Fagin is truly the highlight of the film. He shines in every scene he's in and his musical pieces ¬®You've Got to Pick a Pocket or Two¬® and ¬®Reviewing the Situation¬® are the best ones in the movie. Even Oliver's buddy, the Artful Dodger played by Jack Wild, steals each scene he shares with Mark Lester, who plays the main character Oliver. The film which is based on Lionel Bart's musical adaptation of Charles Dickens's novel, Oliver Twist, had been produced for the stage in London before they decided to turn it into a film. The screenplay adaptation for the movie was written by Vernon Harris.

His next film was meant to be produced by David O. Selznick, but because of other projects by him and the budget of Notorious, he sold the whole package to RKO which gave the artistic freedom back to Hitchcock. Notorious is a spy-film set in its own post war time. It's a picture of the time just after the WWII and before the Cold War which is quite an interesting period. The film suffered from censorship due to its references to the nuclear bombs of the United States but eventually found its way to the screens.A Nazi's daughter Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman) is being followed by the media and the police because of her father got just an imprisonment. In a party, after the trial, Alicia becomes acquainted with Devlin (Cary Grant) who soon turns out to be a cop. Devlin persuades Alicia to help the Government to get information of his father's Nazi companions who have escaped to Brazil. The leader of the Nazis is Sebastian (Claude Rains) who once was in love with Alicia. The task starts getting unpleasant features when Sebastian falls in love with Alicia again and Alicia falls in love with Devlin, who seems to be neglecting her.Notorious is a very intriguing film. Francois Truffaut called it Hitchcock's greatest love film and the best black-and-white film ever made. And Patricia Hitchcock, daughter of Alfred, has named the film as her personal favorite of her father's films. Notorious has clearly established its place as a Hitchcock-classic. One of the most famous scenes of it is the long kissing scene where Cary and Ingrid kiss each other while talking at the same. This brilliantly built scene full of erotic tension was actually quite sly by Hitchcock. People weren't allowed to kiss longer than 3 seconds in films during the 1940's so Hitchcock decided to give some dialog to the characters in the middle of the kisses and this is actually much more excitatory that just showing a long dull kiss.Many might call Notorious a film-noir whose main hallmarks are the use of shadow and light, moral complexity, the aesthetics of big cities and after WWII; the postwar disillusions. Hitchcock only did a few film-noirs but they were all amazing Shadow of a Doubt, Spellbound, Suspicion, The Wrong Man and Strangers on a Train. But the strongest portrayal of post-war disillusions is in Notorious -- probably because it was made in the time. The criticism for the politics of the United States is very subtle but today one can see it in the small things; The Government of the United States 'sacrifices' a woman just for its own benefit and the captain Paul Prescott is without a doubt the most obnoxious character of Notorious.The references Hitchcock made about the nuclear bomb made the Government to suspect him and he was actually added to FBI's list of possible foreign agents which Hitchcock himself only found hilarious. Notorious is a brilliant picture of its time but it also works as an entertaining spy-film. No one has been able to build such great excitement as Hitchcock. The narrative and the visual clarity of Notorious are just spellbinding. Notorious is also a clever film about the difficulty of expressing yourself and your emotions. Cary Grant plays this laconic character who clearly is in love with Bergman's character, but somehow can't show it. He becomes jealous of her because of something he forced her to do -- the irony is lovely! Some say that the film is very dark because Hitchcock had just been editing The Memories of the Camps, a documentary about the concentration camps, but I personally think it's just part of the film-noir cinematography which he handled very well. Of course the postwar disillusions made the film what it is but I don't think it would have been any more 'joyful' without The Memories of the Camps. Alfred Hitchcock is the only director who has been able to film directly and without explaining emotions such as suspicion, jealousy, envy and yearning.

An American in Paris was one of the earliest examples of this sub-genre. Like most of the other Parisian musicals, it is set in a city which bears only a passing resemblance to the actual capital of France. The Paris of the Hollywood imagination is a highly idealised city of love, romance and culture, the sort of place where everyone is either a painter, a poet or a bohemian intellectual. (It is not just Paris which gets treated in this way; the Hollywood version of London is a place few Londoners would recognise. Moreover, French film-makers are equally capable of idealising their national capital, Am√©lie being a case in point). The geography of the city can be rearranged as well; in An American in Paris Jerry tells us that he lives on the Left Bank, even though the district where he lives is clearly Montmartre, which is on the Right Bank. (The mistake probably arose because Montmartre has a Bohemian reputation, similar to that of some Left Bank districts such as the Quartier Latin). An American in Paris was a piece of music long before it was a film musical, George Gershwin's piece having been written in 1928. The idea of basing a musical around a purely orchestral composition is an unusual one, and it is perhaps not surprising that the plot is rather sketchy. Like a number of other musicals from this period it consists of little more than a boy, a girl and a happy ending. The boy in this case is Jerry Mulligan, an American World War II veteran now trying to earn a living as a painter in Paris. The girl is Jerry's young French girlfriend Lise Bouvier. (He generally mispronounces her name as Lisa, but neither she not anyone else comments on this). What dramatic tension there is arises from the fact that both Jerry and Lise have other romantic interests, hers being Henri Baurel, a singer and an old family friend, and his being his wealthy patron, Milo Roberts, who seems interested in him for more than his art. (No, this is not the first gay Hollywood musical; Milo, named after the Venus de, is a woman). Some have complained that this structure results in an unhappy ending for two people, but I doubt if audiences at the time were too worried. Milo, pushy, possessive and domineering, is a rather unsympathetic character. Henri is more likable, but it is clear that although Lise loves him she only does so as a father-figure, not in a romantic way as a potential husband. Some of the casting seems rather odd; the plot implies that both Milo and Henri are considerably older than Jerry, but in fact Georges Gu√©tary was three years younger than Gene Kelly and Nina Foch twelve. (Foch, a pretty twenty-something in 1951, seems particularly miscast as Milo). The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture, something which has also given rise to some controversy, especially as the competition included films as good as A Streetcar Named Desire and A Place in the Sun. (There were other excellent films from that year like The African Queen, The Red Badge of Courage and Show Boat which were not even nominated). Yet I think that the Academy's decision can be defended. An American in Paris has many virtues. Gene Kelly may have been wrong for the part of Jerry in terms of age, but in every other respect he was right for it, as the film appears to have been specifically designed to suit his talents. As a singer he was perhaps nothing special- in his duet with Gu√©tary it is the Frenchman who has the better voice- but as a dancer he had few, if any, equals. He could make the most difficult dance moves look effortless and nonchalant, and the dance sequences in this film, especially his final ballet, set to Gershwin's piece from which the film takes its name, exploit this ability to the maximum. Leslie Caron also gets the chance here to show that she was a fine dancer in her own right. (She was to star in two further Parisian musicals, Lili and Gigi. The second of these had the same director as An American in Paris, Vincente Minnelli, and also won Best Picture). The film's other two strengths are the music and the look of the film. Besides Gershwin's famous orchestral piece there are also a number of well-known songs by him (I Got Rhythm, 'S Wonderful, Our Love is Here to Stay, etc). The sets for the final ballet are particularly striking, being influenced by various Impressionist and Post-Impressionist painters. (The most direct references are to Toulouse-Lautrec, but there are also hints that this sequence was influenced by Seurat, Renoir and others). Another notable sequence is the costume ball with everyone in black-and-white costumes, which inspired a similar scene in My Fair Lady.Contrary to what some might think (and others might prefer), there is no rule which says that the Best Picture award has to go to a serious film each year rather a light-hearted one. An American in Paris may lack the serious purpose of A Streetcar Named Desire or A Place in the Sun, but it is a fine film, one of the most inventive and exuberant musicals of its period. This is certainly not one of the Academy's egregious mistakes like the one they were to make the following year, when they somehow managed to give the award to The Greatest Show on Earth ahead of High Noon and failed even to nominate that other fine Gene Kelly musical, Singin' in the Rain. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"2 October 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" A number of American musicals of the 1950s were set in Paris (April in Paris, Gentlemen Marry Brunettes, Lili, Funny Face, Gigi), so much so that the Parisian musical almost became a sub-genre in its own right.

Since I'm not a fan I can only mention as other members of the set Clueless and Pretty Persuasion. The genre is characterized by the central character of a young woman, usually in high school or college, various intrigues and power plays, a ludic tenor, and cute dialog, sometimes pretty clever. The title of this film is an example of what I mean. Legally Blond. (Based on the expression legally blind, get it?) It's filled with resonance. Stereotypical blondes are stupid. Yet, in this movie, Reese Witherspoon outwits everyone else in sight while a first-year law student at Harvard. Law justifies legally.Well, I don't know nothing about no snooty schools like Harvard. No, nor not much else neither. An ex-friend once dissed me by saying I didn't have too much in the upper story. Okay, so's I don't know nothing about law but I know what I like. And I am like hip enough not to shoot up in front of a police station.I'm not sure Reese Witherspoon's character is even that sophisticated at the beginning of this film. She's a Southern Californian airhead who just finished college with a major in Fashion Design Marketing. She wears too much make up, sports tiny pink clothes, mussitates over Cosmo, and bears the usual earmarks of surferhood. But when her patrician boyfriend leaves for Harvard Law, she decides to apply too, just to be near him, and she's accepted for reasons only the screenwriters know.But the movie doesn't skewer Reese Witherspoon any more than most of the other characters. Stereotypes abound. Harvard Law students, for instance, are all a bunch of nail-biting neurotics or loud-mouthed megalomaniacs. It's probably not necessary to spell out the rest of the plot.

I guess the film is most notable for introducing to the world the characters Jay and Silent Bob, and if you don't know who those guys are then you're probably reading the wrong review! But more of that later, here's a short plot summary before I tell you want I really think.Dante works in a convenience store. It is his day off but his boss has called him in to cover for him. The day starts normally enough, but he can't open the main shutters because someone has put gum in the locks. His girlfriend, Veronica, comes in to see him on her way to college. She thinks he could do better and tries to persuade him to join her at college. Dante is stuck in his ways and is happy to stay at the store for the time being. After she leaves, Randal arrives to open the video rental store next door. He spends most of the day closing the video store so he can go and hang out with Dante. It transpires that Dante is still holding a torch for his ex-girlfriend, Caitlin and has recently been in touch with her. When the pair, Dante and Randal that is, discover that Caitlin is engaged to be married, things get really interesting. Throw in a hockey game on the roof, a funeral, a death and the lamest fight scene I've ever seen and that about covers it.I will admit I did find the character of Randal pretty annoying although he did talk a lot of sense in the end.

Sure they found a clever way to undo the closure of Halloween H2O and make it possible to bring Mike up to his old shenanigans, unfortunately that whole segment is hasty and the rest of the movie's garbage. The what really happened explanation is just a loophole for making a movie that's neither necessary nor any good, and so I present to you Halloween Resurrection.I'm not going to write any spoilers about what happens to Laurie, but I think anyone who loves the original Halloween and its characters will think what they did with her in this movie is crap and only put her in here for the sake of having Laurie in it.The characters are plastic. Even by the end of the movie when you get to know all of them a little bit, you don't care enough about them to want to see them escape the wrath of Mike Myers. In fact, you'll probably look forward to their demise at his hands. That's how flat and\/or despicable these characters are. Even the lead role doesn't have much personality. She's nice and smart and decent, just like Laurie was in fact, but somehow she doesn't have much personality. I don't think her character was developed enough, otherwise she could have made a good heroine. The rest of the characters are people you pretty much hope get killed off, especially the tech lady played by Tyra Banks and most of the kids that tour the haunted house. Obnoxious people, hastily made characters. And Busta Rhymes plays the typical black dude with a boisterous personality. Not a bad acting job, but what a typical clich√© character.The technology is another factor. Another case of fusing horror with the fancy gimmick of modern technology (or what was modern in 2002 anyways). Just because we have things like reality shows and phone-texting nowadays does not mean it will make a horror movie any scarier, or realistic, or better at all. Having people emailing and playing on their phones and all in the movie takes away from the good old-fashioned terror you get from something as simple as a lurking shadow or the gleam of a butcher knife.There's a couple of notably cool things in the movie, like when Freddy dresses up like Mike Myers while Mike is there in the flesh and you see two Mikes walking one behind the other. Well that was more funny than anything. The scene with the bong was funny too. And the murder scenes are alright and in typical Mike Myers fashion, but otherwise Resurrection bombs as a horror film and leaves you yet again with no closure, except this time you wouldn't really want to see another sequel.

That did upset me and I think without that it would have got a higher appreciation from me.Nevertheles, an effective piece of work from Phillip Noyce, using atmospherics and sound to entice you into this terror in the middle of nowhere between three characters. It really is dead calm - cuz it's only them in the film there to experience it. ","genre":"Thriller"}]
