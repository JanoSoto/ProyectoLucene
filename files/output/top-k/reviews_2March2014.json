[{"date":"2 March 2014","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" I watched Battlefield Earth today. Um&#x85; yay? If you don't already know, Battlefield Earth is considered the worst movie of all time. When my dad and I recorded it on the DVR I was thinking, Oh boy, this is going to be hilarious. Is it hilarious? Yes. Is it bad? Yes. Is it painful to watch? Oh yeah. Those who haven't seen this movie may be wondering, What's so bad about it? I'm wondering, Where do I even start? How about we start at the plot. It's garbage. Basically, a race of aliens called the Psychlos take over Earth following a nine minute battle (yes, nine minutes). A thousand years later, the last remaining humans become hunter-gatherers. But, the Psychlos come back to use the Earth as a mining facility. Terl, played by John Travolta, is furious for not being allowed to return to his home planet, decides to use the humans to mine gold for himself. But one dude named Jonnie Goodboy Tyler decides to revolt with the other prisoners. Huh. Is it just me, or is that really stupid? Plus, there are really idiotic plot elements that are impossible and hilarious. For example A group of tribal men, who was never even mentioned until halfway into the movie, get into a flight simulator and train to take down the Pyschlos. About an hour later, there going all Star Wars fighter jet on them. How is that even possible? It takes years to learn how to fly, how were they able to master it in one day? There's more, but if I talked about all the mistaken plot elements, it would become really, really long. This movie is also based on Scientology. It's a controversial religion made by L. Ron Hubbard. It is, according to dictionary.com, a belief based on a person being an immortal spiritual being whose survival depends on him\/her and his\/her attainment of brotherhood with others and the universe. Not only is that A, fake, but it's also B, stupid, and C, a horrible excuse for a plot element. I swear, there are so many things wrong with the story of this movie. The acting is really bad, which is kind of sad because some of them are decent actors. Like the main character. Is he a decent actor? Yes. Did he do a good job in this movie? No. No he didn't. But no one, not a single actor could compare to the sheer awfulness of John Travolta. Terl is the most obnoxious, annoying, stupid, douchebag of a character I have ever seen in my life. He thinks humans are stupid, he's the smartest alien ever, and has the gut busting cackle. After watching this movie, I started literally hating John Travolta. When you think of a sci-fi movie, you think of CGI. Yes, Battlefield Earth has it, but it sucks. I've seen B-movies with better special effects than this movie. Everything looks fake, the lasers are copy-paste with a ripple effect when it hits, the explosions lack impact, the scenery is bland, and the flight simulator scenes look like an alpha stage of an FPS game. It just looks bad. The cinematography is some of the worst I've ever seen. It gets way to close to their faces and looks like it's filmed at a sideways angle. Plus the editing is really choppy. There are way to many unnecessary slow motion scenes. I swear, there are at least 70. Plus some lines of dialogue are repeated more than once in an overly dramatic way and some just come out with no sound whatsoever. And the transitions to the next scene are literally the exact same every time! I-it just RRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGHH!!! Speaking of dialogue, that's something else that sucks in this movie. Everything that everyone says is really cheesy. Some of the lines are totally unnecessary too. The most unnecessary come from John Travolta. Everything he says is dumb. Literally. Every. Sentence. Overall, this movie is like a bomb detonating in your stomach. If there's anything redeemable about this movie, it's the soundtrack, which is somewhat decent (I use that term loosely). This is one of those movies that you don't watch because you want to enjoy quality film. You would want to watch this if you're with your friends and you like to make fun of terrible movies. As a B-Movie, it would have been decent because of its humor (yes, the movie is pretty unintentionally funny). As a full fledged movie in theaters with box office numbers, which it is, it is an abomination for the eyes. Do not watch unless you're ready to make fun of it. That's the only way you'll get entertainment out of this piece of crap.

But it's always a matter of which price your willing to pay to get it.This is another forgotten gem that is personally I feel one of Disney's best live action film but also one of my favorite fantasy film's based on a book by an author I really like the late great Ray Bradbury. This was another movie that took place when Disney was still taking chances and this film was another big chance due to how dark it is. Personally I love it if Disney tries again in chance taking, because it's a prime example that shows they can appeal to a wider audience.I really like the story it's a suttle fantasy, almost the kind from The Brother's Grimm where most of the stories are about the extraordinary circumstances would happen to the ordinary. I also feel in a way it's almost kinda a Christian story, since Mr. Dark's scheme is similar to The Devil's. Let alone a theme on Redemption.The production value is good I really like the locale they shot it in, not just capturing a small town but of a time of innocence long gone. I really like Mr. Dark's carnival, it has a aura of mystery as if their could be anything in it or anything could happen. The effects are solid though there aren't that many. My favorite is in the mirror maze sequence, which is kinda similar to the one in Enter the Dragon but I like how made to be a maze of the psyche. Music is also very good a few music tracks are memorable. I even like the suspense in the film, you really do care for the protagonists lives and are in their shoes trying to figure out what's going on before it's too late.I really like the characters and the dynamics they have. The two kids that play Will Holloway and Jim Nightshade are solid and capable actors, it's a shame they didn't do more. But both had a good back and forth, both felt like real kids not some stereotypical annoying ones. Will is a little more wiser and reserved and Jim is little more aggressive but not all the smarter.Even like the villain Mr. Dark played well by Johanthan Pryce whom does well at playing villains, to me this is my favorite one. His roles in Tommarow Never Dies and G.I. Joe Retaliation were more fun villain but Mr. Dark is one that is downright serious. He's is menacing, he seems at times kinda friendly but he can easily turn that around which is part of what makes him a little scary; kinda like anyone that has a violent mood swing. But I like how he's a devil like figure, like the devil he preys on the weak and wounded, tempts them with treasures to entice them only to make them his own.As the narrator Will says, this story is really about his father Charles Holloway (played well by Jason Robards)and in some ways it is. The story on him sort of similar with the movie Bubba Ho Tep just like the character Elvis, Charlies is a man that is in the twilight of his existence. Both him and his son are aware they may not have much time together left and worst of all isn't sure if he's lived life the way he wanted. I really like one movement which was suspenseful but I always feel a spiritual test, when Mr. Dark constantly tempts Charles to give him youth again and rips away pages of a book (which I thought was a good visual effect) as Charles doesn't comply. It was kinda a sad moment as well because it was like Mr. Dark was ripping away pages of Charlies life.There are multiple themes, for the kids it's sort of a coming of age tale, it's not so much about the journey to being an adult but journeying at the right pace. In a way there is sort of contrast parallel between some of the adult characters and the kids. Jim and even Will have a desire for things in his future to happen right now while the adults desire things lost from their past. In a way those adults didn't really grow up, people that pine too much for the past aren't really living in the present or for the future. Both the kids in a way from what they say and how they behave seem more mature, it shows that both of them are the ones that are growing up because despite their desires their not ready for them yet; as an old saying goes all good things come to those who wait.For the adults it's issues on the problem with old age and our constant struggle and desire for more time despite time running out. But also a positive theme on redemption, sure everyone of us might have a regret or two but it's not permanent it's not something we have to live with forever, do whatever it takes for as much time as you have in your life to destroy it. By trying and succeeding at atonement is what makes us truly grow but most importantly live.There truly is a time and place for everything, good and even evil.Rating 4 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"2 March 2014","score":"","review":" There are always things we will need in life, whether it's obtaining a certain object, going someplace, or achieving something we haven't yet achieved yet.

ACO tells the tale of a mischievous, brutal young lad named Alexander de Large, living in a not to soon futuristic London, where society has been cursed by extreme high amounts of crime. Together with his droogs he performs all sorts of violent acts like raping, assault, and then finally murder...When Alex's luck runs out he gets caught for the murder, and is sentenced to 14 years in prison. But after two years he gets a chance to get out of jail, to start afresh and be shore never to return again. All he have to do is a fortnight long treatment...The most wonderful thing about ACO is how different people react to this movie. Some people look and see only a bizarre plot with mad, violent scenes and characters without further meaning, but for those who look behind that and go deeper, they soon find something much more.Apart from the brilliantly stunning music, backgrounds, costumes and cinematography, ACO also is a very complex movie with many interesting philosophical thoughts around the human and its ratio to the world its living in. For example; Alex is seen as a mad psychopath, an individual incapable of fitting in to the different norms and rules of the society, and for that he is put away for other peoples safety, witch is understandable. But then the state comes up with a way to change an individual, to make him into what is seen as a proper ordinary day citizen by conducting an experiment with the subject, in this case Alex.So after the experiment Alex became a changed man, but he also lost something, his free will, he became an individual incapable of thinking or doing something that originally was his nature, to do violent actions. How doe's it end for someone in that state? The question I ask myself, is this right or wrong? Is that how you take care of things in a democracy? When a man ceases to have the capacity of free will, does he also cease to be a man? And aren't the people that commit these actions towards Alex just as bad, or even worse than him?Those are a few of the many questions you ask yourself when you see this movie, and I must confess that before I saw this movie, I never asked myself any of these things. Now they are stuck in my mind.

Some people look and see only a bizarre plot with mad, violent scenes and characters without further meaning, but for those who look behind that and go deeper, they soon find something much more.Apart from the brilliantly stunning music, backgrounds, costumes and cinematography, ACO also is a very complex movie with many interesting philosophical thoughts around the human and its ratio to the world its living in. For example; Alex is seen as a mad psychopath, an individual incapable of fitting in to the different norms and rules of the society, and for that he is put away for other peoples safety, witch is understandable. But then the state comes up with a way to change an individual, to make him into what is seen as a proper ordinary day citizen by conducting an experiment with the subject, in this case Alex.So after the experiment Alex became a changed man, but he also lost something, his free will, he became an individual incapable of thinking or doing something that originally was his nature, to do violent actions. How doe's it end for someone in that state? The question I ask myself, is this right or wrong? Is that how you take care of things in a democracy? When a man ceases to have the capacity of free will, does he also cease to be a man? And aren't the people that commit these actions towards Alex just as bad, or even worse than him?Those are a few of the many questions you ask yourself when you see this movie, and I must confess that before I saw this movie, I never asked myself any of these things. Now they are stuck in my mind.

Nearly everyone who arrives at Wings does so with those two thoughts in mind. Whether it is a great silent film is another matter.To put a fine point on it, Wings is a great technical exercise with a weak and sappy story. It was originally intended to be just a portrait of aviators during the First World War, but then had a romantic subplot grafted onto it. The result is a muddy narrative with characters that don't seem to connect. The aviator story involves two kids from middle America, Jack (Richard Arlen) and David (Charles 'Buddy' Rogers), who are called up to serve their country in the cause, joining the air force to knock the Kaiser out of the skies. They are young and naïve, and dream of glorious romantic adventures. We follow them through their partings with their families, through training and eventually to the combat in the air.As a touch of romance and star power, the studio ordered that a subplot be written for Clara Bow. She was cast &#x96; literally &#x96; as the girl next door. As Mary Preston, she lives next door to David while he pines for another. Wanting to be part of the cause, she goes overseas to work as an ambulance driver. Although her character isn't really central to the movie, Bow gives the film's most spirited performance.As a narrative (at least on the ground) Wings is a mess. The relationship between Mary and David is nearly non-existent. What is there feels forced. The opening establishes that they are good friends while he is blinded by another girl that he is in love with. When he goes off to war, she follows as an ambulance driver. Their second meeting is a long and exhaustive scene in which she catches up with him doing some R&R in a Paris nightclub. There, she finds him so drunk on champagne that he doesn't recognize her (he becomes fixated on imaginary bubbles). Their final scene, as it must, has them realizing that they are in love. There is never really any connection between these two people. She loves him, he loves someone else, they get together. The end. There's no energy or fire to their romance at all.The relationship between David and Jack is actually more substantial. They have a bond of friendship that actually seems genuine and, in another era, might have turned to romance. One is likely to think that because this is the first film on record as having an on screen kiss between two men &#x96; albeit a deathbed scene that, in truth, is more meaningful and more moving than anything that David had with Mary. That part of the film is a chore. The other part, the one in the air, works beautifully. I have always been of the opinion that any movie known for its special effects will fall inevitably to the ravages of time. Technology is a great thing, but at it advances, some movies get left in the dust. Watching the film again recently I was stunned by the coherence of the aerial battle scenes. At all points during the battles in the air, we know where all the players are in relation to one another &#x96; due in part to some very helpful title cards and some brilliant editing. It allows an orientation that creates the drama. We see a pilot in the cockpit with another plane behind him. When a pilot is shot, we can see the plane spinning out of control. That creates the drama, but the movie is even more inventive than that. At one point, an allied soldier is shot down behind enemy lines, sneaks into the German camp and steals an enemy plane. On his way home, he finds himself shot at by one of his comrades who doesn't know that he is an American. That's great drama. It would have been easy to simply create dogfights with no continuity, but to create a story in the air took a further burst of creativity.Perhaps there is something today in our understanding of the First World War that makes a film like Wings seem a little silly. It was made less than a decade after the end of the war at a time when another world war was looming.

Never have I been gripped by such an unbelievably real and emotionally charged performance, as that of Emily Watson, who indeed has mental problems. Not that she isn't surrounded some other great performers, their reputation proved, when seeing them in other films. Oilman, Stellarsgard, nothing like the physics professor from Good Will Hunting, here with long stringy hair, a bit of a flabby body, suffers a fatal mishap that leaves him paralyzed. Unable to perform sexually, he beseeches his love to go out and have random sex and that come back and tell him the juicy details, in depth, that basically gets him off. One scene on a bus, where she made a move on an old Codger, was a riot. I guess that's proving your love. Watson's performance is magnetic, all so authentic, and the hand held shots work well. Stellarsgard is really the only one who gives her leverage or understands her. I really liked his free spirited and determined character, such a reality and natural self about it, where some other times you think he's obnoxious, but it's real. Nell is (Watson) from a strict church background, her mother, harsh, sister (Cartlidge) overprotective.

Such 1950's television shows like Father Knows Best and Leave It to Beaver hit the airwaves and create a generation of its own kind. But as time went on, television soon began to experiment on controversial social subject matter. Television shows like All in the Family, The Jeffersons and St. Elsewhere told American families and households about certain social issues such as rape, AIDS, the Vietnam War, racism and even sexual oppression. However, there was one television show that was clearly flipped upside-down. That show was called Pleasantville.Pleasantville is a film that I was very surprised by because of its ideology toward different time values. In the 1990's, modest, but shy high-school student David (Tobey Maguire) is a fan of the fictional 1950's TV Sitcom, Pleasantville. His sister, Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon), is not a fan of the show and would rather watch a concert on MTV instead. One night, David is hinted that a Pleasantville marathon is coming on in 20 minutes. But, Jennifer wants to watch the concert that she was waiting for on MTV. In the middle of the scuffle, the TV remote control breaks. An strange and old TV repairman, (Don Knotts) stops by and gives David a very awkward, but very special TV remote control. After the TV repair leaves, the fighting continues and as the fighting goes on, the TV remote control transports both David and Jennifer into Pleasantville itself. Instead of being Jennifer and David, they are both children of Pleasantville parents George (William H. Macy) and Betty (Joan Allen). At first, the siblings decide to play along as the Pleasantville children, Bud and Mary Sue. In the dear old town of Pleasantville, everything is calm. Everything is utopia. But, that's about to change. Soon enough, the world of this peaceful town starts to change for the better. First, Jennifer goes on a date with Skip (Paul Walker) and then goes on to make love to him. That, of course, is the introduction to sex in Pleasantville. In another scenario, Bud introduces books to the teens of the town and in another scene, Mr. Johnson (Jeff Daniels), starts to paint provocative paintings, especially one particular painting involving a nude painting of Betty. After social issues starts to take its toll on Pleasantville, the entire town and citizens starts to turn into Technicolor. The community is split up between people who are black and white and those that are Technicolor. The mayor of Pleasantville, (J.T. Walsh, in his final film role), decides to create a Plesantville code of conduct that somewhat mirrors the Civil Rights movement of the 1960's. It seems that the reason why everyone is turning colors is because of emotions. With that being said, Plesantville doesn't have to be pleasant after all.The movie was directed by Gary Ross, who also worked on previous movies like Big and Dave. This is particularly his best work since the two. The interesting ideas that surrounds this movie is the difference in time values between the 1950's and the 1990's. The movie dares us to ask ourselves, What is our values toward different time eras?. It is a big contrast, yes, but it makes total sense on what certain things have to be like in a community like Plesantville. Back then, Mom always had a freshly cooked meatloaf sitting at the dinner table and Dad always coming to a nice clean house. In this time of age, that's not even presentable. Things have changed over the years in our American social history.

Such 1950's television shows like Father Knows Best and Leave It to Beaver hit the airwaves and create a generation of its own kind. But as time went on, television soon began to experiment on controversial social subject matter. Television shows like All in the Family, The Jeffersons and St. Elsewhere told American families and households about certain social issues such as rape, AIDS, the Vietnam War, racism and even sexual oppression. However, there was one television show that was clearly flipped upside-down. That show was called Pleasantville.Pleasantville is a film that I was very surprised by because of its ideology toward different time values. In the 1990's, modest, but shy high-school student David (Tobey Maguire) is a fan of the fictional 1950's TV Sitcom, Pleasantville. His sister, Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon), is not a fan of the show and would rather watch a concert on MTV instead. One night, David is hinted that a Pleasantville marathon is coming on in 20 minutes. But, Jennifer wants to watch the concert that she was waiting for on MTV. In the middle of the scuffle, the TV remote control breaks. An strange and old TV repairman, (Don Knotts) stops by and gives David a very awkward, but very special TV remote control. After the TV repair leaves, the fighting continues and as the fighting goes on, the TV remote control transports both David and Jennifer into Pleasantville itself. Instead of being Jennifer and David, they are both children of Pleasantville parents George (William H. Macy) and Betty (Joan Allen). At first, the siblings decide to play along as the Pleasantville children, Bud and Mary Sue. In the dear old town of Pleasantville, everything is calm. Everything is utopia. But, that's about to change. Soon enough, the world of this peaceful town starts to change for the better. First, Jennifer goes on a date with Skip (Paul Walker) and then goes on to make love to him. That, of course, is the introduction to sex in Pleasantville. In another scenario, Bud introduces books to the teens of the town and in another scene, Mr. Johnson (Jeff Daniels), starts to paint provocative paintings, especially one particular painting involving a nude painting of Betty. After social issues starts to take its toll on Pleasantville, the entire town and citizens starts to turn into Technicolor. The community is split up between people who are black and white and those that are Technicolor. The mayor of Pleasantville, (J.T. Walsh, in his final film role), decides to create a Plesantville code of conduct that somewhat mirrors the Civil Rights movement of the 1960's. It seems that the reason why everyone is turning colors is because of emotions. With that being said, Plesantville doesn't have to be pleasant after all.The movie was directed by Gary Ross, who also worked on previous movies like Big and Dave. This is particularly his best work since the two. The interesting ideas that surrounds this movie is the difference in time values between the 1950's and the 1990's. The movie dares us to ask ourselves, What is our values toward different time eras?. It is a big contrast, yes, but it makes total sense on what certain things have to be like in a community like Plesantville. Back then, Mom always had a freshly cooked meatloaf sitting at the dinner table and Dad always coming to a nice clean house. In this time of age, that's not even presentable.

Mary Tyler Moore, Alan Alda, lily Tomlin (!). Dick van Dyke show, mash, laugh-in. It doesn't get any better than that-- they represent a lost past and seeing them reinvented, and all in one movie, is marvelous.I think the problem many people have with this movie is that they try to identify with one or another character to enter the escapist mode of movie watching and find that identification is impossible. For example, Mary Tyler Moore's comforting presence is quickly vitiated by her shrewish behavior. What is needed to fully enjoy this movie is a lot of ironic distance. Fortunately when I saw this movie, I was studying theater of the absurd, which has as a primary goal the frustration of precisely this escapist mode of movie watching. Movie watching in the escapist mode is like a drug and the typical viewer will scramble around frantically (like a lab rat in a maze) to find the sympathetic character with whom to identify, and to get started enjoying their fix.Needless to say, it didn't take me long to get over my consternation and get with the plan. The aesthetic pleasure of the absurdity, and the complicity of being in on the joke, are far greater pleasures than mere escapism.When I was a kid, I handled situation comedy poorly, (oh no!! How is Genie gonna get out of this scrape this time?). I was enjoying immensely the ironic aspects of this movie but still that ancient voice of anxiety and stress were still somewhat disturbing me during the viewing of this movie.It was quite a relief, then, that we see the faces of Lily and Alan as affable mom and dad, at the threshold of a warm cozy home in New Mexico. All would be well. Not so fast. When once again the plot turned outrageously improbable, I gave a belly laugh and thoroughly surrendered to the absurdity of the wild romp at the end. Out of the frying pan, into the fire. There is no escape!!

Modern cinema has the advantage of words and improved cinematography, effects, etc., that makes it easier and easier to draw the audience into the world that the director envisions. In the case of Charlie Chaplin's The Kid, it has no audible words or flashy effects. It doesn't even have music. For 68 minutes, the film does not make a single sound. And yet, it's ultimately more engaging and entertaining than the majority of films released today. It is a testament to the acting, the directing, and even the cinematography; all doing their part to create an experience that is both wonderfully comedic, and surprisingly emotional. A triumphant achievement.A young woman decides to abandon her baby boy, and leaving him only with a note that simply requests that the person who finds the boy will care and love him. He is discovered by The Tramp (Charlie Chaplin), and after some deliberation, he decides to take the baby in, and names him John. Meanwhile, the woman at the beginning has grown very famous, but she is still reminded of her little boy, whom she misses terribly.The story is very simple, but in this case, less is more. While these plot points and story ideas have been done to death nowadays, The Kid remains an engaging experience. It's remarkable how fresh the film feels, despite its now clichéd story concept. The Kid is truly a timeless picture.As previously mentioned, there is no music in this film (or sound of any kind). A film's musical score is often responsible for setting the tone or mood of the scene. And so, without the advanced cinematography and effects we have today, The Kid should be emotionless in theory. And yet, it is quite the opposite. You will laugh. And you will cry. While the cinematography (while simplistic) and directing are supporting factors in this, the real reason why The Kid manages to succeed emotionally and comically, is due to the acting. There a number of fine performances here. The obvious one is Charlie Chaplin himself as the The Tramp. His comic scenes are nothing short of hilarious, and even his more subtle comedic ideas are chuckle-worthy. And yet, his evident care and love for the child he adopts is very sweet, and gives the character (and performance) layers. The child he adopts, John, is portrayed by Jackie Coogan. Coogan was only 6 years old when he performed in this film, and yet, his performance is nothing less than perfect. Like Chaplin, his comedic bits are very good, but it's really his emotional pieces that sell the performance. His performance would have been noteworthy no matter how old he was, but the fact that he was only 6 is unbelievable. A miracle, even.The Kid is an utter delight from start to finish. Very funny, very poignant, and boasting some fine performances, The Kid is a winner through and through. It gives you the laughs, the tears, and the craft to provide a very satisfying 68 minutes. Absolutely timeless, and an absolute must-see for anyone.

The Kid is truly a timeless picture.As previously mentioned, there is no music in this film (or sound of any kind). A film's musical score is often responsible for setting the tone or mood of the scene. And so, without the advanced cinematography and effects we have today, The Kid should be emotionless in theory. And yet, it is quite the opposite. You will laugh. And you will cry. While the cinematography (while simplistic) and directing are supporting factors in this, the real reason why The Kid manages to succeed emotionally and comically, is due to the acting. There a number of fine performances here. The obvious one is Charlie Chaplin himself as the The Tramp. His comic scenes are nothing short of hilarious, and even his more subtle comedic ideas are chuckle-worthy. And yet, his evident care and love for the child he adopts is very sweet, and gives the character (and performance) layers. The child he adopts, John, is portrayed by Jackie Coogan. Coogan was only 6 years old when he performed in this film, and yet, his performance is nothing less than perfect. Like Chaplin, his comedic bits are very good, but it's really his emotional pieces that sell the performance. His performance would have been noteworthy no matter how old he was, but the fact that he was only 6 is unbelievable. A miracle, even.The Kid is an utter delight from start to finish. Very funny, very poignant, and boasting some fine performances, The Kid is a winner through and through. It gives you the laughs, the tears, and the craft to provide a very satisfying 68 minutes. Absolutely timeless, and an absolute must-see for anyone.

Modern cinema has the advantage of words and improved cinematography, effects, etc., that makes it easier and easier to draw the audience into the world that the director envisions. In the case of Charlie Chaplin's The Kid, it has no audible words or flashy effects. It doesn't even have music. For 68 minutes, the film does not make a single sound. And yet, it's ultimately more engaging and entertaining than the majority of films released today. It is a testament to the acting, the directing, and even the cinematography; all doing their part to create an experience that is both wonderfully comedic, and surprisingly emotional. A triumphant achievement.A young woman decides to abandon her baby boy, and leaving him only with a note that simply requests that the person who finds the boy will care and love him. He is discovered by The Tramp (Charlie Chaplin), and after some deliberation, he decides to take the baby in, and names him John.

The book is a masterpiece but is almost unfilmable, so no matter the quality of the final product any attempt should be given some credit. This Wuthering Heights was a little disappointing, especially compared to the Laurence Olivier and even the 1998(the most faithful adaptation) versions, but it's not best at all, it is better than the 2011 film which was too avant-garde and had the child and adult actors\/counterparts looking and acting nothing like one another. There are things that could have been done better. The main problem is that the story does jump around a bit too much though not quite in an incoherent way, I did wish that some scenes were given more depth and that we got to know the supporting characters more. The ending was bungled, dramatically it underwhelms in how clumsy it is and will leave one infuriated rather than moved. And while what was in the script was good, well-written and brooding some of the famous lines are either omitted or don't have the impact, if it were the opposite there may have been more emotional punch and depth.At its best though, this adaptation of Wuthering Heights is great, especially in five areas. The best thing is definitely Timothy Dalton as Heathcliff, handsome and brooding Dalton has never been more savage or tortured, he never overplays the brutish side of this truly difficult character to pull off and he doesn't underplay the more humane side either. Then there's the music, which is unforgettably melancholic, enough to make you cry often, of all the Wuthering Heights adaptation this gets my personal vote as the one with the best and most effective score. Like the 1998 adaptation, the scenery is enough to take the breath away yet there is a wonderful atmosphere about them too and in an evocative way. The photography is very fluid and allows us to enjoy the atmosphere and scenery, doing this without being too flashy, while the costumes are beautifully realised and true to period, never too over-opulent or drab. And then there is the memorable scene with Heathcliff at Cathy's grave and the luring of Heathcliff by Cathy's ghost, which is incredibly haunting. A shame that what followed didn't work anywhere near as well.The cast are fine on the whole, though Dalton dominates and the only one perhaps who stays long in the memory. Anna Calder Marshall is a fiery and sensitive Cathy and shows some intense and tender chemistry with Dalton. That is not to say she doesn't have some poor moments, her screaming of Heathcliff were even more grating than Sally Field's Don-kee in the 2000 adaptation of David Copperfield. Ian Ogilvy is a gentle and very likable Edgar, if at times a little too on the meek side(not his fault, Edgar is not the strongest of characters in the book either). Julian Glover is appropriately menacing as Hindley, though the Hindley in the 1998 adaptation brought some tragedy and torment to the character which made him somewhat more dimensional. Harry Andrews brings warmth to a kindly character and Judy Cornwell is similarly spot-on as Nellie. The storytelling is uneven, but the atmosphere is very well-done and there are some good scenes like the one mentioned above. The script is a little skimmed-over quality but it's not badly written at all and doesn't disgrace Emily Bronte's prose(much more however could have been done with the famous lines). The direction is far from amateurish too.Overall, far from a bad version but as an adaptation of the book it will be left wanting. It has a lot of good things, some like Dalton, the music and scenery can be classed as great.

A perfect way of showing the difficulty of world peace that not everyone can be convinced for a solution, and act. But the movie isn't only a symbol for the dilemma of war and our modern society ruining nature, it also shows that its hard to judge any creature. What really made this movie stuck with me are the questions I found watching itAren't all the creatures simply races from the same origin striving to survive on earth, is then one side better than the other? And since it's only natural, can you generalize them and their actions as bad?

So those of you who have not watched it please immediately and instantly watch, and those of you who've seen it, can watch again. I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe that the film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and -- believe it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never seen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible.There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel written by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an exposé of true facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for instance, was based on Frank Sinatra's real life, and many of the other characters were modeled after real people. I won't go into that frankly, I have no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra reference seems obviously quite believable.The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.That just advice from me, thank you.

That's not quite the story here, but since comic books play such an important backdrop to the story, I think it's worth mentioning. Director Shyamalan finds a unique way to counter the forces of good and evil in this film, but it's not until the twist ending as it were, that we come to realize that Samuel L. Jackson's character had a hideously disfigured mind to go along with his easily breakable body. I guess there were some clues along the way, like the repeated references to the three particular 'accidents' that Elijah Price kept alluding to, but that by itself wouldn't have been enough to betray his character.I like this story, I like it a lot. From the very outset, the character of David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is revealed through various scenes to be a very believable person. He's the only survivor of a violent train derailment, his marriage is on the brink, his son worships him, and his job as a security officer which doesn't seem like much, turns out to be one where he protects other people. Yet it's his very ordinariness that masks an as yet unseen ability to read others, brought to the fore once Elijah explains that he needs to develop his talent by being around other people.I've thought about the comic book\/super hero angle as it relates to the picture, and I don't know if it was really necessary. Almost certainly, the opening scenes citing comic book collectors is bound to turn off a lot of viewers who will say that comics are for kids and not to be taken seriously. If I were making the film, I probably would have left that out and just started right in with the story. Making the connection later, say when David first visits Elijah's shop, might have been a better way to introduce the super hero concept. I also had to question the unlikely coincidence of Elijah hooking up with David's wife (Robin Wright) as his therapist; it could have been the result of Elijah's secretly checking out David's background, but that was never mentioned specifically.Those few quibbles aside, I think this was a well written and well developed story. For Shyamalan, this picture made two winners in a row following The Sixth Sense of the prior year. Then unfortunately, at least for me, he had three disappointing films with Signs, The Village and Lady in the Water. Of the first two, I think this picture had the better twist at the finale, or at least the one I didn't see coming.
