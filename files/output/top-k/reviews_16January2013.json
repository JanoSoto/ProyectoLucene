Every ten years since then, they continued doing this poll and Citizen Kane had kept on maintaining its #1 spot since 1962. But as we've all heard last year, the outstanding streak of Citizen Kane had been put to an end as another film had taken over the #1 spot in its place. That film is none other than Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 classic, Vertigo. Now, many people are probably curious about my answer to this question is Vertigo really the new Citizen Kane? My personal answer to that question is yes. With all due respect to Citizen Kane, I always thought Vertigo had a more intriguing and complex story, more compelling drama, and is just as artistically accomplished in its cinematography as Citizen Kane. I mentioned in my review of Rear Window that no list such as the Sight & Sound's can change the fact that we all have our own opinion regarding our favorite films. But in regards to this particular development, I think Vertigo being crowned the #1 film on the list is a step in the right direction. In Vertigo, we follow John Scottie Ferguson (James Stewart), a retired detective with a great fear of heights, as famously shown in the opening scene when he's hanging on the edge of a rooftop. Scottie reluctantly agrees to do a case for an old college friend (Tom Helmore). This case requires him to keep an eye on his friend's wife (Kim Novak) who is allegedly possessed to commit suicide. One day on the job, he sees her try to commit suicide by jumping into the San Francisco Bay. Scottie rescues her and takes her to his home to rest and recover. What later results is a relationship that quickly becomes one of the most unique and fascinating love stories ever put on celluloid. I'm going to avoid giving away the big plot twist in the middle of the picture. Just let me tell you that it's not only surprising the first time you see it as it should be. It also adds more drama and complexity to the rest of the picture, including the central romance, as a great plot twist should do. James Stewart once again shows us his unbelievable versatility as an actor. With this role, as well as his work in Rear Window and It's a Wonderful Life, we see the typically charming James Stewart persona with a little dark edge. Stewart is one of the few actors we can connect with no matter how dark certain characters he plays are. Whether he's wishing he was never born, intruding on his neighbor's privacy from a safe distance, or in this case falling in love with someone that reminds him of another person he loves, we somehow can find some aspect about his characters that we can relate to or identify with. Kim Novak is also very good in this film. I forgot to mention that she played two characters in Vertigo and she played them both equally well. The other character she played was another love interest that looks very identical to his other love interest to the point where that reason alone is why she loves her. If it sounds like it's complicated to describe, then it's easier to watch and obtain the connection between the two love interests first-hand since it's a crucial part of the plot twist. I've stated earlier that the film's Technicolor cinematography was artistically accomplished and I stand by that statement. Just like Hitchcock's earlier film To Catch a Thief, the colors really pop out at you, especially with the scenes at the flower shop and the hotel room with the turquoise light. It's not just the colors and the lighting that make the cinematography exquisite. It's also the way that some shots were taken, particularly the ones with the innovative shot known as the dolly zoom. This is basically when the camera is physically moving away from the subject while zooming in on it, which in turn enhances the distance or the height of the subject significantly. The musical score by the great Bernard Herrmann is fantastic. It enhances the mystery, the emotion, the drama and the mood of the story tremendously. It's also very memorable and sticks in your head for the next couple days, weeks, or months as the best musical scores should. Often considered one of Hitchcock's finest works as well as one of the finest films in general and deservedly so, Vertigo stands the test of time and holds up to multiple viewings.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"16 January 2013","score":"","review":" Pauline Parker is a misguided adolescent. She is blinded by the belief that her best buddy Juliet Hulme's family is the ideal one where she belongs. Her foolish ignorance of the love, care and affection given by her own middle-class parents can be especially found when she does not consider the fact that it is her mother who always takes notice of her feeling and tries talking to her, like when Pauline is sad about Juliet contacting tuberculosis or when she is sitting in one corner away from the rest of her family. Pauline's vivid imagination also innocently made Dr. Henry Hulme (Juliet's dad) a hero, when in reality he was a major cause for the separation of the two girls. She may have a wider knowledge and a greater imagination than her mother, but she also was bafflingly stupid and ungrateful for believing her mother was the main enemy in the film.The unfortunate incident of the mother's murder would not have happened at all had Juliet not entered Pauline's life and poisoned it with deluded thoughts about the Fourth World. If Pauline is misguided, Juliet is the main cause for leading her buddy astray. I really don't know how to take the fact that this same Juliet is a best-selling author now, because the movie unflatteringly portrays her as a cankerous albeit intelligent mind who thinks 'scars are romantic'. Pauline meanwhile leads a reclusive life at a school, ashamed of her dark and twisted past and seeking redemption possibly by nurturing school children to be unlike what she had been.The sensational murder case of Honora Parker by her own daughter Pauline and her best friend (and lover probably) Juliet Hulme is brought to screen in a fascinating and unorthodox fashion by auteur director- scriptwriter Peter Jackson. Though not as talked about as cases like Black Dahlia or the Moors Murders, the 1954 murder case is still a very intriguing one for the plain reason that it was hard to fathom that two very intelligent girls could turn into cold-blooded murderers of one's own mother. Also to be considered is the relationship between the two girls who are seemingly lesbians yet it cannot be entirely confirmed as they do not show much attraction towards other girls. The diaries written by Pauline refer to the girls' communion with 'saints' in the Fourth world who are mostly made of actors like Orson Welles, and thus act as a major source material for the film and another reason for raising curiosity about the case. Peter Jackson is not one to keep it straight; much like David Lynch he has his directorial mark etched all over the film. Heavenly Angels does not start with court proceedings, and neither does it show the arrest of the two girls. It lets us enter and experience the 'mental music' of the girls themselves rather than presenting its events informally through banal court sessions. Jackson's transition from Braindead to Heavenly Children and following transition to Lord of the Rings is clearly visible in Heavenly Children, which seems to possess both the stylistic characteristics of the preceding and succeeding films. Not only do the characters give slightly mannered performances that recalls the over- the-top acting in Braindead (such as a scene in the first quarter where Pauline's father holds a fish in his hands and pretends to sing while the record of Mario Lanza plays on), but certain characters also give us impressions of characters from Braindead (especially the timid boarders at Pauline's home who are quite similar to Braindead's male protagonist). On the other hand, Juliet dressed as a princess chasing Pauline, with white horses in the background may recall magical sequences from LOTR series; I may be wrong in saying this since I have not seen the Lord of the Ring series. There are a number of brilliantly choreographed sequences, especially the montage showing Pauline's and Juliet's happy days together, lightened with Mario Lanza's arresting music. Some involve lighthearted humor that nevertheless act as a presage for the girls' worsening behavior, such as the hilarious scene at the hospital where Juliet is approached by a middle-aged man who rambles about Christ and placing faith in Christianity and is ultimately beheaded albeit in Juliet's mind by one of the saints. The most unnerving part is reserved for the end where the characters the camera movements slow down and silence becomes more pronounced, with only a background score playing solemnly as we brace ourselves to watch that dreadful part.Kate Winslet is consistently brilliant in each and every scene; apart from one scene involving the girls discussing about each others' scars where she sounds too crazy, she successfully makes Juliet a highly mentally fragile female whose attachment to her fantasy life and Fourth World acts as a catalyst for the disruption of the lives of the two families. She also excellently plays the brutal murder scene, rightly giving the 'should-we-really-do-this' look to Juliet. But Melanie is the true star here, doing a great job performing the difficult role of Pauline. Not only do her expressions, her lack of eye contact and her defensive sitting posture accurately portray the role she is playing of a socially awkward teenager, but Lyndskey also gives her character Pauline a unique manner of smiling where her nose crinkles up as she smiles. And both actresses play their characters with damn seriousness even during the hallucination sequences, which is a tough job for such a young pair of ladies. Also, Sarah Peirse is terrific in her slightly straightforward role as the mother who is the only one taking an effort to understand what's wrong with her daughter.I unfortunately do not have the unrated version of the movie which is slightly longer but would have nevertheless remained useful because I've read it contains scenes involving Juliet's mother's affair with one of the patients.

'Heavenly' Recommended. ","genre":"Biography, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"16 January 2013","score":"","review":" Pauline Parker is a misguided adolescent. She is blinded by the belief that her best buddy Juliet Hulme's family is the ideal one where she belongs. Her foolish ignorance of the love, care and affection given by her own middle-class parents can be especially found when she does not consider the fact that it is her mother who always takes notice of her feeling and tries talking to her, like when Pauline is sad about Juliet contacting tuberculosis or when she is sitting in one corner away from the rest of her family. Pauline's vivid imagination also innocently made Dr. Henry Hulme (Juliet's dad) a hero, when in reality he was a major cause for the separation of the two girls. She may have a wider knowledge and a greater imagination than her mother, but she also was bafflingly stupid and ungrateful for believing her mother was the main enemy in the film.The unfortunate incident of the mother's murder would not have happened at all had Juliet not entered Pauline's life and poisoned it with deluded thoughts about the Fourth World. If Pauline is misguided, Juliet is the main cause for leading her buddy astray. I really don't know how to take the fact that this same Juliet is a best-selling author now, because the movie unflatteringly portrays her as a cankerous albeit intelligent mind who thinks 'scars are romantic'. Pauline meanwhile leads a reclusive life at a school, ashamed of her dark and twisted past and seeking redemption possibly by nurturing school children to be unlike what she had been.The sensational murder case of Honora Parker by her own daughter Pauline and her best friend (and lover probably) Juliet Hulme is brought to screen in a fascinating and unorthodox fashion by auteur director- scriptwriter Peter Jackson. Though not as talked about as cases like Black Dahlia or the Moors Murders, the 1954 murder case is still a very intriguing one for the plain reason that it was hard to fathom that two very intelligent girls could turn into cold-blooded murderers of one's own mother. Also to be considered is the relationship between the two girls who are seemingly lesbians yet it cannot be entirely confirmed as they do not show much attraction towards other girls. The diaries written by Pauline refer to the girls' communion with 'saints' in the Fourth world who are mostly made of actors like Orson Welles, and thus act as a major source material for the film and another reason for raising curiosity about the case. Peter Jackson is not one to keep it straight; much like David Lynch he has his directorial mark etched all over the film. Heavenly Angels does not start with court proceedings, and neither does it show the arrest of the two girls. It lets us enter and experience the 'mental music' of the girls themselves rather than presenting its events informally through banal court sessions. Jackson's transition from Braindead to Heavenly Children and following transition to Lord of the Rings is clearly visible in Heavenly Children, which seems to possess both the stylistic characteristics of the preceding and succeeding films. Not only do the characters give slightly mannered performances that recalls the over- the-top acting in Braindead (such as a scene in the first quarter where Pauline's father holds a fish in his hands and pretends to sing while the record of Mario Lanza plays on), but certain characters also give us impressions of characters from Braindead (especially the timid boarders at Pauline's home who are quite similar to Braindead's male protagonist). On the other hand, Juliet dressed as a princess chasing Pauline, with white horses in the background may recall magical sequences from LOTR series; I may be wrong in saying this since I have not seen the Lord of the Ring series. There are a number of brilliantly choreographed sequences, especially the montage showing Pauline's and Juliet's happy days together, lightened with Mario Lanza's arresting music. Some involve lighthearted humor that nevertheless act as a presage for the girls' worsening behavior, such as the hilarious scene at the hospital where Juliet is approached by a middle-aged man who rambles about Christ and placing faith in Christianity and is ultimately beheaded albeit in Juliet's mind by one of the saints. The most unnerving part is reserved for the end where the characters the camera movements slow down and silence becomes more pronounced, with only a background score playing solemnly as we brace ourselves to watch that dreadful part.Kate Winslet is consistently brilliant in each and every scene; apart from one scene involving the girls discussing about each others' scars where she sounds too crazy, she successfully makes Juliet a highly mentally fragile female whose attachment to her fantasy life and Fourth World acts as a catalyst for the disruption of the lives of the two families.

The most entertaining part of the film draws on when screenwriters had to get creative masquerading queer characters as straight into their films in order to get them produced.
