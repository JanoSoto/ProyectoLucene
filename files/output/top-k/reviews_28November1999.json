And, finally, a good high school movie.  Well, as a senior in high school, I disagree with both of these comments.  This movie was not entertaining at all, and was a giant waste of my money.  This movie was also, just as far from what high school is really like as any dumb high school movie like Cant Hardly Wait.  Like all other high school films, it has the steriotypical jock, who is very popular, the overachieving nerd, and the strange lesbians. Contrary to popular believe, there are normal people in high school. This movie also failed to be humourous as well as true to life.  It was labeled as a dark comedy, but it was not.  A true and good dark comedy is American Beauty, not this waste of two hours.  High School movies should continue to be like Broderick's Ferris Bueller's Day Off a true classic. The times people laughed in the theatre were truely not funny at all. People cracked up when the principal made an announcement at an assembly telling people to quiet down.  This movie is only funny to people who watch it and say, Ha, I remember when I was in high school, haha. I give this a 1 out of 10, soley because only It's Pat deserves a 0.

Little did they know that they have just unleashed a plague upon both their houses. When the corpse shows up without its head in front of Kappa Delta sorority, Detective Cameron is hot on their tales. Suddenly unexplainable events begin to happen. Corpses begin to walk around, the dead rise from their sleep, and heads explode to reveal a nest of slugs. These creatures are the carriers of this so-called disease and are doing quite a good job of transmitting it. One by one, they consume people, nest and spread. After J.C. becomes one of the victims, Chris and Detective Cameron are determined to stop these little creepy crawlies.This is a awesome horror movie straight from the generation of the genre. Night of the creeps doesn't sport any big names, but its quite well done and is more than entertaining. There is also a bit of very lame foreshadowing that's pretty visible to anyone who has seen the movie more than once.There are few must see scenes and things to look out for when you watch this movie. First off is one of the first scenes of Chris and J.C. in the cryogenics lab. When they see the frozen body Chris asks, Who do you think it is? and in a sarcastic tone J.C. answers back, I don't know, Walt Disney? Who cares. Nobody could've known how funny that line would come to be in today's light. Keep you eye open for detective Cameron who comes armed with a twelve gauge and a myriad of cliches and one-liners in an attempts to be witty. Also watch for the magically self-extinguishing and self-re-lighting flame thrower. And near the end, like when they blow up the house, keep your eyes peeled on the crowd. There is a guy standing in there that looks a little like Bruce Springsteen.Night of the Creeps is time and money well spent. Do what you must to see this movie. Not a bad movie to watch with your girlfriend either, but its worth watching so don't be doing any of that other stuff!

","genre":"Comedy, Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"28 November 1999","score":"","review":"     I always believed that movie critics accentuated too much on the negative aspects of movies.  Therefore I want to acknowledge the good aspects of this movie.  First is Tim Burton's direction.  He is able to create the perfect mood for the movie, frightening and simultaneously ridiculous.  It is beautifully photographed.  The ensemble actors suit the time period so well, they appear to be oil paintings instead of people.  Danny Elfman's beautifully dark and complex score is a perfect match to the action at all times.  However, Depp carries this movie on his charismatic shoulders.  His driven yet cowardly Ichabod Crane is strangely riveting.  Ricci also flashes her acting talent as well as her haunting eyes to create a vulnerable and curious character.  But there are many flaws in this movie.  The plot is interesting, but the dialogue is subpar and the love interest between Katrina and Ichabod has no basis.  We are supposed to believe that they fall in love, Just Because.  Many major plot elements are thrown in simply to create mood, such as the story of Ichabod's mother.  Some other elements are simply unnecessary gore and disturbing material.  I will not even touch upon the total ignorance of Washington Irving's original short story.  Let us say that it was changed enough that if Irving were alive today, they could have skipped out on the royalties.  However this is an above average movie, and has many scary moments.  Bottom Line, it's worth $7.50 if you just want to see a movie, but don't go out of your way.
