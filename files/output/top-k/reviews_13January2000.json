My brother uses an expression whenever he finds something immature or lacking substance  He says it's So High-School.  And this perfectly describes Payne's way of dealing with the goings-on in his Election.Tom Perrota's story is wicked, and Payne is just the sort of moviemaker to bring it to the screen.  The ethics vs morals questions they pose are clever, but they don't echo in your head, because neither is serious about them.  Ethics or morals doesn't fit into a movie that is really about gamesmanship, who stands and who falls, who prevails and who doesn't, and the game is really so trivial, so high-school. That's why the character that really stands out is Paul Metzler (played ingenuously by Chris Klein). He is the only one in the story with any genuine feeling for Carver High and whatever principles it may stand for.  The laughs take on a whole different dimension, when Klein is on camera.  It's as if the smart, hip, cynical people did each other in, and when the smoke rises, all that's left is the tender-hearted jock with dreams of school carnivals, and student-made Haunted Houses dancing in his head.I take exception to the suggestion that all-girls schools are breeding grounds and potential hangouts for young lesbians.  Doesn't anybody go to school in the movies anymore for an education?  Even when I laugh at Tammy Metzler's election speech, the humor feels hollow.  Jessica Campbell has the best female role in Election, but where can you take a shunned gay teenager once she's dumped on a hetero-dominated club like co-ed high school?  Catholic school, of course; where else?As Tracy Flick, the overachiever with faculty in her past, Reese Witherspoon is too pinch-faced to be funny, and Matthew Broderick has aged badly.  He's half-slack-jawed, half-adolescent.  And he plays Jim McAllister broadly.  He's the one that should be pinch-faced and sneaky.  (He was at least sneaky in Ferris Bueller's Day-Off.)  Then we might see that this cold war that's being played out was between two of a kind.  Instead we're meant to hate one and love the other.  And why should that be when you expect a teacher to know better and a conniver like Tracy Flick to be incorrigible anyway?  For odd teenagers in commune, I like TV comedies like Dobie Gillis and Square Pegs more.
