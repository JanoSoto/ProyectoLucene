But I can't condone this trumpeting of a movie which concludes with a shot of the American flag waving in the sun as being a new representation of war.War isn't about nobility. But Saving Private Ryan is. War is about dirt and sweat and blood and tears and futility. It's about dehumanization and loss. There are no men in war who want to reward a Mrs. Ryan with the gift of the only son she's got left. Only men who want to claim strategic posts.Elements of these things sometimes appear in Saving Private Ryan. But they disappear again in favour of a close-up of Tom Hanks' sad-but-surviving facial expression, or an old frail man standing proud at a war grave. Any attempt at reality is then lost.The performances are good - but everyone seems to be tripping over each other to appear the most ordinary. Although this was probably an attempt at allowing the viewer to identify the soldier with the boy-next-door, it ends up sacrificing character depth in favour of surface considerations.All of this is not to say that Saving Private Ryan is awful, and could even be called a step in the right direction. The movie has a good premise and hits some strong notes - especially in the strange conjecture of risking the lives of five men to find one. The problem is, like all war movies to date, it tries to make sense out of what is happening to the people onscreen. Give them a goal, a purpose, and it will seem like the horror that was, was a horror that had to be.The problem is that in doing that, Saving Private Ryan fails to say anything we haven't heard before. It's not that I don't believe good things can happen in war - it's just that I don't believe only good things can happen. And with Saving Private Ryan, cinema failed once again to take that stance.

Richter's THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI is sort of hip, and kind of cool, but really isn't as good as it could be.It certainly starts out well enough. The opening credit graphics, and Music by Michael Boddicker, set a rousing tone for a grand, comic book style adventure.An opening story background crawl, ala Star Wars lets us know about Buckaroo, played by Peter Weller (Robocop), and his mixed background (U.S. father, Japanese mother) his varied interests (neurosurgery, martial arts, particle physics), and the fact that he makes music with his off beat friends, those hard rocking scientists, The Hong Kong Cavaliers.Without wasting time, Director Richter plunges into the action. At the salt flats, team Banzai prepares to launch its rocket car. The problem is, of' Buckaroo is not present and accounted for. That's 'cause multi-talented Buckaroo (Weller) is busy recruiting Jeff Goldblum (Jurassic Park), a top surgeon, who is performing an operation. After asking Goldblum to join his group, Weller inquires, Can you sing? Goldblum responds, A little... I can dance.Soon Weller, dressed in a black, Ninja-style firesuit shows up at the salt flats. When Weller gets in the jet car, the film really takes off, literally and figuratively. When Weller goes off course, it appears he's going to slam right into a mountain. Instead, a blue beam from the jet car zaps the mountain, and then the jet car goes into the mountain. Instead of crashing, it enters a weird 8th dimension. We see a strange landscape, and unusual creatures, some human-like, some not. Soon, Weller and his jet car come out the other side of the mountain, unharmed. In this sequence, Richter and Director of Photography, Fred J. Koenekamp, really delivers the Sci-Fi excitement goods. This is my favorite scene in the film.Unfortunately, the rest of the movie never again reaches this level of fun and entertainment. The rest of the film is a mishmash of aliens, a mad scientist (JohnCliffhanger Lithgow at his most excessive) and a lost soul girl named Penny, played by Ellen Barkin (Sea of Love) in an early, non-impressive performance.The main problems lie with the Screenplay by Earl Mac Rauch. His biggest mistake is that darn jet car sequence. The much acclaimed film Bullitt has its famous chase scene well into the film, which makes it all the more satisfying when it arrives. By contrast, THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI by having it's exciting jet car sequence first, gives filmmaker Richter nowhere to go but down.Another problem is the Hong Kong Cavaliers themselves. Other than Jeff Goldblum, they are a faceless lot, not very well fleshed out, and with little to do. Weller, as Buckaroo, is the whole show, and the rest seem like a Superstar's hangers on perhaps important to him, but not interesting to the viewer.THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI is like a Chinese dinner an hour later you're hungry for a more substantial film. All you remember is the opening jet car scene and the cool music.THE ADVENTURES OF BUCKAROO BANZAI should be watchable for both undemanding Sci-Fi fans and the small fry, who may get a kick out of the aliens.

Possibly the best way to make a low-budget picture was to have the whole set turn dark and let the actors move around in a ridiculously slow pace until the point where something frightening happens. Hold your breath until the conclusion, folks, because that's when Linda Blair actually steals the film on purpose for the last few minutes. Some electronically scary sound effects help create the real feel of being in the dark, though. As a personal commemorative bonus, this is the 10th movie I've seen that shows off mics at the top of my TV screen! Can anyone spot the shadows of actual crew members standing in the way?

This was partially what I expected, mixing the good with the bad. At times, it's chilling. Other times, it isn't. Possibly the best way to make a low-budget picture was to have the whole set turn dark and let the actors move around in a ridiculously slow pace until the point where something frightening happens. Hold your breath until the conclusion, folks, because that's when Linda Blair actually steals the film on purpose for the last few minutes. Some electronically scary sound effects help create the real feel of being in the dark, though.

After all, it is the highest grossing movie of all time (as of the time of this writing). I was left pretty disappointed. That's not saying the movie is without its perks. The special effects are breathtaking. You can tell that lots of time, money, effort, and care were put into creating them. The special effects are about all there is to the movie. The story really isn't too bad, but how many ways can you tell the same story? A rich girl meets a poor boy and fall in love. Her parents disapprove. Not really ground-breaking. The story has been told better many times before. The acting is pretty mediocre. Leonardo is definitely just there for his looks. If they had casted a good, but not as attractive an actor, would the movie have grossed as much as it did? I think not. I know about twenty girls who saw the movie fifty times each to see Leo's face. Kate Winslet isn't as bad, and the remaining actors do fairly well. It's just no surprise this didn't win any awards for acting. Length is also a problem. If the movie were half as long, I'd like it more. The boat sinks for over an hour! It looks good, but it could have easily been cut down. As Kevin Murphy might say, It's like they have two servings of tension and they're stretching it out for seven people. It just strikes me kind of funny that the Best film ever made failed to win academy awards for best actor, actress, supporting actor, supporting actress, OR screenplay. On the whole, there are worse ways to spend your time, but the best film of 1997 should have been won by Good Will Hunting or As Good As it Gets instead of this. I'll give it 5\/10.
