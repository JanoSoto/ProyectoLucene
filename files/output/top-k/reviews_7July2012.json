Dino De Laurentiis' team up with John Gullermin to remake a seminal horror\/action classic has turned it into a new dimension unexplored and well deserved. Be warned, this version holds you firmly in it's palm, and doesn't let go.The performances are what make the film a bit more bearable once you realize that the characters that intend to sail to Kong's domain of ancient evil aren't going there to capture him on film or, capture anything at all. Instead, we're faced with filthy money-grubbing men who care nothing for anything else except the one thing that will score them big money - oil. Although, watching a handful of people trying to make a film with 1930's equipment can get a little irritating and somewhat boring. So, setting it in the modern, like the 1933 original did in it's time, seemed like the right thing to do. Jessica Lange's character, Dwan, does take time getting used to, but her affection for Jeff Bridges' character, Jack Prescott, is the only thing that makes her worth watching.Speaking of which, how does this ditsy Dwan end up sailing across the high-seas with oil harvesters? Well, there's a little twist that ends up making the chemistry between Jack - who turns out to be a stowaway - even more exciting. More to the point of chemistry, Gullermin focuses more on the chemistry between Kong and Dwan. A little too much, perhaps, but through this we see the most fantastic performance out of Jessica Lange. The films climax can be seen as a little ridiculous to the other eye, but is still tear worthy. The bond between Kong and Dwan is more touching than Kong's farewell. Lange proves herself worthy during the films climax, once we hear he scream, 'Don't kill him!! Don't KILL HIM!!' The special effects are quite amazing - Kong has been constructed and performed brilliantly, by the wonderful Rick Baker. The sets are quite a spectacle themselves. The miniatures are probably the most convincing ones that cinema has ever seen. The island sets (whether they truly are sets, they still attract the eye) express more characterized, moody and dark elements than you would normally find in real cultures. Oh, and John Barry's score is simply and utterly, amazing. It gives me chills every single time it's cue is due. Probably the best tracks of the film are 'Full Domain - Beauty is a Beast', and 'Arrival on the Island', 'Sacrifice - Hail to the King' - but all tracks are great and are definitely a real triumph.The atmosphere is probably the thing I love most about this movie. I always love watching it, and looking at the hills in the background, and wondering.. 'What lurks over there?' The thing about this, is that if it was made anywhere else, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much as I did. The island itself is quite a hellish place, in the fact that it's almost like a desert, with shallow jungle. So, you end up wondering, 'How does a forty-five foot two legged gorilla end up living here?' It's a great mystery, that will only lead you watching the film countless times just to find clues. There also isn't much wildlife on Skull Island - just Kong, and a giant snake that he faces in defending his love, Dwan... You then end up wondering, 'Where the heck did the snake came from? Are there more?' People call these plot holes, but I call this the perfect atmosphere that cinema has given in quite some time.

Therefore you could say it's a personal film, but where most of the interest arises is that it stars a pre-stardom (movie-wise at least) American karate champion Chuck Norris. For Lee, Norris wasn't his first choice for the part, but Norris acting bad-ass was nothing more than imposing even though he doesn't make his first appearance until somewhat after the hour mark. The gusty, live-wire iconic battle between the two in Rome's historic Coliseum is simply a marvel, even so the intense lead-up to it. Lee plays country boy Tang Lee who arrives in Rome from Hong Kong to help a family friend whose restaurant is being terrorised by the local Mafia. After getting the better of them in many exchanges, these gangsters won't back down and decide hire outside help in the shape of American karate champion Colt. Way of the Dragon is very rough around the edges, as Lee tries to fuse together his fondness for slapstick amongst the punishing, high-impact kung fu combat. The concise and precise choreography is breath-takingly well-done caught by its showy camera-work, but the comedy is clumsy if charmingly so. The plot is rather simplistic, revenge and nothing more. Although there are awkward moments and some strange sub-plots, but it does offer up a stinging surprise in the back-end. Another humorous thing would be the thugs that Lee finger waves to. Quite a colourful lot with some dramatic acting, but the dubbing makes it sound rather campy. Watch with subtitles instead. Lee is charismatically confident in front of the camera. The choice of setting is interesting and ambitious, but this exotic backdrop adds another layer despite some obvious studio bound sets which did give it a cheap, dingy look.

But for this film, directed by Mick Jackson, did not keep a steady eye on where the plot had to be. Much of the time I was trying to figure out what on earth was happening with the plot that seemed to go on endlessly.The story of the bodyguard is about Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner), a veteran in the art of protection and now only takes care of special VIPs. Sadly, the character of Farmer is so thinly written that nothing ever changes for the better in this man. His entire outlook on his job is strictly to be emotionless. The audience isn't even explained to why the only beverage he drinks is a glass of orange juice.Co-starring Costner is Whitney Huston, a pop culture icon ironically playing a fictional pop culture icon named Rachel Marron. Her character is eccentric and snobby but it works. At least she tries to excite Mr. Farmer, but even she is not able to get him to come out of his cage of cautiousness. It's almost as though the lines written for Huston's character were supposed to be more entertaining than Costner's.The problem with these two characters is that the connection between them just didn't feel or look like it was there. That and the fact that the film focused more on these two people more than the plot. The main plot here was to about Farmer protecting Marron from a psychotic killer whom when, on screen, seemed like he had some serious issues. Turns out though, this creep is hardly ever focused on at all. And it's because of this that the tension in this romantic thriller is lost. Nothing gets tense at all until the finale.The music, which was for the majority of the time provided by Huston, nonetheless has energy but all this does is support the fact that Huston is better at singing. Of course her acting is good but her voice is the top gun that she has. The rest of the score was produced by Alan Silvestri and once again, just like Unlawful Entry (1992), was a let down by the fact that there was not enough music to keep the scenes tight. But then again, who could blame him; how could you produce a score for a thriller film that rarely focuses on the thriller aspect of it?Huston isn't bad at acting here but all this does is prove that she should stick to singing. Not to mention, the lack of balance in romance and thriller makes this film hard to enjoy.

Which is a shame given that it has vitality in abundance, sees the King playing a two dimensional character, features the professional workings of Barbara Stanwyck and Leif Erickson and is beautifully staged and photographed (Lucien Ballard) amongst a Carnival backdrop.Plot sees Presley as night club singer Charlie Rogers who has a big chip on his shoulder, getting into yet another fight he gets fired and via a motorcycle run in with Maggie Morgan (Stanwyck) and Joe Lean (Erickson), ends up working at Maggie's carnival operation while he waits for his bike to be fixed. He has his eyes on Joe's daughter, Cathy (Joan Freeman), but Joe, himself carrying a heavy burden, has a big dislike for the young upstart. With the bank closing in ready to close the struggling carnival, hope may come in the form of Charlie's singing attributes, but will he stay? Will he be lured away by a lucrative offer from a rival Carnie promoter? With Charlie struggling to ingratiate himself to the Carnie way of life, and him constantly failing to show his true emotions to win around a hard to convince Cathy, the odds against him staying seems short.Well how do you think it's going to end? Exactly the way you expect it too of course. But there is great fun and frolics along the way and it is a true spirit raising finale. The clutch of songs are not the best, though the beautiful tenderness of Big Love, Big Heartache and the interesting take on Little Egypt are reason enough to be pleased with the musical contributions.

It is a movie that though somewhat dated still has tremendous relevance today in light of the Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae scandals and recent government bailouts of the auto industry. The film follows young broker Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen), whose aspirations rise above being simply one of the legions of working brokers at a large firm. Wanting instant success and wealth, he tries to Bag the Elephant, and doggedly pursues corporate raider Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) in hopes of landing a big account. His perseverance eventually pays off and Gekko entrusts the young broker with a number of smaller transactions and as he gains his trust begins to tutor him on the ways of the investment world. Fox becomes totally entranced by the wealth and prestige associated with being a Gekko confidant and is gradually lured into the murky world of insider trading.When Gekko presses Fox to surprise him with an investment opportunity, he mentions Blue Star Airlines, a floundering firm for whom his father works and serves as a Union Steward. Blue Star has an over funded pension account, and Fox' loyalty is put to the test when despite assurances to the contrary, the ruthless Gekko decides to buy the airline and break it up, putting his father and thousands of others out of work. Resentful and guilt-ridden at having been used to do Gekko's dirty work, Fox hatches a plan to rectify his mistake and save the airline, but at a tremendous cost.I consider this film to be Douglas' finest work. He perfectly embodies the unseemly cutthroat raider to whom no amount of wealth is enough. His Greed is Good mantra entered the lexicon and perfectly illustrates 80's corporate thinking. Sheen delivers as the young, idealistic upstart who bites off more than he can chew. Fine character work is turned in by Hal Holbrook as a fellow old school broker who stresses doing things patiently and ethically instead of chasing the quick buck. Ditto for Martin Sheen as Bud's honorable working class father and Darryl Hannah as the hot decorator Fox lands with his newly found wealth. Particularly enjoyable is the performance of Terence Stamp as Sir Laurence Wildman, a raider even more powerful than Gekko.Wall Street is entertaining and has a message. Highly recommended film.

It is also one of Lynch's most accessible films - realism and story go first. This highly commendable effort results in a very unusual biopic, following the true story of John (originally Joseph) Merrick, who lived in Victorian England of the 19th century, severely deformed from birth on. The picture steers a highly emotional course. For one it shows Merrick's life as a human curiosity, exhibited and exploited for his abhorrent looks, with his abnormality being celebrated, his helplessness greeted with violence to make the caged animal obey. Degraded to a mere creature, the abuse is physical and mental. But we also get to learn about a person named John, his other side, as one among others, who earns our respect as every human being does, regardless of race, belief, deformity, or any other prejudices. As with similar films where the horror is not merely a fantasy of its creators (take for instance Tod Browning's Freaks), The Elephant Man is serious material one cannot recommend enough to watch, as it will undoubtedly leave an impression. The way the soul of John Merrick is carefully unwrapped is just heartbreakingly executed, helped tremendously of course by the endearing performance of John Hurt. Anthony Hopkins as the doctor who harbors the unfortunate Merrick, fully delivers, as do Hannah Gordon, Sir John Gielgud and Anne Bancroft, who complete the supporting cast.

Walkin's Max Zorin is assisted by titanic model May Day (Grace Jones) who can lift people in the air, throwing them around like rag dolls, and is not afraid to kill for her man when needed. Tanya Roberts is a geologist (!!!) whose father once owned an oil plant Zorin stole from her, fighting him in the courts which has taken practically everything but her mansion. Patrick Macnee has a nice part as a field operative, Sir Godfrey Tibbett, who goes undercover as Bond's chauffeur, both trying to figure out what Zorin plans to do. With locations in Paris and San Francisco primarily, Bond will wind up trying to halt a bomb set in a cave near the San Andreas Fault, hang from a rope dangling from Zorin's blimp, and battle Zorin on the Golden Gate Bridge. Patrick Bauchau's Scarpine is Zorin's right-hand man, as psychopathic as his boss is. When Zorin floods the cave where the workers had been setting the explosives, he and Scarpine machine gun them all who attempt to escape from out of harm's way! Hell, Walken's Zorin laughs while shooting them as pleas of help spray out across the entire cave! Jones makes a sacrifice when Zorin betrays her, Bond gets plenty of action (not just from Walken's cronies, but with the girls, Roberts, Fiona Fullerton (as the foxy Russian agent Pola Ivanova), and even Jones!), and the climax is quite the bonafide stunner (the Golden Gate Bridge, quite a place for the hero and villain to duel, don't you think?). There's plenty of plot centered around the horse track (Zorin's is an aficionado of horses, and his mentor and creator, a Nazi who was performing experiments on women to see if they could perfect a genius race, is using steroids on thoroughbreds) and stuntmen are put to good use as Moore's no spring chicken by this point. I didn't have the least bit of problem with Moore, here, as Never Say Never Again will attest to, an actor can remain in a part a little too long and strain credibility as a chick magnet, particularly when you see him in scenes next to the much younger Roberts.

Once there the actors are locked in with the killer, who dons an owl mask from the costume room and wrecks havoc with various sharp objects. But when one looks at a slasher film the plot isn't important, it isn't why we watch a slasher film, if story is what we are after we would watch The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby or Psycho.StageFright is stylish, fast-paced and gory with a groovy soundtrack and some genuine scares. Soavi seems to take influence from various other Italian horror directors, including Dario Argento, Lucio Fulci and Mario Bava. The setting is used to maximum effect, especially the main stage with its eerie blue lighting and the backstage corridors, dimly lit and claustrophobic. The killer's outfit is very simple, all black but with a giant owl's head, this sounds silly but is actually very creepy, with large glowing eyes it makes for a unique and entirely unforgettable villain.Soavi also knows how to stage some incredible scenes, two of particular note include a character trying to pry a key from underneath the killer and the killer appearing during a rehearsal and being mistaken for an actor, and when told to kill by the director does just that. These scenes are so well crafted it is hard to believe this is Soavi's first film. This being a slasher one would expect gory deaths and this film does not disappoint, with power drills, axes and chainsaws being used to dispatch our cast.The film maintains a serious, dark tone up until the very end in which the director pokes fun at slasher conventions in a rather amusing, if not out of place way.

He's $3,000 short of the $25,000 buy-in, and his quest finds him in an unlikely partnership with like-minded gamblers Annabelle Bransford (Jodie Foster) and Marshall Zane Cooper (James Garner).

It's the kind of TV show adaptation that doesn't require the viewer to have seen the original show.

All that is an immense chain of clichés, of course, an unbearable forced labor chain of clichés if you stick to that and nothing else.But even if this film is full of such clichés, they are so repetitive that they do not mean anything at all in a way. Picasso used to say when you only use one color, blue for instance, and no recognizable shapes at all you just paint that color, hence blue. It is the same thing here and so we have to look beyond that pile of clichés to find the meaning, and the meaning is beautiful.The first meaning is that teenagers who need love just look for that love in the people around them who look at them with care, who speak to them with tenderness, who are able to appeal to their mind, to their desire to be happy and to give and receive love. There is nothing more beautiful than to receive and welcome the love someone else is ready to give you, beyond any other consideration, especially when you are ready to do the same and give love to anyone who wants to receive it.The second meaning is that parents, mothers or fathers are always surprisingly less narrow-minded than teenagers may think they are. In fact teenagers see the world through the bigot eyes of the dominant ideology that is enforced by the bullies who find fun at humiliating other people they consider weak and different, they consider different because most of the time the difference is in the bullies' vociferations and not in their shoes, gloves, shirts and pants.The third meaning is that no one is alone, all alone at any time and in any place. There is always someone who may care for the most rejected and neglected person in the world. Even on a desert island, there is always a coconut tree to speak to you. You just have to listen and if your ears are able to hear you will be able to find your way home, your way to love and probably happiness, even if you have to cross a street or two. Solitude is either an illusion or a disease, but not a disease that is brought by a virus, be it HIV or whatever. A disease that is brought by the nasty trendy tendency of some who are born bullies to reject, isolate and ostracize those that endanger them with their differences.The film is thus a beautiful tale about two teenagers who discover that love in their hearts and that they do not have to fear the world, nor to reject that love. Just take that love which is a blessing and a present from God himself, and remember you love a person with your heart and any other form of love is just a sidekick, a side effect or even a collateral side way to some short term pleasure whereas love is full deep permanent enjoyment because it is the blissful satisfaction of your heart and not of your hormonal glands.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU ","genre":null},{"date":"7 July 2012","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" London, Bermondsey, on the South Bank, popular, even poor here and there, mixed population, and a lot of one parent families and teenagers who do not have the male and female equilibrium they are said to need. All that is an immense chain of clichés, of course, an unbearable forced labor chain of clichés if you stick to that and nothing else.But even if this film is full of such clichés, they are so repetitive that they do not mean anything at all in a way. Picasso used to say when you only use one color, blue for instance, and no recognizable shapes at all you just paint that color, hence blue. It is the same thing here and so we have to look beyond that pile of clichés to find the meaning, and the meaning is beautiful.The first meaning is that teenagers who need love just look for that love in the people around them who look at them with care, who speak to them with tenderness, who are able to appeal to their mind, to their desire to be happy and to give and receive love. There is nothing more beautiful than to receive and welcome the love someone else is ready to give you, beyond any other consideration, especially when you are ready to do the same and give love to anyone who wants to receive it.The second meaning is that parents, mothers or fathers are always surprisingly less narrow-minded than teenagers may think they are. In fact teenagers see the world through the bigot eyes of the dominant ideology that is enforced by the bullies who find fun at humiliating other people they consider weak and different, they consider different because most of the time the difference is in the bullies' vociferations and not in their shoes, gloves, shirts and pants.The third meaning is that no one is alone, all alone at any time and in any place. There is always someone who may care for the most rejected and neglected person in the world. Even on a desert island, there is always a coconut tree to speak to you. You just have to listen and if your ears are able to hear you will be able to find your way home, your way to love and probably happiness, even if you have to cross a street or two.

Spiderman took the spotlight. So I decided to watch this movie. As I watched it I noticed something. It sucks more then Pam Anderson. If you read the comics you would know that spiderman doesn't have the webs shooting out of his skin. Peter parker got bitten by the spider and had every power but that. So he built a machine that shot webs. So other than this movie being accurate it has a few issues. Mainly that it is a lot of talking and not enough action. When I open a movie expecting batman and get spiderman, I at least expect some action. Instead the only real fight was the end with the Green goblin. Even that was boring. you would expect a great ending fight but instead you get half bored to death hoping for the fight to finally end. I finished my night unsatisfied and a little dead on the inside a 2 out of 10 is an acceptable rate for this movie.
