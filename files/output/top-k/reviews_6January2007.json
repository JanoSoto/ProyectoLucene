In fact, I put the blame squarely on him; he clearly doesn't know how to direct actors or tell a story. He is one of the crappiest directors around; an utterly overrated talentless buffoon.

This was a real true to form tear-jerker. Hanks, playing Edgecomb, the guard that you couldn't help but care about, was made outstandingly well, by Tom's work in this one. What a terrific pick, for that role! I just get this different feeling of vulnerability, when I watch The Green Mile, I wasn't familiar with the book as many others were. I just don't think that has any effect on my understanding or coming to better grip with the storyline. I wish that I could go back and see it again, in that movie theater, go back in time (so to speak )because it seemed to speak to me then. About doing for others I think, that was the biggest thought that I can bring away with me. The healer, (Duncan), John was huge and intimidating, yet he was a very important element in Paul's life and his wife's especially. If not for Paul taking the chance, nothing would have changed for Jan most likely. I enjoyed Warden Hal, ( James Cromwell-Babe 1995) his part was just right, the direction and the cinematography was very simply perfect for this prison drama. Delacroix, (Jeter- now deceased) was a great side character, and who can really forget 'Wild Bill' Wharton, (Sam Rockwell) who ed all over the place in there, what a demon that guy was.All that aside though, this was a 'thought-provoking' wonder on film-stock. It leaves you feeling and thinking more than anything else. I recommend highly for those who love a grand story with an incredible ending. Thanks to Director, Frank Darabont.

It's a self-indulgent piece of crap, with its lame film-buff in-jokes and sad attempts to be original and funny by satirizing sequels, films in general, and even itself. Craven and his gang of creators are so concerned with misleading and confusing the viewer as to who the killer may be, that they totally ignore the need for logic, or at least a decent amount of credibility (decent being very little, since this is the slasher genre - the worst horror sub-genre; its ugliest offspring, so-to-speak). I quickly saw through Craven's trick to give all (key) characters motives for being killers, early on (an old, old Agatha Christie tool), and then have them suspect each other. So I tried thinking logically (a mistake, naturally) as to who this boring killer may be; I decided half-way through the film that it must be the black cameraman. Why? Because. No, sorry that would be a WES CRAVEN EXPLANATION. I can do better than that... Here's why the black guy should be the killer1) He would be the first black killer in a slasher film (or?), and this would have been terribly original in Craven's book.2) He was the film's comic-relief (and a very unfunny one, by the way).3) It actually fits in neatly with a couple of scenes in the film.& most importantly4) He has no motive whatsoever.Alas, Craven decides that one of the two killers, the student, has a motive which is ten times more ridiculous than any I have ever witnessed in any film before, and ten times less of a motive than any other character in the film had his motive is his hunger for O.J.-like court-room notoriety and media drama and fame. What does this teach us, that we never knew before? It teaches us that sometimes no motive at all is better than a Wes Craven motive. The absurdity of the other killer, the mother(!) of the murdered killer in the first part, is equally impressive this woman poses as a TV reporter (why??) (idea stolen from Se7en) in the entire film without anyone recognizing her. No one from their small town - and there's half-a-dozen of those idiots hanging around the college and thereabouts - recognized her, apart from Campbell in the final scenes.Then there is the film's finale... If I had any willingness left in me to forgive Craven for some of the many moronisms, it was all but destroyed by this laughable, manic, over-the-top, gab-and-shoot-fest finale which has to be seen to be believed! Horror films and thrillers are infamous and even feared for their awfully dumb endings, but this one surpasses even the most hardened skeptic's expectations. Yes, that's right it's possibly as dumb as Hitcher's ending. Then we have David Arquette's atrocious acting... When will nepotism finally become punishable by electrocution in Hollywood?! This guy, apart from looking like a total loser, is the KING OF ALL OVER-ACTORS and hasn't got a clue what it means to act out a scene and not grimace his way through a scene as though to show the director your latest Beverly Hills facial aerobics exercises. (Craven must have gotten a threesome with the Arquette sisters in return for putting their brother in a major film.)But we have to give Craven some credit, though the service he provided the black culture in America by finally slaughtering blacks in a slasher film, is immeasurable. Hip hop hooray. Craven is an ACLU hero!But the heaviest criticism is not that he is a commercial director, or that he works with lousy scripts, or that the plot is laughable, or that he is self-indulgent... No. It's that he is predictable. This film is in fact just that. There were at least half-a-dozen scenes which were predictable from the moment they began; it was always obvious who'd get killed and who'd escape, and sometimes even how. A sequel will be coming to cinemas near you, as soon as Craven and his gang of idiots think of a way of having even more absurd killers and even dumber motives.Here are a few suggestions for Scream 3 (& 4,5,6...)1) The Killer The great-grandfather of the murdered mother (in Scream 2) of her murdered son (Scream), who lived on Mars and decided to go back to Earth after following the events in the previous two films.His Motives revenge, plus the fact that Martians threatened to kill him if he didn't amuse them by doing something violent on Earth. 2) The Killer The great-great-great-grandfather of the killer in Scream 3, who lived on Jupiter, and decided to go back to Earth after following the events in the previous three films.His Motives revenge, plus the fact that Jupiterians made him do it to prove that an Earthling can amuse them as well as he can amuse the Martians (who are their rivals for rule over that asteroid belt).3) The Killers all the innocent people in the previous four parts. They kill only Neve Campbell, proving once again that Craven can still think of original plots having a dozen people kill one person, instead of the other way around. Isn't it brilliant!?Their Motives jealousy and anger over the fact that while all of them got injured and some even crippled through the series, she got away from all the violence with only minor bruises.The Reason Neve wants to finally get out of the series.

It's a self-indulgent piece of crap, with its lame film-buff in-jokes and sad attempts to be original and funny by satirizing sequels, films in general, and even itself. Craven and his gang of creators are so concerned with misleading and confusing the viewer as to who the killer may be, that they totally ignore the need for logic, or at least a decent amount of credibility (decent being very little, since this is the slasher genre - the worst horror sub-genre; its ugliest offspring, so-to-speak). I quickly saw through Craven's trick to give all (key) characters motives for being killers, early on (an old, old Agatha Christie tool), and then have them suspect each other. So I tried thinking logically (a mistake, naturally) as to who this boring killer may be; I decided half-way through the film that it must be the black cameraman. Why? Because. No, sorry that would be a WES CRAVEN EXPLANATION. I can do better than that... Here's why the black guy should be the killer1) He would be the first black killer in a slasher film (or?), and this would have been terribly original in Craven's book.2) He was the film's comic-relief (and a very unfunny one, by the way).3) It actually fits in neatly with a couple of scenes in the film.& most importantly4) He has no motive whatsoever.Alas, Craven decides that one of the two killers, the student, has a motive which is ten times more ridiculous than any I have ever witnessed in any film before, and ten times less of a motive than any other character in the film had his motive is his hunger for O.J.-like court-room notoriety and media drama and fame. What does this teach us, that we never knew before? It teaches us that sometimes no motive at all is better than a Wes Craven motive. The absurdity of the other killer, the mother(!) of the murdered killer in the first part, is equally impressive this woman poses as a TV reporter (why??) (idea stolen from Se7en) in the entire film without anyone recognizing her. No one from their small town - and there's half-a-dozen of those idiots hanging around the college and thereabouts - recognized her, apart from Campbell in the final scenes.Then there is the film's finale... If I had any willingness left in me to forgive Craven for some of the many moronisms, it was all but destroyed by this laughable, manic, over-the-top, gab-and-shoot-fest finale which has to be seen to be believed! Horror films and thrillers are infamous and even feared for their awfully dumb endings, but this one surpasses even the most hardened skeptic's expectations. Yes, that's right it's possibly as dumb as Hitcher's ending. Then we have David Arquette's atrocious acting... When will nepotism finally become punishable by electrocution in Hollywood?! This guy, apart from looking like a total loser, is the KING OF ALL OVER-ACTORS and hasn't got a clue what it means to act out a scene and not grimace his way through a scene as though to show the director your latest Beverly Hills facial aerobics exercises. (Craven must have gotten a threesome with the Arquette sisters in return for putting their brother in a major film.)But we have to give Craven some credit, though the service he provided the black culture in America by finally slaughtering blacks in a slasher film, is immeasurable. Hip hop hooray. Craven is an ACLU hero!But the heaviest criticism is not that he is a commercial director, or that he works with lousy scripts, or that the plot is laughable, or that he is self-indulgent... No. It's that he is predictable. This film is in fact just that.

The movie is about a single mother, Karen (Catherine Hicks, most popular for her long-running role on the television series 7th Heaven), who has a young son named Andy (Alex Vincent). Andy's birthday is coming up, and he wants a Good Guy doll - an interactive, talking doll that is really popular at the time. Karen is short on money and is working at a department store, but manages to get one of the dolls from a peddler on the streets. Little does she know, the doll has been possessed by the spirit of a recently-killed serial killer, Charles Lee Ray (voiced by Brad Dourif). Soon after Andy has the doll, people who come near it begin to die mysteriously, and Andy says he sees his doll, whom he's named Chucky, come to life. His mother doesn't believe him, but soon enough she will...Probably one of the most original horror movies of the late '80s, Child's Play is a unique and well-done horror\/thriller that is very fun to view. Unlike most slasher films, the villain in this movie is in the form of a possessed doll - and a creepy looking little doll at that. A wise choice by director Tom Holland, the audience never really gets to see Chucky completely in motion for the majority of the film. We mainly see things from the doll's point of view, which is a lot more effective and much creepier than seeing an animatronic doll running around killing people. As the film progresses though, we do see more of Chucky in motion (talking, moving, etc.), but for a good amount of time leading up to that, we see him in his lifeless form, as everyone else seems to see him. And I think his presence is much better because of that.I liked the cast in the film. Nobody performed badly, and Catherine Hicks is a really likable actress. I haven't seen her in much, but she's a good actress and her characters are always very likable (from what I've seen, anyway). Alex Vincent, the young performer playing Andy isn't bad either, and Brad Dourif provides an appropriate voice for the murdering doll. As I've said before, I don't like dolls and I never have. They've always kind of weirded me out. In fact, when I was a young kid (maybe six or seven years old), my mom worked at a video store and the owners of the store received a little promotional Chucky doll when they got Child's Play in, and they displayed it behind a glass window in the office with suction cups. And boy, I remember being literally terrified of that thing! It wasn't until later on when I was older that I finally saw this movie, but that little doll was one of my distinct childhood fears.Bottom line - Child's Play is a really good horror movie with an original plot and some good camera-work (plus a few very creepy moments). Horror fans will definitely want to check this movie out - even though the premise can be looked at as laughable, it's still a very good little scary movie.

I really did not think that this movie was going to be any good. I simply wasn't interested, so I avoided it, for years. Until one night, when I saw it on television, and it seemed wholly different than I thought it would be. I didn't get to finish the movie, so I went and bought it at the video warehouse one Saturday. I watched and from the first scene I remembered, what it was from t.v. it was superbly made.Samuel Gerard, (Jones)has been alerted about a new case. He and his crew are back on line, chasing a different 'Fugitive'. Tommy, for me the first time I remember him, was in JFK. He played the old perverted business man, Clay Shaw, who was also Clay Bertrand. No matter how you can slice him, he always ends up even! Tommy Lee Jones is a believable, authority figure, who seems fair and very balanced. Until he plays a maniac, or something else then he is exactly that, who ever he is put into. I truly enjoyed Wesley Snipes in this tail of 'trailing'. I'm not really too much a Snipes 'Fan' just a hand full of things he has done that I liked, however, he was the perfectly 'pitched' guy for 'U.S Marshals'. With Daniel Roebuck and Joe Pantoliano, on the crew with him, plus Noah Newman,(Tom Wood)who is a great 'Posse' member with Gerard. The funny thing is, I can hardly stand anything that Robert Downy Jr. does. From all the trouble he is constantly into, and the drugs etc. But for this role, he was fantastic, in it. I wouldn't see anyone (too many other actors) doing this character what it needed, quite like Special Agent 'Royce' turned out! The director, did a righteous job of putting these characters in perfect order and exacting development of them. The high-line action that took place was quite a rush!

It was much different back-round-wise than I thought in that it was basically filmed on some sets, but philosophically wise it blew my mind, with so many little, subtle comments on humanity that I was really overwhelmed. There was a lot of imagery, as well as Jane Fonda, to spark some creative, 60's style thinking within me.

The author Jena-Claude Forest, is like a lot of French authors known in America, grant the knowing may be small, in that he has a layered work of fiction that besides having a storyline, like all stories do, has so much philosophy intertwined that it could take a while analyse the movie's different philosophies, views on life, social commentary etc. And even though there wasn't much real-world footage in the movie, it served its purpose as a visually entertaining erotic sci-fi, even though its mild compared to a lot of modern stuff. It has lots of commentary in it, that would be better understood by one who watched it for the visuals. The idea that the old fashioned way is better, is quite humanistic and central to the idea that no matter how technologically advanced humans become, sex will always be there, as an everlasting part of human character.

Pygar seems to be this pure being, (as he is an angel), who was de-masculinated in that he lost the will to fly even though he is still helps Barbarella.

I only acquired the DVD as a memento, so to speak. I had to have at least one movie which had the woman I had a crush on back in the early '60s Yvettte Mimieux. She still looks great, too. The main thing, however, is how I now viewed this story and how much more I wound up liking it than in the past. This was my fourth look at this movie over a 45-year span and I enjoyed it the most this last time. Since time travel stories always fascinate me, my favorite part of the film is when George (Rod Taylor) is actually in his time machine and experiments with it, slowing it down here and then and then stopping it a couple of times to observe World War I and then WWII. Then, he stops in 1966 when supposedly there was a nuclear attack. (Apparently, scare-mongers back in '60 thought that was a short-term likelihood.)Anyway, when George (H.G. Wells, the author of this story) finally stops, in the year 200,000-something, the story loses some of its momentum. However, it's a fairly interesting study of a group of ultra-passive people being dominated by others who live underground and then literally eat the good people. Taylor is astounded that mankind has not progressed as he had figured but seemed to have regressed.The message I got on this last look is that man is still man, meaning sinful and capable of anything bad as well as good, and to put one's faith totally in man is a mistake. It's only going to lead to disappointments as George found out on each of his stops. (Notice he never stopped during a peaceful, progressive period.) Yet, George is still an optimist and wants to be one to help initiate change for the better.

It so vividly evoked a sense of time and place, but spoke its themes universally. It gave us two characters worth caring about and two actors who brought them to life. It's hard to believe the same director was behind this beautiful but vapid film.There are people out there who only care about images - people who argue that, since cinema is essentially a visual medium, we shouldn't care about plot, character and performance. They will love this because all it offers is style. And I must concede that there is some great style here. The kinetic energy of the camera is terrific. Wong's angles are superb and Chris Doyle's cinematography, as always, is spellbinding.But is that really enough? No matter how visually impressive a film is, there must surely come a point when critics stop masturbating over cinematic technique and question whether the film did anything to move them.

I was also intrigued at the fact it was a talkie; my first one, Chaplin-wise.The start is typical Chaplin and blatant proof that when it comes to sound, Chaplain can cut it whilst not solely relying on music to set mood and to do the talking; it's funny, well timed and the elements of slapstick such as falling off an anti-aircraft gun are well tied in with the jokes. It was good to draw the viewer in with this 'classic Chaplin' opening and at the same time, kick start the narrative of characters getting to know one another. What was also well done was the way in which Hitler is spoofed. Any scene involving Hitler or 'Hynkel' in this film, was funny and even now; makes you think back as you know exactly who he's spoofing and does create an internal reaction of some kind. The way in which English in mixed in with the mock German during the dialogue scenes is further proof of the way Chaplin managed to adapt to the talkie era. My favourite joke was the five minute speech Hynkel gave, only for the English translator to translate it into a mere few words; making you think back to footage of Hitler you may have seen giving a speech at some point in your life and, indeed, laugh at him.Historically, the film got a few things right as well. Hynkel is seen getting his photograph taken with children; something Hitler did for recognition as he manipulated the media but here, Hynkel is seen to yawn and act bored; stabbing at Hitler's underhand technique of winning over the German public through sympathy (Oh, he hugs and kisses children. He must be OK!). The film is also given a fantastic premise of a Jewish civilian reinstalled into the ghetto amongst all the travesties going on but with the catch that he is oblivious. Films such as 'The Pianist' and 'Come and See' are two good examples of Nazi cruelty towards 'inferior' people which nowadays, we can all look back on and shake our heads at whereas back in the late 1930's when this was filmed, the fact he had the cruelty going on and was exploiting it makes it even more an astounding achievement. Chaplin has managed to replace guns and truncheons for tomatoes and saucepans and still pulls it off.What I didn't like about the film, however, was the fact it settled into an actual narrative after the opening. This slowed the film up and this is very noticeable as the foot was taken off the gas somewhat. The film started to hint at stories and sub-stories. These included the barber and the female neighbour falling in love and the supposed destruction of Hynkel's palace whereas none of these were actually developed. The 'giving a woman a shave' and the 'whoever has the coin in their pudding does the deed' gags were hinting at these plot paths but in the end, just materialised into nothing but excuses for drawn out, unfunny gags which was disappointing.During the final straight, The Great Dictator gets a boost from the fact the Italian dictator is introduced who adds some much needed life and excuse for comedy to the film. It works a treat as we see them argue and more underhand tactics are exploited when Hynkel attempts to 'overpower' his Italian counterpart through a series of dirty tricks (although, they are humorously foiled). Despite a few weaknesses in pacing during the middle segment and the fact I felt the message at the end was a little forced down my throat, The Great Dictator holds up for viewing today but that's only because he took the gamble of exploiting things nobody else really knew were there.

It was good to draw the viewer in with this 'classic Chaplin' opening and at the same time, kick start the narrative of characters getting to know one another. What was also well done was the way in which Hitler is spoofed. Any scene involving Hitler or 'Hynkel' in this film, was funny and even now; makes you think back as you know exactly who he's spoofing and does create an internal reaction of some kind. The way in which English in mixed in with the mock German during the dialogue scenes is further proof of the way Chaplin managed to adapt to the talkie era. My favourite joke was the five minute speech Hynkel gave, only for the English translator to translate it into a mere few words; making you think back to footage of Hitler you may have seen giving a speech at some point in your life and, indeed, laugh at him.Historically, the film got a few things right as well. Hynkel is seen getting his photograph taken with children; something Hitler did for recognition as he manipulated the media but here, Hynkel is seen to yawn and act bored; stabbing at Hitler's underhand technique of winning over the German public through sympathy (Oh, he hugs and kisses children. He must be OK!). The film is also given a fantastic premise of a Jewish civilian reinstalled into the ghetto amongst all the travesties going on but with the catch that he is oblivious. Films such as 'The Pianist' and 'Come and See' are two good examples of Nazi cruelty towards 'inferior' people which nowadays, we can all look back on and shake our heads at whereas back in the late 1930's when this was filmed, the fact he had the cruelty going on and was exploiting it makes it even more an astounding achievement. Chaplin has managed to replace guns and truncheons for tomatoes and saucepans and still pulls it off.What I didn't like about the film, however, was the fact it settled into an actual narrative after the opening. This slowed the film up and this is very noticeable as the foot was taken off the gas somewhat. The film started to hint at stories and sub-stories. These included the barber and the female neighbour falling in love and the supposed destruction of Hynkel's palace whereas none of these were actually developed. The 'giving a woman a shave' and the 'whoever has the coin in their pudding does the deed' gags were hinting at these plot paths but in the end, just materialised into nothing but excuses for drawn out, unfunny gags which was disappointing.During the final straight, The Great Dictator gets a boost from the fact the Italian dictator is introduced who adds some much needed life and excuse for comedy to the film. It works a treat as we see them argue and more underhand tactics are exploited when Hynkel attempts to 'overpower' his Italian counterpart through a series of dirty tricks (although, they are humorously foiled). Despite a few weaknesses in pacing during the middle segment and the fact I felt the message at the end was a little forced down my throat, The Great Dictator holds up for viewing today but that's only because he took the gamble of exploiting things nobody else really knew were there.

Scorsese knows he has to provide some gruesome violence at some point - we were checking the time of this flick at 1 hour, wondering when it would *ever* be over. I figured then that the violence would be immediate, gratuitous and upcoming - merely because it had to be there, to keep anyone watching. So there it was. A TV-style shoot-out, followed by torture scene (don't worry, I'm not spoiling much) that's filmed with overly artsy and arbitrary camera angles. I've never seen a film that relied so heavily on narration. What was Scorsese thinking? That he'd get remembered for having the most over-narrated film in world history? There are TWO overly wordy narrators, but you can't make up for the lack of cinematic action and believability on the screen - unless you are watching this during a cocktail party or something. Or you really like movies that don't require a strong plot, and blast you occasionally with set decor or violence.The sets are great - that's what kept me going through the movie, but set design and production design do not a great film make. He should have DeNiro be naked to provide interest, though. DeNiro does his obligatory pug-dog face, with the wrinkled forehead way too much, and that bobbing and swaying thing where he crosses his arms and looks intense way too much.The side characters are overwrought and stupidly dressed (that huge bolo turquoise guy is an example). Once again, Scorsese is like a cartoonist that hates cartoons. He can't even put meaningful props around the set, they appear to be symbolic (but apparently are not) and he shows us all kinds of things that never come into play (that's just bad directing - very B movie, actually). I guess I can see how a movie like this one (cartoony) can be popular, though - I just can't handle the shifts in tone and pacing throughout the flick. There are too many scenes where the frame is tilted, comic book style, that have NO comic book content - and where in addition the acting and dialog are overshadowed by set decor or costume - and the dialog\/events do not move the movie forward. Why do that? And why then force so much narration (in a boring tone, mostly from DeNiro) onto the audience?

As I am a huge fan of great Hollywood musicals (e.g. The Sound of Music) I expected that I would fall in love with this movie immediately but I found that I had to watch it twice just to understand it properly. The ending of My Fair Lady confuses me and I find it to be very sudden as if I want it to continue to learn more.Some songs were great in the film and were very easy to get into and enjoy, such as wouldn't it be loverly and I could have danced all night but others were dull and have no point to them at all. At points in the film I want the storyline to hurry up a bit and stop all the songs just simply because they are so utterly boring. This film runs for almost 3 hours which I have nothing against except the fact that it must have a great storyline to keep it going and the audience captivated. In My Fair Lady I felt that some songs slowed down the storyline and without some of the songs the story would have flowed better and made the film shorter. I love the fact that there are songs in the movie (as I said before, I love musicals) but I don't like it when the songs exceed an amount when it just gets boring.Having said all of that, I believe that the acting in this movie is great, especially Rex Harrison as Henry Higgins. He won a best actor Oscar for this role and truly deserved it. I imagine Henry Higgins is a hard character to play and he did a good job.Although Julie Andrews really should have done the role of Eliza Doolittle, we can't change the past and I believe Audrey Hepburn did do quite a good job in the role. The only problem with the dubbing is that sometimes (especially in I could have danced all night) it is not very well synchronized and looks fake. It is truly a shame that the role passed by Julie Andrews as she is a marvelous actor and one of the best singers I have ever heard. I feel that she could have made the film better because she knew the character of Eliza Doolittle a lot better than Audrey simply because of the time that she played her on Broadway and did a fantastic job at it might I add.The supporting cast, Stanley Holloway (Alfred P. Doolittle) who has a perfect accent for his character, Wilfred Hyde-White (Colonel Pickering), the lovely Gladys Cooper (Mrs. Higgins) and Jeremy Brett (Freddy Eynsford-Hill) all add something unique and special to My Fair Lady and help make the film a success.In conclusion, my opinion is that this movie is quite entertaining in parts and has a good storyline but sometimes the songs drag on and on. In general the acting is superb but I still prefer The Sound of Music to this film but I'm glad I saw it. I can understand why it has been such a huge success.Worth seeing if you are a fan of musicals like me.7\/10 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"6 January 2007","score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" I first watched this movie a few days ago for the first time.

I love the fact that there are songs in the movie (as I said before, I love musicals) but I don't like it when the songs exceed an amount when it just gets boring.Having said all of that, I believe that the acting in this movie is great, especially Rex Harrison as Henry Higgins. He won a best actor Oscar for this role and truly deserved it. I imagine Henry Higgins is a hard character to play and he did a good job.Although Julie Andrews really should have done the role of Eliza Doolittle, we can't change the past and I believe Audrey Hepburn did do quite a good job in the role. The only problem with the dubbing is that sometimes (especially in I could have danced all night) it is not very well synchronized and looks fake. It is truly a shame that the role passed by Julie Andrews as she is a marvelous actor and one of the best singers I have ever heard. I feel that she could have made the film better because she knew the character of Eliza Doolittle a lot better than Audrey simply because of the time that she played her on Broadway and did a fantastic job at it might I add.The supporting cast, Stanley Holloway (Alfred P. Doolittle) who has a perfect accent for his character, Wilfred Hyde-White (Colonel Pickering), the lovely Gladys Cooper (Mrs. Higgins) and Jeremy Brett (Freddy Eynsford-Hill) all add something unique and special to My Fair Lady and help make the film a success.In conclusion, my opinion is that this movie is quite entertaining in parts and has a good storyline but sometimes the songs drag on and on. In general the acting is superb but I still prefer The Sound of Music to this film but I'm glad I saw it. I can understand why it has been such a huge success.Worth seeing if you are a fan of musicals like me.7\/10 stars ","genre":"Drama, Family, Musical"},{"date":"6 January 2007","score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" I first watched this movie a few days ago for the first time. As I am a huge fan of great Hollywood musicals (e.g. The Sound of Music) I expected that I would fall in love with this movie immediately but I found that I had to watch it twice just to understand it properly. The ending of My Fair Lady confuses me and I find it to be very sudden as if I want it to continue to learn more.Some songs were great in the film and were very easy to get into and enjoy, such as wouldn't it be loverly and I could have danced all night but others were dull and have no point to them at all. At points in the film I want the storyline to hurry up a bit and stop all the songs just simply because they are so utterly boring.

Although the title character is played artfully by the gorgeous Ashley Judd -- in likely her first movie role, albeit one to be quite proud of -- the emphasis is not upon becoming somebody, a la the next Madonna (whether Jesus' mother or the lurid, attention-hungry singer).It instead emphasizes following ones' instincts and being somewhat introspective about them, to grow into one's ideal, adult self. NOTE This isn't an action movie!!! It uses an occasional voice-over narration (by Ms. Judd) while writing in her journal -- and oh, I see I've just lost the male half of the readers out there. But be patient with this beautiful movie, where we learn that one's bliss can be discovered in -- oh, I dunno, carrying water and chopping wood.Actor\/director\/writer Todd Field, who played Nick Nightingale in Eyes Wide Shut, co-stars as Ruby Lee's noble love interest, one who helps her heal her idea of relationships implanted from youth.But not even his character is the answer for Ruby Lee There's no external hero imposed upon her. The ultimate message is that we are responsible for ourselves. Writer\/director Victor Nunez, who also wrote\/directed Ulee's Gold, did an amazing job showing a young woman growing into herself -- confronting age-old challenges of good v. evil along the way.The supporting cast is also stellar, and the music used, particularly the cuts by chanteuse Sam Phillips (whom I hear is the wife of T. Bone Burnett), is right on -- most especially Trying to Hold on to the Earth. Now, when I hear the first few chords of that song, tears spring to my eyes, Pavlovian and unbidden -- not sure if it's the music, or the indelible connection to the movie's quiet, charming message of empowerment.This movie is highly recommended for any young person trying to find his\/her way. For any woman of any age, it is a must see! The downside It is NOT on DVD, except in Spanish. (We learned, however, that it is legal to make one copy of a VHS version, which can be readily found online. My beloved husband found someone with a VHS copy and got a DVD copy made for me.) Although this treasure of a movie occasionally pops up on-air &#150; on an indie channel, usually &#150; you can't count on that when you might need it most as a tonic to soothe the pressures of the world. So buy a copy for yourself.This movie should have a major re-release, and it would, if I were Queen of Hollywood.-- Figgy Jones ","genre":null},{"date":"6 January 2007","score":"10 out of 16 people found the following review useful","review":" Ruby in Paradise is a beautiful, coming-of-age story about a young woman, Ruby Lee Gissing, escaping her stifling roots to become herself.
