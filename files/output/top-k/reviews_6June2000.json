[{"date":"6 June 2000","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Elizabeth was one of the best movies of 1998. From the first scene to the last this is one of the most memorable movies ever made. Cate Blanchett is astonishing as Queen Elizabeth the first. There are many performances that are considered great, but hers was the best performance given by a woman in a movie released in the 90's. The scene where she talks to the parliament is one of the best of the 1990's. She's smart, she's assertive, she's manipulative and when the scene nearly ends her impassioned plea on behalf of the bill she has sent to them is  extraordinary. Almost every scene with her is worth mentioning.Besides Blanchett's performance there are others that are very good. Fanny Ardant is brilliant as Mary of Guise. The scene where she comes upon the very young injured English soldier is mesmerising. She looks at him with pity and hate at the same time. Her other scene near the end of the movie in which she complains about her nephew evokes the scene in The Godfather where Marlon Brando complains about Sonny. Kathy Burke is stunning as Mary I. The scene with her and Princess Elizabeth (Blanchett) is astounding. Burke is excellent in her role. Both Ardant and Burke deserved oscar nominations for best supporting actress. Both Geoffrey Rush and Richard Attenborough are amazing in their roles as well. I think that Rush should have been nominated for his role in this rather than for Shakespeare in Love. The script was one of the best of 1998. Elizabeth was written by Michael Hirst, a catholic historian! Besides the performances and the script the technical aspects of this movie are phenomenal. The direction by Shekhar Kapur was amazing. He deserved to be nominated for best director, but amazingly wasn't. The costumes were the best of 1998 as was the stunning cinematography. The scene where Elizabeth gets the Queens ring is one of the best looking scenes ever shot. The editing by Jill Bilcock is astounding. Everything about this movie is superlative. It may be one of the best historical dramas ever filmed.

It has been awhile since Fast Eddie Felson seriously picked up a pool cue. The clever hustler takes a young, flashy shooter under his wing. The not well hidden agenda is to get back into the action on the coattails of his young protege. Great sequel. Martin Scorsese's camera work makes shooting pool a form of artistic expression.Paul Newman is in top form in his reprise role of Eddie Felson. Tom Cruise is super as the talented, cocky and fearless Vincent Lauria. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is the alluring girlfriend of Vincent. She partners with Fast Eddie to propel the protege to his finest hour.John Turturro, Bill Cobbs and Helen Shaver also appear. The film grabs a hold and won't let go.
