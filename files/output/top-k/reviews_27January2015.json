There are eight segments, as in the original and The Sorcerer's Apprentice is one of the segments included in Fantasia 2000, in keeping with Walt Disney's original intention to keep subsequent versions of the film some mix of old and new segments. Steve Martin does an overview and seven segments are introduced individually by hosts. The segments are, in orderSymphony No. 5 in C Minor-Beethoven, which features abstract animation resembling bats and butterflies and thus opening this with abstract animation in the same manner as the original.Pines of Rome-Ottorino Respeghi, is introduced by Itzhak Perlman, absolutely beautiful animation of whales moving about during migration.Rhapsody In Blue-Gershwin (Quincy Jones) my favorite segment, with the animation done to resemble the drawings of Al Hirschfeld and with a storyline, the interweaving of the stories of four people over a day in New York City.Piano Concerto 2 In F Major-Shostakovich, (Bette Midler) which is The Steadfast Tin Soldier by Hans Christian Andersen set to music.The Carnival of Animals-Saint-Saens (James Earl Jones) about flamingos and one of them having a yo-yo. It must be seen to be appreciated!The Sorcerer's Apprentice-Paul Dukas (Penn and Teller) the complete segment carried over from the original.Pomp and Circumstance-Elgar (conductor James Levine) the familiar marches paired with animation of Donald Duck trying to help Noah fill the Ark, with help from Daisy Duck, with the expected consequences.Firebird Suite (1919 version)-Stravinsky (Angela Lansbury) probably the most visually impressive segment, absolutely beautiful to look at, it follows a sprite who accidentally awakens a firebird, with disastrous consequences. This final segment actually encapsulates the thematic elements of the last two segments in the original in terms of destruction and salvation.About the only problem I have with this is its length. I would have liked it to be longer than its 74 minutes. Even 90 minutes would have been preferable, though two hours (given that the original was slightly over two hours) would have suited me better. That's a minor quibble. It's a worthy successor.This film is available on DVD and Blu Ray. I've owned it on VHS, DVD and Blu Ray and Blu Ray is the way to go if you have that capability.

A simple tale set in the 50's, a young man is accused of being a Communist and his life is turned upside down. One night he gets slightly drunk and drives his car off a bridge accidentally and ends up almost drowning. He gets washed up on the shores of a small town where he is believed to be a WWII soldier killed years before.This is complete and utter American pie through n through and I mean that in the best way possible. Generally things like this can be quite sickening with all the Stars n Stripes patriotism and this does have that, truth be told this actually has more treacly gooey hanky moments than you can shake a stick at. There is also the element of the all American Communist witch hunts which is the whole plot beneath the surface. Its only kinda touched on really but its played out in a typically heroic way for the main character in the end. You think he will submit to the government, a government of so called democracy, but he fights for truth and justice and the American way. Yes the finale is a bit too vomit inducing for us non Americans. What works for me is the pure visual spectacle of the film with the typically quaint white building built US town set amongst the glorious Californian woodlands on the pacific coast. In short this film looks stunning, its made to look extremely whimsical of course but it works. The era makes this work even better as the sight of old classic US cars cruising around, small diners, the smart fashions, jazz\/big band music etc...give the film a very homely taste that I think anyone (more so adults probably) can enjoy.The cast is another reason to like this film, how can you not enjoy seeing Martin Landau in a brilliantly moving role. I loved 'Ed Wood' and this yet another portrayal of angst and heartbreak but even stronger than before. Gerry Black also gives us a lovely performance for the old caretaker of the Majestic, his gravelly raspy voice draws you in whilst his cheeky grin is heartwarming. James Whitmore has a small role but he sure fits in well, performance is perfect as is his costume and character design, looks good with the pipe. To be honest all the main roles are played well by a host of solid actors, many I have seen before and merely know by face, reliable character actors.Then we have Mr Carrey, to be honest a brave move as before this he was known only for his comedies. This doesn't mean he was the right choice of course, in my opinion he can't quite handle the kind of serious emotion involved here (at least at this period in his career) and you can see it. A case of being type cast for over the top crazy ass characters or idiots, due to this you keep half expecting him to do something or say something daft. Carrey never really looks too comfortable in this film surrounded by proper quality character actors, he was yet to break away from his over acting lunacy.A charming nostalgic film that manages to homage the golden age of small town 50's America and the classic (and much missed) age of big regal looking cinemas, but is also a stirring tribute to the fallen of WWII. It is extremely clichéd and cheesy, love it or hate it I doubt there will be any middle ground here.

How this is not regarded as one of the worst films of all time, let alone as the timeless masterpiece it is widely known as, is bewildering to me.Woody Allen is Alvy Singer, a fictional character, apparently. Let's look at his personality traits Neurotic, self-obsessed, sociopathic, obnoxious, annoying, creepy, perverted... so basically he's Woody Allen. And he's portrayed this same character in every film he's ever made! This isn't acting. This is a documentary about Woody Allen and how awesome and amazing he is.So it begins. The film is basically a series of scenes in which Woody Allen narrates to the camera about himself and why he is the greatest and funniest man alive. In an incredibly uncomfortable scene, a flashback to primary school is shown, the joke being that Woody is his adult self amongst a lot of little girls. Alas, his favourite.In the line for the cinema, Woody overhears a straw man in front of him criticising Fellini. What's that? An opinion that isn't in line with mine? Portraying himself as some sort of hero, Woody calls the man out and then humiliates him in front of everyone. I'm just giving my opinion. says the straw man. Do you have to give it so loud? quips the man who is currently starring in a film all about himself, where he loudly narrates about how he is right about everything. The lack of self awareness is embarrassing.I have no doubt that this exchange is based on a real life encounter where another person politely expressed that they aren't really into Fellini, and Woody just couldn't reconcile with this differing point of view. Whether or not you like Fellini is irrelevant This is a man so childish that he can't stand someone disagreeing with him, a man so childish that he dedicates a major gag in his film to himself humiliating an exaggerated representation of that person. This apparently constitutes humour.You have to look at all these elements, the way Woody Allen behaves and represents himself, and feel a bit worried about the tapestry that is forming. Everything you need to know about the Dylan Farrow case is right on display in his work. Look at his narcissism and his entitlement to having everything he wants, or his uncomfortable fascination with very young women. It looks like a duck, it talks like a duck, it acts like a duck. But when it goes and does something a duck does, apparently it's not fair game to accuse it of being a duck.I turned this film off after fifteen minutes. But in spite of that I feel completely qualified to evaluate the film. When your opening half-act is this offensively terrible, I don't have any obligation to watch any further. Heck, I don't even care if there's a character arc and the film is actually about Woody learning not to be a dick bag. Because even looking past how wholly unlikeable he is in the opening scenes, it just isn't funny or entertaining. Plenty of films take unlikeable characters and put them in stories that make them fascinating. Annie Hall takes the most unlikeable character of all and and beats you over the head with him.

It's a pretty unlikely and totally ridiculous premise, and for me it resulted in a film that wasn't entirely successful.I think the main problem with this film is that it didn't focus on the right areas in order to generate humour; the whole premise of Monty Brewster being able to inherit the $300,000,000 is to spend $30,000,000 without telling anyone about the deal. I personally felt that this film would have been much funnier if that would have been the area where it had focused its attention. It would have been much funnier to see everyone trying to find out why Brewster has to spend so much money so quickly and more focus on Brewster struggling to keep it a secret - it seemed odd that no-one seemed to question where the money had come from? It would have also been a lot funnier if we saw Brewster struggling more to spend his money (he seems to manage to spend the money much more easily than I anticipated). Instead, we have 90 minutes of Brewster throwing his money around, buying everyone and everything and that's pretty much it. It's funny at first, but it's a premise that stretches itself rather thin and starts to become a bit tiresome after a while.Added to this, the film throws in a love triangle that went nowhere and wasn't particularly interesting - this also gave the film a heavy moody feel at times that it simply didn't need. They also had a pointless character who repeated everything that everyone said (thankfully he was only on screen for about 5 minutes, but it was long enough to make me mildly irritated). In many ways, this felt like a complete waste as the idea was a good one for a bit of goofy fun, but unfortunately the writers made it very much a one joke film that failed to exploit other avenues of potential that were most definitely there for the taking.On a positive note, there were some laughs to be found here and there - the funniest scene in the film was probably the scene where Brewster's uncle is reading his terms of the Will to Brewster. Pryor and Candy are both excellent comedy actors and they were both very good here (although I did think that they both 'overacted' at times). There was some good here, but not enough to justify investing 95 minutes of your life watching this. It's a film that I'd only recommend to die hard fans of either Pryor or Candy.

Instead, we have 90 minutes of Brewster throwing his money around, buying everyone and everything and that's pretty much it. It's funny at first, but it's a premise that stretches itself rather thin and starts to become a bit tiresome after a while.Added to this, the film throws in a love triangle that went nowhere and wasn't particularly interesting - this also gave the film a heavy moody feel at times that it simply didn't need. They also had a pointless character who repeated everything that everyone said (thankfully he was only on screen for about 5 minutes, but it was long enough to make me mildly irritated). In many ways, this felt like a complete waste as the idea was a good one for a bit of goofy fun, but unfortunately the writers made it very much a one joke film that failed to exploit other avenues of potential that were most definitely there for the taking.On a positive note, there were some laughs to be found here and there - the funniest scene in the film was probably the scene where Brewster's uncle is reading his terms of the Will to Brewster. Pryor and Candy are both excellent comedy actors and they were both very good here (although I did think that they both 'overacted' at times). There was some good here, but not enough to justify investing 95 minutes of your life watching this. It's a film that I'd only recommend to die hard fans of either Pryor or Candy.

Jackson, Jamie Fox, Jeff Goldblum, Jon Lovitz, Damon Wayans, Peter Berg, Salli Richardson-Whitfield and John Rhys-Davies.Rocky, Raging Bull, Million Dollar Baby, Cinderella Man and The Fighter are some of the most popular boxing films of all time. Punch-Out is a classic video game. All these stories have one thing in common - They all feature a white person as the star, even though in real life the majority of famous boxers are African-American, yet there are no ultra- mainstream-loved movies or video games about black fighters or any other black athlete. That is why The Great White Hype is the most realistic boxing film ever made.After running into some money problems, sports organizer Fred Sultan believes people are tired of watching black boxers compete with other black boxers. Sultan thinks the ideal option to pick in order to restore society's attraction to professional boxing is to produce a white opponent for the African-American undisputed, undefeated heavyweight champion, James The Grim Reaper Roper.Sultan bases his viewpoint on the fact that in 1982 a black boxer named Larry Holmes faced a white boxer named Gerry Cooney and the bout generated millions of dollars and that was because race played a key factor.Since there are no current famous white sportsmen, Sultan thinks white people are desperate for a famous white athlete and that with the right press coverage, he can make a white hero.A little later, Sultan and his staff review various matches on video tapes of different white boxers for consideration. At the conclusion of the inspection, Sultan determines that there are clearly no reliable white contenders with marketable value to compete with Roper.A young woman in Sultan's camp named Bambi suggests that Roper fight whoever once beat him when he was a beginner.Sultan loves the idea and creates a Great White Hope out of an amateur boxer turned eccentric Buddhist rock musician from Ohio named Terry Conklin who once defeated Roper in a novice match. After being offered a big payday and a promise that he will be trained by Johnny Windsor - the best manager in the boxing business - Conklin agrees to return to the ring to take on Roper for the championship in Las Vegas, Nevada on Saint Patrick's Day.The plan work likes a charm. Just like how so many boxing films and video games about fictitious white fighters are popular with white people, Terry Conklin becomes a role-model for white people everywhere. White people order the pay-per-view for the match, buy tickets to see it live and gamble on Conklin to win.While Conklin dedicates his time to training with Windsor, Roper takes it easy, threatening Sultan's thoroughly orchestrated revival.I love this film because I enjoy boxing, Las Vegas, Saint Patrick's Day, novelties, and the cast of this film. I also have nostalgia for mid-1990's entertainment and I find racism to be a fascinating study of human behavior. Finally, I like that this film is ninety minutes. Anything over that is typically too long.The soundtrack has a lot of rap music, so if that's your genre, you're in for a treat.The film is not available on blu-ray. It's only on DVD and there are no special features.If you like films that use bigotry as comedy such as Blazing Saddles, then you will enjoy The Great White Hype.

I really liked the first 'evil dead' and was so excited to watch this sequel, (if you can even call it a sequel), but I was left extremely disappointed. The first film was scary, filled with suspense and plenty of gore. The ending of the first one definitely left the possibility open for a sequel and I couldn't wait. However, Evil Dead II really does not follow on from the first film whatsoever. I won't write any spoilers, but if you watch both films you'll see what I mean about the beginning of Evil Dead II being very confusing given what happened at the end of Evil Dead. The genre is listed as 'comedy, horror'. This is my main gripe with this movie. It is caught between both genres and achieves neither. Firstly, I don't understand why Sam Raimi decided to make this film a 'comedy'. The first film was a genuinely good horror film. Sure, the gore was a little over the top at times and I can see why some would have found it a little amusing, but to actively try to make Evil Dead II funny was a huge mistake in my opinion. There is nothing funny about it and there is nothing scary about it. It's just really cheap looking gore and stupidity. I have to admit I only watched the first 45 minutes because I found it so unbelievably bad. Who knows, maybe it redeems itself entirely in the last half an hour but I highly doubt it. This film has amazing reviews as well... maybe I'm missing something or it's gained a cult following due to its strange attempt at comedy; or maybe its simply because it's an old film and the good reviews are the result of Nostalgia.

It's the classic story of the underdog; it's the story of America - few movies are as inspiring as Rocky. This is not Rocky. It's been a week since I've watched Raging Bull and I'm still feeling depressed. The first act of Raging Bull misleads. People who don't read the description will be 45 minutes into the movie and think they're watching a Rocky-type film, but Raging Bull is less about boxing and more about life. Jake La Motta, played brilliantly by De Niro is the classic boxer-type. He wants money, he wants fame, but more than anything - he wants to be the champion. Unfortunately, he has a fatal flaw - he can't control his temper (like a...a...a RAGING BULL (1980)). This flaw not only destroys his career, but eventually his entire life and Scorsese forces us to watch only the most painful moments.Jake La Motta, frustrated by his boxing ambitions, gets angry about the most trivial things including uncooked steaks and barking dogs. De Niro portrays a man who has no control over himself and cannot tell the difference between the ring and his home, which is why many of the fight scenes (which there are few of) find themselves sandwiched by home conflicts between Jake La Motta and his wife, Vicky La Motta (Cathy Moriarty) and quarrels with Joey (Joe Pesci), Jake's brother. All of Jake's outbursts outside of the ring are because of his career problems. Even some of Jake's outbursts in the ring can be attributed to his insane jealousy towards anyone who ever interacts with his wife.Rocky's fights are fun and iconic, but the few fight scenes of Raging Bull are pure art. I've read that Scorsese wanted the film editing to make the camera seem like a 3rd fighter inside of the ring instead of an onlooker outside of the ropes and it really does have that effect. The camera quickly moves along with Jake, who fights furiously but also elegantly, with very few jump cuts. As mentioned already, there are very few boxing fights for a boxing movie, but that was probably a good decision because it makes them feel so much more important. Jake's fights are extremely violent and are only enhanced by the black and white since you don't get distracted by all the colors the blood and the whirling around of the camera would've created. Besides being visually stunning, the fights are also very loud, almost disturbingly so. The cameras that snap whenever Jake lands a devastating punch almost sound like gunshots. In Jake's more violent fights, the crowd starts sounding like wild animals (like...like...like bulls...RAGING BULL (1980)!). These sounds further emphasize Jake's rage and can be really unsettling, which is why it is probably, again, a very good idea to feature so few fights since a Raging Bull with any more brutality would've been too exhausting.The main focus of the movie is the very unhealthy marriage between Vicky La Motta and Jake La Motta. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci really dominate most of the praise for this movie, but 19-year old Moriarty also gives a powerful performance. The relationship between the two is largely loveless and even the most intimate of the scenes between them are still overshadowed by Jake's violent attitudes. When Jake asks Vicky to come cuddle with him, he lovingly says Come over here... before I give you a beating. In fact, Jake who is initially infatuated by Vicky comes to be very controlling and interrogates her whenever she talks with another man. This relationship largely centered around control is portrayed by Scorsese through his famous use of slow motion and extreme close up shots of the two kissing. The cinematography in this movie is superb and the most beautiful scenes are not the boxing matches, but the ones of Jake watching his wife.Joe Pesci is great in this movie. In a way, you can consider his role as Jake's violent little brother, Joey La Motta, as a preview to his even better performance as Tommy De Vito in another Scorsese film, Goodfellas (1990).The plot of this movie is fairly dull and the career of Jake La Motta, while impressive, does not seem particularly interesting but what Scorsese transforms it into is legendary. This is Scorsese at his most sophisticated. Raging Bull is one of the best movies ever made and by far the best sports movie ever made. Rocky may be the funner of the two, but Raging Bull is a timeless work of art that is a much grander achievement in film making.Who's an animal?

I just watched it again, now twenty-one years after I first saw it in the cinema. There are few movies that can be considered 'timeless' and, although 'Speed' may be an unlikely name to be added to that list, I truly believe it deserves its place among the 'action greats.' Even though it was filmed in the nineties, it looks as good today as it ever did. Okay, so the absence of iphones and Twitter may be noticeable, but it could basically be set today and you wouldn't really notice. The special effects are perfect and blend seamlessly with the action (no dodgy computer generated armies of monsters of far away planets to distract you and pull you out of the moment).Yes, it's definitely an 'action' movie (okay, there's a beautifully-woven romance element in there, but it's not central to the overall story). And, normally when I watch a blatant all out action film, I assume that the &#x96; primary &#x96; audience would be the lads. However, Speed is actually a film that's so good it's probably quite watchable even if you're not really into explosions and car chases.Speed's primary selling point is its simplicity. The story is hardly complicated and yet so original that it's amazing that it's never been done before. A mad bomber places an explosive device on a Los Angeles passenger bus and, if it slows down to less than fifty miles an hour, the bomb detonates.

It's almost never venerated like some of the top-tier works in his oeuvre and while that's not a slight by any means, Cape Fear is hardly among his worst.I, for one, am all praise for De Niro's outstanding portrayal.

Long before the Marvel Cinematic Universe was even planned, they were reliant on other studios adapting their material and usually, they cocked it up. Indeed, so disastrous was their first attempt at a movie (1986's Howard The Duck) that they left it twelve years before having another go - and reduced the character to a brief cameo in the recent Guardians Of The Galaxy. But here, finally, they were on steadier ground. Vampires have long been favoured baddies in movies so it made sense to have a straight-up action movie involving the bloodsuckers. Sure enough, the movie is fairly conventional by todays standards - anyone who has seen any of the Underworld movies will be at home here - but fans of the current crop of Marvel movies might reckon a reboot is in order because this first film in the series hasn't dated well at all.Tax dodging Wesley Snipes plays the titular hero, a half-human, half-vampire hybrid who has dedicated himself to ridding the world of vampires everywhere. Alongside his armourer Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), Blade has a run-in with a vampire named Quinn (Donal Logue) who has attacked a haematologist named Karen (N'Bushe Wright). Rescuing Karen and taking her to his secret base hoping to cure her before she turns, Blade realises that his true enemy is fellow hybrid Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) who has plans to enslave humanity forever.Ignoring the pretty dumb story behind, Blade does a pretty decent job of being a horror-themed action flick. Snipes knows what he's doing in these sort of movies and has all the moves to convince, even if his portrayal is fairly monotone and uncharismatic. In truth, nobody really does themselves any favours with their performances - Wright does an adequate job of being the rabbit-in-the-headlights, caught up in a war she doesn't understand and barely believes. Logue, who I'm currently enjoying in the under-rated TV show Gotham, is little more than a sniggering sidekick while Dorff looks and feels like a weak Jack Nicholson impersonator. It's a pity because the movie generally does a good job, fuelled by frenetic fight scenes and decent visuals. But it's much darker than Marvel's current output (unsurprisingly) as there is a good deal of gore splashing about and some of the characters (like the grotesque archivist (Eric Edwards underneath a tonne of prosthetics) tortured by Blade and Karen) are weirdly reminiscent of the equally dark Spawn.It avoids being a Howard The Duck-shaped turkey but Blade is somewhat underwhelming. I liked the character but wished he had a bit more to him than a back-story and a vast array of interesting weapons (how expensive are those silver bullets, given how many he shoots at a time?). Maybe the sequels will offer something a tad deeper but somehow, I doubt it. Despite the shadows and blood-letting, this is actually a standard shooter that overemphasises the violence instead of letting the characters develop naturally. It looks good on screen and has a good feel for the aesthetics, much like director Stephen Norrington's later adaptation of The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen. But like LXG, it disappoints in terms of story and character although nothing like as bad as LXG did. I wanted to be scared, entertained and interested and in truth, I wasn't any of these. Nice try but needed a lot more to it, especially compared to its stable-mates these days.

But like LXG, it disappoints in terms of story and character although nothing like as bad as LXG did. I wanted to be scared, entertained and interested and in truth, I wasn't any of these. Nice try but needed a lot more to it, especially compared to its stable-mates these days.

Long before the Marvel Cinematic Universe was even planned, they were reliant on other studios adapting their material and usually, they cocked it up. Indeed, so disastrous was their first attempt at a movie (1986's Howard The Duck) that they left it twelve years before having another go - and reduced the character to a brief cameo in the recent Guardians Of The Galaxy. But here, finally, they were on steadier ground. Vampires have long been favoured baddies in movies so it made sense to have a straight-up action movie involving the bloodsuckers. Sure enough, the movie is fairly conventional by todays standards - anyone who has seen any of the Underworld movies will be at home here - but fans of the current crop of Marvel movies might reckon a reboot is in order because this first film in the series hasn't dated well at all.Tax dodging Wesley Snipes plays the titular hero, a half-human, half-vampire hybrid who has dedicated himself to ridding the world of vampires everywhere. Alongside his armourer Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), Blade has a run-in with a vampire named Quinn (Donal Logue) who has attacked a haematologist named Karen (N'Bushe Wright). Rescuing Karen and taking her to his secret base hoping to cure her before she turns, Blade realises that his true enemy is fellow hybrid Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) who has plans to enslave humanity forever.Ignoring the pretty dumb story behind, Blade does a pretty decent job of being a horror-themed action flick. Snipes knows what he's doing in these sort of movies and has all the moves to convince, even if his portrayal is fairly monotone and uncharismatic. In truth, nobody really does themselves any favours with their performances - Wright does an adequate job of being the rabbit-in-the-headlights, caught up in a war she doesn't understand and barely believes. Logue, who I'm currently enjoying in the under-rated TV show Gotham, is little more than a sniggering sidekick while Dorff looks and feels like a weak Jack Nicholson impersonator. It's a pity because the movie generally does a good job, fuelled by frenetic fight scenes and decent visuals. But it's much darker than Marvel's current output (unsurprisingly) as there is a good deal of gore splashing about and some of the characters (like the grotesque archivist (Eric Edwards underneath a tonne of prosthetics) tortured by Blade and Karen) are weirdly reminiscent of the equally dark Spawn.It avoids being a Howard The Duck-shaped turkey but Blade is somewhat underwhelming. I liked the character but wished he had a bit more to him than a back-story and a vast array of interesting weapons (how expensive are those silver bullets, given how many he shoots at a time?). Maybe the sequels will offer something a tad deeper but somehow, I doubt it. Despite the shadows and blood-letting, this is actually a standard shooter that overemphasises the violence instead of letting the characters develop naturally.
