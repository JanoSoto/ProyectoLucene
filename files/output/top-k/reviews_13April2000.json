Yes, it shows kids the upside to school, to science and math, and to following your dreams for what you want to be when you grow up.  But this movie, as anyone who sees it knows, has more than that one storyline.  There is the classic coming-of-age side to it where we see four friends finding out who they are and what they are passionate about.  We see one of them defying his father who seems to be heartless, but who later comes to the rescue of another one of the boys.  And we also see a true life account of one of the most remembered parts of our nation's history--the beginning of the Space Race.  The film opens with Sputnik being launched and seen flying through space over the small town in which the characters live.  From there, one boy gets an idea to build a rocket, and soon his two best friends and their brainy classmate join him.  We follow them through their greatest achievements and their lowest times.  And in the end, we see where their desire to learn and passion for knowledge take them. This movie is an absolute 10 out of 10 for me.  If you haven't seen it, go rent it.

This SUNSET BOULEVARD  approach of the dead man narrating works a treat here as we now know what happens to him, but it's the why and who that intrigues us. The first image of the movie shows his daughter, Jane, on video, wishing his sleazy father was dead. But surely they couldn't give us that much information all in the opening minutes. So we sit there and wait in wonder.To distract us from who is going to do the killing of Lester, we enter via another door with the plaque, Mid-Life Crises. That's the excuse they use when someone in his early forties goes through a radical change in life. A poor title for a poor excuse. What Lester shows us through the pen of script writer, Alan Ball, is that the so-called mid-life crises is the realisation that there is more to life than the game you are playing. This comes through Lester's deteriorating relationship with his wife, Carolyn and daughter Jane. His job is an absolute bore and it seems he won't be able to hold it down any longer. What turns the tables is the meeting of two teenage kids. One is Jane's friend, Angela, the blonde beauty who supplies the rose pedals in Lester's dreams, giving him that extra push to live so he could conquer her. The other is the dope, supplied by the video freak neighbour, Ricky, which relaxes him and allows him to relive those teenage years where loud Seventies music accompanies the cruising of your vehicle.Lets not forget the rest of the Burnham family. We have wife Carolyn, struggling to make something of herself as a Real Estate Agent. She lives in a picture perfect world with a perfect house, a perfect rose garden, perfect car and perfect body with looks to match. But the insides of the mind are rotting away as her failure turns to other options to save her, mainly that of an affair. Daughter Jane is still young and could be spared of this life. She tends to hang back and watch her parents go round the bend. But they soon spill into her territory, where she really doesn't want them. It's the relationship with the neighbour Ricky and his video camera that awakens her.There we have the supposedly dysfunctional middle class American family. Next is the neighbours. What is Suburbia without them? If you are facing the Burnham house, you would find that to their left lives a gay couple and to their right lives the Nazi Colonel, Frank Fitts and family. In the centre is the Burnham family, who would rather stay that way with their political ideology because it's always safe to just sit on the fence.Writer, Alan Ball, has drawn the perfect symbolic structure of life, not only in America but everywhere. This film will be viewed as the RAZOR'S EDGE of the Twenty First century, where humans don't have to travel in search of the meaning to their existence, but only have to look into their own back yard to find it. Lester Burnham does just that and maybe finds it all that little bit too late.First time director, Sam Mendes, makes a proper job out of Ball's script with the help of Conrad L. Hall's photography. But one cannot help and think of the early films of Atom Egoyan when viewing the style and approach, (FAMILY VIEWING, SPEAKING PARTS, CALENDER) . Maybe its because of the relationship between Ricky and the video imagery. Atom's films dealt with the video medium as the main thrust in shaping human lives. There is also the photographic style in the wide shots, that if you freeze them, they become the perfect family portrait. It's only when the images move do we see the ugly side. For a British theatre director to cross over into a Hollywood film,  Mendes did an astounding job in showing us the American psyche.To cap it all off is the performances. Kevin Spacey has a ball as Lester. Annette Bening as Carolyn almost hams it up but never crosses that line of absurdity. Thora Birch as Jane is the only one that keeps the top on her performance, giving her that air of mystery. Mena Suvari as Angela is the perfect wet dream who seems to have come out of one of those bad teenage school campus flics of the Eighties. Peter Gallagher as Buddy Kane, the sleazy Real Estate agent, is very effective in a small role. The mad Colonel Frank Fitts as played by Chris Cooper adds that extra edge, something for the audience to boo at. And last but not least is the brilliant Wes Bentley as the video freak, Ricky Fitts.

The incident became known as the Anita Cobby case and although the killers were caught and convicted, its reverberations still continue in the NSW criminal justice system. This film, from Gordon Graham's play, is not a recounting of the Cobby case, but attempts to answer the question what sort of people could have perpetrated such a crime? The answer given here, in a coldly clinical examination, is a domineering psychopath and his two compliant brothers brought up in a family where the women are treated as mere conveniences.David Wenham, more usually associated with pleasant off-beat characters like Diver Dan in the TV series Sea Change, plays the evil Brett, who has just done time for assault, and is back home manipulating his family and girlfriend. Despite the fact he spends most of his time sitting around drinking beer, everyone is afraid of him. He has the happy knack of being able to inspire fear just by looking at someone and lowering his voice. It is a remarkably powerful performance. Toni Collette as Brett's girlfriend Michelle is able to give us some insight into why an apparently sane (if insecure) woman would want Brett - it's the buzz of his badness that attracts. Being derived from a play, there is drama here, but because the approach is also rather clinical, it does feel a bit like looking at cockroaches through a magnifying lens. It's hard to feel much empathy with Brett - whatever made him what he is, he's pretty nasty and permanent incarceration seems to be the best option.

It's a strange mix of very complex ideas with incredibly simplistic execution.  Unfortunately, racial politics seem to to effect attitudes toward the film as much as they are addressed within it--there seems to be a great need to say good things when there really isn't that much that's good about it.   The first thing I noticed about the movie was the use of stereotypes--they're all here An Italian-American pizza parlor owner, who evidently harbors secret racist feelings while at the same time lusting after a young African-American woman.  A lazy black delivery man (Mookie) who likes money but is more interested in having sex with his girlfriend than being a good worker.  A hard working Korean who owns a convenience store in the bad neighborhood who is distrustful of his patrons.  Add in a thuggish black who blasts Rap everywhere, a yuppie gentrifier,  a racist Italian, brutal cops, Ossie Davis as a drunk, ne'er do wells who seem to roam around the neighborhood with no jobs but lots of time to riot, and a few old guys sitting on the corner doing nothing but complaining.Perhaps the presence of all these stereotypes is supposed to get us to think about them, but unfortunately it tends to undermine the really quality acting by Aiello, Davis, Turturo and a number of others Really top notch performances for characters who don't quite match the talents.  There are sparks of really, really good writing--for instance the scene where Mookie talks to Turturo about the latter's racial attitudes, hilarious and substantive at the same time.  But ultimately, the simplistic stereo types on the one hand -- which, had they come from another director, might be considered racist -- and the appropriate ambiguities of the plot on the other combine to make a sloppy mess of a movie without much direction.  Had Spike Lee waited a little to become more seasoned as a director, such an ambitious project might have been brought off.  He aimed high and so had a long way to fall. Still, the two positive things mentioned Great performances all around with a few really well written scenes are more than you get in some movies.

Neil Jordan has been accused of misogyny and, horror of horrors, making an old-fashioned movie.  What the majority of critics fail to see is the craft and the skill behind this movie - the attention to detail and the paring down of the language until we get a sublime film experience in which the notion of romance becomes an exploration of faith and trust.  These characters do belong to another era; there is no doubt.  Their world is one in which the rules are stringently applied and the price for rebellion is high.  Modern audiences love to wallow in their supposed freedoms, but they fail to acknowledge the battles fought to win them those freedoms. Between 1939 and 1942 a love affair develops between Maurice (Ralph Fiennes in top form) and Sarah (Julianne Moore in even better form).  The blitz serves as a metaphorical backdrop as these two damaged individuals consummate an affair that is lustful but lacking in spirituality.  Sarah is married (Stephen Rea in a sublime piece of acting) and follows no religion ( but turns to Catholicism in a time of need)  and, inexplicably, she breaks off the relationship much to the chagrin of Maurice.  The story does not end there and what follows is a painful examination of trust and faith and betrayal seen from different points-of-view.  Jordan gets his characters to speak through their actions and uses dialogue sparingly.  Just watch Ralph Fiennes shaving and you will pick up what kind of a man he is.  The way he makes love, watch his braces and his clothing.  Watch Julianne Moore's hands, her walk and you will pick up the crisis of faith that this woman must endure in a man's world.  The trademark Jordan touches are there; fairgrounds, lots of rain, tracking shots, flashbacks, jagged editing - all part of a perfect movie experience.  This study of obsessive love, jealousy and contempt is true to the spirit of Graham Greene and a moving, intellectual and ultimately satisfying movie experience.  I have seen it three times and I am still finding new things, new insights and enjoying it every time.

In almost every case, the director lacks the necessary objectivity to identify and excise plot flaws.  In this case they were glaring.Many questions come to mind.  Why was Cole (Haley Joel Osment) afraid of every ghost but Malcolm (Bruce Willis)?  Why did every ghost appear in a form that showed how they died except Malcolm?  They were all bloody and disfigured; why not Malcolm?  Where was the bullet hole in his shirt and the blood?  I watched the movie a second time and there were a number of scenes where he had no jacket.  He always wore the same shirt, but there was no bullet hole or blood in any scene.Clearly the biggest question is why it was never cold when Malcolm was in the room except in the very last scene with his wife (Olivia Williams).  He was in scenes with Cole's mother (Toni Collette), a restaurant full of people, a theater full of parents, a doctor, and on and on and yet in no scene did anyone seem remotely chilly, no less seeing their breath.So, I have a fundamental problem calling this a great motion picture.  However, it was very well filmed from a technical standpoint and produced some excellent suspense throughout that kept the viewer engaged.The acting was fair to excellent.  Toni Collette was mediocre at best as Cole's mother.  She overacted in almost every scene and her chemistry wasn't very good with the boy until the last scene when he told her what her mother said.  Likewise, Olivia Williams didn't bowl me over as Malcolm's wife.Bruce Willis gave a good performance, but he is out of his element playing the sensitive and self doubting type.  He always comes across as a bit whiny when he tries to play nice guy parts.  His forte is playing the tough, strong courageous type and he would best serve his career by staying with those types of parts.Finally, there is young Haley Joel Osment as Cole.  He gave an excellent performance and was the linchpin that held the whole film together.  He was very versatile in his portrayal of various emotions.  He handled fear, playfulness, affection and anger with equal aplomb.  His physiognomy was right for the part as well, as he looked very nerdy and self conscious, exactly what was needed for the part.I rated this film a 7\/10.

IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED YOU SEE THE FILM BEFORE READING THIS COMMENT.It seems most people fall into one of two camps on this film.  They either love it or hate it (it would seem that more love it).  My sentiments lie with neither camp.  This is a fascinating and clever story that is well filmed but poorly crafted.  Plot holes abound and Director\/Writer M. Night Shyamalan has to fudge all over the place to keep the surprise ending a surprise.  In my comments here, I have commented many times on the dangers of writers directing their own work.  In almost every case, the director lacks the necessary objectivity to identify and excise plot flaws.  In this case they were glaring.Many questions come to mind.  Why was Cole (Haley Joel Osment) afraid of every ghost but Malcolm (Bruce Willis)?  Why did every ghost appear in a form that showed how they died except Malcolm?  They were all bloody and disfigured; why not Malcolm?  Where was the bullet hole in his shirt and the blood?  I watched the movie a second time and there were a number of scenes where he had no jacket.  He always wore the same shirt, but there was no bullet hole or blood in any scene.Clearly the biggest question is why it was never cold when Malcolm was in the room except in the very last scene with his wife (Olivia Williams).  He was in scenes with Cole's mother (Toni Collette), a restaurant full of people, a theater full of parents, a doctor, and on and on and yet in no scene did anyone seem remotely chilly, no less seeing their breath.So, I have a fundamental problem calling this a great motion picture.  However, it was very well filmed from a technical standpoint and produced some excellent suspense throughout that kept the viewer engaged.The acting was fair to excellent.  Toni Collette was mediocre at best as Cole's mother.  She overacted in almost every scene and her chemistry wasn't very good with the boy until the last scene when he told her what her mother said.  Likewise, Olivia Williams didn't bowl me over as Malcolm's wife.Bruce Willis gave a good performance, but he is out of his element playing the sensitive and self doubting type.  He always comes across as a bit whiny when he tries to play nice guy parts.  His forte is playing the tough, strong courageous type and he would best serve his career by staying with those types of parts.Finally, there is young Haley Joel Osment as Cole.  He gave an excellent performance and was the linchpin that held the whole film together.  He was very versatile in his portrayal of various emotions.  He handled fear, playfulness, affection and anger with equal aplomb.  His physiognomy was right for the part as well, as he looked very nerdy and self conscious, exactly what was needed for the part.I rated this film a 7\/10.  It was entertaining and it had real potential, but it had too many flaws to realize it.

It was also the first film of J.C. which he did for a big studio and on a rather large budget. Contrary to other films Carpenter was given much more time to complete this masterpiece. What he achieved has since become a true classic in the horror genre even if it is quite different from most of the other films that were made in the 80s.The Thing is not just a normal horror film trying to scare the audience with cheap thrills but is also some kind of a psychological drama. Throughout the whole movie you can never be sure who to trust. The thing moves from body to body imitating the victims perfectly and that's why anybody among the men could be possessed. The theme of paranoia and mistrust is very strong in this film and cleverly done.The Thing is set in the Antarctic (in fact it was shot in British Columbia). It is made clear to the viewer that there is no possibility of escape for any of the members of the research crew. The location also creates a feeling of loneliness and isolation where each one of the dozen men is basically on his own and therefore contributes to the paranoid undertone.And of course the film has state-of-the-art special effects and lighting. Rob Bottin simply did a great job. There is lots of gore and some very inventive scenes were the thing changes its shape. Some of the effects had to be done several times and others were deleted because Carpenter and Bottin didn't want the effects to be laughable or cheesy. The effects are outstanding and astonishing even for today's standards. They are much more interesting to look at than modern computer-animated special effects.But the most important thing that made this film believable are the actors (it is a male-only film by the way). Each and everyone of the cast was convincing which is a rare thing. Although there are twelve or so men in this film who are almost equally important (with Kurt Russell becoming some kind of a leader) Carpenter managed to give each one of them an own character in a very short time. He didn't even need to include much dialogue to make the persons seem real.I recommend this film to anyone who is interested in Carpenter's work and\/or horror films and doesn't have a weak stomach.My rating 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 April 2000","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  The Thing is Carpenter's best work right after Halloween (which is almost impossible to surpass).

Like AMERICAN PIE, SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, & SOUTH PARK, the jokes in the film are gross and crude, but they do manage to keep one laughing and never resort to the routine potty jokes like many films do.      ROAD TRIP is about a young couple who have been boyfriend and girlfriend for a very long time.  The boy, Josh (Breckin Meyer) is attending college in New York, while the girl, Tiffany, is going to college in Austin, Texas.  Josh keeps in touch with Tiffany by sending her video mail, with messages and songs on how much he loves her.  One weekend, when Tiffany didn't respond back, Josh has a passionate evening with Beth (Amy Smart) one of his classmates, and Josh has this eveningvideo taped.  When Josh's friends want to see this video, Josh discovers that the wrong tape got sent to Tiffany!  Now Josh has three days and 1800 miles to travel to intercept that video from Tiffany.        Going along with Josh is his drug influenced roommate (Paulo Costanzo), his sex obsessed and egoistical friend (Seann William Scott) and the only guy who has a car and money (DJ Qualls).

I am not much into science fiction but I bought the tape because it was recommended by a bunch of Christian friends. The movie is fine, but I found that the movies such as The Sixth Sense also have a religious side to them as the boy seeks peace and shelter in a church. There is definitely a struggle between good and evil, but everyone is dead already.  In The Sixth Sense nobody gets that there is no big mystery about the movie except that they are all dead and are talking. Does the dead talk? The Bible indicates that they do. Look at Lazarus.

This type language sounds really Messianic. I guess one could watch the movie from that perspective. Perhaps it should be fun to have a discussion on the topic of the Christian message in The Matrix. We will have to wait until the sequel to see if that was indeed a much larger Messianic side to the story.  I am not sure! Just watch and make your own analysis now and of any future Matrix.

Obviously no human can do that without some type of super power. But I don't think that it would be fair to compare her to the Trinity known by Christians. Favorite Quotes Trinity  You're looking for him. I know because I was once looking for the same thing. And when he found me, he told me I wasn't really looking for him. I was  looking for an answer. It's the question that drives us. It's the question that brought you here.  Morpheus I'm trying to free your mind, Neo. But I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it. This type language sounds really Messianic. I guess one could watch the movie from that perspective. Perhaps it should be fun to have a discussion on the topic of the Christian message in The Matrix. We will have to wait until the sequel to see if that was indeed a much larger Messianic side to the story.  I am not sure! Just watch and make your own analysis now and of any future Matrix. Actually I could argue both sides of the issue.

However, this film is more than that it is a story of ghosts, of fathers and sons, and reconnecting hopes and dreams together.Kevin Costner, is a terrific and wholly believable performance, plays Ray Kinsella, a former hippie and current Iowa farmer, living with his wife, Annie (Amy Madigan) and daughter Karen (Gaby Hoffmann).  As he walks through his cornfields one day, he hears a voice that says to him `If you build it, he will come.'  Costner interprets this message to mean that he should build a baseball field in the middle of his farm, even though it would mean a terrible financial loss.  From there, the story takes twists and turns involving the writer Terrence Mann (James Earl Jones), the great, but shamed baseball star Shoeless Joe Jackson (Ray Liotta), and others.Most of all, though, this film is about second chances. Without giving away too much, it should be said that Phil Alden Robinson, who both brilliantly wrote and directed this film, manages to takes the very best emotions from the game and merge them with the importance of family, redemption, and even magic.

What is it really? There's more water than everything else in our world. Do you really think we know what's in there... in those deep waters.The director of the excellent The Mummy has probably made the most slick and entertaining creature movie this far. Deep Rising is so incredibly underrated. I really think this one should be there in the top... together with Carpenters The Thing and Camerons Aliens.I think this special ocean is really frightening. In one scene Famke Janssens character goes out on deck and looks out into the dark night... and in the background we hear the creatures roar. Scenes like that gives me a sense of, something I use to call, a clear cold. I don't expect you to understand, but I have the same feeling in movies like Deep Blue Sea (when Skarsgard is pushed by the shark) and especially in 2001 A Space Odyssey. Even if that movie takes place in space... there's is that feeling of an empty helplessness... a clear cold so to say.But don't think Deep Rising is like 2001. No... this is a highly effective action\/adventure where a great looking and really quick creature appears and gives the hero and his crew a really hard time. Treat Williams is good and the beautiful Famke Janssen does one of her best performances. I really like her character. Everything about this movie is cool and so very entertaining. The ending is really funny and I would love to see a sequel on the new-found island. Great director Sommers went on to make The Mummy, which sometimes is very similar to this one. He has the touch of style and knows how to entertain an audience. I look forward to Mummy 2.If you love monster-movies, you have to see this one. I don't think you will be disappointed. Have fun!

I have also known many people like Margaret (Parker Posey) - people who need to be seen and heard at all times. And this one of Parker's greatest performances. She goes from a bouncy free-spirit to an aggressive troublemaker to an outcast without warning, and her transformation is fascinating to watch. Lisa Kudrow, too, gives another great performance (and this was before her scene-stealing role in The Opposite of Sex) as the possibly compulsive liar Paula. The fourth actress, Alannah Ubach, I have not seen in anything else, but she is absolutely a delight to watch. Smaller roles by actors such as Jamie Kennedy, Bob Balaban (Posey's costar in Waiting For Guffman), and David James Elliot are also performed with perfection.
