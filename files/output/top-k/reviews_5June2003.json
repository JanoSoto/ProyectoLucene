Then, Uber M. gives him back his time machine and pocketwatch that he took earlier on in the movie and sends him on his merry way. Pretty-Boy, upon realizing that he is, in fact, a dumbass, attacks Uber M., kills him, and completely destroys the entire eco-system, which he goes forward in time to witness.

And while I'll probably be crucified or burned at the stake for saying it, I certainly don't see what all the hubbub is about! I come from a pretty decent film background, and have viewed plenty of student-work that's both similar and superior!  So, first, I have to ask -- what's the attraction?  Three people get lost in the woods while making a documentary on a local legend and eventually die, making this what some people are calling `the scariest film ever.'  I don't think so. `The Blair Witch Project' (great title, by the way) is filmed in the documentary style, yet it divulges the whole scam prior (that the film is staged), making me wonder how viewers can insert themselves into the characters' dilemma or feel any of their pain and anguish.  I agree that the fear of the unknown is oftentimes the spookiest, but if you're in on the joke, then it's known (and therefore invalid).  I wish that the truth of the filming would have been kept a secret; that the directors and company would have kept their mouths shut and let the media-ball continue to roll - then, and only then, would `The Blair Witch Project' have been scary.  Sure, you could fire right back, saying a documentary that encompasses fiction is every bit as justifiable as `Halloween' or `The Shining,' but then again, those two films had genuine stories and backgrounds - nothing ever happens in this film that justifies fear. I understand the directors' intent to reveal real fear, rather than produce digitally-effected monsters that spew blood and goo from their eyes and noses -- and I think it's true that the human imagination conjures up plenty of s**t scarier than any three Stephen King books -- but put a real ski-mask-clad chainsaw-wielding half-breed in the woods with these three characters (in actuality), and watch how quickly their lost-in-the-woods scenario and mysterious pagan stick-figures become secondary.  Hey, Marlon Perkins' Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom specials are real and rousing, but they're not really scaring the pants off of anyone, y'know? Secondly, though to a lesser degree, the movie is pretty poorly made (a fact acknowledged by the film-makers), due to a lack of budget.  And while I celebrate the crew's resourcefulness, the hokum is nonetheless still present (does the fact that you're shooting in a documentary style vindicate amateur film-making?  Only future directing jaunts from Myrick and Sánchez can answer that one).  Still, there are a lot of good scenes Heather's self-filmed confession (completed when she runs out of faith) is unsettling, and some of the locals' stories are just great.  Plus, the creepy ending is pure art no matter where or how it was shot.  And not to be overlooked, the crude bundles of twigs and unsettling stick figures actually look like they were created by a Wicca-starved witch or hermit. Sure, there was a mini `Blair Witch' craze that swept through the American underground, but I'll still take `The Sentinel,' `The Shining' and `The Exorcist' any day!

I don't think so. `The Blair Witch Project' (great title, by the way) is filmed in the documentary style, yet it divulges the whole scam prior (that the film is staged), making me wonder how viewers can insert themselves into the characters' dilemma or feel any of their pain and anguish.  I agree that the fear of the unknown is oftentimes the spookiest, but if you're in on the joke, then it's known (and therefore invalid).  I wish that the truth of the filming would have been kept a secret; that the directors and company would have kept their mouths shut and let the media-ball continue to roll - then, and only then, would `The Blair Witch Project' have been scary.  Sure, you could fire right back, saying a documentary that encompasses fiction is every bit as justifiable as `Halloween' or `The Shining,' but then again, those two films had genuine stories and backgrounds - nothing ever happens in this film that justifies fear. I understand the directors' intent to reveal real fear, rather than produce digitally-effected monsters that spew blood and goo from their eyes and noses -- and I think it's true that the human imagination conjures up plenty of s**t scarier than any three Stephen King books -- but put a real ski-mask-clad chainsaw-wielding half-breed in the woods with these three characters (in actuality), and watch how quickly their lost-in-the-woods scenario and mysterious pagan stick-figures become secondary.  Hey, Marlon Perkins' Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom specials are real and rousing, but they're not really scaring the pants off of anyone, y'know? Secondly, though to a lesser degree, the movie is pretty poorly made (a fact acknowledged by the film-makers), due to a lack of budget.  And while I celebrate the crew's resourcefulness, the hokum is nonetheless still present (does the fact that you're shooting in a documentary style vindicate amateur film-making?  Only future directing jaunts from Myrick and Sánchez can answer that one).  Still, there are a lot of good scenes Heather's self-filmed confession (completed when she runs out of faith) is unsettling, and some of the locals' stories are just great.  Plus, the creepy ending is pure art no matter where or how it was shot.  And not to be overlooked, the crude bundles of twigs and unsettling stick figures actually look like they were created by a Wicca-starved witch or hermit. Sure, there was a mini `Blair Witch' craze that swept through the American underground, but I'll still take `The Sentinel,' `The Shining' and `The Exorcist' any day!

Any sequel following a Romero film that's not directed by Romero himself has got some large shoes to fill, mostly because of the Romero fans out there who think he's God. I didn't care much for the first film and funny enough, I didn't care much for the sequel. The film series had so much potential but it was short-lived because both films were less than stellar. The biggest problem with CREEPSHOW 2 was that it only had three stories (excluding the in-between story), and because the first story sucked beyond belief, it only left the chance for almost half of the movie to be *really* good. I saw CS 2 at the movies and the first segment was a real groaner. Anything dramatic with George 'I can't act' Kennedy is automatically doomed and the Indian Statue story was too hokey and simply didn't belong in this sequel. So after a really trite and dull start, there were only two other stories left to reverse the fiasco of the aborted beginning and unfortunately the two other stories weren't great enough for me to forget the first story. THE RAFT and THE HITCHHIKER are moderately successful, moderately because though the two other segments have their moments, they still sorta fall flat. The two last stories are basically stretched out for too long. It's not that I wanted the stories to happen at a dizzying pace and end fast, but both good ideas found within those stories were sorta nullified by the fact that they were slow and padded and eventually fell flat when the segments needed to be more energized, more erratic and with punchier endings. Also, if the two last stories hadn't been stretched out to pad the movie or had all three segments been more brief with better editing and direction, they could have added a much needed fourth story to the bunch. Having only three padded segments made for a boring feast.The acting and writing in both THE RAFT and THE HITCHHIKER segments are from awful to good. I like Lois Chiles in the last segment. It's probably her best moment on screen aside from her role as Bond Girl Holly Goodhead in MOONRAKER and in DEATH ON THE NILE. But even her role is difficult to understand at times because of the serviceable direction and the unfocused story. Are we supposed to hate her or sympathize with her? Are we supposed to sympathize with the annoying hitchhiker? If the hitchhiker's body was found by other people on the road, what was he when he attacked Chiles? Was he a ghost or a zombie or what? How did the body eventually left the presence of the other people who found him dead in order to attack Chiles? The whole thing is not very clear, even for a supernatural story. And the ending is rather dull and uneventful.As for the infamous THE RAFT story, well, the acting is mostly on the awful side and none of the characters are sympathetic or interesting. The characters would have been more interesting had the actors played themselves. None of the actors are convincing in their specific roles. Paul Satterfield looks smarter than the dumb jock he's playing and the actress who plays his girlfriend is not very convincing as the typical bitchy slut. She seems too timid. The same could be said with the two others who play the plain teens. The idea of the killer oil slick is interesting and creepy but not well executed. There should have been a fifth character to the story, maybe a homeless man or a ranger who lurks around the lake and knows about the oil slick and could have been the watery monster's alter ego of sorts. As creepy as the oil slick is, it doesn't make for a compelling character. And the way the story ends, everything seems pointless.

And that's ignoring the fact that it's the first part in what is, again IMHO, the greatest movie trilogy of all time. There's probably nothing I can say about this movie that hasn't been said before, but who cares, I'll say it anyway. My thoughts on what makes this film so good are difficult to list in only a 1000 words, but here goes. It's the most exciting two hours of film you'll ever see, featuring beautiful princesses, scary baddies, likeable rogues, daring-do and success against impossible odds. It has a masterfully crafted script, one that any student of  screenwriting or film history should study, utilising a template of Joseph Campbell's hero's journey theory and Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress. It's the perfect standalone adventure film, with a classic good against evil battle, yet at the same time hints at the existence of a much grander story that lends it a feeling of incredible depth. It's a film which can be enjoyed by kids and adults alike, and shows that the best kids movies, the ones that really stand the test of time, are the ones that don't set out to be kids movies in the first place, but just to be really good movies that will appeal to kids. It has the greatest opening sequence in film history, featuring the best special effect of all time. It has John Williams fantastic score, featuring the best title theme ever. And of course it has Darth Vader, quite simply the best villain in movie history (I still remember absolutely cacking myself as a kid when he breaks that Rebel troopers neck!).I could go on, but there's really no point. It's been said before but I'll say it again, if you don't like Star Wars, do you really like movies at all? Yes, the dialogue is extremely ropey in places and some of the effects are starting to show their age, even allowing for the changes in the Special Edition. But like the ridiculous 70's hairdo's everyone sports and the fact that C-3P0 is so obviously gay, this just adds to the films charm.

After ripping movie-goers off with The Lost World, Steven Spielberg tosses out a less-then-fulfilling flick, this time in the guise of Amistad.   True story in the summer of 1839, Cinque (Djimon Hounsou) and fifty-some Africans aboard the Spanish slave ship La Amistad break free of their shackles, kill the crew, take control of the ship and reclaim their freedom, hoping to return to Africa.  However, without any navigational skills, the Africans bank on two surviving members of the original crew.  Too bad, because after two months, an American naval ship captures the Amistad and the Africans are charged for murder and piracy.  OK, now you've got fifty Africans who don't speak English or Spanish, an abolitionist named Theodore Joadson (Morgan Freeman) who just stands around, a young real-estate lawyer named Roger Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey) and pro-slavery President Martin Van Buren (Nigel Hawthorne), who only wants to appease the South.  Mix them together and you've got a typical `good versus evil' Speilberg film.  And let me tell you something, ole Stevie sure has a hard-on for these dastardly, `I'm-an-immoral-symbol-of-everything-that's-wrong-with-America-and-the-system' villains Amistad maintains that white people are generally evil, just as ET and Jurassic Park painted humans capitalistic and exploitive and Schindler's List made everyone who wasn't Jewish in the &#145;40s `bad.'  Hell, even The Color Purple made an argument that most black men were ignorant and irresponsible.  In other words, enough is enough!!

With each subsequent viewing, I am becoming more and more disillusioned with Final Fantasy The Spirits Within. It is an affront to nature.The film is supposedly based on the video game series of the same title, but in truth I can see nothing which connects the two. A common thread throughout the game series (I think there are 11 games now) is that each one takes place in a completely different world with new characters, and I can therefore see no reason, apart from marketing purposes, to even call this film Final Fantasy.I'm left cold be this movie. It has no heart whatsoever. Everything is formulaic and lifeless. To be honest, I'm actually left wondering why it was even made. Actually, no I'm not; I know exactly why it was made it's a technology demo. Well then, way to go, Square Pictures! You managed to prove that you can create semi-convincing computer animation via motion capture that looks realistic. Remind me what the point of this was when you could just have shot it in live action anyway. Seriously, why animate something when you can get the same effect, and cheaper, by doing it in live action? I'll tell you why because, if this were a live action film, it would be condemned as complete rubbish. Sadly, because it is completely CGI, many critics have been wowed by its impressive visuals... including Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper, who felt compelled to give it their thumbs up.When I first reviewed Final Fantasy, I gave it 6 out of 10. In retrospect, I most certainly regret that decision. As it is, I do feel that even 4 out of 10 may be a little over-generous, but there are a few moments within the film that rescue it from the depths of having no merit whatsoever. Despite the overall pedestrian nature of the film, I will admit that Sakaguchi and his cohorts managed to create some pretty atmospheric dream sequences. A nice effect is the way that, as Aki comes more and more under the control of the virus she is infected with, her dreams become more desaturated.In many respects, Final Fantasy tries very hard to be a computer-generated Akira. Shame on them for even trying. This film doesn't even come close to Katsuhiro Ôtomo's 1987 masterpiece. Many of the same themes are present (well, you can't get much broader than end of the world), but none of the imagination or heart. Final Fantasy is cold and sterile, and for me it is adequate proof that if you use machines to make your movie, you'll end up with a very mechanical movie. Especially after listening to the commentaries and watching the documentary, I have become aware that this is obviously an assembly-line product, not a creative endeavor. To reiterate Pixar can do it. They are able to use their computers as tools to project heart and emotion. In my opinion, Square Pictures cannot do it. They use their computers to hide their own incompetence.The main character, Dr. Aki Ross, is voiced by the irritating Ming-Na. She gives the most bland, lifeless reading you could possibly imagine. The other voice actors are equally disappointing, projecting their lifeless voices on to lifeless CG models. Special mention must be given to Alec Baldwin, who gives a laughably poor and clichéd performance as Captain Gray (although, admittedly, he's reading a laughably poor and clichéd script).If proving that they could do lifelike CG animation was the production team's only goal, then they have succeeded. However, that means that Final Fantasy was nothing more than an experiment a test that was most certainly not ready to be released to the public. They should have spent more time on developing a story, finding better voice actors and actually animating something rather than motion-capturing it all. It's hardly surprising that Square Pictures folded shortly after the film was released.

With each subsequent viewing, I am becoming more and more disillusioned with Final Fantasy The Spirits Within. It is an affront to nature.The film is supposedly based on the video game series of the same title, but in truth I can see nothing which connects the two. A common thread throughout the game series (I think there are 11 games now) is that each one takes place in a completely different world with new characters, and I can therefore see no reason, apart from marketing purposes, to even call this film Final Fantasy.I'm left cold be this movie. It has no heart whatsoever. Everything is formulaic and lifeless. To be honest, I'm actually left wondering why it was even made. Actually, no I'm not; I know exactly why it was made it's a technology demo. Well then, way to go, Square Pictures! You managed to prove that you can create semi-convincing computer animation via motion capture that looks realistic. Remind me what the point of this was when you could just have shot it in live action anyway. Seriously, why animate something when you can get the same effect, and cheaper, by doing it in live action? I'll tell you why because, if this were a live action film, it would be condemned as complete rubbish. Sadly, because it is completely CGI, many critics have been wowed by its impressive visuals... including Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper, who felt compelled to give it their thumbs up.When I first reviewed Final Fantasy, I gave it 6 out of 10. In retrospect, I most certainly regret that decision.
