Because it really isn't. There's a lot of merit in it, and it's a great addition to the Star Wars franchise. Well then, why do so many people hate it? I suppose there are a lot of reasons. The die-hard Star Wars fans, ie. most adults who grew up with it, hate it because it's messing with their childhood, ruining the film franchise that they grew up with. I didn't grow up with the original Star Wars trilogy, therefore was viewing this film with a completely open mind when I saw it recently. Is it a terrible film? No.Let's start with the visuals, because they are really where this film is strongest. It's all pretty stunning, with incredible cityscapes and backdrops to the story. The spaceships are really beautiful and many of the CGI characters look pretty convincing for a film made in 1999. When looking upon the stands at the race, it's hard to believe that there are hundreds of animated characters, as it all looks very real. The race scene itself is one of the best parts of the film. It's exciting and fun, and it's one of the few moments in the whole trilogy when you're rooting for Anakin to win, as he becomes far too annoying for you to care in later instalments.The overarching plot itself is a bit rubbish, and the whole trade problems thing completely passed me by. To me, the plot of the movie is that Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan go to a planet, find a kid with special force powers like them, take him with them, fight off Darth Maul at the end. There were some parts of the plot that I really did enjoy. I love the fact that Chancellor Palpatine is so obviously evil, even if you haven't seen the originals, but nobody seems to notice it. Also, the whole Padmé is the Queen twist, despite being really obvious, is quite fun. There were moments early on when I couldn't entirely figure out whether they had switched, but eventually I was certain, and it's a great moment when everyone finally realises.Now onto the things that I disliked about the film. Firstly, it's a bit dull in places, and you just want them to get on with it and have some cool action. Secondly, and most importantly, is Jar Jar Binks. I've said it before, but he has to be the most irritating character in movie history. I mean, just how much time could they all have saved if Jar Jar wasn't tagging along with them. I'm sure George Lucas must have thought he was endearing or something, but moments like the electrocuted tongue are more annoying than entertaining. While good on a visual side, the battle with the Gungans and droids at the end is also a bit tedious, and runs along for much more time than it should.

Larry Darrell embodies something that the human spirit always longs for, meaning. Therefore the Character of Larry Darrell is the incarnate for that 'Search' of whatever void there is in a persons soul. And the longing to fill that void. I like Bill Murray even better than I did before when I found out more about the history behind him doing this role. Mr. Murray really wanted to do this film and play this character as he identified with the character in a lot of ways. Also, Bill Murray wrote a monologue in the movie about a character who dies which he wrote in actuality for John Belushi(it makes the scene a lot more endearing seeing it now after knowing that fact). The Razor's Edge is one of my favorite books by W. Somerset Maugham and it was turned into a movie years before this one with Tyrone Power. Power played Darrell very well, he embodied Larry Darrell's unattainable quality to a tee. However, so did Bill Murray, in just a very different way Murray did. Bill Murray plays Larry with such an indifference, where you will see Murray in many scenes with a Blank Look or Murray's usual Dead Pan face. Murray makes a valiant effort at playing one of the most complicated characters of our time in Larry Darrell. The performance Bill Murray gives is hit and miss. However, whether Murray meant to or not, the character of Larry Darrell is very hit and miss as well. Darrell is unattainable, enigmatic, confusing, and perhaps wild at heart, and also perhaps there's nothing going on in Darrell's head or there is so much going on in Darrell's head, you never know from reading the book nor from the movies. So with that said, Murray playing the character the way he did might have been spot on. It's kind of to the eye of the beholder, and in some ways I do think Murray's Blank Stare and Dead Pan features were perfect for how Larry Darrell is. So in some ways, I think Murray made some very good choices on purpose or not on purpose in playing Darrell, but also in my subjective opinion, there were other scenes that I wish he would have made different choices on. But again, knowing that Murray wanted to play this role so bad and that he even wrote the movie along with other screenwriters, makes me like Murray all the more. Bill Murray is a great actor, very underrated in his greatness. This version of The Razor's Edge has a Terrific Music Score, you would think this is a great movie by how great the music score is, and the movie is almost great, but like Murray's performance, it's hit and miss. Some scenes in the movie are very powerful and great(Some scenes are some of the best you will ever see in my opinion). And some scenes aren't so great, they're kind of off, etc.(again, my subjective opinion). Theresa Russell gives an absolutely terrific performance as Sophie. I believe Russell would have been nominated for an academy award for her performance of Sophie, but the fact remains that in the Tyrone Power version made years ago, Anne Baxter was just as exceptional in the role of Sophie, and Anne Baxter was nominated and she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in that role. Both Baxter and Russell were equally terrific in that role and it's tough to say who I like better, very tough to say in fact. Which I really can't, they're equally great. Finally, there's a scene in the movie that hits it right on the money. The book had this particular scenario go a different way as the Tyrone Power version stayed true to the book in this particular scene(basically this particular scene in the Murray version didn't exist in the book or Tyrone Power version).However, I don't know if Murray wrote this scene or not, but the book should have written this part into it, the way it's written and executed in the Murray version. It's an extremely powerful scene and true to the characters. It's a scene where Darrell tries to rescue Sophie from some bad men(I'll just say that without spoiling the scene). Bill Murray plays this very difficult scene terrifically as does Russell, and again, the book doesn't have this, but I wish it would have, it's much more effective in this Murray version. Larry Darrell is a tough character to play. Other actors who have played a similar type of character are Brad Pitt in Legends of the Fall(which Brad Pitt played that type of part perfectly I thought, in more of a romantic kind of way)as well as Peter Gallagher in Underneath and also Richard Tyson in Two Moon Junction(where he plays the mysteriousness of that type of character well, even though he's more of a cad and playboy Lothario, but still deep in his enigmatic qualities).

I believe Russell would have been nominated for an academy award for her performance of Sophie, but the fact remains that in the Tyrone Power version made years ago, Anne Baxter was just as exceptional in the role of Sophie, and Anne Baxter was nominated and she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in that role. Both Baxter and Russell were equally terrific in that role and it's tough to say who I like better, very tough to say in fact. Which I really can't, they're equally great. Finally, there's a scene in the movie that hits it right on the money. The book had this particular scenario go a different way as the Tyrone Power version stayed true to the book in this particular scene(basically this particular scene in the Murray version didn't exist in the book or Tyrone Power version).However, I don't know if Murray wrote this scene or not, but the book should have written this part into it, the way it's written and executed in the Murray version. It's an extremely powerful scene and true to the characters. It's a scene where Darrell tries to rescue Sophie from some bad men(I'll just say that without spoiling the scene). Bill Murray plays this very difficult scene terrifically as does Russell, and again, the book doesn't have this, but I wish it would have, it's much more effective in this Murray version. Larry Darrell is a tough character to play. Other actors who have played a similar type of character are Brad Pitt in Legends of the Fall(which Brad Pitt played that type of part perfectly I thought, in more of a romantic kind of way)as well as Peter Gallagher in Underneath and also Richard Tyson in Two Moon Junction(where he plays the mysteriousness of that type of character well, even though he's more of a cad and playboy Lothario, but still deep in his enigmatic qualities). ","genre":"Drama, Romance, War"},{"date":"30 June 2013","score":"","review":" Stanley Kubrick's sword & sandal epic, Spartacus, is a film that should not be ignored as it holds an importance place in the director's catalog. This was not one of the films that introduced me to Kubrick's works and I came into this thinking it may surprise or immerse me that it would rise at the same level as my opinion on Kubrick's masterpieces. Sadly, it did not hit me with much force as I wanted it to.The plot of Spartacus is the rise of Spartacus from the shackles of Rome's slavery. It is a story that I indeed enjoy but since the film, at times, drifts away from Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) and focuses on Crassus' (Laurence Olivier) goal for power and dictatorship of Rome, it took me out as that half doesn't hold up to the strength in Spartacus' story. It doesn't get to the point that the film becomes dull, so it is still tolerable. I felt Dalton Trumbo's script lacked interesting dialogue and sometimes doesn't create that sense of importance in what they are saying. I believe in a film like this, it is dialogue that should keep the audience invested, as it serves in supporting the plot and intentions of the characters on screen. The rivalry between Gracchus (Charles Laughton) and Crassus is very entertaining as it explores the paths of what Rome can become. It is the screenplay that holds most of the issues I have with this film and if it have been maybe revised or spent a little more time on it, this film would have been a masterpiece.2001 A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, Eyes Wide Shut, Full Metal Jacket, Lolita and Barry Lyndon, are films of Kubrick that I felt were all daring as they have imposed either controversy, antagonizing characters, exploratory themes and risk for low financial gain. Spartacus on the other hand was something of an epic which had extremely high expectations and was easy to market to the public. This film in his catalog definitely seems like an oddball. I felt that Kubrick did not have that creative control in this production as compared to his other projects but he did the best he could with what he had. Kubrick understood the material enough to convey what is needed to tell this tale. He also knew that this film had to be big as the story's themes of hope and freedom had tremendous weight.As I said, this film is large and to convey that, you need to have a cinematographer who can deliver. Russell Metty showed he could handle a project this big. Metty's photography showed the scale of film and, along with Alex North's score, carried significant weight. The battle scenes are example that shows just how big the production is. Metty did not only create beautiful and large long shots but also handled the intimate moments between characters delicately. Scenes with Spartacus and Varinia (Jean SImmons) are captured with such elegance that it is at par with Metty's large ambitious shots. Metty is an important aspect in making Spartacus an epic film that rivals classics like Lawrence of Arabia and Ben-Hur.The film's length, 3 hours and 17 minutes, is a stretch and some scenes could have been a bit trimmed. I felt that the pacing was a little on the slow side for me and with the issues of the film's script, it made it a bit more of a chore. To me, the length of a film is not the issue but rather the content within that length is what determines the necessity of longer running time. If the film explored a little more with the Senate and make it very entertaining and smartly executed then I would satisfied with the running time, maybe even longer.The score of the film is conducted and composed by Alex North, who I recall also did the score for Cleopatra. North's score definitely has a presence in the film and screams out to be noticed but it isn't the grand moments like the battles that gets me listening but rather the intricate moments between Spartacus and Varinia that shows off a memorable tune that creates the element of romance between the two. His score definitely goes hand in hand with Russell Metty's photography and delivers something that will be remembered in the long run.For a character to become believable, the actor must be deeply attached and understand the role that they are embodying. Kirk Douglas definitely shows that here and is one of the big reasons that makes Spartacus' cause all the more believable. While Douglas is the strongest aspect of this cast, it is not without the help of fantastic supporting actors like Charles Laughton, Jean Simmons, Peter Ustinov and Tony Curtis. They really connected with their characters and brought their A-game to the film. The downside of the cast is sadly, Laurence Olivier. Olivier brought as much as he could with the character Crassus but the character is written so thinly that it Olivier couldn't show off his abilities. There is one seen which I thought explored the character Crassus for a bit, and that was the restored scene of him in the bath being washed by Antonius (Tony Curtis).The film has it's weak point but it doesn't place the film as the weakest of Kubrick's films or even within that decade or genre as it is solidified it's classic status with it's iconic score and photography, strong story, and a powerful cast.

On top of this, it is mentioned that Jamal (Brown) is an exceptional basketball player. One night, after a successful game, he is sharing a meal with friends at a restaurant.

The Window, played by Sean Connery, is a very sympathetic character and, as he takes on the role of mentor to Brown's character, the audience is given the opportunity to see it change both of their lives for the better. Until recently, I hadn't watched this film for some time. Since watching it again, I have no idea why it took me this long. You should see this movie as soon as you can.

I have not seen everything Hughes has written, or even directed (Planes, Trains and Automobiles) but I have seen some of his popular and memorable work like Sixteen Candles, Home Alone, Weird Science, Pretty In Pink, Some Kind of Wonderful and Ferris Bueller. Something that I have picked up after seeing enough of his work is that he is a writer who creates these characters that are lovable and adored. When I was a child, I always wanted to be as fearless and clever as Kevin McCallister in Home Alone and that is due to his writing. After watching this film, I feel that he has created his magnum opus in directing and writing but though it's his best, it has it's flaws.The plot of The Breakfast Club is a bunch of high schoolers serving detention. This is where I felt that Hughes' writing may not appeal to some people as this film is definitely not like other high school films out there. Hughes was bold to write about 5 people sitting in a library and talk. The film's goal is not very evident from the start but if you invest yourself within these characters then you would understand Hughes' intentions. It is about empathising the problems of others and understanding that teenagers are beyond the stereotypes society has placed upon them and that we all have our uniqueness that define who we are. This film focuses on these teenagers relationships, status and personalities. Hughes has created five very unique individuals who are viewed by each other within their stereotypes. This then takes the film into a dialogue and character driven direction in order to flesh out these characters and explore the emotions and hardships of their position. I personally found this film to be interesting and definitely relatable, which will be the reason why this film is universally adored.I felt that this was a personal film for Hughes and that he really cared for these characters. He achieved in crafting something that is so deep and at the same time entertaining which allows for one to revisit this film time and time again. What make Hughes so clever is creating young characters in his films that does not feel like they have been recycled from his other work. His most personal moment of this film, I assume, is the scene where they all sit down together and share their personal feelings and views. It really felt like Hughes has been in the situation before and just recreated it for this film.John Hughes and Thomas Del Ruth seem to have gone with a low budget feel to its photography and most of the camera's focus is on the actor's and their emotions and reactions. I felt that this style was appropriate and it does not distract us when key moments are taking place. There is very little movement to the camera and it allows us to take in scenes and focuses a little more on the characterization.The pacing, I thought was done well for a plot that takes it's time in moving things along. It takes it's time with these scenes, except for the hallway sequence which was paced a lot faster to induce tension. Some audiences may find this quite boring at times and may want for more things to happen.The music is driven by pop, new wave songs in the time period and fits very nicely with the setting. The music in this film gives people that sense of nostalgia and may not help themselves but to click along with it. I though, am a product of a later generation so it may not give me that heavy sense of nostalgia but it does get me clapping once in a while.This movie would have not worked and fallen apart if casting failed at acquiring actors who can understand the characters they are playing themselves. Thankfully the actors chosen are perfect and irreplaceable. Chemistry between the actors were excellent and all five play off each other well. These actors would end up working together commonly in later films.The Breakfast Club is a film that you may want to go back to, especially if you are a teenager, and relate to. It would make you think about others and understand the uniqueness that make that person an individual rather than a shade that can be identified solely on their surface.

Some critics think after years of adulation and promotions from fans, that Shawshank Redemption has gotten overrated. In my opinion, I think they are wrong. Never have I been so moved by film. Its intriguing without being vague, intellectual without being conceited, long without ever losing pace but most of all what all art should be inspiring. I left feeling emotionally enlightened, enriched and equally drained. Breathtaking. The score was composed by Thomas Newman was stunning. The main theme (End Titles on the soundtrack album) is perhaps best known to modern audiences as the inspirational sounding music from many movie trailers dealing with inspirational, dramatic, or romantic films. Shawshank Redemption is like wine I guess, the older it becomes the better it becomes, really bizarre how it didn't appeal much at the time 1994, it was pretty hard to beat Forrest Gump, and Pulp Fiction that year. It end up having a cult following, after years and years of being aired on cable television to the point. A lot amount of people have finally view it, and most of the time share the same opinion, it was great. You have two hours to dig into the story - and I can tell you it was worth it. Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film directed by Frank Darabont tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker who is sent to Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd Red Redding (Morgan Freeman), and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation. It wasn't until he meets Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) does he heard that another inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder, suggesting Andy's innocence. It was here that Andy makes a choice, continue to live with the sins in prison, or clean himself up by escaping it. The film wasn't about a grand scheme of plot. It was unusual in the sense that it didn't matter what happens, but only that the message is fulfilled Fear can set you prisoner, hope can set you free. And it did fulfill it. Brilliantly. It is the script and the actors that make this movie so great. Morgan Freeman as Red is the highlight of the film. Before Freeman was cast, Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford, Paul Newman, and Robert Redford were each considered for the role. Although the part was described as written as a middle-aged Irishman with graying red hair, Darabont cast Freeman for his authoritative presence and demeanor. Morgan Freeman is an amazing actor and his narrationing voice is so soothing. While I do like the narrations. Narration in films are always a sign of weakness in the story and plot. It is always used to cover up holes in the story; unless it conveys the protagonist's inner feelings and thought. Here, it conveys Red who is basically telling us what we are witnessing on the screen. While, I do like it, it wasn't really needed. The acting of Tim Robbins was great as well. I love the scene where he play a recording of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro on the loudspeaker. Still, in some scenes, he's too wooden and stiff. Furthermore, he mumbles too much. Both, Tom Hanks and Kevin Costner turn down the role, two actors I do like. I also love Bob Gunton as the Warden, but I really wanted James Crowell as the Warden. I thought it would be amazing to have him in this film. There are some many themes and messages, it's hard to count. The biggest one is the fundamental pillars of human life hope. Some critics do have a problem with the film in some areas like attempts to persuade the viewer to side with rapists, thieves, and murderers. It didn't help that 2007, two inmates of Union County Prison escaped from their prison using similar techniques to those featured in the movie. I think the biggest fault, is that white collar crime pays if you are slick. While Andy was innocent of the murders, he wasn't innocent in white collar crimes. Another thing that some critics nitpick is the deep emotional relationship between two men. I don't see anything wrong with it, thinking it as two men being friends. Some people say it's a homosexual relationship since in prison, homosexuality is normalized. This is clear throughout the film, not only through the characters of the sisters gang, but how inmates' referral to new arrivals as fresh fish. There was also a lot of homosexual symbolism like the Rita Hayworth poster covering up something and how the sewer scene was a symbol for anal sex. If that's isn't weird enough, some critics have spotted many allegorical themes in the film, generally along the lines that Andy Dufresne is a latter day Jesus Christ. No matter what people see in it; even with some prison film clichés, it still a great film. I do like the 1963's 'Great Escape references with the socks. I don't want to spoil anything, but all I can say is, I'm glad I took the time to watch this movie. Overall you build an understanding and feel for the characters, was real sad when certain characters died, really gets to you. The whole concept was smart, it just shocks how it was all put together and it works so well. Brilliant movie. Recommend anyone to watch it at least once in their life time. Don't take my word for it. Just watch it. So Get busy living or Get busy dying.

Science doesn't have to be brought up in a film called THE DEADLY MANTIS but there's still the need for a suspension of disbelief in the storytelling . I don't believe in life on other planets because there's no evidence that there is . That doesn't stop me from being compelled by a television drama from someone like Nigel Kneale because his almost superhuman storytelling technique of spinning an idea out is so intelligent and well done it's impossible not to be caught up in one of his plots . An unexploded bomb being found in London and revealed to be a Martian spaceship is pure fantasy but done so well and with a dramatic realism it's like watching a fly on the wall documentary take place . THE DEADLY MANTIS is an anti-thesis to this From the opening scene the film shoots itself in the foot . A voice over informs us that Northern Canada and the Artic Circle is protected by a ring of radar stations . The Cold War was in full swing and the film has an almost rabidly reactionary edge watching it today , almost as if it's screaming for these damn communists to start something . It also screws up the internal continuity and logic to the movie where the eponymous monster attacks bases and planes and yet it doesn't show up on radar until the story requires it The narrative structure itself is a problem . A base is attacked and a plane brought down but no one except the audience know what's going on . This means the audience are one step ahead of the characters in the movie and are left to twiddle their thumbs until the characters join up the dots . When someone says  Gentlemen we're going nowhere fast  you can't help but nod your head in agreement The classic giant bug film THEM may have also suffered from the same slight problem but that was such an atmospheric film containing moody scenes like the policemen finding the wrecked diner that there was more than enough to hold the audience's attention . Here it isn't and it's not until 33 minutes in to the movie we get to see the giant mantis . As I said continuity is often ignored . For example while attacking a plane earlier in the movie the mantis managed to knock of a chunk of itself but later when it's attacked by rockets and shells it's impervious to them .

Despite both seeming interesting to me, I decided for the other one. A pity; I don't even remember what movie that was, but I certainly won't forget 'Wolf'.Why is this movie so underrated? I read a critic say that 'Wolf' wasn't good because 'monster movies are supposed to frighten the audience'. There, I believe, lies the motive for the much underrate of this everyone seems to watch it expecting a werewolf horror picture, and end up disappointed when they get something different. I guess people would also be disappointed in 'The Godfather' if they watched it expecting a 'Die Hard'.The movie creates an atmosphere that is lacking in many modern horrors, and has a decent werewolf fight scene, but that's it; all in all, the drama is prevalent throughout the film. Even the werewolf point is done in a dramatic angle. People forget, but the werewolf tale is not just about a guy becoming a monster at night. It is about a man becoming an animal and slowly acquiring its traits (the night transformation being just the culminating of this). An animal is not only more feral, but also more cunning and sensitive to everything around him. An animal is not tied by our society's values\/morals but by those of nature itself; this side of the werewolf is rarely put in play, not being as 'exciting'. The story of a man (Jack Nicholson) who faces a crisis in his life, struggling to keep on top of his business is what dominates this film. The werewolf aspect is subtly done in changes of his personality; he becomes more cunning, using dirty tricks in order to keep himself on power, becomes more possessive\/attentive to everything and more lusty (acting on his attraction to Michelle Pfeiffer).The movie is perfectly directed. Mike Nichols, whose works I am not much of a fan (only other movie I liked was 'The Graduate'), never lets the movie fall down fully on horror territory and manages to keep the dramatic aspect engaging through well chosen shots. He is a very good drama director, admittedly.The acting is superb. Jack Nicholson as the wolfman is surprisingly subtle, never fully going in the crazy-mode he is so used to, but making his character believable (while keeping Nicholson's trademark witty and mild manners). Michelle Pfeiffer is also very good, not only looking splendid (she looks younger than she did in 'Age of Innocence', for example) but also having great chemistry with Nicholson even if their relationship never really felt very convincing to me. James Spader, too, really shines as Nicholson's machiavellian antagonist.Complete with an Ennio Morricone music, very good make-up for the transformed wolfmen, and a somewhat unique ending, this is one great hidden gem of a movie.

It felt considered to be truly great, yet nothing quite remarkable, why is that? Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction are majorly responsible. Also though when you're watching The Shawshank Redemption for the first time you might take notice of how fanciful it is, seemingly sugarcoated, and may tend to initially and foolishly discount it as being a soft misrepresentation of life in Shawshank, but as the movie perseveres through gruesome incidents and never shows a single imperfection, never seizes to amaze, it gradually becomes clear that this is a powerhouse of a movie, an undisputed masterpiece, and it's not a distorted viewpoint, it's just lighthearted and viewer-friendly, and you may be required to reassess your feelings towards the film to be valued as one of the very best movies of all-time. The Shawshank Redemption is remarkable. It's one of the very few films that succeeds and even excels at depicting life on the brighter side while still maintaining enough darkly despair in proper prism. Prison isn't a fairy tale world. The Shawshank Redemption doesn't downgrade itself with a too grimy depiction; it's shown in a more pleasant way, in a more powerful way, and it's better this way, with no overstated unsavory trauma. The Shawshank Redemption is loaded with unsavory trauma, it just doesn't dwell on it. It ditches a grim outlook and upholds a faithful perspective. The Shawshank Redemption inspires great hope, even when your spirit has fallen into the darkest of places. Andy Dufresne is one of the best characters from film, period. Andy's unassuming, soft-spoken and distant nature makes him a prime target to befall victim to the hideous injustice of an ill-fated murder charge, but Andy is a brave soul, and he will seek redemption, even though Andy's very own soul is in most need of it. Andy's unfulfilled life has found new meaning in the most unlikely place, Shawshank. The story is among the best ever told. I venture to say that the narration provided by Red is the best, the very best of any movie. The narration doesn't compel you with startling plot developments, rather it guides you with reflection and comforts you throughout the indelicacies of the film. The narration is the driving force and the lasting impression of the movie. The Shawshank Redemption is mega engrossing; you do not quite know where it's heading, but you do not care because it is so good, and where it does eventually land is sheer brilliance, true movie magic. The end is simply genius, a clear metaphor for passing through hardship. I love that Red makes it to the good life too with Andy; this movie would have lost all of its might if not for its beautiful, happy ending. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those rare dramatic masterpieces as it's right up there on the short list of being the greatest movie of all-time. Give it its due.

My viewpoint will be a little different than the usual review's take on matters due to that reason. I hope this review is interesting to the reader, but the reader must realize my different viewpoint.Despite the movies and plethora of TV shows treating the existence of ghosts as a given there actually is no conclusive evidence for such things. The various TV shows that depict ghost hunting are bemusing, at most; most probably delusional, as they will show people equipped with thermometers, emf meters, infrared cameras, and other such specialized equipment looking for ghosts yet one wonders just how can one prepare oneself to look for something if that something has never even been proved to exist in the first place? And, there is no surprise, at least to me, when they never find anything conclusive.Yet, the belief in ghosts must have some foundation. Somebody, somewhere, must have experienced or seen something that is ghostlike. And, this movie deals with that position. Here, a live in babysitter (modern term for Deborah Kerr's role) experiences some things that are not easily explainable. Yet, nobody else seems to experience what she is experiencing. Or, do they but don't tell her? She has two young children to look after in a beautiful but rather empty Victorian mansion. The children are brother and sister and provide a sort of emotional mirror to a grown man and adult woman who had died fairly recently in this place and whom the children knew. The babysitter has an older woman to help her and this woman tells of the love of the now dead lovers. But, are the dead lovers gone or still there. The babysitter sees these ghosts in a frightening manner that seems to indicate no doubt of their existence...but nobody else does!! Not told in this story but implied is the fact that this babysitter (governess as they called them back then) is unmarried and around 40. Certainly she has some emotional issues over that! Though Deborah Kerr said this her finest role, her physical beauty was such that nobody could imagine her character was unmarried for lack of attention from men. In the original story the governess was probably more of a frustrated plain Jane who had issues with that fact and probably projected herself into the story of the dead lovers for that reason. So, is the governess imagining the ghosts or are there actually remnants of people now dead still lurking in that area? While watching the movie and trying to answer that question be prepared for some frightening events and sheer emotional terror. No great special effects like you see in modern films; just suspense and terror. They don't make these sort of films now like they used to so it is well worth viewing for a couple of hours.

As you know, 'Halloween 5' ended with Jamie in the police station after some man in black killed all the cops. Well for six years, Jamie has been held against her will by that man and several of his twisted staff. She was also impregnated and now has a newborn baby. Sadly Michael murders, Jamie but could not find what he was really after - her baby boy. Tommy Doyle (the little boy from the first film!) is all grown up now, and still obsessed with what took place that night in 1978. He finds the baby where Jamie hid it from Michael, and spends the film with Kara Strode, her young son Danny and Dr. Loomis trying to keep it safe from the masked killer.I like 'Halloween 6' because it puts a real effort into taking us back to the original. We see Tommy Doyle, the little boy whom Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) babysat in 1978. We also get introduced to a part of the Strode family, the Strode's of course were the family that adopted Laurie from the Myers'. And the Myers house ACTUALLY resembles the original house, which of course it didn't in the fifth film. George Wilbur makes his return as Michael Myers. He played Michael in 'Halloween 4' and did a great job then, so it was glad to have him back after the underwhelming job Don Shanks did as the killer in part 5. The acting was good all around, in particular from the Strode family characters (Marianne Hagan, Kim Darby and Bradford English). And Donald Pleasence puts in a marvellous performance to end his brilliant career.The real story of this sixth instalment is that we find out WHY Michael has been killing for all of these years. We first saw the Thorn symbol in 'Halloween 5'. Well apparently, Michael was programmed as a child (using this Pagan\/Magical Thorn symbol) to kill his family! They give a large explanation on this, but basically when the Thorn symbol appears in the stars on Halloween night each year, it prompts Michael to murder. It explains the method behind Michael's madness. It's a bit far fetched of course, but I liked the efforts to bring a refreshing twist to the story. And it ties all the loose ends we were left with in 'Halloween 5'.Although I liked the idea of Thorn because it brought life to the series, I also view it as a flaw. I think it was far more dark not knowing what was behind Michael's wanting to kill his family. It made him more creepy and insane. Knowing that he was controlled to do what he did for years, only tarnishes his villainous reputation and makes viewers almost sympathize. The gore was good in this, a step up from 'Halloween 5'.

I can suspend disbelief, but this is ridiculous. Perhaps it is because I know too much about how this movie started, have lived in Hollywood myself and seen many documentaries on the real lives of prostitutes. The original script was intended as a very dark, cautionary tale about class warfare and prostitution in the Los Angeles area. It was then completely revamped as a high budget romantic comedy. As a result, it became one of the most successful box office movies of all time. First, while there are probably many handsome johns - they rarely are as good looking as Edward (Richard Gere). Nor are they as respectful. Well, maybe on one of those sugar baby websites. But that's different than picking up some random dude on the street like Vivian (Julia Roberts) did. After their first sexual encounter, Edward hires Vivian for the week to escort him to social events. So she's giving it up for a whole week for 3K? Maybe that was the going rate in 1990. He also gives her access to his credit cards. I suppose that could make up for it -- and maybe there are some guys who have done that before. Seems like a stupid move to trust a woman who takes sex for money. She could run those things up in no time, especially in a ridiculously expensive town like L.A.Vivian gets snubbed on Rodeo Drive. Well, that's believable, because anyone without their nose in the air gets snubbed there - street whore or not. But being snubbed at the hotel makes no sense. Many of those hotels make their living with high end prostitutes. Or at least bimbos who look like they are. Go to any fancy hotel and you will see decked out babes. Doesn't mean they're all whores -- but many of them look like they could be. I once found out in Vegas that many women who dressed up there were hookers. And I had a classy dress that revealed nothing - in fact, it wasn't even tight.So we are supposed to believe that Vivian isn't capable of buying a dress or using utensils at the dinner table? Sorry, she is not street enough to believe that. She looks like some chick who ran away from Nebraska - not a down and dirty Hollywood whore. Or course, Heidi Fleiss had a stable of classy looking chicks. But that's the point - a woman who looks like Roberts is usually part of a service, not someone hanging out on the street. I've heard that many johns like to tell their secrets and bare their souls to whores. So when Mr. Nice Guy reveals that he was estranged from his now dead father that could make sense. Because poor little Vivian was snubbed at the store, Edward comes to the rescue and takes her shopping. I think the most dangerous thing about this film is that even though it is rated R, plenty of young girls have seen it. Glamorizing prostitution in any way is irresponsible. Some prostitutes may have married one of her johns. But that's something that happens less than the chance of winning the lotto.Prostitution will always exist, but let's not make it out to be something it isn't. Sure, there are probably some happy hookers out there - but I've not met or heard of a single one. The truth is that most of the people I've seen or known of who have sex for money came from abuse, are on drugs or have very low self esteem.This whole movie is so phony and full of lies -- not even the ad is real. They used a body double because little miss goodie two shoes herself -- Julia Roberts - while willing to play a street hooker - not only refused to do nude scenes, but the movie poster legs aren't hers, either. Or maybe she didn't look as good in the photo. I rest my case -- this movie is just a disgrace.

The filming of the Horse's head scene and the dining room scene where Robert Duvall requests John Marley to give a film\/singing role to one of the Don's relatives. Marley declines Duvall as you see a horse prancing in the meadow outside. Duvall says he will tell the Don in NY. Marley shrugs off Duvall. I was within 50' of both scenes. Coppola actually used real heads of horses ( they were shipped in ice in huge crates, they mixed a blood concoction). Coppola actually was very picky about the head he wanted to use. When Marley opens the sheet and discovers the head, it looks like sunrise. It was actually raining outside, and yellow cellophane was put on the windows. With the proper lighting, it looks like the sun was coming up, yet it was raining outside. The scene of the horse prancing outside was done at another location. The Guggenheim family were very rich and had art collections, etc throughout the mansion. The police were there to safeguard any of these collections. My girlfriend (now wife of over 41 years) was away at college. Banks of phones were set up. I was on the phone talking for a long time each of the three or four days assigned there. I was young and did not realize the assignment that I was on would be so important in the movie world. There were plenty of staff, extras, etc there. We were there for over 10\/12 hours per day. Meals were catered. I also was assigned on traffic sometime later near the toll booth scene, filmed out on the old Mitchel Field Air Base. If you look close, at the toll booth, yellow parking lines are on the ground. Lindbergh, a friend of Guggenheim, flew from nearby Roosevelt Field.
