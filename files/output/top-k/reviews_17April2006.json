Its great, all the adventure and excitement, and Mrs. Brisby is so cute. This was something totally different from any cartoon I saw, and I did saw many. For the first time my feet's were rubber. I think this mainly is because everything seems so familiar, like I watched it when I was little, and yet I can't remember any scene that I had seen, but when I watched it today, all the images, was like I saw them before. I am sure that I saw it sometime, when I was a little kid, I could feel it. I don't have words to tell my sensation. The Secret of Nimh is one of the single movies in witch there is blood. It puts your heart in action when you see when Brisby cuts herself in the wire that locked the birdcage, or at the fight between Jenner and Justin. How the character moves and acts also is extraordinary, and I always like to watch Mrs. Brisby how it acts, how it moves when she talks. Watch the reading book scene by her when she meets Nicodemus, and not only, and watch carefully all her acts, how her head is moving while she reads the book, and through all the scenes that she appear, either when she is at the owl, when she talks with Nicodemus, while she attempt to enter the rats rosebush, while she is chaged, and you will understand what I want to say ). The Secret of Nimh is one of the movie that doesn't include songs and stuff like Disney's cartoons, making you just love it more, single song being 'Flying Dreams' witch I like it very much. I'm listening it at least once each day ). The colors and graphics also are amazing for a film from '82, see the owl and Nicodemus eyes for example, and all the other characteristics, the way they move, they look, for all the personages especially the principal's ones. In no other film I sayed this specific thing before, but the voices are just outstanding implemented. Not only Mrs. Brisby as I sayd is very cute by the way she is drawn and her moves, but also by her voice, witch seems so delicate, Elizabeth Hartman being for sure the most perfect voice for Brisby. Never the less the actor's voices that played as the Owl and Nicodemus are just extraordinary, giving you such a special feeling. This is just a little part of my feeling about this movie, and I would write even more, would comment the excellent plot, if the English wouldn't limit me. This is one of my single major commentary's that I writed in English, and I hope it isn't very bad. ","genre":null},{"date":"17 April 2006","score":"","review":" Wow I just watched it.

But this is, in my opinion, genuinely the perfect war film. Because it came out in the same year as Saving Private Ryan, Malick's masterpiece took a back seat to a grittier, more realistic war film. But what we as viewers got in 1998 were two movies that showed different aspects of war. Saving Private Ryan is hailed because the film-making was so involving and intense that it makes the viewer feel like they are actually in war. On the other hand, The Thin Red Line, from one of the finest director\/screenwriters in the world, Terrence Malick, does not dilute the effect of the violence of war, but it also shows how psychological war can be. Often, we have seen movies like Apocalypse Now, where the mental damage of war drives a man to insanity, but that is not what Malick wanted to show. The Thin Red Line is just as realistic as Saving Private Ryan, but the emotional spike is far more powerful. Part of that comes from Malick's trademark transcendentalist film-making, showing the sweeping landscapes and the beauty of nature, while at the same time emphasizing the environmental injury brought about by the interaction between men and nature. Part of the emotional draw comes from the characters, and there are many. Sean Penn and Nick Nolte are phenomenal as they always have been, but it is the supporting cast that brings the reality of this film to light. Dash Mihok comes off as a surprise, as does Jim Caviezel, in one of his earlier roles. But there is also the Malick silent character, here personified by a pale and small Adrien Brody. Other actors of note that only made this film more incredible include Elias Koteas, Ben Chaplin, John Savage, John Cusack, and Miranda Otto. But one of the keys to the success of this movie is the powerful, ominous score by my personal favorite, Hans Zimmer. The scene in which the army storms the Japanese camp is chilling, both with what is shown on screen and how Zimmer's music hauntingly beautiful. All of the elements of fantastic film-making are present, yet that does not answer fully the question of why this movie alone stands above all the other war films in history. What does Terrence Malick do that makes The Thin Red Line so effective? When you watch war movies, there is seldom a personal feel them. Hundreds of soldiers race into battle, and many of them die. The Thin Red Line has these cliché scenes, but there is another echelon of consciousness. Malick uses voice over narratives not to explain what is happening, but to explain what exists in the mind and not on the battlefield. War is not merely fought with arms, but with minds and hearts. At one moment, an American is killing Japanese soldiers and ridiculing their dead; yet soon, he shakes so hard that he cannot contain his own fear. This is kind of war that has never really existed before in film. For a plot as simple as taking one hill on a Pacific Island in World War II, The Thin Red Line supplements with substantial philosophy and psychology, showing the humanity as well as the darkness of war. In essence, The Thin Red Line is the most complete war movie ever made. If it had come out a year before Saving Private Ryan, perhaps we would consider it first when we think of revolutionary films. It is a complicate tale, one that is anti-war while still recognizing the courage and glory of it. You would be hard pressed to argue that it can be labeled as simply as pro or anti-war. But that is how Malick tells his stories. The moral ambiguity of humanity set against the backdrop of the natural world is his method. I have never seen another movie as significant and brilliant as The Thin Red Line. It is easy to compare it with movies like Platoon and Saving Private Ryan, but Malick's film is on an entirely different level.In this war, there is a thin red line between sanity and madness.

Flipping through channels, I see a company logo indicating a movie is about to start. Whenever this happens, I am mentally and physically unable to change the channel until I know what the movie is. Seeing that it stars Richard Dreyfuss and Jenna Elfman, I know immediately it is Krippendorf's Tribe, which I remember being advertised but never saw. Not having anything else to do, I keep watching.That was my first mistake.The second thing I did wrong was to continue watching past the first commercial break, and on to the end credits. I was completely fascinated by how utterly terrible this movie is. I don't think I've ever seen a movie this awful with so many recognizable, decent actors taking part. Dreyfuss, Elfman, Lily Tomlin, David Ogden Stiers, Stephen Root, Natasha Lyonne, Siobhan Fallon, Elaine Stritch, Tom Poston, Susan Ruttan...all names I know, all actors I've seen before, never in anything this ridiculous and pointless.During the opening credits, we see Professor Krippendorf and his family in New Guinea, hanging out with a local tribe. Next we see the Professor on his couch two years later watching his video of this trip. It is soon revealed his wife has died, and apparently he has been on this couch ever since, because Jenna Elfman shows up at his door to remind him he has a presentation that night about the lost tribe of New Guinea. She's supposed to be his former student, now fellow professor of anthropology, but she spends the entirety of the movie acting as agent between Krippendorf and a cable network. Sounds like the writer really paid a lot of attention to this character.So he sits at McDonalds with his unruly children and tries to write a speech for his presentation, but comes up with nothing. When he arrives at the lecture hall, hundreds of people wait for his groundbreaking research to be revealed. Of course, he doesn't have any research. Whatever this lost tribe is, he never found it. So it's still lost. But I'm asking myself, what lost tribe? I just saw the video footage of him with a tribe in New Guinea! Is that not them? If not, who are they? Why are all these people at the lecture hall expecting something of him? If he didn't find anything, why don't they already know that? Where did they get their expectations? Why can't he just say I didn't find that tribe, and my wife died, and I've been kind of depressed? Why didn't he tell them that when he got home from New Guinea?Other stupid questions Why did he buy a big screen TV with the grant money? Why didn't he use the grant money to pay his mortgage and his bills instead of allowing his home to near foreclosure? Why is he so close to losing his house if he's still on staff at the university? If he has an office and friends there, why don't they have any idea what's been going on with him professionally for the last two years?I realize a supposedly screwball comedy requires there to be a great deception during the first act, which must then be supported through the third act until all is revealed. That's fine, but as far as the story being told, there is no reason for them to expect anything, so there is no reason to lie. It's my understanding he'd have this presentation to tell them what he found. If he didn't find anything, why can't he say so? Why do they expect something amazing? Who told them something amazing had happened? And why is this business of a lost tribe being brought up as if I knew what they were talking about? Is that why he went to New Guinea? To find a lost tribe? Why has this exposition not been supplied to me? All I know is, the movie opened with him talking to members of a tribe, and now he's saying he lost the lost tribe. That makes no sense. None of the first part of the movie makes any sense.That's only the beginning. The rest of movie is filled with jokes that are either totally inappropriate or just plain fall flat. Jokes about circumcision? Is this the funniest thing they could think of? One of his kids puts on some kind of show and tell about a native girl's first menstruation. Why? The only good thing about this scene is the one-line role of a young Mila Kunis as his classmate playing the native girl. He's even unwrapping a bloody cloth in the next scene. I just don't see the point, or the humor.Nothing in this movie is funny. Everything plays like a bad old sitcom at best. Three minor positive notes One - the aforementioned Mila Kunis, who has a spectacular voice, though as I said she only has one line, but it was nice to see her. Two - Jenna Elfman's butt. In her underwear. Not exactly a reason to see a movie, but if you are watching the movie, it's there in a pair of brief scenes; yes that pun was intended. Three - cinematographer Dean Cundey, always a pro with the pretty pictures. Why he chose to work on this movie, I'm sure I'll never know. I hope they paid him handsomely.

It is soon revealed his wife has died, and apparently he has been on this couch ever since, because Jenna Elfman shows up at his door to remind him he has a presentation that night about the lost tribe of New Guinea. She's supposed to be his former student, now fellow professor of anthropology, but she spends the entirety of the movie acting as agent between Krippendorf and a cable network. Sounds like the writer really paid a lot of attention to this character.So he sits at McDonalds with his unruly children and tries to write a speech for his presentation, but comes up with nothing. When he arrives at the lecture hall, hundreds of people wait for his groundbreaking research to be revealed. Of course, he doesn't have any research. Whatever this lost tribe is, he never found it. So it's still lost. But I'm asking myself, what lost tribe? I just saw the video footage of him with a tribe in New Guinea! Is that not them? If not, who are they? Why are all these people at the lecture hall expecting something of him? If he didn't find anything, why don't they already know that? Where did they get their expectations? Why can't he just say I didn't find that tribe, and my wife died, and I've been kind of depressed? Why didn't he tell them that when he got home from New Guinea?Other stupid questions Why did he buy a big screen TV with the grant money? Why didn't he use the grant money to pay his mortgage and his bills instead of allowing his home to near foreclosure? Why is he so close to losing his house if he's still on staff at the university? If he has an office and friends there, why don't they have any idea what's been going on with him professionally for the last two years?I realize a supposedly screwball comedy requires there to be a great deception during the first act, which must then be supported through the third act until all is revealed. That's fine, but as far as the story being told, there is no reason for them to expect anything, so there is no reason to lie. It's my understanding he'd have this presentation to tell them what he found. If he didn't find anything, why can't he say so? Why do they expect something amazing? Who told them something amazing had happened? And why is this business of a lost tribe being brought up as if I knew what they were talking about? Is that why he went to New Guinea? To find a lost tribe? Why has this exposition not been supplied to me? All I know is, the movie opened with him talking to members of a tribe, and now he's saying he lost the lost tribe. That makes no sense. None of the first part of the movie makes any sense.That's only the beginning. The rest of movie is filled with jokes that are either totally inappropriate or just plain fall flat. Jokes about circumcision? Is this the funniest thing they could think of? One of his kids puts on some kind of show and tell about a native girl's first menstruation. Why? The only good thing about this scene is the one-line role of a young Mila Kunis as his classmate playing the native girl. He's even unwrapping a bloody cloth in the next scene. I just don't see the point, or the humor.Nothing in this movie is funny. Everything plays like a bad old sitcom at best. Three minor positive notes One - the aforementioned Mila Kunis, who has a spectacular voice, though as I said she only has one line, but it was nice to see her. Two - Jenna Elfman's butt. In her underwear. Not exactly a reason to see a movie, but if you are watching the movie, it's there in a pair of brief scenes; yes that pun was intended. Three - cinematographer Dean Cundey, always a pro with the pretty pictures. Why he chose to work on this movie, I'm sure I'll never know. I hope they paid him handsomely.

Flipping through channels, I see a company logo indicating a movie is about to start. Whenever this happens, I am mentally and physically unable to change the channel until I know what the movie is. Seeing that it stars Richard Dreyfuss and Jenna Elfman, I know immediately it is Krippendorf's Tribe, which I remember being advertised but never saw. Not having anything else to do, I keep watching.That was my first mistake.The second thing I did wrong was to continue watching past the first commercial break, and on to the end credits. I was completely fascinated by how utterly terrible this movie is. I don't think I've ever seen a movie this awful with so many recognizable, decent actors taking part.

When the movie was first out, no one knew about it. It didn't make a huge fanfare and the Groundhog Day movie never did make it in the IMDb top 250 movies, at least in the beginning.Why this movie is one of my favorite comedy of them all? For one thing, you can watch the movie over and over again and still enjoy it. The making of a classic is it has many elements put into the movie, much like Casablanca, but this is more like Casablanca comedy. What elements does this movie had. It was perhaps the first movie that introduced Groundhog Day originates in Punxsutawney, PA and it is done every year. For Phil it is his fifth time. The second part of the movie is its unique comedy. For those who likes time travel movie - like me (e.g.Timecops,Time Machine, etc.), or those who want to know the future this is THE movie. The third element is a very good question and one that has already effected me as I am actually living in this kind of life (not rich) What would you do if you live in eternity? Would you complain, enjoy, or grow. Phil has been through all the human emotions he can enjoy, from irritation, surprise, being God, care little about the future, hate, taking advantage of the future, to finally maturing and growing.The best part of this movie is This is THE MOVIE on how to date a woman! Really! One of my past time is to read for fun (but not really do it) a great many articles on picking up a woman, using NLP (Neural Linguistic Programming), and other tricks.To summarize in a nutshell how to date a woman is not to view a woman as a GAME (or a prey), or make a Woman your Prize, or try to please her too much. A woman can spot a man's sense of insecurity and weaknesses in a mile! You can use all the tricks of NLP or in simple language, using the right keywords and other robotic movies and she can tell. Evolution of a woman over a man on this area is something a man will always loses. It is best not to try to be something you are not.This movie also tells you of the most common mistakes a man can make with dating a women. The way to date a woman or get a woman to like you is to make you HER PRIZE. And this is clearly shown in the movie. By making everyone like you through all the things you do, develop your skills, get other woman to want you, and she will want you. This theory in dating is the key to success and it is one of the few movie where a totally retarded man (like me) on dating can really learn this movie if one has any understand of what is going on in the movie. It is just more than getting a woman it is the development of a man's own identity and what he does.This movie basic premise is to relive your life over and over again, what would you do if given that chance, variety of emotions in the movie, and the meaning of life, romance and everything all in one. What more could you ask? Repeat viewing of this movie gets better and better. It is the best comedy movie I ever seen. In my opinion, the IMDb ranking deserves to be higher than #179 and it is only recent that this has even made it to the top 250. It should go higher still if people realize the hidden messages of the movie should you be a cynic or should you view life positively. The screenwriter did not realized they have just wrote a masterpiece. The comedy and everything are unique only to this movie and it is well worth the watch! You won't be bored.

The film isn't bad, but no matter how one tries to disguise it, preachy is preachy. There are a few things not too evident in the film. One is how many typical Americans totally concur with the societal views of Norton's character, especially everything he said at the dinner table. Maybe people don't want another Hitler around, but millions do feel the way he did about immigrants and why America has been falling into the toilet. So when they come out the mouth with a guy with a huge swastika tattooed on his body, they appear to be extreme. Considering that even right now, at this second,with racism so high among non-whites towards whites, and many millions of Americans being tired of the advantages illegal immigrants have for instance, those views aren't always so extreme after all.And the racism in the film - it's predominantly white-on-black, and again, since the whites here are skinheads and Nazis, their views seem extreme despite the millions that agree (again, short of reviving Hitler). It is rare we see black-on-white racism in the movie, and even when we hear (or see in the deleted scenes) that the leader and the fat guy got attacked by blacks, they don't get too much sympathy from the viewer. The black kid in the final violent scene probably came the closest to showing any black racism, muttering the phrase white boy earlier in the film and getting in Danny's face.The turnaround of Norton's character in the prison is just too convenient. The film even gets a little sappy here - watch the neo-nazi lighten up to his black cleaning partner, because the black guy does funny things and makes him laugh. It's almost like this black guy was there for Norton's amusement, putting on a minstrel show, even wearing a sheet over his head imitating a klansman and making funny sounds. Look, now they are even talking about basketball together! If you spend one-on-one time with anyone long enough you will lighten up to them, but to change your whole philosophy?

He has made some cult classics in the past and Bad Taste is possibly the pinnacle of his early endeavors.I would give this movie 10 stars, except for the fact that the movie doesn't cover any important issues...except for alien invasion. Not all movies need to tackle say..racism, bigotry, aids, genocide, discrimination but if this movie did, it would be a perfect work of art acceptable for hanging in the Louvre thus garnishing it a 10.I kid you not, you might look at the DVD cover and say What a piece of crap this appears to be and you would be completely wrong. So very wrong. 1) The movie had a super low budget but it fools you into thinking it doesn't. Peter Jackson made the film at his parents home in New Zealand.

I'd heard this film had won Oscars and I'd heard of the beach scene, but knew nothing else about the film. I thought it was partly a romance and partly a look at the army. I was caught up in the forbidden love of Kerr & Lancaster and interested in Clift & Reed's 'relationship' and was eager to see how they resolved their problems. I was also getting the impression that the Army was an awful place to be - Lancaster, Sinatra & Clift's characters experienced a great deal of hardship and misery because of their enlistment and from their fellow men. So it came as a shock to me when these men supposedly in love refused to try to better their miserable positions in the army by trying to move up or out of it. They spurned the women just to stay in the army? Even though they were miserable where they were they chose the army as their love. What? That made no sense. Their superiors were all incompetent or sadistic losers, in the case of Clift, nearly all his fellow enlistees treated him like dirt. The army was the reason his best friend was killed. Yet because that's all he knew, he stuck to it. IMO, that's not a good reason to choose something.As the film was from 1953, I thought it was set AFTER WW2 and didn't realize this was the days right BEFORE Pearl Harbor- so the bombing was a shock. I had to rethink my experience of the entire film. I could appreciate how even after all the misery everyone banded together for defense. If the men had turned away from their women after the attack that would have made more sense. I could understand not wanting to transfer away once the action starts. My biggest problem with the film was that I could not for the life of me understand why Clift did not identify himself when he was coming back to the base!?!?! That made no sense at all. Of course they're going to shot someone they don't recognize who won't identify themselves in the midst of an attack. So I went from sympathizing with him for most of the film to thinking he was an idiot.In the end I had very little sympathy for any of the male characters. I thought they were stupid for choosing to stay in their miserable lives. If this had been shown as a patriotic choice following the attack I could have understood it better. Also, I thought the scene with the guy refusing to pass out ammunition during an attack as showing the rigidity and stupidity of the military - which I don't think was the point of the scene\/movie.

It's not because of the dubbing (it's a foreign film and once you accept that, you can look past it). It's not because of the budget (it was 1956). It's because the film was horribly miscast & had a horrible script. If their intention was to be faithful, then they left out a lot of crucial parts and really messed up Esmeralda's character. For a tragic story, this movie is way too colorful. The ironic thing is that some of the previous and subsequent film versions, that sugar coated this story, look darker. Anthony Quinn; a good actor, so what happened? Why does Quasimodo look nothing like how he is described in the book? He played Quasimodo like a mutant ape man, who's hardly deformed, and not even hunched over, nor does he have a hump. Well he does have a hump (if one could call it that). But the fact of the matter is, he still looks like Anthony Quinn. Chaney, Laughton, Hopkins, & Patinkin were all unrecognizable. There was also no big dramatic reveal of him in Quasimodo costume. Gina Lollibrigida; I thought Esmeralda was supposed to be a 16 year old virgin French girl, that was kidnapped, and raised by gypsies? In this film, she looks like a 36 year old tavern wench. She over acts, and some of the dancing sequences are embarrassingly bad. They're long, her singing voice is almost of a baritone quality, she sings too low and out of her range, and, for a short moment, she stops dancing, laughs at the crowd, and then goes back to dancing. What the f*** was that? Another sequence that really irritated me (and wasn't even in the book) was when she first spots Quasimodo (not afraid of his features mind you, but later in the bell tower she is?) points out to the crowd and says, Look! Look at his ugly face? In order to crown him king of fools. Alain Cuny; Now, Victor Hugo had a knack for writing really great villains. In the novel Frollo was such a beautifully written, multi-facet character. Alain Cuny ALWAYS has the same expressionless look on his face, and not once do we ever get the scene where Frollo pours his heart out to Esmeralda in the dungeon, that scene (which is in the book) defines Frollo's character and makes the viewer able to understand and sympathize with him. But again, Cuny ALWAYS has the same stone look on his face. Even Vampira in Plan 9 from Outer Space had at least one different expression. No, not Cuny. All he does is just mope around. Derek Jacobi nailed it when he played Frollo, Richard Harris almost got it, and with Sir Cedrick Hardwick, you could tell that occasionally he would be troubled by his conscious, it was in his eyes and in his delivery. This Frollo is more like a grouchy kid in a playground who doesn't want to talk to any of the other kids. And what's worse, they changed his character to an Alchemist and nothing more. And even then, what is an Alchemist doing inside Notre-Dame? If he's not serving the church in anyway, why is he there? When the character is changed to a judge, at least it is a suitable and cautious change. When it's priest, it's faithful. But what is he in this version? And why does Frollo spread his arms out, and let Quasimodo through him over the cathedral? The actor playing Gringoire contributes a lot of embarrassing moments by injecting a lot of unneeded, and inappropriate, slapstick humor and over acting. The actor playing Clopin; doesn't display any kind of leadership skills. He's such a scrawny looking thing that one wonders, how did he become a leader of cutthroats. I always imagined Clopin to be a little more tough and intimidating looking. It's as if they cast Paul from the Wonder Years to play the king of thieves. The actor playing Phoebus was too sympathetic and not so much a player or womanizer as he was in the novel, or the 1939 & 82 versions. Now for the direction The big scenes, such as the flogging, the trial, the rescue from the gallows, and the storming of the cathedral, were all executed very poorly. The more action oriented scenes were very slow paced and did not have any sort of dramatic music resulting in some very non-rousing sequences. In every film version, including the silent one, you either want to cry or feel very sorry for Quasimodo when he is flogged. This is the only version where I could not express any kind of emotion. And I've seen them all, even the bad ones. Not once do you ever feel sorry for Quasimodo in this film. The only scene that even comes close is when he hits his head on Big Marie after he's scared Esmeralda (who wasn't scared of him earlier in the film). Why didn't they use dialog from the book like so many other versions? The ending is the only thing in this film's defense. But... Even the ending was poorly executed. If you ever read the book, you either want to burst into tears or just kill yourself. Here, for some strange reason, you don't feel anything, and Esmeralda's death happens a little too quick and you become unaffected by her demise. And even then, they changed the way how she died and eliminated a very important character, as well as eliminating any mention of Esmeralda's real background. Should you avoid this at all costs?

The movie Gremlins is about a boy named Billy Peltzer. For Christmas, he gets three unusual rules, (Don't get him wet, Don't expose him to light, and never, NEVER,feed him after midnight)and a cuter than cute as a button creature called a mogwai. The Peltzer family names the mogwai Gizmo, and instantly, and accidentally, for that matter, break the bright light rule. Gizmo is shocked for a moment, but recovers in seconds.They learn that bright light hurts Mogwais. The next 15-20 minutes are all just packed with extremely cute stuff that Gizmo and Billy do together. then, the water rule is broken, and Gizmo multiples. The new mogwais are nothing like Gizmo. They just seem meaner than Gizmo(and they all ARE meaner). The new mogwais have a leader mogwai named Stripe. (Stripe has a white puffy Mohawk on his head, so you can tell him apart from the other mogwai.) And finally, the new mogwais trick Billy into feeding them after midnight, and become (you guessed it) Gremlins. The Gremlins are as mean-spirited as they were when they were mogwai! They are still even lead by Stripe! And Stripe still has a puffy, white Mohawk! The only differences between the Gremlins and the evil Mogwais are Gremlins are slimy and evil and can hurt you, and the mogwai are furry and evil and cannot hurt you (yet). The Gremlins reek havoc,(but worse, MUUUUUCH worse) on the town, which is very funny.The acting is tremendous and the puppetry is amazing and the movie itself is jaw dropping.

I've watched this movie in theaters and expected it to be a lot like the games. I have played Final Fantasy and grew up with people who loved Squaresoft for every games they made. At the time this movie was released, I was really into Final Fantasy, but only 9. I haven't played any other Final Fantasies but I intend to, just busy stuff in the way.Anyways, I was hyped up at this movie, as did many other Final Fantasy fans. A movie that was going to be based on the best game series ever. That would be fantastic. I watch the previews and the only reaction I had was eh? Is this Final Fantasy or anywhere NEAR what is usually is? Absolutely not.Final Fantasy are usually games full of magic, sword, fantasy-like world, and beauty in its landscape and its colorful and most descriptive\/addictive storyline. I have to admit, Squaresoft are pretty darn good storytellers. But this movie is first revolved around futuristic Earth, which in no Final Fantasies appeared to even exist. It's like Aliens or any other sci-fi flicks but 3D. Ahh, the powerful touch Squaresoft has. This was the time when such advancement into the 3d world was appearing before eyes. Squaresoft;however, awed everyone in its beautiful styles implaced in every details. It's almost so beautiful and art-like. But this game wasn't art-like. Sure it was like watching a full cinematic movie, but it didn't have that touch and feel that the Final Fantasy games were known for. Don't get mad at me, dear FF fanatics, but I truly TRULY enjoyed Final Fantasy 9 and I was enraptured and bound by both its beauty in music and art. I absolutely loved Final Fantasy not because of its awesome RPG gameplay, but because of the beauty and the power that Squaresoft has on you as they almost sing to you the magnificent story. THIS Final Fantasy was merely an action-packed movie about some marines fighting off some creatures known as souls. Yes, Squaresoft had to include that bit of piece to make sure that element of lore and fantasy-like feel didn't disappoint Square fans. But I'm sorry Squaresoft, but it did. I didn't give a clue who on what these so called aliens were. They were of no aspect NEAR how a Final Fantasy game's enemy is presented.Truly I don't see how this is anywhere near a Final Fantasy, as it is just some sci-fi movie about futuristic humans fending against aliens of some sorts. Sure, it did keep me entertained, but the story and the feel didn't surprise me. I've seen many sci-fi flicks, and that's all it was.

I wasn't expecting much more than standard Hollywood fare, so I really wasn't let down by it. The plot is pretty good, and presents a damn good dilemma. Neither my wife-to-be nor I could truly take either side. It's too bad the movie had to take one, partly due to the fact that the choice is a bit on the banal side. This is one movie where I would definitely have preferred to be left in the dark, for the film-makers to let the audience figure out for themselves what to think and believe. I suggest they watch some Alejandro Amenábar. Oh well... that's Hollywood for ya. The acting is solid. I kid you not, even Zahn wasn't an embarrassment. The action is pretty good, though somewhat limited. There's intensity enough to go around, the action just didn't seem to have enough scope, at least in my opinion. The characters are reasonably well-written. The biggest problem is that the two stances on the dilemma are just not fairly presented. We've got pacifistic and appealing Washington on one side... and Hackman, crazy old coot, on the other. Gene blows up near the end and loses all and any sympathy he may have garnered throughout the film, as the agenda of the film-makers becomes too blatantly obvious and heavy-handed(made worse only by the very end scene). Anyone looking for something intellectually stimulating(granted, a Hollywood movie isn't exactly the brightest place to look, but still) should look past this flick. Mindless entertainment and less-than-subtle manipulation is abound here. The one thing, however, that the film achieves nicely is the isolated, claustrophobic mood of a submarine. Now, arguably, I haven't seen enough of these films to say for sure(since this is, oh, well, the very first one I've seen), but in that respect, Tony does good. Well done, Mr. Scott. But as for the movie as a whole and the plot... Hackman is just too far away from being any kind of a likable character, and the trigger-happy, manic Gandolfini isn't much better, nor are any other characters on their side. I know most American cinema pits good versus evil, right versus wrong... but couldn't wrong at least be the opposing side(the Russians)? Or, even better, be more ambiguous? Just so it didn't feel that much like a lecture and rather food for thought. Anyway, if you can ignore and\/or accept the manipulation and the Hollywood factor, it's not that bad.

Suddenly it was Art, the 3rd best silent film I'd ever seen, behind City Lights and Broken Blossoms. It's wonderful what some TLC can do - no wonder this can now be seen as one of the best films ever made, is in the AFI's list and the Thames version is readily available on DVD.The story moves fluently on the lines between the Confederate and Union lines, with the ballet-like machinations of the opposing sides a wonder to watch. Keaton's comic inventiveness in this doesn't let up for a minute, chasing the Yankee's and later being chased back by them, playing about with great or titchy blocks of wood or violent water towers or errant bayonets. Keaton was accused in the press at the time of bad taste when the Union sniper got the bayonet in his back - how times have changed!An absolute classic for all reasonably normal people, if you don't like it you can't like silent movies but must like wasting your time.

Suddenly it was Art, the 3rd best silent film I'd ever seen, behind City Lights and Broken Blossoms. It's wonderful what some TLC can do - no wonder this can now be seen as one of the best films ever made, is in the AFI's list and the Thames version is readily available on DVD.The story moves fluently on the lines between the Confederate and Union lines, with the ballet-like machinations of the opposing sides a wonder to watch. Keaton's comic inventiveness in this doesn't let up for a minute, chasing the Yankee's and later being chased back by them, playing about with great or titchy blocks of wood or violent water towers or errant bayonets. Keaton was accused in the press at the time of bad taste when the Union sniper got the bayonet in his back - how times have changed!An absolute classic for all reasonably normal people, if you don't like it you can't like silent movies but must like wasting your time.
