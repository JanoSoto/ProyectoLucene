Evil Li does his impression of Keanu Reeves' Neo, from blinding fast movements against slow motion scenes to the displays of superhuman strength.  The sci-fi aspects of the plot take a back seat to Li's display of martial arts.We all know what to expect from Jet Li a lot of action and little of everything else.  He makes no attempt to set apart the parallel versions of his characters.  Although the early scenes in the movie show the differences in the series of events in every universe (Al Gore is the President of the United States in one alternate universe), it does not translate to Li's acting.  Even his characters' fighting styles showed no distinction between each other, despite his claims that they are.But what he does right, and does very well at (pay attention, van Damme!), is delivering solid galvanizing series of fight sequences.  And unlike most other action film actors, he does not have to strip off his top to do so. His lengthy battle with himself is one continuous rush of energy that never loses steam.  So we can't tell apart good Li from evil Li, but that is the point of it we aren't supposed to.  Just sit back and enjoy the battle, because there probably won't be another one like it, or one near as good as his.Sadly, this is all about Li.

The rest of the characters are thin.`The One' is not a bad film.  However, the lack of plot development particularly in the science fiction aspects leaves a sense of being cheated, because it has been promoted as such.

Before the internet, and DVDs with commentary, this sort of feedback was impossible. Think about that for a minute, to realize the possible future impact!!(And I pause to add, if any of you who think you are true film fans, but are not yet watching movies on DVD, are still in the dark ages.

The pacing is just right, the acting is first-rate, and when we get to the end, and see lady Liberty sitting there on the shore, everything in the story comes together. Planet (2001) is not that kind of movie.  Director Burton didn't want it to be.  He wanted it purposefully to be ambiguous.SPOILERS, again - When Leo gets back to Earth, in what looks like our current time (judging by the vehicles, the D.C. buildings, the clothes, the cameras, etc) he encounters something he did not expect. Although Burton could explain how it got that way, he chooses not to, for the sake of a possible sequel by the studio. He, or we, could think up a number of scenarios, but we must assume that the events depicted in this film are responsible for changing the past some time way back, so that evolution proceeded on a diferent path.  You see, the apes he returns to are quite different from the apes he encountered at first, and escaped from. These apes did not shuffle around, but walked like we do. They drove cars, rode motorcycles, used cameras, flew helicopters.The whole point of Burton's film was to show the circular nature of time travel and changes it might trigger. If Leo had not chased the chimp, then his crew and mothership had not chased him, and crashed, allowing this ape race to flourish, then history would not have changed.  That is the only germane dramatic element here, that Leo instantly felt the whole burden of this adverse change in the history of mankind, his decision to chase the chimp dramatically altered the history of mankind.This is only a story, a fictional film, so let's not get too wrapped up in it. However, it does illustrate a truism that we seldom focus on.  Each of us, in everyday life, make decisions, do things, that trigger other things, and so on.  If we could go back a day, or a week, or a year, and make a totally different yet still correct set of decisions, our whole present and future would be different. And that's what happened in Planet (2001) -- Leo's decision had an unimaginable influence on mankind.  I wonder if the writer and director thought that deeply about the message??This is not a very good film, but not nearly as bad as a few reviewers say it is.  I found it fairly entertaining for the most part, and generously rate it 7 of 10. Much has been made of the 13 hours of extras in the 2 DVD set.  Well, unless you are a die-hard Planet of the Apes fan, most of the extras are just not that interesting, once you've seen the movie. Aside from Burton's choice to not explain the story, I found it interesting how he has difficulty completing a sentence with a complete thought. Maddening to listen to. I'm sure he is a fine director, but the guy just doesn't have the ability to complete a thought!

I am an aspiring film maker, and I only wish that I could of come up with the brillant work that is this movie.Originally, when I first saw it. I wasn't impressed, I was younger, stupid, and used to the original version of the The Thing A couple years later, I had gotten a dvd player, and when I had some money on me, I was looking to buy some dvds. Then John Carpenter's The Thing caught my eye. If you asked me why I bought this movie, i couldn't tell you why to this day, cause even though, it was the most expensive dvd, and if I had not bought it, I could have gotten 2 dvds for the same price. I went ahead and bought this movie. From then on watching it again, I realised things about it. Things I probably didnt understand when I was younger. Which is what makes this movie brillant, cause you have to think.Sure, this movie has gore and everything like that, but that doesnt mean anything! Some people view that as a bad thing, but it's not. Not everything in life is sugar coated, and if there was a thing like that from outer space, Im sure it would be alot like that way from the movie. The gore isnt what I love about it though. One thing that makes John Carpenter great, is that I think alot like him. He uses alot of cheap thrills, and to me cheap thrills are the best thrills. I love the fact that the movie is built on paranoia. The scene where Fukes, is walking with a candle, and the dark figure runs by him, and he says who's that!? is just scary. It leaves alot open for the imagination from that point. You ask yourself who was that? and since it's dark, it makes you wonder what it looked like too. That's why to me, showing the thing is not as effective as when you dont. Carpenter did have alot of gore and showed alot in the movie, but when you think about it, there was alot he didn't show. That he left open for the imagination. And you weren't sure who was who. The dvd is great too, cause you get to hear the commentary by John Carpenter and Kurt Russell. Little suttle things that Carpenter did as a director is what makes this movie great. Just one shot in the movie, of Kurt Russell from behind is really effective...because it makes you wonder is he being watched, or is he a thing? In my eyes, it always seemed like he was being watched, and that to me is scary. ","genre":null},{"date":"23 November 2001","score":"","review":"  One of the best movies in my mind.

First off, I came out of the theater being amused at this film for the same reason I had for Chungking Express. Two films are very similar in content, tone, and style. I was afraid that this movie would be too French for me to connect with.

It is an in your face display of stop at nothing embrace for life, love, and the world around us. I laughed most of the way.

From things I've read and people I've talked to, the second answer appears to be the consensus - but I'll be damned if I thought the point was driven home in any meaningful way. I bring this issue up first because I find the confusion symptomatic of the entire movie driving home a point in any meaningful way is not something this film is particularly good at.To start with the positives, though the visuals, I thought, were quite trippy and memorable - and Spielberg did a fine job of balancing his own style with Kubrickian trademarks, and thereby achieving a kind of third type of thing in the end. At least, he did in the first section (David and the parents at home) and the incredible last section (New York submerged under the melted ice caps). But I thought the middle section - the punk apocalypse of the Flesh Fair and Rouge City - was actually pretty tawdry and underwhelming. It tried to beat Blade Runner and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome at their own game and it just looked shoddy and derivative.That whole middle section of the movie, anyway, was pretty much a waste. . .. . . . And I say that because, for me at least, whatever interest to be found in the film is either in that first section (i.e. the psychology of a human family learning to live with, and eventually love, an AI) or in the very last - with the notion of a world which has been completely taken over by automatons (or, as they're called in the film, mechas). Focusing the story on either one of those two tangents would have been worthwhile.  What the film *did* choose to focus on - David's search for the Blue Fairy and his desire to become a real, live boy - was remarkably simple-minded and reductionist. Ultimately, I just didn't CARE about David, because his quest was stupid and ill-fated from the very beginning. Nor did I think it was smart to set up a mecha as our tragic hero since I am after all a human being, I am much more interested in the reaction of human beings in an increasingly mechanized and roboticized society. Leave it to cold as ice Stanley, though, to prefer following a robot around than a human being. But then leave it to the sentimental Spielberg to try to humanize that robot, leaving him as an annoying hybrid. What I mean to say is that, if Kubrick had lived to direct the film, while it may not necessarily have been any better, I think he would have had the good sense to keep David eerily robotic at all times - whereas Spielberg couldn't resist the temptation to make Haley Joel Osment emote and carry on like a real live boy. And thereby muddling the theme (ya see, Steven, he *wants* to be a real boy, he's not supposed to already *be* one).In those moments - mainly early on - when little Haley is permitted to fully be an android, he is dead on and extremely chilling. What he was called upon to do was quite subtle and complex - to totally subsume his humanity, and yet to inhabit a being which longs for and apes that very humanity. This kid is not just a great child actor - he's a great actor, period. (As for Jude Law, the other major actor here - he was great and hugely entertaining in his role as a gigolo AI, but his character seemed more of a contrivance and an afterthought than anything else.)As to that ending, with the mechas\/aliens I must admit, I didn't even so much as *entertain* the notion that they were AIs until I read a comment someone made about the movie online. The fact is, if they're supposed to be mechas, that really raises a lot more questions than it answers. Such as, well what happened to all the humans, then? Also, when did AIs become sophisticated enough to be able to run an entire society without input or instructions from their makers? Surely, none of the AIs we see during the course of the movie is anywhere near that self-reliant (both David and Gigolo Joe are dependent upon, and serve at the whims of, others). Finally, why would these advanced robots be so interested in finding out about mankind? Presumably, they're far more perfect and efficient than we could ever be, and anyway they're only running at all because they already have human programming built into them somehow. My point here is this if the movie is indeed positing an eventual all-mecha society, then it is being lazy and disingenuous in the extreme to only mention it as an afterthought, a footnote to its otherwise Pinnochio-lite movie (by the way, didn't all that direct quoting of Pinnochio get on your nerves - it's like Stanley and Steve were worried that we wouldn't get the reference or something). If an all-AI world is in the cards - then, dammit, that's a WHOLE *OTHER* MOVIE!! (and one I'd prefer to see)Obviously, any way you slice it, that ending opens things up for much more speculation than the filmmakers allowed themselves to engage in. Certainly, you can make the valid point that one can't criticize a movie simply because it wasn't the one YOU would have made. But, really, I'm puzzled as to what Stan and Steve thought the point was of their movie as they conceived it. What - that robots are people, too? Umm. . . they're not, guys.

In his defense, the camera DOES love him, but its slightly overdone and the film begins to take on the tone of a glossy shampoo advert after awhile. In a weird way, that just adds to the fun though. The film is stunning to look at, and it has a strange kinetic energy that makes me overlook the flaws and concentrate on what's right about it. The hero was certainly an inspiration for the style of some of Quentin Tarantino's characters, with his love of The Silver Surfer, etc. This film is actually referenced in Reservoir Dogs, according to the IMDb...Cheesy, overblown and tacky at times, but it's an 80's film, so why should you be surprised?

It has a real macho\/homo-erotic tone; but for those of the hetrosexual persuasion there is the lovely Valeri Karpinski's body to stare at for a large part of the running time...Gere does his early 80's cheeseball riff on the 'sexiest man alive' circa American Gigolo (a MUCH worse film than this) and stares moodily into the camera several times. In his defense, the camera DOES love him, but its slightly overdone and the film begins to take on the tone of a glossy shampoo advert after awhile. In a weird way, that just adds to the fun though. The film is stunning to look at, and it has a strange kinetic energy that makes me overlook the flaws and concentrate on what's right about it. The hero was certainly an inspiration for the style of some of Quentin Tarantino's characters, with his love of The Silver Surfer, etc. This film is actually referenced in Reservoir Dogs, according to the IMDb...Cheesy, overblown and tacky at times, but it's an 80's film, so why should you be surprised? In this reviewer's opinion it's still great fun. Be warned, though; If you hate Richard Gere, as my friend does, then stay away, because all this film will do is serve as a 90 + min refresher course in just why you feel that way...

Why can't film makers take horror movies seriously?  As bad as this film is I didn't have too hard a time sitting through it.  The same cannot be said for Part 3 which is just terrible. In this film the dead are brought back to life again.  In the Return series, unlike in the Night of the Living Dead, the zombies can't be killed.  Or can they?  This series just doesn't make sense.  What starts off as a pretty good suspenseful film quickly turns into a comedy and a bad one at that.  The acting is terrible but I think it was meant to be that way, regardless it doesn't help.  The first zombie we see is great, very scary and well introduced but he is quickly done away with and never seen from again.  The rest of the zombies are boring as they prance around town. This movie is supposed to be funny, it is not.  I would assume it is supposed to be scary, it is not.  The weird thing is it is still okay to watch.  I don't recommend the film but you could rent worse (like Part 3).  If you want a living dead film stick to the Romero entries in the genre (I haven't seen the first ROTLD film so I can't recommend it but it's supposed to be good).  This film rates a 3 out of 10.
