Common knowledge would say that it was a very bad film. And yes, technically speaking it's not the best by any means. The plot's like swiss cheese, acting on most fronts is perfunctory, which compliments the script's quality nicely (if unintentionally) and the whole thing borrows and cannibalises many, many monster\/sci-fi genre conventions. And you know what, ever since i first saw it on the big screen, i still enjoy it. Maybe that's because i was so young at the time that i couldn't care less about the finer qualities of cinema (i was, and still am to a limit, a self proclaimed monster movie nut) and have seen it so many times from then onto the present that i haven't had time to mature to its faults in between viewings. I'm not saying its a great movie by any extent. In fact there are moments where I admit it is very poor. But it does enough things right to stay afloat.Staying pretty close to the fundamental concept of the original Japanese Gojira, Godzilla is all about a phenomenally massive, radioactively mutated reptile, causing mayhem and destruction to the nearest mass populated metropolis. It's up to the local scientists and militia to find out where this thing came from, why its here and how to stop it. That's not the most concise version of the plot, but it's not too bad either. Lets elaborate on the new stuff.Changes have been made to Americanize the story, two of which are obvious; the lizard wasn't a result of the Horoshima fallout but of French Pacific Island nuclear testing; the city under siege is Manhattan, not Tokyo. Attempts at modernising the tale for a contemporary, more environmentally conscious audience have resulted in turning the monster into a fish eating, asexual, egg laying creature just trying to find a suitable nesting site, thus he (why is it called a he if it's pregnant?) isn't just destroying stuff because it's a nifty past time. The person who finds this out is a biologist Nick Tatopolis (Matthew Broderick), who's dragged out from his study of Trenoble earthworms to deal with this slightly bigger specimen. Him, along with the US Army led by Colonel Hicks (Kevin Dunn), track the beast from early sightings and boat attacks on nearby island chains up to the big apple itself. They aren't alone. A French secret service group led by Philippe Roache (Jean Reno) is on the same trail to clean up the mess his nation indirectly caused. On top of all this we have Nick's college sweetie Audrey Timmonds (Maria Pitillo) in the city pursuing a news reporter career, with help from cameraman Victor 'Animal' Palotti (Hank Azaria) and his wife Lucy (Arabelle Field), with a chauvinistic anchorman Charles Caiman (Harry Shearer) getting in the way. (You can choose to ignore the last plot strand if you wish)So that's Godzilla without the big 'plot twists' that take place at various points, but will no doubt be anticipated by any conscious individual watching. The main story and characterisations have never been the monster\/action\/disaster flick genre's main attraction and that's no more true than it is here. All the players are caricatures and genre stereotypes and any attempts at depth (Nick and Audrey get back together after a long hiatus) are dealt with very poorly, but thankfully its not enough to sink the whole ship. Its left to the actors to carry all the scenes that don't feature the titular monster (too few) and most of them do the best they can with a script that does nobody any favours. Shearer, Azaria and of course Reno have good comic moments and seem to take the script as the preferable but unintentional tongue in cheek variety, Reno especially, hamming it up as the dude who knows the score and goes through the whole ordeal with a knowing confidence and swagger. No one else makes an impression. Broderick is adequate for the lead but nothing more. Pitillo, despite looking gorgeous, comes off kind of annoying as the love interest, playing it in semi-dumb blond mode (still, that girl is hot!).The movie is successful in two areas, the first been Emmerich's once again not very subtle but still amusing political satire on America, from their gun ho culture in neutralising threats, the scathing media, to the mispronunciation of Gojira that becomes Godzilla. Genre movies are also parodied (although that could be kind talk for outright plagiarism) from the likes of Dino DeLaurenti's King Kong to Jurassic Park (featured in a horrendous chapter containing Baby Godzillas), plus the Mayor of New York, Mayor Ebert, is a caricature of the real movie critic Roger Ebert.The monster itself is the second and most noteworthy success. A concoction of both the original Godzilla and modern day reptilian design, it's a marvel to look at. Yes, the fact that it's a CGI creation is unmistakable, but it transcends the dated technology with a soulful performance, present mostly due to the way it's animated, with a lot of naturalistic detail in its behaviour, instilling feelings of intimidation, awe and endearment (its phenomenal size adds to the intimidation factor). The action scenes are directed and choreographed with Emmerich's nack for large scale destruction and special effects, and both are therefore top draw. There are some stand out sequences, the most memorable been when Godzilla first takes a stroll through Manhattan which is both awe inspiring and exciting.Godzilla is no masterpiece, not even a good film in some areas and as far as remakes go it doesn't rank highly. But it's an enjoyable piece of fluff that overcomes its glaring faults by been occasionally funny (sometimes unintentionally), satirical and containing a handful of well orchestrated action sequences featuring one of the best movie monsters in recent film history.

Even now, forty plus years after its debut, it retains a satirical bite that still horrifies and amuses in equal doses. As a parody of the arrogance and insanity at work during the arms race, it rewards repeat viewings and should rightly be considered as one of the director's masterworks. Whether it is better than the likes of Paths of Glory, 2001 or A Clockwork Orange is down to personal choice, but as far as I'm concerned, Strangelove is the moment where Kubrick proved his worth without question.What makes Dr. Strangelove so enjoyable is the combination of the horrific and the hilarious. Nuclear Armageddon was the most terrifying possibility of the Cold War and yet Dr. Strangelove is a comedy. Of course, the idea of all life on earth being blasted into atoms is so terrible it is painful to think about, but Kubrick's film doesn't tackle the subject with kid gloves. Rather, it shows of the folly of human nature that would lead to such a catastrophe which provides a lot of black comedy to the proceedings. Mercifully, rather than mugging the camera, the cast play it straight all the way through and to see the straight-laced Sterling Hayden declaring his resolve to prevent Communism sapping America's precious bodily fluids is just the tip of the iceberg.Everyone in a position of power is mercilessly ripped into. The President (Peter Sellers) is a fussy individual, almost completely unaware of what his own staff are up to and prone to chatting idly with the Russian Premiere as atomic weapons hurtle towards his country. The Generals in the shape of Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) and Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) are paranoid, gung ho conspiracy nuts. The bomber pilot Captain Kong (Slim Pickens) is a decent enough good ole boy but so determined to follow orders that he will embrace genocide and the chief of defence, the titular Doctor (Sellers again) is a former Nazi who has changed his name but not his ideologies. All of them are foolish men, full of pride and ambition but whose shortcomings are all too apparent, an ensemble cast this strong has rarely been matched.Admittedly, Kubrick's anti US military bias is a little overbearing (notice the only man in uniform with any sense is a British RAF Officer) but it doesn't matter in the long run. One sided it may be, but Dr. Strangelove isn't a documentary by any means, it's a satire rooted in reality but sufficiently distanced from it enough to raise smirks when millions of people are consumed in a fiery inferno.If you take anything away from Dr. Strangelove, it's most likely going to be either Peter Sellers embracing three roles at once or a man riding a falling H-bomb to his doom, cheering all the way, but it's well worth watching multiple times as each viewing opens up new layers. The incredibly quotable script is one such joy (Gentlemen, you can't fight here, this is the war room!) as are such instances as machine gun battles in front of peace signs or the barely contained delight on the staff faces as the ten females for every male plan unfolds.In short then, a parable of fear that somehow became one of the most powerful comedies of all time. It taps into the political anxieties of the Cold War with aplomb and can teach even a casual viewer a thing or two about the period. Highly recommended and if you've already seen it, just watch it again.

Rita Hayworth and Cary Grant don't always hit their dramatic marks, the special effects may seem dated to today's audience, and there are some contrived plot twists. But there is so much heart and emotion, such great cinematography, quotable lines and swift direction by Hawks that makes this film worth watching. If Scorsese had made 'The Aviator' in 1939, this might be what it would look like.Bonnie Lee (the always wonderful Jean Arthur) is a piano-playing showgirl on her way back to New York, stopping between boats in Barranca. She quickly falls in with a band of tough-shelled pilots who fly mail over the dangerous mountains, rain or shine. The leader of this bunch is Geoff Carter (Cary Grant, in his first dramatic performance), with the toughest chip on his shoulder. Within the first 20 minutes we see, mostly through the eyes of Bonnie, the death of a pilot in a fascinating flight sequence. But the most important part is how everyone reacts after the death of a friend. While Bonnie is grief-ridden, she is more shocked at the lack of sympathy and refusal to acknowledge the death. She quickly learns that this is the only way for them to deal--if someone dies, they shrug it off, as if to say he wasn't good enough, so he died. I'm better than him, so I live. After a few tears she becomes, like all great Hawksian women, just one of the guys, joining them in a spirited rendition of The Peanut Vendor, in one of the many memorable bonding scenes. Beneath the stoicism, there lies a web of friendship and heart that makes this film work.Bonnie then decides to stay for a few more days, hoping to get to know Geoff. And in those few days, another surprise visitor appears Bat Kilgallen\/MacPherson, a pilot shunned for jumping out of a crashing plane, leaving his fellow engineer to die. The engineer just happened to be the brother of Kid Dabb (Thomas Mitchell), Geoff's best friend. Also along for the ride is Judy MacPherson (Rita Hayworth), Geoff's ex-love. Stress and sexual tension soon arise, and complications get even more complicated, from Bonnie falling for Geoff to Kidd dealing with his hatred for Bat as well as his physical problem that could compromise his career, and Judy's confusion as to why everybody hates her husband. Finally everything comes to a climax in a stunning flight scene.As usual, Hawks assembled a great cast, even despite the problems. Jean Arthur makes a great Hawksian woman by giving her role the empathy that would otherwise be lacking. Thomas Mitchell, widely known for his work in supporting roles including GONE WITH THE WIND, gives a quiet and sorrowful performance as someone whose whole life is flying and isn't ready to give it up. It's very refreshing to see Cary Grant in something other than a screwball comedy. Geoff Carter is the kind of role that would be perfect for John Wayne (who later frequently collaborated with Hawks), but Grant gives the role a sensitivity that would've been lacking in Wayne's super stoic persona. Grant has a scene at the end that requires tears and emotion, the first we see from such a hard man, and he doesn't quite get there. But from other scenes, he is so commanding you can't help but surrender to him, just as Bonnie does. Their scenes are magical together. The same goes for Rita Hayworth; she was still early in her career, and her inexperience shows (not that the flat character does anything to help). However, Hawks hired her because she had a face the camera liked; her presence and radiant glow is so alive you almost forget her shortcomings. Almost.With today's CGI-ridden special effects, the ones here may dull in comparison. But the cinematography, especially of the planes flying over the beautiful Andes, are stunning, and done without the help of a green screen. That's what I love about these old movies you can always tell that the directors spent more time talking with the actors and writers than worrying about the special effects, which is what make the special effects truly special.Many note that this was Howard Hawks' most personal film of his career--he frequently associated with pilots, and he knew the characters inside and out. This is what gives the film the heart that it needed. His trademark dialogue and speed becomes a necessity to not become too melodramatic and maudlin, with both wisecracking and wise results. Hawks was the Spielberg of his day. Like Spielberg, there is such an air of professionalism even during the outlandish situations and circumstances, a heart and a brain and courage to each shot.

Beneath the stoicism, there lies a web of friendship and heart that makes this film work.Bonnie then decides to stay for a few more days, hoping to get to know Geoff. And in those few days, another surprise visitor appears Bat Kilgallen\/MacPherson, a pilot shunned for jumping out of a crashing plane, leaving his fellow engineer to die. The engineer just happened to be the brother of Kid Dabb (Thomas Mitchell), Geoff's best friend. Also along for the ride is Judy MacPherson (Rita Hayworth), Geoff's ex-love. Stress and sexual tension soon arise, and complications get even more complicated, from Bonnie falling for Geoff to Kidd dealing with his hatred for Bat as well as his physical problem that could compromise his career, and Judy's confusion as to why everybody hates her husband. Finally everything comes to a climax in a stunning flight scene.As usual, Hawks assembled a great cast, even despite the problems. Jean Arthur makes a great Hawksian woman by giving her role the empathy that would otherwise be lacking. Thomas Mitchell, widely known for his work in supporting roles including GONE WITH THE WIND, gives a quiet and sorrowful performance as someone whose whole life is flying and isn't ready to give it up. It's very refreshing to see Cary Grant in something other than a screwball comedy. Geoff Carter is the kind of role that would be perfect for John Wayne (who later frequently collaborated with Hawks), but Grant gives the role a sensitivity that would've been lacking in Wayne's super stoic persona. Grant has a scene at the end that requires tears and emotion, the first we see from such a hard man, and he doesn't quite get there. But from other scenes, he is so commanding you can't help but surrender to him, just as Bonnie does. Their scenes are magical together. The same goes for Rita Hayworth; she was still early in her career, and her inexperience shows (not that the flat character does anything to help). However, Hawks hired her because she had a face the camera liked; her presence and radiant glow is so alive you almost forget her shortcomings. Almost.With today's CGI-ridden special effects, the ones here may dull in comparison. But the cinematography, especially of the planes flying over the beautiful Andes, are stunning, and done without the help of a green screen. That's what I love about these old movies you can always tell that the directors spent more time talking with the actors and writers than worrying about the special effects, which is what make the special effects truly special.Many note that this was Howard Hawks' most personal film of his career--he frequently associated with pilots, and he knew the characters inside and out. This is what gives the film the heart that it needed. His trademark dialogue and speed becomes a necessity to not become too melodramatic and maudlin, with both wisecracking and wise results. Hawks was the Spielberg of his day. Like Spielberg, there is such an air of professionalism even during the outlandish situations and circumstances, a heart and a brain and courage to each shot. Under his wings, even the flawed WINGS soars.

Yes, Hayworth is beautiful. But even a beautiful women needs a plot. This film doesn't have one. Well, maybe it does. But not in the first hour I was able to endure before giving up. I don't see how I can write ten lines about this travesty, but I'll try in order to spare others the torment of having to watch it. The characters are totally uninteresting. Something like the Departed though without the violence. But in this case, it might have prevented one from falling asleep. Boy, this site would be a lot more useful if it didn't insist on ten lines. Maybe it's only for the movie mavens who can appreciate the pretentiousness of Gilda. Too bad. I need real people's reactions, not critics.
