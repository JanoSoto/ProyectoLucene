His ex girlfriend on the other hand is tired of him and she is a rather cynical businesswoman who is looking for a suitable actor to star in her Farmers Bounty advert,and she swore off men since her breakup with Stuart.Leopold however at first struggles to come to terms with our society but he quickly overcomes this and decides to dress like his from the 21st century resulting in him to be mistaken for just an actor as Kate's brother Charlie(Breckin Meyer)meets Leopold later in the film. But when Leopold meets Kate later on in the film (as Stuart ends up being gone from the story for a very long time thanks to having no elevators since Leopold is the inventor of elevators BTW) romance blossoms between Leopold and Kate(even though when Kate first meets Leopold she doesn't believe for a second that he is who he says he is a 19th Century bachelor who was transported from 1876 to 2001,and she thinks his too good to be true). Leopold however gets on so well with Kate's younger brother Charlie who helps him out with winning a girl called Patrice, and later Leopold saves Kate's purse,and then he sweeps her off her feet with a romantic candlelit dinner on the top of the apartment building and he of course falls in love with Kate. So will he and Kate ever get together,and will Leopold either stay in the year 2001 or 1876?Bottom line I really enjoyed this film in actual fact I consider this film one of my favorite movies of all time as well as it being a guilt pleasure too as it reminded me of that 2007 film Enchanted. The main reason why I loved this movie was because of one actor Hugh Jackman. He just took this movie and made it his own. His charisma and persona lit up the screen every time he shows up with Meg Ryan(who was one of my favorite actresses as a kid)and his character Leopold was like a Disney prince for the older audience. As for the rest of the film yes its a tad but stupid with a very contrived plot but like I said I really enjoyed it,between the chemistry with Ryan & Jackman as they were funny and sweet together not to mention Jackman's character Leopold is so dashing you can't help but fall head over heels in love for the guy. The music by Rolf Kent was nice as it fit the mood of the movie,so was the cinematography where it starts off in old New York City for like 10 minutes and then it goes into modern day New York City in 2001 and of course the finale of the movie was a bit silly as (spoiler alert)Meg Ryan ends up going back to 1876 as she was in the photos her ex boyfriend Stuart took while he was in the year 1876 at the beginning of the movie and Kate ends up been chosen as Leopold's bride at the end. But having said that it was a harmless sweet romantic film with that Cinderella vibe to it mixed with old- fashioned romance which I haven't witnessed in a romantic film in a very long time. Also the romance like I have mentioned was slow paced yet you knew when Leopold was going to fall for Kate as they were destined to be together.Best part Hugh Jackman wooing Meg Ryan over and tries to propose to her character as they listen to that Breakfast At Tiffany's song Moon River but for me it has to be the chasing scene with the thief stealing Kate's handbag and Leopold saves it for her by riding on a horse saying 'give me your hand,your hand woman'. Hilarious stuff.Worst Part The whole time traveling thing was kinda stupid and the plot is OK as you need to be able to follow the plot and take all in once you watch this film,especially as it repeats itself when Leopold goes back to his world and he has to relive the previous day all over again.VerdictA nice heartfelt,harmless fantasy that will leave a sense of love and warmth after you have seen it and stars a very charming man indeed.Rating B- 6.9\/10A feel good movieEdited on 25\/03\/2016 as I seen it last night and I had to tweak the review for it.

In the fleeting conversation of any chauffeur, taxi driver or leading guardian with his or her passenger in the classically domineering tone of which Jessica Tandy's character has supposedly trademarked.I was naturally reluctant to pick this movie out of the possible thousands of well-known 'classic's I have not had the fortune to behold &#x96; and thereafter judge or scrutinise following the seemingly over-hyped reminiscence of it, left by the ardent and passionate fans of such work; But now after watching it, to me its come to light that this film is much more than the pretentious banter of an upper-class woman to which her abiding driver must hear.Set in Atlanta, Georgia in 1948, 72-year-old Jewish Widow, and proudly self-dependant Daisy Werthan lives alone in her well-kept house - with only her reliant housemaid Idella. Being her age, as much as she would deny, her senses just don't serve her as well as they once did. Prior to this realisation, she unfortunately drives her Chrysler in the wrong gear and subsequently over a ledge, rendering it totalled.Her dependable son Boolie (Played by Dan Aykroyd) is well aware that no insurance company would insure her, and so much his prediction served correctly. He therefore proposes that he should hire a chauffeur for his mother to go about her daily errands and social visits. Of course - and soon understandably - she is reluctant of this, from fear of being perceived as either too old to drive or so wealthy so that she is able to publicly flaunt it with a chauffeur.Despite her obvious dissent, Boolie goes ahead and hires an elder Hoke Colburn (Morgan Freeman) to carry out the task of driving his mother.

But as Sherlock Holmes would say there is method in the seeming randomness of the Horseman and his victims. It's quite the convoluted plot that brews in Sleepy Hollow.

Great Gothic sets, I think Burton was inspired by some of the horror classics that Universal used to do back in the days of the studio system.In addition to those already mentioned, Michael Gambon and Miranda Richardson as Mr.&Mrs. Van Tassel, Michael Gough as the village notary and in flashback Christopher Walken as the Horseman before he went headless should all be singled out.Sleepy Hollow is a well done film and even though it is more Tim Burton than Washington Irving it will give you more than a few frights.

Chan's next Police Story film, New Police Story, would be a new generation film to the series and released in 2004. As we all know Jackie Chan is probably the best martial arts actor on screen next to Bruce Lee. Chan took fighting sequences as we know it and made them so much more entertaining. Including prop fights and fights in so many cool places. An example of cool creative Chan fight scene would be in this one where Jackie battles Russian Maufia henchmen UNDER WATER ! With sharks !! Later in the review I will clarify on the US cuts of Jackie's films.Chan-Kai Ku returns again, and this time he's not battling gangs in Hong Kong or its surrounding areas, he's now an international agent trying to stop the illegal selling of uranium bombs. This could lead to the end of the world as we know it. At first Chan is supposed to just keep track of a girl on a plane, but then he ends up getting caught up with the Russian Maufia who later betrays him. As the plot unravels more and more, impressive action sequences do surface such as a snow mobile and helicopter chase (cut from the US version), a prop fight with ladders,brooms, and sticks, and to a climatic under water fight ! Wow !I have to admit, this film is more of a drama than martial arts film, therefore is quite different from the previous Police Story films. The US version is by no means worth getting after seeing the uncut version. Even though New Line Cinema's DVD of this is only $5, after viewing the uncut (which only surfaced on the Japanese laser disc,VCD disc,DVD, and the Taiwanese DVD as well.) you will realize you've never been swindled out of $5 so bad in your entire life time.The US cuts Jackie Chan first gained stardom with his first big film in Asia, The Drunken Master (1978). Chan then went onto gain even more international stardom with Police Story (1985). Chan had made a bunch of films in the US, but never made it famous here until his 1995 film, Rumble in The Bronx. I hate it when this happens, America acts like they've discovered something big and great and they're the first ones who knew about it. Joke's on them ! Jackie had already been famous for over 20 years before his big LATE US debut. This is also when the popular rumor of Chan doing every single one of his stunts began. Its a lie people, not a fact. Jackie DOES MOST OF HIS OWN STUNTS.....not all. Anyways, New Line Cinema in the mid-90s seemed to be the US film company that bought most of Jackie's films (Dimension owned and released a few, but nowhere near as much as New Line), such as Police Story 1 & 2, and was the distributor to the US for Chan's most recent films. It seems as if New Line Cinema's editors are very underpaid, so they practically chopped up and edited so much up of Jackie's movies its unbearable. One common practice is adding a main title sequence. In most Hong Kong films there really is no opening credits, but just the film's title and the main star along with the director etc. But here a whole title sequence is made, as well as changing the film's score. These are New Line's attempts at Americanizing Chan's movies. But, isn't that the whole point of foreign films ? To watch them as they are ?! Plus, watching New Line's disgraceful edits is an insult to the film makers since they've worked so hard on this project and then stuff gets changed and torn out, so you're not watching it the way it was intended. Some of New Line's biggest edits are on First Strike, Mr. Nice Guy, and Rumble in The Bronx ! Mr. Nice Guy for example was released here in US theatres in its original uncut 113 minute length, but when New Line released the DVD they CHOPPED IT DOWN TO ONLY 84 MINUTES ! Woah !!! These companies have so much control, that they actually have had the US edits have world wide distribution ! So now the uncut dvds are virtually impossible to find !!!! Even in Asia the cut US dvds are the most popular to find ! ASS !!! Another thing is the dubbing. New Line's dubbing is done way better than Dimension's dubbing. In First Strike its very interesting. The film was originally shot with a bunch of languages since, Chan is an international agent in this one. I mean that, Jackie Chan speaks English, Cantonese and Mandarin throughout the movie, while the Russians of course speak Russian as well as English. But in the US version everyone speaks English. So in the part where the Russian agent and the Chinese agent talking through their computers makes more sense, since the Chinese guy can't speak Russian, and the Russians can't speak Chinese. The US version you'll find yourself confused. 'well, if they both speak English why can't they just talk to each other ?' Another strange dubbing detail I noticed was that some of the characters who speak English in the movie are re-dubbed anyways to maybe hide their accents. In some cases very bad Russian stereotype voices. Hey, New Line ! I have an idea, for Jackie's next movie why not just make it run only an hour and make Jackie look like a white guy so he appeals more to stupid Americans!! ! Maybe that's better !

Chan's next Police Story film, New Police Story, would be a new generation film to the series and released in 2004. As we all know Jackie Chan is probably the best martial arts actor on screen next to Bruce Lee. Chan took fighting sequences as we know it and made them so much more entertaining. Including prop fights and fights in so many cool places. An example of cool creative Chan fight scene would be in this one where Jackie battles Russian Maufia henchmen UNDER WATER ! With sharks !! Later in the review I will clarify on the US cuts of Jackie's films.Chan-Kai Ku returns again, and this time he's not battling gangs in Hong Kong or its surrounding areas, he's now an international agent trying to stop the illegal selling of uranium bombs. This could lead to the end of the world as we know it. At first Chan is supposed to just keep track of a girl on a plane, but then he ends up getting caught up with the Russian Maufia who later betrays him. As the plot unravels more and more, impressive action sequences do surface such as a snow mobile and helicopter chase (cut from the US version), a prop fight with ladders,brooms, and sticks, and to a climatic under water fight ! Wow !I have to admit, this film is more of a drama than martial arts film, therefore is quite different from the previous Police Story films. The US version is by no means worth getting after seeing the uncut version. Even though New Line Cinema's DVD of this is only $5, after viewing the uncut (which only surfaced on the Japanese laser disc,VCD disc,DVD, and the Taiwanese DVD as well.) you will realize you've never been swindled out of $5 so bad in your entire life time.The US cuts Jackie Chan first gained stardom with his first big film in Asia, The Drunken Master (1978). Chan then went onto gain even more international stardom with Police Story (1985). Chan had made a bunch of films in the US, but never made it famous here until his 1995 film, Rumble in The Bronx. I hate it when this happens, America acts like they've discovered something big and great and they're the first ones who knew about it. Joke's on them ! Jackie had already been famous for over 20 years before his big LATE US debut. This is also when the popular rumor of Chan doing every single one of his stunts began. Its a lie people, not a fact. Jackie DOES MOST OF HIS OWN STUNTS.....not all. Anyways, New Line Cinema in the mid-90s seemed to be the US film company that bought most of Jackie's films (Dimension owned and released a few, but nowhere near as much as New Line), such as Police Story 1 & 2, and was the distributor to the US for Chan's most recent films. It seems as if New Line Cinema's editors are very underpaid, so they practically chopped up and edited so much up of Jackie's movies its unbearable. One common practice is adding a main title sequence. In most Hong Kong films there really is no opening credits, but just the film's title and the main star along with the director etc. But here a whole title sequence is made, as well as changing the film's score. These are New Line's attempts at Americanizing Chan's movies. But, isn't that the whole point of foreign films ? To watch them as they are ?! Plus, watching New Line's disgraceful edits is an insult to the film makers since they've worked so hard on this project and then stuff gets changed and torn out, so you're not watching it the way it was intended.

What struck me most about this film is really how well it has stood the test of time. It was in fact even better than I ever remember it being. It is better than I had any right to expect. Somehow, I think they managed to get every element just right. The cinematography is epic with huge panaromas of the outback wastelands of Oz. Some of the shots are so wide you can actually see the curvature of the earth. The characters and costumes are timeless, gritty and disturbing and though it's pretty over the top it manages to avoid feeling camp and stays menacing. I think the gay biker vigilantes in bondage gear have only become more terrifying as I've gotten older and will continue to do so. The road chase action sequences are just the best. All done for real and it pays off, you really appreciate the speed and danger of it all. The orchestral score is also a triumph. There's not much dialogue to worry about and what there is doesn't detract. Some of it is even really funny. And the cars, oh the cars are glorious. The root of this films success though is Max, the quintessential nihilist wandering the wastelands and the fact that Max is so long gone he wants nothing from anyone, he won't let anyone near him. At least Travis Bickle had a plan, an aim. There's a beautiful girl, Max ignores her until she is pierced with a crossbow and lies bleeding on some barbed wire. Max doesn't flinch. The Paradise that they are heading for, Max knows it doesn't exist. He meets people who try and befriend him, he deletes them from his facebook. Max has really had enough. The only flicker of humanity shows in Max's relationship with the so credited feral kid, whom is revealed as narrator right at the last moment. The credits rolled and I had to sit and take a moment. I had to watch it again the next day and enjoyed it even more. I just love everything about Mad Max 2. This film is more than just a kitsch cult item, it's a bonafide classic of the genre.

This stage of life is neither sad nor pathetic, but two people facing together life's sometimes cruel fate.We see through a series of flashbacks how they met and forged a lifelong relationship. The younger Iris and John are performed by Kate Winslet and Hugh Bonneville, as a fun-loving couple cycling through the countryside and going for swims off the nearest riverbank. Iris was a worldly woman involved with multiple male partners and John, a late-bloomer with a stutter, who doted on the gorgeous young Iris. Eventually, Iris settled into her role as a national literary figure, giving interviews and speeches in which beautifully crafted sentences rolled off her tongue. Then, rather suddenly, she was stricken with Alzeimer's disease.I was reminded of my own grandparents' fight with Alzeimer's as I watched Judi Dench in Iris Murdoch's character. Like my grandmother, Iris lost contact with reality and life ceased to make sense to her; yet, there were moments when she let us know that she still treasured those who cared for her. Physically strong and able to go for long walks, Iris had stamina that far surpassed her capacity to understand. These are the cruel ironies of Alzeimer's disease.

The film is based on John Bayley's book of the real-life struggle which he and his famous literary wife endured. This stage of life is neither sad nor pathetic, but two people facing together life's sometimes cruel fate.We see through a series of flashbacks how they met and forged a lifelong relationship. The younger Iris and John are performed by Kate Winslet and Hugh Bonneville, as a fun-loving couple cycling through the countryside and going for swims off the nearest riverbank. Iris was a worldly woman involved with multiple male partners and John, a late-bloomer with a stutter, who doted on the gorgeous young Iris. Eventually, Iris settled into her role as a national literary figure, giving interviews and speeches in which beautifully crafted sentences rolled off her tongue. Then, rather suddenly, she was stricken with Alzeimer's disease.I was reminded of my own grandparents' fight with Alzeimer's as I watched Judi Dench in Iris Murdoch's character. Like my grandmother, Iris lost contact with reality and life ceased to make sense to her; yet, there were moments when she let us know that she still treasured those who cared for her.

Based on the confessions of serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, this is a near biographical film mixing in some fictional elements, and all the way drawing you in. Basically Henry (Cliffhanger's Michael Rooker) has a hobby for murder, whenever he is having some kind of distress or wants cheering up he will kill any random person. Henry stays on the move to avoid capture, but always returns to his flat with his old prison cell-mate Otis (Tom Towles), Henry was serving time in prison for killing his own mother with no remorse. Moving in their flat is Otis's sister Becky (Tracy Arnold) who is completely oblivious to the deadly crimes Henry is committing, she is starting to fall for him, with his good manners and looking out for her. Over some nights of drinking beer, Henry introduces Otis to his hobby when looking for a new TV and killing the salesman, and then a few prostitutes. There is no limit to how violent Henry and the now addicted to killing Otis get during their sprees, they enjoy filming their hideous acts with the camcorder as well. Otis is becoming really off the wall recently, and when he tries to make a move on Becky, his own sister, she makes a stab, and Henry has no choice but to finish him off. The couple get rid of the body and move on to avoid the police tailing them, but even Henry can't resist getting a little bit of action with Becky, not having sex with her, but killing her and just dumping her. Also starring Mary Demas as Dead Woman \/ Dead Prostitute \/ Hooker #1, Anne Bartoletti as Waitress, Elizabeth Kaden and Ted Kaden as Dead Couple and Denise Sullivan as Floating Woman. Instead of going for the typical sophisticated and devilish villain serial killer, the simplistic Rooker is a good step away from convention, Towles is a good co-murderer with his crazy streak, and Arnold has her moments as the unknowing female roommate. It has fifteen murders in whole, you see a reasonable amount of gory moments to compliment, and there is a disturbing moment involving risqué voyeurism, I can see what the critics mean by a documentary feel, it is a great chilling modernised psychological horror. Very good!

He was inspired then to one day fly like the pilots he could see from his bedroom window. As an adult he left home and followed his dream, training in the U.S. air force. Soon after in 1966, Dieter was shot down over Laos flying his first ever mission. He was tortured and starved extensively by his captors as were other U.S. prisoners at the same camp. Miraculously, Dieter not only survived the starvation but he eventually escaped barefoot and was later rescued.This is Dieters story and Little Dieter needs to fly is the documentary. Here we see Dieter in conversation, in interview, at home and at play, but he is also taken back into the Laotian jungle to relive and reenact his capture. This really helps to illustrate not only his own war stories but also Herzog's own story about Dieter, as Dieter is deeply disturbed by the experience. These stories are told within the context of Dieters whole life and you really get to know him by the end. I think due to his improvising and adventurous nature each Herzog film is very much unique. The pacing, the edit and his relationship with his subject is always changing. By the films conclusion I must admit I was all choked up, it's an extraordinary story and a really fine film that will be watched for years to come.
