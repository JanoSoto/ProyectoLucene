Also, they were westerns. But there's nothing distinctly Italian about spaghetti westerns... except maybe the flair for spectacular overacting.As a genre, it reached its peak in the mid-60s, even though it was still relatively young at the time. Today it's misunderstood, made fun of, or loved. Which is okay that makes it like just about every other genre of film, thus validating its cultural significance.None of the spaghetti westerns are more significant, though, than Sergio Leone's. His Man with No Name Trilogy is much beleaguered and loved today, as is the underwhelming Once Upon a Time in the West, a film most memorable for featuring Henry Fonda as a villain. But of the Trilogy, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly -- the third installment that is actually the most basic of the three -- is something miraculous. The movie's tagline was For three men, the Civil War wasn't Hell -- it was practice! While that may seem like a silly tagline, the movie is not The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, Dr. Strangelove, and Pulp Fiction each go down in my book as the greatest cool movies of all time.But you may be asking how does a western, shot in Spain with an entire cast speaking only Spanish except for the principle three stars, directed by an Italian with a fetish for the Civil War, with hardly any dialogue and a plot with more holes in it than the fishnet your local deli makes its employees wear -- well, how does that work? Quite simply... I don't know. I just know that The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is one of the best times I've ever had watching a movie. The plot revolves around $200,000 in gold coins. Blondie (Clint Eastwood, and the Good in the title) is after it, as are Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef, the Bad) and Tuco (Eli Wallach, the Ugly). That's the plot. Yeah, really.Sergio Leone is famous for his camera direction, his quick cut close-ups with alternating wide shots. Here is no different. In fact, it's remarkable to note how few regular shots are used -- or, if they are more common than I perceived, how well the close-ups and wide shots are executed so as to draw attention to themselves.Equally famous is the way in which Leone could drag out a showdown. While nothing in this film quite matches the incredible 15-minute standoff from Once Upon a Time in the West, it is still fun to watch the final sequence, as the three square off to see who would live long enough to find the gold coins.But more than these trademarks -- how about that score? Ennio Morricone, whose work is vastly under-appreciated and is pigeonholed too easily, created a theme here that is simultaneously catchy, memorable, and chilling.So maybe that's it. What makes The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly work is the expressive combination of the genius of each individual, wildly-varying ingredient of this pasta gumbo.

Basically, if you are a fan of the original Halloween, you can forget about everything that made that movie a classic. The great theme-song by Carpenter is gone, and so is Michael Myers and Jamie Lee Curtis. I just can't figure out what the creators where thinking when they came up with this... Its like making a James Bond movie without James Bond. Or better yet; a Friday the 13th movie without Jason. It is doomed to fail and this movie rightfully did so because this is a stain on the horrorgenre and incorporates NO entertainment value at all.What you get instead, is this weird plot about haunted Halloween-masks. It isn't exactly scary what so ever, and the stunningly bad acting doesn't help either. And if you thought it was already bad that the movie doesn't include the original Halloween-score, then you will be even more amazed by the fact that this has been replaced with the most terrible annoying pieces of music ever that plays on commercials throughout the film. It has been composed to give you a headache and if you completely watched this piece of junk it will make you wish you've never layed eyes on this awful movie. Trust me when I say that it goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on.On top of that, the horror-element is also very shallow. So fans of gore and splatter can skip this movie right away. Season of the Witch (I'm not even going to call it Halloween 3) is also one of the most boring pieces of film-making I have ever witnessed. And just when you thought maybe the creators saved the best for last you will be confronted with one of the most shitty endings in movie-history, and all the hope you initially had for this garbage is crushed. Its like the creators just ran out of money and wrote the ending in 5 sentences or so. It pisses me off to no end and does not satisfy the viewers endurance for this film what so ever. It only makes you feel ripped off, and thats just what this is; a rip-off.Don't even think about renting it for fun either, because its not. Its not one of those hilarious bad B-movies, this is just plain mediocre and boring. It includes no humour what so ever, it has one of the most uninspired dialogs ever, and more importantly it signed the deathmark of Halloween as a series. Stay away!

Its like making a James Bond movie without James Bond. Or better yet; a Friday the 13th movie without Jason. It is doomed to fail and this movie rightfully did so because this is a stain on the horrorgenre and incorporates NO entertainment value at all.What you get instead, is this weird plot about haunted Halloween-masks. It isn't exactly scary what so ever, and the stunningly bad acting doesn't help either. And if you thought it was already bad that the movie doesn't include the original Halloween-score, then you will be even more amazed by the fact that this has been replaced with the most terrible annoying pieces of music ever that plays on commercials throughout the film. It has been composed to give you a headache and if you completely watched this piece of junk it will make you wish you've never layed eyes on this awful movie. Trust me when I say that it goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on.On top of that, the horror-element is also very shallow. So fans of gore and splatter can skip this movie right away. Season of the Witch (I'm not even going to call it Halloween 3) is also one of the most boring pieces of film-making I have ever witnessed. And just when you thought maybe the creators saved the best for last you will be confronted with one of the most shitty endings in movie-history, and all the hope you initially had for this garbage is crushed. Its like the creators just ran out of money and wrote the ending in 5 sentences or so. It pisses me off to no end and does not satisfy the viewers endurance for this film what so ever. It only makes you feel ripped off, and thats just what this is; a rip-off.Don't even think about renting it for fun either, because its not. Its not one of those hilarious bad B-movies, this is just plain mediocre and boring.

Probably because at that time (the eighties) cinema movies seldomly reached past 120 minutes. In theory, a fast paced movie is a good thing. It won't bore your audience to death.,In case of Frank Herbert's Dune, you lose so much of the background story, you end up with a fast paced story nobody understand.Frank Herbert 's Dune was deemed unfilmable. I disagree. It is unfilmable in 90 to 120 minute film. Like Tolkiens LOTR. I think both books share something in common. Their world is so rich, not only in events but in information that these books have long been seen as unfilmable. I think Peter Jackson proved everybody wrong (though he made some dubious plot changes and decisions in the Two Towers). Books as these are so rich, you need to take as much time as you need to tell the story. Another example is Eragon. By trying to stay within the 100 minute limit, you get the book in fast-forward view!Back to Dune I fell in love with this movie, because loved the acting, sets, costumes, general atmosphere. It is Dune come to life. And I read the book first. By having read the book first, I knew all there is to know. And the movie goes down easily.

Either filmmakers try to repeat the success of the first one by just giving the same thing but on that bigger and better scale but it just doesn't have the magic as the first. Or you get into rare sequels like Terminator 2 and my favorite Aliens which surpass the original. Here, it's likable but then you find reasons to hate it. Ian Malcolm has spent the last 4 years telling people who will listen the horrors that happened at Isla Nublar but no one will believe him, including when some big conglomerate bigwigs step in. He meets with Jurassic Park founder and former Ingen boss John Hammond who informs him of Site B, a kind of pre-breeding ground before being shipped to the park. But in order to not have Ingen take the dinosaurs away from the island, he sends a reluctant-but-then-determined Malcolm to the island, especially when news that his girlfriend Sarah is on the island alone. So coming along with Malcolm is Nick, a photographer and Eddie, a field equipment expert and Malcolm's stowaway adopted daughter Kelly. Only they run into Ingen's team who wants to take the dinosaurs away back to the States. After a rather harrowing(and suspenseful) incident, they team up to try to escape the island, which then leads to dinosaur vs. city at the end. Steven Spielberg when he does blockbuster films is best when it gets your heart pounding and gets the suspense going. The raptor in the kitchen scene or when T-Rex escapes are some of the better suspenseful moments from the first one. Oddly enough, there's 2 here.

In three hours Ben-Hur only lapses a couple of times into rather wishy-washy melodrama. Otherwise director William Wyler has presented a forceful, strikingly visual film about a Jewish man's quest for vengeance, and the way in which he gains that recompense.Ben-Hur opens by telling us it is a tale of the Christ. Misleading really, considering only a handful of references are made to Jesus. Why the story of our Lord was tied in is a mystery, and seemingly not necessary. Perhaps Karl Turnberg (screenwriter) was trying hard to be true to the original novel. Certainly the focus is not on forgiveness, though love having the power to set you free and love being stronger than hate are central themes.As I have said, the film looks awesome. The enormous sets are lavish, contributing to an overall production design that is second to none. Cinematography goes one better, with several knockout scenes culminating in the legendary chariot race, which lives up to its billing as the most spectacular chase of all time.The cast are strong too, with the forceful presence of Charlton Heston a big factor. Support from Stephen Boyd (as Messala) and Jack Hawkins (as adoptive father Quitus Arrius) is good too.
