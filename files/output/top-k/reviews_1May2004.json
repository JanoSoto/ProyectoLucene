[{"date":"1 May 2004","score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":"  Naked Gun and South Park brain trusts (that's a good) come together for this silly, rude and ultimately shallow parody-styled bomb as two losers (Trey Parker and Matt Stone) come up with the titled athletic activity (a strange combination of baseball and basketball). The typical stuff happens as the sport actually becomes a national phenomena that lures people in with its wackiness. Crazed situations and dumb results end up being the calling card. Jenny McCarthy and Yasmine Bleeth are the hot babes, Ernest Borgnine and Robert Vaughn are the established performers and over-rated media sports figures Al Michaels and Bob Costas are the cameo players in the disjointed venture. Nothing really too interesting happens and we are left with junior high-type antics that will only interest those with nothing on their minds and even less on their would-be busy schedules. 2 stars out of 5.

Disney's hopelessly unfunny live-action feature based on the &#145;60s cartoon. For what he's given, Leslie Nielsen (of THE NAKED GUN movies, who always tries) is ideally cast as the lovably nearsighted, clueless tycoon caught in a needlessly complicated and dragged-out plot concerning Magoo's accidental robbery of a precious ruby and the ruthless jewel thieves that are after it. With a lot of slapstick pratfalls and lame vision-impaired situations thrown in, the movie's biggest problem is that there's nothing funny-and hammers every joke flat. The animated opening and closing moments are the best because they feature the voice of the former Mr. Magoo, Jim Backus. Running Time 85 minutes and rated PG for mild cartoon violence. * ½   ","genre":null},{"date":"1 May 2004","score":"3 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":"  Mr. Magoo (1997) Leslie Nielsen, Kelly Lynch, Matt Keeslar, Nick Chinlund, Stephen Tobolowsky, Ernie Hudson, Jennifer Garner, Malcolm McDowell, D Stanley Tong.
