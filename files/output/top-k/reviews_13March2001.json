The main character spends most of the movie's dreadfully long running time alone on a desolate island-but we determined from trailers and TV ads that the character is retrieved after four years, which kind of eliminates the tension of whether or not he will get off the island alive. Tom Hanks plays Nick Noland, a systems engineer for Federal Express who intends to wed his long time girlfriend, Kelley (Helen Hunt), after he returns from a business trip over the south Pacific. We are not surprised when his plane encounters a horrible storm. During one of the most intensely convincing crash sequences ever made, the aircraft plummets into the ocean below, miles off course. Nick is the sole survivor, finding a resting place on a deserted tropical island. Time passes, he builds shelter, losses hope, but nonetheless survives.  If you are not aware of his eventual rescue after four years, then you are not among the movies target audience. The story really focuses on Nick starting his life over and overcoming extreme odds. He finds out that Kelley became married and the rest of society has assumed his death. Nick's determination is encouraging, but the movie needs more detailing survival on the island. The scenes on the island are the movies best. The film is very careful not to become idle. There are constantly new situations and conflicts being introduced, even though their scenes are often slow moving and tedious. Tom Hanks does an exceptional job as the only real character in the film, all other's are plot devices. There are a few attempts to introduce side characters, but in a movie like this that is nearly impossible, although the actors do a reasonable job with what little screen time they behold.Director Robert Zemekis stays focused on a consistent narrative instead of going back and forth between characters, like the mediocre Six Days, Seven Nights. This is a thought-provoking situation, but most of us already know how the plot concludes. The actual conclusion itself is actually dissatisfying and inconclusive. Cast Away is still a good production, well made, and beautifully crafted. I liked the directors consistent style and focused narrative, the plane crash sequence, and I give the film a marginal recommendation.

But many years on, I have grown to love what it is all about. In fact, I now laugh at what I guess I was so scared off. Gremlins are creatures that are meant to scare and humour the audience at the same time.Don't ever get it wet. Keep it away from bright light. And no matter how much it cries, no matter how much it begs...never, ever feed it after midnight. With these instructions, young Billy Peltzer takes possession of his new cuddly pet, a gift from his father. But Billy will get a whole lot more than he bargained for and the small quite town of Kingston Falls is in for a Christmas they will never forget!  The first point I want to discuss about this movie is that of the great story behind it. It was very original and one that I liked. I enjoyed the idea of little menacing creatures causing havoc in an innocent little town, and the way that the Gremlins just take over. At the start of this film, the audience is aware that with the cute pet Gizmo (a Mogwai), comes much responsibility. I love the fact that there are three rules attached. If you break them, then all hell will break lose. It is an interesting concept and one I must say that worked. I feel that there has been some movies which have tried to copy the Gremlins concept which don't even come close. The Critters (and there sequels) for example, were a poor attempt in trying to follow on from the Gremlins.The human cast of Gremlins was a pretty good one. The well known person from the Gremlins for me is the gorgeous Phoebe Cates. Her character in this film is full of hurt and regret, which the audience I am sure feel sorry for, plus she also helps save the day. I recently saw her very first movie, Fast times at Ridgemont High. That was a one hell of a teenage film. Cates looked stunning in it as well. Playing the lead role of Billy Peltzer was Zach Galligan. Zach has hardly been heard of since the role of Billy in Gremlins (and the sequel). Yet I seem to ask myself the question, why? He was excellent in Gremlins and a good choice as the main character. I guess he has done some other movie which have been flops. This includes the 1994 comedy All Tied Up, starring the stunning Terri Hatcher.It's now time to talk about the real &#145;stars' of this show. Yes, those little green monsters. All credit needs to go to puppet makers in the Gremlins. These &#145;things' looked so real. Special comment needs to go to the creator of the &#145;Stripe' Gremlin. He was an amazing character. I want to say that the character of Gizmo was very restricted. We hardly ever see the whole animal. I liked him much more the second time around. The Gremlins is a movie that has so much happen in a little time. While these creatures remain &#145;Mogwais', they are quite harmless, but once they turn into the gruesome Gremlins they cause disaster after disaster. The scene in the school was quite satirical, with the Gremlin having his revenge on the school teacher. The only criticism of this scene is that we never actually find out what happens to that Gremlin. I guess he eventually meets up with whole group, but how does the viewing audience know this? Then we have the hilarious scene at the Peltzer household. The mother was quite game tackling those gruesome creatures. I love it when she blends one in the mixer and then fries one in the microwave. When Stripe escapes, he hurts the small town of Kingston Falls. The scene at the YMCA swimming pool was clever. Then when you see all the Gremlins walking into town you appreciate that they are not real. Then you have the pub scene where Kate is trapped serving all these mischievous characters, it was totally wild. Also the scene with the snow plough going through the Futterman's house was crazy and suits the Gremlins totally. By the end we see one of the great pieces of directing, seeing all the Gremlins in the cinema watching quite a tame film in Snow White. Plus the final battle between Billy and Stripe in the Supermarket. It is so clever to see the little Gremlin tackle Billy with a chainsaw and a bow and arrow. Plus we see the best scene with Gizmo here. He is driving a Barbie-doll car, which was cute. I wont describe the end, but I will say that it was quite gut wrenching.Credit must go to the director and producer of Gremlins. Steven Spielberg is a genius and one of the best producers in the business. His other movies which I have loved include E.T., The Goonies, and Jurassic Park. I also enjoyed the directing of Joe Dante. He was very inventive and takes us on a wild  roller-coaster ride with the Gremlins. To say that the original Gremlins film is a favourite of mine is an understatement. This movie is full of cuteness, cleverness, mischievousness and intelligence, all rolled into one. I also remember the posters advertising the Gremlins in this country (Australia). It was a Gremlin peeking out of a toilet. When I saw that I just had to see it, even though I did get nightmares after doing so. So, if you're air conditioner goes on the fritz, or washing machine blows up, or your video recorder konks out, before you call the repairman, turn on all the lights and check under all the beds, cos you never can tell, there just might be a Gremlin in your house!Rating 4 Stars or 9\/10.

The only thing that confused me until this night was the mention of a daughter, whom I'd never seen; I thought he had two sons, but it turned out that what I thought was the younger son was the daughter.Oops.Other than that, what could there be to hate (or at least intensely dislike) about this movie?  A nice, sweet, sensitive guy named Christy (played excellently by Robin Williams) meets the love of his life, they get married, have some kids, and (as is LIFE), tragedies and mid-life crises occur down the road.  In this case, first it's by losing the kids, and FOUR (not ONE) years later, Christy's life is taken away ... both from himself and the love of his life.At first, he can't accept it and he tries to comfort his wife as she tries to get through the fact that she's lost yet another and therefore, ALL her loves.  As Christy sees, this only worsens things for her, so he leaves and finds comfort in a place he felt he would be comfortable to spend eternity in when he was alive The landscapes of her paintings mixed in with his own bliss.Through Christy's journey through His Own Private Heaven, he's guided first by his son (taking the form of someone who PERSONIFIED someone he knew his father trusted with his life).  Eventually, Christy meets his daughter again (taking the form of what she knew PERSONIFIED what her father respected in a woman).  And here, I guess, comes the message that Christy is fine with who he is and is therefore why he retains his own shape and likeness.Amazing graphics for the heavens.  God's Heaven, Christy's heaven, as well as the individual heavens for each of his kids.But, when Christy finds out that his wife killed herself and is now in Her Own Private Hell for the rest of eternity, he does all he can to find her and get her back and reconcile with the entire family.Of course, the images of Hell are disturbing, to say the very least (The sea of faces and the thought of being buried up to my head so only my face sticks out FOR THE REST OF ETERNITY really got to me).  But all I can say for those who thought it was too disturbing is Well, DUH!  It's HELL!  A place of eternal torment and discomfort, etc.  And, for those who are reading this who've attempted suicide, failed, and might have been offended by the Hell for Suicides message, I think all it was saying was that death wouldn't take the mental and emotional pain away; you take whatever you were feeling before you died with you.All in all, we have a movie that depicts the romance of going through terrible things to spend eternity with our loved ones.  The same kind of romance that has been told in every love song and\/or poem, every pillow talk, every wedding vow, every one-night-stand scam, and everything that everyone has ever tried to put to words what they explain to be Love depicted on the screen.Along with that, we have a small message from Whomever-Dreamed-Up-This-Story that DOESN'T say that you deserve eternal torment because you committed suicide, but that succeeding in doing the deed will not take the problems away because you take whatever you died with WITH YOU.Christy took Positive with him; his wife took Negative.

Murnau began the first film adaptation of Bram Stoker's `Dracula,' and it soon became, not only one of the most celebrated horror films of all time, but the stuff of which legends are born.  Denied the rights to the book, Murnau merely changed the title to `Nosferatu,' Count Dracula became Count `Orlok,' and filming began.  `Shadow of the Vampire,' directed by E. Elias Merhige, is a chronicle of the making of the film, one which blends fact and fiction and successfully exploits the myth surrounding the entire project.  Fueling the fires of mystery that permeated the set was the fact that method\/character actor Max Schreck, who played Count Orlok, was never seen by anyone without his makeup, which gave him a look that was a bit disconcerting to say the least.  And, according to this film, Murnau added to it all by confiding that Schreck was actually a real vampire playing an actor playing a vampire.  In any case, the atmosphere created by Murnau as they filmed `Nosferatu' certainly did the trick, as did the dark, unsettling aura created and maintained throughout by Merhige with this film. \tJohn Malkovich does an excellent job of bringing Murnau to life, giving him that sense of someone just slightly off-center; an unusual artist making a decidedly unusual film.  Malkovich's Murnau is a determined and adamant filmmaker who has the ability to stay in the moment, and whose philosophy is that `Anything beyond the frame doesn't exist.'  An interesting concept from one of the three most highly regarded German filmmakers of the time.  As Schreck\/Orlok, Willem Dafoe gives an amazing performance that completely captures the essence of the man and his most famous on-screen character.  Off screen as well, Dafoe applied Schreck's method of only allowing himself to be seen in full make-up by cast and crew as they filmed, and the desired effect is fully realized-- by the other characters, as well as the audience-- in the anticipation of his first appearance in the film, which when it comes is cast in shadows that distort his figure while emphasizing his elongated fingers and nails.  It's quite an image, and does indeed create an indelible impression.  Merhige's approach not only works well, but is brilliant in conception and execution, evoking a dark sense of disquietude while sustaining the enigma of his actor\/vampire.  And the B&W rushes of `Nosferatu,' as well as the glimpses `through' the lens we get as they film it, have an authentic look that further captures that sense of time and place that gives this film credibility and makes it so believable.  Most of the film takes place `on set,' or at least in the proximity thereof, and the atmosphere created by Merhige draws you in and makes you a part of it all; it gives you the feeling of actually `being there.' \tThe terrific supporting cast includes Cary Elwes (Fritz), Udo Kier (Albin Grau), Eddie Izzard (Gustav), Aden Gillett (Henrick), Ronan Vibert (Wolfgang) and Catherine McCormack (Greta).  Extremely well crafted and presented by Merhige, with a number of memorable performances (especially Dafoe's), `Shadow of the Vampire' is a rare treat to be experienced and savored.  It's a dark film, but not depressingly so, delivered with intelligence and just enough humor to offset the drama, as when Schreck at one point says to Murnau, `I don't think we need the writer anymore.'  A classic line from a film that I am sure will in time be considered a classic in it's own right.  An engrossing behind-the-scenes look at the creative process that makes the magic of the movies a reality, and for film buffs especially, it is one that must not be missed.  I rate this one 9\/10.

The movie doesn't care at all about the previous movies. As if it is not a sequel. It doesn't care about the way Highlander I ended and that is bad.2. The movie is sort of divided in two.

Adrian Paul is normal - a decent actor i could say - but Lambert is sooo bad, that i can't even express it in words. So far away of the great role he played in Gideon...4. Very predictable.

The movie doesn't care at all about the previous movies. As if it is not a sequel. It doesn't care about the way Highlander I ended and that is bad.2. The movie is sort of divided in two. In the first part we don't get to find out too much about the plot, all we have are flashbacks of Connor and Duncan. Only around the halfway point we find out what it's actually about a really really bad guy and the fight Connor and Duncan have to lead against him.3. The acting is very bad. Adrian Paul is normal - a decent actor i could say - but Lambert is sooo bad, that i can't even express it in words. So far away of the great role he played in Gideon...4. Very predictable. You know what will happen next throughout the whole movie. Example when we're introduced to the bad guy, we find out that he has killed 661 immortals so far. That moment, i told the friends that i watched this movie with, that he will kill 5 more until the end. I was right. And this is just ONE of the many possible examples.5. (the most important thing, this is why i left it for the end)   The ending. The ending is sooooo bad and again soooo predictable.....  I guess i should worn you right now that there might be some spoilers ahead. But WHAT spoilers can there be when you know how it will end from the beginning?? Anyway, i'll follow the rules SPOILERS AHEAD.So the ending. I still can't believe how come these people aren't sick yet of these endings. The sacrifice for defeating the evil. The death of someone close to the main character. The final fight good vs evil. The evil starts well and kicks the good guy's ass. The good guy is almost defeated. The evil guy lets the good guy know about the fact he killed a close person. The good guy miraculously gets better and kicks the evil guy's ass. For good.Does it ring a bell? Of course it does. Almost every movie with fights ends like this. And although i hoped this would be different, i was wrong.All in all, a bad film, that i recommend only to stupid people or the real maniacs about Highlander. But i am sure that even the biggest Highlander fans will be disappointed.

Naturally the book is better. I have never seen a movie that has been better then the book. The plot was good and stuck pretty close to the book. Some things were different and some things were left out but it still flowed and made sense. The only thing was that the characters weren't as developed as they could have been. In the book you really get to feel for the them. It's still like that in the movie but not as much.The acting was wonderful. C.

For Rob Reiner's spot-on satire of the rock and roll industry is presented in mock documentary form, so it is really a rockumentary mockumentary.   Film director Marty di Bergi (Reiner) decides to make a film which chronicles the ups and downs of his favourite rock band, Britain's own Spinal Tap, who are about to embark upon a comeback tour to promote their new album Smell The Glove (previous albums included Intravenus de Milo; The Gospel According To Spinal Tap and Shark Sandwich).  The band consists of five members; Nigel Tufnel, lead guitar (Guest), David St. Hubbins, lead guitar\/vocals (McKean), Derek Smalls, bass guitar (Shearer) and the three central characters are backed up by their bizarre keyboard player Viv and there latest drummer Mick Shrimpton.  The film documents how previous drummers met their grisly demise, whether it's choking on vomit (They can't prove whose vomit it was), through a bizarre gardening accident or simply exploding on stage (There was just a little green globule on his drum stool).Behind the scenes, Tap rely on manager Ian Faith (Tony Hendra) who has to organise their concerts (with little success) or deal with unpleasant hotel managers.  The band go through a number of different PR stunts to try and promote the album but sales are hindered by the cover.  The original, lurid cover was deemed sexist (What's wrong with being sexy? Nigel remarked) and so a compromise was reached which saw the album cover being completely black, with no design or logo of any sort on it.  Nigel tried to look on the bright side of the dismal cover (It's interesting though, because the question is How much more black could this be and the answer is...none.  None more black...).  Good-hearted PR man Artie Fufkin tries to organise an album signing which is also met with little success.  The band is beginning to fall apart, little by little and the arrival of David's girlfriend Jeanine is met with annoyance by Nigel, who proceeds to quit the band.  Is this the end of Spinal Tap?  You'll have to watch it and see.In between the vague plot, director di Bergi conducts interviews with the band and at one stage asks them about their reviews - The review you had on 'Shark Sandwich', which was just a two word review simply said 'Sh*t Sandwich'.  Of course, we couldn't have a film about rock and roll without the music and we are treated to excerpts from a number of Tap's songs, including Tonight I'm Gonna Rock You Tonight, Stonehenge (which features the smallest stone henge model you're likely to see - The problem was we had a model that was in danger of being crushed by a dwarf!), Big Bottom and Heavy Duty.  There is also the mention of a song we don't actually get to hear, the imaginatively titled Reach Out When You Die In My Champagne.The film is littered with a vast array of scenes and situations that you have probably heard of before; the opening stage pods which don't open, the custom made amps which go up to 11, not 10 (Well, it's one louder, isn't it?) and many more, there are too many to mention, really.If this enthusiastic review hasn't convinced you to see it, then I don't know what will, it is just hilarious, especially on numerous viewings, there is a lot you'll not pick up on at first.

Also, I feel that the humour is far better in Urban Legends Final Cut. I didn't like all the dirty sex jokes in the original. Urban Legends Final Cut has some lame lines, but very few.

When it comes to horror movies\/sequels, they only have to be entertaining to make me love them, some reviewers say that this film is a drag, I don't think so. I cant wait to see this flick again. Good on you John Ottman. I really cant wait for Urban Legend 3.

Julianne Moore was a bitter disappointment. More accurately, Clarice Starling was. Her character was boring and poorly scripted, the scenes she was in were basically tension-free.

Silence Of The Lambs was a gripping, chilling thriller; Hannibal is an attempt at a black comedy. I do admit, it was clever. I did enjoy the original book by Thomas Harris, and I think the screenplay was as entertaining as it could've been. Ridley Harris did a decent job as director - the shots of Florence were fantastic.All in all, I guess I enjoyed the movie.

In a time when we happily watch heroes fight evil robots in futuristic worlds it is striking to see something as convincing as McKellen's portrayal of Kurt Dussander - this evil on a monstrous scale is so clearly made human in an unremarkable American neighbourhood. This more than anything what made this film worth seeing.The apparent weakness of Dussander when first confronted by Brad Renfro's character is more striking on a second viewing, when the contrast with Dussander's later behaviour really shows. The scene where Dussander is ordered to march and gets so thoroughly into the role that the blackmailing teenager is horrified by what he sees - this is powerful viewing. The loneliness of the old man is shown so well by cutting between Dussander sitting alone outside, talking to a cat, while young Todd is in a car talking to a fine young lady. McKellen plays it all so well, and as we might guess, the Nazi war criminal starts to play the game himself, very convincingly.Despite the quite suburban setting, there are some horrible scenes which set out the idea most clearly that we are dealing with something worse than we can easily comprehend. Nightmare visuals are used to great effect, but the most moving of all involves no special effects at all, just a minor character acting. This film is dark and in places very unpleasant, but in some parts there is also a substantial amount of emotion, suddenly building up and almost getting carried away. With Ian McKellen's brilliant performance as well, I rate this film highly.

Slow and devastating, like a virus. Maybe we don't see that, because we expect to have fun, we just expect to spend a quiet evening and then (maybe) to go to sleep. Still, there's so much more in the movie than the gathering of stars like Douglas, Del Toro, Cheadle, Guzman, Finney, Zeta-Jones, Quaid and others. There is a story based on questions so many times asked before. But, are there any answers? Yes, there are answers &#150; but &#150; do you really want to hear them?The movie is not pessimistic. The story of a drug traffic that involves many sides in it doesn't even pretend to be didactical, although it may seem so. Sure, you can learn much, but director's only intention (so seems to me) is to tell a story. In a matter of fact, to tell more stories which are united around the same topic. Steven Soderbergh is very intelligent director, he can't always stand a cliché (just take a look at his `Schizopolis'), and he must do something with it. He uses yellow filter on camera for scenes that are happening in Mexico so we can almost feel the heat, and blue one for the scenes in Washington. He puts his protagonists in the close-ups so we can know them better. One last `trick' that S. uses are the roles of Steven Bauer and Miguel Ferrer. In this movie they both play drug merchants, but in the non-fiction miniseries `Drug Wars' (1990) they both played DEA agents that were fighting against drug traffic in Mexico. Oh yes, in this movie, for a change, people in Mexico do speak Spanish, all the time. When I compare `Traffic' to `Traffik' (the original British series) I can only say that Soderbergh knew what he was doing. Do you want me to explain that? Then see the `Traffik' first.`Traffic' is slow. So, if you want action, better look some other way. But if you want something that you'd remember the next day, when you wake up, this could be one of the best choices you can make.

A witty and perceptive writer, Mamet has translated his cynical worldview into some truly fine screenplays, including Glengarry Glen Ross, Hoffa, and Wag The  Dog.  It's when he directs his own work, however, that the material loses its spark.  His book, On Directing Film, lays out his functional, bare-bones stylistic sensibility, and while I applaud him for having such a clearly defined conception of the medium, it's a vision that leaches the life from his films.  State and Main is a great example of this, a humorous, clever screenplay which, under Mamet's leaden direction, turns into a curiously mundane and uninvolving experience.State and Main is set in a town under siege.  The town  Waterford, Vermont, a picturesque Norman Rockwell New England hamlet.  The invaders  the cast and crew of The Old Mill, a big-budget Hollywood picture that was chased out of the last town it shot in because of the statutory sexual tastes of its lead actor (Alec Baldwin).  The film crew slowly insinuates its way into the fabric of small-town life, and soon, even the townies at the local coffee shop are reading Variety and discussing box-office share.  Meanwhile, the old mill the crew came to shoot has been torn down, and because the film's lead actress (Sarah Jessica Parker) has suddenly refused to bare her breasts for the camera (even though she's done it in practically every other film she's done), the only way the film can be bailed out of budgetary hell is by finding a way to work in a plug for a dotcom company.  No mean feat for a turn-of-the-century costume drama.The pivotal figure at the core of the drama is The Old Mill's screenwriter (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), a once-promising playwright desperate to keep his integrity in the Hollywood rat race.  As he suffers the slings and arrows typical of the screenwriter's life, he finds himself falling in love with a local (Rebecca Pidgeon) and embroiled in an ethical crisis when he discovers Baldwin's star in a compromising position with yet another teenage girl (Julia Stiles).  When the scandal hits the local news, will the writer keep his integrity or cover his ass?  It sounds like promising material for a film, and indeed Mamet's screenplay puts it across with a fair degree of panache.  There's a number of amusing running gags, including a perplexing problem with a firehouse window and the writer's frustrating inability to resolve the issue of the actress' chest.  While the screenplay has quite a few loose ends and insufficiently developed plot threads (hints of Mamet's origins as a playwright), the main thrust is engaging, and the characters intriguing enough to keep you watching.  And of course, there's a fair helping of Mamet's curiously circular dialogue and intricately constructed gag lines.Unfortunately, this praise only applies to the screenplay, not the film that results from it.  After setting the scene for a quite exciting little satire, Mamet the screenwriter turns things over to Mamet the director, who proceeds to sap the spark and trickiness out of the material.  The film is well-acted, with Hoffman and Pidgeon providing a strong ethical and narrative anchor, and fine work being contributed by William H. Macy and David Paymer as, respectively, the film's director and the actress' agent.  Still, we get the feeling throughout the picture that any fire and passion we're seeing is being contributed by the actors.  Indeed, Mamet's presence as a director is barely felt throughout State and Main.  The style of the film is completely bland; cinematography is of the plunk-it-down-and-let-it-run school, music is unmemorable, and the picturesque design of the little town is never truly exploited for its homespun beauty.  The actors deliver their dialogue while standing around in stagy geometric patterns, Mamet ignoring the time tested law, cinema is action.  The drama eventually grows static as a result of this directorial indifference, and by the time the first hour has passed, you'll find yourself checking your watch.  Eventually, you don't really care how it turns out.  You just hope it turns out so you can go home.The mind boggles when considering what a truly gifted comic director could have done with State and Main.  With a reasonably good script and a fine cast like this, a Woody Allen or a Barry Levinson could have turned this into an edgy, exhilarating little gem.  Unfortunately, State and Main is a David Mamet film, and as such, what you see is all you get, no more, no less.

However, I did see this movie on the big screen, right after work and really enjoyed it.  It seems to me that some people were expecting too much out of a fairy tale story.  There was a nice round of applause after this movie ended, so I'm sure I wasn't the only one in the audience who appreciated a bit of escapism for about 2 hours.This is a movie about people and chocolate.  It's also a fable, in other words, it is not meant to be taken so seriously.  Having been raised Catholic, I could identify with the restrictions put upon the villagers, and I don't blame them for sinning!!As for the actors, the international cast ensemble is superb.   Juliette Binoche  is great as Vianne.  I  have never come across an actor\/actress that completely captivates me the way Binoche does,  I've even started watching her French foreign films.   She definetely has movie star presence.Lena Olin, Dame Judi Dench, Hugh O'Conor, Carrie-Ann Moss Alfred Molina, and the child actors do just fine in the supporting roles.   Johnny Depp  and the chocolates look really good on a big screen.Sure  this movie has its faults, no car crashes, nudity, profanity, etc. and doesn't really require people to think deeply.    If this is what you need in movies, skip this one.  I walked out of this movie with a light heart, knowing people can share different point of views and that Chocolat is still tempting and very sweet.

Violence in a right level, emotion, great actors participation, and more and more and much more. I can only accept good comments on this movie, because it is possible to find out several positive aspects we look for when watching a movie... You can smile, cry, learn, be tense, be happy... Just to highlight some good moments, I would briefly describe the scene of the conversation between Dennis Hopper (Christian's father) and Christopher Walken (gangster)when you can learn about history of South Europe civilization and in the same time can realize the very romantic and funny way found by Dennis to face his death (He gave to Christopher the explanation of South Italians have dark hairs). Also, how deep can go a dream of a person who has a pure love by his fan, and knew all the time how to use this dream to take him into the real world (This is Christian love by Elvis - his mentor all the time). This is a example of a movie you can really have a good fun!!! Congratulations to Tony Scott and Quentin as well.
