The script is neither over-done nor left to rot, but seems to hit the perfect note of helping the actors but not attempting to do the acting for them.

She also brings a note of tragedy to the film- which I will say nothing more about ;) For cinematography and music, this film is fairly straight-forward, but it was pretty well unnecessary in this case.

Broadly Batman & Robin is a remake of Schumacher's ever so marginally superior Batman Forever, a sequel which was fairly popular despite being the virtual clone of this reviled photochemical filth. So just why IS it so bloody dreadful? For a start it's astonishingly patronising to fans of the Dark Knight and fans of comic books in general. Akiva Goldman's screenplay, because I suppose we have to call it that, seems to assume that the audience will go and see absolutely anything provided its loud enough and bright enough. But as Tony Benn once remarked I don't believe in scapegoats so I'm afraid the people who are actually to blame are people like yourselves. You who went to see Forever 3 times, you who bought the video and the tie-in U2 single and yes you, the one who said it was all much more fun than the previous one. In fact everyone who partook in the process of making Forever the biggest box-office hit of 1995 was consciously and complicitly creating the commercial space in which this barely nourished and puerile spectacle would gestate. Schumacher said that it was the first film in which he's ever cared more about the money than the material, an hilarious assertion given that there isn't any material just cringe inducing puns, unbearable witless camp and a lot of white noise. In a rare case of life imitating art I knew a man who was actually a human cartoon, as witless, camp and overbearing as this movie and he rushed out to buy the box-set version on video, spending a fortune in the process. Proof that it isn't just owners and pets that sometimes resemble each other, it extends to people and bad movies too. Please, please please Warners, delete this. Do it tonight, you'll sleep better.

The plot is something I have not seen too much in the past, so it is original at least to me. David Duchovny plays a happily married man whose wife unexpectedly dies. He is depressed and down-hearted, but he meets a woman whose heart is actually his deceased's wife's, as she was an organ donor and the new woman in his life took her heart.The strength of this movie is the cast, and what a cast it is. The best in the cast is a personal favorite of mine, Carroll O'Connor, in his last film role. He plays the woman's uncle, and he is priceless, he is a character that is so funny, and has so much heart, he fits in this movie perfectly, he is such a master of entertainment by now. Minnie Driver and David Duchovny are so good together, they have a perfect chemistry, Duchovny is not your typical leading man, he is not so suave and debonair, and Driver, while she is cute, is not your typical bimbo, she is an actress with substance, and proves it here.The characters here are very engrossing, they bring you into the world, and all of the nuances, the sadness, the happiness, this movie has it all. the fascinating thing about a movie like this though is it is not a hardcore movie, it is not intense, it mostly is not violent, it is just a sweet lite as air movie, no cussing, nothing like that, and it it almost perfect. There is a minor clash of cultures movie, as Duchovny's character is fairly wealthy, while Dirver's character is more working class, working in her uncle's restaurant. The jokes in this movie are well thought out, not forced, and not over the top. The jokes come from situations and dialogue, and the movie is all acting, the movie would be nothing without the performances How many movies like this can you say are all acting, no gunplay, or car chases or anything like that? Sadly not many. And there is not a week cast member either. David Alan Grier another comedian\/actor I like because he is such a different type of performer, does a fine job. Robert Loggia, James Belushi, and Bonnie Hunt, who was the brains behind this movie also do excellent jobs. And I can't say enough about Carroll O'Connor, I wish you would saw him more before his death. It was sad too, he could make any horrible movie or show excellent.The Chicago and Italy locations are excellent too. The cinematography is breathtaking. You gotta give kudos to Bonnie Huny for coming up with something so good, she just has a knack for this kinda thing, she should do more movies, if they are going to be this good. David Duchovny also does an excellent job, I wasn't a fan of the X-Files, but he really proved himself as an actor here. He is very funny while doing some very good acting too.I also liked this movie because it borough together all of these actors, and a lot of them are known, but they're not marquee stars, that brings a certain down to earth element to the movie. To add to that the movie works because nobody steals the spotlight the movie is a team effort, everyone gets good lines, everybody feeds off of everybody to make this movie so good.

I just got an incredible feeling watching this movie, it's too bad more people didn't watch it, it was phenomenal in it's own respect.

She's always on the outside looking in, incredibly needy and her own worst enemy; scuppering any relationship before she can be rejected &#150; maybe there's a hint of the autobiographical in what she does? However, man can she sing! Now before anyone tries to 'out' me for this &#150; take a look at the bigger picture here. Streisand invariably plays Streisand &#150; that's smart &#150; she knows her limitations and so doesn't attempt anything too grandiose. The rest of the film is just as well-balanced.Robert Redford is also fairly one-dimensional as an actor. However, his dimension is the fifth &#150; on a plane occupied by Steve McQueen, James Dean and other such deceased luminaries &#150; if only he had the good taste to die he would be legend. His skill is on playing to his limitations and attributes also.Sydney Pollack directs &#150; Sydney Pollack IS a legend (Tootsie, The Fabulous Baker Boys) &#150; all great films can be attributed to the quality of the directing. This is a truism. No actor can carry a turkey but a great director can stuff one, baste it and slow-cook it to perfection.As well as being a totally seductive love story (one of the few a man can watch and not run the risk of having to sacrifice his cajones), The Way We Were is that rarest of things in Hollywood, an historical document. It manages to sneak under the radar by telling Hollywood's story in the era of McCarthyism and the 'House Un-American Activities Committee' as Redford's college athlete golden boy discovers not only is he handsome, skillful, stylish and cool but he's also a fairly decent writer who ends up re-writing his own screenplays which are perceived as being 'commie' (It doesn't help that his missus (Babs) is an outspoken Marxist with high fallutin' notions about the first amendment (freedom of speech)).Their relationship is rocky from day one. She becomes obsessed with him the moment she first spies him; he finds her curious and inspiring and her belief in his ability and the importance of his writing whilst slightly maniacal drives him to produce great works. Were it not for her, it is likely he would have stayed in the army or taken a sinecure somewhere and drank himself to oblivion whilst still looking fabulous &#150; Gatsby style! She seems to drift on his coat-tails whilst forever railing against his decadent friends and lifestyle and whatever cause of the day takes her rage on its inexorable wave and they eventually split and rekindle and split again&#133; but not before hammering out the finer points of why 'it..just&#133;wont&#133;work' &#150; this is beautifully done. They know they are doomed. He is too perfect. Everything comes easy to him. She is too unsatisfied, mostly with herself. Nothing is good enough for him in her eyes and everything too good for her &#150; she feels out of place.The scriptwriters; and this is rare, write the rise AND demise of a love story rather than just the development and crescendo of one. They see it out in all of its explosive fury and passionate hopelessness. The characters are believable. It's a thing of beauty to look at too &#150; seventies films have that special something which has subsequently been lost &#150; the film stock permits the audience a certain viscera and tangibility and the sets, costumes, acting, directing, soundtrack and cinematography are simply gorgeous &#150; there's a real craftsmanship to the film. From the flawlessness of every scene, the stills of which could easily be sold as art, to the attention to detail in capturing the era &#150; no expense is spared &#150; no detail overlooked&#133; and the music! One can only be moved by that bloody song.This is the backdrop created for the actors who can only but perform up-to-par and they do. They must have been conscious of the amount of face close-ups where their expressions were paramount or the long drawn out shots where they ARE the scene &#150; or maybe not &#150; maybe Sydney Pollack made the most of what they were doing and not the opposite &#150; who knows? In either case you are transported through art &#150; the effect is like theatre, which in recent times film-makers have forgotten, bent as they are in cramming in as many scenes, explosions, effects, bright lights and noises as possible and labelling it high-octane action (with the notable exception of some of the new generation, Spike Jonze, Todd Solondz et al).I want a film that moves me, not causes me to have to move for fear of developing photo-sensitive epilepsy or going deaf in one ear &#150; where is the craft in that? Where is the art? Always remember, film, at its very core is art.This film is as close to film-art perfection as you will find.Enjoy!

One look at her face and you know what she's going to do &#150; fail. She's always on the outside looking in, incredibly needy and her own worst enemy; scuppering any relationship before she can be rejected &#150; maybe there's a hint of the autobiographical in what she does? However, man can she sing! Now before anyone tries to 'out' me for this &#150; take a look at the bigger picture here. Streisand invariably plays Streisand &#150; that's smart &#150; she knows her limitations and so doesn't attempt anything too grandiose. The rest of the film is just as well-balanced.Robert Redford is also fairly one-dimensional as an actor. However, his dimension is the fifth &#150; on a plane occupied by Steve McQueen, James Dean and other such deceased luminaries &#150; if only he had the good taste to die he would be legend. His skill is on playing to his limitations and attributes also.Sydney Pollack directs &#150; Sydney Pollack IS a legend (Tootsie, The Fabulous Baker Boys) &#150; all great films can be attributed to the quality of the directing.

The original opening of the film with Bogart coming in as church services are being conducted for a few hundred uncomprehending native Africans is Director John Huston's comment on the usefulness of the lives Morley and Hepburn have led up to that point.

This time, one girl has already faced the monster, and she must face him again. Couldn't stay away, could she?First of all I must say that I'm a big fan of the series. The original is a classic of the genre but the sequels are hit or miss. Director Steve Miner, who did a good job on part 2, struggles a bit this time around. No doubt the fact that this film was shot with 3-D in mind helps to hinder the film's look. The extreme closeups probably looked swell in theatres back in '82 but now look kinda hokey.Pacing is rather off, as well. While Parts 1 and 2 had mostly pointless middle sections, the one here goes by rather painfully. Perhaps the fault lies mostly with the characters, here they're not interesting at all. Potentially funny moments are wasted, like the two junkies who look like they're going to provide some comedy relief but don't. The actors are way below average this time around as well. Dana Kimmell (who reportedly had some influence in downsizing the film's gore) looks pretty enough but her acting talents are mostly confined to screaming a lot. At least she does that well. Paul Kratka has to be a huge contender for the worst actor in the series, his performance is bad beyond words. I bet most people are cheering Jason on when he's crushing his skull. All others are pretty bad as well, the two junkies seem to fare best. And those bikers...pretty lame.One other thing, not really the film's fault, but rather those blasted MPAA pruners; It's drastically cut and it hurts the film badly. You can clearly see some sloppy editing at the time when some gore seems to be coming and it's terribly annoying (but this is mostly evident in the British cut of the film).But not all is bad. Once Jason gets going the film comes to life and Miner manages to extract a decent amount of suspense. The cinematography looks good in a widescreen version and it makes quite a bit of difference. Plus it's here that Jason dons the fine mask.Now, if only they'd release an unrated version of this film and maybe in it's full 3-D incarnation I'd be a happy camper.

This film succeeds, in the horror genre, on every level possible. The performance by Kurt Russell as the reluctant hero is perfect and from a guy's perspective is about as cool as it gets. Carpenter uses the dark and frosty antarctic scenery to full advantage, making the indoor scenes all the more claustrophobic. The alien isn't some lug wandering about in a rubber suit, but rather something far nastier and biologically invasive and truer to the spirit of the source material. Me, I'm far more frightened of what I cannot see than of what I can see, and the fact that you don't know who has been infected by the thing and who hasn't is a great horror device. Carpenter knows this and uses the resulting paranoia of the main players as a centerpiece for the tension. Finally, I guarantee that you will never have seen special effects of this horrific, gruesome magnitude in any other film, and may well never again due to the modern predominance of CGI. The only film I can think of that compares with the special effects of The Thing is David Cronenberg's remake of The Fly, but I still give The Thing the nod for its inventiveness. Unfortunately, many people at the time of the release of this movie ignored the brilliance of John Carpenter's craft because they were so repulsed by the special effects (which many people cannot stomach). The film reviewers of 1982 should hang their heads in shame, because contrary to what they had to say, John Carpenter DID pay mind to his characterization and created what is in my opinion the creepiest film of all time, due primarily to Carpenter's craftsmanship and the novel brilliances of effects master Rob Bottin.

The alien isn't some lug wandering about in a rubber suit, but rather something far nastier and biologically invasive and truer to the spirit of the source material. Me, I'm far more frightened of what I cannot see than of what I can see, and the fact that you don't know who has been infected by the thing and who hasn't is a great horror device. Carpenter knows this and uses the resulting paranoia of the main players as a centerpiece for the tension. Finally, I guarantee that you will never have seen special effects of this horrific, gruesome magnitude in any other film, and may well never again due to the modern predominance of CGI. The only film I can think of that compares with the special effects of The Thing is David Cronenberg's remake of The Fly, but I still give The Thing the nod for its inventiveness. Unfortunately, many people at the time of the release of this movie ignored the brilliance of John Carpenter's craft because they were so repulsed by the special effects (which many people cannot stomach). The film reviewers of 1982 should hang their heads in shame, because contrary to what they had to say, John Carpenter DID pay mind to his characterization and created what is in my opinion the creepiest film of all time, due primarily to Carpenter's craftsmanship and the novel brilliances of effects master Rob Bottin.

The last half hour is amazingly suspenseful and contains some grueling images that'll definitely excite horror fans. The set pieces and costumes are excellent and with a great eye for detail. For the legendary actor Yul Brunner, this was an ideal movie to conclude his brilliant career and simultaneously a great opportunity to bring homage his entire repertoire. Slightly negative elements about Westworld include the rather goofy choice of music and the abrupt ending.

Indy uncovers part of the secret in a catacomb in Venice, then rescues his father from a Nazi fortress in Austria, only to discover Donovan is working for the Nazis. The race is on to reach the Grail before Donovan and his henchmen.The third Indiana Jones movie for me is not quite in the same league as the first two, but is still a tremendously entertaining action-packed adventure film. The problem for me is twofold. Firstly, the father-son relationship, which is made the prime focus of the action and drama. I like my mythic heroes pure, uncluttered with pasts, commitments and families. I don't want to see them trying to rationalise their imperfect childhood with their absent father. Who gives a good goddamn about that ? Secondly, the villains - villains in escapist entertainment should be evil through-and-through. Glover is too bland and Doody's character is all over the place - one minute she's a villainous femme-fatale Nazi and the next she's having moral dilemmas ? However, there is much to enjoy here - the opening sequence featuring Phoenix as a young boy-scout Indy is fun, as is the rat-filled catacombs speedboat chase scene, and the brilliantly-staged finale in the tomb of the Grail. There are also some very nice comic touches, like the scene where Hitler unwittingly autographs the diary the characters spend most of the movie fighting over, or the moment where the Joneses are in a biplane being chased by Messerschmitts and Indy yells, Dad, eleven o'clock !!, to which Dad replies, What happens then ?. Connery is a bit hard to swallow as Indy's Dad (too young and not remotely American), but his performance is surprisingly subtle and effective. This is a Steven Spielberg movie, and so of course is hugely enjoyable and visually brilliant, but I'm afraid for me it's not nearly a patch on Raiders Of The Lost Ark.

About one hour into the film, I was shocked, simply SHOCKED to find that it had almost nothing to do with the book. I watched on, and to my horror, I found that the hedges, playground, and boiler were gone, replaced with typewriters, mazes, elevators brimming with blood, and slaughtered girls in a hallway. However, I watched on, and the movie gave me grim satisfaction at the end. Kubrick had simply taken the main idea and ran with it. Why did I still like the movie? Simple It's good. The macabre scenes were enough to cure my blood lust and strong actors graced the story (despite what most people say, I found that Shelley Duvall was a better actor than Jack Nicholson in many of the scenes; he seemed rusty and forced, and his eyebrows didn't help any, either). The movie did not scare me the same way the book had, but its weirdness takes its place, making it a great experience. I gave it a nine only because of its occasional slow scenes.Watch this movie. ","genre":"Drama, Horror"},{"date":"18 June 2005","score":"","review":" This is a famous film, whose main components are classics of film-making--an interesting love story, a classic mystery and psychological complications--for nearly all concerned... This is an A effort in B\/W in every respect. Some of the sets for the flashback sequences were designed by Salvador Dali; the direction is by Alfred Hitchcock and the lighting,art direction, Miklos Rozsa's famous musical score, sets and actors all lend heightened abilities to the narrative. The interesting element of Spellbound to me has always been its plot line. the plot theme is fidelity, ranging from the heroine's belief in her mentally-troubled love, that young man's loyalty to priorities even at his worst moments of doubt, and the sincerity of all the doctors, save one, to the honesty of their profession-- helping minds back to reality. As the heroine, Ingrid Bermgan is lovely and very professional; she almost makes an audience believe she is an emotionally- inexperienced spinster. Gregory Peck is handsome and promising and frequently effective as the man who wanders into her life in need of her help. Leo G. Carroll has yet another feature film part that he brings to intelligent life as the acting head of a sanatorium who is Bergman's adviser. others in the cast are given less to do but are uniformly good; and young Rhonda Fleming has a brief part as a lethal but lovely patient. The famous use of parallel lines is employed like a leitmotif throughout the film; this image is what always sets Peck's mind off its amnesiac second identity's track, and what each time provides clues as Bergman keeps Peck from the police, risks her life, and tries to cause him to remember who he is, what really happened to the doctor he is suspected of having murdered, and finally to discover what is the whole truth about the man in whom she so deeply believes. That the filmmaker, Hitchcock, managed to make this film dramatic and never glossy, and to keep its story centered on Bergman's purposes both as a psychiatric professional and a woman is a fine accomplishment. The film can be watched many times, I suggest, precisely because despite its lack of outdoor sets and overt physical actions, its internal logical, dialogue and relationships are quite compellingly worked out. A superior noir thriller, with the expected Hitchcockian focus and sustained interest.
