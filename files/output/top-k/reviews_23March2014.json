It shows the reality that there were quite a few people not okay being around Gay's. This is an issue that still exists today, which is why the movie will live on for many years to come. It also didn't remind me of any other AIDS related movies, which makes it unique.Praise- This movie contains 2 of the best performances that Denzel Washington and Tom Hanks have given in their career. At the time Hanks wasn't known for many dramatic roles as he was primarily in comedic roles. Obviously now we know him as one of the greatest actors of all time. Hanks really does pull off the emotional side very well. As for Washington, I really liked that they didn't just make him right away erase his homophobia. For a man who was raised a certain way I would have had a hard time believing him automatically accepting the case. So I'm glad that even at times during the case he admitted he's still bothered by homosexuals. Antonio Banderas was decent with limited screen time, but the real stars were Hanks and Washington. I'm very surprised Denzel wasn't nominated for an Oscar that year. Could have been because it rarely happens that 2 actors from the same movie both get lead nominations. Considering this movie involves him as much as it involved Hanks.Complaints (Minor)- Throughout the movie there are weird camera angles. And I actually found myself distracted at times. it seemed like the director\/cinematographer decided they wanted to shoot this movie with as many close ups as possible on each actor. It was like in TV shows when actors look directly into the camera and break the 'Fourth Wall', well this movie often showed the actors looking into the camera probably for dramatic effect, which didn't really add much. Another minor complaint was the pacing. I felt it started off intriguing but then for a good 30 minutes it felt slow and barely involved the lead character. Jonathan Demme is usually good with this, as in Silence of the Lambs, its paced perfectly.Final Thoughts- It's a very good movie, with legendary performances from the lead, but wasn't perfect. Its good for anyone who likes Tom Hanks, or was interested in the story of how some people with AIDS were mistreated. 8.1\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 March 2014","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Impression- Being one of the first mainstream movies to tackle the AIDS\/Homophobic topic, it does a great job at bringing both sides to the story.

However, I'd like to ask all those people to keep an open mind, and to try to see this from my perspective. I never liked this movie! Not even after I first saw it. I wanna put all of you in my shoes Your eight years old, Batman comes out, you go see it, and afterwords, you're blown away by its sheer greatness. Shortly after, a sequel is announced, and you're ecstatic! You can't wait for it, you expect it to be all that the previous film was and more, then, a few years pass, the film comes out, you see it, and its a complete dud! That's exactly how I felt when I saw Batman Returns. Batman Returns didn't even feel like it was in the same series as Batman! Where as Batman was exciting and fun, Batman Returns was dreary and depressing. None of the villains were charismatic, or fun to watch like Nicholson's Joker, they were all one dimensional and had no motivations! Keaton still plays Batman fairly well, but nothing at all is done with his Bruce Wayne persona. Which in and of itself, presents a huge problem when a semi love interest is interjected into the film. As with Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale, Michelle Pfeiffer does a decent job with what she's given, but that's the problem with her character. You don't know what kind of person Selina Kyle really is, and we have no idea what her agenda is as Catwoman. Why does she want Penguin to frame Batman? We don't know and we never find out. The Biggest problem of the film however, is Danny Devito as The Penguin. Aside from the fact that he rides around in a motorized rubber duck, and that the image of his army of rocket pack penguins is the most unintentionally hilarious thing I've ever seen, The Penguin has to be one of the most poorly done comic book villains ever! The problem is, that The Penguin is done in such an inconsistent way. One minute Tim Burton wants us all to feel sorry for him, and then the next, he wants us all to detest him as the evil villain. As for my experience with the film It didn't leave me in a good mood or hungry for more, as the first film did. It left me feeling dreary, sick, and empty. For me, going from Batman to Batman Returns felt like chasing Champagne with sewer water. The first drink was great, but the second just left a bad taste in my mouth.

While the film's production problems were well publicised, the final version fits together well, despite some jumps in the narrative and an ending the feels a bit rushed. Furthermore, it doesn't ensure that some genuinely interesting supporting character's development comes to a satisfying conclusion. However, that doesn't overtly mar this story. The film generates a genuine atmosphere of adventure, suspense and fear, and some of the action sequences are thrilling. This is helped by Peter Menzies's photography and above all by Jerry Goldsmith's thunderous score. Greame Revell's original score is interesting, but in no way matches the power of Goldsmith's music, and it was definitely the right decision by producer and writer Michael Crichton to replace Revell's score with a new one by Goldsmith as part of his process of taking over the production and re-editing the film himself as a result of poor test screening results. It is an interesting to note however, what John McTiernan's vision of this film was bearing in mind he left the production before completion when Crichton took over. The story is solid, and the journey is seen from the perspective of Arab poet turned diplomat played very well by Antonio Banderas. One of this films key strengths is the chemistry of the Viking group actors, in particular the towering performance from Vladimir Kulich the leader Buliwyf; the entertaining one from Dennis Storhoi as Herger, and a very engaging one from Daniel Southern as Edgtho. The antagonist is largely faceless and is a collective for most of the film. The device used to keep the audience interested is therefore the excellent interplay between the whole Viking group and Banderas's character.Actions scenes are well done, and work brilliantly with the aforementioned score. But as is the case with these large profile action films, the ending is what lets the film down. This is due to a rush at the film's conclusion, so while the Buliwyf's character's arc is satisfyingly resolved, this isn't the case for the remaining characters. We don't see what the other Vikings motivations or plans are post climax, and even Banderas's character resolution feels rushed and isn't sufficiently built up to a level that is appropriately satisfying. A hint at a romantic interlude with a local Norse woman is never resolved and looks like a potentially studio driven intention to have a quick ending as the film runs quiet long. Audiences however, will accept a good story, even if the film runs longer (e.g. Dances With Wolves, Lord of the Rings, Avatar) and I felt that the film-makers should have taken their time to sign the characters off with satisfying and complete character arcs. Overall though, an enjoyable and exciting adventure.

But it's not bad space opera, and of the three prequels, I thought this one is the best.It suffers the usual problems of a middle segment without a real beginning, middle, or end, but the story really makes some progress here, taking us from an assassination attempt of Anakin Skywalkers's love Padme to a long-brewing plot to create an army of the Republic, soon to be an army of the Empire. The Jedi plausibly fall for the manipulations that lead to the need for such an army to counteract the Sith puppet, the Trade Federation. Film 2 also sets up all the key characters from an ambiguously good Anakin to the Emperor, and introduces great new ones, like Count Dookoo.You can't go wrong casting Christopher Lee as an evil mastermind. He and Peter Cushing, who played the evil mastermind in the original, are grand relics of the glory days of Hammer films, famous for the 60s Dracula and Frankenstein productions. It would have been great to have both of these good friends in the same film (and of sorts, they are in Episode 3). Alas, it was not to be due to Cushing's untimely death many years ago, but it's nice to see them strut their stuff in different parts of Star Wars.On the other hand, you can go wrong with Hayden Christensen's Anakin. The attack on Anakin's mother provides some background for his fall, but not enough. HC is just not up to the task he can look brooding, but more like an awkward teenager. The same awkwardness permeates his attachment to the much older and more self-secure Padme. This role, in all three prequels, really needed a more weighty (literally!) actor, a big intelligent farmhand who resented his slavery and had a chip on his shoulder from his earliest days. The actors in the prequels try their best, but they just can't pull it off. They needed someone of David Prowse size with a voice that could mature into a James Earl Jones voice, not just someone with dark rings around his eyes.The movie has a lot going for it, though, besides Christopher Lee. Interesting chases of assassins and bounty hunters employing them, a Ewan McGregor who is getting more into his Obi Wan routine, a dark background story for the imperial storm troopers, the factory from hell, and a silly but awesome Roman Colosseum scene that segues into a serious battle, where the Jedi in the waning days of their wisdom employ their very undoing to win a temporary victory, as Yoda immediately recognizes. The John Williams music, now derivative of himself being derivative of Dvorak is still great. Some good use is still made of the humor of R2 and 3PO, but not enough. In general, the original trilogy had more fun being a humorous and adventurous space opera, whereas the prequels are lacking in the humor department (unless you think Jar Jar Binks is funny).As always, Lucas overdoes it on the special effects, and doesn't know when to cut what does not work (like Anakin flying fruit onto Padme's fork). One of the things that made John Carpenters The Thing so great was his good taste in when to cut out unsatisfactory special effects, as anyone who has seen the deleted scenes from said film knows.Still, the film moves along nicely from beginning to end not as relentlessly as most post- 2000 action flicks, which were scripted for an audience suffering ADD, and not as slow as a 'serious' sf drama like Solaris. If parts VII and onward are about as good as this, the audience should not complain too much. And the Abrams style is much more suited to space opera than to Star Trek in any case.

Note I didn't say 'favorite', because in general, these films are on a seriously lower grade level than the Dark Knight pictures. I guess for me, this story at least had some character development missing in the prior two pictures, as in the exploration of Bruce Wayne\/Batman's (Val Kilmer) duality and the story of Robin's (Chris O'Donnell) origin. Batman's conflict was given added weight with the presence of Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman), a psychologist who found herself in a similar conflict over which one to choose as a romantic interest. There was an interesting scene where Wayne walked right into an unset trap by seeing a bat in a Rorschach drawing. That was a revelation for both Bruce and the shrink.As far as villains go, I think the franchise would have been better off by introducing one bad guy at a time instead of two or three as in Batman and Robin, because the story seems to get watered down when the hero has to concentrate on multiple enemies. You generally didn't find that to be the case in the comics, but I understand that the film makers were probably trying to get the biggest bang for the buck with their casting choices.So with that in mind, Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey were two hot names at the time, and were generally suitable picks for their respective alter-egos, Two-Face and The Riddler. Quite honestly, I didn't discern much difference between Jones's Two-Face and Nicholson's Joker, almost opposite sides of the same coin if you catch the irony.

Have you at one point in your childhood wished you were big or tall enough just so you could fit in? I know there are plenty of us, including myself, who've been in the same shoes as the main character of director Penny Marshall's 1988 comedy-fantasy Big at least once in our childhoods. Josh Baskin, a young boy at the age of 12 (going on 13), goes to a mysterious fortune teller machine and wishes he was big so he can do more adult stuff. The next day, he gets his wish and discovers that he has literally become an adult overnight. Now, an adult Josh (Tom Hanks) and his best friend Billy (Jared Rushton) must try and figure out how to get their hands on that machine and set things right, but not without exploring the life of an adult first. Adult Josh is lucky enough to land a job as a data entry clerk at a toy company, but then he obtains a promotion to become a paid toy player for the company. You see, Josh's boss Mr. MacMillan (Robert Loggia) is deeply impressed with his current insight into the latest toys and his childlike enthusiasm. His admiration for Josh is further warranted by his innovative ideas for new toys to put on the market. Josh's creativity also impresses fellow company executive Susan Lawrence (Elizabeth Perkins) with whom he eventually initiates a special romantic bond with and whose boyfriend Paul Davenport (John Heard) is&#x85;.jealous of him to say the least. So it seems like this guy of 13 going on 30 is living the American dream. But there's only one problem he still needs to get back to his 13-year-old life before his friends grow up without him. I've always been intrigued by people who are either unemployed or unexperienced enough to go to the top and yet somehow get to the top faster than anyone else. This personal fascination was present whenever Cosmo Kramer appeared on screen in the TV series Seinfeld and it's certainly present throughout Big. What I really like about this movie is that it takes a concept that would be seemingly dumb and silly in other hands and makes it into something that's very smart, funny, and even profound. Tom Hanks perfectly fits into his role since he maintains the innocence and energy of a child (as a kid in his situation most likely would) while also showing the maturity of an adult at the same time. I love how we can clearly see him struggling between this new adult life he suddenly started and his childhood life which he still hasn't finished yet. I don't recall a day in my adulthood so far where I didn't feel similar to Josh in that I'm just not ready for what the real world has to offer. Big truly is one of those films that anybody can relate to, both on a dramatic level and especially on a comedic level. Robert Loggia is simply outstanding as Josh's boss, Mr. MacMillan. What absolutely delights me about this character is that even though he does something that normally would never happen in the real world, you get the sense that he knows what he's doing. After all, he does work at a toy company. And aren't the best toys successful because of their creativity? In a way, this is an ideal position for Josh because of his unique ideas for toys. Furthermore, his ideas aren't coming from statistics and charts like Paul (such as a building turning into a robot), his ideas are coming from his own special imagination (hence the electronic comic book). And I completely admire such enthusiastic characters as Mr. MacMillan who desires these traits in their employees. Oh, and his famous foot-operated electronic keyboard duet with Hanks is awesome, too. This wonderful film was written by Steven Spielberg's sister, Anne Spielberg, and Gary Ross (who'd later write and direct Pleasantville (1998), Seabiscuit (2003), and The Hunger Games (2012)). All I can say is kudos to Spielberg and Ross for their collaboration on this stellar script. Almost every line in this film is very well chosen and fully thought through. The jokes hit their targets with efficient timing and genuine affection. I've gone over how strong the characters of Josh and Mr. MacMillan are, but the other supporting characters hold their own, too. Josh's friend Billy is a fun sidekick since he has more than one superb exchange with Josh. Also, the way in which he helps Josh by helping him apply for a job or even stealing from his parent's emergency funds feels like how a real kid would handle those scenarios. Josh's adult love interest Susan is also very strong in the sense that she starts to connect more with Josh primarily because of his strong passion and love for his job. It was an absolute pleasure having a look at Big again with my family at my side. I loved this film when I watched it as a kid and I love it now. Director Penny Marshall executed this excellent script by Spielberg and Ross with the utmost care and passion. The film is filled with funny moments from beginning to end and every single laugh is earned. Every one of the main characters is relatable and the actors chosen to bring these people to life are irreplaceable. With all due respect to Dustin Hoffman and his performance in Rain Man (1988), I would have given the Oscar for Best Actor that year to Hanks since there was simply more intrigue and fun put into his performance. In the words of none other than Mr. MacMillan, all that needs to be said is Well done, Josh. Well done.

Furthermore, his ideas aren't coming from statistics and charts like Paul (such as a building turning into a robot), his ideas are coming from his own special imagination (hence the electronic comic book). And I completely admire such enthusiastic characters as Mr. MacMillan who desires these traits in their employees. Oh, and his famous foot-operated electronic keyboard duet with Hanks is awesome, too. This wonderful film was written by Steven Spielberg's sister, Anne Spielberg, and Gary Ross (who'd later write and direct Pleasantville (1998), Seabiscuit (2003), and The Hunger Games (2012)). All I can say is kudos to Spielberg and Ross for their collaboration on this stellar script. Almost every line in this film is very well chosen and fully thought through. The jokes hit their targets with efficient timing and genuine affection. I've gone over how strong the characters of Josh and Mr. MacMillan are, but the other supporting characters hold their own, too. Josh's friend Billy is a fun sidekick since he has more than one superb exchange with Josh. Also, the way in which he helps Josh by helping him apply for a job or even stealing from his parent's emergency funds feels like how a real kid would handle those scenarios. Josh's adult love interest Susan is also very strong in the sense that she starts to connect more with Josh primarily because of his strong passion and love for his job. It was an absolute pleasure having a look at Big again with my family at my side. I loved this film when I watched it as a kid and I love it now. Director Penny Marshall executed this excellent script by Spielberg and Ross with the utmost care and passion. The film is filled with funny moments from beginning to end and every single laugh is earned. Every one of the main characters is relatable and the actors chosen to bring these people to life are irreplaceable. With all due respect to Dustin Hoffman and his performance in Rain Man (1988), I would have given the Oscar for Best Actor that year to Hanks since there was simply more intrigue and fun put into his performance. In the words of none other than Mr. MacMillan, all that needs to be said is Well done, Josh. Well done.

Have you at one point in your childhood wished you were big or tall enough just so you could fit in? I know there are plenty of us, including myself, who've been in the same shoes as the main character of director Penny Marshall's 1988 comedy-fantasy Big at least once in our childhoods. Josh Baskin, a young boy at the age of 12 (going on 13), goes to a mysterious fortune teller machine and wishes he was big so he can do more adult stuff. The next day, he gets his wish and discovers that he has literally become an adult overnight. Now, an adult Josh (Tom Hanks) and his best friend Billy (Jared Rushton) must try and figure out how to get their hands on that machine and set things right, but not without exploring the life of an adult first. Adult Josh is lucky enough to land a job as a data entry clerk at a toy company, but then he obtains a promotion to become a paid toy player for the company. You see, Josh's boss Mr. MacMillan (Robert Loggia) is deeply impressed with his current insight into the latest toys and his childlike enthusiasm. His admiration for Josh is further warranted by his innovative ideas for new toys to put on the market. Josh's creativity also impresses fellow company executive Susan Lawrence (Elizabeth Perkins) with whom he eventually initiates a special romantic bond with and whose boyfriend Paul Davenport (John Heard) is&#x85;.jealous of him to say the least. So it seems like this guy of 13 going on 30 is living the American dream. But there's only one problem he still needs to get back to his 13-year-old life before his friends grow up without him. I've always been intrigued by people who are either unemployed or unexperienced enough to go to the top and yet somehow get to the top faster than anyone else. This personal fascination was present whenever Cosmo Kramer appeared on screen in the TV series Seinfeld and it's certainly present throughout Big. What I really like about this movie is that it takes a concept that would be seemingly dumb and silly in other hands and makes it into something that's very smart, funny, and even profound. Tom Hanks perfectly fits into his role since he maintains the innocence and energy of a child (as a kid in his situation most likely would) while also showing the maturity of an adult at the same time. I love how we can clearly see him struggling between this new adult life he suddenly started and his childhood life which he still hasn't finished yet. I don't recall a day in my adulthood so far where I didn't feel similar to Josh in that I'm just not ready for what the real world has to offer. Big truly is one of those films that anybody can relate to, both on a dramatic level and especially on a comedic level. Robert Loggia is simply outstanding as Josh's boss, Mr. MacMillan. What absolutely delights me about this character is that even though he does something that normally would never happen in the real world, you get the sense that he knows what he's doing. After all, he does work at a toy company. And aren't the best toys successful because of their creativity? In a way, this is an ideal position for Josh because of his unique ideas for toys.

It is not a movie as much as a full blown experience. In fact, as millions of people can attest, even trying to watch 2001 in a way one watches any other movie will simply lead to frustration and annoyance. People expect dialogue, plot, humor and resolution in their movies. The want a narrative that they are familiar with and that they understand. Kubrick's film is an experience more like watching a ballet or opera than actually sitting down and watching a movie. It is a movie that takes work, concentration, and patience. You soak in its images in all of their beauty and think about what is on the screen. Eventually the picture grips you on a subconscious level and speaks to you in the same way any great art does- personally. Once you get the message that Kubrick is trying to give, you can't necessarily verbalize it- you just feel it and are in awe.What is it about?Most of the time I can give a pretty simple synopsis of what a movie is about and why they should watch it. I can't do this with 2001. I simply smile and say it's about everything.A few minor qualms that I felt dejected was the pace of the story (which really lacks), lack of depth to the history of the black monolith and certain dragging scenes (replacing the damaged part, ships landing on the moon, etc.). I felt too much details on the props and effects. I'm just one who enjoys a good story, smart screenplay, artists performances, realism, what we can learn from, score and cinematography. Other than that 2001 A Space Odyssey delivers some of the qualities that make an awesome film, and has influenced Directors and movie fans alike.This groundbreaking film may have various effects depending on the viewer. If your into fast paced, dialogue heavy and interesting plots, then this may not be entertaining. For lovers of visual effects, less script, snail paced yet detailed settings, thought provoking moments and exquisite psychedelic like visuals, then this will be a treat. 2001 A Space Odyssey is likewise a stand-along monument, a great visionary leap, unsurpassed in its vision of man and the universe. It was a statement that came at a time which now looks something like the peak of humanity's technological optimism.

The reviews seemed favourable enough and the trailer was enticing. Regrettably, it is not a film I can appreciate. It is messy, uneven and pretentious. The plot barely makes sense, the scenes from a supposed film that the protagonist is working on are beyond absurd and the only saving grace is dancing. I only wish there would be more of it and much, much less of the rest. Unfortunately, the learning process is mostly omitted and the protagonist becomes this amazingly proficient dancer all of a sudden - which is implausible to the point of ridiculous - in reality it would take her a minimum of 5 years of intensive work to be able to dance like that - Tango is an incredibly complex and demanding dance, there are few dance forms that are harder (perhaps Ballet and Flamenco). My advice to the viewer is to fast forward to the dance scenes - this way avoiding the waste of their time and being disappointed.

Woody Allen films though of a interesting nature and good quality seemingly often presents a one sided view of what is essentially existential liberal and intellectual as if his life revolves around what exists in a Cocoon.

Woody Allen perhaps Woody Allen closest to Dustin Hoffman in many ways is distinguished as even more insular where I would wish he broke out of his mold that is unique to him as a stylized artist who seems to have stopped expanding beyond what he has already done in his career.This title Husbands and Wives lives up to its title but it fails to expand beyond that subject matter 26 minutes into the film in its predictable formulaic nature which though thoughtful and provocative in that sense neither present entertainment nor any intellectual breakthrough in the sphere of the middle class life style.I want and demand significance and though this film is interesting but in that it fails to provide what I want and demand significance I am disappointed. This is not the three stooges nor peter Boyle. This is exclusively Woody Allen where I presume his productions are the products of his cloistered environment which means nothing to me except the world is pathetically mundane which would need to produce the dynamics of the working and under classes if there was no working and under classes that are sorely lacking in Woody Allen films.So 35 minutes into the film and I am still bored as the dynamics are insular subjective of a personal nature that seems to be lacking a social element similar in nature to Jane Austen but lacking the blunt social dynamics life is so full of.
