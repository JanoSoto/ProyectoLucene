(The makers of the Bounty chocolate bar have for decades centred their entire marketing strategy around this concept). In the twentieth century writers, such as William Golding in Lord of the Flies, Alex Garland in The Beach and J G Ballard in Rushing to Paradise, started to subvert this idea, but The Blue Lagoon, based on a novel from 1908, is a film which takes it largely at face value. The film is set in the late Victorian period. Two young children, Richard and Emmeline, survive a shipwreck in the South Pacific and are stranded on a lush tropical island along with a seaman named Paddy Button. Paddy dies not long afterwards, but not before he has taught the children the skills they need to survive on the island. Richard and Emmeline grow up and turn into beautiful teenagers, fall in love, and have a child of their own. At which point&#x85;&#x85; Well, you'll have to watch the film to find out what happens at this point. An earlier version of the story was filmed in 1949. It is a long time since I last saw that film, but I recall that (as one might expect of a film from the forties) it contains far less nudity and sexual activity than does the 1980 version. The 1980 film was, in fact, quite controversial, largely because the actress playing Emmeline, Brooke Shields, was only 14 years old at the time of filming. (Two years earlier, Shields had starred in the even more controversial Pretty Baby about a child prostitute). It was later revealed that body doubles were used in the sex scenes, but even so many people were shocked by the film's sexual frankness and especially by nude scenes which appeared to feature a girl so young. (One thing which aroused surprisingly little comment is the fact that Richard and Emmeline are first cousins, even though cousin marriage is illegal in many American states). The film was a success at the box office, probably because of its sexual explicitness and the good looks of its two young stars, but today it has a very dated feel. Much of the problem lies in the fact that its stars appear to have been cast on the basis of their looks alone, without regard to acting activity. Shields, in fact, had the dubious honour of winning the first ever Worst Actress Razzie. It may have been cruel to give such an award to a teenage girl (Farrah Fawcett-Majors probably deserved it more for Saturn Three), but it has to be admitted that Shields is not very good here. She had given a good performance in Pretty Baby, but the transition from child star to teenage star can be a difficult one, and here she seems horribly embarrassed and self- conscious and, moreover, does not always speak her lines clearly. It might have been better if an older actress aged about 18 or 19 had been cast in the role. Richard and Emmeline are supposed to be around the same age, but Shields is in fact four years younger than her co-star Christopher Atkins, and it shows. Casting an actress in her late teens would also have removed any controversy about underage nudity. As for Atkins, this was his first film. He has, apparently, gone on to enjoy a long acting career, although I do not recall seeing any of his later films; the only subsequent part I remember him in was as Sue- Ellen's toyboy in Dallas. His career has been much longer, I suspect, than many would have predicted for him on the basis of The Blue Lagoon, where he is very stiff and wooden, with little chemistry between him and Shields. The best acting performance comes from the veteran Leo McKern as Paddy, playing him as a mixture of kindly father- figure and drunken old reprobate; the film loses a lot of interest after his death relatively early on. There are a few holes in the plot. It appears that the island is inhabited by, or at least regularly visited by, a tribe of people (portrayed here, in the best politically incorrect fashion, as bloodthirsty cannibals), but it is never explained how these inhabitants manage to go at least ten years without discovering two strangers living on their island. It might have been more plausible if Paddy had remained alive for longer; the small children we see in the early scenes seem too young to be capable of surviving on their own. And how does Richard manage to stay so clean-shaven throughout? (Presumably the film-makers felt that a bearded Atkins would have seemed much less cute to the teenage girls who made up a large part of the film's intended audience). Visually, the film is an attractive one, with some striking photography of the island and its wildlife. The cinematographer Néstor Almendros was nominated for a Best Cinematography Oscar, the only nomination the film achieved. Overall, however, The Blue Lagoon is really no more than yet another sentimental teenage romance movie with an exotic setting and two miscast stars. Its only distinction lies in being possibly the only feature film to have made a greater contribution to science than to the arts. Some scenes were shot on a small island in Fiji, and a herpetologist watching the film realised that the iguanas featured were a species hitherto unknown to science. Today it is classified as the Fiji Crested Iguana (Brachylophus vitiensis); they should have called it Brachylophus bluelagoonii. 4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 October 2012","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Ever since at least the eighteenth century, the desert island, the uninhabited tropical island with golden beaches fringed with palm trees, has frequently been depicted in Western culture as the nearest one can get to paradise on earth, in literature, the cinema and even in advertising campaigns.

There is no fuss around the story, there are no sub plots, there aren't any superfluous scenes either. The plot is as simple as it gets.

This certainly doesn't happen because of the problems and challenges the protagonist faces. Its the liveliness and realism that each frame of the movie possesses that completely absorbs the viewer into it.The impact of the movie is accentuated because at the center of the plot lies a father-son duo.

What a brilliant piece of film making at display! It is close to impossible to better this piece of work for many reasons, most importantly because it would take an event of the order of WW II to be able to do that. Of course, one can recreate it through a period drama but you can not recreate what isn't real(or neoreal) anymore with the same effect. The movie depicts the social,economical and cultural panorama of Italy(focus on the lower\/middle class) which is still suffering from the after effects of the war and is trying hard to limp its way out of it. Vittorio De Sica shows it all without ever focusing on it but through a very simple story in the forefront. There is no fuss around the story, there are no sub plots, there aren't any superfluous scenes either. The plot is as simple as it gets. It's the reality of characters and the treatment given to the film that creates a winning combination. The skill of director is such that withing ten minutes into the movie, one starts to relate with the protagonist and empathise with his situation. This certainly doesn't happen because of the problems and challenges the protagonist faces. Its the liveliness and realism that each frame of the movie possesses that completely absorbs the viewer into it.The impact of the movie is accentuated because at the center of the plot lies a father-son duo. Its a relationship which is mostly understated be it the reel life or the real, which of course opens up the possibility of multiple layers. Once there is so much screen time available for this relationship to be portrayed, magic is always on cards, all it takes is a magician who can play the tricks right from his heart and for once not keep anything away from his audiences. This is exactly what Vittorio has been able to do here. If, like me you have also seen Life is Beautiful(1997) before Bicycle Thieves ,you will constantly be reminded of Bengini's masterpiece and which will in a way amplify the goodness of the experience.

Why? Because it was called The Greatest American Film of All Time. The first time I saw it, I was 12 years old, and I didn't even care about the movie. I just watched the movie and pointed out all the reasons why this movie sucked. To me, Citizen Kane was The Worst American Film of All Time. Then I saw the film again when I was like 16, and it was a little better. I then saw it the following year, and then I finally understood why it was called the greatest. After that third viewing, I finally had that appreciation for it that most film buffs have. There are many things that make this film the greatest. First of all, the cinematography is jaw dropping. This movie is so beautiful to look at; it almost brings a tear to my eye. The shadows, the angles, the camera movements, everything is just perfect. This may be the main reason why this film is considered to be the best, but there are other reasons too. Another great thing is the acting. This isn't typical 1940s acting; this is stuff that could still win Oscars today. The acting is so good, and the writing is so realistic, that it keeps you hooked from beginning to end. In fact, that's what made me love this movie. The story of Charles Foster Kane is just fascinating, and it's really interesting to see his story told through various flashbacks. The last thing that makes this movie so incredible is the impact it had. When this movie came out, it didn't do too well. In fact, it was like a cult movie years after its release. The film was based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, and he wasn't too pleased with what Welles was showing about his life (like his affair). Hearst wanted to have every print of this film destroyed, but Welles fought for it, and the rest is history. This really pushed the boundaries of freedom in cinema, and just knowing that makes it so much better. What I find very remarkable about this movie is legendary filmmaker, Orson Welles. This was his first movie, he was only 26 years old, and he wrote, directed, and starred in it. The man was a genius, and a true inspiration. Even if you don't want to admit this is the best movie ever made, that's fine. Even if you don't think it's the best, I don't think you can say it's a bad movie.

Most cinematic musicals of the period (Fame being a good example and Grease a rare exception) generally use spoken dialogue to convey emotion, with the characters only singing and dancing in situations where people would sing and dance in real life. Evita, however, goes to the opposite extreme. It is more like an opera than to a traditional musical, with little spoken dialogue, almost everything being sung.   Eva Perón was, and remains, a controversial figure, both in her native Argentina and internationally, but there can be little doubt that she was also a remarkable one. (I cannot imagine any other female political leader from Latin America who could have inspired a hit musical). Evita has always had a special interest for me, both as a stage production and as a film, because I used to have an Argentine girlfriend, and our first date was to see the stage version; she was able to explain a lot of the political background to me. Eva's husband Juan Perón is often thought of, at least in Europe and North America, as a fascist, but (as my girlfriend was quick to point out) there was a big difference between him and other Latin American leaders referred to by this term. The likes of Pinochet, Stroessner and Galtieri were military strongmen who ruled by force of arms; any support they might have enjoyed among the civilian population came largely from their countries' upper classes. Perón, by contrast, was a populist leader with links to the trade unions who enjoyed strong working-class support. Despite his military background he was distrusted by his fellow military leaders and loathed by Argentina's social elite, who saw him as a jumped-up demagogue. Although his regime was undoubtedly an authoritarian one, he was also responsible for instituting many social reforms, and the strength of his legacy can be gauged by the fact that since 1946, Peronist candidates have won eight of the ten Argentine presidential elections that they have not been banned from participating in; the current president, Cristina Kirchner, is a Peronist. Eva played an important role in her husband's rise to power, rallying his supporters when he was arrested by the military dictatorship, and during his time in office she was virtually canonised by the party faithful, who saw her as the spiritual leader of the nation. The film, like the stage musical, traces her life from her impoverished childhood, through her rise to fame as an actress, her marriage to Perón and her time as first lady to her tragic death from cancer at the age of 33. The film essentially tells the same story as the stage show, but makes two major changes. In the stage production, Eva leaves her first lover, the singer Agustín Magaldi; in the film he abandons her to return to his wife. The reason, it seems, is to make the young Eva a more sympathetic and vulnerable character, and possibly also to give Madonna the chance to perform one of the show's hit songs, Another Suitcase in Another Hall, which on stage is sung by Perón's mistress. The second major change concerns the character of Che, who here becomes an everyman figure and is not identified with the historical Che Guevara. (It is said that the left-leaning director Alan Parker made this change because he did not like the way Guevara, an idol of the Left, had been treated by the right-leaning lyricist Tim Rice). If anything, the Che of the movie is more of a disillusioned Peronist- we see him marching as one of the descamisados who sweep Perón to power- than a Communist. Madonna has not always struck me as the world's greatest actress, and it was a brave move on Parker's part to cast her here ahead of established actresses like Liza Minnelli and Michelle Pfeiffer. Although she had given decent performances in films like Desperately Seeking Susan and A League of their Own, she had also given some lousy ones, Body of Evidence being a notorious example. Parker's gamble paid off; Madonna had campaigned hard for the part, describing it as a role she was born to play, and was able to make good her boast. She gives here the greatest acting performance of her career, able to bring out all the contrasting sides of Eva's personality, making her not merely a strong and determined woman but also a vulnerable and tragic one. Madonna, of course, was a singer before she was an actress, so may have been helped by the fact that her role is almost entirely sung rather than spoken. Jonathan Pryce is also good as Perón, played here less passionate and less determined than his wife, but also a wily political opportunist. Antonio Banderas makes a charismatic Che, although I felt his singing voice was not always up to the role. The film's great strength, of course, is the combination of Rice's lyrics and Andrew Lloyd Webber's music, which combine to produce some of the most memorable songs in the modern musical theatre. Sometimes these are mordantly cynical (Oh What a Circus, Goodnight and Thank You, Peron's Latest Flame), sometimes lyrical and poignant.( Another Suitcase in Another Hall, Don't Cry for Me Argentina), and sometimes they manage to combine both moods (I'd Be Surprisingly Good for You). I should also mention Parker's direction and his ability to find striking visual images to complement the songs. Evita triumphantly proved that, even in the nineties, there was still life in the cinematic musical. A goof. We see Magaldi performing at a concert in 1944, which would have been clever of him, given that he died in 1938.

There were also British equivalents such as Blithe Spirit (which also starred Rex Harrison), A Matter of Life and Death and Pandora and the Flying Dutchman (this latter being from the early fifties). The film can, alternatively, be though of as a romantic comedy. Most rom-coms deal with the story of how a couple overcome an obstacle to their love, and in this case the obstacle seems a formidable one indeed- one of them is alive, the other dead. Although the film was shot entirely in California, it is set in Edwardian England. Lucy Muir, a beautiful young widow, moves into a seaside cottage with her young daughter Anna and her maid Martha. She discovers that the house is haunted by the ghost of its former owner, a sea captain named Daniel Gregg. Daniel initially seems like a difficult, testy character, but he soon shows that he has a decent, kindly side to his nature. When Lucy gets into financial difficulties he saves the day by dictating to her his memoirs of his seafaring life and allowing her to publish them and collect the royalties; when the book becomes a bestseller, Lucy becomes a wealthy woman. Lucy and the ghostly Daniel fall in love, but realise that theirs is a hopeless situation, and Lucy forms an attachment to Miles Fairley, a writer of children's stories. There were a number of contenders for the title of most beautiful film star of the forties (Ava Gardner, Jennifer Jones, Ingrid Bergman, Rita Hayworth, Lana Turner, Veronica Lake and others), but had I been a judge in a hypothetical Miss Hollywood contest, my vote would have gone to Gene Tierney. Although her British accent is not always spot-on, the lovely Gene makes an absolutely adorable heroine here. Rex Harrison (generally at his best in comedy, although he could also be good in serious films like The Agony and the Ecstasy) gives a good performance as the salty old seadog Daniel, playing him as a likable rogue. George Sanders was always a good villain, and here plays Miles as a suave but oily charmer; it comes as no surprise when (like a number of characters played by Sanders) he turns out to be an utter cad. There is also a good contribution from Edna Best as Martha; the young Anna is played by an eight-year-old Natalie Wood. (Like Elizabeth Taylor, Natalie was to become so famous as an adult that one forgets she started her career as a child star). I would not rate The Ghost and Mrs. Muir quite as highly as films like It's a Wonderful Life or A Matter of Life and Death, both of which have a greater depth and rank among the best films of the forties, but it is nevertheless a very enjoyable light fantasies.

But I will saw it was a decent movie to help start of the horror in the sound era.

Lawrence of Arabia is one of those movies (here I am not talking about child-adult joke partitioning popular among modern American full length cartoons). Up on the top you can clearly see the feat of a man alien to the local culture being able to gain respect, popularity and even loyalty among the people of the Arabia. Very well written dialogues and subtle acting deliver the deeper level containing some insights on the cultural conflict of that time between the East and the West particularly from the individual perspective. Often we hear remarks from Lawrence about the Arabian people his dual attitude is clearly shown. The centuries old argument on why the Arab world is seemingly underdeveloped has also been discussed. There are many other things that I think I noticed but it's not worth discussing them all here. That's why I advise the viewers watch the movie very carefully so that no detail is missed because in a movie of that quality almost no detail is redundant.

Cars 2 and Brave have been getting mixed reviews. While I think they are decent movies I do agree that they could have been better. However my favorite pixar film is not Toy Story Or Finding Nemo it is Monsters Inc.The film follows Sulley voiced by John Goodman and Mike voiced by Billy Crystal as they work a 9 to 5 job scaring children. One day a child they name Boo voiced by Mary Gibbs escapes to the monster world which could not only cost Sulley and Mike their jobs but could be deadly to the Monster world.This is an imaginative and fun film with gorgeous animation and very funny and talented writing.

It was so fast paced I'm sure I missed a thing or two, so I definitely think that this film deserves at least two views. The actors were a delight to watch, they commanded attention with their humorously overt dramatic interpretations, in other words they made it obvious that it was a comedy, but they also retained a certain desperation that resembled real life. Rosalind Russel was beautiful and made great use of her eyes and oval face and you could tell that they were all having great fun. I thought some of the really wacky over-the-top scenes were wonderfully staged and funny, it was full of laughs at every corner. It was artful comedy at its best, some of the jokes are still fresh in my mind and I definitely appreciated the sophistication, it didn't cater to my fast-food side, it was delicate and thoughtful.

Back in '05 when Peter Jackson's remake came out I went to the theatre to see it and really enjoyed it. The story was awesome, the setting was really amazing, and the CGI Kong was incredible. It wasn't until a few years later when I had wanted to see the original King Kong. I looked all over for it and once I finally had a copy of it (the original black and white, not the colorized version) I was ready for it...And personally, I think it blew the 2005 remake out of the water, no comparison. Of course, the original lacked a lot of the remake's special effects and vivid colors and whatnot, but that was to be much expected.But I really loved it. It was amazing to see how they pulled that off back in the 30s. The acting was fantastic, the camera direction was superb, and I was mesmerized by the scenery. Everyone should at least see this classic once in their lifetime. I know I plan on watching it again very soon...
