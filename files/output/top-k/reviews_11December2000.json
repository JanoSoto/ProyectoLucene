I have owned since it was on video. And I still love it. MK is arguably one of the best martial arts movies ever, perhaps THE best, because it blends REAL fighting to great atmosphere. It is far better than the Matrix, or more recently, Charlie's Angels, because of all the fighting is real, not wires and computer effects. The plot isnt great, but it's passable. The fight scenes are intense, more bone crunching than anything. I also love the movie for its moral. Im not into that in a movie, but if you learn something while watching a movie, hey, all the better. It basically says that you are what you are. To try. Never let anyone live your life. Everyone should be forced to see this movie. I honestly love it, and planning to buy it on DVD. Its probably my favorite movie of all time (battling against Happy Gilmore and Mystery Men) and sad it is overlooked. I love the game, and its faith to it is very respectable. It doesnt overdramatize its material (as in say, X-Men-which was a good movie) nor does it poke fun at it (the horrendous Street Fighter) or make it boring (Wing Commander...yeah, that was a movie) and it obviously appreciates its fans, rewarding them with the little things (Johnny's Friendship; Liu Kang's bicycle kick; the awesome Scorpion fatality) and the ending is fabulous. (although I found it one of the weakest fights-the way the fight started should have been the way it ended-although the Chan thing was a nice touch) I feel it could have been a little better with Kung Lao (hes mentioned a lot) and if Sub-Zero (one of my favorites) wasn't reduced to a supporting character. Its also really funny and tongue in cheek-(almost all scenes involving Johnny Cage with-hmm, any character). Although the sequel was VERY disappointing (it destroyed the story-line and fell victim to usual Hollywood traps-not to mention Rayden, Shoa Kahn and Sub-Zero sucked) the first is the best. I hear Paul Anderson is making the Resident Evil movie. Although Im not a fan of Resident Evil, and most people consider him a crock, I am anticipating another winner. Mortal Kombat rules the world. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 December 2000","score":"","review":"  I saw MK on opening weekend in August (17 I think) in 1995, when MK was all the craze.

Either it is a moderately successful attempt to be entertaining, or a really stupid excuse for a science fiction film. Paul Verhoeven's Total Recall is still the best film to ever be set on Mars, but with the competition that is out there right now, you could be forgiven for thinking this is only because nobody else can make a good one (this is not the case - Total Recall is excellent on its own merits).Things started off well enough. The explanation of what mankind has been doing up to the moment the film begins is concise, clear, and a plausible scenario, especially given the number of alternative engines that have been supressed in favour of the obsolete internal-combustion model. The flight to Mars was also well handled, with the usual arguments between crew members and methods used to cope with the isolation and boredom of being in the same spaceship for over six months being well handled. But something goes amiss once the crew reach Mars. SPOILER ALERT First of all, the solar flare. I realise that it would be hard to build a spacecraft that is everything-proof, especially when nobody has used one for the stated purpose before. But surely the designers would have anticipated some adverse environmental reactions from the planet and the solar radiation that bounces off it and made some allowances for it. After all, the whole mission supposedly carries the fate of humanity in its hands. If that was the sort of thing I was up against, I would have made sure the spacecraft could withstand the equivalent of a nuclear strike on an outdoor toilet.Then there's that landing module. I'm sure it was designed solely as an escape pod, but the first manned mission to the moon had better landing capabilities than that. People have rolled in cars for about a thousandth as many rotations and been killed by it, so the fact that only one astronaut comes out with a ruptured spleen while the others are perfectly fine is just an insult to the intelligence. A real group of human beings subjected to that much violent rolling and shaking would suffer too many complicated fractures for a single man to survive.Then there's AMEE. An exploration droid with an artifical intelligence that the astronauts must kill in order to get something necessary for their survival that is never mentioned again in the whole film. It then proceeds to go into battle mode and perform a series of ridiculous gymnastics in order to break a single astronaut's rib. I cannot remember the last time NASA built anything with a combat mode. Were they expecting to stumble onto the set of Total Recall or something? Had they cut this element out of the script before shooting and just stuck to the bugs, we would have had a much better film.Which brings me to the bugs. Bugs that eat the algae NASA tried to seed the planet with and excrete oxygen. A neat solution to the problem of oxygen limitations in the suits, but not a particularly credible one. The fact that these insectoid lifeforms also consume an unspecified tissue within the human body and excrete that as oxygen makes the AMEE robot all the more embarassingly redundant. And just how did they do all that damage to the colony structure that was set up for the astronauts' arrival? Do they eat steel and excrete that as oxygen as well? If they built AMEE in anticipation of hostile organisms, surely they would have been some kind of defense system into the colony.Don't even get me started on the method they use to escape Mars. The only thing I know of that was created in the 1970s that I expect to still work fifty years from that time is Black Sabbath's music.On the positive side, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, and Carrie Anne Moss do well with what little they have been given. Tom Sizemore in particular lifts the standard of the film from a self-contradictory mess to a watchable human drama. Val Kilmer was only a step above phoning in his performance, but he does give the other actors reasonable feedback to base their peformances on, which is not an easy task. Carrie Anne Moss was mostly redundant, but her interaction with the ship's computer kept the entertainment factor in the film from going to waste. The special effects were well realised, and Coober Pedy really is an excellent choice as a location to film events that supposedly take place on a desert planet. These elements keep Red Planet watchable, but that really is about it - watchable.
