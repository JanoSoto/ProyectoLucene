Obviously this isn't the right attitude to start watching a movie, but even from my most objective point of view imaginable, I still can't refer to this as a successful film. Cat's Eye is practically a one-man Stephen King show. Not only did he wrote the screenplay, with the adaptations of two previously published stories and one written directly for the screen, the film is also stuffed with obvious and not-so-obvious little references towards his other work. During the first opening minutes already, there are unsubtle winks towards Cujo, Christine and The Dead Zone. This might be interesting trivia for King-geeks to spot, but for people who think his work is over-hyped (like yours truly) it comes across as rather obnoxious. The three separate segments themselves are very lightweight and I'm having actually having a bit of trouble labeling Cat's Eye as a horror film. The first two stories are mildly enjoyable but very absurd, balancing on the verge of preposterous even, and the third one is downright childish. The cooler-than-cool James Woods saves the first segment, with his wondrous performance as a businessman who seeks the help of a curious company to quit smoking. The success rate of Quitters Inc. is incredibly, but that's because they indulge in extreme measures, like corporal punishment of the smoker's relatives. It's my favorite story of the film, thanks to James Woods and a pretty damn brilliant sequence where he's at a party, surrounded by extreme smokers but sensing the surveillance of Quitters Inc. The scene is terrific, thanks to the paranoia in James Woods' eyes and the use of The Police's classic song Every Breath You Take. Story number two is entitled The Ledge and has a reasonably interesting premise as well. An eccentric, gambling-addicted millionaire discovers that his wife is having an affair with a washed-up tennis athlete. He challenges his foe to a dangerous bet, a walk around the narrow ledge of his penthouse apartment, but obviously doesn't play fair. There's some suspense and effective black comedy in this segment, but it's nevertheless unmemorable and silly. The third and final story is actually derivative of both Gremlins and the famous Zuni-doll episode in Trilogy of Terror. 10-year-old Amanda suffers from the presence of a mini- monstrous jester (!) that lives inside the walls of her bedroom and attempts to steal her breath at night. Mommy doesn't believer her, but luckily enough Amanda receives protection from a stray cat. By the way, the cat is what connects the three stories as a whole. When astray in the streets of NY, the animal receives Amanda's cry for help. She immediately heads out to North Caroline, but gets forced to make a couple of unwanted stops at Quitters Inc. and in the millionaire's penthouse in New Jersey. Lewis Teague's direction is decent enough, but I guess that only Stephen King had fun making this movie. Cat's Eye rapidly gets dull and it's almost entirely scare-free. Fans of blood and make-up effects will be even more disappointed.

'Boogie Nights' is a superb effort in directing. It is a fully realized and brilliant film. What I admire most about Anderson's vision is the scope. He has created a fully constructed world and placed well rounded and interesting characters to inhabit it. The dialogue has spunk and bite and the picture is perfectly casted.Sex is hard to make a picture about, pure and simple. What makes 'Boogie Nights' a masterpiece in my opinion is that it portrays sex in such a blunt way. Whatever sense of spiritualism and individuality achieved through sex is completely gone from these characters. They merely go through the motions. If I had to choose a central motif of what Anderson tries to convey in this picture it would be the dehumanization of sex. Julianne Moore, who gives the finest performance of her career as Amber Waves, has a brilliant moment in the film when she first experiences 'penetration' with 'Dirk Diggler'. She asks Wahlberg's character to come inside her. I'm actually somewhat taken back from having to write this down but this is the crucial moment of the film. There is a line between bodily fluids and seed and 'Boogie Nights' plays with that line, debates it.One thing about 'Boogie Nights' though is that it doesn't damn the porno industry, nor should it. The Burt Reynolds character Jack Horner is brilliantly written and has clearly understandable motives. He views himself as an artist and why shouldn't he? One person's porn is another person's art. There is some sympathy to be felt when Horner's craft becomes nothing more than home videos. To go from the glory of celluloid to fuzzy home video is a long fall. Horner is in his own delusional world and is brought out in an extremely well crafted scene. Horner says that he will find the next adult film star on video tape. The scene leads to a rape of the adult film star 'Rollergirl' on fuzzy scratchy tape. It isn't art and it isn't 'sexy'.'Diggler' is nothing more than a stupid prop in these porn films. He didn't get to where he was with his acting skills. He has one thing in the world and it really is fascinating how Paul Thomas Anderson creates a character around that notion. 'Diggler' has to be a thoughtless tank for the picture to work. He has to have the base animal instincts of what sex is. It makes the picture all the more tragic for 'Diggler' to truly grasp even the slightest bits of maturity through whoring himself out. 'Diggler' is forced to go through hell. Anderson is blatant in his subtleties about what plaque 'Diggler' and his sex life. The character isn't really complete until the moment when he is paid next to nothing to jack off in a car. In many ways 'Boogie Nights' is a tragic film but I think it's more than that. It has an extremely satisfying conclusion where 'Diggler' questions his existence and his role in life better than almost any cinematic character that preceded him.

Murder by Numbers seems like it has all of the elements to make a good movie but it never turns into one. I can only guess that's because this is one of those films that gets significantly rewritten when a major star is cast in what should be a minor role, and too much of what was originally good about it gets lost in the process.When it started out, I imagine the script was largely about two teenagers. Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling) is the good looking rich kid who's annoyingly charming in that teenage douchebag sort of way. Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt) is the class outsider, very smart but emotionally undeveloped and hopelessly inept socially. The two are natural born high school enemies and act that way in class, but they're secretly friends in the male version of one of those too close relationships you sometimes see in young girls. In their hormonal angst, Richard and Justin and unified by their hatred and contempt of the world, their families and even themselves. So to prove how much smarter and better they are than everyone, the decide to commit the perfect murder.And this is where the rewriting must have set in, because one of the cops who investigates Richard and Justin's perfect murder is played by Sandra Bullock. So what was probably a minor role in the twisted story of two murderous teens gets blown up into the star of the movie with her own issues and her own backstory. Cassie Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) is your typical female film cop who is brilliant and conflicted and all that jazz. She's the one who figures out that Richard and Justin are really guilty and has to overcome the resistance of her boss and her partner who aren't smart enough to see it. Cassie's even got a tragedy in her past that's supposed to explain her reckless personal behavior and her instant animosity toward Richard.The problem is that in the probable expansion of Cassie's character, the whole story gets thrown out of whack. The movie is torn between being about her and being about the teen killers, so it ends up just going through the motions and being about nothing. It literally takes the film a half hour to establish what it's about. The supposedly complex murder scheme turns out to be child's play to unravel. Every development and revelation about Cassie or Richard and Justin happens at high speed, like something being cooked in a microwave oven. That's because the story of the lady cop and the killer teens are only tangentially connected, so any time spent on one is time taken away from the other.It's too bad because Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt do a pretty good job with roles that go beyond the stereotype of the smart kid being the brains and the rich kid being the ambition. I would have liked to have seen what they could have done with even meatier characters in a less melodramatic tale. Unfortunately for Sandra Bullock, it's hard to see Cassie as anything other than an attempt at a serious version of what she did in Miss Congeniality. But again, the character and her story have no real room to breathe, so it would have been hard to any actress to make it work. It is perversely amusing to watch Ben Chaplin playing Cassie's partner, because he's stuck in the same sort of thankless role thousands of actresses have had to play opposite a male movie star.Oh, and while the title of this movie is Murder by Numbers&#x85;numbers have absolutely nothing to do with the murder or anything else in the film. Richard and Justin don't use numbers to commit the murder. Cassie doesn't use numbers to solve it. I don't have the slightest idea what the title is referring to, unless the people at the studio in charge of naming movies had a massive case of writer's block and just decided to pair the always popular murder with the next thing that came to mind, just as the lottery drawing was being show on TV.Murder by Numbers isn't horrid.

A Nightmare on Elm Street is famous for being one of the most scariest and original horror movies ever to have been made. Many are scared to watch it, many love it but is it really scary? The answer in a nutshell yes. The story is brilliant and really captures the mind and imagination of Wes Craven and his filmmaking. The characters were brilliantly written and you cared for the teenagers and you hoped that they would get away from the clutches of the villain or defeat him. The character development involved in the movie was great as we see the main character Nancy turn from a defenceless, scared girl into a fighting, brave woman and we see her literally battle her demons. The acting was brilliant, especially Heather Langenkamp who played our heroine Nancy and Robert Englund who left his mark as the terrifying Freddy Krueger. The cinematography was fantastic, the direction was brilliant and the script was great. The nightmare scenes and the effects were executed magnificently as the cast and crew really pulled it off to make the movie scary and believable.I love this movie and this is probably my favourite horror movie.
