I thought it was THE perfect film . However today almost 20 years later Batman Begins and The Dark Knight have been released and I have realized that this movie has some flaws and as a Batman fan i appreciate this film less now than I did twenty years ago . However I still think that for a neutral cinema goer this film is Great and deserves a high rating. Before I start praising the film let me get the flaws ( big flaws, there were some other flaws but I don't think it's fair to mention them)  1. Who is Batman ? Why does Bruce Wayne, a billionaire dress up as a bat and fight crime at night ? OK his parents died when he was a child and then... ? Also as the Joker says ' Where does he get those wonderful toys ?' I don't even think the director knew how Batman really got his batmobile , batplane and all his gadgets ! 2. The Joker is Bruce Wayne's parents killer -big mistake it ruins Bruce Wayne's ambition to become Batman. 3. Batman Kills -HUGE MISTAKE 4. The plot was pretty weak compared to the Dark Knight. And finally  5. It is true that Bruce Wayne is a little crazy , what do you expect from a guy that dresses up like a bat ? But in Tim Burton's world he is borderline physco. From sleeping upside down (what was Burton thinking ?) to shouting 'Come on lets get nuts ! ' . Now that we got the flaws out of the way let us see why Batman is a great movie. 1. When you compare this film to the other 3 Burton\/Schumacher films it is the biggest 'Batman' movie out of all of them . 2. Michel Keaton was an excellent Batman despite being a shabby Bruce Wayne. He proved doubters wrong with an excellent and dark performance as Batman. 3. I had believed that Jack Nicholson played the Joker excellently however when compared to Ledger's Joker I had second thoughts. Still they are two completely different types of Jokers. Heath's portrayal is unique and only briefly seen in the darker comics. Jack's portrayal was more like the lighter comics were the Joker was seen more of a comedian than a psychopath but Jack still passes the role with flying colours. 4. Great and exciting action sequences which would look good even today. 5. Excellent portrayal of Gotham City as a city haunted by crime and corruption. 6. Great portrayal of other Batman characters namely Vicki Vale , Alexander Knox , The Major and Harvey Dent. I was abit disappointed with Commissioner Gordon , I though he should have been more included in the film but compared to his usage in other films I can't complain that much . 7. Excellent Bat mobile which is my favorite in the entire series (even Nolan's) 8. It was good to see the Joker's origin even though it is quite unrealistic. Anyway way guys when leaving the theater in 1989 I was in heaven , I Was delighted to see a hero who I had followed on the comic book be put on the big screen in such a professional way . I couldn't wait for more sequels to come out but as you know there were not as I expected . Today 'Batman' still remains the best of the Burton\/Schumacher film series but when you compare it to the Nolan series there is a big difference. But when you see Batman for the first time like I did back in 1989 you'll be completely blown away by a movie which is a thrill ride from start to finish 8.1\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"3 January 2009","score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" When Batman came out in 1989 I was completely blown away by it and was taken away by the fact that I was finally seeing my childhood hero on the big screen.

Most of the time it just isn't mentioned. But I feel it is one of the best movies in the film noir genre(not that I am an expert in this genre!). It is not just a thriller. It is in fact a movie which portrays the 1950's effectively in such a way that we are transported to that 1950's era of race relations, gender relations and the general corruption in society. It is a battle of personalities and attitudes.The story is quite complex and it took me some time to figure it all out. Murders at the Nite Owl, a bar in Los Angeles, are the focus of the story. There are many disparate events that happen in the movie which are somehow connected. They are joined together at the end in an effective manner which doesn't defy logic. That is quite rare in movies today. It moves like a classic whodunit(one of my favourite genres) and is generally the kind of movie I like. The character development is of high priority here and the characters are neatly fleshed out before the actual story begins. Each scene is important here and each little point is important to the resolution of the mystery. I think repeated viewings might bring out some more details that I missed the first time. The story also involves a prostitute who falls in love with one of the characters. She has a very important role in this movie.The main characters are three detectives named Ed Exley(Guy Pearce), Bud White(Russell Crowe) and Jack Vincennes(Kevin Spacey). Their conflicting ideals and attitude to life are perfectly portrayed. My favourite character in this movie is Ed Exley with his pacifist and intelligent attitude to police work. My favourite line in the movie Is that how you ran the good cop bad cop after an intense scene has now become one of my favourite lines. His steadfast devotion to his ideals and standing up to the system was pleasing to watch. I personally believe that this performance was better than his Memento performance because of the complexity and likability of his character. Russell Crowe as Bud White gives a sterling performance as the tough cop who is not amused with Exley's approach to law enforcement. It may be a clichéd performance as the tough guy with a softer side but he does a good job. Kevin Spacey, as usual, is great in this role as the cop, Jack Vincennes, who loves publicity and glamour. He is more complex than he initially appears in this movie. Kim Basinger as the prostitute named Lynn Bracken also has a good part where she looks sexy as ever(hard to believe she is 40 in this). She gives a worthy performance and she is one of the pivotal characters in this movie.The best thing about the movie is the dialogue. It has a clever style reminiscent of 1940's film noir classics. The movie has a relaxed style throughout with flashes of violence which erupt suddenly. Some of the scenes can stun you as they suddenly come out of nowhere. The relaxed style is what makes the violent scenes seem even more violent. The newer filmmakers must learn from this in the new era where they try to shock people with more violence upon violence. The music is another factor that gives it a 1950's feel. The viewer sometimes may feel helpless at the racism and the police officers attitude towards Exley(at least I did). It is not just a cold lifeless murder mystery but instead it is a vibrant look at the dark seedy underbelly of Los Angeles and the helplessness of a man who holds tightly to his ideals. The scene where he tries to hold back the other officers in the police station brawl is a great example. Overall, highly recommended to people who like detective stories and people who like film noir. But even others who just love good stories with complex characters should enjoy this movie.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"3 January 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" It is funny how ignored this movie is today.

Compared to the first movie this one adds very little new and originality.Seems like the only reason why they put Natasha Henstridge in this movie was to connect this movie with the first one. Her character is a totally better one this time and quite frankly I think the movie and particularly its story would had been better off without it. It would had also made this movie more fresh and original to watch. 2 other actors from the fist movie also re-appear in this one; Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger. Michael Madsen is basically always awesome to watch in any movie and any type of role he plays. He is a pleasant addition to this movie, even though of course its far from his best movie role, which is also due to its silly script and poor dialog. The chemistry he had with Helgenberger in the first movie is also completely gone in this movie.Seriously the writing of this movie is so lazy. Her we have an alien that is being hunted down, who is inside the body of the first man who walked on Mars. That makes him about the number one most famous face of the world, yet he can walk around freely and the military and all secret agencies have a hard time tracking them down. Really not the most believable and likely plot premise. The movie is filled with some other holes and big improbabilities.There also are some new characters appearing in this movie, not played by the least actors. Mykelti Williamson, George Dzundza and James Cromwell are some well known names. There also is a quite nice little cameo by Richard Belzer as the U. S. president, which is quite fun if you know Richard Belzer. Unfortunately none of the great actors can really spice up the movie its script.The movie obviously had a lesser budget to spend this time. At times the movie even looks like a made-for-TV movie, which also might be due to the fact that director Peter Medak has a lot of experience with TV movie and not as much with big theatrical movies, even though he is capable of something better. Just watch the 1980 horror movie The Changeling. Despite that all, the movie its effects are all quite nice looking and the movie also has some good looking gore to shock with. What the movie is lacking though is its good eerie atmosphere of the first movie. It also makes Species II a less effective movie to watch.Also having a male alien this means a less seductive and therefore at the same time also less interesting movie to watch.It has some good elements and nice moments but basically you overall are better off by just sticking to the original.5\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"3 January 2009","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" It's not an horrible movie but it surely is a pointless one.

Compared to the first movie this one adds very little new and originality.Seems like the only reason why they put Natasha Henstridge in this movie was to connect this movie with the first one. Her character is a totally better one this time and quite frankly I think the movie and particularly its story would had been better off without it. It would had also made this movie more fresh and original to watch. 2 other actors from the fist movie also re-appear in this one; Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger. Michael Madsen is basically always awesome to watch in any movie and any type of role he plays. He is a pleasant addition to this movie, even though of course its far from his best movie role, which is also due to its silly script and poor dialog. The chemistry he had with Helgenberger in the first movie is also completely gone in this movie.Seriously the writing of this movie is so lazy. Her we have an alien that is being hunted down, who is inside the body of the first man who walked on Mars. That makes him about the number one most famous face of the world, yet he can walk around freely and the military and all secret agencies have a hard time tracking them down. Really not the most believable and likely plot premise. The movie is filled with some other holes and big improbabilities.There also are some new characters appearing in this movie, not played by the least actors. Mykelti Williamson, George Dzundza and James Cromwell are some well known names. There also is a quite nice little cameo by Richard Belzer as the U. S. president, which is quite fun if you know Richard Belzer. Unfortunately none of the great actors can really spice up the movie its script.The movie obviously had a lesser budget to spend this time. At times the movie even looks like a made-for-TV movie, which also might be due to the fact that director Peter Medak has a lot of experience with TV movie and not as much with big theatrical movies, even though he is capable of something better. Just watch the 1980 horror movie The Changeling. Despite that all, the movie its effects are all quite nice looking and the movie also has some good looking gore to shock with. What the movie is lacking though is its good eerie atmosphere of the first movie. It also makes Species II a less effective movie to watch.Also having a male alien this means a less seductive and therefore at the same time also less interesting movie to watch.It has some good elements and nice moments but basically you overall are better off by just sticking to the original.5\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"3 January 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I just saw this movie again tonight, after six years. More than ever, I think the people who panned it when it first came out (and since) are not making much sense.This is a fine movie, just as a movie. True, some of it won't make a lot of sense if you've never seen any Star Wars films (are there any such people on Earth?). And as chapter one in six chapters, I think it is excellent. It lays the foundation well. Some people complained that we don't know much about Qui-gon. True, but what do you want -- yet more prequels? You've got to start somewhere.If you are at all aware of the original three movies and the buildup to this one, I don't see how you can criticize this one because Annikan is a boy. Of course he's a boy -- that's the whole point, to start at the beginning. Unlike some posters here, I liked that his mother called him Anny. The diminutive is perfectly appropriate. Is his mother supposed to know that he will turn out to be a fearsome figure? His being a slave, with his mother, is a fine idea. His having no father around makes good psychological sense. That there was in fact no father is nice symbolism. I didn't find it hokey. It could also tie in somewhat with Qui- gon's explanation of the force as being produced by micro-organisms. And I for one am very glad to have a rational explanation of the force, even a rather unlikely one as this. Someone posted that this makes it too scientific, less mysterious. Duh! It IS a science fiction movie after all. We need all the rationality and science we can get these days. The last thing we need is more Harry Potter type mumbo jumbo and supernatural baloney.I liked the pod racing and the character of Darth Maul, as others have commented. And Jar-Jar? Maybe he wasn't perfect, and yes I had trouble getting all his dialog, but so what? The underwater city was very cool, and the trip through the planet was cool. He was meant for comic relief and to appeal to the kids. Fine. I also thought Natalie Portman did a great job portraying the Queen. Sometimes she did seem stiff, but, hey the queen is very young and no doubt a bit uptight and overly serious.I suspect that most of the people who wrote negative reviews and seemed to be so disappointed by this movie were kids in 1977 when the first one came out. You're not going to get that feeling back, not with this movie or any. I was a young adult in 1977, so maybe I can be a bit more measured about it. I loved the first movie then, both for its own merits and for the fact that the previous decade had been rather dismal for movies --too much cynicism, too much intellectualizing, too little imaginative, adventurous fun. In 1999 I looked forward to this movie as rejuvenating the franchise and rekindling a lot of adventurous fun. This movie succeeds in that.-- henry ","genre":null},{"date":"3 January 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I just saw this movie again tonight, after six years.

They captured the campy humor of the comics perfectly, with lovable corny one-liners done just well enough to be corny, but not excessively that it becomes a joke.**At it's core, this movie is basically a love story about a nerd awkwardly trying to win over the girl he loves, with things getting a tad bit complicated having to deal with the fact that he's got superhuman powers. This is a romance story story running parallel to a superhero movie, and it's interwoven with expert craftsmanship, it completely engrosses you.**I've gotta give it to Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, they did some great acting here.

His wit and injection of satire into his work has made him one of my favorite writer\/directors. In his films he often portrays a highly structured society that is cold and pedantic, stifling freedom and imagination. In Baron Munchausen, he uses an enormous budget from Columbia Pictures to create a vivid adventure in the late 18th century during the Age of Reason. Seemingly disdainful about this designation, he once again satirizes government and society, its cruelness, pettiness, and vanity, and the apparent loss of imagination to logic and reason.The story is highly fantastical and absurd, with an adventurer, Baron Munchausen, traveling the world in search of his old crew to end a war that he started long ago. Along the way he will go to the Moon and talk to the moon king, whose unique dichotomy of animalistic instinct and intellectual aspiration satirize the powerful. He will fall inside a volcano, meet the God Vulcan and the Goddess Venus, and later get swallowed up by a giant fish. This may sound great, and it certainly is. The reason this movie is not a 10\/10, however, is due to some unfortunate weaknesses throughout.

I was prepared to be enthralled by a work of high art with a meaningful message and I happily settled into my couch to watch. Three hours later I realized I'd just wasted three hours of my life. Zhivago is not epic, nor is it high art, nor does it deliver a message other than Man, it's frickin' cold in RussiaWhy?1. One-dimensional wooden acting with all the depth of a remedial high school drama class. I expected better from Lean. He did not deliver. The only actor in the movie to even be nominated for an Oscar that year was Tom Courtenay, likely for the wonderfully impressive wax scar he sports.2. Waaaaay too many dewey-eyed close ups of Omar Sharif's cocker spaniel eyes. Oh wait! Sharif -does- manage to show a level of depth by employing two disarmingly complex Method Acting modes though--teary-eyed AND moist-eyed. Oh, the drama. It would be interesting to count how many shots there are of Sharif looking off into the distance while tearing up. This could be a great drinking game if you took a shot every time Lean inflicted this poor excuse of character development upon the viewer as you'd be quite intoxicated by the end of the movie.3. A stunningly repetitive musical score that is jammed down the viewer's throat at every opportunity---and I mean every opportunity whether it fits the scene or not. Many times the music simply did not fit the action, yet it was forcibly played in order to remind us of something. Something....what? Oh yeah, that you're watching this terrible movie. 4. Too many storyline coincidences requiring too much suspension of disbelief. 5. The use of mirror shots--at first--was well-done. But then Lean went on and on using mirrors to show character's faces that it grew weird and tedious. Had his DP just graduated film school?6. The sound design was not well-done. I had a very hard time hearing dialog and eventually resorted to sub-titles.Watch Reds if you want a great movie about the Russian Revolution. Dr. Zhivago was a great disappointment.

HOOK, released a year or so after ALWAYS, is Spielberg's big budget disappointment packed with some astonishing special effects, imaginative settings, colorful costumes, a big cast and a helluva budget. Unfortunately, its also bogged down by a half-baked story and potential that is never really fulfilled. Although bubbly and colorful, we're expecting more from a $70 million-worth production. Actually, with its elaborate settings and appealing charms, I actually loved HOOK as a kid. But after seeing it again one night, after all these years, HOOK hasn't aged real well. For a movie directed by one of the most reliable men at Hollywood, HOOK is quite a disappointment. Though sometimes, the imagination that went to the production design and special effects are noteworthy.Peter Pan has grown up. Now Peter Banning (Robin Williams) married, successful, and a workaholic, Peter is no intention, or even memory at all, about his past as The Boy who Never Grew Up. But when his kids are kidnapped by his old nemesis, the evil Capt. James Hook (Dustin Hoffman, serving up a loaf of ham), Peter has no choice but to head back to Neverland, be sprayed again by Pixie dust, courtesy of his old friend Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts, slightly uncomfortable), and reclaim his forgotten destiny. The story seemed fine on paper, and I actually like how the story is. It's how it goes that isn't very good. In addition to Spielberg's decline on overdone slapstick humor (the film does cost a lot, so why not spend it?), they also throw in a band of annoying, screaming Lost Boys who look more like they escaped from an audition from a GOONIES sequel. Other than that, Spielberg doesn't have much control on a few scenes, which are either tedious (when the film requires the characters to talk) or downright overcooked (the boys tormenting Pan with all sort of pie-on-the-face mayhem).HOOK, however, earns points for the creativity and imagination devoted on special effects, costumes and set designs.

For the record, all my money was on Vera Claythorne (June Deprez) for most of the film. It's always the person whom you least suspect, was my reasoning, and nobody ever suspects the pretty young lady. But, of course, Agatha Christie had already foreseen my logic, and deftly maneuvered her tale around it. Even in the final seconds before the reveal, I threw away all rationale, and, in a fit of desperation, announced that the killer was actually the British sea-man who had brought the ten people to the island. I was wrong. 'And Then There Were None (1945)' boasts a murder mystery that nobody could possibly have deciphered in ninety minutes, and, even if a viewer did guess correctly, it's only because the gods of probability were kind to them. Who among the ten is a murderer, you say? Well, nearly all of them, as a matter of fact. In this Agatha Christie adaptation, a criminal mastermind doles out justice against sinners whose wrongdoings have until now gone unpunished, and punishment is ultimately enjoyed by all who deserve it.Watching René Clair's murder mystery unfold, one can't help but be reminded of the slasher horror sub-genre that first gained eminence in the 1970s. You've got ten people stranded in a remote location, far from outside intervention, among them stalking a killer who discretely but reliably retires the guests one at a time. Everybody is under suspicion, for there can be no trust between complete strangers. That, at least, was the idea behind Agatha Christie's original novel (tastefully published as Ten Little N!ggers in 1939), which I haven't read myself, but ends with the eradication of all ten guests. 'And Then There Were None' instead concludes with the ending used in Christie's theatrical version of the story, which was apparently revised to provide comfort to war-weary audiences. Two of the visitors (the youngest and most attractive actors, of course) have, it seems, been falsely accused of their crimes, and so are free to fall in love, outwit the murderer and live happily ever after. It's a less interesting conclusion, I think, but, by 1945, America deserved some optimism.Stylistically, there's nothing particularly notable about Clair's film adaptation. There's enough sinister lighting to evoke the required atmosphere, but nothing that we haven't seen before. Instead, the bulk of the emotional power arises from the scenario devised by Agatha Christie herself, and one receives a certain icy chill whenever a character suddenly realises that they've only one companion in the room. The acting is top-notch from Barry Fitzgerald, Walter Huston, Louis Hayward and Judith Anderson, but some of the other players have a tendency to overreact. Let's just say that I'm glad Prince Starloff (Mischa Auer) was the first to choke himself, for the character was gratingly hammy. Also, though I have no particular complaints about Roland Young as Detective William Blore, he might just be the most dim-witted detective I've ever seen. So put on your deer-stalker hat, keep your magnifying glass at hand, and see if you can decode this perfectly baffling mystery. I bet you that you won't guess who the murderer is &#150; or, at least, I'll give you 10-1 odds.

Robinson and a handful of goons take over a hotel on the Florida keys. The hotel is run by Lionel Barrymore and his widowed daughter-in-law, Lauren Bacall. Humphrey Bogart, the hotel's only guest, is an ex-soldier who was a friend of Bacall's husband during the war. The plot involves chiefly the conflict between Robinson, the boss who knows exactly what he wants, and Bogart, who lost any ideals he might have had during the war in Italy. A secondary story has the minions of the law running in and out searching for a pair of miscreant Seminoles. The drama is heightened by the arrival of a dangerous hurricane at the end of the second act.The movie is resolutely middle brow. Everything you need to know is spelled out for you. What does Robinson really want? More. And does Bogart know what HE wants? I used to have dreams but I gave them up. (Something like that.) This isn't high drama. This is vernacular art. Every character we meet is either good or evil. Oh, I suppose Bogart has some doubts about being a hero, but we know what will happen before the end of the movie rolls around.The single exception is Gaye Dawn (nee Maggie Rooney), played by Claire Trevor, whose character is reasonably complex and who shows some development that isn't entirely predictable. She won an Academy Award for her performance, and she deserved it. Not just for the scene in which she, as a pathetic drunk, agrees to sing Moanin' Low for a shot of scotch, but for the far more subtle ways in which she signals her character's thoughts and emotions. Her slightest glances are given meaning.The movie is shot by director Huston mostly as a staged play. It's just as well because the special effects, mostly models, seen during the hurricane are pretty sleazy by today's standards. It's far spookier with everyone scattered around the hotel lobby, the bad guys shaking in their boots, listening to the wind ululate, staring at the swinging chandeliers and gaping as the walls practically billow inward, tumbling the liquor glasses off the shelves behind the bar.Is there a moral in tow? Nah. Not really. Bogart learns that the war was worth fighting. Robinson, who is playing Lucky Luciano in the closet, learns that you can't kill Nature with a bullet. Robinson is great, by the way. Huston has him made up to look like a caricature of himself. I swear he's wearing lip rouge. And he's got those lips wrapped around a huge phallic cigar when Huston introduces him. He's given a chance to sneer Mnyeah a couple of times too. He resembles the cartoon figure of himself that appeared occasionally in the Bugs Bunny shorts that Warners produced. You have to love it when he whispers inaudible obscenities into the unsullied ears of the rapturously beautiful Bacall.The dialog, which I take it comes mainly from Maxwell Anderson's play, sounds as if it were written by a guy who knows absolutely nothing about real gangsters of the 1920s and 30s, although he may have seen many movies about them. Say, boss, I wonder if it was such a good idea to leave Dawn behind. She might squeal. And, I betcha prohibition comes back, only this time the mobs will work together instead of blastin' each other. At the end, when the stage of ejaculatory inevitability is reached and Bogart improbably offs all the bad guys while at sea, he radios Nan Mike Able for assistance. That was the U. S. Coast Guard radio station in Miami. Then there is a cut back to the hotel, where Bacall gets a phone call from Bogart telling her he's coming back. Then another cut to Bogart -- smiling but still at sea in the Santana. How do you make a phone call from a fishing vessel? Especially when the phone is dead? (What, then, did the hand of the potter shake?)Immensely enjoyable stuff.

Robinson and a handful of goons take over a hotel on the Florida keys. The hotel is run by Lionel Barrymore and his widowed daughter-in-law, Lauren Bacall. Humphrey Bogart, the hotel's only guest, is an ex-soldier who was a friend of Bacall's husband during the war. The plot involves chiefly the conflict between Robinson, the boss who knows exactly what he wants, and Bogart, who lost any ideals he might have had during the war in Italy. A secondary story has the minions of the law running in and out searching for a pair of miscreant Seminoles. The drama is heightened by the arrival of a dangerous hurricane at the end of the second act.The movie is resolutely middle brow. Everything you need to know is spelled out for you. What does Robinson really want? More. And does Bogart know what HE wants? I used to have dreams but I gave them up. (Something like that.) This isn't high drama. This is vernacular art. Every character we meet is either good or evil. Oh, I suppose Bogart has some doubts about being a hero, but we know what will happen before the end of the movie rolls around.The single exception is Gaye Dawn (nee Maggie Rooney), played by Claire Trevor, whose character is reasonably complex and who shows some development that isn't entirely predictable. She won an Academy Award for her performance, and she deserved it. Not just for the scene in which she, as a pathetic drunk, agrees to sing Moanin' Low for a shot of scotch, but for the far more subtle ways in which she signals her character's thoughts and emotions. Her slightest glances are given meaning.The movie is shot by director Huston mostly as a staged play.
