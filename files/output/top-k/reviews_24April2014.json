A group of experts are gathered in Paris by Deirdre (Natascha McElhone) who is looking to steal a mysterious suitcase. The group (Robert DeNiro, Jean Reno, Stellan Skarsgård, Sean Bean, Skipp Sudduth) don't know each other and don't trust each other. The plan is very sketchy, and Deirdre won't tell them what's in the suitcase.Director John Frankenheimer shows that he still has a bit of juice left in him. The best thing about this movie is the class of acting talents he is able to get. Robert DeNiro is superbly brilliant. Jean Reno is absolutely solid, and Sean Bean puts in a nice turn. The objective is almost unimportant. This is about a bunch of great actors playing around with some mysterious characters. Each of whom may turn out to be something less than reliable.
