[{"date":"31 October 2003","score":"","review":"  Personally, I found this movie hard to watch because I couldn't find anyone to root for. Sure, Mike was a bit more honorable than Worm, but even he was hard to like. I found myself in big scenes pulling for characters like KGB, who at least had the decency to know that all he was was a gambler. He didn't pretend to be anything else. Seems like I saw all this in The Hustler, and I liked Fast Eddy Felson a lot better than either Mike or Worm. Minnesota Fats was a better character than KGB, also. Getting your thumbs broken is a whole lot more imaginative than just getting beaten up and thrown out. Take my advice and see The Hustler, if you've never seen it before, and avoid this movie.

I thought was mediocre at best and at worst saccharin, predictable, neatly cathartic and only mildly believable. I think that if it didn't contain the rape scenes, it would have been so sweet that I would have turned it off before I regurgitated. This is not to say that I enjoyed those scenes - I didn't - but it appeared that it was Frank Darabont's sophomoric attempt at instilling some sense of prison reality into an otherwise boring story about male bounding. I personally would not recommend this movie to anyone.
