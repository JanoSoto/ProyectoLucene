First of all, I love Richard Pryor and he has a field day in this movie. Secondly, I love Robert Vaughn, and he plays a really juicy villain in this one.

My only complaint was not enough Lois Lane (Margo Kidder) and maybe I'm nitpicking, but continuity with the other two films seems to be ignored completely. According to this entry in the series, Clark graduated from Smallville high in 1962. The problem with that is that in the first film, is clear that when Clark is in high school, it's the late 1940s by the vintage cars and trucks in the scenes. But hey, if we can believe that a man can come from another planet, fly, see through walls, burn through things with his eyes and lift trains into the air then why bitch about little things like continuity?Not only do I have this baby on video from cable TV, but I also taped the network version just for the outtakes and edited out every single commercial. (The beautifully choreographed opening credits with the blind man, some mechanical penguins on fire and more is even longer and better in the TV version.)So hate this one if you must, but I will take it over the second film any the day of the week.

One article said that it would be easy to introduce the rice into Eastern cultures, because of the way the traditional Eastern cultures viewed food as a sacred thing, especially rice. I seem to remember that certain rices, usually based on the color, were reserved for different things. I think dark rice was served during ceremonies or as a signal of an upperclass status. But the point was, that certain cultures view food as such a holy, sacred thing that other cultures may not.That's what Tampopo is all about, the beauty of food. Kind of reminds me of Cibbo Motto's first album, Vive La Woman where ever song is about food. In Tampopo, we may start with Tampopo's painstaking quest to be the best noodlemaker, but eventually, we get little strings of skit-like stories interspersed throughout the picture showing the different ways food is valued. In the beginning, for example, the film opens up in with a couple in a theater, and the man in the white suit talking about how he didn't like to be disturbed by the sounds of crinkling bags of potato chips and other assorted theater food. Meanwhile, he and his date are being served quite a fine feast (considering they're only in a theater) when they arrive at the theater. Something unusual for me as well funny, and as you will see in the rest of the movie, something completely different. You may never look at food the same again.The main story is that of Tampopo, a noodlemaker at Lai Lai. One night a visitor, Goro, stops in her restaurant and gives her advice about the quality of her soup. In sort of a parody of Rocky, Goro trains her to be the best noodlemaker in a way that the Lai Lai into a temple of noodles. She starts to meet people along the way who are noodle masters themselves who will train her how to take care into each noodle and so forth. So precise and everything else. As the story continues, we see a master and his trainee learning how to eat a bowl of soup. The rituals, the caressing of the meat with the chopsticks, and all of that. We see the couple who place a sensuous value upon food, using it somewhat as a substitute for actual sex. We see a man who's wife is on her deathbed, but manages the strength to get up and cook rice for the family before dying. We see a series of homeless vagrants who tell Tampopo about all the exciting foods and beverages they've been working on. They describe brilliant French cuisines and one man even notes that he's worked fifteen years on perfecting a type of sake. In another part of the film, we briefly see some Japanese businessmen in a restaurant.

I think this movie is pretty funny for us American audiences because the idea seems so stupid everyone is so serious about food. Asian cultures may look at this differently, and find it funny because of things the characters say (like the dentists who remove a man's absess in his tooth and have to run to the window because it smelled so bad), knowing that they too, hold food in the same value.

In the original, Here Comes Mr. Jordan, the main character was a boxer. In Heaven Can Wait he was an American Football player. In Down to Earth, he's a comedian. However, being a comedian isn't so much what it rides on, it's that he's black, and this is what permeates the film.Hence a movie that's largely populated by humour that plays on the oh-so-funny (supposedly) differences between white and black people, and the culture clash as a black delivery driver takes the body of a rich white man. But for me, the humour is very broad. Like a white businessman singing to black rap music -- it's simplistic, moderately amusing but really nothing special. Take this formula, repeat it many times, and that's this film.Everything else in the movie is put in, but nothing gels. From the murderous lovers who just seem completely irrelevant to the movie, to the non-entity that is Eugene Levy's character (and we know this guy can do some great stuff with his material, if he's given it).Then there was the obligatory romance. There were just so many pointed references as to how she liked his eyes and the person inside -- making it quite clear that a hot, strong woman couldn't like the old fat man that she was seeing. So the comments kept coming, all too cutesey and clever, a wink-wink to the viewers at home. Her character was literally apologising to us for kissing him at times.The movie was very short too, just an hour and fifteen minutes, and all in all the movie just felt half-hearted. It had its small moments, and for me Wanda Sykes stole the show (not that there was a lot of show to steal). But all in all, the movie wasn't anything special. I didn't hate it, and you could watch worse things out there. But certainly you shouldn't feel the need to go out of your way to see it either.

In the original, Here Comes Mr. Jordan, the main character was a boxer. In Heaven Can Wait he was an American Football player. In Down to Earth, he's a comedian. However, being a comedian isn't so much what it rides on, it's that he's black, and this is what permeates the film.Hence a movie that's largely populated by humour that plays on the oh-so-funny (supposedly) differences between white and black people, and the culture clash as a black delivery driver takes the body of a rich white man.

So when it is told again, the new version generally needs to have something to set it apart. The problem with The Untouchables is that it doesn't have a whole lot to set it apart from any mob story, leave alone one based on the life of Al Capone.In this effort, Capone is played with gutso by Robert De Niro, who seems to be every director's first choice for a mobster film. De Niro plays the legendary figure as a fat, arrogant bastard. Whether this is accurate or not, De Niro plays it so well that it really doesn't matter. It is so easy to believe in his Capone that in a way, it makes the film.The same cannot be said of Kevin Costner, who gets to play famed lawman Eliot Ness. In 1987, when Costner was a relatively unknown actor, it was a lot easier to believe in this portrayal. But as Costner's projects got grander and grander in scale, a certain kind of trend was noticed. In essence, the manner in which Costner portrayed Eliot Ness was more or less identical to how he has played in every film since. Even The Postman or 3000 Miles To Graceland have him displaying little, if any, variation from his standard stock character. Under these conditions, casting Sean Connery, a veteran of playing every character in such a manner that they cannot be distinguished, seems like an incredibly bad move, even if he raises the acting above the level of a TV drama.Spare a thought for Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith. Their roles are so underdeveloped that they often exist merely to provide an extra gun or some plot movement. Although it is kind of amusing when the accountant starts showing a good dose of the Rambo-syndrome, the next scene when Connery uses a corpse to gain information from one of the few survivors on the mob side shows a kind of energy that, as Ebert so eloquently put it, the rest of the film lacks.Credit where credit is due. The world of the 1930s is very effectively reproduced here. Even if you've only seen the so-called golden era in photos, it's hard to escape how convincingly it is recreated in each frame of the film. Unfortunately, it makes the general unconvincing nature of the rest of the film all the more difficult to understand. One can't help but ask if anyone's heart was in it.In all, I am giving The Untouchables a five out of ten. I would have given it a six, but Robert De Niro's set pieces also seem so cut off from the rest of the film that one can't help but wonder if they were put in as an afterthought.

I thought it looked intriguing and wanted to see it, but I couldn't figure out why my brother was going berzerk splitting a side over the commercial (he ROARED the moment they showed the now-famous Ghostbusters logo and shrilled, Isn't that logo HILARIOUS??? I liked the logo, but I didn't think it funny).Unfortunately, the movie came out at a time when I was expected to buy all my own stuff since I had a paper route. And that particular time period I was busy raising up money for a new stereo. So as a result, I was disappointed when the movie left town before I had gotten to see it. And I had sighed, WOW, for a huge hit movie, THAT was sure gone fast.For the next year or two, I was forced to endure everybody else's comments about how hilarious and wonderful this movie was. But whenever I asked what had happened in it, they never answered me. All I got was, You've just GOT to see it, words don't do it justice, it's HILARIOUS and it's SO COOL!Well, during that time I had learned a few of the basics, such as the uniforms and the gadget packs their wore, but that was about it since nobody answered my questions. Fortunately, the movie was being brought back for a brief run in movie theatres before they released it to home video (back then, movies didn't get automatically released on to video a few months after theatrical release the way they are today--you had to wait a few years and then MAYBE if you were lucky it would be). I got all anxious to see it, raised a bit of money once I had gotten finished paying for everything else I had needed to take care of that month--and it was gone from the theatres again! Another groan of frustration from me. I thought, Why can't the local movie house at LEAST keep it here for a MONTH or so???But then, FINALLY--around early 1987, I think--GHOSTBUSTERS was finally released to home video among a huge flurry of hype. And a friend of mine had managed to rent it one night while I was sleeping over at his house. So I finally managed to see GHOSTBUSTERS for the very first time----and I went Huh?I just sat there with the most puzzled feeling and going, This is it??I just don't know how to describe it. By the time I had finally gotten to see it, I was all prepared for that really cool, hilarious movie everyone was telling me about... and I didn't get one. Instead, I sat through it bored and bewildered. I don't know, somehow I had just expected it to be... very, different. I don't know how, just different, not like the movie I ended up seeing.I really, really, REALLY wanted to like this movie. I truly did. God knows I tried. I bought the soundtrack and everything afterward, trying to get myself to be as nuts about this movie as everybody else I knew was. But I just couldn't get into it at all.A few months later my older brother rented GHOSTBUSTERS and my whole family sat and watched. I, along with my parents, just sat there confused. But my older brother, on the other hand... well, to give you an idea, during the one scene when you briefly see a Ghostbuster hopping along on one foot with his eyes closed, my brother was just rolling all over the floor and squealing with delight. Isn't that just THE most HILARIOUS thing you ever SAW????? he shrieked. The rest of us just sat there trying to figure out what all the fuss was about.It wasn't until years later that I think I finally managed to figure out my huge disappointment with this film. I was not familiar with Hollywood names save for one or two, and I had always just taken movies at face value. It wasn't until much later that I had begun to be familiar with that one particular Ghostbuster who had been doing the foot-hopping that my brother was crowing about, an actor named Bill Murray. This was the first movie is he I had ever seen.I hate to say this, but around 1992 or so after seeing many more of his output, I have come to the conclusion that I simply do not care for Bill Murray. I have never found him funny, on the contrary he bores me to pieces. In the future, I would end up just not enjoying a single, solitary motion picture of his--Bill Murray is apparently just not my type of performer. Only the spectacular LOST IN TRANSLATION ended up winning a huge place in my heart, not because I thought him funny but because I thought his character was genuinely touching and sublimely acted--and that was twenty years after the fact.I find it interesting that, later on, I found the first season of the cartoon based on this film (THE REAL GHOSTBUSTERS, so named as to distinguish it from another Ghostbusters-entitled cartoon released at the same time by Filmation) much more involving and entertaining than the actual movie itself.These days, I can watch it on occasion, but I just watch it on a whim whenever it happens to be on. I haven't actually gone out and rented it myself to this day. My personal feelings are that I probably needed to see it as soon as it was released along with everyone else as opposed to after the rest of the world and putting up with all the hype--I think in my case my expectations ended up being raised so high that I ended up suffering Phantom Menace syndrome for this title. That's a shame, too, as I thought this should be a movie I would automatically love. I have the feeling not getting to see it fresh simply killed it for me and I just didn't get it because I didn't get to experience it along with everyone else properly.

But my older brother, on the other hand... well, to give you an idea, during the one scene when you briefly see a Ghostbuster hopping along on one foot with his eyes closed, my brother was just rolling all over the floor and squealing with delight. Isn't that just THE most HILARIOUS thing you ever SAW????? he shrieked. The rest of us just sat there trying to figure out what all the fuss was about.It wasn't until years later that I think I finally managed to figure out my huge disappointment with this film. I was not familiar with Hollywood names save for one or two, and I had always just taken movies at face value. It wasn't until much later that I had begun to be familiar with that one particular Ghostbuster who had been doing the foot-hopping that my brother was crowing about, an actor named Bill Murray. This was the first movie is he I had ever seen.I hate to say this, but around 1992 or so after seeing many more of his output, I have come to the conclusion that I simply do not care for Bill Murray. I have never found him funny, on the contrary he bores me to pieces. In the future, I would end up just not enjoying a single, solitary motion picture of his--Bill Murray is apparently just not my type of performer. Only the spectacular LOST IN TRANSLATION ended up winning a huge place in my heart, not because I thought him funny but because I thought his character was genuinely touching and sublimely acted--and that was twenty years after the fact.I find it interesting that, later on, I found the first season of the cartoon based on this film (THE REAL GHOSTBUSTERS, so named as to distinguish it from another Ghostbusters-entitled cartoon released at the same time by Filmation) much more involving and entertaining than the actual movie itself.These days, I can watch it on occasion, but I just watch it on a whim whenever it happens to be on. I haven't actually gone out and rented it myself to this day. My personal feelings are that I probably needed to see it as soon as it was released along with everyone else as opposed to after the rest of the world and putting up with all the hype--I think in my case my expectations ended up being raised so high that I ended up suffering Phantom Menace syndrome for this title. That's a shame, too, as I thought this should be a movie I would automatically love. I have the feeling not getting to see it fresh simply killed it for me and I just didn't get it because I didn't get to experience it along with everyone else properly. I still sigh in disappointment whenever I watch it, as even now when I see it on I try so hard to like it... I really, really, REALLY want to like this movie as much as everyone else does, but so far I have yet to get above just okay. Maybe someday I'll finally love it as much as everyone else seems to, though.

The plot is pretty good, and less disjointed than that of other Monty Python creations, so if you're looking for a linear time line based film, then this might interest you. The plot does move along a little slowly, though, even for a Monty Python film(slower than Life of Brian, for example), and the film suffers a little under that. The jokes and sight gags make up for it, but it still does seem a little slow, especially on repeated viewings. The acting is good, as it typically is with Monty Python films. I can't really comment on the characters, but I guess they pretty much stay in character all through the film. The humor is good, but not as great as it is in Life of Brian, though that may be because I've seen it too many times. I don't know, I just wasn't really laughing at any point when I saw this. I knew that it was funny, and a few of the gags do stick in my mind as amusing, but when watching it I couldn't even muster up a slight chuckle. In fact, about an hour into the film, I was getting tired with the film, and hoped that it would end soon. I don't dislike the film, nor do I have anything against the humor, I just think I've grown tired with it. When it's not new and in-your-face anymore, it just loses impact, I guess. The film has plenty of entertaining sequences, and the gags and jokes are mostly quite good. It even has a few very memorable scenes, such as the the Black Knight scene, and the witch scene. The dialog is as sharp as the Python's dialog usually are, and there is more good dialog than there is in Life of Brian. All in all, a good Monty Python film, but just slightly inferior to Life of Brian. I recommend it to any fan of Monty Python, and fans of dark and silly humor in general. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"31 July 2004","score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  This Monty Python film is great, partly because it works on several levels; it works as a straight up typical Monty Python movie(which in itself ensures hilarity) and as a spoof of many of the old medieval times based films.

I am not a big fan of Mel Gibson, I thought that he is just average but too overrated actor. So you can understand why I didn't expect too much from this movie. But now, I want to apologize to Mr. Gibson. In this overlooked masterpiece he proves himself incredibly good both as an actor also as a director. The story was absolutely great, realistic and touching. Relations between two main characters &#150; former teacher and young student boy (perfectly played by Mel Gibson and Nick Stahl) were shown as great as it possible. It was for sure best Mel Gibson performance ever. Young Nick Stahl acting also looked incredibly good as Chuck Norstadt. All supporting casts also did a very good job in their roles Director and whole cast team brought to us incredibly powerful atmosphere of total misunderstanding in Chuck family and in the whole town. People can't understand and worst of all they don't want to understand other people, who are not like all ordinary people in their small town. If you're not like all &#150; you're odd and nothing more. This movie teach us never judge people only by appearance and groundless suspicions, teach us always look inside the people. It was very strong, powerful and important messages. All dialogs were very well written and very memorable. In addition to this cinematography and soundtrack were very good.So, I consider The Man Without a Face as a stunning excellent film, best Mel Gibson film, one the best of the year and one of the best movies I've ever seen.

This is what defeats it, coupled with the fact that it definitely won't meet everyone's expectations nor will it fit everyone's taste. It's dark and moody, and has a great deal of atmosphere, and this is what makes the film enjoyable. It also does present a somewhat realistic hero, by giving him a gigantic network of agents operating all around the world, the ability to use telepathy to hide his existence and his true identity, and his invisibility. I found him to be a fairly interesting and exciting hero, but I know that not all will. I can imagine many also will be unhappy with the fact that the film takes place in a time far from our own, and in the past rather than the future. It takes place in and around the 1930's, and it does present a pretty believable vision of that time. The plot is good, not to say great, and moves along at a good pace. It's not too fast, but not too slow, either. The acting ranges, but it's mostly good, if not great. I found most of the main characters to be quite well-acted and credible. Alec Baldwin, John Lone, Penelope Ann Miller, Peter Boyle, Ian McKellen and Tim Curry... all did pretty good jobs. I have to say, Baldwin and Curry gave the best performances, in my opinion. The characters are well-written and credible; I especially liked Shiwan Khan, who was without a doubt a very worthy adversary of The Shadow. The special effects(especially the CGI) is not very impressive by todays standards, but it looks good enough, and it does the job it's supposed to. The action sequences were fairly good, though of course it can't compare to the standard of comic book movies of today. The problem with this movie, apart from everything I've already stated, is that it feels a little too Hollywood; the sub-plot about the love interest, the climax, some of the dialog... it's good, you know, but it just feels a little too mainstream to be great. All in all, a great movie, about a somewhat believable hero. Too bad a sequel probably won't happen, as this did have potential to be a great franchise. I recommend it to fans of comic book movies, and possibly fans of the other The Shadow material(the magazine, the TV series, the movie from '37, and possibly even the radio shows).

Be sure that if this film was made by another director then the emotional barrier would not have been in sight. Instead of this film being a shoot- em- up we actually find a story of love and pain. Besson has a certain way of directing if you have seen his previous 'Nikita' and picturesque 'The Big Blue', he has the ability to bring more depth into an average film. Leon is played by the entertaining Jean Reno (Godzilla, Ronin) and he perfects the role of a lone Italian hit-man lost on the streets of New York. Gary Oldman is quite superb as the psychotic cop and is pivotal in raising the tempo of the film. Oldman is truly brilliant and would steal the honours if it wasn't for a young Natalie Portman. Just as Jodie Foster made her breakthrough in Taxi Driver Portman conducts herself wonderfully as a youthful daughter of a drug seller seemingly unloved by her family. The only love was for her unfortunate younger brother whom is unintentionally shot dead by Oldman's henchmen. This I must say was prominent in showing the way love is torn away and then found again; Mathilda (Portman) finds a father figure in Leon whom at first is reluctant to accept her-a hindras to his identity. From her though they both gradually form a strong bond that is not stepping over the line, it is simply a love almost unconditional as referring to Leon taking the place of her father. The film itself is shot to perfection, violence is kept relatively low though still keeping the tempo and pace flowing.

Be sure that if this film was made by another director then the emotional barrier would not have been in sight. Instead of this film being a shoot- em- up we actually find a story of love and pain. Besson has a certain way of directing if you have seen his previous 'Nikita' and picturesque 'The Big Blue', he has the ability to bring more depth into an average film. Leon is played by the entertaining Jean Reno (Godzilla, Ronin) and he perfects the role of a lone Italian hit-man lost on the streets of New York. Gary Oldman is quite superb as the psychotic cop and is pivotal in raising the tempo of the film. Oldman is truly brilliant and would steal the honours if it wasn't for a young Natalie Portman. Just as Jodie Foster made her breakthrough in Taxi Driver Portman conducts herself wonderfully as a youthful daughter of a drug seller seemingly unloved by her family. The only love was for her unfortunate younger brother whom is unintentionally shot dead by Oldman's henchmen. This I must say was prominent in showing the way love is torn away and then found again; Mathilda (Portman) finds a father figure in Leon whom at first is reluctant to accept her-a hindras to his identity. From her though they both gradually form a strong bond that is not stepping over the line, it is simply a love almost unconditional as referring to Leon taking the place of her father. The film itself is shot to perfection, violence is kept relatively low though still keeping the tempo and pace flowing. This action film soon succumbs the viewer into actually admiring and appreciating leons work; no women no children is a philosophy that Leons boss must keep to. And not only this Leon is always assigned to deal with criminals, which in return isn't too bad. The reason this film is so good is for the fact that you really feel sorry for Leon and the finale just enhances that sorrow.In all this film is a must see not only for it's slick storyline and entertaining acting. A must see.  ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"31 July 2004","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  I really enjoyed this movie. It took a common subject (espionage) and put a twist on it. I didn't think that I'd be a Matt Damon fan, but was for this movie. I look forward to seeing the next installment. I didn't feel that there were any slow moments in the story line. Some of the action did seem a little predicable. I haven't read the books, so I can't say how close they are to the story line. I do think that this series is capable of producing more than one sequel and I hope that it is done in a professional, non dragging manner. I encourage you to see the movie and hope that it is a positive experience for you too. I know that I will keep watching.

If one is interested in Romance, the leads are VERY attractive people. They do not start out hating each other as many romances do. They begin by an immediate recognition of the worth and value of the other. Each has gone through something that makes that value apparent to the other, although we really focus on Andrew Shepard (Douglas). He is charming. He has just enough little boy in him to be very appealing;the wife of the best man at Shepherd's first wedding explains to Sydney that men like to be insulted by women. She says that with great affection and we know that in Shepard's case, it's true. Sydney's instincts, fortified in part by that comment, defers to his office, but she is not intimidated by the man himself. And he knows that. He likes her all the more for her graceful balance.But it was the politics that we find interesting, or I did. There was a time in American history when politicians were idealists. One cannot read about John Quincy Adams without some admiration for the American system.Here was a man that served the United States for almost his entire life. He was an ambassador and most remarkably, he was a Member of Congress after his presidency. He believed very strongly that the constitution should be tested over every issue and put forth legislation that branded him as an abolitionist in the worst sense of the word -- uttered by people who made it sound like it had only 4 letters. He was one of those who defended the rights of other to speak those things which he himself would spend his life speaking against. But he felt that Congress should debate everything of political relevance. JQA took very little for his public service. He was always trying to find money for just his basic needs. Compare that to modern politicians.The last speech Douglas gives and the one Rothschild gives before are classic yearnings for what was a more idealist time that once existed in the past. It always brings tears to my eyes because I admire America immensely and wish there were men like Andrew Shepherd in public life. The Federalist papers could never be written by Bush and Bush as they were by Adams and Adams. I would so like to see men of ideals governing us. Not to be.But that does not stop me from wanting it.See the movie. Listen to the speeches. Learn about what America was like at her best and hope that we could have her be that way again.5 out of 5 ","genre":null},{"date":"31 July 2004","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" So you don't think this movie really depicts the way politics are.And you don't believe a president can become involved with a lobbyist.It's tinsel.

My main reason for liking Casablanca over To Have... is that, in Casablanca, Bogart is a defeated man, a man running away from himself, a man who would put his neck out for nobody (mainly because he's too scared to be hurt again; or in other words, his past experiences have left him synical.)...but yet he has full control over his faculties...to such an extent that when circumstances put everything at his feet, he can see through it and can decide that the victory that is waiting there to garland him won't be his triumph, but rather another, a greater defeat.
