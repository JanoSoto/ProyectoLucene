By the time Willow was released, audiences at the time were well-acquainted (perhaps even a little overly familiar) with sword-and-sorcery movies.Recently I rented this movie through Netflix because I could not remember if I had ever seen it. After watching it, I have to be honest and admit that I am not sure that I ever saw it before, even as a child.I only remembered it at all because I believe in my childhood I had a Willow action figure, the evil queen's guard, if I remember correctly. I lost the toy a long time ago, but I figured I might as well watch the movie.If I had seen this movie as a child, I might perhaps have liked it better than I do as an adult. Watching it as an adult, what struck me most about the movie is that it is a surprisingly big production for a 1988 fantasy movie.Audiences today, accustomed to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy and other epic-scale fantasies with computer-generated effects, might not be impressed by Willow. But I am old enough to remember the 1980s, and I can safely say that this movie has everything that money could buy in 1988.Since George Lucas produced this movie, the scale of the production should perhaps not be a surprise. He also had the advantage of producing this movie after several years of sword-and-sorcery movies, which enabled him to see what other filmmakers had done and make a bigger, more elaborate fantasy than any of the previous ones.Bigger, however, does not necessarily mean better. Ironically, the main flaw with Willow, in my opinion, is that it has too much of everything lots of chases, lots of monsters, lots of special effects, lots of sword-fights, as though George Lucas wanted to wear out the audience.It almost seems pointless to discuss performances in a movie like this, which depends so much upon special effects. But as far as acting goes, my favorite performance in the movie was by Val Kilmer, as the rogue who helps Willow on his quest. He even survives the indignity of having to dress in drag for an extended sequence. It is easy to see why he went on to other things.Warwick Davis, as Willow, grew on me as the movie progressed. My only objection is that, at times, it is difficult to watch a little person in so many dangerous situations, and being insulted by almost everyone he encounters (obviously that is the movie's point, that Willow perseveres despite the prejudice against him, but it is still hard to watch at times).Fantasy movies are not noted for their terrific screenplays, and Willow unfortunately is not an exception. As I watched it, I could not help by notice where all the ideas were coming from&#x97;the Book of Exodus, Gulliver's Travels, the Lord of the Rings, The Wizard of Oz, etc. Since it lacks the literary origins of most of the best movie fantasies like Lord of the Rings, I also cannot think of any memorable lines from Willow.I do not watch fantasy movies for their acting and writing, however. What interests me most about fantasy movies are their production design, and their visual ideas.For example, I liked the sequence in which Willow and Kilmer escaped from the enemy camp by using a shield as a sled. It reminded me of a similar escape sequence in The Living Daylights (1987). I also liked the scene in which a troll, after being struck by Willow's magic wand, fell into a castle moat and emerged as a two-headed fire-breathing dragon. And I liked some of the unique design ideas, such as the wolves that are made up to look like giant rats.James Horner's musical score is beautiful and suits the movie perfectly. I also have to commend Ron Howard's direction, as he finds just the right tone for this material. Back when this movie was released film critic Leonard Maltin wrote that it was too intense for its target audience of children, but at least it is not overly condescending and juvenile like so many fantasy movies of the 1980s.For all of its fine ingredients, however, after watching Willow it is easy to see why movie audiences in the late 1980s were willing to forget about fantasy movies for a while. Audience tastes were changing, and in any case nothing more could be achieved with the special effects available at that time.While it would be incorrect to say that no fantasy movies were produced between Willow in 1988 and the first Lord of the Rings movie in 2001 (Dragonheart, released in 1996, comes to mind) I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that this movie marks the end of an era.When the first Lord of the Rings movie was released in 2001, it not only added computer-generated effects but was more adult in tone than any of the fantasy movies of decades past. The era of Willow, with its old-fashioned special effects and relatively simple storyline, is genuinely gone.

In a way it is like Buried in that the style of the movie and the ideas that it portrays are brilliant but it can also be so disturbing that you can really only watch it once. Mind you, I have seen this film three times now, and also own the DVD, but after watching it this third time I thought to myself that maybe I really cannot consider watching it again. Also, this film has spawned two sequels, though I am doubtful that the sequels will be anywhere near as good as the original, and the fact that Cube Zero actually answers a lot of the questions that the first film raises sort of destroys the mystery that the original movie creates.Basically a group of people wake up in a cuboid room in a massive maze which is made up of other rooms, some of them trapped, others of them not. While questions are raise as to who made this thing and why they were placed there, these questions turn out to be meaningless simply because there is only one purpose here and that is to escape. I guess that is one of the ideas that comes out of this movie and that is that to many of us the philosophical questions really do not provide us with any real answers as we struggle to survive. In fact, one will note that those who tend to dwell on the philosophical questions are those that are financially free to enable them to pursue these goals. Many of the writers and philosophers in the past all came from rich and affluent societies, and even today the bulk of the working class simply do not care about the answer to 'why' but are only interested in their next paycheque.Then there is the idea of the prison. One thing that I discovered is that each of the characters are named after a famous prison (though only San Quentin and Leavenworth ring a bell to me). While the Cube is in itself a prison, the idea of the prison is not necessarily always physical, and some cases can be social and even mental. Kazan for instance is imprisoned by his autism, however it is interesting that he is the only one who manages to escape, possibly because it is his autism that actually makes him free.

I didn't hate it, I didn't love it, and certainly after following The Voyage Home, Final Frontier felt like a massive step backwards.The whole God notion didn't really interest me much then, it seemed such a silly premise, that later we discover in the movie its not God at all is beside the point, many people were turned off from seeing the movie in the first place, because whilst many people believe in God, they probably never actually want to see God, and certainly not a silly sci- fi movies interpretation of God either.Sybok as the main villain...... turns out he's not really a villain at all, but I felt the whole 'Sybok is Spocks brother' storyline was a bit too much soap opera for me. There was never any allusion to Spock having a brother, and for it to be brought up after all this time, just felt too tacked on.Other characters were shortchanged and had virtually no character development, especially the three that were trapped on Nimbus, held captive by Sybok.The one saving grace for the entire movie though, was the camaraderie of the three main characters. I didn't really appreciate it first time around, but more so now, I found myself laughing and smiling, the interaction of Kirk, Spock and Bones at various parts really helped lift the movie, and its one of the few things that helped prevent the movie being drab and boring.The VFX are long held up as being not the best, but to be honest, with the exception of the horrible matte lines around the Enterprise when it was in front of the blue clouds of Shakaree, for the most part, I didn't really notice any problems.

As I said though, it is not a serious movie, which means that we have to suspend or disbelief quite a lot (particularly since they seem to escape from gaol a little too easily, drop such distances that would normally result in broken legs, as well as driving an RV with a mini-gun mounted to the side through the streets of Los Angeles).Basically Tango is a millionaire who dresses like one and is a cop simply for the action. Cash is the opposite, a lot more crude, a lot more rough, and a lot poorer (due to his $9.00 shirt that lands up with a hole in it).

That's not to say that it's a bad movie, it's far from it. There are so many fantastic pieces to this film, rounding off nearly everything which has been brought up previously. It's okay that it doesn't work as well as the other two parts because it's the last part of a big trilogy. When you're closing off so many plot strands, it's difficult to make everything run smoothly, and I think this film attempts it valiantly.I love the opening scenes with Jabba the Hutt. He's probably one of the most disgusting-looking creatures in any movie I've seen before. The 'flawless' plan of Luke and Leia is great, and you're convinced that it's worked until it cuts to Jabba and his minions watching Leia and Han. The plan that they do successfully execute before Han and Luke are given to the Sarlacc (the addition to which I hated in the 'Special Edition') is exciting and has one of the better fight scenes of the trilogy. Yoda's death is another great scene, as he became so beloved in the previous films. However, it does lead onto the most ludicrous plot twist of the trilogy. Luke and Leia are siblings. It's a stupid twist which I disliked thoroughly, since it felt very contrived and like it had been made up gratuitously between Episodes V and VI. What makes it obviously worse is that the pair share a kiss earlier on in the trilogy, which George Lucas certainly wouldn't have done if he'd decided beforehand that they were related.I also thought that most of the second half was slightly drawn out, and occasionally it dragged too much. Also, the Ewoks are ridiculously creepy, but their chase scene is well paced. My favourite part of the film was the ending, because of the final twist which for me was completely unexpected. The fact that Vader, who is seen beforehand as the epitome of evil, manages to change his ways so that he can save his son is touching and does feel very surprising. Their final scene together, and the appearance of 'Prequel Trilogy' Anakin at the very end, does confirm that he does have some good in him, and that no character is pure evil. It manages to add depth to Vader, which helps this film out greatly.As a trilogy closer, this is one of the better ones out there, but as a standalone, I do think that it is slightly too long and dragged out. But maybe that's just because I started watching it for the first time at midnight. Who knows.

What makes it obviously worse is that the pair share a kiss earlier on in the trilogy, which George Lucas certainly wouldn't have done if he'd decided beforehand that they were related.I also thought that most of the second half was slightly drawn out, and occasionally it dragged too much. Also, the Ewoks are ridiculously creepy, but their chase scene is well paced. My favourite part of the film was the ending, because of the final twist which for me was completely unexpected. The fact that Vader, who is seen beforehand as the epitome of evil, manages to change his ways so that he can save his son is touching and does feel very surprising. Their final scene together, and the appearance of 'Prequel Trilogy' Anakin at the very end, does confirm that he does have some good in him, and that no character is pure evil. It manages to add depth to Vader, which helps this film out greatly.As a trilogy closer, this is one of the better ones out there, but as a standalone, I do think that it is slightly too long and dragged out.

That's not to say that it's a bad movie, it's far from it. There are so many fantastic pieces to this film, rounding off nearly everything which has been brought up previously. It's okay that it doesn't work as well as the other two parts because it's the last part of a big trilogy. When you're closing off so many plot strands, it's difficult to make everything run smoothly, and I think this film attempts it valiantly.I love the opening scenes with Jabba the Hutt. He's probably one of the most disgusting-looking creatures in any movie I've seen before. The 'flawless' plan of Luke and Leia is great, and you're convinced that it's worked until it cuts to Jabba and his minions watching Leia and Han. The plan that they do successfully execute before Han and Luke are given to the Sarlacc (the addition to which I hated in the 'Special Edition') is exciting and has one of the better fight scenes of the trilogy.

It is a movie of stunning lines and real characters. It is a movie of many themes all tied together and one that has gone down in history as a classic. It is a movie that needs to be watched over again to fully understand many of the ideas that flow through it. Lawrence of Arabia is nothing short of brilliant.The movie is set in the closing stages of World War I where the British want to encourage the Arabs to revolt against the Ottoman Empire and destroy a thousand year regime. The period is constantly referred to in the movie as the Arab rising, and it is a rising for independence, not for overthrowing the Ottoman Empire. Lawrence is sent to Arabia to liaise with the Arabs and try to unite them and send them against the Turks. He sees the opportunity to capture the port of Aqaba so that the British can land and attack the Turks from behind. Thus Lawrence sets out to capture the city and crosses what is considered to be one of the harshest sections of Arabia.Lawrence is a messiah figure. He believes himself to be as such for he compares himself to Moses. After capturing Aqaba he decides that he needs to inform the British and proposes to cross the Sinai desert. His Arab colleagues believe that he cannot do it, but he believes that he can. He crossed the desert to take Aqaba and they said he could not do it, but he did. As the movie progresses we see that the Arab tribes flock to him and he becomes more of an authority figure. Even more he believes that he can reshape the Arab nation and rushes to Damascus to capture it under the name of the Arabs, but this idea will be examined later.Lawrence is a very complex character. He is an Englishman that falls in love with the desert. He comes to believe that he is apart of the desert and dresses as those of the desert. At first it seems that he is doing it to take the role of a leader, and his Arab friend believes that when he returns to his English people he will return to their ways, but he does not. Instead he has become an Arab in his heart. He walks into the bar dressed as an Arab with an Arab and receives a very cold welcome. He is slowly changing. He stands out among the ordered uniformed officers. Lawrence refuses to become like the rest and retains his Arab feelings. As the movie progresses we see that he slowly moves from somebody who feels that killing is wrong to become a blood thirsty savage. Before Cairo he watches two people die, and by the end he screams take no prisoners and massacres an almost defenseless Turkish army. After the massacre he carries a bloodied knife with blood covering his hands. Lawrence degenerates into a savage and the movie ends with him returning to England silent.On the other hand Lawrence's companion moves the other way. He begins as a savage Arab who hates certain tribes because they are his enemy. He first walks onto the scene after shooting Lawrence's friend because he stole water from his well. The more he follows Lawrence, the more he becomes indentured into civilised English life. The final part has the Arabs realising that Lawrence is a double edged sword that is no good for anything. A psychopath makes a brilliant general but a hopeless leader. We see this in history with Ulysses S. Grant, and in the movie with Lawrence as he fails to establish an Arab democracy in Damascus.Modernisation and the descent into barbarity are the major themes in the movie. The Arabs are shown as a primitive people who do not understand technology. They begin by fleeing from Turkish planes that attack one of their encampments. They don't want technology but they cannot escape it. With Lawrence's leadership they begin to embrace it even though they do not understand it. They are given too much at once, as can be seen at the failure of ruling Damascus. They cannot use the electricity and the people in the hospital are dying because they are incapable of improper care. It is this scene in the hospital that makes Lawrence realise that he cannot rule a nation.On the otherhand there is the descent into barbarity. Who are the real savages? Lawrance becomes one and the Turks are seen as such, but Lawrence's friend is appalled that Lawrence brutally massacred an army of Turks. The British considered the Arabs to be barbaric but we see by the British attitude that they were barbaric. They were not fighting the Turks to free the Arabs but to change the control of the region. The British divided the region into both French and British sectors, the Arabs had no say in the decision. What we see is the collapse of the old order in the emergence of the new. The Ottoman Empire is disintegrating as the British and French move in to reshape the area. Lawrence made an impact, but once it was made, he is quietly taken away.

Laurie Strode is nowhere to be found in this one. Michael instead sets his sights on murdering his 9-year old niece, Laurie's daughter Jamie. Back story to this one tells us that Laurie died in a car accident a while back, therefore her daughter was adopted by the Lloyd family. Michael Myers meanwhile has been locked away in a state facility, recovering from his burns following the hospital explosion in 'Halloween II'. It's the night before Halloween 1988 when a practically comatose Michael is being transferred to another clinic. He of course escapes and that's when his reign of terror begins yet again. Michael makes his way to Haddonfield, and Dr. Loomis is hot on his trail. He knows that Michael will be targeting his niece Jamie, so most of 'Halloween 4' is spent with Michael stalking Jamie and her adoptive big sister Rachel as the two are out trick-or-treating. Michael slashes his way through many people in order to get to innocent little Jamie, all leading up to a pretty shocking conclusion.I like 'Halloween 4' a lot. Not only does it bring Michael Myers back into the series, but it does well at creating the creepy atmosphere that was accomplished in the first two films. Haddonfield is still a dark little town on Halloween, it has a good resemblance of the streets in the 1978 film. The acting was done VERY well in this fourth instalment, especially from child actor Danielle Harris. She puts in a very believable performance as the tormented and terrified Jamie Lloyd. Ellie Cornell, as protective big sister Rachel, did a great job as well. The two had a great chemistry as the adoptive siblings.A flaw with 'Halloween 4' is that having a little child as Michael's target is not nearly as effective as it was having teenage Laurie Strode in the first two films. It just works better with an older person in the lead, and that's not a knock on Danielle Harris.

Romero George Romero's Night Of The Living Dead marked the implosion of the white, middle class, American nuclear family and portrayed the collapse of post-war patriarchal authority into a kind of mad hysteria. What followed - the sexual, political and social revolutions of the 1960s - were not so much rebellions against tyrannical paternal and political despots, or against the rigid repressions of suburban family life, as they were carnivalesque revelations that the emperor had no clothes. That 1950s suburbia offered nothing but hypocrisy and fake decor. As such, Romero has his nuclear family holed up in a farmhouse - the impotence of the father mirroring the clownishness and impotence of various authority figures on his television screen - until the unit collapses under the weight of its own stupidity and children-turned-zombies avidly consume their own parents. As is always the case with Romero, the zombies are actually the good guys, the new zombie order literally consuming the outmoded old. The zombie horde then become a darkly humorous vision of hippie communalism who are the preferred refuge of the children of the white middle class.But the rebellions of the 1960s went nowhere, hope fading and forgotten. Hippies and campus radicals from middle-class backgrounds grew up to be yuppies, and their influence on the larger culture was mostly a matter of an easily saleable lifestyle. Once the social upheavals of the 60s had passed, consumerism turned out to be the real winner, so it's entirely appropriate that Romero's second zombie movie, Dawn of the Dead, takes place in a shopping mall. Here our heroes live a fantasy of commodity abundance and unhinged consumption, whilst the zombies draw inexorably closer, the mall reminding them of their happiest pre-death moments. In this world there is no satisfaction, only lack, the zombie's unquenchable lust for flesh mocking the consumer's unquenchable desires.Then came Day of the Dead, arguably the best film in the series. Here, 60s radicalism and 70s consumerism are shunted aside in favour for an assault on Reaganism and the military\/scientific complex, where pathologically macho soldiers try to keep the zombies at bay whilst scientists try with futility to either destroy the zombie plague or tame the zombies. The film is relentless in its deconstruction of military authoritarianism and scientific claims to supreme authority, but mostly it's the film's treatment of Freud's reality\/pleasure principle and its thick fatalism which makes it so unique. Here, the zombies embody a kind of sympathetic, undeveloped and (pre-language, pre-entry-into-the-Symbolic) ego-less desire (they do not know why they want\/desire), which contrasts with the libidinal economy and the twisted viciousness of the human characters (who bury the true motivations of their desires and hypocritically stand for social order).Each of Romero's zombie movies were intended to be a snapshot of the decade in which they was released; Night the 60s, Dawn the 70s and Day the 80s. Land of the Dead, for financial reasons, was released in the 21st century, but it is actually a broad critique of 90s American society. Here, social class and warfare comes to the foreground, the film imagining America as a paranoid bastion of humanity and freedom, standing tall against the foreign horde. In Land of the Dead, the ruling class live lives of elegance and supreme wealth in the exclusive and gated high-rises of Fiddler's Green, while the masses outside do their dirty bidding and scrape by on low incomes, distracting themselves from their worries with sex, drugs, gambling and violence. The leader of this late-capitalist America, a George Bush styled madman out to make the rich richer and who refuses to negotiate with terrorists, subsists by sending into zombie territory teams of mercenaries who steal zombie loot (he achieves this by distracting the zombies with fireworks- a kind of metaphor for media spectacle and social brainwashing). The zombies themselves are, once again, the good guys, often linked with the rebelling humans who wish to rise up against their overlords. When the zombies break into the city - led by a black zombie of course - it's symbolic of the proletariat finally rising against their masters and demanding restitution and justice, though Romero knows this is but a futile, 1960s pipe dream. He ends the film with the zombies defeated, the humans infected, and the rebels disillusioned, the masses going their separate ways at the end of the film, wandering off into the horizon like so many disillusioned cinematic anti-heroes of cinema's golden age, specifically the existential road movies of the early 1970s.8.5\/10 &#x96; Day of the Dead8\/10 &#x96; Land of the Dead, Dawn of the Dead7.5\/10 &#x96; Night of the Living Dead Despite their tiny budgets and at times poor acting, these films still operate fairly well as popcorn movies.

Fierstein only longs for a husband and child, and when he meets the bi-sexual Ed (Brian Kerwin), it all seems possible. But Ed is confused, goes off to marry an ex-girlfriend, and Arnold finally finds happiness with the handsome Alan (Matthew Broderick), a model whom Arnold at first can't believe would give him the time of day. Finally, there's Arnold's mom (Anne Bancroft), a hard-nosed stereotypical Jewish mother who refuses to accept Arnold's homosexuality, especially when he adopts a gay teenager (Eddie Castrodad) whom she initially suspects is a mugger.Along the way, there is lots of comedy, some true-to-life tragedy (involving a very violent gay bashing), and finally, a confrontation between mother and son that makes Arnold want to find his own lamppost, a la Fanny Brice, and sing another torch song to reveal his own inner torment. This makes for a very enjoyable film that many gays and lesbians can identify with in their desire to find a partner and gain acceptance from a parent. Broadway actor Ken Page (Guys and Dolls, Ain't Misbehavin'), Axel Vera and drag legend Charles Pierce appear as Arnold's co-stars in the drag revue, all featuring funny drag names. There's also a bit of sexual action which takes Arnold inside the back room of a gay bar where obvious fornicating is taking place, another variation of the torch song which reveals how sometimes gay men use sex to deal with their tragedies. (At least I won't have to make them breakfast, Arnold snidely tells someone he earlier cursed at before making his way into the back room.) Throughout the entire film, you really feel the weight of Arnold's world, his very untypical hero very much worth rooting for as he deals with the loss of lovers (through break-up and death), the anger of a parent, and finally, being frustrated himself as a parent. Bancroft is extremely intense in her handful of scenes as the frustrated mother, tired of her son throwing his homosexuality in her face, and even more angry when he shows what she considers disrespect at the family grave site. She's not the type of mother you want to see showing up unannounced, yet there's a sense that, like Neil Simon's grandmother character in Lost in Yonkers, there's a ton of regret that her emotions can't handle and has been replaced by an over-load of bitterness that cannot be diminished. As directed by Paul Bogart (best known for TV's All in the Family), Torch Song Trilogy is one of those small emotional dramas that will touch your heart and leave you thinking long after the movie is over.
