I suppose part of the explanation behind why this movie is, well, the way it is, is it's simultaneously attempting to reacquaint old viewers with the core people and their relationships, and introduce it to new-comers. A good deal of this consists of establishing, and as a direct result, the characters don't have a lot to do, nor is the overall story given as much screen-time and attention as it could, considering that this is the longest of these. The plot isn't entirely original, if the resolution is satisfying. The moral is also retread ground. This isn't particularly action-based, but, rather, something to think about. That may have been to further distinguish it from Star Wars. This does, however, come off as relatively Hollywoodized, maybe especially when compared to the show itself. All of this isn't to say that this is poor... it certainly has its worth. There is genuine drama and tension herein. It feels like a film, grand and epic, with a masterful score, fantastic(although probably improved in the newer releases) special effects, and a budget that allowed it to achieve a greater scope. The pacing is uneven throughout. The language is gratuitous, albeit not harsh. This contains more of such than the entire television series put together. This isn't as fine for children to watch as earlier efforts in the franchise, though aforementioned(be aware that there are a few disturbing details) is the only thing that isn't handled in a tasteful manner. And there is a reason this has been referred to as The Motion Sickness. The acting is solid, and this in general has next to no silly or goofy moments, but works as a serious piece(just don't take *all* of the science as fact). Thankfully everyone remembered how to portray their roles, and the writing is credible as well. This should be seen as a starting point, from where the later entries would spring forth. The 2-Disc DVD set holds a commentary track, several deleted\/additional scenes(of varying quality), a bit of promotional material including trailers and TV spots and a couple of featurettes\/documentaries(one on the making and another on the recent retouching, both are well-done) many of which are interesting and worth the time. I recommend this to Trekkies as well as those who have never seen any Star Trek, and fans of sci-fi that holds food for thought.

Contrary to popular belief, it did not bomb, but it is just not as endearing as the first two. Richard Pryor plays Gus Gorman, a computer hacker who ends up working for the millionaire Ross Webster (Robert Vaughn). Webster is really just a third rate Lex Luthor. It's sad that they had to copy Luthor in the only Superman film that he does not appear in! Gorman and Webster come up with some plan to control the weather with computers, and to get Superman out of the way, Gorman invents synthetic Kryptonite.In the mean time, Clark Kent goes back to Smallville for his High School Reunion, and reunites with his old girlfriend Lana Lang, who is now a single mother. Their romance is not as exciting as the Clark-Lois-Superman love triangle in the first two films, but it does present us with a Clark Kent that is more down to earth and less of a disguise. Unfortunately Gorman ruins everything for Superman when he presents the fake Kryptonite to him as a gift. The Kryptonite has an unexpected effect on Superman- it turns him evil, and he wreaks havoc all over the world.The most common criticism of Superman III is that it is not really a Superman movie, but a Richard Pryor film with Superman in it. I think this is definitely true. Richard Lester went far too overboard on the humor here. It is much more intrusive here than it ever was in the first two films. I think after making two films about one character, it is OK to focus more on a bad guy, but only when the bad guy is a good character. Gorman is some kind of bad sitcom character and feels out of place in a Superman film.What frustrates me the most about this film is the wasted potential. So many of the ideas in the script could have been executed better. The evil Superman story was a great idea, but it does not take up a considerable amount of time. Can you imagine a movie where Superman turns evil, and his human friends try to bring him back? That would have made for some great comic book melodrama! The scene where Superman fights Clark Kent ranks as one of the best moments of the series. It was a good metaphorical way to portray the good side of Clark Kent trying to take over his body again. Unfortunately the bad Superman story is played mostly for laughs, so it does not come close to saving the film.Lois Lane is also sorely missed. It is rumored that Margot Kidder hated the Salkinds so much for firing Richard Donner that she did not cooperate when Richard Lester took over Superman II, so the Salkinds decided to give her a 5 minute cameo in this movie. Her presence could have made the film so much more interesting. Lana Lang loves Clark Kent for who he is, whereas Lois Lane loves Superman. Having to choose between the two women would have been a very interesting dilemma for Superman. Who would he be happier with? It would be like deciding which side of himself is more important to him. They tried to do something like this in Superman IV, but it was played for laughs since Clark was not in love with Mariel Hemingway.While Superman III has good action scenes, the best special effects in the series, and a sincere performance from Christopher Reeve, I cannot recommend this film.

Not because he hits every ball out of the park, because he clearly doesn't; but because he never lets his few strikeouts compel him to try to hit a five-run homer the next time out. In an era marked by increasingly degraded and degrading notions of entertainment and storytelling - for pity's sake, as I write this, grown adults are waxing rhapsodic over a movie about a costumed billionaire-vigilante (!!) - Sayles understands that great drama is about the people we meet every day; the places we live in and how they shape us; the things that change, and the things that remain; and above all, about the human heart in conflict with itself. In LIMBO, he takes risks with his zig-zagging narrative most filmmakers simply aren't capable of, and reaps rewards of such profundity, and richness of feeling, that most audiences are too conditioned by junk-culture to recognize, let alone appreciate them. Some viewers have felt betrayed by LIMBO's seismic shifts in tone and direction, and the elliptical ending, but even that sense of betrayal speaks to how utterly absorbing and moving his handling of his Alaska-set story is, and how unblinking his observations of his characters. (You can only feel betrayed if you're deeply invested in the story that's been presented, after all.) Sayles' screenplay, like his direction, is so completely free of artifice as to seem transparent - his heroes and villains are separated only by their degrees of vulnerability and weakness under pressure - and his small cast of actors are working at the height of their gifts. David Straithairn, always underrated, has never been better, and young Vanessa Martinez is a quiet revelation. You won't forget these characters, or this movie, regardless of how the ending affects you. And though you hate to jinx his thus-far phenomenal career with red-carpet hullabaloo, maybe it's time to make it official and coronate John Sayles as the greatest moviemaker of our time.

And though you hate to jinx his thus-far phenomenal career with red-carpet hullabaloo, maybe it's time to make it official and coronate John Sayles as the greatest moviemaker of our time. He may not need or want the crown, but Hollywood certainly needs to made to cry uncle and acknowledge it.

I remember the intense fan base when the series aired and I've seen a few scenes flipping through the TV stations but that is it. The film makers of the first big screen X Files film stated that they wanted to make a movie for fans of the series, but also a movie that anyone could watch and they succeeded in that task in a big way because I loved the movie!! I mean X Files is enough of a cult iconic series that probably 99% of the world knows the basis of Fox and Mulder and a little about their background which I do so that certainly helps. But even outside of that they spend significant time on character development, a strong story that links the TV Series but also stands perfectly on it's own, and gives us a riveting sci-fi action experience. X-Files creator Chris Carter obviously has a love and a passion for the sci-fi but also for his characters and the cast he chose to play them. Director Rob Bowman has been doing Television, in particular great Television for two decades, and knows how to handle a story and bring it to the big screen which is no small task.David Duchovny has got to be one of the driest actors on the planet. There is very few roles that could suit his style but Agent Fox Mulder is most definitely one of them. As Mulder he makes everything seem possible and plays the lead very well. He makes the film move at a good pace and plays the role of Mulder to perfection. Gillian Anderson is and always has been Ying to Mulder's Yang. Anderson and Dochovny have unmistakable chemistry and yet both of them as actors and their characters seem very dry...perhaps a testament to the writing and creation of Chris Carter because they are superb in their roles and go above and beyond for the film. Martin Landau is terrific as the conspiracy driving force Dr. Kurtzweil. He is really the most prominent supporting actor and everyone else shares little screen time but they all do great and it appears as though some of the staple characters from the series are also there.Of course there is more to bringing a TV Series to film than making it watchable for non-fans but that does give them big points because I loved it without ever having former plots or stories to know about. And yet fans seem to love it too so they succeeded. On it's own merit the story is a terrific thriller with plenty of conspiracy and aliens and Government cover ups and takes you from Dallas to the Arctic in a heart beat and leaves you wanting more!! The film definitely makes me want to see the series and follow up on the characters and that is also a sign of a great film from TV. The special effects are top notch and everyone does a great job and the story is so fluid and riveting. Plenty of memorable moments to say the least. So if you love science fiction, conspiracy, or even have always thought you would like The X Files, do yourself a favor and check this one out because it won't disappoint. A real gem and sure to be a classic for years. 8.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"31 July 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I will tell you right from the start that I have never seen an entire episode of The X Files.

There's also a cast of characters who are more wrapped up in their romantic entanglements than in the body of Harry, who should be the focal point of the story. Matter of fact, one of the greatest delights of The Trouble with Harry is that the so-called MacGuffin this time *is* the dead body, and not some random object. Harry could just as well be anything, but the only thing that is of concern is, of course, that he's dead.What I loved seeing, as almost Hitchcock being a surrealist (he was a big fan of Bunuel after all) as much as being a director of dark\/light comedy, was the non-chalance treated with the body from those around it throughout. The opening scenes had me floored, grinning cheek to cheek and sometimes just chuckling or laughing hysterically, at some line or moment in behavior from Edmund Gwynn and Mildred Natwicks' reactions (or lack thereof) to the dearly departed Harry on the ground. They go on and on talking about meeting later in the day, almost flirting by Gwynn's advances, and there's a DEAD BODY ON THE GROUND! On top of this there's the reactions from a little kid who loves playing with a dead rabbit, Shirley MacClaine as his mother and ex-lover of Harry, and the artist Marlowe played by John Forsythe, who seems to take a detached position almost in spite of making a detailed sketch of the dead Harry's face.So all of this, done in a manner that should suggest reality but doesn't in the slightest, builds up to something that is like the other side of the morbid coin that one saw in Strangers on a Train. Murder is treated a few Hitchcock works almost philosophically, but with with an air of 'oh, it's just a little death, no harm really', and in the Trouble with Harry it's done to the max. A good portion of the movie has nothing to do with Harry, even if he's on the characters' minds; a lot of courtship goes on between the elder Capt. Wiles and Miss Ivy Gravely and (very rushed, which is the point) between Marlowe and Jennifer Rogers. Forsythe might not be the best cast in the part, but everyone else is, and they all bring something to putting whatever potential is in the script to the fullest. Sometimes it doesn't look like it should be funny, but then something else comes along- another strange line of dialog, another aside about Harry's body being moved here or there- that turns things on its head.It's basically Hitchcock having fun with something that, for him, is probably more lighthearted then it might be for most. It's not a totally pitch black comedy, but then again Hithcock is deceptive, devilishly so, in in making things as simple as they seem. As with Bunuel everything seems like it should be straightforward, which adds to the absurdity, until one realizes that it means to be absurd like some yarn that you hear from a fellow you don't totally trust but listen intently anyway. It's not quite one of Hitchcock's masterpieces, but it surely is one of the best among those experiments that the director made from time to time, testing himself and the audience and putting energies into something that could turn his reputation on a turn.

The Caped Crusader created by Bob Kane and whose popularity was resurrected by Tim Burton and later by Christopher Nolan, has had one major and notable setback and this film is that. Batman & Robin is nothing more than an advertisement for toys, even so far as to having one character actually explaining what her action figure will have in the box. This gigantic mess of a production is also responsible in an accomplishment that makes one question whether the word Batman should even be in the title it's boring. If a piece of popcorn entertainment actually manages to make your eyes drowsy, despite the massive amount of colourful imagery on screen, then it is not doing its job. As an action film, Batman & Robin is a massive failure and as a comic book film, it's even worse, insulting the intelligence of the audience in the process.Already off the bat, Mr Freeze (Arnold Schwarzeneggar) is introduced as the main villain in this piece with his plan to steal enough diamonds so as to save his beloved wife, who is suffering from a fatal disease. Down in South America, scientist Pamela Isley (Uma Thurman) discovers that her boss has been using her plant-related research to create massive machine men for ruthless world leaders. In response to Isley threatening to report him to the authorities, he kills her with chemicals. However, instead she turns into the evil Poison Ivy, a plant-obsessed woman bent on a plan of world domination that's not made one-hundred percent. Not that the audience cares at this point, anyway. Meanwhile, it is up to Batman (George Clooney) and Robin (Chris O'Donnell) to save Gotham from being both frozen over and turn into a garden of poisonous flowers. Trusted butler Alfred (Michael Dough) is also dying and his niece (Alicia Silverstone) comes to visit and sure enough becomes Batgirl.As evidenced by the plot summary above, one of the main problems with Batman & Robin storywise is that screenwriter Akiva Goldsman is not able to balance all of those major characters enough to probably develop them. The poorly written script is particularly helped by the horribly cheesy lines that litter the production, especially with Mr Freeze whom every line seems to be a bad pun related to coldness. Goldsman also attempts to have us sympathyse with Freeze in how much he cares for his wife. Unfortunately, what could have been touching actually feels like a weak attempt at making the audience care for such an irritating character. If anybody in Batman & Robin is more annoying than Freeze, than it's the titular sidekick. All of his dialogue mostly consists of moaning about how Bruce Wayne is hogging the spotlight and stopping Robin from trying to get hold of the villains. The fact that the usually sensible Alfred takes Robin's sense makes this script even more illogical, considering Wayne's reasons for pulling Robin back are perfectly understandable.Of course, the script isn't helped much by Schumacher's poorly done direction. The fact that the opening shots of the film feature close-ups on Batman and Robin's rear-end and glued-on nipples is not a good sign of things to come. He gives so much attention to the over-stylised sets and poorly rendered special effects, that the actors are left to wollow and stand around in the background, while the stuntmen do the more difficult work. George Clooney's usual Cary Grant-like charm is lost here and the few times in the film that Wayne thinks about his parent's death, he just looks like he is thinking about what to eat for breakfast. Chris O'Donnell was passable in Batman Forever, but in this film, he is just flat and he does nothing to make us care about his character. Schwarzneggar is also un-helped by his material and everything that made him a frightening Terminator seems to have disappeared in his portrayal of Freeze. Watching his performance here, it is not surprising as to why he decided to enter politics. Michael Gough, who was rather solid in the previous films is given an elevated part here, but his performance is so hammy that we unfortunately watch as Bruce Wayne's best friend wilters away, which should not be the effect.The only actor in the whole film who actually comes out well is Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy. Unlike Clooney or Schwarzneggar, she understands the cartoonish feel out of the whole production and is appropriately hammy. Despite the embarrassing script she's given, she manages to make Poison Ivy a compelling and interesting villain. Every time Thurman appears on screen, the film gets considerably less painful to watch as she proves to be very entertaining. In fact, if Ivy was made the main villain and Freeze was taken out, the final result would have been much more watchable, though as proved by what was released, the film would still have been a lost cause. Nonetheless, Thurman gives an incredibly well done performance that is quite possibly the only memorable aspect of Batman & Robin. Unfortunately, despite Thurman's best efforts, even she is not enough to recommend this completely poorly done two-hour cheese-fest drivel and the bane of both Joel Schumacher's career and the entire Batman legacy.

I thought it would be some kind of corny comedy and what convinced me to watch it was the cast. But 'Pleasantville' is so much more than I expected.It touches a very interesting theme of what people think of the 1950's America based on the movies and sitcoms. Most of these media portray it so stereotypically as a result of which people are under the illusion that it was a time of innocence, when people followed rules and were always 'happy', when there was no sex or violence and history was just perfect. All the women had 'perfect' hair and makeup, the guys had 'perfectly' combed hair and would wear suits or uniforms. The characters never swore etc. But, that's not how life really was and this is what 'Pleasantville' beautifully demonstrates. There aren't many well-known films or series that depict the 50's more realistically. In this film, we see that the more the characters break away from stereotype and act out of their own free will, the more realistic the 'life' becomes in the town. The colour and black and white contrast plays a crucial role as it stresses on the stereotype (that is marked with extreme colours such as black and white) but gradually people make their own choices and add more colour to their life. Through the character of the mayor, Ross also portrays the irony of society. The mayor stands against the 'colouring' of society and he gets people to protest for him yet he too, just like everyone else, has his own secret desires. Yet, it isn't only about making choices, it's about discovering something new, something that shows that there's always more to life than its present state like Jennifer's new-find interest in books, Bill's passion for painting and Betty's new-find self.Ross deserves most of the credit for his innovative writing and crafty direction. He touches on several themes such as racism and sexism. The 50's movie feel is nicely done with the score, the costumes, the sets and the acting. I really liked how Ross brought the surprise element but I hope people do not reject this film thinking that it's some silly film about two modern-day spoilt teens' adventure in a 50's sitcom. At least for me, the unusual cast drew my attention (I had forgotten that Ross was also the man behind 'Seabiscuit'). A supercute Reese Witherspoon and a naive Tobey McGuire are very convincing as siblings. Moreover, both show David and Jennifer's growth with élan. Joan Allen would make for a hot 50's mom. The actress is sublime. Likewise Jeff Daniels and William H. Macy are superb.'Pleasantville' remains good entertainment while it presents some relevant themes with class.

Michael Winner may not be a great director; but his films generally turn out to be entertaining in spite of not being brilliant, and with a story as strong as this one; I felt confident that The Big Sleep would be a good film. However, as it turns out; this film is not as good as it could have been. The story focuses on private investigator Philip Marlowe. He is hired by an old man who goes by the name of General Sternwood to investigate a case of blackmail against one of his daughters. After meeting the daughters and some of the other main players involved, our hero soon comes to the conclusion that the blackmail doesn't really constitute a threat and becomes suspicious; leading to him thinking that everything seems to be more connected with the disappearance of the man's son in law, and decides to investigate that instead.For one reason or another, Michael Winner has decided to move things over to England; although the lead man remains American. This change in location has not really had an effect on the story; but it did leave Winner free to recruit an excellent roster of British stars. Among the names in the cast list are Oliver Reed, John Mills, Joan Collins, Richard Boone and Edward Fox. The film is lead by Robert Mitchum, who while not as great as Humphrey Bogart, still makes an excellent leading man and there's also enough room in the cast for an aging James Stewart. The film is a lot shorter than the earlier version of this story and Winner has really trimmed things down a lot, which means that the story is much more straight forward than it was in the 1946 film. This is not really a bad thing as it does mean that the film is easier to follow; although it also seems less expansive. The characters take something of a backseat too, with only the lead character getting any real development. Still, this is at least an entertaining thriller and I don't feel like I wasted my time watching it; although Howard Hawks' version is better.

What I remembered from first viewing of Cape Fear, about 8 years ago, is that that was one scary movie. I was only a kid back then, but even after all these years I felt again that this movie gives great doze of fear. Mostly it is because of brilliant portrayal coming from Robert De Niro (Max Cady is definitely not kind of guy who you wanna meet) and great Martin Scorsese ability to 'manufacture' terrifying scenes (for example when Nolte is hiding behind trash cans and when De Niro says 'Counselor, could you be there?' - that one reminded me of Walter Hill's The Warriors and Luther in the same movie). Scorsese + De Niro (his all time favorite) never fails to deliver when they have as good script as this. Here, there is relationship between lawyers and clients, parents and children; also law in America is comprehended, where are holes in system, what can or cannot man do to protect his family and so on. I also read some of the comments that compare this one with the original and spits on this movie. To those people I say that this is an Oscar winning picture for some remakes I have seen in my life. If Mitchum and Peck (stars from the original) gave their blessing why can't you? So, I advise you to take a look at this Scorsese picture because it's scary, with Hitchcock elements and great acting coming from all actors involved. This is a great horror\/thriller!!!

Here, there is relationship between lawyers and clients, parents and children; also law in America is comprehended, where are holes in system, what can or cannot man do to protect his family and so on. I also read some of the comments that compare this one with the original and spits on this movie. To those people I say that this is an Oscar winning picture for some remakes I have seen in my life. If Mitchum and Peck (stars from the original) gave their blessing why can't you? So, I advise you to take a look at this Scorsese picture because it's scary, with Hitchcock elements and great acting coming from all actors involved. This is a great horror\/thriller!!!

If not, you will probably turn it off after a few minutes. The first Mummy picture was quite good, in that it managed to fit in characters and plot amongst the big budget special effects. The first picture showed that Universal movie monsters could easily be remade into big budget, special effect extravaganzas, and still be good. Everything I liked about the first movie (minus the characters) was overdone to the extreme here, and about halfway through or earlier, I found myself loathing this picture. The overall feeling though was not one of hatred...this is just an overplotted mess, with moderate entertainment value throughout.Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) is back, nine years after the first movie (I thought it was two, but whatever), and he and Evelyn (Racchel Weisz) are married and have an 8 year old kid, Alex (Freddie Boath). Imhotep's (Arnold Vosloo) mummy has been brought back to life, and he wants the bracelet of immortality, which is now in the hands of Rick and company. The bracelet controls the Scorpion King's (played in a pointless cameo by the Rock) army, which consists of easy to defeat dogs who with one hit turn to sand. Chaos ensues throughout.If you aren't paying attention in this movie, or you miss the first ten minutes, you will be extremely confused. Heck, you could be paying attention the whole movie and still be confused. So much is going on, and so many special effects and new plot lines are shoved in your face way too often. Special effects on the mummies and creatures are pretty cool, but the bigger effects are just a huge headache, and they look very artificial. The plot is virtually nonexistent. I guess there are several plot lines, but in between them are many sidetracked scenes, and by the end, this just feels like a bunch of random scenes shoved together.This movie is full of cutesy moments. I'm unsure as to why a mummy movie needs any cutesy moments, but since this is meant for families, writer and director Stephen Sommers made this both violent and cutesy and comedic, so it never fully works as anything (though it does work much better as an action movie than anything else). Jonathan (John Hannah) provides many of the movies cringe worthy lines. He's one of those characters that is scared to death from anything and everything, and still quips out the bad jokes. Brendan Fraser does the same, but he has a charm he brings to the character, and is one of the few positives of the movie. The kid Alex was a good addition, and for some reason, he felt more mature and developed than most other parts of the movie.Overall, this is a pretty bad movie. It's full of effects that add up to nothing, and characters that do the same. There is some entertainment to be found, but you may find after you finish this, you'll be in desperate need for something intelligent.My rating * 1\/2 out of ****. 125 mins. PG-13 for violence.

It causes many mixed emotions - but perhaps that was the intent of the writer and director. This tale reminds me somewhat of Bridges Of Madison County, in that a bored housewife can so quickly find herself falling for a complete stranger. Also in both movies, the women had decent nice husbands, although a little on the boring, safe side - which makes the unfaithfulness all the more difficult to justify. Of course there is the huge difference in that BOMC results is a consummated adulterous affair, whereas BE does not - and of course that is probably due to a reflection in the times they were made (1945 vs.1995). But both movies are the same in that they ultimately do the right thing in the end and stay with their husbands. I'm still actually surprised that a 40's movie tackled the subject of an affair so openly. I guess it was considered okay provided the end result was the saving of the marriage...I don't know since that was way before my time.I found the cinematography quite beautiful and sweeping in the imagery conveyed - especially the train station scenes with the smoke were quite beautiful in black and white. I also loved that the music score was Rachmaninoff's Piano concerto No.2 - one of the most romantic pieces ever composed.My biggest downside is that I never really bought the chemistry between Johnson and Howard. I get that maybe they had purposely cast less-than attractive actors for the parts so ordinary folk could relate to them.

Here you have a group of buddies who run out of gas somewhere in Texas and who go check out the childhood home of two of them while waiting for the gas station to get refueled. One-by-one, they stumble onto a house where Leatherface proceeds to take care of them.A lot of people praise this film for its technique of not actually showing anything, making it that much more powerful. The thing is this was not due to artistic choice, but rather lack of budget. I'm not at all an advocate of more gore is better but I can't say I appreciated the demonstration of terror in this movie, which basically consisted in a whole lot of screaming and extreme close-ups of the actors' faces. So if you're looking for actual cool scenes, the remake is the way to go.That being said, Tobe Hooper's film is also more realistic and believable than Marcus Nispel's, from the reason the teens are stranded to Leatherface's house (it actually looks normal from the outside, somewhere you actually would go knock at the door to ask a question). Also the 70s teens in this movie are obviously much better at playing teens from the 70s than Jessica Biel and her buddies (the remake could easily have been set in the present day, you wouldn't know the difference).It's pretty amazing that the same cinematographer worked on both films considering how different they look. Obviously 30 years separate the two films and the remake had a much bigger budget, but still... All in all, while the remake is better looking, cooler and a more pleasant viewing experience (at least for me), the original is more believable and has a better storyline and better characters.I guess it's good for what it is, but I feel it's quite overrated.

The One is like some sort of cross between Sliders (1995 - 2000) & Timecop (1994), it sees some somewhat confusing & often silly idea that there are lots of parallel worlds that are populated by the same people & if one is killed his strength is divided up between the survivors until there is only one left who will be all powerful or something like that. At only just over 80 odd minutes the film moves along like a rocket, if fact there's barely any exposition or character development at all although having said that there's plenty of action, martial arts, explosions & special effects to keep one happy. It certainly worked for me anyway. The story is just an excuse to have two super hard Jet Li's running around fighting each other & causing plenty of destructive mayhem which is no bad thing in itself I suppose.
