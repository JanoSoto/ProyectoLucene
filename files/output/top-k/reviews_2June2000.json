But look closer at what this film is, listen more to what it has to say and it may not be the silly farce that people say it is.There is one particular scene where one of the Afghans is talking about how war is considered great if you have honour.  It is an honour to be a martyr, it is an honour to die for Jesus Chirst or Allah or Buddha or The Easter Bunny.  Now a days, people declare war in everyone's name.  He then goes on to tell a story about how the Russians dropped toys into the villages and when little children picked them up, they exploded and took off an arm or scarred them for life or killed them.Where is the honour in that? he wonders out loud.  That is a good question.  Maybe Rambo got carried away and the character became larger than life but the one thing that his character has always done in every film is have an anti war attitude.

Although I guess you could say if there's a theme to the film, it might be 'be careful what you wish for. -- Woody AllenWoody Allen is one of America's best, most original, and prolific masters of comedy. You have to go back to Chaplin and Keaton to find another film maker who's in such total control of his work. He writes, directs, and acts with such skill and success that he has no equal today. It's hard to find anybody who doesn't have an opinion on him. People either think he's hilarious, or just not funny, or that he's (shudder) not as funny as he used to be. To each his own. The guy's still an enigmatic genius. One of the most revered and most imitated film makers of any generation. He may or may not be past his prime, but on his worst days, he's still better than most.&#145;Small Time Crooks' is no masterpiece, if that's what you're looking for, but a gentle, amusing farce, complete with laughs, and more of Woody performing his film persona as only he can. If I compared it to all his previous work, I'd end up telling you what it's not. Let me tell you what it is, or at least what I thought I saw. I saw shades of the younger Woody (he's 64 now, okay?) surrounded by newer people trying to entertain in a light and silly story that has a twist, or turn.Ray `The Brain' Winkler (The Wood Man), is an ex-con dishwasher with a scheme to rob a bank. Frenchy (Tracey Ullman, who was born to do this kind of thing), is his manicurist wife who also bakes cookies. He talks her into sinking their life savings into a plan he's devised with his buddies (Michael Rapaport, Jon Lovitz, and Tony Darrow). Frenchy's cousin May (the legendary Elaine May), becomes involved, and serves as the family's weak link. Usually, you expect that Allen's characters only success to be at failure. Expected him and his dim-witted gang to botch the robbery somehow. Maybe not so quickly. I expected them to... I don't know, not become rich and learn that they're better off that way. But Allen, in his unique way, asks the questions, `What if they got what they wished for? What would they do? What might become of them?' Some people should not be rich. They just aren't cut out to have wealth. Frenchy enlists the aid of David (Hugh Grant), a snobbish art dealer, to help her become cultured and refined, hence, the conflict and comedy. With all that talent involved, expectations run pretty high.There are some funny moments, some clever dialogue, and some reminders of scenes past, but this is not the best Woody Allen movie ever. It lacks a certain overall `oomph.' Not a lot of big laughs. The gang of crooks disappear in the middle, Elaine May has very little to do, and it never really turns wacky, zany, dangerous, outrageous, or totally hilarious. It becomes centered on Ray and Frenchy's relationship, and settles into a sentimental look at the couple. We're supposed to think that money is a real threat to their marriage, I guess. Allen and Ullman have great chemistry, and that's sweet, but it seems like it could have been put to better use. I'm not saying don't go see the movie. Just don't expect to be blown away by Woody's finest effort in years. We still have him, though. After 47 years in the comedy profession, he starts at least one new original project every fall. He's still at it, writing, directing, and acting. That's the main thing. Believe me. E-mail and comments are welcome.

It's hard to find anybody who doesn't have an opinion on him. People either think he's hilarious, or just not funny, or that he's (shudder) not as funny as he used to be. To each his own.

He may or may not be past his prime, but on his worst days, he's still better than most.&#145;Small Time Crooks' is no masterpiece, if that's what you're looking for, but a gentle, amusing farce, complete with laughs, and more of Woody performing his film persona as only he can. If I compared it to all his previous work, I'd end up telling you what it's not. Let me tell you what it is, or at least what I thought I saw. I saw shades of the younger Woody (he's 64 now, okay?) surrounded by newer people trying to entertain in a light and silly story that has a twist, or turn.Ray `The Brain' Winkler (The Wood Man), is an ex-con dishwasher with a scheme to rob a bank. Frenchy (Tracey Ullman, who was born to do this kind of thing), is his manicurist wife who also bakes cookies. He talks her into sinking their life savings into a plan he's devised with his buddies (Michael Rapaport, Jon Lovitz, and Tony Darrow). Frenchy's cousin May (the legendary Elaine May), becomes involved, and serves as the family's weak link. Usually, you expect that Allen's characters only success to be at failure. Expected him and his dim-witted gang to botch the robbery somehow. Maybe not so quickly. I expected them to... I don't know, not become rich and learn that they're better off that way. But Allen, in his unique way, asks the questions, `What if they got what they wished for? What would they do? What might become of them?' Some people should not be rich. They just aren't cut out to have wealth. Frenchy enlists the aid of David (Hugh Grant), a snobbish art dealer, to help her become cultured and refined, hence, the conflict and comedy. With all that talent involved, expectations run pretty high.There are some funny moments, some clever dialogue, and some reminders of scenes past, but this is not the best Woody Allen movie ever. It lacks a certain overall `oomph.' Not a lot of big laughs. The gang of crooks disappear in the middle, Elaine May has very little to do, and it never really turns wacky, zany, dangerous, outrageous, or totally hilarious. It becomes centered on Ray and Frenchy's relationship, and settles into a sentimental look at the couple. We're supposed to think that money is a real threat to their marriage, I guess. Allen and Ullman have great chemistry, and that's sweet, but it seems like it could have been put to better use. I'm not saying don't go see the movie. Just don't expect to be blown away by Woody's finest effort in years. We still have him, though. After 47 years in the comedy profession, he starts at least one new original project every fall. He's still at it, writing, directing, and acting. That's the main thing. Believe me. E-mail and comments are welcome.

Sword and sandals epics, they're called. Togas and tigers. Chariots and fire. Arenas and amphitheaters. Columns and colosseums. The new movie, Gladiator, is chance to see all that stuff. That was about what I expected. Not a day at the beach.You have to remember the genre. The filming expenses became greater than the box office totals, so, they haven't made this kind of movie in almost 40 years. The subject matter is violence. Got that? A gladiator fights to the death. Therefore, the main course here is bloody, hand-to-hand combat, served with war, duty, ambition, murder, injustice, betrayal, and revenge, with small side orders of politics and philosophy. And for dessert, more blood and death. A friendly word of advice? Don't sit in the first two rows. By today's standards, it has to come out different than what's been done before. It comes out dark, somber, dour, gloomy, and computer-generated. Yeah, I really miss those light-hearted films about ancient Romans and barbarians, too, but what do you think it was really like? I know I wouldn't want to live back then. Neither would Kirk Douglas, Charleton Heston, nor the late Victor Mature, nor the late Steve Reeves, I'm guessing.This movie is getting mixed reviews. I suppose it could have been better in some ways, but that really depends on what you're looking for. It's a tragedy, not `the feel good movie of the summer.' Do some people just not get that? This may be the reason for the conflicting opinions. It doesn't matter if you know the story ahead of time. Just don't expect to be uplifted and spiritually renewed. All I expected was good acting and some entertainment value. I spent $4.50 at a 130 p.m. matinee, and can say I was entertained at times, and certainly didn't feel it was a waste of time and money. Not at all. The ones who get short-changed are women. Their roles in these kinds of movies are nearly always dumb. No exception here.Russell Crowe is always good. He is the movie. If I didn't know any better, I could have sworn that at times he sounded exactly like Mel Gibson, especially in a rare split second when a line of dialogue was delivered with his back is to the camera. Must be the Aussie influence. His committment to his work, both physically and mentally, is amazing to watch. We have far too few, and can never have too many actors like that. Somebody said they'd pay money to watch him stand around and drink beer. What greater compliment is there?Somebody has to play the bad guy. Joaquin Phoenix has the perfect look for the part, and seems committed, but ends up looking like he's in over his head. Okay, he got this acting job to do a movie with none other than Crowe, Oliver Reed and Richard Harris. That might be a bit intimidating, no? It would be hard for most of us not to look like we suck sharing the screen with those guys. It's a part for a young Roddy McDowall type, and Phoenix did provided the insipid total psychopath needed, but nobody in this movie was even allowed to have any fun.The late Oliver Reed's farewell performance was excellent. I loved him in the Musketeers movies of the 70's, and was glad to see him working until the end. That's one way to go, isn't it?I thought the special effects were rather seamless, though some of the landscapes do look like gorgeous computer paintings. Though no doubt it makes Rome look better than it was, I thought it strange that I never saw an aqueduct, nor any sunshine. I couldn't tell that England wasn't Germania, and Malta, where a lot of this was shot, is really one awesome-looking place. As far as the action, I noticed from the first battle scene that they had so many fast cuts and too-close close-ups, and so much shaky camera crap that it was mission impossible to actually follow what was happening physical-action-wise from moment to moment. That bothered me, but I doubt they wanted to be too graphic too soon, and figured they first wanted to give a basic feel for the violence, rather than glory in the bloody details.

I can ignore shallow characters, dumb dialogue and simplistic plot, but I can never forgive dullness and the lack of genuine excitement. And MI2 was DULL with capital D.Apart from the motorcycle chase which was pretty neat, there was no action scene that didn't remind me of another similar action scene in a much better movie. It even rips the original MI's most famous scene, with Cruise being suspended on a cord. I suppose it was intended as a wink-wink reference, but it comes off as trite and recycled instead. There's way too much slow motion, and what's the deal with those constant close-ups on the face?I went to this movie with no expectations other than having a blast of a time without putting any pressure on the brain. Instead, it disappointed me on every single level I could think of. I give it 1 out of 10.

Hey, I like her as much as the next guy. She's easy on the eyes, and never plays dumb. Girls like her, guys like her, and so do parents. Seems like she hasn't got an enemy in the world. We love her. We root for her. We're on her side. We have to get our Julia fix three or four times every twelve months to get through our movie-watching year. Everything you could want in one of her pictures is played for all it's worth in Erin Brockovich.  It's the kind of movie that defines the term `star vehicle.' Not only is she the main character, but she's in every single scene, and everybody else is just there to make her look good. This is the way to market your star-power and rake it in at the box office... again.It's based on a true story, if you haven't heard, and is about a plucky, twice divorced, mother of three, who dresses like a hooker, but manages to talk her way into a job working for a lawyer, played perfectly by Albert Finney. I guess she figures all women would dress slutty if they looked as good as she does. At work, she finds out there's more to one of his neglected pro bono cases than first thought, and they eventually file suit against a big California power company for poisoning the water in a rural community with hexevalent chromium and trying to get away with it. With no law degree or training, she works very hard and uses her `charms' (They're called boobs, Ed.) and `people skills' to fight for what's right. She's bitchy to almost everybody (`Bite me, Krispy Kreme!') except the people of the town, to whom she's as sweet as can be. George, played admirably by Aaron Eckhart, is her only romantic interest (next door neighbor\/babysitter\/biker dude boyfriend) who gets the good and bad of both sides of her personality. The real Erin B. has a cameo role as a waitress.There's talk about Julia being considered for another Academy Award nomination because of this movie. I don't know, that's a possibility, but I'd rather see her actually win an Oscar in a more complete film. I'm sure she has her pick of scripts. I'd like to someday see her in a gritty human drama where she doesn't care what she looks like and just acts her buns off. I think she can do it. The director, Steven Soderberg, concentrated so much on keeping the camera on her and the wardrobe, that something about the rest of it didn't hold up.  I wonder which is better, getting a 20 million dollar paycheck for one movie, or getting an Oscar. That's something most of us will never know. I did enjoy much of the movie, maybe a little more than when I saw her play herself in Notting Hill. I  never felt it was a waste of time or money.

So serious that God Almighty has decided to shove them back to Earth. After a couple of millenia, the two budding anti-heros decide it is time to get back to heaven. The only way to get back is to get through the Arch of a church in New Jersey during a centenary ceremnoy. That way, not only they get back to heaven, but they also prove that there is a loophole in the laws of heaven. And God Almightly certainly doesn't want THAT to happen.  It would be sure to ruin existance as we know it. More worrying is the fact that Azarel himself has decided to help the two anti-heros in their quest for gaining heaven back. So God sends a hoarde of people to save the day and the world as we know it today. The Sign (Bethany, who works at an abortion clinic), The 13th Apostle (Rufus), the Prophets (Jay and Silent Bob) and Metarton (the Serafin), who is also known as the Voice of God. And of course the proverbial Muse who tires to help as best as she can.Dogma is not a movie to be taken seriously. If it was, it would be of great offence not only to the catholics, but to all believers in general. Instead, it has to be taken lightly, for what it is, at times with a pinch of salt. The movie's greatest strength does not lie in the storyline - in fact, the second part of the movie is as close to absurd as one can possibly get. The script in itself though is incredibly funny, and the film does present us with some surprisingly weird yet incredibly good situations. In particular, I liked Kevin Smith's Silent Bob and of course the hilarious 13th Appostle (played by Chris Rock) who not only claims that he was left out of the Bible on purpose, but also makes some shocking revelations about Christ, the Holy Mary and God Almightly.One cannot fail to mention Alanis Morisette's five minute apparition.  Her interpretation of 'God' literally steals the show in the last part of the movie.In spite of my initial misgivings about the topic and the rather, unfortunately, absurd ending, I found Dogma a highly enjoyable movie, deserving a good 8\/10 for originality and for giving me one of the best laughs in months.

Russel and Stallone doing comedy together is quite interesting in itself.  But remember, these are two proud action stars.  At least they were at this stage of their careers.  Clearly Stallone was looking to curve his reputation just a little bit.  Here, he comes across as a smart and dapper L.A. detective that just happens to tough as nails.  Russell plays the role that Stallone would have played maybe even three years ago.  But the change in character works for Stallone.  This also gives Russell a chance to look even tougher and funnier.  One particular scene that is played to perfecttion is when Russell and Stallone are in court together and they are given a chance to say some last words.  Tango says some eloquent words to the effect of all of his buddies being great cops and facing up to adversity with pride.  He then sits down and Russell, Cash, scruffy looking hooligan that he is, stands and says in a soft and demure manner,Well I wish I could be as eloquent as my partner here... but I can't..... because.. this....whole thing just freakin' sucks!!!Action is the driving force behind Tango and Cash but comedy is its forte.  These two guys play well off each other and even Palance does what he can with what he is given, which isn't much.  One has to assume that he accepted this role for a paycheck only.Another great character in the film is the one played by Michael J. Pollard, as the guy in the lab that seems to make all the silly police gadgets that Tango and Cash use.  Now, would there be a guy like this in the L.A. police department?  I doubt it but he sure is a fun guy to have around in a film like this.Tango and Cash is a great rental.  It is probably a film that most people have forgotten about but it is worth another chance, especially since you can get it on video.  Stallone and Russell are magic together and there is enough comedy to keep everyone laughing.And Teri Hatcher isn't bad to look at either.7 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"2 June 2000","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  This is a film that was funny when it first came out and after seeing it for the first time in about eight years, I have to say that it is even funnier now.

You don't want to go to bed, but you don't want to do anything mentally stimulating. I watched this all the time with my younger brother at that time of night.

Is it just script choices, dumb luck, or is it who you know? Haven't seen all his movies, but, out of the 24 he's made since then, I saw eight. Anyway, you pretty much know what to expect. He's not exactly a chameleon, the camera really likes him, and he's a working movie actor with a genuine career, though I haven't quite been able to figure out exactly why. I would never ever pay to watch him stand around drinking beer, like I would Russell Crowe or Gary Oldman, but I have to admit that sometimes he comes through. Frequency is one of his times. Even as the plot turns to Swiss cheese, at least the actors believe it and give solid performances. You can always count on Quaid if the part calls for a grown man who never grew up. He plays a loving father and husband, a hard-working fireman in Queens, NY, and `a big kid.'The story is tricky, to say the least. There must have been a Twilight Zone episode similar to it. Though the movie doesn't start there, the first thing to accept, is that a young homicide detective, John Sullivan (James Caviezel), has lived in the same house for all 36 years of his life. Mom moved out, but, he's still there. Okay. Second, because of abnormal atmospheric conditions in October 1969 and October 1999, radio signals get bounced all over outer space, and John starts talking to his own father (Quaid) on the same ham radio set reaching 30 years into the past - just days before fire-fighter Dad dies in the line of duty. All right. They share information that changes the past, present and future. Of course, everybody knows that when you do that sort of thing bad things happen, too. So, you have to fix the mess you created. If you change one thing in the past, all the possible futures change, too. Don't think too hard about it, or you'll get a  headache. You just have to watch the movie and not ask too many questions, especially in the last 30 minutes. They end up trying to stop a serial killer and trying to keep the family together.

It was so American, and our love for it was passionate, innocent and pure. That's another thing they make movies about.The heart of the story, besides what we'd do if we had a magic ham radio, is the relationship between a father and son. The male bonding that never happened before happens on the radio and we feel their closeness. The value of family is the main message. What if your father died when you were six years old, but as an adult, you could ignore time and call him on the phone back when he was alive? I guess we've all had dreams of going back into the past somewhere, sometime, somehow. I know I have.

Anyway, I'm the kind of movie-goer who decides, in that moment when getting up out of my seat at the end, after                                         watching for the ENTIRE 82 minutes, whether or not I got my money's worth.                                        I had visited the movie's official web site beforehand. I even heard word-of-mouth about the flick from people who                                         had seen the Sci-Fi Channel's coverage on it. I knew it wasn't true. I knew that this movie created a buzz at                                         Sundance, and in movie circles in print and online. I realize that these neophyte film makers wanted to produce a                                         successful movie. I don't know if they actually think this work is any more than performance art, or if they think it's                                         a milestone in cinematic expression. By any standards, one that puts the asses in the seats to the tune of over $36M                                         in less than a week of its nationwide release, especially when it cost only $25K or $60K to make, (depending on                                         what article is correct) qualifies it as a HUGE success. I only wish that it had been a better movie. I can't help but                                         feel I've been taken by the gimmick. The hype is rarely ever matched by the product, is it? It wasn't supposed to be a                                         real movie was it? Just documentary footage that was found and put together. That would cover a multitude of                                         cinematic sins, wouldn't it? Doesn't hurt to cover your bases, does it? It could even be bad, huh?                                        Ingenious as it is, the marketing of this production-on-a-shoestring delivers a first effort that left me unsatisfied. I                                         agree that there were a few great moments that were genuinely creepy, but they were separated by far too much                                         tedious repetition included for the sake of realism. The fighting, yelling, and screaming at each other came quite                                         quickly, it seems, for a movie that went so slowly. After only a couple days in the woods they mentally fell apart.                                         The improvised acting suffered a bit there. The things that went bump in the night promised something more that                                         never came. The distant unknown sounds and voices were as scary as it got, and could have led to something else,                                         but never really did, beyond the blurry images inside the house, maybe. The ending was actually a relief. It finally                                         put an end to the crying, the yelling, the shaking camera, and the almost endless asking, What was that??!!! We                                         never do find out, and have to figure it must've been the wicked witch of Blair. It WAS something. Right? I have to                                         laugh at the people who say they're the only one who got the movie. Many people are reading things into this                                         movie's ending, but if it makes you feel better...                                        You can discuss whether or not the actors are hotties, thanks to the previous Scream and ...Last Summer                                         movies, and talk about the ticket sales and statistics, but why not talk about what makes some movies really good,                                         others really great, and some a waste of time. I can't say this one was a waste. You should see what the fuss and                                         hype is all about, but don't expect a classic. There are people risking fortunes every day who think they know what                                         would make a good movie. These particular guys accomplished something imaginative that will certainly be                                         imitated. They tried to scare us without using a big bank roll, special effects, gore, monster costumes, puppets, guns,                                         explosions, or gratuitous nudity, sex and violence. That alone is a novel idea. They used sticks and stones and                                         sounds and darkness. I consider that an extremely brave approach when you're aiming at the cynical,                                         computer-literate, self-absorbed, seen-it-all, mostly 17-34 year old, MTV Generation movie audience member who                                         just forked over $4.25 to $9.00 per person and said, Okay, now scare me.                                         Hey, if I could make a better movie I would. I'm only speaking from an actor's perspective, and as a person who                                         likes movies. They're the ones who had the guts to turn a few good ideas into millions at the box office, not me.                                         I'm the kind of movie-goer who is hopeful.

It would be nice to get my money's worth. I                                         wonder if they need any more unknown actors...

It would be nice to get my money's worth. I                                         wonder if they need any more unknown actors...

Amadeus for one was a powerful expose of the legendary composer; Forman was able to extraordinarily add so much spice to the script that the end result was a harrowing documentation that genuinely moved us. We didn't need to know anything about the composer or even like his work or personality; Forman craves on these sorts of challenges. He likes to make films about characters that the audience may not identify with because it heightens the overall achivement if the film  is a hit. With Larry Flynt he's done it again.Flynt is the story of Porn magazine chairman larry Flynt who amidst an era of overwhelming decadance launched Hustler magazine, a porn magazine that broke all taboos and crossed all boundaries. The magazine was a huge hit that transformed Flynt into a powerful figure in the American Community. Needless to say though, Flynt (superbly played by Harrelson) faces insurmountable odds from everyone to keep the business running. Politicians, reverends, mass public opposition et.al.. Flynt is accompanied along the way by his junkie wife (played with real panache by Courtney Love) and a reluctant lawyer (dependable performance from Edward Norton Jr.). At the midway point of the film Flynt is shot and paralyzed and consequently the fight to stay on top is made even more challenging.This story is intriguing because is dares to break universal taboo's. It shows Flynt disassociating himself from the norms and traditions of society and really willing to take genuine risks that could blow up in his face. Before Hustler was formed, Playboy was the porno pioneer. Playboy was subtle in it's nudity, preferring to call itself a REAL magazine rather than something trashy. We notice that Playboy was afraid to overstep the barrier. Playboy was a magazine that was restricted in it's disclosure of barenaked ladies because of the shape of society at the time and the values the society had come to embrace. To call yourself a porno magazine was unthinkable with unthinkable consequences! Hustler dared to step over those lines and bear all the consequences. Flynt was not necessarily a likeable man but he cannot not be admired. He was a risk taker, an enterpeneur, a man with a vision, and a man who believed that oe should act on one's desires and ambitions.The mass hysteria the swamps the society as a consequence mainfests how powerful yet dangerous a little acting on ambition can bring. Flynt's idea is impossible to resist; the public cannot stay away from the controversial impact of the magazine. As the fan base grows, so does Flynt's empire, and so do the forces determined to suppress him. Flynt's meteoric rise is unprecedented, and made all the more shocking by the fact that the evnets are real. His opposition ranges from hypocritical politicians to dubious religious figures, all of whom are hell-bent on the abolition of Flynt and his tremendous reach.The film earns huge plaudits on the entertainment level. This is undisputed!! The acting demonstartes tremendous range from all involved and Flynt is an offensive yet endearing, and very funny figure. We grow to really love and root for him as the film develops. The points that necessitate discussion however are the legal and moral issues that are debated by Flynt, his lawyer, and the opposition. The freedom of press, of speech, and the freedom to exercise your FREEDOM are all fiercely debated. Flynt vehemently defends his position because he feels that the world is afraid to agree with him, that the world is afraid to speak out. The world is polluted by hypocrits; he's the only pure seed. This presents tremendous irony because Flynt is a low-class pervert up against scholars, and politicians, and bureaucrats, and yet he's claiming that he's the real deal and they are all phonies. He has a point; what's the point in looking presentable and being well-educated if you are  banal, hollow, and insipid and cannot open your mind to new ideas?? The film asks that question; we see how closed off the men in power are to Flynt's ideas and we grow to hate them. Then we are torn because we are reluctant to accept the values of a porn fiend. The fact that we cannot resist Flynt's pulling power is the sign of the film's success. We start off opposing Flynt, unable to identify. Then we try and take a neutral stand as we discover the ugliness of Flynt's opponents. Finally, after Flynt is paralyzed and yet continues to defend his honour, we can no longer resist the seduction.The film has Flynt giving amazing speeches about why he is doing justice to himself and the people. He's giving them what they want,they are taking it,and yet they are determined to censor him. He debates this point to manifest the outstanding hypocrisy that lies at the heart of society. Flynt is such an important character because he speaks for all of us. On countless occasions, we all seek to expose the two-faced ugliness of those around us. We just can't because not enough people are listening. Flynt however gets eveyone's attention and defends his honour, preserves his integrity, and succeeds in winning over the justice system. The final speech given by Issacman, his lawyer is very insightful and very powerful for it argues this very point 'We don't need to like what Larry Flynt does, but we should like and appreciate the fact that we have the right to make that decision on our own, and that's what makes our society great. We have the right to accept or reject the offer on hand. We may well reject it but we and we alone need to have the choice made available to us. If that right is taken away, then we wither away as a people and our individuality is nullified' The speech is amazing because it demonstrates how the right to accept a porn fiend and his work preserves the democracy of the Western World. Truly Shocking but brilliant!!!I haven't discussed the other characters all that much and I'm not going to except say this All the characters are multi-dimensional because what we see on the outside is never what we get on the inside. Flynt for all his crude, perverted behaviour is an admirable, likeable, highly identifiable personality. His wife, for all her vulgarity and drug addiction is an endearing, loyal,intelligent personality. Issacman, the lawyer, for all his traditional, stiff boring work ethic, is an idealistic, shrewd, and deeply committed man....The list goes on and onI loved this movie because our hero is not perfect; he's anything but!!! Movies that depict the hero as a flawed individual stand a better chance of being embraced by critics and audiences alike. Flynt thrives on this! And exposing hypocrits for their true selves is every cynics (and I happen to be a huge one) dream. Flynt's journey is whopping emotional tour de force!!!! You don't have to like Larry Flynt as a film, but I love the fact that I had the right to make up my own mind!! Society, you ignore that at your peril!!!

From Astaire to Kelly to Hines, it's the poetry of motion. If you have any appreciation for the art form whatsoever, the one to see right now is Center Stage. It's about a school year in the life of three teenage girls who are roommates at a ballet academy in New York. They pass the auditions to get into the school, but then have to work as hard as possible to move on from there. At the end of the year is a workshop performance where they can be seen by most of the people in the industry who could hire them, including the resident company. They work toward and hope for a career in the most demanding pursuit imaginable, facing gifted competition, and placed on a limited schedule. A dancer has ten years, maybe fifteen if they're not injured in order to peak in their career and be the best they can ever be. A singer can sing most of their life. An actor can act all his life. A dancer's clock is ticking. It's only a matter of time before they can only teach and choreograph, so there's a unique sense of urgency to start young, study hard, and survive. All that might make a good movie. Might not.Along with the good, you have to take the less than good. The characters are nothing new. There's the naive female ingénue (Amanda Schull), the bad girl (Zoe Saldana), the favorite girl (Susan May Pratt), the cocky lead boy (Ethan Stiefel, hailed as the most advanced male dancer in the world), the nice guy dancer (Sascha Radetsky), the nice guy non-dancer (Eion Bailey), the gay friend (Shakiem Evans), the pushy mother (Debra Monk), the demanding teacher (Donna Murphy), and the dictatorial company director (Peter Gallagher). How'd he get in there? There's even a Russian figure skater (Ilia Kulik) in the cast as a dancer. By the way, everybody is amazingly good-looking. Kind of like, Friends as done by George Ballanchine. Only in the movies, right? The story is nothing new either. Will everything work out? Will their dreams come true? Will they survive the heartbreaks of love, and the bodyaches of dance? Well, it's the movies, isn't it? Since the cast features some of the youngest and best dancers in the world, the acting comes second. Often a distant second. Or third. Don't expect any awards to be handed out in that area. Some parts are surprisingly weak, but then they move on and get back to letting their feet do the talking.Did I mention that the only reason to see this is for the dancing? The way it's filmed here is excellent, without actually having to go to a ballet. The beauty of movement, the grace of the girls, and the strength and skill of the boys is captured as well as any other movie in the subject you're likely to see. The big dance numbers at the end are worth seeing by themselves, including more modern styles. Beforehand, there are a couple of dance scenes without ballet. The kids go to a club one night and salsa, and later we see a bunch of Broadway hoofers in a jazz class lead by Priscilla Lopez (original cast of A Chorus Line) that reminded me of scenes in All That Jazz. Those were the most fun. Other scenes will remind you of The Turning Point, White Nights, and even Dirty Dancing. The comparison to Fame is inevitable. That was then, this is a new century. The natural talent, dedication, motivation, support, and ass-busting hard work needed to succeed at this kind of life is touched on here, but also touched on is the sheer love of the game. For dance itself. That's the main thing. E-mail and comments are welcome.

How'd he get in there? There's even a Russian figure skater (Ilia Kulik) in the cast as a dancer. By the way, everybody is amazingly good-looking. Kind of like, Friends as done by George Ballanchine. Only in the movies, right? The story is nothing new either. Will everything work out? Will their dreams come true? Will they survive the heartbreaks of love, and the bodyaches of dance? Well, it's the movies, isn't it? Since the cast features some of the youngest and best dancers in the world, the acting comes second. Often a distant second. Or third. Don't expect any awards to be handed out in that area. Some parts are surprisingly weak, but then they move on and get back to letting their feet do the talking.Did I mention that the only reason to see this is for the dancing? The way it's filmed here is excellent, without actually having to go to a ballet. The beauty of movement, the grace of the girls, and the strength and skill of the boys is captured as well as any other movie in the subject you're likely to see. The big dance numbers at the end are worth seeing by themselves, including more modern styles. Beforehand, there are a couple of dance scenes without ballet. The kids go to a club one night and salsa, and later we see a bunch of Broadway hoofers in a jazz class lead by Priscilla Lopez (original cast of A Chorus Line) that reminded me of scenes in All That Jazz. Those were the most fun. Other scenes will remind you of The Turning Point, White Nights, and even Dirty Dancing. The comparison to Fame is inevitable. That was then, this is a new century. The natural talent, dedication, motivation, support, and ass-busting hard work needed to succeed at this kind of life is touched on here, but also touched on is the sheer love of the game. For dance itself. That's the main thing. E-mail and comments are welcome.

Why?? Because of the ending of course! And the most annoying thing is, that you only get this feeling with movies that are absolutely enjoyable up until that dreadful ending and THAT is just such a shame.The concept of a fake reality is as old as the visions of Plato, and maybe that's a clue to why we find it so fascinating. It's in the nature of humans to ponder about worlds beyond our senses and our desire to `uncover' those worlds. This is why we have some of it in sci-fi episodes from the Twilight Zone, Star Trek  etc. and movies like The Truman Show, The Matrix and&#133;..Dark City. It appeals to a basic human need to look beyond the visible.Alex Proyas uses this concept to create a captivating movie. The viewer quickly identifies with John Murdoch's search for the reason why strange looking men (guys looking like Pinhead from Hellraiser, but without the pins) are trying to capture\/kill him. A beautiful girl (Connelly) and wacky doctor (Sutherland) are included&#133;..and William Hurt has to bring in the needed portion of scepticism (although he isn't sceptic for long. This is all very nice, and as I said very entertaining. But why can't people make some gratifying end to a good movie?? I mean, once you find out what `reality' is, you don't go out (slightly improve the fake reality) and continue with your life? NO!! You make sure you get back to where you came from!!! Or in the case of the Truman Show, out of the fake reality as fast as possible. Ok, this last option can't be &#145;easily' achieved in Dark City like in Matrix or Truman Show , but at least leave the viewer with the knowledge that Murdoch is attempting to get back from wherever he and everybody else came from! Wouldn't you do the same in his place???Even though the ending didn't have a MAJOR plot-hole like in &#145;The Andromeda Strain' (also a good movie except for the ending), I couldn't help but say `WHAT!!!!!!!!!???????' when the credits started rolling over the screen a very good sign the disbelief comes crashing in like thunder.Could have been an 8 out of 10, but now I can only give it a 7 (but with a recommendation to watch if they're showing it on T.V.)
