Again the story revolves around a wide range of criminals, this time from jewel thieves to Russian gangsters. There are two main threads to the plot one following a number of individuals attempting to secure a valuable diamond and another following an unlicensed boxing manager who's gotten into the debt of a particularly ruthless promoter.In my opinion the cast is a little better than the first film but again it contains no real standout performance. There is an authenticity to the performances, even that of Brad Pitt, who delivers my favorite performance of his to date. As with the previous film, those who have trouble with accents may find some of the dialogue hard to follow, especially in the case of Pitt's character (though he's meant to be scarcely intelligible).The story contains a lot of the inventiveness of Ritchie's earlier film but here it stretches out a bit further by having a couple of plot lines running parallel to one another. Ritchie pulls it off and does so with the same comedic touches that marked his first film.Ritchie's direction is once again well-handled and here he shows even more polish than before. He rarely goes overboard with style but the film's slickness isn't quite as fitting as his previous feature's somewhat ragged look. As for the soundtrack, it's solid though it hasn't got nearly as many high points as the soundtrack for Lock, Stock....In the end, this film is likely to please fans of Ritchie's first film and fans of crime films in general. That being said, as you can see by all of the references that I made to Lock, Stock..., if you're looking for something completely original this isn't it.

After seeing the film, however, it is undeniable Whedon had a point although he is the sole credited writer, the Buffy movie is clearly a patchwork of ideas that just don't add up in the end.After a quick introduction to the Slayer mythology, the proper action begins meet Buffy (Kristy Swanson), a classic shallow L.A. girl who spends her days being a cheerleader, shopping with her friends (including Hilary Swank in her film debut) and flirting with hunky football players. Everything changes once she's contacted by Merrick (Donald Sutherland), a member of the Watchers Council, who reveals her true destiny she's the new Slayer, i.e. a woman gifted with special strength that will help her defeat vampires and other demons. Buffy dismisses all the information as nonsense, only to realize Merrick might be into something when a group of bloodsuckers, led by one Lothos (Rutger Hauer), decide to feast on the locals.To be perfectly honest, the movie isn't all bad at first (minus the introduction segment, which looks like it was taken from a cheesy adult film) any complaints about Buffy being a stupid girl are off the mark, since she is meant to be like that in the early stages of the story, and Sutherland adds some gravitas to an otherwise thankless role. Then, once the villains appear, the tonal confusion becomes all too obvious the scary moments play out as if the film was a spoof of horror movies, whilst the comedy looks like a poor man's version of John Hughes' body of work. In fact, the plot sort of vanishes after 20 minutes or so, leaving room for a succession of poorly planned, shoddily executed set-ups.The uneven tone shows up in the performances as well Sutherland and Luke Perry (clearly using his Beverly Hills 90210 image for the role of Buffy's sidekick Pike) take the assignment very seriously, although both are occasionally burdened with terrible lines (again, not likely to be coming from Whedon). Swanson sort of overplays the stupid side of the character, but manages to walk away rather unharmed (besides, comparisons with Sarah Michelle Gellar are a tad unfair, since the TV Buffy is a totally different person), whereas Hauer (assisted by Paul Reubens) relies too much on the villainous persona established in Blade Runner and The Hitcher to bother injecting some real life (ironic, given he's playing a walking corpse) into a toothless part (pun intended).With hindsight, it's easy to say 20th Century Fox and director Fran Rubel Kuzui (who later redeemed himself by producing the superior TV series) were wrong to think Whedon's original, darker take wouldn't have translated well on the screen. Nevertheless, even if the spin-off show had remained unproduced, it would still be clear that the movie is best remembered as a misdelivered blockbuster wannabe whose major charm is the presence of pre-fame Swank, David Arquette and a blink-and-you-miss Ben Affleck.

As a big fan of the Mario Bros. since the early '90's and a player of the classic games that came before my time, Would I consider myself a hardcore fan of the series? Why yes actually. Super Mario Bros. is not based directly from the games, but rather lives in the so called atmosphere of it. Also one must remember that it would not be wise to make a movie with a silent plumber hitting his head off bricks and jumping down green tubes and that sometimes artistic license is very necessary.The Mario Bros. are still their respective trades but live in Manhattan and are taken into the Mushroom Kingdom. Princess Peach is replaced by a true Brooklyn Woman named Danniella and Princess Daisy takes the Lead as the main female role. Also, Mushroom Kingdom is in fact another dimension. Some fans where very angry at the lack of Princess Peach who was replaced by the Original Princess Daisy and focused more on Luigi and his love interests or that Koopa is played by Denis Hopper But think back in the early 90's, it was a very expensive option to put in computer generated effects, especially once needed for someone like Bowser!The acting is not bad, although it is easy to tell that John Leguizamo was still a bit of greenhorn when it came to acting. Bob Hopkins is how I believe Mario would behave had he been a New Yorker, although he is a bit rough around the edges at first.

Its study of relationships, and one relationship in particular, manages to cover some pretty far-reaching ground and comes complete with a lot of different sorts of content; but the film always keeps its eye on how these instances, and the nature of the relationship, shape the persons engaging. If we are excited, we are to be excited at the film-making skills of a certain Roman Polanski and how he unfolds this narrative, and not at what these people go through in order to become the people we see on screen.In the broader sense of things, Bitter Moon is a really straight forward tale of two people meeting one other; getting to know one another and advancing things further and further to the point that they become sick of the sight of one other. But it is this premise stretched out to a time that most other directors would have a hard time keeping to in maintaining both audience interest and study. It is this premise that is actually used as a platform of greater things, something that allows a certain fascination in third parties initially unaware, but also gets across a certain sense of well-being. It feels as if Polanksi, through the characters of Nigel (Grant) and Fiona (Scott Thomas) whom have been happily married for so long, is trying to say that you should be thankful for what you've got and going bigger and better because your impulses demand you do, isn't always necessary.Power play seems to be a primary ingredient in Bitter Moon; in what is an interesting concoction of romance, tragedy, noir and some scenes of both sheer horror and terror. The film is narrated from the confines of a cruise ship in the Mediterranean, bound for Turkey, by an American paraplegic named Oscar (Coyote). Whatever beginnings of being in control of a situation or a person seems to stem from his conversations with Hugh Grant's Nigel. Over time, Nigel will become more and more intrigued by what it is Oscar has to say about a certain carefree dancer on the boat named Mimi (Seigner), who is linked to Oscar in more ways than is first apparent.But it isn't just this acquaintance as a relationship that Bitter Moon touches on, it breaks away from its primary strand of two people going through a love-fuelled grinder of friendship and fondness by providing us with enough material revolving around Nigel and Fiona's marriage which is threatened by the presence of Oscar and Mimi. It also looks at the notion of temptation, and a notion that one can become more and more intrigued about something as they spend time away from it, but hear, by way of word of mouth, as much as possible about said item. This is most apparent when Nigel spends more time with Oscar and hears of his deconstructing of Mimi as he delves into the past.Mimi and Oscar's relationship encompasses most things; from BDSM to urolagnia and right the on way through to the notion of knowing your once female lover, now full time carer, is in the room next door with another man; keeping you in a sort of cuckolded state of helplessness. But rather than demonise these interests, fetishes or notions; Bitter Moon gets across a state of wrong-doing, a sense that the repercussions of these activities when used despairingly can bring about ill-fated results, confusion and can form cracks within the relationship.If the audience are placed within the body of Nigel as this relatively clean-cut and seemingly perfectly innocent individual, then it is for the purpose of hearing Oscar's story unfold. About a quarter of the way through the piece, Mimi herself tells us, or Nigel, that Oscar is prone to making things up half the time anyway. Our minds are wary when we think back to an early chapter in their story when Oscar and Mimi bask in front of a glowing log fire whilst inhabiting an apartment in Paris, one that encompasses a perfect view of the Eiffel Tower as it stands there, not so far away in that you cannot see it, but not directly on it's front door step.That's not to say anything else Oscar says in untrue; in every sense of the term, we are sucked into his world; his world that he used to be the boss of; his world in which he was the writer, the creator and the would-be brains behind everything. His world, in which he would submit to the presence of Mimi purely to feed a curiosity and because he was able to, but would later find himself on the other foot when she submits to him; his world, in which ego driven positions of power were exploited and the phrase 'what goes around, comes around' didn't exist &#x96; not least, until now. The film is an interesting piece, an intimate character and scenario study unfolding within the intimate and closed in space of a boat and its cabins, just as the new year beckons and new chapters threaten to begin just as ominously as they threaten to end.
