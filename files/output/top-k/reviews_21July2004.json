But boy, oh boy, is it funny.The dialogue is so odd and unnatural that it becomes comical. Note the stagy way in which the detective's daughter talks.  `Welcome to hard times, DADDY', `I like it when you don't believe me DADDY.' Come on, playing a drug addict is easy &#150; just watch Courtney Love and imitate. Zoe doesn't sound drugged out but she must be because she always calls from a payphone where police sirens blast in the background.  And Zoe comes off well in comparison to the unintentionally hilarious stroke victim and the Otto's who put their heads together, dry-eyed and sniffle, expecting us to believe that they are crying over their long lost son named, Bear, of all things.Bravo to the generic and lifeless Sarah Polley who musters a tiny ounce of oomph to deliver `the big lie' at the end &#150; you know, the one she said she would NEVER tell.  She even attempts to glare at her father and later; if you look really close, it's the beginnings of a grin.How ridiculous is the scene where Ian Holm recounts a spider bite story that goes absolutely NOWHERE?  Why doesn't he remember Alison's father?  Why does he get stuck in a CAR WASH? What is wrong with this guy? And why is creepy Billy a saint for trying to convince Nicole's father not to sue?  This anti-sue-happy town sure is unrealistic.  Oh, they're Canadian.  Thank explains it.  Sure Ian Holm's acting is bad but does he really deserve the town's wrath for trying to gain a buck?There is a really cheesy time transition scene, which illustrates how confused director Atom Egoyan is. He thinks the audience needs to be hand held in order to comprehend the passing of time and yet he fails to explain anything else in this perplexing tale with similar clarity.Would people really behave the way these people do and what does it all mean anyway?  Detective Stephens says that our children are all lost to us.  The Pied Piper story echoes similar sentiments.  Some school kids are dead while others grow up to become drug addicts and are as good as gone.  One strange girl lives and because she tells a lie she is now, apparently, more pure than anyone else in town and well, that's it.It is always wise to heed the immortal words of Radiohead &#150; don't get sentimental, it always ends up drivel.

I loved this movie because it showed four people living life as it really is. The production team pegged those individual personalities with great accuracy! Every multi-dimensional character was portrayed effortlessly by each actor. Billy Bob did a great job with Lonnie Earl. He showed us his naturally snide demeanor, while still being able to convey his vulnerable sincerity in scenes with his wife, Darlene. Natasha portrays Darlene (who narrates the opening & closing scenes)with utmost grace. Oh, & the fact that she's English is totally hidden by a well sculpted southern accent. Her transformation was very beautifully reminiscent of a fairy tale, yet still astoundingly believable. Patrick shows us a very sensitive & sweet Roy, while still being a good southern boy mused by the monster truck jam & plenty of Pabst beer. He is everything a gentleman should be, and Patrick showed us how raw a man in his position can truly become. Honestly, I would love to have seen Darlene & Roy hook up, but in the end, I'm glad that what happened in Reno, stayed in Reno. Now, Charlize gave us a very interesting piece of eye-Candy ;) She once again proved that her acting is unsurmountable to any badly feux-pased script. Sure, Candy made a couple of bad decisions & seems a bit confused, but through all of the trips travesties, she pulls off an amazing comeout. Charlize managed to bring to life this very down to earth, redneck vixen with ease. She put so much emotion into her roles that she literally consumes them into herself. I've never seen heartbreak on any other actor's face the way I've seen it on hers. The realizations & character growth for each person i believe are all in great thanks to the actors who became those people. The storyline would have been sufferingly basic if it weren't for a cast of geniuses. While it did contain some clever dialogue, Waking Up In Reno was obviously carried by the greats who headline in this redneck love-comedy.
