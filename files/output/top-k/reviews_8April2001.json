[{"date":"8 April 2001","score":"","review":"  I wasn't even alive when this movie came out, but I had heard how incredibly horrible it was.  So I rented it.  Howard the Duck is a talking duck with arms that can't swim.  Howard is warped by some strange laser beam from planet Earth in HIS parellel dimension to ours.  Weird, huh?  It is there that he meets his friend Beverly. Howard is hilarious in the film and George Lucas makes him very realistic using his famous talent.  The film goes bad, though, when we find out that the scientist that beamed Howard to Earth is transforming into an evil Overlord from a strange planet.  It gets horrifyingly tacky after that.  I reccomend that you rent the movie and stop watching it before you get to the pathetic rubbish.  Even George Lucas cant save the ending, and, I'm sorry to say, the special effects at the end look like they came from a 1930's B-movie. Howards great, the movie's not!
