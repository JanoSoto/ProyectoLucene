When he orders a Russian mail order bride over the Internet, she duly self-delivers herself to the airport in the form of Nadia (Nicole Kidman). One of his main requirements in the arrangement was, Someone you can really talk to. I think communication is key. But as John drives her home, he realises that Nadia can't speak English &#x96; or seems not to.Although John at first desperately tries to contact the aptly named 'From Russia with Love' marriage agency to cancel the deal, the language barrier becomes far less important when he discovers that Nadia is sexually adventurous and encourages him to indulge his every fantasy with her.Everything seems to be going perfectly for John until Nadia's Russian cousin, Yuri (Mathieu Kassovitz), and his friend Alexei (Vincent Cassel) turn up and overwhelm his life. Effusively friendly at first, they soon prove disturbingly dangerous, and John realises that all is not as it seems.The plot heads into unpredictable territory and although the ending is pretty crazy it is also satisfying in light of all the revelations that take place along the way.The film has a lightness of touch, but also a dark side. If I could compare it with any other film it might be Jonathan Demme's Something Wild &#x96; the sexually aggressive girl, the nerdy guy, the slowly blossoming relationship and the intrusion of a psychotic and dangerous boyfriend. The basic ingredients work in both movies.Ben Chaplin hits just the right note as the colourless bank clerk who actually has a repressed wild side, he just needs the right person to unlock it and set it loose. His performance is both funny and engaging.Pretty, sexy, and slim almost to the point of fragility, Nicole Kidman's Nadia looks vulnerable, but as we discover as the story unfolds, looks are deceiving.

Al Stump in recent years has proved to be a liar and a forger so sports historians are calling into question a great deal of his supposed insight into Ty Cobb. In other words, in all likelihood Mr. Stump exaggerated or outright made up most of his allegations against Cobb to sell books. That isn't to say Ty Cobb was a prince of a human being because there's enough contemporary evidence to show that he wasn't. But some of the most vile things that have been said about him can be traced to Stump's writing. So take the things this movie has to say with a huge grain of salt. Another black mark against the film is that it has very little actual baseball in it. This movie doesn't care about Cobb the baseball giant. It only cares about Cobb the asshole. To include one side of the man without the other is a pointless exercise in self-righteousness. Why is a biography of Ty Cobb even necessary without his baseball accomplishments? Because he was a racist and a bully? There are millions of those, past and present, who aren't getting movies made about them. It just defies reason. Cobb was one of the greatest (and dirtiest) baseball players ever. Going by this movie, however, you would think he was just some crotchety old man who shared wacky adventures with a sports reporter. Tommy Lee Jones was too old to play this role, as is especially evident in the flashbacks to when Cobb was younger. He plays Cobb as a silly cantankerous cartoon of a man. Every bit as over the top as his performance of Two Face in Batman Forever. Let that sink in for a minute. Robert Wuhl plays himself as he always does. The movie is entertaining in spots. The comedic parts work better than the dramatic. I can't really recommend it because the bad outweighs the good and, personally, knowing about Stump leaves a bad taste in my mouth over the whole thing.

Because he was a racist and a bully? There are millions of those, past and present, who aren't getting movies made about them. It just defies reason. Cobb was one of the greatest (and dirtiest) baseball players ever. Going by this movie, however, you would think he was just some crotchety old man who shared wacky adventures with a sports reporter. Tommy Lee Jones was too old to play this role, as is especially evident in the flashbacks to when Cobb was younger. He plays Cobb as a silly cantankerous cartoon of a man. Every bit as over the top as his performance of Two Face in Batman Forever. Let that sink in for a minute. Robert Wuhl plays himself as he always does. The movie is entertaining in spots. The comedic parts work better than the dramatic. I can't really recommend it because the bad outweighs the good and, personally, knowing about Stump leaves a bad taste in my mouth over the whole thing.

Born on the Fourth of July is to show the brutality of war, and turn an over-patriotic pro-war American into realizing he has been wrong all along.Ron Kovic is the typical Cold War American kid loves the United States, hates Communism, and wants to fight the Commie Reds if he ever got the chance to. He grows up liking war as a kid. However, he knows for a fact that every time he seen American WW2 veterans marching down the street on July 4th that he wanted to be in the military. Finally, when the United States throws itself in Vietnam, Ron immediately wants to enlist. He leaves behind the girl he likes, friends, and family in place for the U.S. Marines. When he is sent over he can't wait for action. However, being a sergeant, Ron orders his squad to clear out a village the Marines just shot the crap out of. This involves him and his squad being ambushed and begin shooting back. They then find out that among the Vietnamese casualties they inflicted were civilians. Ron is surprised that he took part in killing innocent people, but then is ordered by his superiors to retreat as a Viet Cong advancement starts. When they back out of the town the battle becomes confusing, and when a fellow Marine steps out of the fog Ron shoots him, mistaking him for being a charging Viet Cong soldier. Ron then reports to the Lieutenant for what happened about killing civilians and friendly fire, but the Lt. says They got in the way. It's not your fault and You didn't shoot your own man, refusing to acknowledge.Later on patrol, Ron and other Marines are ambushed, and he gets paralysed in the spine and shot in the foot. Afterward he is sent to a battlefield hospital where he thinks he is going to die. He is then sent back to the United States to spend his time in a down-ridden and ugly hospital for Vietnam veterans. This is good that the producers exemplified this as it shows how the U.S. government poorly treated those who fought in the Vietnam War.Even though being told that he cannot walk again and through the injustices of war he experienced, Ron still holds true his patriotic views of the United States and Marines. A lot of the times he begins to feel how the government is essentially treating them in the poor hospital conditions and uses the War as a way to get attention. Pretty much he says stuff like I deserve better because I fought for my country, I'm a Vietnam Vet. Now, of course Vietnam Vets deserved to be treated better, but Ron still doesn't ridicule the War or government. He uses it as a way to seem like a hero, just the WW2 veterans he seen as a kid.He returns home hoping to be seen as a hero to everyone. Ron sees how the U.S. has changed anti-war riots and people burning flags and vowing for peace. Nothing about kill the Commies, or trump on Vietnam and defeat the Soviets. Ron also finds out that his brother has become an anti-war person and shows strong resentment for. As well, Ron sees the effect of the war on how life was before having his legs and not being paralysed. He also sees how different the people receive him as a hero on Independence Day by yelling anti-war slogans. After having a fight with a WW2 vet who shown no sympathy for saying Shove your Vietnam war up your a-- (because Ron tried sound patriotic because he took part in a war) he gets into a fight with his family by confessing he killed innocent people, and defying the religious values he was taught as a kid.Ron decides to go to a Mexican village where many other Vietnam Vets have gone to relax. He meets up with a fellow Vet in a wheelchair and both decide the Mexican village has no worth for them and want to travel some place else, but get stranded and fight against each other. However, they hitch a ride with a truck driver who drives them back to the same village they came from. After this Ron goes to Georgia and stops by the Marine's family's house who he killed in Vietnam. Ron explains to the family and widow that it was a confusing time in the battle and did not truly mean to kill Wilson, the Marine's name. Wilson's parents forgive him, especially the father who was a WW2 veteran and understands the confusing time of war. But, Wilson's wife says she can't forgive him, but hopes God can.From there, Ron goes to Florida to protest with the Vietnam Vets Against the War (VVAW). He tells the fellow veterans his story and why he now hates the government and the war, but not his country. Republican supporters try to silence Ron and the VVAW for their anti-war slogans, even if they haven't gone to war but the people in the VVAW have and know what they are talking about. After being kicked out, Ron writes a book named Born on the Fourth of July, and the movie ends with him speaking to crowd about how the Vietnam War was wrong, mirroring how earlier as a child his mother said I see you speaking to a large group of people saying great things. This movie is absolutely good, and shows how ridiculous it is to support war, or a country who doesn't care about those who were physically or mentally wounded from it. Ron went from a pro-war American who thought like it or leave it to resenting the American government for its pro-war agenda to supposedly fight Communism without caring much for the actual young men who are sent to fight the wars.

Along with the Expressionist influence on his movies and certain bases created within the walls of Hollywood system, the director's highly sophisticated, unique style pursued within a span of a few decades but, foremost, his frankness towards viewers made Hitchcock stand a test of time. And with his sardonic, mischievous wit and the magnetism of his casts (Carter B. Horsley), including Ernest Lehmann's witty and clever script, NORTH BY NORTHWEST appears to be Hitchcosk's milestone and perhaps his most fully realized film. (Charles Ramirez Berg). All seems to be around an old Hollywood saying boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl after all. And although this saying appears to find its resemblance within the themes of many movies, when supplied with Hitch's suspense, it results in stupendous achievement and a highly satisfactory entertainment.To start with, it appears that most of the movie's charm and strength lies in the lead performance by Cary Grant as a man on Lincoln's nose, likable Roger Thornhill. Unlike James Stewart, Cary Grant, the prototype of the ideal man and a man-bridge of generations at the turn of periods, supplies us with the most crucial aspects of good performance. He is wonderfully witty, outstandingly skilled, almost an athlete on the screen, a perfect leading man as well as the actor capable of bringing about the very best thrills and putting emotional resonance into the story. His performance is so powerful that we, as viewers, simply skip certain flaws in the story. He is never too much overwhelmed by the role, never too easily taken with emotions and by that his role remains one of the most authentic achievements on the screen. Being his fourth role under the direction of Alfred Hitchcock, he proves excellent rapport with the Master of Suspense. The director's sense of humor goes perfectly well with Grant's comic skills, the director's style goes well with Grant's mystique, the director's psychological overtones and hidden meanings go beautifully with the actor's subtle, transcending acting abilities. The best moments include the drunkard's driving (which B Horsley rightly labels as pure buffoonery) and the art auction, a typical Hitch-like scene of a public event interrupted. No wonder Pauline Kael once pointed out that Grant appeared before us in his radiantly shallow perfection and that is all we wanted of him. FEMALE CO-STARS Hitchock's preferences of beautiful blonds on the screen does not meet any exception in NORTH BY NORTHWEST. It is no Grace Kelly or Ingrid Bergman, but an actress who can perfectly stand a chance against lots of expectations and requirements of the more demanding audiences, Eva Marie Saint as a 26 year-old Eve Kendall. She manages to give a performance that initiates a true clash of senses radiantly awesome whilst being a stranger on a train so much taken with the man's face, stunningly captivating whilst being a spy within a more organized institutionalized group, undeniably sexy capable of bringing all erotic thoughts to life whilst being totally dressed. The best moments include the train sequence, in my opinion. That sequence brings all to heights of witty intelligence and a great touch of climbing up and proving to him why she has been so good to the man. The two (Eva Marie Saint and Cary Grant) appear to embody contrast themselves, contradiction of loneliness vs togetherness. Boy gets girl after all and loneliness happily leads to togetherness...Among the supporting cast, each viewer will surely be stunned by the performance of James Mason, deliciously pernicious with cool elegance and authority (B. Horsley) drawing parallels to James Bond's villains. His scenes are ostentatiously cold and innately captivating. The theme of a mummy's boy is developed by Jessie Royce Landis who plays the protagonist's mother in some hilarious moments. Martin Landau is also interesting in his early role as Leonard.Amidst the merits of the movie, two points need a special mention excellent shots that Alfred Hitchcock was famous for and the score by Bernard Herrman. It's no need to say how beautifully the tunes correspond to the action, the whole storytelling, how balanced the score is and how strongly it teases our imagination, our assumptions, gently caressing our senses.

With big gadgets and a plot that some may find straight forward but I found it to be well put together at most points, you shouldn't be bored by this second Bond film by Brosnan. Overall I felt it was firmly an OK movie, and here below is why I felt that about it.The story as said is a good plot, works well with a villain trying to create news stories for his own financial benefit, Bond in the story works his way adventurously thorough different countries and even the bottom of the sea at one point. It can be fast at parts then suddenly speed up and the story isn't done so well it deserves a medal, but OK entertainment nonetheless. I felt the end slows slightly and affects it but otherwise it is worth a watch and I feel some may really like this.Pierce Brosnan is back as Bond and he is good, he isn't the one who affects the film and he brings all the elements he had in Goldeneye back for this one too. He brings a Bond full of surprises and delivers some of the best quips of all time. Jonathan Pryce as the villain is well, not so evil looking but still his mind is completely crazy and he becomes one of those Bond villains who is able to mix insanity with a bit of humour too. Michelle Yeoh as the Bond girl is OK but maybe she lacks the certain things that some of the other girls can bring to the series.It is not written or directed particularly well but it isn't of care as you feel Brosnan controls the scenes and even if the dialogue is a little stingy, Brosnan does at times manage to save the film from utter repute. I like the gadgets, they are fun and what we expect from Bond, over the top as hell but still they are fun to see and without some of the gadgets used in this movie, we would be without some key and great action scenes.The film lacks a true substance, that is the main criticism here as the premise is not a bad one but the people behind this movie really fail to bring a good story out and a Bond who has met his match, it isn't good enough simple. You could also say this over uses action, if you look back after watching you kind of think about the constant explosions and when using his gadgets, the kind of useless action that isn't rationally needed.Bond series fans should enjoy it as it brings what Bond is again, some may dislike the constant action and even the more darker tones, but it shouldn't bother too much. For anyone looking for a humorous Bond, this isn't it as although Pryce is funny at times and Brosnan delivers some good lines in the line of comedy, there isn't enough and as said, overall it takes on a much more darker tone than say Roger Moore's portrayal of James Bond.Overall I give this a 6\/10, it is Firmly an OK movie, I felt like being nice here, I could have said this lacks everything but watching it you can't help feel that Brosnan tries hard here and manages a good job out of it. Probably not the best of Brosnans acts of Bond but worth a good watch, if your watching all the Bonds in order, this one may let you down after Goldeneye, as a one off, best if those who enjoy much more action in a film see this one as it is jam packed with it all, guns are firing everywhere.

He brings a Bond full of surprises and delivers some of the best quips of all time.

Of course, the Marne refers to the Western front, and the Piave refers to the Italian, wherein lies this movie's focus. A Farewell to Arms is based upon the semi-autobiographical novel of Ernest Hemingway's experiences when he served as an ambulance driver for the Italians who fought the Austrians and Hungarians in World War I. In the opening sequence we see a dead soldier draped with the Alpine background. Then we observe several Italian ambulances moving along the winding mountains away from the battlefield. Our hero Lt. (Tenente in Italian) Frederic Henry (Gary Cooper) casually reports to Headquarters just as young and attractive English nurse Molly is being rebuked and dismissed for getting pregnant. She had fallen in love with a soldier; Disgracing the uniform we all wear, proclaims the head nurse. Regulations are regulations.Lt. Henry is good friends with Major Rinaldi (Adolphe Menjou), who is also a surgeon. The two men drink and visit brothels together. Rinaldi happens to like English Nurse Catherine Barkley (Helen Hayes), but early on, after she is introduced to Henry, she and the young lieutenant are greatly attracted to each other. They become lovers right away and just before Henry has to return to the front. Meanwhile Rinaldi uses his influence to have Barkley transferred to Milan. Just before the shelling begins on the battlefront, we see the Italian soldiers eating their rations of bread, cheese, and pasta . . . and even wine. While the men are eating an Austrian shell scores a direct hit, wounding Henry in the right knee and foot. Henry is removed to the military hospital in Milan where Barkley is stationed. Their love affair resumes, but because the Italian Chaplain (Jack La Rue) knows that they are not married, he conducts a proxy marriage (not in the book, however). Later the hospital head nurse, after catching Henry with his hidden liquor bottles under the mattress, reports him to authorities who deem him healthy enough to revisit the front. While Henry is thus away, Rinaldi, who has censorship authority, censures the letters of both Barkley and Henry because he feels that it is wrong for the lieutenant to lose his head over a woman. The soldier and the nurse lose contact.Meanwhile a great Austrian and German offensive has succeeded in breaking through the Italian defensive line at Caporetto (October 1917), and the Italians are in retreat. They are constantly blasted with bombs and raked with aerial machine gun fire. Displeased with the Italian high command (perhaps not without reason), Frederic Henry deserts the army. His main goal is to link up with Catherine somehow. He meets up with Catherine's best friend, Nurse Helen Ferguson (Mary Philips) and is genuinely surprised when she unenthusiastically tells him that Catherine is pregnant. But Frederic still does not know where she is located. And the Italian police (carabinieri) are still searching for him. Events are fast-forwarded because a newspaper headline reads, Italian Armies Successful in Great Piave Offensive. (This event occurred in June 1918.)Eventually Henry meets up with Major Rinaldi, who relents and shows compassion when Henry tells him that Catherine is with child. He gives Henry Catherine's location (Brissago, Switzerland) and cash to help him. Time is fast-forwarded to November 1918, as a newspaper headline now reads, L'Austria Capitola (Austria Capitulates). Now the scene inter-cuts with Catherine's most difficult childbirth event in the Swiss hospital. Her baby boy is stillborn, and her health is failing. Soaked with rain Frederic arrives in the hospital in time to share some words with Catherine. Their last moments are tender ones. He lifts her dead body as doves fly and the church bells ring, proclaiming that the Armistice has ended the Great War. Peace, Frederic utters.Hemingway's novel actually ends during the middle of 1918, at the height of the great German offensives on the Western front. And in the novel Frederic Henry dejectedly leaves the Swiss hospital and walks out into the rain. All in all, the movie is a very successful tearjerker, and is better than the 1957 version, although the latter's cinematography is at a high level, and even though Cooper is over a foot taller than the diminutive Hayes. Director Frank Borzage, who began filming in 1913, was the first person in Hollywood history to win the Academy Award for Best Picture (Seventh Heaven, 1929). He won again in 1931 for Bad Girl. Borzage's version of A Farewell to Arms belongs among the top 15 or 20 movies of 1932 even though his adaptation is loose. His well-known trademark was in identifying the feelings of young lovers in the face of intense trial, as in wartime. His montages here, like the retreat from Caporetto and Henry's twenty mile-trek to Switzerland through storms, are both expertly done. Charles Lang won the Academy Award for Cinematography. The acting is fine all the way around although Hayes sometimes overacts. Both Adolphe Menjou and Jack La Rue, who have French surnames, do very well acting as Italians. Menjou as Rinaldi is the worldly one; La Rue as the priest prays for the end of suffering and war's end. Gary Cooper was destined to win the Academy Award for Best Actor twice Sergeant York (1940) and High Noon (1952).(PS I also reviewed the 1957 version of A Farewell to Arms for IMDb on 2 April 2014.)

Menjou as Rinaldi is the worldly one; La Rue as the priest prays for the end of suffering and war's end. Gary Cooper was destined to win the Academy Award for Best Actor twice Sergeant York (1940) and High Noon (1952).(PS I also reviewed the 1957 version of A Farewell to Arms for IMDb on 2 April 2014.)

If I had to rank them according to quality, as objective as subjective character, there would be a very big problem, almost impossible one. But perhaps of all these movies this one can be especially highlighted and placed in pole position. It is, as you can see, a film-noir Double Indemnity (Double Indemnity). Although I love Bogart and Maltese Falcon, perhaps my favorite noir, I have to admit that this is definitely above par, if not a little better but The Maltese Falcon built in favor because it was one of if not the first big representative of this genre. Double Indemnity is recorded based on the novel by James M. Cain and the story is based, as was later discovered, on a true story, Snyder-Gray case, in which they recorded and later film The Postman Always Rings Twice and Body Heat. The film scenario was written by famous Raymond Chandler best known for his screenplays for The Big Sleep, Strangers on a Train, Murder, My Sweet and The Long Goodbye, which is incidentally a kind of remake of The Big Sleep.Chandler is in the film and has a cameo appearance and this is his only appearance on the big screen ever recorded. The film follows protagonist Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) who specializes in selling insurance and thus meets the fatal Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) who hints that he wants the death of his wife. Since Walter works in direct contact with the insurance they begin to forge a perfect plan, the plan flawlessly. In addition to these two actors phenomenal there is still a great Edward G. Robinson in the equally essential role. Double Indemnity is a film that you will see in a single breath, a film in which absolutely everything works perfectly without any slowdown and loss of pace, he's doing what the viewer rare that a film can - keeps it continually in suspense until this, fascinated and intoxicated by its quality keeps nailed with a chair experiencing an adventure for adventure. The film offers us to enter into it, become part of the attending and feel just like the characters, as if somewhere next to them watching. Although starting Politics and operates retrospectively striking a note of some stuff he still works perfectly. About Noir elements do not need to waste words, because it is indeed a wonderful staff, impressive games of light and shadow and the characterization of the characters, which is one of the strongest assets of this epochal achievement. I think it is now almost impossible to make a movie like this or try remake same as it would not go near this quality. Almost dare to say that this film does not have a flaw and that is the definition of perfection. It is interesting that many actors refused the role of Walter, but many are also badly wanted to he went to MacMurray in whose place here do not even dare to imagine any other reason that is perfectly acted and did not know how not earned an Oscar nomination. The film was nominated for seven or Oscars and did not win a single which is considered one of the greatest injustices ever speaking of the Oscars. But later, Wilder received his Oscar for The Lost Weekend, which was even then earned four prestigious awards, which is justice, we can say, is met. Double Indemnity is mandatory reading for all film lovers to be as soon as possible to look if it has not already done so far.

I saw it when it came out, and i was entirely too young to appreciate it (i was about 9 when it came out). The movie over all holds up and it good but there are few things i don't care for. Visually, even 17 years later, the movie is a masterpiece. Sets, costume, cgi, all of it is a impressive as it was when it first came out. The first half of the movie is slow and plodding, which everyone complains about, but this is a love story, not a disaster movie, so I personally think those people need to readjust their expectations and watch this again. My big problem is the 2 leads. DiCaprio and Winslet are OK. But thats honestly about it. Lines are delivered (I feel) either flatly or are over acted. I see them falling in love and honestly it doesn't grab me. And that's not because I'm a guy, I love a good romance. Something about their chemistry just doesn't seem as genuine as i was expecting. Some of the lines at the end are painfully corny, especially DiCaprio's telling Winslet that she is going to make lots of babies.... Seriously? That could have been beautiful, it's the gut wrenching end to a Romeo and Juliet love story, but I feel like that whole scene was written by an 8 year old. Kathy Bates, as always, I liked, and Billy Zane gets my vote for Best Scumbag in a Movie Ever. I do like that Cameron make Winslet Transform as so many of his characters do (Sarah Connor and Ripley start out powerless and end up tearing the movie apart, and in much the same way Winslet starts as a trapped helpless woman, and ends the movie by taking an ax to doors and saving the lead male). That is done VERY well. I'm still giving this 8 stars because even though this may have snags that I don\/t care for, the over all story and the setting are very very strong. The pathos of the passengers drowning or trying to save their children had a knot in my stomach and most of the characters are great, even if the 2 leads are only good.
