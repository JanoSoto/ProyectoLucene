Set in early 19th century England, it details the coming of age story of Maurice Hall, an upper-class aristocrat who falls in love with fellow classmate Clive Durham (Hugh Grant). Shortly after their romance begins, a fellow student is entrapped and imprisoned for soliciting a military officer. Out of fear of losing his inheritance and political future, Clive decides to get married. Although hurt and feeling very alone, Maurice continues a close platonic relationship with Clive. After attempts to cure his homosexuality fail, Maurice finds himself falling in love with Clive's gamekeeper, Scudder. With the threat of exposure and blackmail always a real possibility, they must risk everything to build a future together. Supporting performances by Denholm Elliot, Helena Bonham Carter and Ben Kingsley help make this a true classic.

There are sequences in this film that are perfect - absolutely flawless - and always very very funny (Max emerging from that elevator in slow-motion, that shot will stay with me forever). The young actor who plays the lead is mesmerizing. All of the supporting cast is solid, including Olivia Williams who really shines here (unlike what she was asked to do in Costner's The Postman), but the most amazing and wonderful performer in the movie is Bill Murray.  It is the most subtle characterization he has ever done on screen and it is absolutely flawless. Every pause, every facial expression, every line he delivers is golden.  I have always been a huge Murray fan, but this is easily his most inspired and original performance. Rushmore is hauntingly funny it will stay with you for a long time.

That is why I would recommend it any time. The plot is a bit unbelievable and I find the editing\/directing style annoying but instead you will find excellent performances from Sean Penn, Jennifer Lopez, Nick Nolte and especially Billy Bob Thornton. He is nothing short of scary as the local hillbilly automechanic. If you also consider the interesting and funny dialogue you have a very solid movie. As Sean Penn's character says to Billy Bob Thornton's 30.000 people die every day - why aren't you among them I say Hundreds of movies come out of Hollywood every year - why are only a handful of them like U Turn. Rating 7 of 10. ","genre":null},{"date":"12 October 1998","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  U Turn is anything but the usual Hollywood movie.
