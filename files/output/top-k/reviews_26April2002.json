I just can't say that a romantic comedy starring Chris O'Donnell held any appeal for me, and to be perfectly honest, I can't even remember why I decided to watch it. Whatever led me to watch this film, I'm glad, because it was surprisingly amusing. There are certain reasons for watching a romantic comedy, and not all of them have to do with going out on your second date with your high school boyfriend or girlfriend. A good romantic comedy will have a quality romance element that will keep the female audience adequately interested, as well as enough good comedy to keep the attention of those guys who just can't get into the romance even a little bit (oh, shut up, you know you had tears in your eyes). The Wedding Singer is a perfect example of a romantic comedy that fills these requirements in just the right proportions. In the case of The Bachelor, you don't have to be scared away just because Chris O'Donnell belongs in a romantic comedy only slightly more than someone like Jet Li or Steven Seagal does.There is an amusing plot that involves massive amounts of money that will be awarded to Jimmy Shannon (O'Donnell) if he married by his 30th birthday, which is inconveniently the next day. Now, as there are good things that a romantic comedy should strive for, such as all those described above, there are also horribly frustrating things that are unfortunately common in these films. To describe a couple of them stereotypically, there is the aggravatingly stubborn girlfriend, and the boyfriend who turns into a complete moron at just the right (or wrong) times. Jimmy's girlfriend, Anne (Renee Zellweger), knows that Jimmy doesn't want to get married, and therefore makes a big fuss when he wants to get married because of this money. For crying out loud, it's a HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS!! CONVINCE HIM LATER!!! You'd think that she would at least keep the prenuptial agreement in mind before turning him down for being shallow. If anything, she should smack him if he's still hesitant to marry after being promised all this money (in, by the way, an absolutely hilarious video will).But of course, we can't blame everything on the girl, right? Of course not. Jimmy has the unenviable skill of invariably sticking his foot so far in his mouth at just the wrong moment that he'll have to have it surgically removed. He screws up proposal after proposal in the most idiotic ways, challenging the audience to keep from screaming out how stupid it is to daydream about horses on the helipad as he's proposing to Anne (as they say, if you love your freedom, your marriage will fail), or to tell Zoe how far down on the list she is. Thankfully, however, frustrating nonsense like this, although sadly prevalent in the film, is satisfactorily countered by side-splitting comedy, a lot of which is embodied in the grumpy old grandfather with the loudspeaker (`PROCREATE!!'). Other than the bonehead proposals that Jimmy gives to his ex-girlfriends, that part of the film was actually pretty well structured. The only one of them who actually agrees to marry him is pretty good looking but is also a greedy bi*ch. And, as if that weren't bad enough, her name's BUCKley. I don't care how good looking you are, Buckley is the name of a redneck boy. On the other hand, at least she was honest that she was only interested in the marriage as a business arrangement.(spoilers) So as we near the end of the film, it becomes time for the happy ending to develop, so marriage is suddenly made to be a good thing. I think that this is true myself (both of my parents are divorced, but are also each happily re-married), but the institution of marriage is clearly manipulated in this movie in order to further the plot in just the right way. Manipulative, yes, but also not necessarily excessive or even bad. We eventually encounter a happily married priest who calls marriage the best thing that ever happened to him, and this is basically what changes Jimmy's mind about the whole thing, which only leaves the task of finding Anne and getting her to believe that he really wants to marry her and to get the ceremony done in time to get the money promised in his grandfather's hilarious video will. Her train arrives at 550, and he has to be married by 605. Trains are ALWAYS late, but we'll ignore that for now. This is, of course, the time when he wakes up in church and gets mobbed by eager brides, who all begin spouting criteria at him for some mysterious reason, and then get mad at him for his preferences. He says that he likes blondes, and is ACCUSED by brunettes left and right for it. He should have said, `No bi*ches.'There are some serious logical discrepancies in the final scene, such as the Where's Waldo-like scene of the brides mobbing the police car but parting calmly for Anne to pass through, as well as the fact that they all quiet down immediately when Anne's sister tells them to. There is a cheesy cutesy scene when Anne asks if this can please be her day, the crowd of angry brides mysteriously applauds when they are pronounced man and wife, and then the fat guy announces `Cake for everybody!' which leaves us to wonder how they are to provide cake for everyone in that crowd when the cakes cost $800 each. Obviously not perfect, but as a whole, the film is entertaining and amusing, despite a lot of cheesy garbage, and it can be enjoyed for that. It didn't start out with a lot of promise, but I think that the movie came through.

Hard core.What we do expect fine young females showing some titties, having sex and drinking beer. We expect to see some hard core murder performed in unique and interesting ways. We want buckets of blood as Jason fulfills his roll as an unstoppable killing machine.

It has an interesting beginning and finish, but the middle is frustratingly awkward and dull.The best thing about the film is its premise and its impressive visual style. The weakest aspects of the films are its weak characterizations and acting, its phony late 1980's setting and overall bad scenes. It's kind of a riff on the play and Jimmy Stewart film HARVEY, about a man who has a rabbit friend he calls Harvey who of course is just a product of his imagination. HARVEY, however, is a comedy -- a good comedy at that. This film on the other hand, like an insecure teenager, takes itself way too seriously.What really bugged me the most about this film was how horrible and unconvincing the high school setting was. I went to high school in the 80's, and this school in this film did not resemble any American high school that I have ever seen or heard of. This was supposed to be a private school? This had to be the single dumbest and most pathetic group of privileged white upper class students ever portrayed on film. These kids (especially the boys) would barely make it, academically, at Inglewood High much less at a privileged academy. At first, I thought it was supposed to be a reform school or military academy because all of the boys at the school were such violent-prone waste case losers. But with all the intelligent, well-behaved girls at the school you realize that it supposed to be some bogus co-ed private school. The teachers at the school are even less credible than the students. Drew Barrymore gives the absolutely worst performance of her career as a self-absorbed English teacher. She also has one of the stupidest lines in movie history; when a new female student asks where she should sit, Barrymore utters, why don't you sit next to the cutest boy in the class. My friends and I were openly making fun of the film at this point. Also, inexplicably, Noah Wyle agreed to take a part in this film at the nice guy teacher. Bad move. A furniture polish commercial would have made a better career choice. Then there is Patrick Swayze's character a millionaire motivational speaker who seems to have nothing better to do than to hang around this Stepford Wives setting of numbed out teenagers. How did this man get so wealthy and influential? He's not convincing to anyone at all. The director wants us to believe Donnie Dorko is somehow enlightened, intelligent and well adjusted, when he openly insults Swayze's character at a high school assembly. Unfortunately, the only way the director can relate Donnie's intelligence and insight is by making all of the other characters in the film out to be complete idiots. Even Donnie's Harvard bound sister seems instead like she should be bound for Sacramento State University. Then there are Donnie's parents who are Republicans, but not disciplinarians. Of course Donnie would have emotional problems, because everyone else in Donnie's hometown is a figment of detached movie reality.One scene that represented everything wrong with this film was the obligatory 80's culture discussion, which in this film is a discussion about the role of Smurfette in the community of the Smurfs. The discussion had no place in the film except that it served to make Donnie seem insightful, when in fact many kids in the 80's (or any other time) seemed to have much wittier and interesting discussions than in this film.  No one in this film says anything funny or clever -- ever. There is no wit, no teenage recklessness or unabashed nuttiness. There is just Donnie and the community he comes from, in which everyone is dumbed down to make Donnie seem interesting.What did I like about this film? I suppose I liked the bunny, the jet engine thing and the twist at the end. But I don't care to piece puzzle films like this back together. I'm not interested in what a film like this meant or what happened because a film like this is too pretentious to have any meaning or depth. Ultimately, what matters to me is whether I enjoyed the film while it was playing before my eyes. And in the case of this film, the answer is no. There were too many scenes with no real tension or suspense and there were too many scenes that didn't need to belong in this film but were simply there to try to indicate that the film took place in the 1980's. By the way, I couldn't think of a single good reason this film needed to be set in the 80's. In fact, it would have worked much better if it were set in the present day, and it would have worked much better if the audience didn't know ahead of time that the film was counting down to Halloween.Then there is Donnie himself, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, who unfortunately resembles a creepy, morose, dark haired version of Seth Green. I kept waiting for Dr. Evil to pop out of the bunny suit and say shhh. Gyllenhaal is decent in the role, but he doesn't have much to work with except when the bunny is also on screen. Also, when he has visions, the visions are the most uninteresting creations of CGI effects. In other words, Donnie has visions of special effects.On top of there is a whole time warp, portal dimension plot that belongs in another film. Then there is the mental illness aspect that seems to be the focus of the film and then suddenly disappears. There are simply too many movies, too much going on in this film -- more than this director has the talent and capability to handle. He needs to go back to film school take a course on Italian neo-realism. However, he does have talent as a director. He probably simply needs to grow up a bit and live life some more. There are some images in this film that are very striking. Strangely, the image that caught my eye the most was the image of the chandelier trembling over the stairway after the jet engine falls on the house. This was a very striking image -- perhaps because it contained what much of the rest of the film lacked simplicity, tension and a feeling of strong emotion.

Instead, what I got was a painfully mediocre movie with absolutely nothing new to offer. This movie is nothing more than a recycled story line from every other movie in its genre, and it fails to offer anything substantially different from any of them.Meet Jim Morris (Dennis Quaid), a high school teacher\/baseball coach who once had a dream of being in the major leagues. However, somewhere down the line, he got an arm injury and settled for a small town family life instead. One day, he shocks his high school baseball team by throwing a pitch that clocks in at 98 MPH. The kids then launch into a motivational speech, somewhere along the cliche lines of you always encourage us to chase our dreams, but you're not following your own! Bewildered by this shocking revelation, Morris decides to try out for pro baseball, if, and only if, the high school team gets into the district championship. Hmmm, I wonder what happens...My biggest fault with this movie (besides the fact that you know the entire story solely from the 1 minute trailer), is that it expects you to sympathize with the characters and feel what they're feeling, but it never takes the steps needed to form those connections. His few scenes with his wife are brief and distant, not showing us any real bond or chemistry between the two characters. The only one of his kids we somewhat get to know is his adoring 8-year-old son, who idolizes his dad's infatuation with baseball and wants to be just like him. Beyond that, we see no real connections between Morris and his family. They are simply props in the background while he chases his dreams.I would rate this movie a very generous 6\/10. While it was not a terrible movie, it was certainly not ground breaking or impressive all the same.

I left the theater with the thought firm in my mind that no other actor could have possibly taken the role from Ford than Affleck.  He was, in a word, phenomenal.  And the movie and supporting cast performances surrounding him were nothing to scoff at either.  Although the format of the film still had some minor corrections to be made (as it was in prerelease format) it was a film I would recommend to everyone, Jack Ryan fan or not.The flaws I speak of in this movie are within the story itself and its consistency with the previous films in the Jack Ryan series.  The film places Affleck's character as a CIA analyst without a family to speak of. In the previous films, Ryan's family is not only present, but fundamental to Patriot Games.  At first I summed this up to be a prequel to the other movies, which would make sense - Ryan is younger, he has yet to achieve his place in the CIA, he has yet to marry and build a family.  Soon into the movie, however, we find that the date is current - 2002, which obviously does not concur with the rest of the films. This is a very minor point, but it bugged me throughout watching the film. Because of the minority of this flaw, and the fact that in the movie itself this has no relevance, I give it a perfect 5\/5.

This is a very minor point, but it bugged me throughout watching the film. Because of the minority of this flaw, and the fact that in the movie itself this has no relevance, I give it a perfect 5\/5.

As a devout fan of the original three Jack Ryan films, as well as the Clancy books, I was worried that this movie would turn the franchise into one boasting of celeb status instead of quality suspense drama.But by the end of the movie, I was absolutely awed.  I left the theater with the thought firm in my mind that no other actor could have possibly taken the role from Ford than Affleck.  He was, in a word, phenomenal.  And the movie and supporting cast performances surrounding him were nothing to scoff at either.  Although the format of the film still had some minor corrections to be made (as it was in prerelease format) it was a film I would recommend to everyone, Jack Ryan fan or not.The flaws I speak of in this movie are within the story itself and its consistency with the previous films in the Jack Ryan series.  The film places Affleck's character as a CIA analyst without a family to speak of. In the previous films, Ryan's family is not only present, but fundamental to Patriot Games.

This is a different story about Dorothy and OZ that is actually more faithful to the series of L. Frank Baum books than the Judy Garland film was. Tik-Tok, Jack Pumpkinhead, Mombi, the gnome king, and the wheelers were as much a part of the original stories (published in the very early 1900's) as the scarecrow and tin man were.   I understand why some people don't like the movie as I didn't the first time I saw it. No film that trashes emerald city and has Dorothy recieving shock treatment is going to make fans of the first film very happy.However on my second veiwing years later it was nice to get an idea of the much darker vision that the author of the books had created. He created an OZ that had a very scary side to it, but ultimately good would always triumph. Although this isn't a film for kids under 8 years of age, I believe most kids would probably like it. I do think the special effects could have been a little better, as this was made in 1985. And I wish that they would have had Dorothy interact more with the scarecrow, lion and tin man.If you only want to see more of the first film then I wouldn't recommend this, otherwise enjoy.

Since some people don't seem to understand this drift of thought, I'll try to give my two-cents worth of interpretation. There is a certain kind of gay male sensibility that loves the kind of over the top humor that predominates in Baby Jane. I never thought of this movie as a horror movie, though it could fit the genre. But, really now, horror depends on a certain level of credible realism, as in Psycho and all of Hitchcock's films. That's why it is scary. Even modern horror films with monsters, UFOs, etc, rest on the premise that these are real phenomena and the movies ask us to suspend our disbelief within the context of the movie.Baby Jane is completely different, and that is why it is campy and humorous. Elegantly serving your invalid sister a rat for dinner is just too much! Over the top. Unbelievable. Outrageous. Histrionic. Bette's makeup, ditto. Joan's completely loving and devoted manner, ditto. In other words, in spite of its literal horror aspects, Baby Jane--in its details--is too ridiculous to believe. Only a demented sicko (Bette's character) could possibly come up with these ideas, and only an equally demented and deluded sister (Jane's role) could find Bette in any way lovable or redeemable. Both roles are such exaggerations, such extremes, that they are funny, hilarious in fact. Even the sadistic treatment by Bette of longsuffering Joan is absurdly out of kilter. One can only laugh at the histrionics.Of course, so much of the camp aspect of the movie depends on our previous knowledge of both these famous actresses. Especially important, is the long history of venomous lines uttered by Hollywood's most superbly bitchy star, Mme Davis. All About Eve, of course, is the locus classicus for Bette's campy, dishy humor. It is another gay classic, one described elsewhere on the IMDB as every drag queen's favorite movie.Baby Jane is definitely a 10 out of 10.
