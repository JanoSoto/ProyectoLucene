I honestly don't think I'd be who I am today with out it. I don't understand why so many people don't like it. The animation's beautiful, the songs are to die for, and the story is great. Yes, it doesn't follow the true story, but that wouldn't really make a good kid's movie, would it? It's a Disney movie, people. Disney. And I fail to see how it is racist, either. If anything, it is the complete embodiment of anti-racism.The story is about European exploration and relations with the Natives in America during the 1600s. We watch as the heroic Captain John Smith travels on a ship with the greedy Governor Ratcliffe across the fierce Atlantic waves to the Virginian Coast, where they set up camp in search of gold. Not to far away is a Native village, where we meet Pocahontas and her friends and family. At some point later, John and Pocahontas meet by a waterfall. Taken by surprise, John crouches low, and prepares to shoot the princess, but stops after she looks at him very majestically and commandingly (not in a mean way, just like you will not hurt me). This starts an unsuspecting romance between the two, and eventually causes the Natives and the Europeans to clash, because each think the other are savages. Pocahontas, with the help of Grandmother Willow, realizes that fighting must stop and she must follow her heart. She teaches John this through the beautiful and moving song Colors of the Wind, my personal favorite Disney song of all time. A terrific battle scene ensues, accompanied by Drums of War. I won't give away any more.But does this really sound racist to you? This movie is about stopping racism and prejudice, how love can overcome any obstacle. HOW THE HECK IS THAT RACIST?????? People are also saying it's an overdone storyline, but the only movie I can think of right now that has the same basis would be Last of the Mohicans, which is hardly a children's film. And, anyway, doesn't everything get a little repetitive these days? I've also read some things that say this movie is sexist. Because Pocahontas apparently throws herself and John or something. So basically, wouldn't every other princess movie (with the exception of Beauty and the Beast or maybe Aladdin) be the same way? Don't all of the princesses pretty much throw themselves at their princes? Back to Pocahontas, this movie is my childhood. I remember watching it when I was little, I was obsessed. I would call knots in trees Grandmother Willow, laughed at Meeko and Flick, I sang and danced to the songs. And now, a fourteen year old, Pocahontas remains one of my favorite movies. Honestly, we need more movies like it. Killing has become so popular these days, and now we've lost sight of the importance of peace and love in the world. I know, I sound very cheesy, but it's true. I wonder if everyone in the world, right now, watched Pocahontas right now they might think twice before polluting or killing.I think Pocahontas is great for both kids and adults. All though the message may be a little deep for kids to wrap their minds around, they'll love the animation, animals, songs, and action. Maybe they'll even have some understanding of what's really happening. Adults would enjoy again the animation and the surprising maturity of the plot, and of course, the music as well.This movie is a must-see for children and adults alike, even if it is a kid's movie.

It cleaned up at the Academy Awards, becoming only the third film in history to win the Big Five Oscars of Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Writing, a feat which eluded many other Big Films. (The other two films to achieve the feat were It Happened One Night in 1934 and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in 1975). And yet, even though I can appreciate its many good points, it has never really been a favourite of mine. The reason it has never been a favourite of mine is probably that I don't like serial killer films very much. More recent essays in the genre such as The Bone Collector, Se7en and Copycat have struck me as very overrated and as having little to do with real-life crime. Zodiac, which provided a fictitious solution to a real crime, was both dull and distasteful in the way that it branded a (safely dead) real individual as the killer. Each of these films revolved around some sort of gimmick; in the case of The Bone Collector, for example, the gimmick was a brilliant but disabled detective, and in Se7en it was a killer who based his pattern of killing around the Seven Deadly Sins. The gimmick in The Silence of the Lambs is the concept of one serial killer helping the FBI to capture another. It was not the first film to feature the character of Hannibal Lecter (that was Manhunter from five years earlier), but it was the one that made him famous. Lecter is brilliant psychiatrist who also happens to be a cannibalistic serial killer. Because of Lecter's insights into the criminal mind, the FBI seek his help in their pursuit of a serial killer nicknamed Buffalo Bill, who kidnaps and murders women, then skins their corpses.The Silence of the Lambs shares one feature in common with The Bone Collector and Copycat. All three films feature a detective who is for some reason unable to investigate the crime in person, so the actual leg-work is done by a keen but inexperienced female associate. In The Bone Collector the detective is physically disabled; in Copycat she is confined to her apartment by severe agoraphobia. In this film it is Lecter rather than Clarice's superior Jack Crawford who is effectively the lead detective, but as he is incarcerated in a hospital for the criminally insane the actual investigative work has to be performed by Clarice Starling, a young FBI trainee. The two Oscars I would not dispute are those which went to Jodie Foster as Clarice and Anthony Hopkins as Lecter. Scott Glenn is rather uncharismatic as Crawford, but both Foster and Hopkins are brilliant. There are two sides to Hopkins's personality as an actor. On the one hand he can be excellent playing quiet, reserved or gentlemanly characters, like Dr Treves in The Elephant Man, Frank Doel in 84 Charing Cross Road, C S Lewis in Shadowlands or Stevens in The Remains of the Day. On the other, he can be equally effective as villainous or monstrous characters, like Lambert Leroux in Pravda or Crawford in Fracture, and Lecter is undoubtedly his most famous creation in this vein. Indeed, Lecter has become one of the most famous villains in the modern cinema, a man who is undoubtedly cultured and intellectually brilliant, possessed of both a rather grave old-world courtesy and a savage low cunning, and morally quite insane, quite incapable of understanding why killing and eating people is considered morally wrong, although he is fully aware that it is illegal. He describes with lip-smacking relish how he ate one individual's liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti. Foster's performance here is perhaps less obviously dramatic than those she gave in two other films from around this period, The Accused and Nell, but Clarice Starling is a rather different character to Nell or Sarah in The Accused- quiet, determined and professional, anxious to hide her emotions. She combines well with the more obviously flamboyant Hopkins as Lecter and Clarice start to play complicated mind-games with one another, each trying to get inside the other's head. (The film's rather obscure title derives from a traumatic episode in Clarice's childhood, which Lecter succeeds in worming out of her). There is also a good contribution from Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill.1991 was not perhaps the greatest year in cinematic history; I doubt very much if The Silence of the Lambs would have scooped the Big Five had it appeared in the same year as, say, Dances with Wolves (the Big Film of 1990) or Unforgiven (ditto of 1992). My own choice for Best Picture in 1991 would have been Zhang Yimou's masterly Raise the Red Lantern, but the Academy is notorious for its dislike of foreign-language films; all films to have won Best Picture have been American or British, apart from the French The Artist- which contained no spoken dialogue. My favourite American film of the year would probably have been Cape Fear, but in the early nineties the Academy was equally notorious for its dislike of Martin Scorsese. The Silence of the Lambs is well-directed; Jonathan Demme skilfully handles his material to produce a tense, exciting thriller. Yet despite this, and despite some fine acting, the film never really rises above the limitations of its genre, remaining a combination of Grand Guignol and gruesome crossword puzzle. (Sometimes almost literally so; Lecter shares the crossword compiler's weakness for puns, anagrams and word- games). It may be the best film ever made about a psychopathic criminal, but that only makes it a big fish in a small if overcrowded pond. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"31 January 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The Silence of the Lambs was the Big Film of 1991.

Because of Lecter's insights into the criminal mind, the FBI seek his help in their pursuit of a serial killer nicknamed Buffalo Bill, who kidnaps and murders women, then skins their corpses.The Silence of the Lambs shares one feature in common with The Bone Collector and Copycat. All three films feature a detective who is for some reason unable to investigate the crime in person, so the actual leg-work is done by a keen but inexperienced female associate. In The Bone Collector the detective is physically disabled; in Copycat she is confined to her apartment by severe agoraphobia. In this film it is Lecter rather than Clarice's superior Jack Crawford who is effectively the lead detective, but as he is incarcerated in a hospital for the criminally insane the actual investigative work has to be performed by Clarice Starling, a young FBI trainee. The two Oscars I would not dispute are those which went to Jodie Foster as Clarice and Anthony Hopkins as Lecter. Scott Glenn is rather uncharismatic as Crawford, but both Foster and Hopkins are brilliant. There are two sides to Hopkins's personality as an actor. On the one hand he can be excellent playing quiet, reserved or gentlemanly characters, like Dr Treves in The Elephant Man, Frank Doel in 84 Charing Cross Road, C S Lewis in Shadowlands or Stevens in The Remains of the Day. On the other, he can be equally effective as villainous or monstrous characters, like Lambert Leroux in Pravda or Crawford in Fracture, and Lecter is undoubtedly his most famous creation in this vein. Indeed, Lecter has become one of the most famous villains in the modern cinema, a man who is undoubtedly cultured and intellectually brilliant, possessed of both a rather grave old-world courtesy and a savage low cunning, and morally quite insane, quite incapable of understanding why killing and eating people is considered morally wrong, although he is fully aware that it is illegal. He describes with lip-smacking relish how he ate one individual's liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti. Foster's performance here is perhaps less obviously dramatic than those she gave in two other films from around this period, The Accused and Nell, but Clarice Starling is a rather different character to Nell or Sarah in The Accused- quiet, determined and professional, anxious to hide her emotions. She combines well with the more obviously flamboyant Hopkins as Lecter and Clarice start to play complicated mind-games with one another, each trying to get inside the other's head. (The film's rather obscure title derives from a traumatic episode in Clarice's childhood, which Lecter succeeds in worming out of her). There is also a good contribution from Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill.1991 was not perhaps the greatest year in cinematic history; I doubt very much if The Silence of the Lambs would have scooped the Big Five had it appeared in the same year as, say, Dances with Wolves (the Big Film of 1990) or Unforgiven (ditto of 1992). My own choice for Best Picture in 1991 would have been Zhang Yimou's masterly Raise the Red Lantern, but the Academy is notorious for its dislike of foreign-language films; all films to have won Best Picture have been American or British, apart from the French The Artist- which contained no spoken dialogue. My favourite American film of the year would probably have been Cape Fear, but in the early nineties the Academy was equally notorious for its dislike of Martin Scorsese. The Silence of the Lambs is well-directed; Jonathan Demme skilfully handles his material to produce a tense, exciting thriller. Yet despite this, and despite some fine acting, the film never really rises above the limitations of its genre, remaining a combination of Grand Guignol and gruesome crossword puzzle. (Sometimes almost literally so; Lecter shares the crossword compiler's weakness for puns, anagrams and word- games). It may be the best film ever made about a psychopathic criminal, but that only makes it a big fish in a small if overcrowded pond. 7\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"31 January 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Saving Private Ryan is technically impressive and well acted war film by Spielberg. I like Steven Spielberg as a director and he makes quality films, but when tries to make something about war and complex subject matters, he falls flat. His most successful serious film is Munich. I don't like emotional manipulation in a serious drama. I'm OK with it in a blockbuster or a kids film, but not in a film about Holocaust, Wold War II and so on.I liked the technical aspects of Saving Private Ryan but whenever the story and characters showed up, it was like a nails on a chalkboard.The cast, like in any Spielberg picture, is great. We have Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Giovanni Ribisi, Paul Giamatti, Vin Diesel and Matt Damon. They provide good performances and bring some depth to the characters.There are two impressive set pieces in the film. One is the opening sequence in the Normandy beach and the other is the battle in the small French town. They are flawlessly executed and give this fluff a sense of realism. While I do prefer the action scenes in Bullet in the Head better, but that's because John Woo and Vietnam War is a great combination.My problem with Saving Private Ryan is the fact that it's way too schmaltzy.

Plans change when womanizer dancer and third co-star Ted Hanover (Fred Astaire) steals the flighty Lily and both run away to continue their showbiz career. In reality Astaire was a decent man who was cast against his normal type; Lily expects presents on Father's Day. Meanwhile Jim learns about the difficulties in farming and fails; he has a nervous breakdown and recovers. He has a brilliant idea that he will open a song and dance dinner-club\/nightclub from an old barn he is converting. Shows will run only on holidays (about 15 annually). Jim tells his old agent Danny Reed (Walter Abel) to sent him some talent. At a flower shop Danny meets pretty blonde Linda Mason (Marjorie Reynolds) who recognizes him and says she can dance well and even sing. She wants a new career, and Danny gives her Jim's address. Jim and Linda both put on airs, but each catches the other and Linda does earn a starting role in the upcoming New Years Eve show. Jim and the beautiful Linda begin to fall for each other, and Linda shows that she can really sing and dance very well. In the meantime unstable Lila wanders again She leaves Ted for a Texas millionaire. Ted winds up at the opened Holiday Inn broken-hearted and drunk, but has a fabulous dance with Linda. Jim, having already lost a girl to Ted, maneuvers unsuspecting Linda away. Later Ted cannot remember anything about Linda, and all that agent Danny saw was Linda's shapely backside. If Danny can find Linda, he will try to link her with Ted for a new stage routine. Ted and Danny go back to the inn on the next scheduled holiday show, Lincoln's Birthday (12 February) in an effort to locate the unidentified dancing beauty. Spotting them, Jim smears the resisting Linda's face with black-face (acceptable at the time) backstage, to disguise her from Ted and Danny. The plan works, but St. Valentine's Day is only two days away. On that holiday, Danny eventually spots Linda despite unfortunate Jim's attempt at disruption. Jim and Linda perform a wonderful holiday dance (Be Careful, It's My Heart.). With the situation up in the air between Jim and Ted, on Easter Sunday Jim sings a beautiful song to Linda, who really shines here. Before long though Linda agrees to join Ted in Hollywood. Over the next few holidays, Ted and Linda become an item, and an engagement is publicized in newspapers and showbiz magazines.Jim, devastated at losing the gorgeous Linda to Ted, closes the inn and to survive writes music for the Hollywood movie being produced based on his own Holiday Inn. But he feels sorry for himself as the months of the year move on. On Thanksgiving Day, his maid Mamie (Louise Beavers) shakes him out of his long spell. She tells him not to mope, but to return to California to win back his girl. You could melt her heart right down to butter, if you'd only turn on the heat! Jim arrives by train a day before the proposed wedding, but Linda obviously has had feelings for him all along. So when she spots him, Ted has lost Linda to Jim for good. But all is not lost for Ted, for Lila has returned and he has apparently taken her back. The movie ends on New Years Eve with Happy Holiday.There are superb production numbers. Featured is perhaps the greatest hit of all time, the incomparable White Christmas. There are other Irving Berlin tunes, including Happy Holiday, Easter Parade, and I'll Capture Your Heart Singing. (By the way, Bing Crosby was rated the number one American pop singer in the 1890-1954 period by music historian Joel Whitburn. Bing's best period was the 1930s and 1940s; indomitable Frank Sinatra would later surpass Bing.) Catch Fred Astaire's fabulous solo firecracker dance on the 4th of July. What a talent! While smoking, he taps his way so perfectly with each sound from exploding firecrackers. It is certainly legit see the accumulation of firecracker paper on the stage. Marjorie Reynolds did not have many starring screen roles, although she was Peg in the 1950s TV sitcom Life of Riley. The movie concept may be flawed Can one make money if the inn is open only on holidays? Only if it caters to a rich crowd willing to pay, say, $1,000 per seat! Besides salaries and expenses, the house does need to pay its live orchestra! But the flick affords a feel-good Christmas classic by Paramount, and although filmed in black and white, is a bit better than White Christmas, made 12 years later.

Curiously, the Holiday Inn motel chain got its name from this movie just a decade after.CORRECT REASON FOR THE ANIMATED TURKEY ON THE November CALENDAR The turkey moves back and forth from 20 November, the third Thursday of the month, to 27 November, the fourth Thursday of the month. At the time of the movie's setting (1941), the Thanksgiving holiday was not yet settled on the fourth Thursday of the month throughout the USA, despite earlier proclamations by Presidents Washington and Lincoln. Some states were still celebrating Thanksgiving on the third Thursday while most others celebrated on the fourth Thursday, and a few even on the last Thursday (when November has five Thursdays). So the turkey was confused where to settle. The situation soon changed with House Resolution 41 (26 Dec 1941) and President Roosevelt's proclamation that supported only the fourth Thursday of the month.

And while it's better than Menace, and an OK film overall... The execution leaves something to be desired. The narration is done much better than in Menace, and the acting is certainly better. There is a bit more suspense here as well, but doesn't make up for a half and hour Padme-Anakin vacation. Some of the scenes work, but most of the time the scene is unnecessary. This movie feels much more like Titianic than Star Wars, unfortunately. Titanic was a good movie, but it doesn't really fit into Clones.But the movie has a much more solid plot, and the scenes and lines works much better! There aren't nearly as much plot holes, and there is a very good climax at the end! This movie is kinda' interesting to watch. When you think about the action and execution, you accept it as a decent movie. But the pace is even slower in Menace, and the movie is transformed into an awkward love story. Anakin is a grown man, so it's definitely for the better, but the chemistry between Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen is awful. And the movie is forced to center around these two characters dinner conversations and picnic trips... They should have shown more Obi-Wan! I found the Obi-Wan segments to be quite good. It has a mysterious flow to it, and we feel like we learn some things on the way, as Obi-Wan does. We see more of the new villain Count Dooku aka Darth Tyranus, who is perhaps a more solid villain than Darth Maul. Lee is a golden template on this movie, as he is one the best actors of the whole cast! One of the most powerful scenes in this movie is the showdown between Dooku and Yoda! I gotta' give Lucas credit for filming this scene so perfect! I saw original Star Wars quality there! In the end, Clones is a decent movie, that is quite better than Menace! The movie works better on all premises! But Clones is nothing compared to the original trilogy... Execept for the Yoda vs Dooku scene!

They had a few good post-Walt stuff prior to the Disney Renaissance (like Robin Hood, The Rescuers and even The Fox and the Hound,) but for the most part the magic seemed to be disappearing. It also didn't help that their The Black Cauldron (which didn't resemble a Disney animated film very much) was a major failure. So a smaller crew, featuring four directors (including Burny Mattinson of Mickey's Christmas Carol, and Ron Clements and John Musker, both of whom later went on to direct some memorable Disney animated features afterward), put together The Great Mouse Detective on a much smaller budget. Development took quite a while, but with the advancements on digital technology, the actual production only took a year! Also, it did very well at the box office and gained several positive reviews, which convinced Disney that their animated films had a future, and if it weren't for this film's success, we may not have had a Disney Renaissance! Aside from that, this is definitely Disney's best movie from their pre-Renaissance slump. You've got likable characters, great voice acting, a perfect music score (complete with theme tunes for each main character!), well-done animation and effects, and even a few songs for Disney tradition's sake! Vincent Price tends to steal the show with his excellent performance as Professor Ratigan (no wonder he got top billing!) I also enjoy Basil's ingenious thinking and over-the-top acting for a detective that can fit in the palm of your hand (I can't help but notice he almost looks like an anime character at times, the way he is designed.) Dr. Dawson and Olivia are also great characters, and Fidget is good at raging from downright creepy (his two horror-style jump-scare scenes) to your typical comical sidekick (what's not to love about a big-eyed one-legged bat that's unable to fly?) I also liked hearing Alan Young using his Scrooge McDuck voice for Mr. Flaversham. The songs are for the most part your standard Disney musical fare, but like I said, they're a lot of fun. Especially fun is Miss Kitty's Let Me Be Good to You musical number (that had to be a scene by Ron Clements and John Musker; they're known for crazy stuff like that, as seen in Aladdin and The Princess and the Frog!) The animation also has a very classic look and feel to it, which is rare for a Disney movie of this era. It also uses computer animation much better than The Black Cauldron did, and the climactic scene at Big Ben was quite thrilling and enough to keep you at the edge of your seat! I guess you could say that not only did Basil and company save London, they also saved Disney's feature animation division!There's also a fun use of Basil Rathbone's vocal performance as Sherlock Holmes (from a record version of The Red-Headed League) during a shadowed cameo of the REAL Sherlock Holmes.

North-West Frontier, for example, is a British film set in British-ruled India, but the plot is essentially that of Stagecoach. Untamed transfers the standard waggon-train plot from the American prairies to the South African veldt, and The Sundowners, about Australian pioneer life, has similarities to many films set in the Old West. These two latter films, despite their ostensible setting, had an American leading man, Tyrone Power in Untamed and Robert Mitchum in The Sundowners. The Man from Snowy River is another Australian film with a plot which could be that of a Western. (One could call it a Southern). It also features a major American star, in this case Kirk Douglas, in a leading role. Or perhaps I should say that it features Kirk Douglas in two leading roles, the brothers Harrison, a wealthy cattle farmer, and Spur, a prospector. The action takes place in Victoria during the 1880s. Apart from the two brothers, the main character is Jim Craig, the Man from Snowy River himself. Jim is a young man orphaned by the death of his father in an accident, who goes to work on Harrison's station. The three main strands of the plot concern the relationship between the two brothers, who have been estranged for many years, the growing romance between Jim and Harrison's daughter Jessica, and the efforts to recapture a valuable stallion belonging to Harrison, which has escaped and is running with a herd of wild horses. There are a number of differences in terminology; the wild horses are referred to as brumbies rather than mustangs, Harrison's landholding is described as a station rather than a ranch and the reward for the recapture of the stallion is expressed in pounds rather than dollars. With those and a few other exceptions, however, the above synopsis could easily be that of a typical Western. And yet in some ways this is a very Australian film. The title and the story of the hunt for the escaped stallion derive from a narrative poem by the bush poet Banjo Paterson, although the other two strands of the plot are the inventions of the scriptwriters. Paterson himself appears as a character, as does Clancy of the Overflow, the hero of another of his poems. Paterson is something of a national icon in Australia, largely because his poetry helped to create the legend of the Australian bushman, the tough, individualistic inhabitant of the Outback who plays a role in the Australian national imagination similar to that played by the cowboy in the American one. Clancy himself- a real individual, not a fictitious character- has come to be seen as the archetypal bushman. The Man from Snowy River was made in 1982 during a decade when very few traditional Westerns were being made in America itself. (Perhaps the attraction of the film for Douglas was that it gave him a chance to star in one last Western). This was, however, a period when the Australian New Wave was starting to give that country its own cinematic identity with films about Australian history like Picnic at Hanging Rock and Breaker Morant. This film, therefore, can be seen, not as an attempt to imitate Hollywood, but rather as an attempt to celebrate Australia's own history and culture in the way that the Western celebrated American history and culture. That other great celebration of the bushman, Crocodile Dundee, a comedy with a contemporary setting, was to come shortly afterwards. There are no really great acting performances, although Douglas copes well with the challenge of playing two very different characters, the autocratic, patrician Harrison and the more free-spirited Spur, even if his accent does not always hold up. The film is shot against some attractive mountain scenery, and the action sequences, especially the hunt for the missing stallion, are well done. This is a film which will appeal to anyone with an interest in Australia's past, as well to all horse-lovers. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"31 January 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" We often think of the Western as being a characteristically American film genre, although there have been occasional attempts to adapt its conventions to stories set in other parts of the world.
