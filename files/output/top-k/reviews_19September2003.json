Miraculously the wish comes true which causes countless problems for Fletcher whose job as a lawyer may be in jeopardy unless he is able to lie.Director Tom Shadyac teams up with Jim Carrey for the first time since the hilarious &#145;Ace Ventura Pet Detective' (1994) and while one may expect more of the same, &#145;Liar Liar' benefits somewhat from having a tighter and heart-warming story rather than just the usual Carrey hijinks. The rubber-faced comic master Jim Carrey is at his best for this movie and while his off the wall antics provide seemingly endless humour, it is the poignant and touching scenes towards the end that really stand out in my opinion and prove Carrey's incredible acting ability. Once again Carrey steals the show but strong performances from Jennifer Tilly and Maura Tierney allow Carrey's natural comic ability to bounce around during the movie and makes for some humorous scenes in which Carrey was not involved.Credit should be given to writers Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur who managed to create an accomplished for Carrey to feed off, and feed off it he did. The screenplay is fairly tight and, despite a few plot problems, allows for a heart-warming story to be told despite the often complete lunacy being portrayed. The relationships between Max, Audrey (Tierney) and Fletcher are shown to the viewer in an almost profound and meaningful way. Despite Justin Cooper's limited acting abilities (though considering his age one can hardly expect an Oscar-winning performance!) the viewer is made to feel sorry for Max because of all the hurt he has felt in his relatively short life so far.As with most Carrey films there will be people who just do not find Carrey's unique brand of humour funny. The jokes are generally more mature than earlier films such as &#145;Ace Ventura Pet Detective' (1994) and &#145;Dumb & Dumber' (1995) which might impress those who were less than impressed with the often infantile humour found in his earlier films but still might not be enough to make an impact on the non-Carrey fans. Personally I feel that &#145;Liar Liar' is Carrey's finest work to date which benefits from Carrey's bizarre behaviour, an enjoyably talented supporting cast and a strong script featuring some great gags, witty one-liners and a heart-warming story.

It's too slow-moving in the beginning, and when it does pick up speed it seems dreary and pretty corny, actually. Not to say it's a bad film -- The Hunted and such films were much worse -- but in light of how excellent the first film was, this one deals a major blow.Tommy Lee Jones is back as Marshal Sam Gerard. Dressed in a chicken suit he raids the apartment of a criminal and gets on a plane to transport him and the baddie to Missouri. There's another man on that plane named Mark (Wesley Snipes), who has been accused of a crime he hasn't committed. A convict tries to assassinate Mark onboard, causing the plane to go through some unfortunate motions and crash in a swamp land. Mark escapes from the authorities, however, and flees into the swamp lands. Jones begins the chase to hunt his felon down. We've got a fugitive, he barks, probably posing for the TV ads.Robert Downey, Jr. joins the chase along with Cosmo (Joe Pantoliano) and Gerard's old team. This film centers more on Gerard's Marshals than the criminal chase element, which is probably why it's called U.S. Marshals and not The Fugitive II. The whole Wesley Snipes scenario serves to be a silly excuse to see Sam running about with his team.They chase, jump, fight, chase, leap on a train, chase some more, fight some more, kill, kill a bit more, and so on and so forth. The Fugitive was a chase film, a thriller, a mystery, an intense character study between two men who find they may have more in common than they think. Harrison Ford's Richard Kimble was a man we could sympathize with just as much as Tommy Lee Jones' Sam Gerard -- a key element to the film. It showed us both sides of the chase. This is just a routine chase film for the most part -- with the occasional breathtaking stunt -- but they're not nearly as breathtaking as those in the predecessor.The movie kills off a considerably important main character during its course, something you aren't really expecting. Yes, it was a pretty big surprise, given the fact that it is someone from the first film who you aren't expecting to get killed off -- but when it happened it felt more like a cheap surprise -- one made by the director as to wow us and make us take the film more seriously. I call this a cheap thrill.And the final problem I will address is Wesley Snipes' convicted good guy. We're supposed to believe he's a good guy, to genuinely root for him, but his character is not nearly as empathizable as he should be. Harrison Ford created a man we truly cared for -- a man who had really gotten the raw end of the deal. He threatened to harm people a few times but never harmed anyone. In fact, he even saved a little boy in a hospital while being chased after by the cops. Wesley Snipes' character Mark is a selfish character who will do anything to survive -- even if it means holding a knife to a woman's throat and telling her husband to drive him across a bridge and lie to police troopers, or even if he were to fire a gun at the U.S. Marshals on his tail. Sam later says, If he wanted to kill me, he wouldn't have aimed for my chest protector. It doesn't matter -- he still shot the guy and nearly shot another Marshal so he could escape. It made me wonder what Harrison Ford's character would have done given the circumstance. But then again, Richard Kimble wouldn't have been stupid enough to flee into deep marsh land where he could be easily trapped, either.

His acting is better and more convincing, as I lean towards the feeling that he is more himself in those movies, and not just wearing the hard core mask of a heartless b*st*rd.In this installment of Seagal's Tough Guy movies, he is up against a Jamaican posse (gang) headed by a very strong bocor (pronounced ba-kwa) of the Dark Arts, and all his drug dealing minions. It's a nice twist on the usual drug lord\/hard-line cop confrontation. The action is very compelling and the acting is believable and professional.

Hatcher's pursuit of the notorious Screwface takes him to Jamaica's darkly beautiful and mysterious underground where he learns the secret of his new nemesis, before engaging him in a final explosive (and eye-opening\/heart-rending) confrontation. All in all an enjoyable and entertaining 90 (or so) minutes.It gets a 7.5\/10 from...the Fiend .

I like good clean humor based on bizarre situations, and this movie hit the mark, unlike any other film I've seen.  In Caro Diario (Dear Diary), Nani Moretti directs himself as the main character in three chapters. He is portrayed as a slightly eccentric man who rarely smiles, but ends up pursuing somewhat odd pursuits.In the first chapter, he rides his Vespa scooter in the suburbs of Rome. He likes to explore different neighborhoods and think about what kinds of people live in each.  When he finds homes of particular interest, he makes up a story about his being a filmmaker and considering that apartment to be a set to make an excuse to see the inside.I like the second chapter the best, where Nani goes to visit a friend in the Italian islands who is studying James Joyce's Ulysses for 30 years (if memory serves me right).  He wants to share quiet time to work on his own project, making a film based on collected clippings of strange real-world stories from the newspapers.In their quest to find the ideal island to work on, I found the funniest part of the film, where they are on an island where it seems everybody has a child.  When people call each other, the children always pick up and inevitably the adults find themselves playing a game of what does the cow say?  moo!  what does the duck say?  quack!, the children urging them on and not passing the phone on.  I laughed quite a bit when Nani finds three folks near each other all on public telephones trying, in vain, to talk to their adult friends; he pauses, then makes an animal noise as his contribution!The third chapter is slightly less interesting than the other two.  In this concluding portion, Nani is faced with a terrible itch when he sleeps.  He consults doctor after doctor - skin doctors, allergists, acupuncturists, ... - and gets different advise from each.  After collecting a large collection of creams, pills, and tinctures, he ends up visiting a surgeon.It was a fun film that the whole family would enjoy, with a bizarre, wry, humor. Though I didn't enjoy it as much as the film Amelie, the quirkiness in Caro Diario reminds me a little bit of Amelie, especially in the 1st chapter.  This film is in Italian with English subtitles.

In the real world, Chance the Gardener would not have lasted very long walking around in the heart of D.C. looking for some kind black lady to make him lunch. Even if he made it past the street gangs, he would have been figured out as a simpleton in a millisecond by rich billionaire Ben Rand, if not by his doctor or butler. Chance's words about caring for the garden of the American economy would not have made it past the first commercial break of The Gary Burns Show. The contrived nature of Being There works only when you see it as a fable rather than as cinema verite. But then, then it works with an almost perfect splendor.The only way to begin an appreciation of this film is with Peter Sellers. He had an amazing film career, amazing in that he created such a comic gold standard (the best of the sound era, I think it can be safely said) without having very many great or even very good films to his credit. Sellers was funny, and he was gifted, but only rarely did it come together in a way that radiated the magic he was capable of. Here, in what literally turned out to be the last months of his life, and in obviously frail health, he turned in a performance that stands with the dozen greatest screen performances ever. He plays a slow-witted character who is completely dead to the nuances of life around him, and by being so, brings life to those who are otherwise left to wither at the vine. He revives the spirits of aging plutocrat Melvyn Douglas, and uncoils Shirley MacLaine, but sadly, feels none of those stirrings for himself. He is truly God's fool in that the grace he brings is completely outside himself, and as we look into his placid, friendly, unknowing face, we feel a sadness that's hard to describe. Maybe it has to do with the short life Sellers had left to him when this film was made. But this film would pack much the same punch if Sellers was with us still. He never plays it for pathos, just for laughs, but what we are left with is more than a bit of both.What else is it about Being There that makes it special? I think it comes down to tone. The tone of the film is not that of a laugh-out-loud comedy. It tries to be funny, and succeeds, in ways that standard dramas do not. Hal Ashby manages a feat of control here that's almost fearsome. He maintains the sad, minor-key aura (a silent-movie score) that lends the film its strength and sinew. You can hear it in the music, the way the lilting classic strains of piano and harp joins with the cold white chill that comes through the windowpanes in casting an almost sepulchral feeling to the proceedings, yet it never feels deadly or morbid. We are always made aware of the life around us.Another thing The film really is funny. It only works when you suspend disbelief and realize you are not watching All The President's Men, but when you do, the film takes on a real humor. The tone is never jovial, but it has laughs, snickers, and a pervasive geniality that inspires all the more when you realize how much of the movie is about death and loss.Of all the credits, one deserving special attention is that of Dianne Schroeder, who apparently found all the then-contemporary TV bits to weave into the narrative. Throughout the film, we are treated to a Greek chorus of ephemeric commercials and news clips that all neatly dovetail to the action in the story, nowhere more so then early on, when Chance gets the news of the Old Man's passing as some unnamed character consoles Sesame Street's Big Bird with the lilting, tender jingle Sugar And Spice. And how about that seduction scene played out while Mr. Rogers discusses friendship with Mr. McFeeley? Basketball Jones almost brings a sob to one's throat as we watch Chance's entrance to the Rand Estate. Cheech and Chong's finest screen moment, undoubtedly.Ultimately, it all comes back to Sellers. What a triumph. That last image of him on the pond is indelible. Maybe sticking in those blooper bits at the end cost him the Oscar to Dustin Hoffman in Kramer Vs. Kramer (that and all the divorced fathers who were voting members in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1980), but it is such a tribute to his level of genius, and his sense of fun, to have that as a wrapper for what was a career we will never see the likes of again. I'll take it over an Oscar; hell, Sellers has been dead more than 20 years, his winning or not winning an Oscar stopped being important decades ago, but his chortling failure at passing on Raphael's message will remain something to be enjoyed long after you and I join Peter and Melvyn in that big room upstairs.

However if you're going to reinvent a cartoon as a serious character, you need a serious script!  Serious violence and a serious topic are simply not enough when combined with cartoonish action and 'spy gear', and much as I enjoy Wayne Newton's comic abilities, they simply don't fit with where the writers' are trying to go in this movie.  I loved seeing David Hedison, I loved seeing Anthony Zerbe, I always loved Desmond Llewelyn.  They just don't belong in a serious espionage film!While Bond fans will note that elements of License to Kill have been recycled from other Ian Fleming stories, a great deal of this story has also been swiped from Tom Clancy, from the sexual-revenge angle to the pressure-chamber execution.  What's lacking is Clancy's overarching geopolitical awareness.  Such concerns would eventually surface in later Bonds - but not until Dalton had left the franchise, which is a pity, because I find him much easier to take seriously than Brosnan (the latter a wonderful actor, but whose edge of Irish humor has yet to be perfectly worked into the series.)Robert Davi always does a fine acting job, but Bond villains simply need to be larger than life - the aims of the film may be the problem here.

Cary Lowell, meanwhile, does a fine job of playing the Bond Babe of the Honor Blackman 'tough girl' school.I'd love to see a 'serious' Bond movie - which would be set in the '50's, give us a tough counter-spy Bond more comfortable in eurotrash watering holes than Attlee's bureaucratized Britain, and idealistic Communist opponents.

And as the good-hearted people wake up one-by-one the little cult that kept the buzz alive grows weaker, and fewer people are subjected to this film.

The 1950s setting absorbs you into the seedy world of New Orleons where Angel is hired to track down Johnny Favourite by the ominous entrepreneur, Cypher. The mood throughout is intense as we discover piece by piece what initially seemed like a typical Chandleresque story is in fact something more sinister. There is still a lingering sense constantly that not all is as it should be. And believe me it really isn't in this evocative combination of the supernatural and film noir. I found Rourke, in one of his better roles, believable as the confused and doomed detective and DeNiro's underused Mr. Cypher incredibly chilling. Unforgettable scenes include the infamous sex scene between Rourke and Bonet, DeNiro's infamous 'the egg is the soul' scene and the ending twist, that I found far more effective than those of alternate broody films such as The Sixth Sense or Fight Club. This is definitely not the sort of film you'd want to show at a family gathering.

I found Rourke, in one of his better roles, believable as the confused and doomed detective and DeNiro's underused Mr. Cypher incredibly chilling. Unforgettable scenes include the infamous sex scene between Rourke and Bonet, DeNiro's infamous 'the egg is the soul' scene and the ending twist, that I found far more effective than those of alternate broody films such as The Sixth Sense or Fight Club.
