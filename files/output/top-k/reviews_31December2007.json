Disappointed at the fact that I took so long to watch this movie and happy that I didn't miss it out!!!!Definitely the BEST movie I've ever seen. The direction, cinematography, acting...in fact everything was really good. But at times I felt some scenes were too long, especially the torturing scenes. But then I realized that maybe these scenes really gave the over all impact to the movie. This movie is shown at the backdrop of one of the most darkest period of human history (World War II).... Its shown in black and white due to that very reason!!!!! This is the shocking true story of Oskar Schindler, who never lost his sight when everyone from his own land were blind, who never lost humanity when he was surrounded by animals!!!Never before have I got so involved with a character in a movie that I felt each and everything that went through Schindler's mind. Who do I have to praise that for, the style of direction or the well written script???? In the climax part when Schindler breaks down to tears I was shocked to find myself break down to tears for the first time after seeing a Movie!!!! Thats the power of this film!!!!!If there is anyone else out there who hasn't seen this movie yet then PLZ....Please....Don't waste your time reading this or any review, instead rush and watch this movie as soon as possible!!!! In fact this has to be watched by everyone at least once in their lifetime, not for the purpose of entertainment but for a wonderful LESSON!!!!!

Can you imagine waiting for something great in any contemporary high school comedy ? At this one you can.Maybe it's the most marvelous story for that kind of movies, a rare exceptional one without the same idiot work about some idiot students which is full of the usual quantity of bad taste, the ordinary amount of sex jokes and the regular irregular images of young Americans ! It is one funny movie indeed which will live longer than its likes not only because its solid atmosphere or smart script but basically for its main motif. It's about a middle class disintegrated family with tones of problems and one talented kid who wants to get away from all of this to make his own separate career as a writer, however he must get through that journey to discover one hell of a neglected fact about how he needs his family and his family needs him as everyone wanting the other to cure oneself, so he must run to his home not out of it ! I believe that the creative writer can't create honestly when he gets out of his original experiences, or his basic cases that he can't escape from them. So the clever meaning which (Orange County) simply poses is that the talented author is the one who creates from his people and for them. In fact the way of the movie to present this was plainly and soberly.Despite whatever looked as indecent or trite in dealing with its characters, it was unlike nearly all the kind's comedies, having some rationality that could proficiently keep the humanity of the characters and their sick pathetic conditions with the ability to mock at their sad ironic features or acts in the same time, but without losing the beautiful deep message or being that busy all the time of making only gross laughs.I loved all the cast as maybe the best ever for a small nice movie like this.

Many aspects about World War II are incorrectly portrayed in The Longest Day. First, not all of the German high command were complete idiots. Second, not all the French were in favor of the allied invasion. And last but not least, it was not as easy for soldiers coming from the naval war carriers to hit the beach at Normandie. When it was released, The Longest Day was probably appropriate for its audiences who were only a stones throw away from the war and probably wanted to see escapist fair. However, 45 years later, the film does not uphold as well against far more realistic depictions of war such as Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, even Patton. Except for a sequence in the latter part of the movie in which the allied forces move inland, much of the movie suffers from too many clichés, too many unrealistic situations, and dialog that has become almost laughable.If someone who had never been taught anything about World War II were to see this movie, he or she might well believe that all the Americans were heroes, the English were constantly ingenious, the French loved Americans (and maybe the English too), and the Germans were a bunch of nincompoops. The problem may go deeper as this is the portrait that is often painted in US High School text books. The picture on this Hollywood canvas is over the top idealism in both directions. It's hard to believe, based on this movie, that the Germans were smart enough to get their uniforms on correctly, let alone almost capture Europe. When the Germans learn of the shrewd moves made by the allies, their reactions remind me of the bad guys in the old Batman TV show. Or maybe Colonel Clink in Hogan's Heros. The Germans either blow their tops (I almost expected smoke to start coming out of their ears) or they dismiss what they're hearing. The movie shows a German lookout at the beach becoming frantic, dropping his binoculars at the sight of all the war ships. When he phones the high command, they at first insist that the allies don't even have that many ships before realizing the invasion is on and they go crazy. And the few references to Hitler make him seem more like a spoiled grammar school boy than one of the most feared men in the world. One officer says that the Führer is having another one of his tantrums. The problem is the movie rarely breaks away from its own cliché rhetoric. The characters constantly talk about making history and heroism as if ground soldiers would say such things in the heat of battle. It just gets a little much. While the German high command are insulting each other, the American and British high command are portrayed as much more organized and deliberate in their actions. Robert Mitchum and John Wayne who play the high ranking officers at the ground level seemed like they were plucked out of a novel rather than portraying real people. Every line, every command, and every decision is prophetic. And the men obey their commands as if they came from Moses! And every time the allied forces were about to attack, a high ranking officer always prefaces it with a patriotic speech! Maybe that was a motivation to go and fight so you didn't have to hear another one!The actual invasion at the beach is probably the weakest and least realistic aspect of the entire film. In reality scores of men were mowed down by gunfire long before they ever got to the beach. Here, about 1 in 50 seems to get hit by gunfire. I guess the Germans just weren't very good shots. Another rather insulting piece of Hollywood melodrama shows a Frenchman becoming overly ecstatic at the appearance of the allied forces at the Normandy beaches. (I guess he couldn't wait to get an autograph from a movie star, considering just about every major Hollywood talent was drafted into this movie, including Richard Burton and Roddy McDowell.) In reality, the attitude toward the invasion was more ambivalent. There were many French who were not thrilled with the allied invasion, but these diversities are never touched upon.There are some good visuals in the film, and some great shots from above. Overall, a rather mixed movie that has a few moments of interest and a lot of cliché silly lines, and parts that are simply bad history. But as the old adage says, the heroes write the history.

It opens with a rousing action sequence in the jungles of 'Nam that is interrupted when we learn it was all a dream. Chuck Norris sits up in bed and watches TV. Then he walks to the window and... and... the exact same thing happens. We cut to another rousing action sequence, just a dream. Then he watches TV some more. At this point you might be worried that the movie is stuck in some sort of causal loop, but this is not the case. Chuck is watching Spiderman and His Amazing Friends, and a scene with The Shocker breaking out of prison inspires him to go rescue POWs in Vietnam (no, for real). It seems there is a conference in Saigon to determine whether there are still American POWs being held in the country, and Chuck has been invited to attend. He attends, and makes the American government look bad by being a dick, but it turns out he has a secret plan to sneak away from the conference for a few hours, rescue the POWs himself, and bring them back to the conference as evidence. The ensuing action is not quite as good as the Delta Force movies, but it's acceptable. I have to admit great fondness for the scene where Chuck emerges from the water with an M60 and blows the laughing soldiers away. I also admit fondness for his INCREDIBLE bulletproof raft--yes, a bulletproof f**king raft, undoubtedly the greatest movie raft until Waterworld came along (it may even give the Waterworld raft a run for its money). Chuck also gets to tear a woman's top off in order to fool the police into thinking he has been in bed with her all evening when he has actually been out assassinating Communist leaders. Regarding this being a clone of Rambo 2 while that may be the better movie, production-quality-wise, I was surprised to learn that it came later and apparently stole this plot. And while I would never diss Rambo himself, Sly Stallone's garbled voice and mopey face make him seem like he has an IQ of maybe 80. Say what you will about Chuck Norris, he can at least speak articulately. And he did his own stunts here--an impressive feat to say the least.

The ensuing action is not quite as good as the Delta Force movies, but it's acceptable. I have to admit great fondness for the scene where Chuck emerges from the water with an M60 and blows the laughing soldiers away. I also admit fondness for his INCREDIBLE bulletproof raft--yes, a bulletproof f**king raft, undoubtedly the greatest movie raft until Waterworld came along (it may even give the Waterworld raft a run for its money). Chuck also gets to tear a woman's top off in order to fool the police into thinking he has been in bed with her all evening when he has actually been out assassinating Communist leaders. Regarding this being a clone of Rambo 2 while that may be the better movie, production-quality-wise, I was surprised to learn that it came later and apparently stole this plot. And while I would never diss Rambo himself, Sly Stallone's garbled voice and mopey face make him seem like he has an IQ of maybe 80. Say what you will about Chuck Norris, he can at least speak articulately. And he did his own stunts here--an impressive feat to say the least. The Rambo series may be awe-inspiring, but neither should the M.I.A. movies be dismissed so easily. 7\/10.

So, according to my general policy of not watching movies based on books I like, I've never seen this movie, till they had a month of David Lynch at our Cinmateque earlier this year (including an appearance of Lynch himself, who talked only about transcendental meditation, of course). The task Lynch has taken upon himself here was very difficult, and to an extent he failed. I don't see how he could have really relay all that is in that book into the screen in such a short film (and they say they even made him make it shorter than he planned) and how can people really get the atmosphere and background of the story from the movie if they haven't read the book. Indeed, my wife who came with me and didn't read the book, didn't _really_ understand what was it all about. Maybe if it was a long TV series it would have worked well. That said, this movie has an amazing and powerful atmosphere and really manages, with its distinct visual language, to suck you into another world. I enjoyed it a lot in that aspect, and if Lynch could have stayed away a little from his usual love for the disgusting, I would have enjoyed it much better. For people who appreciate good and different cinema this is a good experience. Lynch followers should see it as well. It is a good complementary to spice up the book too. But most of all, it left me with a feeling of a missed opportunity. I would have loved to be able to watch a TV series by lynch based on the book (or a 3 full length movies).

I didn't find myself gripped to know what was happening next as the film rattled along its wooden acting tracks. The acting for me was the biggest drawback. The delivery tends to be dull, even from the American actors. There is some interesting use of colour, but for this viewer I can only express disappointment on this movie.

This time it's war! Caesar butts heads with Aldo, a war-monger gorilla with a thick skull and a less than one-sided personality who is reminiscent of the Michael Biehn character in Planet Terror Give em the guns! Give em ALL the guns! And so, war is waged between the straggling humans and the now powerful apes and gorillas. Will there be a voice of reason? The plot doesn't have much cohesion except to make it clear that this one will tie up whatever loose ends there needs to be with the first part, just in case anyone really wants to take notice (of course, there are some more than thousands of years in gap space between five and one, but who's counting). In the most crucial scenes in the picture, where the battle is waged harshest and Aldo has to answer for a horrible atrocity, Thompson only films it adequately enough so that it doesn't ring badly on TV. There are some ambitions in the script, even to include the original Lawgiver, played by none other than the great John Huston. But it's not for much trouble; there's even a lapse of judgment in seeming to put in lots of footage from the PAST films for some reason, which must be attributed to laziness on the writers and editors.Probably on par, if not maybe a smidgen above, the 2001 remake of POTA, 'Battle' doesn't end with a bang, but with a bunch of bangs that amount to the emotional wallop of a whimper.
