Purely because it's a different beast and lumping it in a convenient J-horror niche is doing it a disservice. I won't go into plot specifics because it's only a skeleton for Kurosawa to hang his atmospherics. That said, I can understand the complaint many viewers seem to share (man, it doesn't make sense) but without having any claims on solving Cure's riddle, I'm satisfied with letting wash over me, one watch at a time. Kurosawa wisely doesn't attempt to explain his plot. He's content to lift the veil just enough for us to sneak a glimpse in before he disorients again. The plot slowly builds through little tokens that are never followed by an orchestral crescento to signal their arrival. They just happen. A small photo in a book, muffled words on a phonogram, an old video, the ramblings of an amnesiac, theories on 18th century Austrian doctors. In the course of the film, everything seems to be coming together only to remain elusive in the end. In that aspect I find Cure to be closer to Last Year at Marienbad than your average Ringu clone. It's not about making sense, it's about pushing limits within which you can. It's about soaking in the impression it makes. When muffled words come through a phonogram, they're more incoherent ramblings than a telegraphed plot solution; but they contribute just as well to the overarching feel. This elliptic mentality is abetted by Kurosawa's choice of a slow, deliberate pace and many long shots, entire scenes covered without any cuts. The gritty and rundown aspect of Tokyo is photographed like a more naturalistic version of David Fincher's work and does the job well.It's my impression that a surrealist air hovers above and at the heart of Cure, at times reminiscent of a more languid version of Lynch. It is undoubtedly a horror movie so don't be put off by my Resnais comparison, but it's as much bleak as it is subtle and leaves enough to the mind's eye to make you carry it out with you.

Because this is the original film, naturally I had big expectations that it would be much better than the 2005 remake. It is certainly superior to the 2005 remake, but not as much as I imagined. While it certainly isn't a tremendous film, it is perfectly watchable, entertaining and without much bad stuff. But I found it just okay. I didn't find it good enough to consider it a true classic or good enough to add to my movie collection.Now, seriously. The movie is for sure much more elaborate and appealing than the 2005 remake. The sceneries are much more natural-looking and way more pleasant to look at (for example, the factory looks beautiful outside, especially with that church-like tower with a clock, and the factory itself is so much nicer inside than in the 2005 version). Frankly, Gene Wilder makes a much better and more likable Willy Wonka. Gene Wilder is exactly what Willy Wonka is supposed to be eccentric and enigmatic, but without being a weirdo and also without that horrible haircut and without a dark sense of humor. Johnny Depp, on the other, makes a too weird and eccentric Willy Wonka with a dark sense of humor and an awful haircut, in a controversial combination that resembles Michael Jackson. The ending of this movie is very different (and better) either.In this movie, even the bratty kids aren't that annoying. Except for Veruca (the spoiled and selfish girl), the others aren't excessive. Violet, for example, isn't as irritating as the same character in the 2005 version and the same happens with Mike Teavee. In fact, only in one or two brief scenes Mike Teavee proves to be rude. Otherwise, he's funny for his cowboy-like clothes and attitudes. Charlie Bucket is, naturally, the nicest kid.Like I said, Gene Wilder is great as Willy Wonka. Peter Ostrum was great as Charlie Bucket (his only movie role ever), Paris Themmen is pretty cool as the TV-obsessed Mike Teavee and Jack Albertson is good as Grandpa Joe. Mel Stuart made a much better job by directing this movie than Tim Burton in the remake.Another attribute here is the soundtrack. The songs are charming. Besides, the movie is made in an old-fashioned style, another reason why it is superior to the modern version.I like the scene when Grandpa Joe and Charlie are floating in the air between balls of soap, but I think it is too much what happens to Violet when she tastes something she shouldn't. Besides, those Oompa-Loompas bug me for some reason - I don't like them any better than those from the 2005 version, but at least here they always wear the same clothes, unlike that balderdash we see in the recent film.

Well, I must say that it deserves it. Before Psycho, censorship was extremely strict. Psycho broke a lot of rules in its day... not only did it go above and beyond with its famous murder sequences, but it also went above and beyond with smaller censorship rules. Psycho was the first American film where the audience could clearly see a flushing toilet in full frame. Psycho was also the first film to show a women walking around in her under-garments for an extended period of time. If Psycho had not come around, it could very well be possible that the idea of Jason stabbing a teenage couple having sex would have been frowned upon by the censorship boards. Psycho changed the way movies where made, which is what opened up the idea of the slasher film, and the horror genre in general.There had been horror films before Psycho, but none broke all of the rules that Psycho had. All the rules that Psycho broke became rules that everyone broke. For this reason, there have been too many Psycho rip-offs to count. Scream, Friday the 13th, Saw, A Nightmare On Elm Street, Halloween, and even Black Christmas are all pure rip-offs of Psycho's success. This could very well be Psycho's only con, and it isn't even the film's fault. Now don't get me wrong, Halloween and Friday the 13th are good films, but if you are at all interested in horror\/suspense, you have to view the movie that set new standards for the genre when it was released in 1960. Today, in 2008, Psycho doesn't seem nearly as well done as it was when it was released. However, it is just as good as it used to be. The only reason it doesn't seem good is because of one thing... publicity. AFI, Youtube, Google... It's all the same. Surly everyone alive today has seen the shower scene somewhere, whether or not they have seen the movie. I had personally seen certain scenes before viewing the film itself, so a large amount of the impact was lost for me. Psycho still left a chill on my back, and worked very well. If you are one of the lucky few who haven't seen clips of Psyhco, I highly encourage that you do not search for any. Search out the movie itself. As for the film itself, it is purely remarkable. The cast is extremely remarkable. Anthony Perkins is extremely amazing in his role as Norman Bates. Perkin's performance isn't only Oscar-Worthy, it is also one of the greatest performances of all time. It is up there with Anthony Hopkins' role as Hannibal Lector in my book. Janet Leight and Vera Miles are also very good actresses, and fit the role of heroine in Psycho very well. The acting in Psycho doesn't seem dated at all.The suspense is also spectacular in Psycho. Alfred Hitchcock's brilliant directing and Bennard Herrman's chilling score work together to build up atmosphere and suspense for the film. This is done extremely well. Psycho may very well be one of the most suspenseful movies of all time. Another thing that helps with the amount of atmopshere of the movie is how real it looks and feels. Everything in this movie seems realistic to the viewer. You can relate to the people in the film, especially with the way the characters are developed.Psycho may very well be the flawless movie. It has everything to not only make it a great horror film, but a great film as well. Any horror fan should check out Psycho, simply because it set so many new levels in the genre. Any film fan in general should check out Psycho is well, simply because it is so well made. Psycho is a must view for everyone. A lot of the movies from the 50s and 60s seem very cheesy by today's standards of computer animation and slang talk. However, Psycho still fits in with the classics. This is because Alfred Hitchcock directed his movies for the audience, not for the critics. This is obviously why the critics responded terribly to it. There were very few positive reviews for Psycho by all of the huge film critics, yet it still ranks as the 21st greatest film ever made on the IMDb top list. Hitchcock was able to not only make this movie well, but he was also able to make it enjoyable.Psycho still ranks in with the HORROR classics as well. Perhaps this is due the way it inspired so many films to come after it. This may also be due the fact that Psycho plays with all of the fears that thrilled audiences just as much today as it did in 1960; The thrill of running from the police; The fear of run-down motels; The fear of strangers; The feel of taking showers alone; and of course The fear of our mother's rage.For more horror film reviews, check out my channel on youtube horrorreviews123 ","genre":null},{"date":"29 June 2008","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Psycho takes a lot of credit for starting the modern horror genre.

This could very well be Psycho's only con, and it isn't even the film's fault. Now don't get me wrong, Halloween and Friday the 13th are good films, but if you are at all interested in horror\/suspense, you have to view the movie that set new standards for the genre when it was released in 1960. Today, in 2008, Psycho doesn't seem nearly as well done as it was when it was released. However, it is just as good as it used to be. The only reason it doesn't seem good is because of one thing... publicity. AFI, Youtube, Google... It's all the same. Surly everyone alive today has seen the shower scene somewhere, whether or not they have seen the movie. I had personally seen certain scenes before viewing the film itself, so a large amount of the impact was lost for me. Psycho still left a chill on my back, and worked very well. If you are one of the lucky few who haven't seen clips of Psyhco, I highly encourage that you do not search for any. Search out the movie itself. As for the film itself, it is purely remarkable. The cast is extremely remarkable. Anthony Perkins is extremely amazing in his role as Norman Bates. Perkin's performance isn't only Oscar-Worthy, it is also one of the greatest performances of all time. It is up there with Anthony Hopkins' role as Hannibal Lector in my book. Janet Leight and Vera Miles are also very good actresses, and fit the role of heroine in Psycho very well. The acting in Psycho doesn't seem dated at all.The suspense is also spectacular in Psycho. Alfred Hitchcock's brilliant directing and Bennard Herrman's chilling score work together to build up atmosphere and suspense for the film. This is done extremely well. Psycho may very well be one of the most suspenseful movies of all time. Another thing that helps with the amount of atmopshere of the movie is how real it looks and feels. Everything in this movie seems realistic to the viewer. You can relate to the people in the film, especially with the way the characters are developed.Psycho may very well be the flawless movie. It has everything to not only make it a great horror film, but a great film as well. Any horror fan should check out Psycho, simply because it set so many new levels in the genre. Any film fan in general should check out Psycho is well, simply because it is so well made. Psycho is a must view for everyone. A lot of the movies from the 50s and 60s seem very cheesy by today's standards of computer animation and slang talk. However, Psycho still fits in with the classics. This is because Alfred Hitchcock directed his movies for the audience, not for the critics. This is obviously why the critics responded terribly to it. There were very few positive reviews for Psycho by all of the huge film critics, yet it still ranks as the 21st greatest film ever made on the IMDb top list. Hitchcock was able to not only make this movie well, but he was also able to make it enjoyable.Psycho still ranks in with the HORROR classics as well. Perhaps this is due the way it inspired so many films to come after it. This may also be due the fact that Psycho plays with all of the fears that thrilled audiences just as much today as it did in 1960; The thrill of running from the police; The fear of run-down motels; The fear of strangers; The feel of taking showers alone; and of course The fear of our mother's rage.For more horror film reviews, check out my channel on youtube horrorreviews123 ","genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"29 June 2008","score":"","review":" I've always had problems with the title. The word indecent means immodest, obscene; unfit for society. When used these days, the word is almost invariably followed by exposure. Audacious Proposal would have made more sense.The premise is well-known by now, and presents opportunities to muse about the relevance of marital fidelity, personal scruples, and the seductive and emotional power of money, but it sidesteps, muddies or ignores every one of them. It could have addressed any or all of them and still be entertaining and a conversation starter.Billionaire John Gage (Robert Redford) offers one million dollars to a struggling couple, Diana and David Murphy (Demi Moore and Woody Harrelson), if he can sleep with her for one night. The proposal is intrepid, adventurous and bold, but it is not indecent. Diana accepts the offer and follows through with the assignation, all the while reminding David that she is doing it for him, to further his career as an architect. I suppose her oft-repeated declaration is meant to show us that yes Diana does too have scruples. See? she can call upon them whenever she wants to.Diana's tight-lipped and blithe insouciance once the tryst is history and the money is in the bank drives David out of his mind. Director Adrian Lyne wisely keeps Diana's and Gage's night on the yacht out of camera range. (Seeing the hideous gray dress he asks her to wear is enough.) It's too bad he didn't do the same with David's petulance, self-pity and masochism, which overshadows everything else in the second act. David is supposed to be a bright and promising architect whose marriage to Diana is solid as a rock. Of course, the only way we know this is through a lightning fast exposition of their courtship and marriage, told mostly through photos shot with a lens metaphorically coated in Vaseline. In Love Story, Jenny reminded Oliver many times that love means never having to say you're sorry. These two like to ask each other the equally inane, have I ever told you that I love you? When Demi Moore gives the best performance in a movie, that's saying something. Although Diana is an underwritten role, the character isn't maddeningly one-note like those of David and Gage. She is two-dimensional, which is as fleshed out as any Lyne character ever gets. Lyne is no more secure in his leading lady's acting abilities than most other directors, so he gives her the expected opportunities to show some skin. Sketchy roles never seem to allow Moore any freedom; she tends to hem herself in. But someone has to restrain themselves in the aftermath of Diana's night on the yacht. As noted, David has gone to pieces with rage and jealousy. Diana cannot deal with his meltdown; his suspicions, leading questions and accusations drive her away. Meanwhile, John Gage is waiting for Diana around every corner. He is essentially stalking her, but his behavior is supposed to come off as charming. When she, on the other hand -- with good reason -- crashes one of Gage's business luncheons, it's cause for alarm; Diana's behavior is inappropriate and unacceptable. This is a double standard Hollywood reinforces over and over again. But soon Diana puts up only token resistance to Gage's pursuit. She didn't when he offered her and David that lifetime of financial security with but one little catch.Diana eventually caves in, and she and Gage get busy making the social rounds. What they find to talk about is anyone's guess, but Moore and Redford do make for an attractive couple. The passage of time is indicated by David and Diana's both getting teaching jobs. He teaches architecture and suggests bricks are blessed with self-determination. I told you he went nuts after Diana slept with Gage. For her part, Diana teaches U.S. citizenship. Her pupils, all well into adulthood, giggle like 8-year-olds when Gage crashes the class to declare he's crazy about Diana. Even though she has divorced David, her days with Gage as an item at gala openings and silly charity functions are numbered. The time comes for Diana to go back to David, having learned what, exactly? Have I ever told you I loved you? Would we have been able to handle the million bucks any better if we'd earned it? The credits roll before they begin to figure this out.I want scriptwriters to STOP recycling Mr. Bernstein's anecdote about the girl on the Jersey ferry from Citizen Kane. Gage gets to give that little speech here, adapted for modern times. The problem is, the conclusion he wants Diana to draw from it is exactly the opposite of what he says.Indecent describes the amount of money the picture took in at the box office -- about $199,000.000 more worldwide than Gage offers the Murphys.

The camera shoots the feet of several people doing different dance steps while a catchy music plays on the back. There's a chance you miss the credits because the movement of the feet may distract you; I think that's effective. I also think the first ten minutes of the film are effective with the camera showing different views of what's clearly a small town and then taking us to church, where Reverend Moore (John Lithgow) gives a speech about how dancing corrupts the spirit of young children. When the mass is over, we see the Reverend's beautiful daughter Ariel (Lori Singer) and her friends in a car racing tough guy Chuck's van (Jim Youngs), and unexpectedly Ariel gets out of the car through the window and stands in the middle of the two vehicles, knowing that a truck is coming from the other side. She doesn't die, but we understand the movie makes a statement a girl is angry at her father because he is forbidding freedom among teenagers, and controls her all the time and doesn't let her live her life. This is not an unfamiliar plot line, and although it's interesting, the movie provides something more interesting yet Ren McCormack. Played by Kevin Bacon with the enough amount of cockiness and the necessary humanity, Ren is the new guy in this little town and he's about to bring trouble because he dances well and he wants everyone to dance. However, that's as interesting as it gets. I won't tell you anything else about the plot because I believe everybody needs to experience a film in their own way and draw their own conclusions, but I have to tell you that my experience of Footloose was a disappointing one. Yes, there's good music and choreographies, and Kevin Bacon's work is risky and worthy of admiration (so is Chris Penn's as his best friend Willard), but there's absolutely nothing more. As we wait for a new song to start playing, direct Herbet Ross struggles to keep our attention and cover the big holes in Dean Pitchford's script (there are moments where this is impossible and we're stuck with excessive minutes of background music). Take any conversation, any situation; only one is enough to see how narrow-minded Pitchford's writing is. And it's not narrow-minded because the characters inhabit a narrow-minded little town it's narrow-minded in its nature, and it makes it impossible to us to connect with any of the characters or even remember their names (try to remember the name of Ren's mother by the end of the movie). Matsan asked me one time about the name of a guy that appears a lot in the film, but it seems more an accessory than a character. After one day in school, Ren is driving the streets with a bunch of guys we don't care about. Okay, maybe we shouldn't, but the script's greatest fault is failing in the development of the one character we should at least relate to. If you think about an instant reason for Ren and his mother to be in a new town, you won't find it. And the movie provides reasons for this situation and many others, but it does it during the wrong moments. Every time an honest confession comes out of a character's mouth, we're not ready for it and we're not able to fully digest it. I felt there was a problem of connection between each scene; that everything was either moving too fast or moving in an unexpected way, like the confession. Sometimes the unexpected is good not here. You see&#133;Satine had feelings, she was trapped in a situation and we felt for her (this is Moulin Rouge!); Roxie Hart had aspirations, dreams (this is Chicago). Ren McCormack apparently has all this things too, but when the film gives him the possibility to stand by them, two times; the first one he's not convincing enough and the second one the movie skips the scene. Of course you could say it's a musical and the story is less important and not to be taken seriously and other things, and that's why I put the examples above; but this is partly.

I also rather enjoyed the enterprise music video\/Trekkie fetish orgasm educing Kirk approaching the star ship bit. In all fairness I will conclude that it is impossible for me to see this film in its original context ( the relaunching on the big screen of a canceled cult T.V. series) All I see is the predecessor of what would inevitably turn out to be not only one of the best sequels of all time but arguably one of the greatest genre films ever.

Here is a film that covers and raises so many points and issues, and does so in a very grand and atmospheric manner. If director Joseph L. Mankiewicz was trying to raise points and debate surrounding Hollywood; the need for greed; that lust for being famous and the transition or rivalry between theatre and cinema then All About Eve can only be attributed to being an epic success.The primary reason this feels so fresh and the one manner in which you can read into All About Eve stems from the fact that whatever points Mankiewicz raises, they are still apparent here and now in our time. The film covers the life and certain times of higher-ups in the American entertainment industry, circa the late 1940s and early 1950s. We get all sorts of characters and various different view points revolving around the sole theme that greed, good looks and good stardom will see you through. The opening voice over is by that of Addison DeWitt, played by George Sanders. He is a critic of the theatre and goes around a room during an awards ceremony, pointing each person out. We are initially presented with this viewpoint of a critic; the smartest and eldest character in the film but the point of view quickly changes hands as the film wears on, giving us a rounded and fair perspective of the themes and events Mankiewicz will raise.So All About Eve is a tale of stardom; a rise through the ranks. It is a morality tale of how to act, how not to act and uncovers the mentality behind it all. Eve is played by Anne Baxter, she has an encounter with established actress of the stage Margo (Davis) and ends up in the dressing room full of mouthy servants; glamorous actresses and their equally handsome male partners &#150; it is a large utopia within a very small room for Eve. Then there is the gradual obsession the film builds on regarding Eve and her idol Margo. Eve does not look at Margo, she gazes and the shot construction suggests so. Eve is willing to go not only the extra mile for Margo but just a little further, setting up phone calls and making her breakfast without any prior mentioning. Eve refers to Margo as 'mistress' and the film piles on all the necessary scenes that presume us to think she is a stalker what with her attending all the plays over and over.In fact the film is very tempting in its early establishment of these character conventions that it takes Margo's lover away from her. He must travel off on a train to Hollywood for more work, sort of paving the way for Eve to fill the space left empty by the male. But when the film unfolds and it appears the deeper issues are beginning to make themselves known, the themes of greed and disgust at the greed float to the surface. When a revelation involving Eve is made apparent, it seems that the lust for one certain female star was so great that Eve would stop at nothing to get to where she wants to be. This is where the themes can be applied to nowadays. Young girls even now are looking at pictures of female actresses, envying the faces; the build and the fashion statements. So much so that the line between being a 'fan' of someone and being obsessed by them becomes blurred and ambiguous in its retrospect.There can be no doubt that these days you do not need to have done much to be famous, not least in America in which All About Eve was also produced via and set. Starring in your own pornographic film; winning a reality TV programme; having the natural looks and physique as well as being in connection with a famous brand name are all sure fire ways to get noticed or famous &#150; none of which require effort or intelligence and it is these people that we have younger people obsess over. It is a similar thing in All About Eve; an actress is huge in the theatre and garners a cult following &#150; but one fan is mad enough to take it to the next level that they will lie and deceit their way to fame. Now, it is this ideation that in order to become 'someone' you do not particularly have to do 'anything'; something Mankiewicz touches on in this film when a lot of talking and soppy sounding stories get you 'into' a clique.There is a sad irony behind Marilyn Monroe playing Miss Casswell because she is really just playing herself. Additionally, there is a sad irony behind three of the cast being victims of suicide in years to come Sanders who plays the critic; Barbara Bates who plays Phoebe (who adopts the role of 'Eve' when 'Eve' becomes 'Margo') and of course Monroe herself. All victims of stardom? All victims of their own success? It is still happening today with Hollywood stars not being able to take the weight and escapism through drugs doesn't help either. So greed and obsession with success is the theme people wear 'Hollywood fur' even when they do not need it and when the show 'must go on', it is corrected as No, Margo must go on. In Hollywood's 'golden age' of production, here is a film with themes that could well still count for today's era.

There is a legend going around that, even if it's not true, is fun to believe- that the star, director, and even the writer were uncertain about whether one of the deaths in the film was a suicide or murder, and if it was a murder, who committed it. After seeing 'The Big Sleep,' I am inclined to believe it. Unless you almost literally take notes while watching it, after a certain point your brain just stops trying to keep track of all the persons seen or referred to, on screen and off, who killed whom and who is getting the blame and where the hell Sean Regan is. There are three people that you end up caring about- Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart), Vivian (Lauren Bacall), and Vivian's younger sister Carmen (Martha Vickers). Carmen is an example of an enduring cinematic character type that lives on to this day, the drop-dead gorgeous young woman who is absolutely out of control and doesn't give a damn about anything but having a good time. This being 1946, her personality is drawn mainly by suggestion, and suggestive lines, and Vickers' wickedly suggestive performance. It is said some of her scenes were cut to build up Bacall's part. If that's true, it's a shame. But then 'The Big Sleep' is a pretty naughty film overall for its time. There's Bogart and Bacall's famous conversation with the 'racehorse' analogy, which probably pushed the envelope as far as it would go back then. The film is heavy on dialogue, not so much on action, but you don't really notice it. An air of threatening cold-bloodedness hangs over the proceedings, the feeling that life is cheap and anyone might be killed at any moment on someone else's whim. In this way, it can be seen as a very early precursor to a film like 'Blue Velvet.' When Marlowe walks into a house to find Carmen stoned and completely out of it, one gets the same feeling about the crowd she's been hanging out with that you did in the David Lynch film, where Dennis Hopper casually kidnaps and torments Kyle McLachlan. Bogart of course is perfect as Marlowe; at this stage in his career, he had the hardboiled private eye bit nailed. Lauren Bacall builds on her performance in 'To Have And Have Not' as the brainy and sexy femme fatale who sometimes is too clever for her own good. Martha Vickers is a knockout as the 'nymphy' younger sister. Her constant flirting with Marlowe prompts his classic line, She tried to sit in my lap while I was standing up. The rest of the cast is standard issue, the usual Warner Bros. stock company of character actors, with one exception- a very young Dorothy Malone portrays a sexy bookworm with whom Marlowe has a rainy day tryst. She makes the most of her scene. 'The Big Sleep' is one of those films that you can watch again and again and always pick up something new from, an example of old-time Hollywood at its most riskily and racily adventurous.

By that time, they were well into the film, perhaps more than half way through, but I watched the rest. I'm not exactly sure how much I liked it at the time, but didn't see anything severely wrong with it. Last night, I watched the whole movie for the first time. Knowing it wasn't the most widely praised film, and that I have higher standards than I did six years ago, I had fairly low expectations, but after that, I can't say I dislike it.A very complex code called Mercury has been created by the NSA, one which is believed to be impossible to break. However, the code has been put in a puzzle magazine as a test to see if this is true, and a nine year old autistic boy in Chicago named Simon Lynch, who likes to solve puzzles, manages to break it. The NSA receives a call from this boy, and the two agents who have received the call inform their boss, Nicholas Kudrow. Kudrow is afraid of the code being spread around, so he sends an assassin to kill the boy! The assassin comes to Simon's house and kills his parents, but cannot find the boy himself, and flees when he hears the police coming! An FBI agent named Art Jeffries is sent to investigate, and he finds Simon hiding in a closet. After taking the boy away, Art must protect him and try to keep him from the assassins, which will be difficult, as he doesn't have too many people on his side, and keeping Simon in one place in sometimes a challenge! I'm not sure exactly how to explain my feelings about this movie. Around the beginning, it seemed pretty much average, but it gradually got better. I was pretty shocked at the scene where Simon's parents are killed, and not in a good way. Some (probably many) people have criticised Mercury Rising for being so unrealistic and clichéd, and I'm not going to argue with that, but I can't say I think it's a bad movie. As usual, Bruce Willis puts on a memorable performance, this time as FBI agent Art Jeffries, a likable character, and then-child actor Miko Hughes is also impressive as Simon. Playing the role of an autistic character probably wasn't easy, but it seems Hughes managed to pull it off. For me, it was reasonably suspenseful seeing the two characters on the run together. The film has very memorable and touching ending as well, one which I remembered from the first time.No, this certainly isn't the most popular action thriller ever made, nor does it deserve to be, but worse has been done. I honestly thought I would have more critical things to say about Mercury Rising, but I don't, and it seems many of those who don't like it have given good reasons why they don't, probably better reasons than I can give for praising it. Since this 1998 action thriller is so polarizing, I guess there's no guarantee whether you'll like it or not, unless you don't like action thrillers in general, then you obviously wouldn't like it. However, if you're a fan of this genre, (you like good, though maybe mindless action), there's a chance Mercury Rising will do, as long as you're not expecting a masterpiece.

Sure sometimes he looked a little robotic but that's what happens when you're DIRECTED.This movie shows all sorts of truths about the everyday man that sometimes, I feel like anyone could be the mad killer. Anyone could suddenly walk up and shoot an old lady in the chest or start a killing spree just because they felt like killing. We're so very weak yet we're so very strong. We're given all the tools to be judge and guilty.I found myself looking at the protagonist as some kind of hero, up until the end of the movie, where I found it almost cruel to see that all of this had been but in his mind. The girl opening up his note book seemed indication enough that this all had been nothing but Bateman's subconscious hacking at his mind. Driving him crazy with thoughts of mutilating women and using them as his sex slaves.Then again, this is maybe what a hero is. That's all a hero could be in our time where anything is brought up as a grand event. From the slightest birth to the worse death. Everything is preached, even the serial killers are preached at some point. This is why this movie is so effective People end up wanting to see him kill people. Hell, when I heard the movie was about a guy just killing people because he felt like it, I wanted to see it.It's such a beautiful way to end this kind of fantastical adventure by telling you Wouldn't you just like that? To think he's killed all these people and got away with it? I think even though I haven't spoken of the movie much, you should see it. It's a must for anyone having personal doubts about how well our society is currently built.I'm a Canadian and I still was able to see the references to the American dream depicted within this movie. I paid more attention to how well the whole thing rolled, up till the credits I was on the edge of my seat, always wanting to see more.A let-down some might say? I think it was more like a slap to the face.

One commenter defies anyone to be able to explain all parts or scenes of this film, and I would take that challenge. It is not all that difficult when viewed as imagined events interspersed with reality, and as an exploration of an emotionally ill mind. A viewing of the film from beginning to end is necessary however.While not my favorite Lynch film, it's so much better than most drivel out of Hollywood that it is highly recommended viewing, and will captivate the viewer such that the running time is barely noticeable. It is the type of film that ends and yet you wish it hadn't. Of particular note is a marvelous rendition of Roy Orbison's 'Crying' by a female singer.

The script is thee best I've ever read. The direction is flawless. The acting may very well have the best ensemble cast in any movie I've ever seen or will ever see. It's also one of the most precise and intricate films I've ever come across as writer, Mario Puzo brings out some of the most hidden and guarded secrets of the underground world ever captured on film. Watching The Godfather, is like watching cinematic art. Francis Ford Coppola's direction is what brings this film, that's so ambitious and so grand, down to earth with precision direction as he handles each and every scene with such care. The film starts with a black screen and an opening monologue from an undertaker. As the man starts talking about honor, family, respect, and justice we are pulled right in on his luminous eyes as he stands in near darkness. He begs for justice since the American system has failed him. He goes to Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) for justice. Don Vito is the man of power. He's the one who pulls all the strings and watches his puppets dance from behind the stage and out of sight; untouchable, or so we think. Some of the greatest moments in the film- and very intentional to show the distinguishable difference between Michael and Vito- are of Vito crying over his son, Sonny's (James Caan), death. When Michael learns of the news, he has little reaction. Two of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the film are from the cause of a loved one that has died long before he should have, and they come from Brando. As Vito stands over the body of his son he nearly breaks down. There is clash of feelings between the two men that are never conflicting, but compared. The film opens during the wedding of Don Vito' daughter, Connie (Talia Shire), and we see just how strong the bond of family really is. You have the family dancing with each other, drinking, laughing, and sitting next to each other to show how close they are, then we see some of the outsiders such as the Barzini family, and surprisingly Michael (Al Pacino) along with his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) on the outskirts without much interaction. Michael seems almost out of place as if he is the adopted son and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is more apart of the family than he is. His opening words are to Kay, and they include, That's my family, Kay. That's not me. We get the feeling that Michael's nearly ashamed of the stigma that goes along with his last name This is what makes Al Pacino' role- significantly- the hardest performance in the entire film to portray. He's the one doing all the heavy lifting as he has to go from outsider and completely against the family's actions and businesses to, by films end, head of the family. Brando has the teary eyed moments that actors live for, but Michael is too cold for that. Never for a second as he gradually comes to power do we think this turn is ridiculous or laughable, and in lesser hands it very easily could have been. The final act of the film is loaded with plot points as decisions are made left and right as the film becomes visually and emotionally captivating. As the film draws to an end, Michael has gained half of the power of the family and makes most of the decisions. He's treated, not with respect, but as an outsider, too high ranking for his experience. The Corleone family is on the brink of disaster and losing everything, yet we never get that feeling. We see the two leader's confidence and we keep our confidence in them, even if the other family members doubt their decisions. Michael goes to Las Vegas and makes Moe Greene an offer he can't refuse. Then he refuses. This is Pacino' shinning moment in the film. There's no screaming or the hoopla that goes along with his name. After he treats Moe Greene like utter garbage, Fredo (John Cazale) get's upset and starts barking at him. Coppola is perfectly on his game here, too, as we watch from Fredo's height, looking down on Michael who sits in a chair as he coldly looks up with his radiating eyes, that have so much going on behind them, and simply says, Fredo, don't ever take sides with anyone against family again. Ever.That's some serious foreshadowing for the second film, and only after watching the second film can you go back and appreciate what Pacino and Coppola pulled off in this scene; Cazale too. We have no idea how serious Michael is. These are some of the stepping stones that make Michael's change believable. He's not quite his father- Vito has a soft spot for his children (admittedly so)- as he's capable of turning on anyone and using the line, It's strictly business when it comes to family issues. Michael's sister, Connie, calls him a cold hearted bastard at the end of the film. It's hard to find better superlatives than that, yet we still love him. The interesting thing about Pacino' performance is that he doesn't sugarcoat it. He doesn't try to make the audience love him. He plays the character as the character should be played. That's the sign of great writing; great acting; and great directing since we could have very easily seen someone try to make him likable. This crew just presents the character with all his flaws and let's us decide if we love him or hate him. Its films like The Godfather, that made me wish I had amnesia, so I could feel the same heart pounding moments over and over again.
