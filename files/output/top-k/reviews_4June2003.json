However, Young Sherlock Holmes is definitely not as good as the other film.  It did not seem very well researched.  (I know it's a bit of a what if story, but it relied on the image of Hollywood Holmes rather than the one presented in canon). On the whole, I was very disappointed, especially since I noticed Spielberg's name during the opening credits.*Beware!  There be spoilers ahead!*So the whole plot is based around an Egyptian cult that likes to shoot people with hallucinaginic darts.  I'm sure that happened all the time in Victorian London.  But we're not looking for realism here, are we?  This is the action movie version of Sherlock Holmes that doesn't allow any room for good old-fashioned logic.Something I caught on to early on was the fact that Holmes' lady love Elizabeth was destined to meet a sad end before the film ended. Obviously, her death would explain why the older Holmes was never enticed by any woman. His heart had long ago been taken.  That thought alone made me want to puke.  And by the way, what was that stuff about Holmes staying with her after he got kicked out of school?  I really wanted to see how Mycroft and Sherlock got on together, but I guess Elizabeth offered far more than Mycroft ever could ;-)Did anybody else think Watson looked a bit like a plumper version of Harry Potter?  (Speaking of which, Chris Columbus actually wrote this thing!  I hope he doesn't claim to be a real Holmes fan.)  Watson was definitely the Hollywood version of his character.  He was an idiot whose greatest joy was overeating.  Although, he did get his shining moment when he saved Elizabeth and Holmes by using a single rope with hook at the end.  That's the only time I thought he had any brains at all.  Oh, and there are tons of references to his wanting to go to medical school.  Hmmm...I wonder what he'll grow up to be.The special effects are pretty...special.  Let's just say that the opening bit (where the man thinks his dinner is attacking him) made me laugh out loud.  In fact, the memory of it still makes me chuckle.  The effects are dated and, in my opinion, pretty cheesy.  But I must admit I liked the knight that came out of the stained glass window.  The reversed picture of his face on his back was a cute touch.  (Again, not the reaction the film was going for.)The villian was a definite letdown.  He was quite obviously a bad guy from the beginning since he was nice to Holmes and did not have his life threatened because of it.  But the touch at the end of the film where he changes his name to Moriarty was nice.  Almost makes you think they actually care about the canon Holmes.  Almost.But the thing that really took the cake was the horrible battle between Holmes and Moriarty\/Rathe\/Ethar\/Who Cares What His Real Name Is Anyway. It was clear that the bad guy was going to end up breaking through the ice of the Thames since they had bothered to show us that the ice was quite precarious by crashing that stupid flying device in to it.I would definitely recommend missing this movie.  If you're dying to see a different interpretation of Sherlock Holmes, then rent Without a Clue. It's very funny and well researched and has good acting.  Of course, you could always read some of Doyle's stories.  A Study in Scarlet will tell you the proper way Holmes and Watson first met.

By that point, however, we're almost out of time for the movie, so the remaining three quarters of the book has to be summed up via voice-overs and a rather contrived ending scene which does not bear many similarities to the book.

It seems the things people attack in it are things they do not have a background in. The medieval warfare plot is present in the film, because Vlad Dracula was a very real prince in the 15th century Wallachian state bordering Transylvania. In fact, the opening scene is depicted action for action with what happened historically, save for the blood gushing from the cross of course. Bram Stoker drew upon this historical character to drive his novel, for all the baggage such a figure would bring to the plate.   As for the rest of the film, the look and style is very rooted in the Symbolist style of the period. In fact, many, many images in the film directly copy well-known Symbolist paintings to a tee. When the dreamy Symbolist style was not being employed, previous incarnations of Dracula on film are referenced. The independent shadow you mention was used in the first Dracula film, Nosferatu (1922). The special-effects employed were all limited to what was available to filmmaking at the time the novel takes place, using puppets, scrims, double-processing, et cetera.    The use of absinthe and filmmaking (two great diversions of Stoker's day), were employed to draw up a parallel between themselves and vampirism. I am not going to go into detail how filmmaking parallels it here, but if you are wondering, go watch Shadow of the Vampire for a detailed example. Absinthe drew many under its dreamlike catatonic spell, and as a result of its potency at the time, destroyed many lives, despite its allure.

This helps the film have more leverage on the imaginations of its audience.  All the songs are usually sung onstage, but still reflect an aspect of story telling.

Undoubtedly some of it is merited, but much of it is unfair. Firstly, for it's first hour Independence Day is excellent. It comes closer than any other film to showing what the reality of massive alien ships suddenly turning up would actually be like (a mixture of mass panic and euphoria) while at the same time plays like a military technothriller, with lots of tense scenes in command centres, submarines and the White House. The shots of the alien craft arriving over New York, Washington and LA are hugely impressive and ominous, while the frequent use of TV news broadcasts lends the whole thing an air of believability (for more of this check out the 10 minute mockumentary on the DVD). Also, a great sense of tension is built up by Jeff Goldblum's character's discovery of the countdown signal.The payoff of all of this is the second reason the film is worth a look, namely some of the most impressive visual effects you are ever likely to see.

The Cornwall locations are absolutely enchanting; showing an England so far from the urban norm these days. The beautiful natural light, with later dark contrasts, perfectly complements the jovial, winning mood of this Shakespeare comedy brought to screen and, what is more, this is truly beyond any sense of 'heritage cinema', as Shakespeare's genius is retained.Yes, it is all a very 'accessible' package, but much is unusual and distinctive to this film adaptation. Ben Kinglsey is perhaps the most glaring instance of a radical re-invisioning; his acting - stripped bare of artifice - is utterly compelling and keeps you watching his every mannerism. This Feste is an eccentric, multi-talented clown and performer, but he also bears words of cutting, melancholy truth. Indeed, both are wonderfully combined with the gorgeously sad scene of Staunton, Grant and Smith listening to his sad song they listen and the words cut into their veneers. Loneliness is at their very core. What a brilliantly rounded comedy this is; balanced by melancholy - the inch-perfect awry note struck by Hawthorne's Malvolio appearing at the end - and good will - the comradely bonhomie that Grant and Smith are indeed shown to share.Hawthorne and perhaps more surprisingly Mel Smith and Richard E. Grant really do a fine job and imbuing some real character in their parts; treading a line between broad comedic playing and human sadness. Along with Kingsley's career-best (? not seen too many of his films) performance, they lend this film its heart, and play very well against the wonderful settings. Mackintosh and Stubbs are I guess a little less compelling, but these roles are really difficult to carry off... nothing about them really lingers too long in the memory, like Kingsley's expressions, bizarre little pieces of dance and his pared-down delivery. Helena Bonham Carter is perhaps overly assured as the vain countess dame, Olivia oh so archly bemused when faced by the cross-gartered, prancing Hawthorne, but generally Ms. Bonham Carter is very much in her usual, predictably petulant, period-costume mode. Which is probably being unfair; she does convince, at the end of the day.Overall then, a wonderfully colourful delight, bearing the flavour of bright, melancholy late summer-into-autumn. A strange chill is cast by the compelling Kinglsey; a sadness that cannot be dispelled. This film has light amusement in addition to this real edge, and is ultimately a very affecting rendering of a bona fide Shakesperean classic.

The photography is very stylized, it shows the energetic beauty of an industrial landscape (discovered later by the advertising industry), supported by a breathtakingly good musical score. Color and wardrobe are carefully balanced, bright yellows and blues set the aesthetic basis. The actors, so it seems, were kept on a very short leash. They are often not much more than an ornament, they move little and are not only prisoners of the story but of the way Schrader transforms the story into pictures. This becomes agonizingly clear in the paint-job-murder-scene, a long, climactic incident with high symbolic meaning. It really lacks credibility and apparently leaves Yaphet Kotto, who plays the victim, clueless.

This is definitely not a seventies version of Jules Dassin's Brute Force or Elia Kazan's On The Waterfront. There is no clear cut separation between us and them, the essence of any kind of political propaganda. All characters are helpless puppets. Schrader pulls the strings.The way this movie was filmed shows clearly that social realism was not the aim of its director. The photography is very stylized, it shows the energetic beauty of an industrial landscape (discovered later by the advertising industry), supported by a breathtakingly good musical score. Color and wardrobe are carefully balanced, bright yellows and blues set the aesthetic basis. The actors, so it seems, were kept on a very short leash. They are often not much more than an ornament, they move little and are not only prisoners of the story but of the way Schrader transforms the story into pictures. This becomes agonizingly clear in the paint-job-murder-scene, a long, climactic incident with high symbolic meaning. It really lacks credibility and apparently leaves Yaphet Kotto, who plays the victim, clueless. Richard Pryor (wearing painfully tight pants!) occasionally breaks out and delivers a few good lines that must definitely be his, not Schrader's.Schrader used (some may even say abused) the Rust Belt for his own purposes, it is just amazing that an auteur could make this technically brilliant high quality picture which is hard to understand and certainly does not appeal to many.

I, like many before me who have critiqued this move on IMDB, would agree that this movie was extremely underrarted and overlooked. Now I'll grant that this movie came out the same year as movies like American Beauty, Fight Club, The Matrix, The Sixth Sense, Magnolia and an endless list of other excellent movies (at least, I can definitely vouch for the first three movies) but still, this movie was comparable to those flicks and deserved at least a few Oscar nominations.  It also didn't help that it came out not to far after the like of the more overrated (though still very excellent) war-dramas, ie-Saving Private Ryan and Thin Red Line, but still this movie deserved much better marketing and better acclaim. *SPOILERS MAY OCCUR. JUST DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU!* To give a brief plot synopsis, the movie is set during March,1991. Of course the Gulf War has just officially ended. The United States has achieved it objective of liberating Kuwait from the control of Iraq, but has signed a cease-fire agreement with the latter, leaving the now liberated Kuwaitis to fend for themselves against Sadaam and his Republican Guard. The main characters of the movie are Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg in an excellent and sometimes heartfelt performance) who just recently became a father, Vig. Conrad, Troy's boisterous and somewhat gun-happy best friend (Spike Jonze, whose performance provides some of the more comical moments of the movie), the cautious and more reserved Chief Elgin (the surprisingly good Ice Cube) who initially can't stand Conrad, and the soon-to-retire Major Archie Gates (the very under-rated George Clooney). Our four heroes have stumbled upon a map that could lead to some bunkers full of Kuwaiti bullion (gold, essentially) stolen by Sadaam's soldiers. They subsequently decide to set off on this journey completely driven by their own self-serving interests and grandiose dreams of wealth and material indulgence. They finally get to the village where the gold is stored. They notice that the villagers are being tortured and starved by Sadaam's troops in a bid to force their allegiance. At first the four soldiers ignore the chaos and proceed with necessity as usual. Necessity suddenly changes when the four Americans witness a brutal murder by one of Sadaam's troops. The four decide to stay behind and help the villagers. What follows is a tale of transformation and sacrifice.  Besides the excellent plot, one thing that I really liked about this movie was its skillful and unique (albeit, sometimes uneven) combination of all the action, drama, emotion and intense violence of an excellent war movie with the razor-sharp wit of a wickedly-funny dark comedy. This trait by itself catapults this movies far apart from most of the war movies that have come out recently. This, by itself, should have turned some heads at the Oscars. To add this, the visual techniques used in the movie were perfect (I especially loved visuals used to show what happens with a gunshot wound) and should have been nominated as well. The dialogue and the chemistry between the main charatcers was also played to perfection. Jaime Kennedy is perfect in a supporting role as the goofy and somewhat inept private Walter Wogaman who has to stall an over-ambitious reporter Adriana Cruz (Nora Dunn) from following the four soldiers   Beside being an excellent action-comedy\/war-drama, this movie was also a very brilliant satire. It had much to say about the selfishness of man, the pushiness of American media and the way we're seen by other countries. In one scene, we hear an Iraqi soldier use Michael Jackson as an example of how Americans make black people feel inferior and to wish that they were white. Even the main plot of the movie could suggest satire. We see these four American soldiers on this selfish quest for gold suddenly turned into a group of people fighting for a cause that is greater and more valuable than the riches that they seek. We also see the example of the reporter who is so driven by her desire to capture that great story that she would willingly risk her life for it.  Now as to why the title of the movie is called Three Kings as opposed to Four, well, without giving much away, one of them does die at the end. Despite this tragic part of the movie and some other equal tragic moments, this movie is definitely worth your time and money.

The writing was atrocious, the acting horrid, and the whole execution of the project a complete shambles.  It's bad enough when you take a bad tv series and make a piece of drek, like Charlie's Angels; but, when you take a great series like The Wild, Wild West and turn it into this mess, it should be criminal.Everything about this movie is a failure.  I don't have a fundamental problem with Will Smith's race, had a better rationale for his character being a government agent been presented.  Unfortunately, not much thought was put into that aspect and race only becomes an issue when it can be used for bad jokes and cliched plot points.  Kevin Kline could have been a good Artemus Gordon, had the script given him anything to work with.  I'm completely convinced that Kenneth Brannagh can't handle anything not written by Shakespeare, and not always that.There's no chemistry in this film, the jokes are lame at best and offensive at worst.  The plot, what there is of it, is weak; and that stupid spider just doesn't work.  A spider machine could have worked had greater care been taken, but this just screams crapola.  Anyone who has seen An Evening with Kevin Smith or has heard his story about his Superman script, knows who bears sole blame for the giant spider.  And whose stupid idea was it to change Dr Loveless from a cultured, but demented dwarf to an annoying redneck?  That person should have to build and maintain a shrine to Michael Dunn as penance.Anyone who is thinking of renting or, god forbid, buying this movie, don't! Pick up anything else or read a book; just skip this movie.  We don't want to encourage any more films like this.  Better yet, seek out and watch episodes of the original tv show.
