[{"date":"3 June 2011","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This is a late movie that seems to have been made in the vein of the screwball comedy genre, which was at its peak during the '30's and '40's. Now, screwball movies just never have been among my favorite ones, so this movie also really isn't.Probably most amazing thing about this movie is that's directed by Frank Capra. His touch is however nowhere to be found in this movie, even though he had worked on lots of comedies and the screwball genre before, prior to this movie. I think the foremost problem is that the movie doesn't try to be just a comedy but also a serious and heavy drama. The two things aren't that well balanced out within this movie and because of this both elements fall sort of flat.The story and characters also just aren't that appealing in my opinion. You don't ever really connect emotionally to any of the characters because they are doing some very stupid and also irresponsible things throughout the movie. This is especially a problem with the main character, played by Frank Sinatra.No, even despite its really solid cast the characters just don't work out too well. Edward G. Robinson's and Thelma Ritter's talent all goes to waste in this movie and they are two of my favorite actors actually.It's also a movie that is (too) heavy on its talking. This gives away that the movie is based on a stage-play. Seriously, they should had really cut some of the dialog and add in some more comical moments, to make this movie at least more entertaining to follow. The movie is OK for about its first 30 minutes but after that you soon start to get tired of all characters sitting around and talking to each other, expressing their emotions and feelings and you'll most likely start to loose interest in this movie after a while, just like I did.It's not the most horrible movie you'll ever see but I can't think of any reason either why you should ever watch this movie in the first place. Perhaps just for Sinatra's musical moment, when he sings 'High Hopes', which also actually earned this movie an Oscar.6\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"3 June 2011","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This is a late movie that seems to have been made in the vein of the screwball comedy genre, which was at its peak during the '30's and '40's.

The movie has its charms, it has some very good moments. But there's a bit of a disjointed feel to it. You have the good bits but when you toss them all together you're left with the sense that the movie is lacking something in between. The pieces just don't fit properly, and some of the pieces seem to be missing altogether. Judy Garland is, as you would expect, excellent but she doesn't seem to have quite enough help. One great star isn't enough to make this movie really shine.The story follows the Smith family of St. Louis in the months leading up to that city's 1904 World's Fair. It's the biggest thing to ever hit St. Louis and everyone is so excited. Well the kids are anyway, it seems the adults could take it or leave it. There are four daughters and one rather irrelevant to the proceedings son in the Smith family. Garland plays the second eldest of the four Smith girls, Esther. She's in love with the boy next door although as the film opens she hasn't even met the guy. The oldest sister, Rose, has a romantic storyline of her own while the two younger girls, Agnes and Tootie, are there primarily to engage in shenanigans. But of course Garland is this movie's big star so it's no surprise her character of Esther is the main focus. Garland gives a very good, very charming performance and has a few memorable songs too. For as much as you appreciate the movie's great star there is at times though that nagging sense that the movie really isn't working as well as it should.It's a movie in which the first half works better than the second. The setup is better than the payoff. Almost all of the musical numbers are jammed into the first half of the film. Later on, when you're looking for a song to perk things up you're out of luck. The one big song late on in the film, the now oh so familiar Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, is terrific and beautifully performed by Garland. But for as wonderful and poignant as that song is energetic it is not. The lively songs all come and go too quickly for the movie's own good. And those songs are hit and miss anyway. The Trolley Song really works. The title song though sticks in your head more as an annoyance than a pleasure. And even when something works it seems the movie has no idea how to follow it. The Trolley Song sequence is great but as soon as it ends we jump forward months ahead in time to a Halloween sequence which, in the grand scheme of the movie, seems rather out of place, quite pointless. Hadn't that trolley been going somewhere? In fact it had, but the scene that should have been there, with its accompanying musical number, was cut. Which makes it rather jarring when at the end of the film a character refers back to that scene, the one we never saw. Just the clearest example of how disjointed this movie is. A bunch of pieces, some good, some adequate, some disappointing were thrown together and the end result doesn't quite satisfy. It's not a bad movie by any means and well worth watching for Garland if nothing else. But after a promising first half of the picture the film's energy seems to slowly drain away. There's no doubt the pieces were there to make a better movie than this. But in this case those pieces never managed to be put together as well as you would hope.

A loser is a loser &#x85; with an inner beauty in the ferocious attachment to get off his sordid condition despite an adversity conducted by his self-pity. That's the only department in which a loser can shine &#x85; a loser is only a failure with a promotion. I watched the film after learning that it had influenced Martin Scorsese, one of my favorite directors, and frankly, I couldn't believe a movie from 1945 would touch such a sensitive nerve in me. But it did, Scarlett Street, the remake of Jean Renoir's La Chienne -a movie I should see too- is a particularly affecting film-noir, depicting the descent into madness of a man in middle-age crisis, consumed by a profound desire to be loved by a younger woman.This is film-noir, you know, no Capra's romance, a cheap doll like Katherine March alias 'Kitty', the volcanic and torrid Joan Bennett can't fall in love with a lower-than-average Joe, Christopher 'Chris' Cross, a modest bank cashier, remarkably played by the great Edward G. Robinson &#x85; so blinded by his complex he can't realize she's using him. She's her life filler, but he's her pocket filler &#x85; Chris obviously didn't live enough experience to realize that girls in the real world love to be overpowered, and that there's no place in this cynical world for pure and sentimental hearts like his. But this is the sad reverse of his artistic side. As an amateur painter, Chris injected all his energy and talent into that passion to transcend his miserable condition of a likable clerk constantly belittled by a bullying wife. Chris has an admirable sensibility, but his life is so pathetic on the surface, he couldn't even measure the extent of his talent, not even sign his own creations, a fault that would use Kitty to take all the recognition, encouraged by Johnny, the man she 'loves'.And the movie is so cynically lucid, that it doesn't allow Chris to be upset by that even when he realizes the fraud, he forgives. I thought it was because of his talent's recognition but no, he just wanted to share his happiness with her, like a marriage, the ultimate self-disrespectful man not realizing that he signed the death warrant of his soul through this attitude. I couldn't help but feeling angry toward Chris, until I realized that something in this character spoke to me. Sometimes, we can't afford to raise our head and face adversity, and the least we do is to admit our weaknesses, as to give an excuse for the world to ignore us, being ignored is still the best way not to be hurt &#x85; cowardice disguised in realism. Film-noir is a fascinating genre so it can translate the lowest and darkest sides of our personalities into powerful (inter)actions and Fritz Lang's Scarlett Street is so dark it's blinding.The greatness of this film relies essentially on the characters. The acting is the driving force with basically, three protagonists who form one of the most pathetically fascinating love triangles ever. Chris loves Kitty because she makes him feel desired and loved, like meaning something to someone, unlike his hateful wife, married for some obscure interest reasons. Because, men in self-pity can only live through the eyes of other people, that's their tragedy. But Kitty only prostitutes herself and shares the gain with her pimp of a lover, Johnny, played by the inimitable Dan Dureya, this actor I already hated as the snotty spoiled kid in the Little Foxes, and that I hated even more now. And even at the end, his relationship with Kitty was quite ambiguous. I can't count how many times he slapped and insulted her, but I guess Kitty was aroused by such a manly attitude.

Chris loves Kitty because she makes him feel desired and loved, like meaning something to someone, unlike his hateful wife, married for some obscure interest reasons. Because, men in self-pity can only live through the eyes of other people, that's their tragedy. But Kitty only prostitutes herself and shares the gain with her pimp of a lover, Johnny, played by the inimitable Dan Dureya, this actor I already hated as the snotty spoiled kid in the Little Foxes, and that I hated even more now. And even at the end, his relationship with Kitty was quite ambiguous. I can't count how many times he slapped and insulted her, but I guess Kitty was aroused by such a manly attitude.

American director Robert Zemeckis' 1988 film is a deliriously enjoyable noir in its most extremest of forms; a hardened example of cross pollination, further still feeding off of decades of inspiration and homage, just cascading together into something else totally out of the ordinary alá Sin City or Blade Runner, as decidedly postmodern generic fabrications thrust together. Despite the hallmarks of creativity, the film is never preoccupied with its hook; going on to formulate an impressive and really quite affecting character study in amidst a narrative that is challenging; never overbearing and never thinks of its audience as idiots.The film follows a lowly, dishevelled private investigator named Eddie Valiant (Hoskins); a man living off of the reputation he has in solving mysteries that he did so effectively in the days during which his now deceased brother was still alive and working with him. The film wastes little time in constructing Valiant as the embittered lead he is, the hitching of unpaid rides on the rear carts of trams to get around town and the swigging of hard alcohol straight out of the bottle at whatever chance he gets when alone the norm; whereas down at a local bar, a one-time relationship with a waitress that might have gone somewhere, but has now mutated into that of quick acquaintances, the closest he has to a friend. By night, we see him attend an upmarket club that is putting on a comedy double act &#x96; where everyone else sees the funny side, Valiant is too indebted to his cynicism to even break a smile.Valiant is a living embodiment of a generic convention if ever there was one, but played with the sorts of creativity and wonder operating around him so much so that we enjoy seeing this familiarised core archetype at the centre of such a premise. He despises those with whom he exists; despises them for that one of them was involved in the death of that aforementioned brother, and the grudge has stuck. Those of whom he exists with are toons; cartoon characters literally walking, talking and existing with the humans within this world of 1947 Los Angeles - a breaking of a reality so shocking, that the film distills how we react through that of its lead when Valiant himself exclaims upon the first instance of that 'wall' being broken.'Toons seem bound to serving that of the humans to some degree, be it in the form of waiting on tables; acting as doormen; barmen or even, in the case of Disney's famous elephant lead Dumbo, an acting talent for a major film studio - one wonders what role it might be possible for Dumbo to play besides that of Dumbo. Director Zemeckis gets all the fun of the fair out of these ideas, accommodating various 'toons to professions that suit their characteristics, in that an exceptionally large gorilla is a doorman; an octopus is able to work several orders at once behind the bar and animated penguins make for waddling waiters serving customers.In the grandest of noir traditions, corruption where there really ought not be any, is afoot; Christopher Lloyd's local judicial chief, aptly named Doom, and his team of 'toon weasel assistants form the film's source of conflict. Doom's arrival, clad all in black and with a walking stick plus-limp creating a false sense of harmlessness, is via a canted angle as Valiant peers upwards at him; an apparent oneupmanship already underway as Doom incorrectly entrusts to have caught Valiant in an act. Doom and his team are scouring the city for the titular Roger Rabbit following the belief he murdered a film producer. His 'toon wife Jessica, uniquely sporting human-like characteristics away from those of an anthropomorphic nature, was involved with this producer but it is a crime Roger maintains he did not commit. In crying out to Valiant for help, in turn offering him the chance to put to bed his 'toon-hating ways and going back on a case he'd only previously had taken with his brother whose death still resonates, the fun that is Who Framed Roger Rabbit kicks off.Where a lot of noir's tone is born out of post-war disillusionment, the two very different inflections of Valiant and Roger clash head-on in a physical sense when the lead finds himself working with him, a raucous 'toon whom cannot help but exclaim loudly and proudly at whatever chance he gets, making for great humour when in danger, and yet stands in stark binary opposition to that of Valiant's more downcast stature eventually making for excellent comedy and drama. Zemeckis deals with everything wonderfully well, using such a concept to act as a backdrop to intelligent film-making and utilising such a notion to formulate wondrous comedy in what is a thoroughly enjoyable and surprisingly smart comedy; a film that rocks along without letting up for a second. From its audacious opening to its familiar finale of good vs. evil fighting one on one, only with a total overhaul of creativity and mirth via the dizzy array of ideas the screenwriters are permitted to work with given the setting, the film is at once wholly rich in detail between animation and live-action; funny for people of most ages; arrives with a real sense of threat and danger maintaining drama and generally instills a good feeling.

Cappi.. something or other? Cape Fear will jog your memory of just how talented these two were, and how well they worked together. De Niro plays a hardened and learned criminal named Max Cady who has just served a 14 year sentence in prison for raping a teen-aged girl. Nick Nolte plays the attorney who defended him at his trial, but apparently didn't use all the evidence he had that might have at least lightened Cady's sentence. It was obvious to him that Cady was in fact a dangerous creep who needed a long stay behind bars. While in prison, Cady has been studying up on the law and acting as his own lawyer. And you'd better believe he knows all about what his lawyer didn't do for him. Now, he's out and looking to pay that lawyer and his family a visit. Make that several visits... each one creepier than the last! How can an average guy like Nolte's character protect his family from the guy when the legal system seems to help criminals more than regular citizens? How far can a man be pushed when his family is in jeopardy before he steps outside the boundaries of law himself? These are the questions posed by this remake of Cape Fear, and it will pull you in and make you think long and hard about them.The film basically centers around De Niro's creepy performance as the newly-freed criminal who not only has a strong body, but now a sharp mind honed by years of obsession behind bars. Nick Nolte gives a generally understated and effective performance as the lawyer who now finds himself the subject of this animal's wrath. As a rule, lawyers are mostly portrayed as flawed at best, and sinister at worst by American cinema. Nolte's character would be on the good side of that spectrum. He has not always been faithful to his wife, and sometimes he explodes at his daughter. Ask me, this daughter deserved a trip to the old woodshed. Too bad it took a maniac like De Niro's character to open her eyes about how the world can work.The film is quite gripping and graphic in its depiction of the violence and terror that Max Cady brings to those in his path. The film isn't as tight as you might hope, and some scenes end up rambling. The scene where Cady tries to seduce the teenager in a school auditorium comes to mind in that sense.

The Birds is a film that proves this title oh so well. It was released back in 1963, yet 48 years later it is still terrifying. It's the story of Melanie Daniels as she pursues a handsome San Fransico man named Mitch to his hometown of Bodega Bay. Upon her arrival the birds of the town start to act strangely. They begin to randomly attack people very sporadically. The attacks grow increasingly vicious and what started as an attack by one bird here and there becomes massive attacks from gigantic flocks of birds. You could never predict a movie about killer birds to be so terrifying, yet The Birds will prove you wrong as you will never look at a crow the same way again.This is a movie that you really have to give a chance despite a few kinks in the beginning. Well, I honestly wouldn't call them kinks, just necessary ground that must be covered. The film starts off pretty slow, with a lot of mundane activity. The movie starts out very average and very normal and its easy to get a little bogged down. But after an hour of set-up and creeping suspense building everything pays off. When the film finally kicks in to full gear you realize the necessity of the somewhat dull first half of the film and it is completely worth it.In a lot of older horror\/thriller films I'm able to pick up what is supposed to be scary, but due to my desensitized nature I'm not actually scared by it. The Birds is a completely different story, however. This film is truly terrifying. The technical prowess of this film is astounding and it all works towards a goal of honestly scaring the living hell out of you. Hitchcock directs with such thrilling brilliance that you can't take your eyes off the screen during the harrowing bird attacks. He also employs a sort of blue screen effect to fill the screen with angry birds swirling around in a raging mass. Then of course he adds fake birds for the actors to interact with and, allegedly, real birds.But where the real thrill comes from is the sound. The spine tingling sounds of angry birds squawking and screeching adds uncanny amounts of thrilling effect to the film. The sound is edited together to achieve maximum chills, and it definitely achieved its goal. The bird attack scenes are just so powerful and so disturbing that you feel like you are in the midst of it all. The film boasts some masterful editing and ingenious direction that creates some of the most suspenseful, as well as strikingly terrifying, moments imaginable.While the first half of this film is dull yet necessary, the second half does everything possible to make up for a slow start and The Birds ends as a powerful thriller that is incredibly memorable. Alfred Hitchcock is nothing less than a filmmaking genius, and the thrills provided by The Birds during the film's second half proves that all too well. This is a film that sends chills down your spine and will thrill you to the end, especially with one of the most haunting final shots in cinema history.

Why the feud? Hackman wants to immediately launch a nuclear strike against a rogue Russian General, as per orders, whilst Washington wants to surface and re-confirm these orders with the White House.The film is better than most of its siblings, the submarine genre's claustrophobia preventing Tony Scott from his usual excesses. Script doctoring by Robert Towne (Chinatown) and Quinten Tarantino also elevate things, Towne bringing some clever, witty, tense, verbal sparring, and Tarantino bringing his usual assortment of pop cultural references (Star Trek, the Silver Surfer, racial gags etc).The film has a thin sliver of racism running through it, Hackman belonging to an era of pre-civil rights, militaristic, white, racist, nationalist law, while Washington's the smooth, well educated black man, a multiculturalist who schools white boys on the dangers of hate and aggression. Specifically, Washington's channelling black actor Sidney Poitier's role in The Bedford Incident, another cat and mouse submarine movie. The name of Crimson Tide's chief submarine, The Alabama, itself recalls 19th century Alabaman slave plantations.As a thriller the film works well, part Dr Strangelove (Hackman even listens to Barry Lyndon mood music in his cabin) and part a super condensed, super fast, clothesline of all the usual submarine thriller clichés. If the film works, it's because our leads effortlessly chew scenery, spouting machine gun dialogue and pleasantly hamming up their parts whilst Scott's slick, MTV cinematography lingers on sweaty faces, metal and sexy gear. Hans Zimmer's score is rousing.The film moves fast, preventing us from realising how contrived and implausible the plot is. It's not only that a nuclear strike against a terrorist is ridiculously excessive, but that everyone in the film is yelling, hyperbolic and jumping from one extreme to the next. Do real submariners behave this way? Of course not, but it's fun to watch.Interestingly, the film manages to lay equal blame upon the shoulders of both Washington and Hackman. They were both right and they were both wrong, the film says, Scott hoping that we ignore the larger wrongness of the US President ordering a nuclear strike in the first place.Unfortunately, this balance is ruptured by some last minute sequences which completely demonize Hackman's character. He pulls a gun on a sailor, swears and physically assaults several characters. Where the film's source material wants ambiguity, Tony Scott wants conventional action movie bad guys. Then, magically, Washington and Hackman become buddies, smiling and patting each other on the back whilst Hackman walks off into the sunset like George C Scott's General Patton, a well meaning relic who simply belongs to a different time.
