Sounding like he's giving a monologue for a movie that's a cross between Dragnet and Unsolved Mysteries Criswell tells us that what we are about to see is true based on the evidence that has been substantiated in the investigation of the facts that are presented in the movie. Based on those irrefutable facts we should reward the innocent and punish the guilty in the matter of what we are about to see on the screen. Well that's something that will get your attention if nothing else does! We're told by Criswell that there's flying saucers hovering over the earth using some kind of electric ray to rejuvenate the recently dead and bring them back to life to be used as an indestructible army of human Zombies. Their mission is to stop the governments of Earth from building super bombs and ending up destroying themselves as well as the entire Universe. The aliens have tried peacefully eight times before to get the human race to stop their drive towards self-destruction but to no avail. With the governments of earth shooting at their aircraft, and and in some cases downing them and killing their crews members. Now their taking off their gloves and going to Plan Nine and instead of trying to be peaceful and talkative with the Earth leaders their going to resort to force. What happens in the movie is that the aliens are foiled and destroyed by the heroic earthlings so that now they can develop more and more powerful weapons to destroy themselves as well as the Universe along with them. Taking away the stupid and ridicules sub-plots that Ed Wood Jr. put into the movie that consists of Vampires Zombies flying saucers looking like car hubcaps and aliens dressed up like extras from a movie about Knights of the Round Table Plan Nine from Other Space is truly thought provoking for a film released back in the 1950's. It was back then that criticizing the governments actions in regard to nuclear testing for the purpose of national security was practically unheard of. One scene in the movie that tells it all but is made to look by director Wood as if the aliens were the bad guys trying to do in the people of earth but really was just the opposite! They were really trying to save them and get them off from their road to self-destruction.Eros, Dudley Manlove, the alien crafts captain tells those earthlings that he invited on his spaceship the reasons for his getting in contact with them was to stop the earthlings from building a Solarnite Bomb! A super nuclear bomb which not only can destroy themselves but the entire Universe. The dense and brainless hero of the movie Jeff Trent, Gregory Wallcott, completely misinterpreting what Eros said then starts to brag to Eros saying that if we, the USA, develops this Solarnite Bomb We'll be even stronger then we are now! Which to the shock and surprise of Eros, who just explained to him how dangerous a bomb like that was, tells him just how stupid he and those on earth are. Eros then gets belted, by an outraged Trent, in the mouth for trying to put some sense into his empty skull. The movie ends like it started with Criswell ,again taking center stage, telling us emphatically that The story that you just saw is completely true. Criswell goes so far to even challenge those of us watching the movie saying Can you prove that it didn't happen? Then adds, to his both smug and self-righteous monologue, How do you know that after you leave the theater and pass someone in the dark that person is not from outer space? Which is well in line with a lot of the idiotic things that we've seen, and heard from Criswell, in the movie. But I have to admit that Criswell's last words are really thought provoking and do hit home.

Until then, the closest thing the Italian audience had seen to terrifying was Walt Disney's SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS. Directors like Mario Bava and Dario Argento saw SNOW WHITE and were inspired by it during their own ventures into terror. Bur Argento never came close to showing his love for SNOW WHITE more than in 1977 with the release of SUSPIRIA. When seen today, it's no wonder that SUSPIRIA remains one of the two Argento titles to have a successful theatrical run in North America (his debut BIRD WITH A CRYSTAL PLUMAGE grossed to the #1 spot). Suzie Bannion (Jessica Harper from PHANTOM OF THE PARADISE) is a young American ballerina who arrives in Germany to join a famous ballet school. The same dark stormy night she arrives, a mysterious girl (Eva Axen) is murdered (in one of the most shocking murder scenes ever shot) and many other strange events start happening at the academy. What is going on? This is the question that Suzie, her friend Sarah, (Stefania Casadini) and the audience will be left asking during the 98 minutes of SUSPIRIA (notice the mathematical mistake at the tagline) and like most of Italian horror, it lacks a logic narrative. We know there is something weird involving witchcraft in this school and we know Joan Bennet is behind it (when Joan Bennet runs your school, you know there is something wrong) but a logical explanation is never given, for the better. The film's tagline is referring to the first 15 minutes, which indeed are horrifying as hell. The image of the hanged blood-soaked Eva Axen remained in the mind Wes Craven, who would pay tribute to it in the opening of SCREAM, (1996) but he didn't come even close.   This is one visual masterpiece that uses the story as a backseat to the breathtaking cinematography by Luciano Trovoli, (MURDER BY NUMBERS)the haunting musical score by Goblin, (DAWN OF THE DEAD) and the dark nightmarish situations from Dario Argento. SUSPIRIA is indeed one of the better photographed films from the 20th century. This is one of those rare occasions that you could choose a random shot and hang it in a museum. Before shooting the movie, Trovolini and Argento carefully studied SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS in order to give SUSPIRIA a fairy tale atmosphere. Jessica Harper's large eyes and skin make her one heir apparent to Snow White herself. Either the the dance academy's red hallways, or the dark blue shadows attic, or the futuristic daylight scene with amazing architecture (early shades of Argento's TENEBRE). Trovoli's camera is always up to interesting moves, like the tracking shot of Alida Valli's feet as she walks to a crate. Argento and his wife Daria Nicolodi (who was supposed to play Suzy before Harper snatched the role) scripted SUSPIRIA based on Thomas De Quincey's drug induced essay Suspiria de Profundis as well real life events that happened to Nicolodi's grandmother. The great Udo Kier goes further with that on his important scene in the film I believe that bad luck doesn't come from broken mirrors, but from broken minds. The script of SUSPIRIA is far from bad, but it is hardly remarkable and the artificial sounding dubbing limit the actors to express themselves visually like the silent film era (Harper, with her expressive Bette Davis eyes, is the true standout). But the technical elements like music, cinematography, and direction make SUSPIRIA the dark fairy tale that SNOW WHITE A TALE OF TERROR (1997) should have been.

Bob Dylan's accompanying song seems to sum up the feckless, amiable, unfettered tone of this charming but directionless film. I guess it's a movie in that people are acting in it, and there's credits at the end, but there's nothing much to interest you if you aren't given to like it off the bat.Michael Douglas as Professor Tripp is effective and enjoyable playing against type as the sort of rumpled, middle-aged underachiever more commonly associated with Jeff Bridges. He sells his lines effectively by underplaying them, and the camera lovingly strokes every age spot on his wrinkled face. I like his writing gown and his penchant for smoking pot on the porch of his middle-class town house like it was his Sunday cup of joe. Robert Downey Jr. is also fun to watch, because he has a pulse and plays up while everyone else plays down. It might be considered overplaying, except it's needed to keep you awake. Frances McDormand is doing her usual emoting-while-sucking-on-sourballs routine, all rolling eyes and puckered lips, but she plays her romantic scenes with Douglas nicely, and their adultery is the one thing in this movie you find yourself rooting for, sort of, maybe.Tobey Maguire, I like him, but he coasts through his usual amiable alien routine here. He spends a lot of the movie just staring and saying odd things in a deadpan way, being odd often for no better reason than it moves the plot. Why did Tripp drag him up to the professor's bedroom anyway and show him Marilyn's dress? Katie Holmes and Rip Torn are conspicuously wasted, as are most of the subcast, like a here-and-gone transvestite and Douglas's soon-to-be-ex-in-laws.

Despite an intriguing premise and some good scenes , the movie was lowered down by an overdose of profanity and suffered from an unbelievably over the top ludicrous finale in which the leads are shot repeatedly without dying (Halloween 's Michael Myers would envy them) and a stream of improbable cartoonish action scenes that made Starship Troopers seem like a serious and realistic documentary !!!   This film was way too campy to like it . It may have had a good start but the final 20 minutes just killed it . Oh well it was a fun ride I guess for its most part and it was nice seeing Geena Davis achieving a great performance . Repeated viewings improved my opinion about the movie . Not much , but sensibly . Although the finale is still unbearable the whole plot is much more comprehensible and a few of my questions were answered . Let's start with a plot outline . The basic concept alone is very fascinating . Samantha Caine (Geena Davis) is a young teacher who lives in a quiet little town . She suffers from amnesia and the only thing she remembers is the last 8 years of her life . There are no tracks of any other family , husband , employment or any hint of her past for that matter . When she woke up in a hospital 8 years ago she was pregnant but of course the child 's father is unknown to this date . The detectives she hired over the years couldn 't find anything . Samantha seems to have settled down with her new adapted life . She is an active member of the PTA , she has friends, she is a good cook and bakes cookies , her 7 year old daughter Caitlin (Yvonne Zima) is a cute and obedient child and for the last couple of years Samantha is seeing a calm ordinary little guy called Hal (Tom Amandes) . Hal and she are getting along and it seems that wedding bells will ring soon enough . Until one day when Samantha shows some strange features of behaviour as if she has a split personality . Samantha has visions of a blond woman named Charlie who speaks to her in her dreams , summoning her to `join' her . You have already seen the props or probably know the story , so I don 't think that I will give away anything by saying that Charlene `Charlie' Baltimor is Samantha 's real name and she had an entirely different identity pre-amnesia . Charlie was a blond bitch , a rough tough mean killing machine . She was a trained professional assassin working for the government . After she had amnesia she was presumed dead and not even the powers that be knew she was alive . Unbeknownst to her , there are people who still want super agent Charlie (Samantha) dead . The first is an ugly bald convict called Jack and the other one is a young but ruthless criminal called Timothy (Craig Bierko) . Soon they track down Samantha and a killing expedition begins . Samantha's latest detective was Mitch Henessey (Samuel Jackson) a cheap loser who stages fake adultery incidents to make a living out of blackmails since his business has soared out . Much to his good luck however , he finds some clues about his amnesiac client which seem to point to a former fiancé Charlie once had . So Samantha and Mitch take a journey to find clues about Charlie 's past while a small army of bounty hunters is behind them . Meanwhile , Samantha 's alter ego emerges slowly but steadily . There are a couple of twists which make the movie interesting . The idea behind the script is very good and I believe the handling made by the writers and the director was competent . The progressing personality change and the flashbacks are nice and give a few hints of a psychological thriller as well as some biting `funny' scenes like the `professional chef' vegetables chopping or the scene where Charlie dispatches her torturer . I believe however that 75 % of the success of not only Samantha's depiction but the whole movie as well , is accomplished by Geena Davis . She gives a splendid performance pushing both of her character 's aspects to the edge . As Samantha , Davis performs her best Shelley Long impersonation . The sweet , ideal muffin-baking housewife who is born to run a house and raise kids . Charlie is the agile , shrewd , chain-smoking , gun toting female Rambo . Davis is more than adequate as both characters . Samuel Jackson is very amusing as the detective who gets caught in a situation he can't handle , with powerful criminals popping out of nowhere wanting to kill them and at the same time watching a clean suburban housewife being transformed to a fatal blonde agent . He spouts way too many vulgarities but nonetheless some laughs are inevitable . Something else that saves the movie from being another forgettable shootemup are the cameos . First we have Brian Cox playing excellently an old agent who wants to help Samantha dig up her true identity . He is the reliable mentor and although he is old he still seems capable of getting the hang of weapons . Now , what can I say about David Morse as Luke , Charlie 's old fiancé ? Words fail to describe him . The man is just COOL !!! He appears shortly but his contribution to the movie is huge . The rest of the cast is passable like Samantha 's daughter , Charlie 's former boss or Hal who has a short role as the boyfriend . Craig Bierko as the main villain Timothy acts very well too . He is quite realistic as a hitman\/terrorist who simply wants to complete the mission and behaves as an `ordinary' killer , with no psychotic laughs or morphasms . Despite his young looks he is quite threatening . Harlin also directed some unforgettable action scenes like the one you have all seen in the trailers  Davis firing on the icy surface of a lake while jumping off a window . There is also a memorable scene with a takeover of a Phone Station and others . I would also like to state that one viewing is not enough and you may lose some details . For example I didn't notice what was the fate of the deer at the beginning and I certainly didn't remember some hints on Mitch 's past . The movie has some problems . There are some very corny one-liners and too much swearing at times . There are also some plot holes . People tend to be extremely cruel to the scriptwriters of Halloween H20 about where did Jamie Lee Curtis find the time to raise a 17 year old son , be a member of AA , attend psychiatrists AND be the headmistress of a private boarding school but how on earth did Samantha become a TEACHER (and raise her daughter) while she didn 't remember her past , seems to have escaped you . At least Laurie Strode did go to college . Secondly it is obvious that the conspiracy described in the script was huge . They would never EVER take the chances of being exposed therefore Mitch 's family would have been murdered at a glimpse (and Samantha's beloved ones as well) . But what really gives on my nerves is the unspeakable ending . Be warned that there are SPOILERS TO FOLLOW *******  After Davis blows up the building , Mitch not only is blown up in an impossibly cartoonish manner but he hits badly on a tree and eventually he lands on earth , UNTIED and without ANY injuries !!!!! That 's not the worst though . Later Davis drives the track full of explosives through a brick wall . Maybe , just maybe we can accept the fact that the explosives couldn 't be detonated until the countdown concluded but after this nasty accident Davis and the girl also don 't have the slightest injury . Lastly a shootout battle follows and Davis survives despite the bullets she gets and the bleeding . WHAT THE HELL ???? ******END SPOILERS .  I still cannot digest the final 15 minutes (except of course for the nice showdown between Timothy and Samantha ) . If I had the power I would have reshot the whole denouement . I know that it cannot be done but at least an editor could have hacked the crappy stuff and left us with less bang-bang which would have at least make the survival of Charlie convincing. I am really not a nitpicker . I can always accept a campy scene . All of us regard Batman (1989) as a classic , although the Batwing being gunned down with just one shot by the Joker is laughable . Goldeneye (1995) with Pierce Brosnan is also a solid action film even if it contains a corny action scene in the prologue (you know what I mean) . But in here there are improbabilities which just PILE UP and almost ruin the whole thing.The Long Kiss Goodnight is a good action film with an engaging premise , some funny gags , satisfactory (for the most part) direction and some brilliant performances. The last 15 minutes spoil the whole thing though so I cannot consider it a classic . If however you want a blockbuster for a fun Saturday evening then rent it . There is some healthy entertainment in this Renny Harlin action fest .

The basic concept alone is very fascinating . Samantha Caine (Geena Davis) is a young teacher who lives in a quiet little town . She suffers from amnesia and the only thing she remembers is the last 8 years of her life . There are no tracks of any other family , husband , employment or any hint of her past for that matter . When she woke up in a hospital 8 years ago she was pregnant but of course the child 's father is unknown to this date . The detectives she hired over the years couldn 't find anything . Samantha seems to have settled down with her new adapted life . She is an active member of the PTA , she has friends, she is a good cook and bakes cookies , her 7 year old daughter Caitlin (Yvonne Zima) is a cute and obedient child and for the last couple of years Samantha is seeing a calm ordinary little guy called Hal (Tom Amandes) . Hal and she are getting along and it seems that wedding bells will ring soon enough . Until one day when Samantha shows some strange features of behaviour as if she has a split personality . Samantha has visions of a blond woman named Charlie who speaks to her in her dreams , summoning her to `join' her . You have already seen the props or probably know the story , so I don 't think that I will give away anything by saying that Charlene `Charlie' Baltimor is Samantha 's real name and she had an entirely different identity pre-amnesia . Charlie was a blond bitch , a rough tough mean killing machine . She was a trained professional assassin working for the government . After she had amnesia she was presumed dead and not even the powers that be knew she was alive . Unbeknownst to her , there are people who still want super agent Charlie (Samantha) dead . The first is an ugly bald convict called Jack and the other one is a young but ruthless criminal called Timothy (Craig Bierko) . Soon they track down Samantha and a killing expedition begins . Samantha's latest detective was Mitch Henessey (Samuel Jackson) a cheap loser who stages fake adultery incidents to make a living out of blackmails since his business has soared out . Much to his good luck however , he finds some clues about his amnesiac client which seem to point to a former fiancé Charlie once had . So Samantha and Mitch take a journey to find clues about Charlie 's past while a small army of bounty hunters is behind them . Meanwhile , Samantha 's alter ego emerges slowly but steadily . There are a couple of twists which make the movie interesting . The idea behind the script is very good and I believe the handling made by the writers and the director was competent . The progressing personality change and the flashbacks are nice and give a few hints of a psychological thriller as well as some biting `funny' scenes like the `professional chef' vegetables chopping or the scene where Charlie dispatches her torturer . I believe however that 75 % of the success of not only Samantha's depiction but the whole movie as well , is accomplished by Geena Davis . She gives a splendid performance pushing both of her character 's aspects to the edge . As Samantha , Davis performs her best Shelley Long impersonation . The sweet , ideal muffin-baking housewife who is born to run a house and raise kids . Charlie is the agile , shrewd , chain-smoking , gun toting female Rambo . Davis is more than adequate as both characters . Samuel Jackson is very amusing as the detective who gets caught in a situation he can't handle , with powerful criminals popping out of nowhere wanting to kill them and at the same time watching a clean suburban housewife being transformed to a fatal blonde agent . He spouts way too many vulgarities but nonetheless some laughs are inevitable . Something else that saves the movie from being another forgettable shootemup are the cameos . First we have Brian Cox playing excellently an old agent who wants to help Samantha dig up her true identity . He is the reliable mentor and although he is old he still seems capable of getting the hang of weapons . Now , what can I say about David Morse as Luke , Charlie 's old fiancé ? Words fail to describe him . The man is just COOL !!! He appears shortly but his contribution to the movie is huge . The rest of the cast is passable like Samantha 's daughter , Charlie 's former boss or Hal who has a short role as the boyfriend . Craig Bierko as the main villain Timothy acts very well too . He is quite realistic as a hitman\/terrorist who simply wants to complete the mission and behaves as an `ordinary' killer , with no psychotic laughs or morphasms . Despite his young looks he is quite threatening . Harlin also directed some unforgettable action scenes like the one you have all seen in the trailers  Davis firing on the icy surface of a lake while jumping off a window . There is also a memorable scene with a takeover of a Phone Station and others . I would also like to state that one viewing is not enough and you may lose some details . For example I didn't notice what was the fate of the deer at the beginning and I certainly didn't remember some hints on Mitch 's past . The movie has some problems . There are some very corny one-liners and too much swearing at times . There are also some plot holes . People tend to be extremely cruel to the scriptwriters of Halloween H20 about where did Jamie Lee Curtis find the time to raise a 17 year old son , be a member of AA , attend psychiatrists AND be the headmistress of a private boarding school but how on earth did Samantha become a TEACHER (and raise her daughter) while she didn 't remember her past , seems to have escaped you . At least Laurie Strode did go to college . Secondly it is obvious that the conspiracy described in the script was huge . They would never EVER take the chances of being exposed therefore Mitch 's family would have been murdered at a glimpse (and Samantha's beloved ones as well) . But what really gives on my nerves is the unspeakable ending . Be warned that there are SPOILERS TO FOLLOW *******  After Davis blows up the building , Mitch not only is blown up in an impossibly cartoonish manner but he hits badly on a tree and eventually he lands on earth , UNTIED and without ANY injuries !!!!! That 's not the worst though . Later Davis drives the track full of explosives through a brick wall . Maybe , just maybe we can accept the fact that the explosives couldn 't be detonated until the countdown concluded but after this nasty accident Davis and the girl also don 't have the slightest injury . Lastly a shootout battle follows and Davis survives despite the bullets she gets and the bleeding . WHAT THE HELL ???? ******END SPOILERS .  I still cannot digest the final 15 minutes (except of course for the nice showdown between Timothy and Samantha ) . If I had the power I would have reshot the whole denouement . I know that it cannot be done but at least an editor could have hacked the crappy stuff and left us with less bang-bang which would have at least make the survival of Charlie convincing. I am really not a nitpicker . I can always accept a campy scene . All of us regard Batman (1989) as a classic , although the Batwing being gunned down with just one shot by the Joker is laughable . Goldeneye (1995) with Pierce Brosnan is also a solid action film even if it contains a corny action scene in the prologue (you know what I mean) . But in here there are improbabilities which just PILE UP and almost ruin the whole thing.The Long Kiss Goodnight is a good action film with an engaging premise , some funny gags , satisfactory (for the most part) direction and some brilliant performances. The last 15 minutes spoil the whole thing though so I cannot consider it a classic . If however you want a blockbuster for a fun Saturday evening then rent it .

Throughout the entire story people and things with significance pop up in the movie that can be related with gods, people, and creatures in the book The Odyssey of Homer.  Examples of these people would be like Ulysses Everett McGill representing Odysseus in the movie.  The sirens were portrayed as the beautiful women singing on the river bank. John Goodman played a man by the name Big Dan Teague that portrayed Cyclops. He wore a white suit and a white patch over one of his eyes.  Ulysses' former wife was portrayed as Penelope, and her soon to be husband Vernon was portrayed as a suitor.  The old man who told Ulysses and his fellow convicts, Pete and Delmar there future that laid ahead of them could be related to the prophet Tiresias in the book The Odyssey of Homer.  Most of the challenges that they faced on the way to finding there treasure could be related to those challenges Odysseus face in The Odyssey of Homer.`O Brother, Where Art Thou?' is an easy movie to understand for the most part, but I had the most trouble trying to figure out how Big Dan Teague knew that Ulysses, Pete, and Delmar had so much money with them. They never talked about it in public or anything like that, and never had it out on the table where they were eating in the restaurant.  How did he know? The best part of the movie to me would have to be how the movie related to The Odyssey of Homer in so many ways.  The people portrayed similar characteristics and the same events took place in both.  The book was more easier to understand after watching this movie.  Overall, this was a very good movie, but there was one thing that I did not like, and that being that after the flood, and after Ulysses, Pete and Delmar emerge from the water and saw the cow on the roof, the movie jumps to Ulysses and his wife walking there six daughters.  How did they get back together?  What happened to Pete and Delmar, and what did they end up doing with there life?  If you think about it, that is how The Odyssey of Homer also ended, with many unanswered questions.While watching `O Brother, Where Art Thou?' I found a character that I really liked, and one that I did not like so much.  It is ironic that they would end up together as well.  I grew fond of Ulysses because of his great courage and fearlessness.  He always found a way to get himself, Pete, and Delmar out of `tight spots.'  On the other hand I did not like his wife as much because she lied to her children and told them that there dad had been hit by a train and killed.  Even, when she did see Ulysses again, she told them never to talk to strangers and that Ulysses was not there father.I found the music in this film to be very interesting, and it fit right into the time period this movie was taking place in.  The music was from the 1920's and the lyrics even fit into the challenges that Ulysses and his two friends had to get through.  At the same time, the color in the film made it truly look like this movie was filmed in to the 1920's.  Combining these two things makes a great movie and that is what happened.  I even learned a few things about life back in the 1920's from this movie!I recommend this movie to anyone, whether it be just for enjoyment, or if you are trying to find a way to understand The Odyssey of Homer a little bit more clearer.  There is some cursing in it, but nothing too bad. This movie is worth taking a couple of hours out of your day and watching.  I am sure that you will not be disappointed, I was not.

The biggest problem with this movie is the pacing. It's deadly slow. I don't mind slow movies (I love the original SOLARIS) but for a thriller, there were few thrills to be had during its entire 2 hours time. And casting Alain Delon as Tom Ripley is, even if Delon's acting is good, totally wrong. The Tom Ripley character is an average looking guy nobody cares about and who can't ever get a fair break. He fades in the background and because of this, he's capable of being a chameleon of sorts. It's hard to imagine someone like Delon in the part of a man whom no one notices or cares about. He's just too handsome for Tom Ripley. Another big problem with the film is Tom's relationship with Dickey (named Phil in this movie). In the book (and in TALENTED MR RIPLEY) there's a special love\/hate relationship between the two men. In PLEIN SOLEIL, Tom's relationship with Dickey is strictly business. This oversight basically pulls the rug from under the whole meaning of the story.But even with all these faults, PURPLE NOON is light years better than the Matt Damon\/Minguella crappy production (see my IMDB review) and it is one of the best looking films I've ever seen. It looks like it was made yesterday. The cinematography is so eye-pleasing that it's often breath-taking. And the actress who played Marge is way better than Gwyneth Paltrow. So, in the end, the film is half successful. PLEIN SOLEIL is not as moronically simpleminded as the disastrous Minguella version but it's still not true to Highsmith's Ripley books. But it is worth checking out just for the cinematography and the film's look.

He fades in the background and because of this, he's capable of being a chameleon of sorts. It's hard to imagine someone like Delon in the part of a man whom no one notices or cares about. He's just too handsome for Tom Ripley. Another big problem with the film is Tom's relationship with Dickey (named Phil in this movie). In the book (and in TALENTED MR RIPLEY) there's a special love\/hate relationship between the two men. In PLEIN SOLEIL, Tom's relationship with Dickey is strictly business. This oversight basically pulls the rug from under the whole meaning of the story.But even with all these faults, PURPLE NOON is light years better than the Matt Damon\/Minguella crappy production (see my IMDB review) and it is one of the best looking films I've ever seen. It looks like it was made yesterday. The cinematography is so eye-pleasing that it's often breath-taking. And the actress who played Marge is way better than Gwyneth Paltrow. So, in the end, the film is half successful. PLEIN SOLEIL is not as moronically simpleminded as the disastrous Minguella version but it's still not true to Highsmith's Ripley books.

That DJ is funny man Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) and we are talking 1965, Vietnam. I didn't find him very funny, but I can understand if you think that he is. Although I didn't like the character, a man who really was a DJ in the Vietnam war, I admired Robin Williams. With a lot of improvising, may be sometimes trying to hard, he does a great job. My problem is that I only liked some of the jokes and, again, there is a good chance you will not have that problem.The story is mainly about Cronauer. How his superiors try to get rid of him but his co-workers like him, especially Montesque Garlick (Forest Whitaker), how he becomes friends with local boy Tuan (Tung Thanh Tran) and how he is in love with Tuan's sister Trinh (Chintara Sukapatana).It is all a little predictable. Example Cronauer gets suspended and when they want him back he is not very willing. The sequence where he is convinced to go back, you will know which one I mean, is something that has to be in a movie like this. When you see the set-up you will predict the whole scene right.Again, I admired Robin Williams. The other performances are good as well. I loved the classic songs, I especially liked the sequence chosen during Louis Armstrong's What a Wonderful World, and of course the direction by Barry Levinson was pretty good. These things make this movie easy to watch, it doesn't get boring either, but I simply did not like it very much.

With such a pedigree you would expect so much more.  What you get is pretty funny, but imagine how much better it could have been.Richard Pryor plays an illegal casino operator in the 1930s.  He is about to be shut down by the top gangster in town. Eddie Murphy plays hi young partner, and Redd Foxx plays their mentor.  The costumes are incredible, as all of the people here are very well dressed, and the scenery is priceless, but the technical aspects of this movie cannot save the serious lack of a coherent script which is funny but too dirty sometimes, and sometimes just a little too boring.Sometimes there are patches that don't make sense, like (SPOILERS)  Della Reese getting shot in the foot, Arsenio Hall crying entirely too much, while he is shooting at Eddie Murphy, and some other very strange scenes.  But there are some very good moments.

That is the problem here, the movie has good moments but it does not have a point.  The movie tries to be a dirty comedy, a costumed 1930's drama, a gangster movie, and another version of The Sting.

I think he thought this movie was going to be such a success he really did not put much thought into it.  It is good, but he has done so much better.

I think this is tied up with the last sequel of the Dream Child. I was lucky enough to get the Nightmare on Elm Street series box DVD set for my birthday, so I got to see all the sequels. May I say that I'm just getting more and more disappointed though with these sequels, at least the past two, it just seems like Freddy lost his edge. It's almost like the writers were trying to give Freddy a soul and they're just destroying it instead of reinventing the story. This was a sequel that wasn't needed, sorry to Robert Englund, but this was very much below what Freddy Krueger represents.Freddy is back, but he's got something we don't know about, a daughter. Maggie, she's not aware that he is her father, but soon she finds out what his dark secrets are and he wants her help. She has to do her best to resist his powers, but it's hard with all the good memories she has of her loving father. Ironic, isn't it? But Freddy isn't giving up without manipulating her into his ways.Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare is also presented in 3-D, radical, huh? Note the sarcasm. This is one of the worst sequels, it's tied up with the fifth sequel of the Nightmare on Elm Street series, I'd rather watch the second Nightmare on Elm Street to be honest. This just had bad acting, stupid editing, and just over all a bad idea for a story. I didn't like the concept of it and it just ruined the whole idea of who Freddy Krueger really is, the death master of nightmares, not Father Knows Best.2\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 November 2003","score":"54 out of 79 people found the following review useful","review":" Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare, the sixth installment of the Nightmare on Elm Street series and once again another bad sequel.

I remember when Memento came out in 2000. I knew there was a buzz but I never saw it. Then in November of 2003 I saw it on cable and I was hooked. I submit that no one can see this movie once and understand it. I've seen this movie five times and still don't claim to have it figured out. After extensive research here's what I do know. The movie is about Leonard, an insurance investigator, who is the victim of a home invasion. Leonard's wife is raped and severely beaten. It's debateable whether she is killed, severely injured and dies sooner or later. It's even debateable whether she dies from these injuries (as I believe) or from an insulin overdose administered by Leonard (by mistake due to his short-term memory loss from injuries he sustained during the break-in). To help the viewer see things from Leonard's perspective (he has anterograde amnesia (short-term memory loss caused by trauma to the head from his attack) of only being able to remember things for 10-15 min. How you interpret what Teddy (a corrupt cop and the investigator from the incident) says to Leonard in the final scene is how you figure out the movie. I recently read an article where Joey P. (the actor who played Teddy) said the director\/screenwriter told him that everything he says in the final sceen is the truth. If that is true (and why wouldn't it be) I may need to view the movie five more times to sort out all of the issues. I normally get a movie after one viewing. But, the more you scratch the surface on this movie the more you get. The color part of the movie runs from last scene (literally backwards) to first sceen (middle of movie at end). The interspersed black and white sceens run first scene (of movie) to last sceen at end and then blend into the color scenes. The newest version of the DVD allows you to program the movie to see it in chronological order. This movie is a one of a kind that people will be discussing from now on!
