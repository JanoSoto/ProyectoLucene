I remembered I did not like the film. It had its moments of humor but other than that the movie was painfully boring (it would have gotten ** when I first saw it). However, I watched it on a bus today coming back from New York and realized how bad this movie is.The humor was funny the first time I saw the film but the second time around, it was so unfunny I could not believe it. Not once did I think of laughing. I actually tried to sleep but it was so uncomfortable on the bus that I could not.However, the humor may be a problem but compared to other things its more of a strength. The title character is not especially well-written. Its basically the same character Williams played in Dead Poets Society. Fortunately, John Keating was a likable character where Hunter Adams is a jerk. The filmmakers want us to like him but at times he is really unsettling. I kind of compare him to Travis Bickle and Jake Lamotta, who were also both unsettling. However, I felt something for Travis and Jake, they were characters that had layers to them. Hunter Adams has nothing to him.The film's screenplay is filled with cliches. Yes, Hunter Adams is basically John Keating in medical school. Now just put the whole Dead Poets Society in medical school and theres your damn film. Some of the dialogue is also painfully bad, I would give an example but it is so bad I can't remember.The acting here does not help matters much. Robin Williams is basically playing the character straight and that is a bad idea. Williams never makes Adams into a likable character, he just follows the scripts mistakes. The character is unsettling and immature in the film and I wished he committed suicide (A butterfly is supposed to stop him, how sappy can they get?). Monica Potter is not given much to do. Everyone else mostly fades into the background without giving much of a performance. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is effective but he is not used much and he has done better work.This film is the basic definition of the word manipulative. Never have I ever been so forced to cry in my life. Thankfully, I did not give into it. The movie is so overlong and extends for some painfully overdone courtroom scene that I wanted to end as fast it could. We never like the character to begin with, he is basically an asshole. Why would some stupid courtroom scene change that? When some judge said, We should all have some excessive happiness, I just wanted to throw up.Patch Adams was basically intended to be feel good movie with the message Laughter is the cure for pain (or some shit like that). However, this film is an excellent example of manipulative tripe. Patch Adams is too long, boring, cliched, and overbearing as hell.

The only worthy version for the big screen was The Three\/Four Musketeers double bill from the early seventies, as it followed the storyline of the book very closely and made for very entertaining viewing.And so we come to this version. This is the freest adaptation of this story I ever came across. It seems like they only kept the names and setting (18th Century France) and used a very flimsy story to tie together one sword scene after another. I did try to follow the story while trying to forget the original, but it truly is nothing else than hollow characters fighting each other. Not that the fighting scenes are bad, but most of them are hidden by the very bad lightning that haunts this movie throughout. Because of this much of the choreography is invisible and it's hard to follow who's who and what is happening. Then about the acting not much of that going on as only Catherine Deneuve (giving quite a funny rendition of the Queen), Stephen Rae (as Richilieu) and Stephen Roth (as a new character and overall nemesis Febre) can convince that there was actually a script in existence somewhere in the production. What makes it even harder to comprehend is all the different accents used some are American, some English and then of course English with a French accent. Only some of the actors don't seem to be able to make up their mind which one they are going to use, even changing in mid-sentence.I would like to give a strong point why this movie is worth watching , but it's very hard as there is nothing really original to draw your attention.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Romance"},{"date":"20 December 2003","score":"6 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" SPOILERS...The story of three cops who changed their minds. Guy Pearce begins as a coldly manipulative cop interested mainly in promotions. He winds up sanctioning the use of brute force in order to obtain what passes for justice in this movie. Kevin Spacey is sort of affiliated with the LAPD but his chief interest is in being technical adviser on a Dragnet show and getting his picture in the L.A. Times. He discovers that he has a sense of responsibility when a sympathetic young bisexual is murdered on his watch. Russell Crowe is an apparently mindless brutal thug who finds that love has made him vulnerable and that the instrumentality of anger has its limits.Overall, it's an excellent film. The theme is similar to that of Chinatown, in which Jack Nicholson, a brittle but basically decent representative of objectivity and order, discovers corruption in high places. L. A. Confidential isn't Chinatown (what is?) but it brims with the same irony and sense of dis-ease, although our identification with a single isolated human being is dispersed over a trio of flawed cops.What a well-drawn flick. Curtis Hanson handles the direction competently, blessedly without the sort of dazzling special effects a viewer has come to expect from cop movies. There is plenty of action, but no car chases, exploding heads, or slow-motion deaths. In fact, all but two of the deaths take place offscreen. That's directorial bravery for you. Bring another Medal of Valor here.The performances are about as good as they come. Danny DeVito is a tabloid reporter who speaks in headlines, liable at any moment to say something like, What he needs is a snoot of coca-cola up the old schnozzola. (This is 1953, don't forget.) Kim Basinger is beautiful as a Veronica Lake lookalike but doesn't have too much of a chance to stretch her acting chops. Guy Pearce as the independent loner is the only character who gets my respect from beginning to end. He really BELIEVES in the cause, a hard charger, unfriendly though he may be. He also looks oddly like Arnold Schwarzenegger, especially odd since he was a body builder of sorts. I knew another body builder who was Schwarzenegger's body double in Raw Deal because he was a ringer. (Do all body builder have to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger? I mean, aside from their glutes?) Speaking of body builders, Russell Crowe gets a lot of screen time in a dark brown suit speckled with what looks like bird droppings, perhaps the ugliest suit ever committed to film, with shoulders as wide as the central span of the George Washington Bridge.Two of the performances are irreproachable. John Cromwell is the corrupt police captain. He plays the role chewing gum and exuding unpretentious Irish charm (Call me Dudley.) while tempering the charm with what sounds like good-natured and sincere common sense advice. Underneath that, he's thoroughly rotten in every respect. And Kevin Spacey is perfect as the vain detective who knows his way around the show-biz part of L.A. and enjoys schmoozing with councilmen, celebrities, and the press. He's involved in the two most amusing scenes in the movie. The first involves an almost miraculous control of facial expression. He's called in for interrogation by his superiors and is asked to testify against some other officers. No, he says, I won't snitch on anyone in the department. They offer him no punishment more severe than a slap on the wrist and before he knows it, he'll be back on the show, which he loves. The show? he asks. There is a long long moment while his face sort of drifts from surprise, through disbelief, and into resignation. Then he figuratively shrugs his shoulders and says, without any deliberation, All right, I'll do it. The very model of a complete sellout. The other amusing scene is when he and Pearce accost a beautiful blond in a nightclub and sneer at her because she's a whore plastic-surgerized to look like Lana Turner. And Spacey informs Pearce to lay off, She IS Lana Turner. When they return to their car, both officers begin laughing.The photography is fine, the early 50s decor is what you'd expect from a professional job like this. There isn't much in the way of original music in the score -- hardly any in fact -- but period music is used, not overused, to good effect. (It's quality varies from Kay Starr to Cole Porter.) Extra Casting and Wardrobe even went to the trouble of making the actors playing Jerry Mulligan and Chet Baker LOOK LIKE Mulligan and Baker, although they cut Baker's recorded solo short on The Lady is a Tramp.The movie doesn't have a traditionally happy ending really. All values are gray, as they are in real life, rather than black and white. Pearce, the political animal, remains ambitious but now has distance enough from his role to see it for what it is. The same seems to be true for Crowe's character, who has found the love of a good woman. Well, the love of a woman anyway. Crowe still has a long way to go before reaching redemption. He's killed in cold blood a rapist and drug dealer and planted a gun on him and gotten away with it, but we've seen him look disgusted at some violence he's forced to witness later in the film. Vincennes is dead.This one is definitely worth seeing.Catch this, if you can.

Curtis Hanson handles the direction competently, blessedly without the sort of dazzling special effects a viewer has come to expect from cop movies. There is plenty of action, but no car chases, exploding heads, or slow-motion deaths. In fact, all but two of the deaths take place offscreen. That's directorial bravery for you. Bring another Medal of Valor here.The performances are about as good as they come. Danny DeVito is a tabloid reporter who speaks in headlines, liable at any moment to say something like, What he needs is a snoot of coca-cola up the old schnozzola. (This is 1953, don't forget.) Kim Basinger is beautiful as a Veronica Lake lookalike but doesn't have too much of a chance to stretch her acting chops. Guy Pearce as the independent loner is the only character who gets my respect from beginning to end. He really BELIEVES in the cause, a hard charger, unfriendly though he may be. He also looks oddly like Arnold Schwarzenegger, especially odd since he was a body builder of sorts. I knew another body builder who was Schwarzenegger's body double in Raw Deal because he was a ringer. (Do all body builder have to look like Arnold Schwarzenegger? I mean, aside from their glutes?) Speaking of body builders, Russell Crowe gets a lot of screen time in a dark brown suit speckled with what looks like bird droppings, perhaps the ugliest suit ever committed to film, with shoulders as wide as the central span of the George Washington Bridge.Two of the performances are irreproachable. John Cromwell is the corrupt police captain. He plays the role chewing gum and exuding unpretentious Irish charm (Call me Dudley.) while tempering the charm with what sounds like good-natured and sincere common sense advice. Underneath that, he's thoroughly rotten in every respect. And Kevin Spacey is perfect as the vain detective who knows his way around the show-biz part of L.A. and enjoys schmoozing with councilmen, celebrities, and the press. He's involved in the two most amusing scenes in the movie. The first involves an almost miraculous control of facial expression. He's called in for interrogation by his superiors and is asked to testify against some other officers. No, he says, I won't snitch on anyone in the department. They offer him no punishment more severe than a slap on the wrist and before he knows it, he'll be back on the show, which he loves. The show? he asks. There is a long long moment while his face sort of drifts from surprise, through disbelief, and into resignation. Then he figuratively shrugs his shoulders and says, without any deliberation, All right, I'll do it. The very model of a complete sellout. The other amusing scene is when he and Pearce accost a beautiful blond in a nightclub and sneer at her because she's a whore plastic-surgerized to look like Lana Turner. And Spacey informs Pearce to lay off, She IS Lana Turner. When they return to their car, both officers begin laughing.The photography is fine, the early 50s decor is what you'd expect from a professional job like this. There isn't much in the way of original music in the score -- hardly any in fact -- but period music is used, not overused, to good effect. (It's quality varies from Kay Starr to Cole Porter.) Extra Casting and Wardrobe even went to the trouble of making the actors playing Jerry Mulligan and Chet Baker LOOK LIKE Mulligan and Baker, although they cut Baker's recorded solo short on The Lady is a Tramp.The movie doesn't have a traditionally happy ending really. All values are gray, as they are in real life, rather than black and white. Pearce, the political animal, remains ambitious but now has distance enough from his role to see it for what it is. The same seems to be true for Crowe's character, who has found the love of a good woman. Well, the love of a woman anyway. Crowe still has a long way to go before reaching redemption. He's killed in cold blood a rapist and drug dealer and planted a gun on him and gotten away with it, but we've seen him look disgusted at some violence he's forced to witness later in the film.

Guy Pearce begins as a coldly manipulative cop interested mainly in promotions. He winds up sanctioning the use of brute force in order to obtain what passes for justice in this movie. Kevin Spacey is sort of affiliated with the LAPD but his chief interest is in being technical adviser on a Dragnet show and getting his picture in the L.A. Times. He discovers that he has a sense of responsibility when a sympathetic young bisexual is murdered on his watch. Russell Crowe is an apparently mindless brutal thug who finds that love has made him vulnerable and that the instrumentality of anger has its limits.Overall, it's an excellent film.

Somewhere towards the top of that list, along with Steve Martin, is Bill Murray. He's been around since the early 80s, getting his start on NBC's Saturday Night Live after Chevy Chase left for his own career in Hollywood. Murray worked live for a few years before -- like those prior to him him -- gradually making his way into the film world.I like all of the comedians in Ghostbusters, come to think of it. Dan Aykroyd is another great subtle comedian, with a great knack for writing as well as acting. It was Aykroyd, after all, who is primarily responsible for The Blues Brothers. And Harold Ramis, who later became a director, with an impressive resume of such films as Vacation, Groundhog Day, and Analyze This.Then there's also Rick Moranis, a meek nerd character who is very underrated and very funny, a sort of Woody Allen Lite. He was Dark Helmet in Spaceballs, Barney Coopersmith in My Blue Heaven, and that wacky inventor in Honey I Shrunk the Kids.Yes, one could say that Ghostbusters is built on a firm base, scripted by Aykroyd, Ramis and Moranis (who is uncredited) and directed by Ivan Reitman (Kindergarten Cop). It's a clever little story with a simple premise and lots of laughs -- a band of failing friends unite to make a hoax ghost-busting company, but soon real ghosts do show up and they're in over their heads.It starts in New York City. Peter Venkman (Murray), Raymond Stanz (Aykroyd), and Egon Spengler (Ramis) are three Columbia University scientists laid off after their grant expires with no results from the trio in return. Down to nothing, they cook up the brilliant (or crazy) idea to create a ghost-busting company.But they immediately realize that it won't be as easy as it seems to get a little extra cash, because Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver) comes to the men looking for help. Her apartment is infested with strange happenings, and her next-door neighbor, Louis Tully (Rick Moranis), is having problems of his own.They pretend to solve the situation and the men suddenly become a citywide phenomenon, attracting media attention and constant customers at their front door. They become so popular, in fact, that they are joined by Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson), another down-on-his-luck city guy looking for a good-paying job.However, Walter Peck, EPA (William Atherton) doesn't believe that the Ghostbusters are really ridding any ghosts at all, so he has them thrown in jail. But an ethreal baddie named Gozer (Slavitza Jovan) soon appears in Dana's apartment complex, and weird happenings occur, forcing Peck to free the Ghostbusters once and for all so that they can bust the ghost and send it back to where it came from.Sounds corny, huh? It's meant to be. Everything about this movie is campy and goofy, and that is exactly what Ramis, Aykroyd and Moranis wanted when they collaborated. And it is very funny.I don't know, there's something in me that loves Saturday Night Live humor. Sure, the show has its dry spots, but I love it. Many people I know don't find it all that funny, and not as consistent as something such as The Simpsons, but I love to watch it, I love the humor, and I love the actors.Part of that love, I suppose, is what makes me enjoy Ghostbusters (1984) so much. However, believe it or not, Ghostbusters is not quite as laugh-out-loud funny as you might expect. It is very funny, but it isn't always a howler. It's more of an intelligent comedy, which is odd, since it is made by a band of guys from Saturday Night Live and such backgrounds.Murray steals every scene he is in. This, along with `Groundhog Day,' is the perfect vehicle for his comedic talents, ranging from the constant wise cracks to the constant dry ironic humor that I love so much. They key to his humor is not that he comes up with it, but the way he does it. Any comedian can use the blank glares, but the way he expressionlessly glares at fellow actors is a joke in itself. When Stanz admits that his one fear has always been the Stay Puff'd man, check out Murray's face. This is classic stuff.As much a scene-stealer as Murray may be, he is nearly upstaged by Aykroyd and Ramis, who both provide a sort of counter-balance of lunatics and reason to Murray's flippant characteristics. The scene that everyone remembers it the finale involving the giant marshmallow Stay Puff'd Man, and whenever I think of Aykroyd's performance in this film, I think of that scene.Ghostbusters is a very famous comedy, and for good reason. It's light, good-hearted, funny, and actually pretty intelligent, built upon a firm cast and script, which -- considering the majority of the actors' and writers' backgrounds of Saturday Night Live -- is almost as surprising as the film itself.5\/5 stars.- John Ulmer ","genre":null},{"date":"20 December 2003","score":"69 out of 92 people found the following review useful","review":"  I have a small posse of favorite comedians.

This movie is here for one reason and I think that we can all agree on that reason.  Oliver Stone is a competent and accomplished filmmaker and most of the hate seems to be directed towards him.  Stone, who is working from a script that has since been virtually disowned by Quentin Tarantino, pretty much took over and shaped the screenplay to his own vision.I can understand why fans of Tarantino have a right to be p*ssed off, but I find it extremely difficult to believe that they truly hate the finished product, and the same goes for Tarantino.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Tarantino fan myself, and I'm sure he didn't appreciate Stone re-writing his script, but he should be proud of what was done with it.The message, if you can call it that, is that we are obsessed with violence, and Stone exposes our love for it and spits it back in our faces.

The story in itself made for a horrifying psychological thriller and some of the neat deaths (it's all about the death-by-decapitation scene, one of my favourite death scenes in a film) qualified the film into the horror genre.THE BAD--The movie does drag at times and takes too much time with some plot points that could've been cut down a lot, for instance the stuff in Jerusalem and the monks.--Though I loved his performance in To Kill a Mockingbird, Gregory Peck's performance here is quite the opposite of that.

Jackson as a Drug-dealer (very small part). The only problem I have with the cast is that a lot of the characters either are killed off or disappear before they can develop fully. The best scene is when Walken interrogates Hopper's character. It is surreal to see such great actors in the same scene. Excellent dialogue too.

The first episode entitled The Missing Ingredient is about a group of witches staying in the hotel who need some sperm in order to complete a spell. And guess who knocks on the door...Ted the bellhop! The next episode, The Wrong Man is a shorter episode about Ted getting mistaken for another man. This is certainly the strangest of the episodes. Then next comes the hilarious The Misbehavers. Ted is asked to babysit two kids of a Mexican gangster (Antonio Banderas in a parody of himself), and how everything possible can go wrong.

Two Jedi - Qui Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi - are hired to settle it with the Federation. But the negotiations fail due to their indentity being revealed much too soon by a nosey droid and all hell breaks loose on the spaceships. But our brave heros escape after battling droids and sneak aboard a ship that flies to Naboo where they reunite, thanks to the help of a clumsy Gungan called Jar Jar Binks.I could go on and on, but you all know the story plot by now. I think the movie was perfect but one small problem... they should have really improved the script, and get the charactors to put more emotion in their voices and body language. I know Queen Amidala is supposed to be a cold person who responds softly, but even that she could have put more effort into it, so the future mother of Luke and Leia Skywalker wouldn't be so dislikable. But the costumes are great, I can tell you that!The DVD, as I mentioned before, is great and RECOMMENDED for any true Star Wars fan... this is my 2nd favourite Star Wars movie (next to Return of the Jedi)6\/10 *four points lost due to wooden actingBye  ","genre":null},{"date":"20 December 2003","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  Okey, now TPM may not be the best of the Star Wars series, but still offers rare treats to both old and new fans.
