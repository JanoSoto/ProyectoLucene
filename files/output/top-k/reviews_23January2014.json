Okay, one thing the helicopter tries to get gas, but the pilot has to play like a video game joystick to get the gas put into the helicopter from a plane. WTH? That was the dumbest thing I ever seen. Oh, at the time the boat crashes the guy floats in water, and acts like he is talking to his wife, and like she is listening to him, but she isn't at all. How is that good? There is so many terrible things going on here.The captain is so gung ho on going right into the storm and dying instead of going home when he should of in the first place. This is so dumb. They got this on television. This should not even be a 6 on this site. It is that terrible. The camera is moving around so much it is hard to tell if anything is going on. I thought the first time I saw it in theater in 2000, it was okay, but still not enough to be a 6 on a rating.Just a very long movie that boring.
