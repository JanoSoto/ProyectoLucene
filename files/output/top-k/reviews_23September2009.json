Everything about it is brilliant. This should be seen by all. Though I'm not sure I'd recommend it to my parents. Kevin Smith is the kinda guy you either love or hate. In his career he has developed some of the most quotable cult classics. However some people feel that his characters are all the same. That is not entirely incorrect, to many people his characters all seem to be course and over oppinionated. However Kevin Smith provides such balance in most of his films between comedy and drama, between a crude man and a not as crude man that his films actually feel more realistic and close to home than any other comedy. I'm sure everyone can feel somewhat connected to the characters, everyone knows people like these (though maybe not as extreme). It is quite relateable really, the friendship between Holden and Banky, Holden being the intellectual and mostly staying silent or apologizing for his less socially acceptable friend. Admitedly these films are not for everyone, and personally I feel that this film has cruder dialogue than most other Kevin Smith films. Some may feel that the crudeness is unnecessary, however that is Kevin Smith. That I guess is his real talent. To be able to hide a love story behind a crude mess of comical characters that you may not wish to know in real life but sure as hell are entertaining to watch on screen.This was the first Kevin Smith movie I saw, I first saw it in 2006 on late night TV when I was only 13. I didn't know what to expect, and due to how late it was and my lack of understanding of some of the situations I didn't get as much out of it as I have now. However this was not all negative as it introduced me to Kevin Smith. Of course I wasn't aware of exactly who Kevin Smith was back then, but I became more intrigued as my older brother mentioned films such as Mallrats and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back that I started to realize my familiarity with these characters. About a year later I saw Jay and Silent Bob Strike back, again this was on late night TV. This was a much easier movie to get into and from there I got to know the askew universe far more. From there I felt inspired to rent out Clerks 2, having seen adds for it on TV, I knew it had something to do with the others. I enjoyed it thoroughly and from there I considered myself a minor Kevin Smith fan. Researching him on the internet and discovering all the links to one another each of his films display. Still I was wary as I knew it wasn't all for me having seen how much of Chasing Amy had gone over my head. But by the time I saw the original Clerks I became a true Kevin Smith fan.Admitedly though I picked up Clerks 2 in a bargain bin and figured that no Kevin Smith film could ever top it. It wasn't until earlier today (technically yesterday as it is past midnight when I'm writing this comment) after having picked up 'Clerks.' at quite a good price that I decided that to really bring more to my current Kevin Smith Collection (Clerks., Clerks 2, Mallrats) I should treat myself and buy Chasing Amy (despite it not exactly being at a bargain price at where I was shopping). I knew that I'd be pleasantly surprised. However I could not anticipate just how much I would love this movie.All the jokes completely clicked with me. The writing was some of the best I'd ever seen. I really thought the character of Holden was relateable to me (or at least how I wish I was). His dry wit. His sharp jokes. His wide vocabulary. Holden is really a clever guy with a desire to find someone he can connect with. Sure Ben Affleck has made a few bad career choices, but this is by far his finest performance. Jason Lee too delivers a career best. He plays a great contrasting character to Holden. He is a bitter, cynical man who we see is really quite unfulfilled in his life. Having nothing really except his friendship with Holden. And appearing to not even having a career without him. Banky is, a brilliant and surprising character (no spoilers). Like many people have already said, Joey Lauren Adam's steals the show. I myself always found her to be annoying in her other roles (especially her voice). And while her voice is no different, I hate to say it but she inhabits her role so convincingly that it would be a crime for me to not applaud it. In fact right now off the top of my head I cannot remember ever being as wowed as I was by any female actor. If you want proof look at the scene that takes place outside the hockey rink.This is not just a love story, it is also a story of friendship. It is a relationship triangle (however not in a conventional sense). Each actor contributes heavily to their own respective roles. The film's conclusion is so unforgettable that you must just see if for yourself. TML O'Hare.

The sniffing machine that got a little too intimate was one of many little touches that had me laughing out loud.You can get lost in this movie. And perhaps that's what Gilliam intended. Whatever it is, it's a piece of unique theatre that does what it does extremely well. You just may not enjoy it. A bit like Dali's cloth watch.

Probably, yes. If you don't think you can handle this movie, you're quite likely to be right. It's gruesome and graphic.

In addition to being disturbing and grotesque, this manages to provide a genuine, well-told story, an original idea, nicely developed characters, several of whom we can care about, and suspense that is expertly crafted. This is truly terrifying, and the last half-hour is to be experienced by anyone who considers themselves a fan of horror. Be it those based on atmosphere, or the more direct, visceral ones. With maybe one exception, there is not a single jump scare in this that does not pay off. The pacing is good. Acting is great, the performances are almost exclusively convincing. The tension of this is thick. There are immensely memorable lines of dialog in this. The special effects are mostly well-done, and tend to hold up well, even today.

His idea of dark, night-set streets and neo-realist inspired sets that encompass apartment flats, as the sorts of people that inhabit the screen are introduced to us, plunge the viewer into a world of anxiety; danger; near-poverty and a gross sense of unpredictability as we realise Nil by Mouth will not follow conventional narrative formula. Instead, it'll spend a lot of time with pent-up, aggressive males doing whatever it is they do. If there's a reason not to be blown away by Nil by Mouth, and this is linked to why I don't think Gary Oldman has directed much since, then it's because the film is a documentation; a hark-back to times and conditions of old brought into the 1990s. It's a basic re-telling of hostile people living amidst low-level living conditions more than it is a substantial study of anything.This is not an eerie look into the life and world of a drug addict alá Trainspotting and this is not a study of one man questioning his identity and role within a 'group' further still within society alá The Football Factory, although the look and structure of the film, particularly the opening, will remind you of these examples. I'm not sure what Nil by Mouth is; perhaps a faux 'grab the camera and shoot on street level' urban drama that utilises necessary acting heavy weights to carry it; perhaps a very straight forward and simplistic look at life in a specific place at a specific time as the proverbial bottle of fizzy liquid is shook and shook before opened and just exploding in a fury of anger, activity and mess.The film is about a collection of individuals living on a less than glamorous London housing estate, while it predominantly covers Ray (Winstone) and his no-nonsense, mess-about mate Mark (Foreman) with supporting turns from a number of others including Oldman's real-life sister Laila Morse, who he gets to swear a lot, (playing Janet) and Valerie (Burke) who's Ray's wife. Oldman peppers the opening twenty minutes, which turns into the opening thirty and then onto the opening forty before quickly becoming an hour; with a number of seemingly random and unconnected incidences. Characters go to a pub; some try to acquire drugs; others go to strip-joints whereas in other scenes, characters target and set up organised attacks on other men whom, in rather a sick 'in joke' on the writer's behalf, step out of a fast-food restaurant named 'Wimpy'.Ray and Mark drive the early scenes almost entirely on their own. The scenes are accompanied by the sorts of dialogue that land you in the world within a film, creating the illusion you're in the room with them, or that you've seen and heard people exchange words like this before. The things these people talk about are pithy, undemanding and feel improvised in their realism and the effortless delivery on the performer's behalf. We see, or observe, these people through the wary and watchful eyes of Valerie and a young man called Billy (Creed-Miles); we see them as they see them we are made aware of their presence and what sorts of people they are as they drink with us; dine with us; drive us and occupy our living rooms. But Nil by Mouth is one long, and I think somewhat deliberately, arduous building and building to a certain scene much later on. We are plunged into the fire of the world and these people that inhabit it, but it's a one note tune; setting up the characters and the setting and everyone's relationship to one-other and the setting; but we don't get much else afterwards.After an hour or so of Mark and Ray and friends standing around talking of things they've been up to lately; swearing a little; smoking and cursing the police whenever a siren revs up in the distance, we get a little tired. Nil by Mouth has no direction bar the scene it gives us involving Ray and Valeire nearer the end. Trainspotting and The Football Factory give us an equally street-set, low level look at a 'group' of people you would never, and I mean never, want to get involved with or interact with. But as it progressed its characters, peppering their journeys with light comic relief, towards an inevitable confrontation with their way of life (Was it worth it? in The Football Factory and Choose life in Trainspotting); we were interested and engaged with these low-lives as a seemingly random passage of events propelled them through their existences. If Nil by Mouth could be compared to a piece of this ilk at the time, it'd be 1999's Human Traffic; a film that nothing more than documents the lives of specific no-body individuals; the protagonist of which, horrifically, just needed a good sex session to figure everything out. Whilst it isn't as bad as Human Traffic, it's as disappointing.Surprinsignly and annoyingly, Nil by Mouth goes on a bit more after the 'scene' has occurred. It would've been better if it'd ended after we get the obligatory 'angry male trashes room' scene; a scene that carries no dramatic weight in cinema anymore. The film looses all interest and engagement after 'the scene'; descending into a series of nicey-nicey interactions around which one character is jailed for involvement in drugs giving off a false sense of actual closure. If the film is anything at all, then it's a few would-be neo realistic scenes that are carried by some great dialogue and some two dimensional characters being brought to life by talent that can do better anyway.

It works very well here. First of all, there is the impression of both the border towns, with their bleak and depressing qualities. It didn't seem to make much difference which side of the border the action takes place; both places seem to be just as unwelcoming and unfriendly. During the opening scene where the bright white car moves through the streets, carrying the bomb, the people are anonymous and uninvolved, ducking this way and that (quite visible because of their lightness), interested only in their own affairs. Because we have been given knowledge of the timing mechanism, we begin to figure, in our heads, how long it will be, and which of the pedestrians will be affected. There is an actual choreography at work in this scene. Bright white food wrappers and garbage blow through the town, accentuating the heat. There also seems to be a caustic edginess to each scene with nothing to brighten up the proceedings (not that there is anything light or charming about this film). The young Mexican men can be seen in their white clothing, standing on street corners. The film choice places them in our visual realm. In other scenes an opposite effect is presented. This would be a sort of chiaroscuro effect, as in painting, where things blend together and become ambiguous. The threat in this film seems to come from everywhere, and this ambiguity of scene hides the danger. There are odd shadows and angles all through the film. Who knows what is lurking in the shadows? Welles's character, Quinlan, is a study in black and white himself. He dominates in every scene he appears. He is childish, touchy, and arbitrary. His light colored clothing and size allow him to fill the screen. He wears a white hat which he pulls over his eyes. Camera angles allow us to look up into those eyes. The dark shadow of the brim of his hat covers much of his face, but those piercing, almost reptilian eyes manage to peer out. Light is focused on those eyes, and they become even more threatening. The perspiration on his face is also accentuated by the use of black and white film. We can see the beads of sweat running down his face. His jowly cheeks and brow make him look like a rhinoceros, about to charge. They betray his insecurities to the camera. He is revered by those with whom he works, and he is able to hide his fears under his hat. He is menacing and lack of color helps with this.Other figures benefit as well. One of the ongoing criticisms of this film is that Charlton Heston is playing a Mexican. It is said frequently that even though they darkened his skin, he still had little to recommend him as Hispanic. In today's film world, it would be utterly laughable. Apparently, Welles had Charlton Heston forced on him by the studio and was really uncomfortable about it. Unfortunately, being a man of grandiose possibilities, his ambitious plans were often squelched by the moneymen. Nevertheless, black and white makes Heston a bit more believable if you don't think about it too much. Janet Leigh has that chiseled beauty with high cheekbones and an angular face. There are times when she is absolutely stunning and the contrasts of this medium really seem to work for her and camera. She is also very sensual in some scenes, particularly in the motel. When she is attacked by Grandi's men, their black leather jackets and almost glowing faces make their appearance overwhelming. They literally wash her out of the motel room with a rush of humanity. I was convinced by this scene that she was going to be raped, but apparently this didn't happen. One other character, a fortuneteller, played by Marlene Dieterich, gains tremendous screen presence by the use of dark makeup, accentuating her piercing eyes. She is made to look incredibly mysterious in black and white.

This would be a sort of chiaroscuro effect, as in painting, where things blend together and become ambiguous. The threat in this film seems to come from everywhere, and this ambiguity of scene hides the danger. There are odd shadows and angles all through the film. Who knows what is lurking in the shadows? Welles's character, Quinlan, is a study in black and white himself. He dominates in every scene he appears. He is childish, touchy, and arbitrary. His light colored clothing and size allow him to fill the screen. He wears a white hat which he pulls over his eyes. Camera angles allow us to look up into those eyes. The dark shadow of the brim of his hat covers much of his face, but those piercing, almost reptilian eyes manage to peer out. Light is focused on those eyes, and they become even more threatening. The perspiration on his face is also accentuated by the use of black and white film. We can see the beads of sweat running down his face. His jowly cheeks and brow make him look like a rhinoceros, about to charge. They betray his insecurities to the camera. He is revered by those with whom he works, and he is able to hide his fears under his hat. He is menacing and lack of color helps with this.Other figures benefit as well. One of the ongoing criticisms of this film is that Charlton Heston is playing a Mexican. It is said frequently that even though they darkened his skin, he still had little to recommend him as Hispanic. In today's film world, it would be utterly laughable. Apparently, Welles had Charlton Heston forced on him by the studio and was really uncomfortable about it. Unfortunately, being a man of grandiose possibilities, his ambitious plans were often squelched by the moneymen. Nevertheless, black and white makes Heston a bit more believable if you don't think about it too much. Janet Leigh has that chiseled beauty with high cheekbones and an angular face. There are times when she is absolutely stunning and the contrasts of this medium really seem to work for her and camera. She is also very sensual in some scenes, particularly in the motel. When she is attacked by Grandi's men, their black leather jackets and almost glowing faces make their appearance overwhelming. They literally wash her out of the motel room with a rush of humanity. I was convinced by this scene that she was going to be raped, but apparently this didn't happen.

It works very well here. First of all, there is the impression of both the border towns, with their bleak and depressing qualities. It didn't seem to make much difference which side of the border the action takes place; both places seem to be just as unwelcoming and unfriendly. During the opening scene where the bright white car moves through the streets, carrying the bomb, the people are anonymous and uninvolved, ducking this way and that (quite visible because of their lightness), interested only in their own affairs. Because we have been given knowledge of the timing mechanism, we begin to figure, in our heads, how long it will be, and which of the pedestrians will be affected. There is an actual choreography at work in this scene. Bright white food wrappers and garbage blow through the town, accentuating the heat. There also seems to be a caustic edginess to each scene with nothing to brighten up the proceedings (not that there is anything light or charming about this film).

This is probably Tim Burton's most commercially successful film after the two 'Batman' movies, airing on the cable channels on a regular basis and still as fresh and funny as ever.I think the Hollywood money people are finally coming around to the fact that Burton has become a very bankable director, if they are willing to indulge him in the occasional outré production, like 'Mars Attacks!', for his loyal fans who long ago recognized a true 'auteur' (I don't like that word but...). Few directors have put their individual stamps on their films that are instantly recognizable; Hitchock, Bergman, von Trier, Herzog, Fellini, Tarnatino and some others, and now Tim Burton. In 50 years we will still be watching Burton films while many other current darlings of Hollywood will be forgotten.'Beetlejuice' might seem like a dark, ill-tempered story to those who haven't seen it, but it is one of Burton's most light-hearted creations, in spite of the fact that the lead characters are killed at the beginning of the movie and, like 'Topper Returns', appear as ghosts who are instrumental in changing earthly affairs for the still living.Michael Keaton is hilarious as the eponymous lead, supported by some great comedians at their best, notably Catherine O'Hara (what has happened to her?), Jeffrey Jones, Glenn Shadix and the late, great Sylvia Sidney as the chain-smoking, tough-nosed, abrasive-tongued spiritual guide.There is one unforgettably hilarious scene set at the dinner table and all the guests are possessed by Beetlejuice and sing 'Day-oh-dayayay-oh!' while being manipulated like marionettes around the table. The climax of this scene is classic.This film is highly recommended for all ages, even very young children will like it, though some of the facial f\/x are a bit scary, and the scene in the heavenly waiting room, though screamingly funny, may not sit well with youngsters trying to go to sleep in a dark room afterwards.

I think an old comic book I read introduced me to him. I had no idea that a live action movie featuring the main character plus other characters from the cartoons had ever been made until towards the end of 2001, when I saw a bit of it on TV and saw who was playing Popeye, Robin Williams. To this day, I haven't seen any of Popeye's animated cartoons, nor have I ever been an avid fan of the comics, but have finally seen this entire live action movie from start to finish. Beforehand, I saw its low rating here, but also knew a lot of people seemed to like it, so I decided to watch it with an open mind. Nonetheless, it was not entertaining for the most part.Popeye is a sailor with muscular forearms who rows his boat one stormy night to a seaside town called Sweethaven. After going around the town and meeting various people, with some negative reactions, he arrives at the Oyls' boarding house, where he rents a room. He quickly falls in love with the daughter of the family, Olive, but this leads to trouble, as Bluto, a big bully in the town, is to marry her. The sailor also meets a hamburger loving man named Wimpy. During Popeye's stay in this town, he accomplishes a lot with his fighting skills, which brings him a lot of attention from the townspeople, and also, with Olive Oyl, he finds an abandoned baby boy and names him Swee'Pea. However, one man who is hard to take on is Bluto, who wants revenge on Sweethaven after Olive dumps him, and it's up to Popeye to try and stop the ruffian! The part at the beginning with Popeye on his way to Sweethaven is a little tedious, but after that, as the sailor sings his way through the town as he meets some of its residents, it is pretty funny. However, it soon goes back downhill after that, I think when he makes it to the boarding house. For the rest of the film, it drags on and is rarely funny. I did laugh a bit here and there, during parts of the boxing match, and the part where Popeye meets his long-lost father, but most of the film isn't very funny at all. In addition to the lack of humour, there's also too much talking, and as a musical, some of the songs aren't bad, but a couple songs sung by Olive Oyl, played by Shelley Duvall, are ridiculously repetitive. Even if that's for comic effect, it's not funny, and it doesn't help that Duvall sounds quite bad singing in her Olive Oyl voice. Robin Williams does a decent job playing the starring role, but unfortunately, that is overshadowed by the film's flaws.Since I've usually never paid attention to the Popeye cartoons (comics and animations), I can't really make comparisons between them and this full-length live action adaptation. However, I have seen several other films starring Robin Williams, so I can make comparisons between this film and others I've seen featuring the comedian. It appears he made his silver screen debut in Popeye, and while not all the films he has starred in since then are that good, he has definitely been in much better ones than this. This film is not lacklustre because of Williams, he seems like a great choice for the role of Popeye, but because of the problems I've mentioned, it still fails to deliver. Despite how much criticism this movie has faced, a lot of people would disagree with what I've said about it. We're all entitled to our opinion, but I've given my two cents' worth.

The same is true of the themes of murder, deceit, corruption and duplicity which are pervasive throughout. Many of the familiar noir visual motifs are also present, such as the way in which cigarette smoke is lit, the rain soaked roads at night, the heavily shadowed interiors and the lines of shadow (created by louvred doors) across people's faces.Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage), an injured war veteran without money or a job, stops off at a bar in Red Rock, Wyoming and is mistaken by the proprietor Wayne Brown (J T Walsh) for a hit man that he's arranged to employ to murder his wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). Michael, a naturally reticent person, does nothing to disabuse Wayne of his misapprehension, especially as he could use a job and at first doesn't realise what he'd be expected to do. After having been told what his mission is and been given a $5,000 advance, he goes to see Suzanne and warns her about Wayne's plan. She doesn't seem overly concerned about the danger she's in and offers Michael double the fee Wayne had offered, for him to eliminate her husband.Michael decides to take the money he'd received from both parties and leave town. His plan fails however, when he accidentally drives into a man who is standing in the middle of the road and decides to take him to hospital to receive treatment for his injuries. At the hospital, things get more complicated when it emerges that the patient is Suzanne's lover and he has two bullets in his stomach. This leads to the local law enforcement officers getting involved and the revelation that Wayne is the Sheriff!! From this point on, things get even more complicated and also decidedly more dangerous especially when the real hit man, Lyle from Dallas (Dennis Hopper) arrives on the scene.Red Rock West has some great moments of suspense, (an example of this is the scene in which Michael makes his escape from Wayne's bar) and also some great performances from its very strong cast. Nicolas Cage's expressions are extremely natural and convincing as he reacts to a variety of situations with anxiety, surprise or uncertainty and J T Walsh is also particularly good as a deceptive character who's always concealing more than he's actually saying. Dennis Hopper is intensely threatening as the vicious contract killer (a role he plays with great gusto) and Lara Flynn Boyle looks suitably cold and calculating as the femme fatale. Dwight Yoakam also provides some good support and moments of humour in his cameo role as a no nonsense truck driver.Incredibly, Red Rock West was originally destined to be denied a general cinema release but has justifiably emerged from its modest beginnings to eventually be recognised as the great movie that it really is.

After having been told what his mission is and been given a $5,000 advance, he goes to see Suzanne and warns her about Wayne's plan. She doesn't seem overly concerned about the danger she's in and offers Michael double the fee Wayne had offered, for him to eliminate her husband.Michael decides to take the money he'd received from both parties and leave town. His plan fails however, when he accidentally drives into a man who is standing in the middle of the road and decides to take him to hospital to receive treatment for his injuries. At the hospital, things get more complicated when it emerges that the patient is Suzanne's lover and he has two bullets in his stomach. This leads to the local law enforcement officers getting involved and the revelation that Wayne is the Sheriff!! From this point on, things get even more complicated and also decidedly more dangerous especially when the real hit man, Lyle from Dallas (Dennis Hopper) arrives on the scene.Red Rock West has some great moments of suspense, (an example of this is the scene in which Michael makes his escape from Wayne's bar) and also some great performances from its very strong cast. Nicolas Cage's expressions are extremely natural and convincing as he reacts to a variety of situations with anxiety, surprise or uncertainty and J T Walsh is also particularly good as a deceptive character who's always concealing more than he's actually saying. Dennis Hopper is intensely threatening as the vicious contract killer (a role he plays with great gusto) and Lara Flynn Boyle looks suitably cold and calculating as the femme fatale. Dwight Yoakam also provides some good support and moments of humour in his cameo role as a no nonsense truck driver.Incredibly, Red Rock West was originally destined to be denied a general cinema release but has justifiably emerged from its modest beginnings to eventually be recognised as the great movie that it really is.

It's impossible not to empathise with the honest, unassuming hero or to be gripped by the ways in which he tries to navigate his way out of the terrible predicaments that he finds himself in, so all you can do is fasten your seat belt and enjoy the ride.The story of an ordinary guy who makes a poor decision and then finds that the repercussions propel him into an uncontrollable sequence of events from which he is unable to extricate himself is pure film noir. The same is true of the themes of murder, deceit, corruption and duplicity which are pervasive throughout.

The melding of slapstick with social commentary ran thin for me, but again it could just be that I lack le bone funny. At least I recognized parts here that likely were intended to be ribald (as opposed to some Japanese humor, where I'm often completely lost).Perhaps it is not that the humor is stupid (although the recurring dimwit incest interlude and the outhouse surprise...surely push it), but that the characters are stupid. That being said, the lead character it is of course crucial that you see him as a bozo of sorts, but behind his broad caricature of indolence, is there some intuition or even initiative stashed away? Again, an ambitious choice to have an apparent laggard as your lead character. He's seen as perpetually exhausted and at the same time amazingly lazy. An inept if not corrupt sheriff, but potentially very fair-minded. A slothful yet irresistible sex machine? That character alone was worth the watch for me, especially a couple of more serious discussions he has.But ultimately what does the film do? Take us from the joys of a meaningless existence to the tragedy of a meaningless existence. The directors sets up some of the early kills as somewhat justified, only to move through less and less necessary slaughter ending abruptly with the image of innocence being as wantonly wasted? And that image is meant to tie back visually to the films start, as if to imply this is just the way of the world. A cycle of violence.Does this excuse our pot-bellied peculiar policeman?

And do the three women intentionally seem to similar, as if they are plots along the same curve and that curve is a circle.I don't know, and regrettably I did not care as much as I should have. Perhaps the clumsiness of the film that might pass as charm for other viewers? Perhaps the predictable randiness, that even a few decades ago felt like a use of sex as cheap titillation.Is it just a parable of despair?

(Coincidentally, Hoffman appeared in both films.) KRAMER VS. KRAMER isn't just about divorce, it's also about a father trying to connect with his son and juggle a successful career at the same time. This is something every mother, father, and even child can relate to. Dustin Hoffman is Ted Kramer, said father in this wrenching film. Meryl Streep is Joanna Kramer, the other half of the title. Jane Alexander is their friend and neighbor, Margaret Phelps. And 8-year-old Justin Henry is Ted and Joanna's son, Billy. Along for the emotional ride is Howard Duff, as Ted's lawyer John Shaunessy, and JoBeth Williams as Ted's bed partner and secretary, Phyllis. Based on the 1977 novel by Avery Corman, KRAMER VS. KRAMER deals with the effects of abandonment (this time by a mother!), divorce, estrangement, and reconnection. It is a sobering look at a successful executive who's life couldn't be better until his wife leaves him due to unsatisfaction and marital unhappiness. His attempt to connect with his little son, the boy's mother returning after finding herself, and ending in a bittering custody battle. What can you say about this film? I'll tell you! It was something that I, a very stubborn young man, could understand and relate to. I, myself, was a child of a broken home. My parents were Ted and Joanna; and I was Billy!

Here is the story, based on Pierre Boule's creepy and caustic critique of human bigotry, of a group of astronauts discovering a planet where the highest primates are hairy apes, and although Rod Serling homogenized it and dumbed it down for mass-consumption, Boule's unnerving look at apes being as big a group of jackasses as humans came through.Some folks just hate science fiction. I don't criticize them, but I do recognize that there are people who dislike the trickery of satire, the hidden meanings of parody, and the lack of straightforwardness that so often gums up space operas. That John Carpenter of The Day the Earth Stood Still is a Christ-like figure (JC--get it?) trying to warn humanity to make peace with itself before the robot Gort (God's anger) is unleashed is lost on viewers who, when confronted with a message movie want Hollywood to follow the advice of a studio exec back in the 40s who said, If you want to send a message, use Western Union. There are folks who just don't like the genre because, I think, they think that movie makers are trying to mess 'em up. This probably explains why Serling made Boule's book more American, more palatable to the folks who would deliver the majority of the ticket receipts.POTA is so deeply ingrained in our culture that there are more people who recognize the often-quoted lines from Charlton Heston than actually saw the movie. Since all cultural allusions are eventually subject to mistreatment by The Simpsons, folks know Get your stinkin' paws off me, you . . .  more than the film's darkly clever heart.That it is clever, I assert, is the reason why The Planet of the Apes is, possibly, the perfect Science Fiction adventure. Watching Chimpanzees, Orangatans, and Gorillas mirror groups in our society isn't overly sophisticated, but it is fun, and that's why POTA works so well. We can be poked and prodded, but not wounded by the movie. And, like other great Sci-Fi works, the aspect of adventure trumps the intellectualism. We may giggle at the humanisms spouted by the apes (and for the Creationists in the audience, there's some not-so-subtle digs at the Genesis vs. Darwin argument), but when Heston's George Taylor is tried by a nasty and bigoted tribunal of Orangatans, his arrogant character becomes us, stripped and humiliated by powers out of our control, and he and we start doing a slow burn that will carry the film to its shock-conclusion.There are weak spots in the film--the small scale TV-ishness of many of the settings, and those damned latex appliances that couldn't allow the actors to move their lips while they talked--but Roddy McDowell, Kim Hunter, and Maurice Evans are obviously having a ball, and this is transmitted very effectively. Throw in Heston, serious and angry, a misanthrope in a land ruled by sapient apes, and the tension is palpable! You want him to escape because he is one of us, and he's surrounded by more of us, regardless of them being in monkey suits.So, satire and action are the order of the day, served up by the creator of The Twilight Zone and Franklin J. Schaffner, the director of another, sillier Heston flick, The War Lord, a few years before. The jokes are labored and the socio-criticism is a bit too obvious, but the pace of the movie, its unfolding of the story, and that Holy Crap! ending make up for the weak spots.Enjoy the best that POTA has to offer and ignore the mistakes.

I've thoroughly enjoyed it several times since on DVD - including last night. The only flaw that really gets to me is in the opening scene where the gay friends are playing at acting straight and Benji is declared the loser for misusing the term girlfriend.

But what's more is that it is a fascinating film all around. Arthur Penn's Little Big Man, an example of anti-establishment films of its period, is a ceaselessly absorbing endeavor to frame an epic in the fashion of a tall tale. It essentially succeeds. When it doesn't, when there's a bungle of mood or an overemphasized mockery, it becomes a part of the broader, richer, more plentiful scope of the film's yarn format. We're apt to go along; all engaging storytellers weave exceptionally long-winded ones from time to time, and loop back to be clear we got their favorite bits.It is the bona fide neighborliness of Penn's film that makes it, most importantly, such an insightful and substantial account of Native Americans, the West, and the American dream. There's no loud percussive pandemonium, no sermonizing, no deep-voiced narrators making certain we got the gist of the last massacre. All these adventures occurred long, long ago, and they're described by a 121-year-old man who simply wants to keep the story weaving by relinquishing it. The tall tale is the most mutable of narrative formats. Its teller can stop and reflect to emphasize a point, he can hurry ahead ten years, he can forget a whole era in recalling the folklore of a single man. He doesn't delineate the account of a time, but its suggestion. This picaresque epic gives us the suggestion of the Cheyenne civilization before white men brought true barbarism to the West.Dustin Hoffman pushes new bounds of his own versatility as the title character, who gets around reasonably enough. He reaches all the corners of Western legend. He was brought West as a settler, raised as a Cheyenne, touched base with gunfighting and snake oil peddling, staked out for the cavalry, dabbled with the hermit life, was married twice, survived Custer's Last Stand, and sat at the foot of an old man named Old Lodge Skins, who disciplined him in the clear Cheyenne notion of nature.Old Lodge Skins, played by Chief Dan George with such cool and confidence, doesn't evangelize the Cheyenne outlook. It is part of him. It's all the more a part of him since Penn has allowed the Native Americans in the film to speak real, colloquial English. Thanks to John Ford and John Wayne, and yes, the Lone Ranger, most movie Indians have had to depict themselves with an um at the end of every other word. The Natives in Penn's Revisionist Western have dialogue echoing the informal fullness of Indian tongues. When Old Lodge Skins merely indicates Cheyennes as the Human Beings, the phrase is to the letter, and significant, and not played for laughs.Regardless of Old Lodge Skins, nevertheless, Little Big Man doesn't quite come off as an Indian, or as a white man either, or as anything else he attempts. He sees, hears, retains, and endures, which is his role. The protagonists in the film are two concepts of society the Indian's and the white man's. Custer orchestrates his bloody massacres and is massacred in proper sequence, and we know that the Indians will ultimately be vanquished as a natural civilization and shoved aside onto reservations. But the film's motion is periodic but patterned, and so is its conviction about Native Americans.Penn has maintained the tall tale structure for a purpose. All the characters who are introduced at the outset of the film return in the latter half, gratified in their own ways. But Old Lodge Skins is the only character who ends up not just in one piece, but augmented. His survival is echoed by the film's form. Most films, particularly ones with violence, have their climax at the end. Penn puts his near the middle. It is Custer's butchery of a Native American village, and Little Big Man sees his Native wife killed and his baby's face pumped with lead. Penn can conduct brutality as pragmatically and diplomatically as any American director. He does here.However Custer stays dead, and Old Lodge Skins doesn't quite die like he is sure he will. So he leaves his customized setting of death and coaxes Little Big Man home with him. Custer's society will ultimately triumph, but Old Lodge Skins' will prove superior in strength, will and intimacy with the real world. I doubt it is hit-or-miss that we don't smile when Old Lodge Skins mentions the distinction between Custer and the Human Beings.

Nothing could have saved this movie. I am writing this review in a state of rage, anger, embaressment (of having been seen watching the movie), and pain. So where exactly did this movie go wrong? It had a great cast, an all-star cast if you will. The movie had tons of money to spare, as could be seen by the liberal use of the special effects budget and the enormous sums paid out to the numerous big-name actors. Steve Buscemi was in it, and he is in many good movies. So what is wrong. First of all, the acting was dreadful. I sensed that every actor was delivering the lines the same way that a hostage reads his ransom note. They seemed to be in constant pain and were probably kicking themselves for accepting such a poor script. The lines were delivered with a lack of coviction and sense of reality. Now onto to reality; this movie is not reality. The Rock was more realistic than this. Wait...wait Star Wars was more realistic than this. OK, no biggie. Action films are never supposed to coincide perfectly with realism. However this film goes so far from the laws of physics that it is unforgivable. For example, what happens when a motorcyle crashes into a fire truck? That's right it explodes. Or what happens when a large transport plain crashes in Vegas? Yep, that's right it skids for a few miles without going off of the road. Furthermore, nothing was ever explained. How was 'The Virus' able to hijack a fire engine and why didn't anybody stop Poe from getting onto the police bike? It's pathetic. Steve Buscemi was another problem. I saw the movie looking up for a short period of time when he appeared, then what happens? He has tea with a little girl and she 'reforms' him. I can't think of something more cliché than the child reformer. Oh yeah and children should never be allowed to sing in movies, or at all. The ending was so overblown and corny that it became completely unwatchable.

Eastwood falls to the need to feed his little children because his hogs are sick and bad times are on the way. He engages his old friend played by Morgan Freeman and get the bunch of them in way over their heads. If there is a more complete villain than Gene Hackman in all of film, I'm not sure who it is. He is killing machine who is in control of his empire. He lives on the fear of others. He brutalizes people and then grins. He is working on a house, hoping to sit down and enjoy the sunsets at some point. But you don't mess with him. Everyone understands that and they fall in line.
