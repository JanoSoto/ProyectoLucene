We can't even begin to imagine running off of the landing boat only to be shot and killed by the unseen enemy.

Other than that this movie doesn't really have that much to offer.  Why didn't LA Confidential win best picture?  Also, doesn't James Horner's score sound recycled from Braveheart?

Personally I thought he was about as deadly as Michael Cain with a spud gun.  Willis is hired by a powerful K.G.B boss to take out the head of the F.B.I because they killed his brother in a major raid.  The F.B.I get wind of this planned assassination, but they have no records of the Jackal, nor as anybody ever seen him, except one I.R.A prisoner who is Richard Gere.  Doing two life sentences for murder, he agrees to help them find the Jackal if he is allowed the possibility of being set free after it is all over.  The film starts off very slow and continues that way until the last thirty minutes when the action starts, if you could call it that as Gere and the F.B.I try and locate the Jackal.  I won't give away anymore, but basically this film is slow, uneventful, unimaginative and lacks any good action sequences. Willis is a professional hit man but he didn't convince me that he was an expert, or a cold blooded killer, who everybody respected and feared.  Maybe it was just bad acting.  In the film the Saint with Val Kilmer you actually believed that he was a brilliant con man who could get in and out of anywhere and his disguises were actually convincing. As for the other actors Gere played his part well as did Sidney Poitier as the F.B.I agent in charge.  My opinion is keep well away from this film.  I give it a TWO out of ten.
