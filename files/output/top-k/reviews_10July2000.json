The story takes place during the 1970's in Los Angeles.  A mother-less family of near-destitute nomads lead by the father manage to exist by skipping on rent, then finding a new apartment every month or so.  Most of the characters are tedious stereotypes.  The main character is Vivian (Natasha Lyonne); a teenage girl who is curious and insecure about her developing sexuality.  She is a decent actress, but Lyonne gets nothing interesting to work with.  We see Vivian go through all the coming of age experiences we've come to expect  Smoking dope, loss of virginity, etc.  Her brother is a typical drug dealer\/user. Rita (Marisa Tomei), a flaky emigrant from the east coast enters the picture somewhat later.Though these characters are played by generally fine actors, they are given nothing interesting to do.  Most of story revolves around Vivian, and the film tries to find humor in her sexual development.  This could have worked, but most of what happens has been used so many times before that it's no longer funny, if it ever was to begin with.  A typical example is a scene with Rita and Vivian that involves Rita's vibrator.  It concludes with both of them lip-synching into it.  What is supposed to be funny comes off as silly and pointless.  Setting the film in the 1970's might have nostalgic appeal for some, but it doesn't help the plot of the film at all.The only interesting element of the film is the father Murray (Alan Arkin).  It's a refreshing switch to see a single father struggling with parenthood.  Arkin plays Murray well, conveying strength and vulnerability in a relatively unique role.  Murray is really the only character we feel anything for.  We might have felt something for Vivian if she didn't appear in such familiar scenes.Slums is one of the few films that I think was more accurately evaluated by the general public than critics.  When it was released, Slums received moderately positive reviews, but completely bombed at the box office.  It isn't one of the worst comedies I've seen, but that's not saying much considering how awful most comedies are.  The only people who might enjoy this are those obsessed with 1970's nostalgia.

This is nothing like the first Mission Impossible or even the brilliant tv show.

I was expecting John Woo to have gone back to the TV show and brought out what made it good and gave us something special - for example I wanted to see John Woo make one IMF team play against another IMF team (a sort of cat and mouse game on a big scale).The plot of MI-2 has Dougray Scott's character (an ex-IMF guy turned bad) stealing a super-flu virus and is hoping to sell it to some chemical company and make tons of money on the stock market whilst Hunt (Cruise) must recover it with the help (or lack of it) from Newton, Luther and Richard Roxburgh.The romantic connection between Newton and Cruise was fine, the spanish dance scene was eye candy and showed what direction was.  Newton and Cruise did really well to hide the script and bring out a 'love' story. Unfortuently this is destroyed when Newton (who is a master thief) turns into a damsel in distress.

The book, which is terrific, takes  you on an emotional roller coaster ride without cessation; there are passages so gripping it becomes almost unbearable at times.  The movie, however, directed by Alan Parker and starring Robert Carlyle and Emily Watson, unfortunately doesn't come close to capturing the desperation, hopelessness and pathos of the book.  McCourt's autobiographical account of growing up in extreme poverty in Limerick, Ireland, is a gut-wrenching experience; that he even survived his childhood under such conditions as he recounts is a minor miracle in itself.  His father, Malachy McCourt Sr., (played by Carlyle in the movie), wasn't a bad man, in an evil sense; he was just no good.  He loved his family, but was too weak, prideful and irresponsible to even begin to look after them at all.  Though reasonably intelligent, apparently, he was nevertheless lazy to the point of slothfulness, couldn't keep a job even if he lucked into one, and most of the time didn't bother looking.  He never had money to keep bread on the table, but somehow always managed to have enough for tobacco and for a `pint' at one of the local pubs.  Carlyle, a fine actor (great in `The Full Monty'), never seems to get to the core of this admittedly complex character; the ability to mine the depths of what really made Malachy tick somehow eludes him.  His performance is passable, but it's all on the surface. \tEmily Watson fares little better with her Angela.  A Gifted actress (Breaking the Waves' and `Hilary and Jackie'), she handles what she is given to work with aptly enough, but there is so much more that simply goes untapped.  She, too, never really seems to get to the soul of Angela, whose whole life was nothing less than tragic.  And with such rich source material from which to draw, it's puzzling as to how this movie failed to deliver the emotional impact promised by the story.  That Parker chose to use the same voice as the novel to tell it is one reason, possibly.  The matter-of-fact, stoic narrative that worked to great advantage in the novel simply doesn't translate well to film, at least not in this case.  Here, it merely falls flat; somehow it gives an ambivalence to the proceedings that keeps the young McCourt, his family and their circumstances, at arms length throughout.  Visually, the movie is stunning, though; the cinematography successfully captures the bleakness of Limerick and the surrounding countryside. Parker, however, fails to blend it all in sufficiently enough with the actual story to make it effective.  Using the same approach for visual content as he does for the emotional, he succeeds only in presenting an image without enticement.  He asks his audience to bring more to this than they can, given what they are being offered; it simply isn't enough.   Still, it in no way diminishes the artistic merit of the photography, which is, in fact, the high mark of this whole endeavor. \tThe young McCourt is portrayed in three successive stages of his youth by Joe Breen, Ciaran Owens and Michael Legge; all able performances.  The supporting cast includes Ronnie Masterson (Grandma Sheehan Keating), Pauline McLynn (Aunt Aggie Keating), Liam Carney (Uncle Pa Keating) and Eanna MacLiam (Uncle Pat Keating).  For those who haven't read the novel, `Angela's Ashes' will provide some touching moments, though nothing particularly memorable.  This should have been a ten-hanky movie; instead, it leaves the tear ducts dry and the heart just a little empty.  This is an unfulfilling rendering of McCourt's acclaimed account of his childhood and, on a larger scale, the failure of society and of the Church to truly minister to all it's members.  The humor, which is laced throughout the novel, is lost here as well, which is nothing less than negligence on the part of the filmmakers, because they have excluded what was undoubtedly one of young McCourt's basic tools of survival.  In the end, then, this film, which should have been remarkable, was one of the biggest disappointments of the year.  And it's a pity, yes.  &#145;Tis.  I rate this one 3\/10.

His father, Malachy McCourt Sr., (played by Carlyle in the movie), wasn't a bad man, in an evil sense; he was just no good.  He loved his family, but was too weak, prideful and irresponsible to even begin to look after them at all.  Though reasonably intelligent, apparently, he was nevertheless lazy to the point of slothfulness, couldn't keep a job even if he lucked into one, and most of the time didn't bother looking.  He never had money to keep bread on the table, but somehow always managed to have enough for tobacco and for a `pint' at one of the local pubs.

A Gifted actress (Breaking the Waves' and `Hilary and Jackie'), she handles what she is given to work with aptly enough, but there is so much more that simply goes untapped.  She, too, never really seems to get to the soul of Angela, whose whole life was nothing less than tragic.  And with such rich source material from which to draw, it's puzzling as to how this movie failed to deliver the emotional impact promised by the story.  That Parker chose to use the same voice as the novel to tell it is one reason, possibly.  The matter-of-fact, stoic narrative that worked to great advantage in the novel simply doesn't translate well to film, at least not in this case.  Here, it merely falls flat; somehow it gives an ambivalence to the proceedings that keeps the young McCourt, his family and their circumstances, at arms length throughout.  Visually, the movie is stunning, though; the cinematography successfully captures the bleakness of Limerick and the surrounding countryside. Parker, however, fails to blend it all in sufficiently enough with the actual story to make it effective.  Using the same approach for visual content as he does for the emotional, he succeeds only in presenting an image without enticement.

I can't imagine anyone other than Kevin Spacey in the role of Lester Burnham, who goes through a midlife crisis and wreaks havoc with the lives of everyone around him.  The three young stars Thora Birch, Mena Suvari, and Wes Bentley delivered on target performances.  They add just the right amount emotional depth and pathos to save their characters from becoming the caricatures that they could have.  Chris Cooper is the fascist neighbor, and an underused Allison Janney is his submissive wife.  In a small comical role is Peter Gallagher, providing a foil for Annette Bening, who plays Spacey's wife.  Bening's performance was perhaps the most widely criticize, but I thought it was excellent.  She has been accused of being over the top.  Of course she was over the top.  That was the image of success her character was trying to project constantly, but when she stops projecting that image, we see a human side that is very touching in the film's final sequence.The film has a good message about what beauty is, and Spacey's closing monologue brings everything to a close wonderfully.  If the inevitable had come a half an hour earlier, it would seem less tragic, but that extra time gives the audience a chance to look closer and empathize with each character, even Chris Cooper's.Also of note, is the beautiful cinematography.

There are no limits to the imagination. Whatever you can think of - in your story it can happen. Unfortunately filmmakers do not very often make use of this unlimited freedom. Most of the movies made these days are just variations of stories that have been told in other movies before.Every now and then, however, someone has the courage to be original. All it takes is one good idea. That idea does not necessarily have to make great sense - on the contrary! A really weird idea can be the foundation for a really interesting film. Like What would happen, if all the birds suddenly started to attack people? (as in The Birds), or How would it be, if you had to live through the same day over and over again? (as in Groundhog Day).In Being John Malkovich that basic idea is Imagine, you would find a gate which leads directly into the brain of John Malkovich. Very original, very weird, very promising!Unfortunately this time the result falls short of what might have been. The opportunity sure was there. With a setup like this the outcome might have been a hillarious comedy, an exciting thriller, perhaps even a spooky horror-movie. It became neither.

This time with the stunt supremeo himself, Jackie Chan.  The film starts after the handing over of China and the story has some top rich Chinese bloke moving into America. Sorry, he's the Eastern city's US consul when he moves into America with his daughter. On his daughter's first day at school she gets kidnapped by Oriental gangsters who obviously seem to know how rich her father is as they ask for a ransom of $50million. The FBI come in to help but are told that one guy from China is already coming in to help (Chan). The Feds want him as far away from this case as possible because as they say they don't want this thing to get international. They decide to assign the worst LAPD cop (Tucker) to baby-sit him. This is what connects Tucker to Chan. Although they're both told to keep away from this case they end up becoming heavily involved as they decide to take matters into their own hands. It's here where the excitement starts to kick in.  The plot really is below average. But that soon becomes forgettable. This is one very entertaining action comedy buddy movie which is just so good that it puts the Lethal Weapon series to shame. You're given just the kind of over the top entertainment that you demand. Comedy from the fast jive talking Tucker and action from the fast stunt fighter Chan. You will be laughing out loud and you will be wowed over the stunts. Though the stunts from Chan aren't up to scratch as his earlier films, which might be due to age. The &#145;buddy' element between these two is just highly unlikely which is probably what makes it work so well. We also see the two of them gain things from each other with Tucker learning a few martial arts and Chan learning to be a little more cool and relaxed. The combination is just excellent. The weak plot really is just a silly excuse to see these two actors doing what they do best. The film also moves at quite a pace from one scene to the next to ensure that you aren't bored for a minute.  It may not be a masterpiece in many ways but with two actors on fine form, some stupendous action sets, quick-fire comedy, a great soundtrack and the chance to hear Chan utter a rude word, then this comes highly recommended.

To be in with the crew of Das Boot is as near as most of us will come to the real thing.All I can say is just watch it and be prepared for the best roller-coaster ride of your life.(Incidentally, if German isn't your mother tongue, then I would certainly recommend watching a subtitled version over a dubbed one (having seen both available English versions). The atmosphere just doesn't cut it the same with a dubbed voice.)The film is character driven, but it also has a plot that'll keep you guessing right up to the end.Grab some mates and settle down to one of the best and possibly most shocking experiences of your life.
