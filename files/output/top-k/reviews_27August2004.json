It can be any of these things to you depending on how you look at films. For most of us, though, Fight Club will be one of the boldest, most convincing movies we will ever experience.Fight Club centers around a guy whose name we don't find out (though he is referred to in the script as Jack, so we'll call him that). His life is slowly being drained of colour, so he fills it with products - furniture, electronics, exercise equipment, etc. His life takes a turn for the better (and for the worse) when he meets a mysterious man named Tyler Durden. Tyler awakens him to the fact that his life is empty and that his reliance on products has reduced his life to an empty shell. The two of them start their own 'Fight Clubs', where men can come and awaken themselves to their primal instincts. Jack is finally happy, but Tyler has an even more ambitious goal...(Spoilers)This movie uses subtle and not-so-subtle messages to get its point across, the point being that products, labels and companies have reduced us as humans to empty drones, passing through life unaware of our own incompetence. Jack could be any one of us. When he dies, what difference has he made? He should spend more time liberating himself rather than dragging himself further down, right?OR IS THIS THE POINT?Throughout the second half of the movie, Tyler changes what we have thought about his philosophy. The army of 'Space Monkeys' demonstrates his REAL point one person does not matter. The army is built up constantly being reminded that You are not special. You are not a beautiful unique snowflake. You are from the same compost heap as the rest of us. The army is slowly molded into Tyler's personal robots, to use as he sees fit. Humans can only make a difference when binded together to utilise their existence to aid others. This is demonstrated by Tyler's Project Mayhem plan (destroying the credit card buildings). This will lead to the 'liberation' of humankind - without credit, many people have nothing. Entire companies have their fortunes in stocks and shares.The lesson? Stop relying on credit as a way of life. Get back to the basics of humankind. Stop working on personal grooming and try your hand at liberating humans as a species.Of course I don't agree very much with any of this. But this is the point this is the filmmakers\/writers getting their point across without condensation or pansy-ass editing to make their message more tame. This is film-making without anyone caring who gets offended along the way. Bold, provocative movie-making. A must-see.

To do so was an interesting experience - reliving many memories of the war years which I mostly spent in London. I think the reason why there was such a long interval before I decided to watch it again was a subconscious recognition that it was produced at a time of crisis, largely for political reasons, and a feeling this was unduly evident in the screenplay. Mrs. Miniver was released a few months after Pearl Harbour, at a time when many U.S. citizens wondered why their country should be expending its efforts fighting in Europe when it was Japan which had attacked them  The film was quite clearly written, produced and directed with the objective of answering this question. Winston Churchill has made it clear that he regarded the release of this film as one of the biggest single contributions made to the allied war effort (worth, in his words, a flotilla of destroyers), and it is hard today not to regard the film as primarily a piece of patriotic propaganda. However the deft and capable direction of William Wyler and the almost uniformly great acting by the cast, particularly Greer Garson as Mrs. Miniver, go a very long way towards concealing the fact that one is viewing a film with a message and few would deny that the Oscars it won were thoroughly deserved. Mrs. Miniver certainly earns its place on any short list of film classics.\tThere are of course already many comments on this film in the database, I would have been reluctant to add any more but for the realization that people of my age who lived in England during the war are becoming increasingly few, and our comments - which must have a rather different perspective to those of younger generations - will not continue to be available for very much longer. Many of the very fine sequences in this film have already been reviewed more than adequately by others and I will not comment further on them; but two sequences which I found particularly evocative were the call on amateur sailors to help evacuate the British army  from Dieppe, and the pub scene where the locals were listening to the British traitor Lord Haw Haw broadcasting from Germany and telling his listeners how futile any further resistance would be. In stating this, I am simply confirming that for such documentary type films people who lived through the events depicted will assess the film on the basis of their personal memories rather than on their cinematographic quality. \tUltimately, both on its first viewing and when viewing it again a few days ago, I found that for me watching Mrs. Miniver was irritating because it inevitably showed an American view of life as it was in England. Numerous very small points indicated that we were seeing a glimpse of middle class English life through American eyes. Whilst as an English born viewer I found this irritating, it did not in any way detract from the primary purpose of the film in showing Americans what life in wartime Britain was really like, and why their involvement in the war in Europe was so vital.

After cleaning up in the West End the producer put out several Road companies and anxious to see how they were doing he visited each theatre in turn.

One of the most impressive things about it is the fact that it is shot in very long takes so that, by definition, the actors have been obliged to learn large chunks of dialogue as opposed to the average film where they may need to learn a couple of sentences at most. Ethan Hawke and the gorgeous Julie Delpy are totally relaxed with each other and give the impression that they're just winging it, saying whatever comes into their heads and occasionally it does sound gauche but mostly it hits exactly the right note. This is a very 'continental' film inasmuch as virtually nothing happens, there are no computer graphics, no sex, no violence, no severed limbs, no peurile jokes, just two people clearly attracted to each other and slowly falling in love as we stop just short of feeling voyeuristic.

No one wanted to tell this girl after that not one of us liked that movie even one little bit and could not understand why it would have been her mother's (or anyone's) favorite. That's me and 4 other women - all thinking it was absolute trash. Now - if you get off on soft core porn - go ahead and get a thrill. Otherwise - PASS!

What I kept responding with was I was looking, for something in my career field, in which I had an education, training, and experience.

So as stupid as it may sound, it's actually possible that someone could relate this movie to reality.I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. In fact, even today I still watch it once in a while, and it still makes me laugh. I always liked Green's MTV show, and to me of any movies he's been in this is the most like his show.Gord isn't a real bright fellow. He's friendly, innocent, definitely naive, immature and child-like. Yes, he's 28, unemployed and basically wants to play all the time as a child does. But Gord is looking at his talents as an animator, then using that to see the big picture.Of course, this is something his father could never understand. Was Gord's child like motivations merely building blocks for his drawings? I think so, at least a little. This is something his father never could understand. Besides, who could hardly blame Gord's outlook of the working world? In reality it does suck. Most people are under paid, little appreciated, and Gord knows this makes this point to his brother in the movie.Great scenes in this movie include Dave Davidson, getting inside the animals, the first date, the restaurant (this is a fancy restaurant!), , the audition, the bank scene, and many others.Another likable aspect of this movie is the soundtrack. The music that was chosen was great and matched the movie well. Of course, the supporting cast is top notch as well, but that's been said many times.People who take this movie too seriously, well, just need to loosen up. It's purely meant as a comedy, and to be funny. At that, as crazy as it is, the movie succeeds brilliantly. This movie is totally under rated. While I don't think it's a 10, it surely isn't a 3.5. At a minimum, it should at least be a 4-5 average.

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"27 August 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  The Friday the 13th movies from part 2 to 5 are pretty much the same thing. There's Jason still as a human, plenty of gore, sex, nudity, and the slasher elements we all know. Jason Lives, The New Blood, and Jason Takes Manhattan are stand alone movies in the franchise, each of them have unique elements. In Jason Lives Jason's resurrection is the main event in the movie and he isn't human anymore. The uniqueness of Jason Lives is the black humor mix with horror. Great 80's flick. Stands alone.*SPOILERS* The New Blood has all the slasher elements of the late 80's combined with the early 80's Friday the 13th style and a more complex storyline. Also there's a bigger budget. This is the only Friday the 13th movie where Jason faces a deadly match for him. Tina managed to hurt Jason without getting hurt unlike Freddy Krueger that had his butt kicked. Also, it's the first time that science-fiction and drama elements are inserted in the series. For the first time there's a lot more character development on the lead character. The gore is kind of disappointing. Until I get the Un-cut version (that supposedly has explicit death scenes, like Melissa and Ben's) these are death scenes that I like the least. The sleeping bag smashed in the tree is my favorite. It's pure Jason style. The direction is pretty good. Buecheler did a good job as the movie never looks cheap or boring. He knew what he was doing. The score is boring because it's the same used in Jason Lives and House II!Tina's theme stole the movie though. The make-up is pretty good when required. Jason's looks are fantastic in this movie, and Kane Hodder's first appearance as Jason is great. Unlike what most people say, Hodder gives a different feeling to Jason, it's like he makes the character. No one moves and violently kills like Kane. As many people say, this is Jason Voorhees V.S. Carrie and it's a brilliant idea. Sci-Fi V.S. Horror (slasher specifically) is one of the best mixes I've watched.What I like the most about the movie is Tina's evolution. She's beautiful fragile girl with many insecurities mainly derived for her father's death and her fear to control the telekinesis powers she has (Lar Park Lincoln does a surprisingly good job here). With the movies' events she becomes stronger, specially after she watches her mother being killed by Jason. Before facing Tina, Jason kills many people, included Eddie, Ben, Maddy, Russell, Dr. Crews, and the super hot and sensual Melissa. Susan Jennifer Sullivan deserves a special mention, she's incredibly hot. Tina gets the necessary forces to confront Jason using her telekinetic powers. The first encounter between Tina and Jason is interesting because Jason notices he's been attacked by an unknown force but obviously handled by Tina. Jason never experienced that kind of things ever.After a series of encounters where Tina easily beats Jason, the house where Tina resided blew to thousands of pieces after a spectacular explosion (yes, pretty good f\/x). After it, Tina and her boyfriend Nick think Jason's dead for good when he suddenly appears and knocks out Nick. When Tina is about to be killed by Jason concentrates her powers to the water in Crytal Lake just to awake her father from the bottom of the lake. Tina's father rises and takes Jason down with him. I must say that's a shocking and unexpected ending! Great material for the series. There's a deep storyline here that is not all about Jason. This time the story centers on the lead character that will face Jason at the end, something very brave to do as Jason since part 4 is the main star of the movie. The audience actually cares for Tina and expect a shocking ending. We got everything we can as for in a slasher movie.Friday the 13th part VII  The New Blood is one of the best slasher movies from the 80's because it has all the winning elements, a big budget, a killer storyline, a great villain, and the Friday the 13th name to support it. You can't get much better talking about slasher movies. Also, this is one of the best in the series. I'd rank it only behind part 6, and 3. Jason never looked so cool I have to say. Jason looks mean and scary, just like in the old times (Richard Brooker in part 3 in concrete).8.5\/10 in the Friday the 13th scale. Believe me, one of the best slasher movies ever.

There is no movie that I can think of, at least in my lifetime, that became the cultural event that it did. There were many concerns within the film community that the film was going to be a disaster. James Cameron had spent a long time finishing the film and it was the most costly film ever made. Many people thought it was bring an end to his career. All these concerns and predictions were shattered when 'Titanic' came out; it became the highest grossing movie ever and it won more Academy awards than any other movie. It skyrocketed the careers of both Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio. I went to the theaters to see it with family and friends. It was an incredible experience and several people around me were crying. There were very few movies I had ever seen before that had mesmerized me as much as this movie did.I watched this movie in its entirety for the first time in years. The reaction is much different now and the film seems much less impressive. First of all, the graphics in 'Titanic' have not aged well. When the ship is sinking, the CGIs look really fake and dated. Also, the model ship they used doesn't look very good either. It looks cheap and like it was made out of plastic! This does not surprise me because most films do not age well; a new generation of film lovers will not find certain films as impressive as the last generation. Putting that aside, the story of 'Titanic' is not that bad. I think most people know what the story is about so I do not need to explain it. The acting is slightly above average, but the screenplay is so clichéd and corny, I can understand the acting did not need to be that impressive. The last forty minutes of the film consists of the two main characters shouting, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack! Rose, Rose, Rose, Rose! They must love each other so much that they can't think of anything else to say.I don't think 'Titanic' is destined to become a classic. Even though it made so much money and won so many awards, I think most people now see the movie as an embarrassment. Now that I am older and wiser, 'Titanic' just seems like a mediocre film.

First of all, even though the effects are 20+ years old, they all look like high-school Haunted House-level quality. Glowing eyes on supposedly-drowned zombies? The fog itself looked like it was painted on a cel and dragged slowly past the camera. Secondly, there were so many things that didn't make any sense I don't have space to list them all here. But they include 1. Why did they attack only the ship the first night? 2. Why did they target the people they did? If they were after six people, why were they after the father and the DJ at the same time after killing five already. And why didn't they kill Father Malone while the other people were there- why did they come back later? 3. Are we supposed to believe that Elizabeth and Nick become this loving couple after he picks her up hitchhiking and then nails her?Overall I was alternating between being disappointed and laughing at how bad it was- and not in a good way. I recommend skipping this one if you have a thing for quality.

It began in 1769 when James Bruce went to Ethiopia and did a remarkable job finding the source of the Blue Nile, and doing yeoman work on the anthropology of the Ethiopian people. Then there was the work of Mungo Park and the River Niger (until his death in 1806) and there were naval expeditions up the Congo (in 1819), and various internal expeditions. By far the greatest African explorer would be David Livingston, a missionary who captured the hearts of Victorian Britain. Most of Livingston's work involved Lake Nyasa, but he tried to also solve the greatest African (possibly global) geographic question the source of the Nile River. In the 1850s two British officers from India, Richard Francis Burton and John Hanning Speke, mounted two expeditions into the interior of Africa from the island of Zanzibar. Burton was already a famous man - the first Christian to travel to Mecca and Medina. He was also a remarkable linguist. But Burton was a moody person, who could be insulting. Speke was avid to go on both journeys, but he lacked Burton's driving curiosity about the people of the continent of Africa. Speke also was extraordinarily ambitious, and wanted to find the source of the Nile. So did Burton, but he felt there was more to life than just settling a map problem. This film deals with what turned these two friends into enemies, and how a remarkable series of explorations,where Burton and Speke traveled together,and where Speke led his own exploration with James Grant, settled the mystery - but still left matters into greater confusion. On the second Burton - Speke journey, they both saw a large lake. Burton, with typical sense, named it Tanganyika, after the African languages he studied. But Burton became ill and was unable to continue circumnavigating this lake. Speke, meanwhile, had heard of another body of water to the north (Burton believed it was part of Tanganyika). Speke went on alone and saw this huge inland sea. He was convinced that he found the real source of the Nile but his proof was insufficient to Burton. Speke took advantage of Burton's illness to get back to England first, publish his findings only, and get official support from Sir Roderick Murchison and the Royal Society for his own expedition. He and Grant returned to Africa, just as Burton came home - to find himself being jeered at as having been lying on a cot while Speke was busy finding the source of the Nile. Speke came back with more details about his great discovery. He named this magnificent lake (the largest in the world) Lake Victoria. But his ego caused him to keep Grant from accompanying him on the final portion of this journey (wherein he circled the lake, and found the point it led to the Nile - which he called the Murchison Falls after the head of the Royal Society). So when he returned to England with his facts, Grant couldn't corroborate them. Burton and his friends began showing that some of Speke's observations and facts were odd to say the least (he had the Nile running up a mountain for ten miles). Soon a debate was arranged between Burton and Speke - a debate that Speke dreaded. Burton happened to be a very gifted writer and speaker and Speke was not. The debate was to occur at Bath in September 1864. It never occurred. As this film shows, Speke was killed in a hunting accident the day of the debate - whether it was a real accident or suicide has never been settled. Speke's friends blamed Burton, who was called a murderer by some of them. Burton never made a public comment again about the incident.It would not be until the late 1870s when Livingston's successor in Central Africa, Henry Morton Stanley, proved that Lake Victoria was the source of the Nile, and that Burton's Lake Tangayika was the source of the Congo. The film faithfully tells the tragic tale of how a great explorer was destroyed by his ambition, and how a close friendship was destroyed by a rivalry spurred on by a busy-body - in this case a man who was jealous of both Burton and Speke, Laurence Oliphant. Oliphant did not care who got injured. He is, in many ways, the real villain in this tragedy.

They cheered at the opening titles; they cheered at each of the 4 main character's intro scene; the 'scandalous' waltz; Melanie & Ashley's (cliched)reunion; Gable's return after a lengthy hiatus; Scarlett's smitten 'morning after' reaction to Rhett's drunken seduction (an especially loud cheer as Leigh awakens, then stretches and purrs with guilty satisfaction; it's hysterical!!), Rhett's exit line; and on and on...and on. The audience's reaction was contagious and their (my) attitude toward the film was treated with equal camp and respect. Ya just don't get that much fun at the movies with regular movie goers at regular theaters (unfortunately). 25 years later when the movie was restored and rereleased at the theaters (98 or 99), it played at some colleges and the reaction was...the same. Now that's a testament to the durable and indestructible power that this film will always have. (Note this experience was in upstate New York, not down south)There's no allusions to the fact that this is a self-centered southern (and very outdated...sometime insulting) fantasy soap opera. Scarlett is mostly a despicable character that has strength fueled by her selfish ambitions. So is Rhett! (but at least with half a heart). The fact that we still care about the characters is the real power of this film as our emotions are jerked between rooting for them and despising their actions at the same time. What this film reveals the most is...the viewer!!! If the viewer defends Scarlett's actions, is repulsed by her antics, or tries to maintain some clarity of the type of person Scarlett really is...that, in itself, can be as revealing about just what type of person the viewer is as about the characters themselves.This movie has color! It has scope! It has a big story to tell in its (short) 4 hour running time. The direction is tight, it moves quick. There's no time for an actor's ego of hey, let the camera linger and linger...and linger on ME to show the world what a great talent I (think I) have. Especially nowadays when so many performances are obsessed with (hollow) Oscar ambitions. This is a film where the story comes and is served first...the way a film's story should be.All the actors (it seems) were born to play these roles. They come off with conviction (if not in reality). But, then again, this isn't a reality movie. It just wants to tell its story and move the story along in the same spirit as the story is told in the book. You don't have to agree with its philosophies or its perceptions to deprive yourself of its entertainment.

Like how the film was needed at the time it came out because the 60's ended being the me me me decade, where if someone didn't agree they'd be the enemy. (I always thought the 60's sucked anyway) so Love Story showed people how love was done again, especially when love stories were out in Hollywood at the time. So while that may true, it stands to see how the film was huge in 1970, coming at the right time, but evidently as time went on the film because less important and its impact lessened. But in 1970 I'm sure this was major stuff.The director also states how the original beginning had Ryan O'Neil being told the girl was dying, and how that was changed because the audience didn't know the girl well enough to feel for her, with that news coming so early. So it was placed later in the picture. Thing is, who cares, when the audience gets to know Ali McGraw's character we see she is a wise-cracking unappealing wiseass, almost completely unlikable. Ali does a fine enough job, but the character is just someone you would avoid if you were a guy.Ryan does a fair job, nothing too special, he's ok, but just ok. He probably got the part more on his looks than his talent. He looks good in the role. Ray Milland is pretty cool as his dad too, but underused. The mom is there for a minute than disappears. No one cares anyway.One thing you can't say about this film is that it wastes time kicking off. They meet in the film's first scene and are in love just mere minutes later (screentime minutes). The verbal jousting becomes kind of tiresome really fast, and Ryan's character even says that to some extent in one scene, but it doesn't change anything. She is still a wiseass, for the entire film.And that damn music theme - it's all over the place. The only saving grace with it is that the vocal version is not to be heard here.

And she did overstep her bounds on the telephone with Ryan's pop.Being a hockey fan, I liked seeing the 1970 hockey scenes, and also all the cool old cars driving around. Love Story wasn't great but it was good. It was certainly better than The Way We Were but not as interesting because Streisand is fun to laugh at. I admit I was sad at the end, but I couldn't decide if it was because the girl died or I was disappointed about another legendary film not living up to the hype I've heard. Maybe a bit of both.

Stranded with nobody around, three of them seek help, and one stays at the car. But little do they know, a cannibalistic family lives in the woods, lead by the chainsaw wielding Leatherface. The teens are eventually all lead or taken to a dilapidated farmhouse to suffer torture from the psychotic family.Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Next Generation is a misunderstood movie. All of the people who criticize this movie are missing the point. This movie isn't meant to be taken seriously. It's all fun & games, and that's what I love about it. It is so bizarre and over-the-top that it makes it great. Besides the horror elements, there is also a lot of comedy in it if you really look at it. It's retro, campy, bizarre, disturbing, and funny. This would've been pure excellence had it been released in the '70s slasher era, but since it wasn't, people misunderstand it and take it far too seriously. It really is a fun slasher movie.The acting here isn't the best, but believe me, I've seen much much worse. If you want an example, go rent Bloody Murder and then tell me the acting in this film is bad. Renee Zellweger is great as always, and Matthew McConaughey portrays one of the most over-the-top villains I've ever seen and does it well. The plot is pretty much similar to the original film, but it was intended by Kim Henkel to be a semi-remake, rather than a sequel. Too bad Columbia\/Tristar made those cuts to the film, it made it a bit choppy in some scenes, but I guess it wasn't anything too serious. Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Next Generation (aka The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre) isn't that bad of a movie. If you enjoy good old campy horror movies, this one's good, just don't take it so seriously. Enjoy it for what it is. 9\/10. ","genre":null},{"date":"27 August 2004","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" In this campy sequel from Kim Henkel, writer of the original Chainsaw, a group of Texas teens get into a car wreck in the backwoods on prom night. Stranded with nobody around, three of them seek help, and one stays at the car. But little do they know, a cannibalistic family lives in the woods, lead by the chainsaw wielding Leatherface. The teens are eventually all lead or taken to a dilapidated farmhouse to suffer torture from the psychotic family.Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Next Generation is a misunderstood movie. All of the people who criticize this movie are missing the point. This movie isn't meant to be taken seriously. It's all fun & games, and that's what I love about it. It is so bizarre and over-the-top that it makes it great. Besides the horror elements, there is also a lot of comedy in it if you really look at it. It's retro, campy, bizarre, disturbing, and funny. This would've been pure excellence had it been released in the '70s slasher era, but since it wasn't, people misunderstand it and take it far too seriously. It really is a fun slasher movie.The acting here isn't the best, but believe me, I've seen much much worse. If you want an example, go rent Bloody Murder and then tell me the acting in this film is bad. Renee Zellweger is great as always, and Matthew McConaughey portrays one of the most over-the-top villains I've ever seen and does it well. The plot is pretty much similar to the original film, but it was intended by Kim Henkel to be a semi-remake, rather than a sequel. Too bad Columbia\/Tristar made those cuts to the film, it made it a bit choppy in some scenes, but I guess it wasn't anything too serious.

Love it or loath it; there is no middle-ground. Zoolander offers a much-needed dose of self-deprecation and absurdity that Hollywood so often lacks. Even comedy nowadays exits only in a self contained world that takes itself too serious. If you're not into Monty Python (or ever could be), you're likely to hate this film. However if you can stand a movie mocking its subject matter (fashion-world) as much as it does it self, you're gonna love it. All this besides; this is the most quotable movie since the Big Lebowski. If that doesn't flick your switch, we're not from the same planet.
