I do not know how close to Dostoyevsky's real life this setting was, but I do know that he was jailed as a political activist in his youth, flung in with the struggles & downtrodden lives of anyone from petty criminals to hardened murderers, in extremely oppressive jails that were often a source for the characters in his novels.This movie does an admirable job of portraying the addictive aspect of gambling, tempting & drawing the characters as well as the viewer, into the world of casinos frequently by the rich, the curious & the desperate. But just as intriguing is the secondary plot of this movie, which looks in the complexities of relationships of some of the characters involved in the gambling & how easily it escalates beyond the imagination of those partaking in such thrills. Amidst all this, we gain a glimpse into the underlying passions, the romance, the ambiguous motives, even of Dostoyevsky & this young lady presented as of much more ethical substance than one who'd governed Dostoyevsky's heart from his youth.I thought the acting is also very good, both from Michael Gambon as the author & Jodhi May as Anna, his pen.

From what I saw, virtually all of the characters are low kinds of scum, always willing to betray one another and murder for kicks. The protagonist, played by Ray Liota, lacks the depth or redeeming characteristics that Cagney and Al Pacino's gangsters had. Liota's Henry Hill has very little that would make him seem like somebody to care about, because he's always willing to betray people and lie to save his own skin. When he gets his comeuppance, the viewer knows he richly deserves it, and will find no reason to take his side. His colleagues in crime, played by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, are equally irredeemable. The only decent qualities about De Niro and Liota is that they are not quick to condone random murder, as Pesci is always apt to do. The level of violence in this movie is gratuitous and disgusting. It does little to glamorize the life of crooks, and instead makes it seem like a low, loathsome venture.This movie is full of violence and little in the way of decent themes, as virtually all the characters are too slimy to convey anything relatable to the viewer on a basic level, except that we sometimes betray others to save ourselves. The acting is decent, though not something to write home about. The plot is winding and tortuous, so pay very close attention if you want to understand the action. The plot actually seems secondary, more like a framework for a menagerie of blood-and-guts and gangster dialogue. I do enjoy movies that feature prominent ultra-violence, like Robocop and Sin City, but those movies had deep characters and themes about morality that this movie does not explore. Watch it if you wish, but don't expect this to be the classic everyone seems to think it is.PS Listen for the phrase you're busting my balls. Virtually all the main characters say it. You could play a drinking game with this movie for all the times the characters say that phrase. This likely inspired a scene in the TV series South Park, where Cartman says this phrase to people who refuse his offer to buy aborted fetuses. Good times.

The teens are to spend the night there and find answers to the big mystery of Michael Myers. But Michael intends to crash the party LIVE.This film i enjoyed and i cant understand why so many people hate it, i found it to be a good way to spend a couple of hours with a classic icon that is Michael Myers.The opening of this film is quite interesting, and opens with Michael trying to kill Laurie something he's been attempting to do for quite sometime. The opening to the film i thought was great but just a little too short to give me the satisfaction of ending that particular era of Halloween. Jamie Lee Curtis gives a good performance as this battered, beaten down woman and i think she can be satisfied with the performance as can the viewer.The film then turns to a different level with the film turning into one of those teen slasher films, now while usually this would be a terrible route for a horror film with Halloween in the title, it uses story as reasoning for Michael killing people. These teens have come into his home and so that is the reasoning for killing the teens.The acting is mediocre at best, the best performances have to go to Jamie Lee Curtis and Brad Loree who portrays Michael. Loree really gives a performance to Michael that we really haven't seen since the original, he also looks menacing which always helps, he should definitely be considered for future Michael outings! Busta Rhymes definitely puts in the worst performance of the entire cast, he portrays a guy that in his words just wanna give America a good show' well Busta you didn't so don't bother doing it anymore.The set design is creepy and the darkness throughout really makes you cringe not knowing if Michael is in the shadows waiting and i think that is such a clever usage of the lighting.Now this film does something interesting as far as cinematography is concerned. The story has the cast wearing head cams that films everything they see and a lot of the films footage is this sort of stuff with the head cam. I liked that idea and thought it worked quite well throughout the film and made it much more interesting, as though you were there with the actual characters in the film.Of course deaths are always important in a film like this and Michael has his fair share in this outing. To name a few, Decapitation, Stabbing, and a clever use of a tripod. The deaths are really what we've seen before so don't expect anything original here.The direction is all over the place with some bits like the opening done well while other seem like like he has let the cast run wild.So what's bad about the picture then? well i think the main problem has to be that Michael just keeps coming back and i think that is a real problem when they kill him off in one film and then decide hes not for the next film. Also this film seems to ignore Halloween films 3,4,5,6 which seems pointless but hey this is Hollywood.Overall i enjoyed this film, it had some good scares in places and the opening really intrigued me and sit up and pay attention. While the acting is sour and Busta Rhymes is just the most annoying guy in the whole film, this picture works and i think if you're looking for a little piece of horror to get your teeth into then look no further than this, its no masterpiece but its no piece of crap either.****** out of ********** ","genre":null},{"date":"13 June 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Halloween Resurrection is the eighth film is the Halloween franchise, it's one of those that's been going on a long time such as 'Nightmare On Elm Street' & 'Friday The 13th' but like the latter these films are just about drying up.Resurrection finds a group of teens entering the birth home of Michael Myers for a special web-cast that will be broadcast live.

When they capture Ann and offer her to the giant ape, Denham and his crew set out to rescue her...and capture Kong to bring to New York for monetary gain. King Kong is a story that everybody knows, and this movie's reputation strongly precedes it.Merian C.

They changed the characters and made the main creature a giant ape that would be brought back to New York and put on Broadway. In the early 1930s, this was a very ambitious project. Not many movies were made about giant monsters terrorizing a big city before 1933, and those type of movies didn't even become popular until the late 50s.

That's what I love, the film shows you situations that people go through and the lessons from making mistakes in life. Some people find themselves chasing fro the perfect person their entire life, not realising that the person fro them is right in front of them.This is a film not afraid to be controversial and study an issue that is very relevant in today's society. Chasing Amy is as close as you will get to romance in any of his movies. It hits the sentimental and complex notes that make it a modern masterpiece. It's fun, cute and sexy study of sexual choices and how you can never really find the perfect women. I think Chasing Amy is a groundbreaking and very important movie because it deals with topics such as homophobia. A turning point for Kevin Smith who manages to give you tips as Silent Bob on women and how he is always Chasing Amy. Kevin Smith as usual proves his movies are about characters and fast, witty dialogue. There is always a joke flying around in this wonderful sentimental comedy which leaves room for the beauty of repeat viewings. But unlike most romantic comedies (which I loathe with a passion usually) this is very different, it's not afraid to talk about sexual encounters and be frank about subjects that some people may find offensive, it tells you everything. The characters created feel real because the edge of not everything turns out the way you want it. That is something that most romantic movies are afraid to do, it makes the audience dream shatter. But that is the important point it makes everything more real. You can relate and personalise as usual with certain situations. At the same time the film is very off the wall and hilariously sexually charged with the beautiful Joey Lauren Adams playing Alyssa Jones. She acts with talent and steals the show, how she did not get nominated or even win best actress is beyond me. The Acadmeny seems to never respects the independent movie masterpieces though.What always surprises me about Kevin Smith movies is that Ben Affleck proves he can act! Ben Affleck puts on a very believable and cool role that is creatively acted. Kevin Smith might seem at first glance the kind of director who exploits crude humour. He is actually the complete opposite, they are deep, meaningful films that deal with relevant issues. You feel uplifted and yet left with a moral when watching a Kevin Smith movie because he hits the goal of entertainment. This is a movie made not for money, but for the viewer and something Kevin Smith needed to show to people who could understand situations he probably went through. Kevin Smith creates a funny movie that underneath is a very serious study of sexual nature. Kevin Smith handles risqué subjects gently and with precision. Kevin Smith is not there to show off, but to rather show his love of film.Overall a stunning, emotionally complex movie for example the scene in the car which shows a genius is at work. The dialogue and the acting hold the scene together, one that could seem very lame if done not correctly. And one more example would be the highly amusing ice hockey scene in which the pair argue while you see the image of the fight between the players breaking out and the heartbeat accompanying the scene.

That's what I love, the film shows you situations that people go through and the lessons from making mistakes in life. Some people find themselves chasing fro the perfect person their entire life, not realising that the person fro them is right in front of them.This is a film not afraid to be controversial and study an issue that is very relevant in today's society. Chasing Amy is as close as you will get to romance in any of his movies. It hits the sentimental and complex notes that make it a modern masterpiece. It's fun, cute and sexy study of sexual choices and how you can never really find the perfect women. I think Chasing Amy is a groundbreaking and very important movie because it deals with topics such as homophobia. A turning point for Kevin Smith who manages to give you tips as Silent Bob on women and how he is always Chasing Amy. Kevin Smith as usual proves his movies are about characters and fast, witty dialogue. There is always a joke flying around in this wonderful sentimental comedy which leaves room for the beauty of repeat viewings. But unlike most romantic comedies (which I loathe with a passion usually) this is very different, it's not afraid to talk about sexual encounters and be frank about subjects that some people may find offensive, it tells you everything. The characters created feel real because the edge of not everything turns out the way you want it. That is something that most romantic movies are afraid to do, it makes the audience dream shatter. But that is the important point it makes everything more real. You can relate and personalise as usual with certain situations. At the same time the film is very off the wall and hilariously sexually charged with the beautiful Joey Lauren Adams playing Alyssa Jones. She acts with talent and steals the show, how she did not get nominated or even win best actress is beyond me. The Acadmeny seems to never respects the independent movie masterpieces though.What always surprises me about Kevin Smith movies is that Ben Affleck proves he can act! Ben Affleck puts on a very believable and cool role that is creatively acted. Kevin Smith might seem at first glance the kind of director who exploits crude humour. He is actually the complete opposite, they are deep, meaningful films that deal with relevant issues. You feel uplifted and yet left with a moral when watching a Kevin Smith movie because he hits the goal of entertainment. This is a movie made not for money, but for the viewer and something Kevin Smith needed to show to people who could understand situations he probably went through. Kevin Smith creates a funny movie that underneath is a very serious study of sexual nature. Kevin Smith handles risqué subjects gently and with precision. Kevin Smith is not there to show off, but to rather show his love of film.Overall a stunning, emotionally complex movie for example the scene in the car which shows a genius is at work. The dialogue and the acting hold the scene together, one that could seem very lame if done not correctly.

Don Taylor's sequel, of course, has nothing on Richard Donner's original; and even though the film often gets too convoluted and is more than a little bit silly, The Omen II follows on from the original nicely and is an overall worthy sequel. For the sequel, the action has expectedly moved to America; and the film delivers more of the uncompromising gore that helped to round off the original as an all round horror masterpiece. Logically, the film picks up the story of Damien seven years after his father, Robert Thawn, tried to kill him under mysterious circumstances. The film starts off with the revelation that Damien Thawn is the antichrist, and from there we follow him as he joins military school, comes under the guidance of one of Satan's disciples and violently disposes of anyone who stands a chance of discovering his real identity! Jonathan Scott-Taylor is the actor given the honour of portraying the son of the devil this time around, and it has to be said that he does a really good job with it; even though the actor has hardly been seen since. William Holden is no Gregory Peck, but he does well in the older lead actor role; and he receives good backup from Lee Grant in the role of his wife. The cast is rounded off by cult stars Nicholas Pryor and Lance Henriksen. The plot pacing can be a little hard to follow, and not all the plot threads (the ones involving Thawn Industries in particular) are able to come through properly. However, director Don Taylor combats this by adding in an over the top and gory murder sequence every time the plot looks like it's going downhill. Here we have people burning to death, freezing to death, having their eyes plucked out and - of course - being cut in half in an elevator! The film just about carries off a mysterious religious tone throughout, and I was pleased that the film didn't get bogged down with theories surrounding Damien. The film ends with a nice little twist, before once again leaving the series open for a sequel - which, of course, it got three years later. The Omen II isn't a classic or must see; but it's a nice sequel.

A movie is yet to make the same impression on me. Yes, movies exist that cause frightening images every time you close your eyes, but they're mainly either based on gruesome scenes of blood and torture or involve ghosts and other somewhat fictional characters. Well, the director of Raise the Red Lantern required neither, the work, in my opinion, of a great artist and scholar of humankind and the human mind. From what we mainly know, only ghosts haunt the human world but what if we were to imagine that death is not necessary, and that instead our own selves can haunt the present even alive. What if through human suffering, rivalry, jealousy and the imprisonment of the mind we can destroy our souls and spirits. And what if even worse, it is not other ghosts or evil spirits that cause this, but our fellow human beings. I believe this is the reason why Raise the Red Lantern finds a small place deep inside its' viewers it speaks of the horrifying effects of humankind that each one of us can be affected by &#150; of death during life. Songlian, only nineteen years of age, used to attend a University in China in the 1920's, all until her fate took a fatal turn leaving her in the mansion of a wealthy man, never to know the outside world again. This mansion does bring its luxuries foot massages, a private room, your own faithful servant and somewhat of a husband - all until your servant becomes jealous of you, you rival with the Master's three other mistresses, and possibly countless others to come, and best of all, most of these luxuries are only provided so that you could better entertain and care for the Master, including bearing children for him. Once the women's' dreams are lost, what remains? - a need for passion and attention is something that each of the women rival for, and which some would be willing to do anything for, whether or not it be humane. Jealousy is strong and deception all the more so; the characters' lives are all intertwined and every action can cause a chain reaction, leading to the degradation of the human spirit and mind. What amazed me most about the director's work is the use of color to depict emotion and the techniques used to create tension, fear, struggle and a distinct message and point of view without ever having to show us the crime being committed. Every season throughout the story and every character, personality and emotion is linked to color. The various use of color tinting demonstrating sunrise and sunset, light emitted by the red lantern in its different shading and position, the symbolism behind the red lantern and the women's condition within the mansion, and the draping in black curtains of Songlian's lanterns when she has committed a crime against tradition are both visually stunning and extremely effective in creating the mood of the time. Each woman's room fits hand in hand with their personality the opera singers (Meishan's) elaborate and bright coloring as opposed to the First Mistress' dark, old wood furniture and darker clothing. And lastly, what I have seen few directors do, Zhang Yimou shows us less to make us feel more scenes of torture and crimes, in many instances we are not shown them or the faces, instead we only view them from the perspective of one of the characters. The use of sound and long camera shots allows us to embody the characters and experience the story all the more, and because each of the four actresses dove deeply into the character of the women, this experience is truly amazing.

Take, for instance, Julie Christie's hair in Dr. Zhivago, or Kate Beckinsale's...well, entire appearance in Van Helsing (although, was that even an issue in that steaming pile of bad FX?).One of the best aspects of Cabaret, then, is that it truly does feel like you're watching a movie from 1931. Well, sort of. If it were made in 1931, it would almost certainly be in Black & White, have primitive sound quality (sound pictures still being relatively new at that time), and maybe be a little less frank about its homosexual content (although being that 1931 was a year pre-code, who knows...). Perhaps a better way of putting it is Cabaret looks like you're watching actual events from 1931, not 1931-by-way-of-1972. The costumes, makeup (the overly arched brows and pancake makeup of the KitKat girls is just as creepy as it is sexy, if not more so), sets, and even attitudes are practically a living postcard of Weimar Germany (as far as this 23 year old American can tell). There are no glaring anachronisms here. It's astonishing.Another is the character of Sally. Fledgling writers are always encouraged to make their protagonists as sympathetic as possible, otherwise what will care about their journey? Sally is flighty, shallow, self-centered, and proves that she can be bought. Why do we love her so? Why do our hearts break when her father stands her up after she spent the first half an hour lying about how much he cares for her? More important than sympathy (or empathy) in a character, IMO, is dimension. With good, there is bad. With pattern, there is contradiction. Sally, above all the aforementioned characteristics, is career driven. And no one's gone to the top without a little white lie or two (or three, or four...). Of course, dimension or no dimension, the wrong actress (or even poor acting by a great actress) could make this character fall flat. It's because of that, that one cannot speak of this role without mentioning the sparkling Liza. Those who dislike the movie often site Liza's over the top acting as a chief flaw. I don't see that here. Perhaps if she were the Sally from the stage production brought over to film, this would be the case, as sometimes stage actors forget how intimate a medium film is (the severely under-rated RENT does suffer from this occasionally, for example). Her singing, while jaw-dropping to say the least, is just one part of her role. Watch this girl ACT. Look at the giddy expression on her face when Max volunteers to corrupt her and Brian. Watch her desperately (and eye rolling-ly) try to impress the upper crust at a dinner party. Watch her try and play down the immense physical pain she must be in after a back-alley abortion. Yes, she has an amazing voice, but this is performance that would scream Oscar! even if there were no singing at all.But, Cabaret IS a musical. Another sad fact is that when showtunes become standards, they lose almost all of the potency they have IN CONTEXT. Sure the title track IS a fun song and all - Come to the Cabaret, old chum! Life is a Cabaret! - on its own. But watch it where it belongs - it's quite depressing.

Well, sort of. If it were made in 1931, it would almost certainly be in Black & White, have primitive sound quality (sound pictures still being relatively new at that time), and maybe be a little less frank about its homosexual content (although being that 1931 was a year pre-code, who knows...).

Why do our hearts break when her father stands her up after she spent the first half an hour lying about how much he cares for her? More important than sympathy (or empathy) in a character, IMO, is dimension. With good, there is bad. With pattern, there is contradiction. Sally, above all the aforementioned characteristics, is career driven. And no one's gone to the top without a little white lie or two (or three, or four...). Of course, dimension or no dimension, the wrong actress (or even poor acting by a great actress) could make this character fall flat. It's because of that, that one cannot speak of this role without mentioning the sparkling Liza. Those who dislike the movie often site Liza's over the top acting as a chief flaw. I don't see that here. Perhaps if she were the Sally from the stage production brought over to film, this would be the case, as sometimes stage actors forget how intimate a medium film is (the severely under-rated RENT does suffer from this occasionally, for example). Her singing, while jaw-dropping to say the least, is just one part of her role. Watch this girl ACT. Look at the giddy expression on her face when Max volunteers to corrupt her and Brian.

It is based on the writer's own experience, and the main characters actually seem to be playing themselves. It is a film about the making of a film, so is a film within a film. I was bothered at first by Sally's rather stiff, and rather awkward movements as she learned the tango. Compared with her partner's fluidity and passion, her style of dancing seemed to me to match her personality (naturally), which I experienced as typically milk and toast English (limp). Though she is obviously fascinated by the tango, her passion does not translate to her dancing. At the very end, though, she seems to be beginning to get some true fluidity of movement and a teeny bit of sensuality in her dancing, so at the end of the movie, I found myself holding out hope that she one day, with practice and discovery of passion within herself, would be able to simulate something in the realm of that displayed by Carlo, her partner. It is a very good film, I think. She seems always to be thinking, while Carlo seems always to be moving, beautifully. He is a true artist of movement, and his joy of dancing comes through fabulously. He is poetry in motion. I enjoyed the extra material, too, though in one feature it was jumbled (production notes, I think it was) and in another (still photos, I believe) one couldn't use the pause, forward or reverse buttons and it was frustrating to have to play everything over from the beginning to be able to read things one hadn't time to read the first time around. And then not absolutely everything was able to be read the third time around, either, due to the pace. Anyway. The film is lovely, even though I was constantly irritated by the cerebral as opposed to emotional aspect of Sally's character. She moved like a broomstick, actually.

AND MRS. SMITH. Hitchcock explained to Francois Truffault in HITCHCOCK\/TRUFFAULT that he always wanted to work with Carole Lombard, and she prevailed on him to do this film with her. But that does not really explain the choice of material.Lombard, of course, is best recalled for her wonderful daffiness in screwball comedies like NOTHING SACRED, TRUE CONFESSIONS, and MY MAN GODFREY. Her co-star, Robert Montgomery, had been in many delightful comedies (PETTICOAT FEVER, PICADILLY JIM) too. But both performers had been in dramatic films. In this period Montgomery (fresh from his great performance as Danny in NIGHT MUST FALL) had made RAGE IN HEAVEN with Ingrid Bergman and George Sanders, and Lombard did VIGIL IN THE NIGHT with Brian Ahearn. They were both highly capable of dramatic performances.So why couldn't they have sought a more typical Hitchcock screenplay? My suspicion is that Hitchcock chose to make a screwball comedy as an experiment. He did that frequently when he felt like stretching his abilities, and sometimes the results were not too good. When it was a technical experiment like ROPE or DIAL M FOR MURDER he still had the strength of the film script to fall back on if his nine minute shots or his use of three dimensional film did not quite work wonders with the audience. But when he tried humor, he had less success.Hitch's sense of humor is not bad - but it works best when he uses it sparingly. In THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH (1956), Hitch sets up a delayed joke involving Hillary Brooke and another actor coming to visit their friends Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day in London. Stewart and Day leave their flat because they are going to try to rescue their son (in the hands of the kidnappers). They apologize and tell Brooke and her husband they'll be back presently with their son. Brooke and her husband look confused as they leave. The remainder of the film, and the melodrama in the embassy is played out. Final scene shows Brooke and her husband have fallen asleep waiting for them. Day, Stewart and their son come in, wake up Brooke and her husband, and proceed to act as though nothing has happened for three or four hours.That is an example of when the Hitchcock humor works. But then comes his full scale black comedy THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY, and the viewer has mixed feelings. Individual moments work, like the manipulation of the dull sheriff Royal Dano. But one finds most of the humor about moving a dead body fairly unimaginative...surprisingly so from Hitch.MR. AND MRS. SMITH is not a black comedy, but it's type of bedroom farce situation would have been better handled by Ernst Lubitsch or Leo McCarey or Preston Sturgis. The joke is that the surface-warring Smiths are really in love, but discover that their marriage was illegal. Montgomery had said he'd marry Lombard again if he had to (prior to the discovery of the illegal marriage), but instead of rushing Lombard off to any nearby church or justice of the peace he hesitates. And Lombard wonders what kind of man she has been illegally married to. So she turns to his partner Gene Raymond, who is interested in her.There are some interesting moments in the film (Hitchcock has to be of interest always). The scene where Montgomery pretends to be talking to the pretty woman sitting next to him (incurring the ire of her date) is good, culminating in Jack Carson trying to stop a bleeding nose on Montgomery by using a cold knife as a cauterizing instrument. There is also a funny moment when Lombard and Raymond, on a trip to an amusement park, get stuck on a ferris wheel on top of it during a heavy thunder storm. But these moments are far and few. As a romantic comedy it is mediocre, despite it's stars and (unfortunately) because of it's director.
