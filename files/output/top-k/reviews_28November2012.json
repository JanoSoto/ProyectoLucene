But upon closer inspection it becomes obvious that all of the applause was much adieu about nothing. So it is with this film. Having just seen it, I must say that I was not impressed. Michael Douglas (as Professor Grady Tripp) gave an adequate performance. Nothing more and nothing less. Yet for some strange reason he was nominated for both a BAFTA Film Award and a Golden Globe. Good for him. But quite frankly, I don't understand why. Likewise, Frances McDormand won the BSFC Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Dean Sara Gaskell. Again, she performed adequately. But once again, I failed to see anything in her performance that was so outstanding or noteworthy. Then there is the matter of all the awards the film received which includes the BAFTA Film Award for Best Screenplay and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Motion Picture-Drama. Because of this, one might think that this was an extremely good movie which certainly had great acting and a dynamite plot as well. Well, I guess I must have been watching a different movie because to me this film was a meandering collection of characters and events which never seemed to coalesce around anything meaningful or tangible. For example, one of the college students named Hannah Green (Katie Holmes) apparently had a crush on Professor Tripp. Okay, things like that happen. But it was nothing more than a side-event that never really went anywhere and didn't add anything significant to the film or even matter in the grand scheme of things. That being the case, I thought Katie Holmes' talent was wasted in this movie. Another rather useless scenario involved a character named, Vernon Hardapple (Richard Knox) and his pregnant girlfriend, Oola (Jane Adams). Supposedly, Professor Tripp was riding around in a car that had been stolen from Vernon and he was completely unaware of it. Again, I fail to see the significance or humor in this as it adds nothing substantial to this film. Same thing with the names, Hardapple, Crabtree (Robert Downey Jr.) and Tripp (for the pot-smoking professor). Come on. Making fun of a person's last name is the kind of juvenile humor one might find in a grade school playground--but it doesn't belong in a big time motion picture. In short, this movie had some big actors in it and it received a lot of awards. That's all well and good. But I have the feeling that maybe the stars in this cast somehow influenced the critics because the film itself didn't seem that spectacular to me and I'm sure there were plenty of other films made that year which were more deserving and much better in comparison. If not, then it must have been a bad year for the motion picture industry. In any case, I'm satisfied to let the viewers make their own evaluation and I will end with one last thought Beware of all the hype.

There's the usual series of gruesome deaths lifted from The Omen and many another supernatural yarn accompanied by the now standard choral music. There's nothing much in the way of originality about any of this, but it does at least hold the attention. The most interesting thing are the bravura speeches from the villain John Milton (AKA The Devil) delivered with great gusto by Al Pacino, but some of the gravitas is undermined by his son's rather bathetic name 'Kevin'. 'Beelzebub and Kevin' does not quite have a demonic ring to it.The formulaic script is written more for melodramatic impact than sense, with people wandering onto busy roads for no apparent reason only to be mowed down by cars and such like. One strange and inexplicable scene has a blood drenched Kevin after just seeing his wife die by slitting her own throat meet his mother. Rather than her saying why are you covered in blood, Kevin? or My God! what happened to my daughter-in-law? instead she launches into a longwinded exposition (but one telegraphed at least an hour earlier in the film) that Milton is his father. All this is gory and faintly ludicrous but is carried out with Hollywood slickness and would perhaps deserve a better score were it not for the unforgivable finale where this house of cards collapses.Kevin is tempted to join his satanic father by having sex with his own sister. Instead of this Kevin chooses to shoot himself at which point any sense the script had disappears. Kevin's sister for some unexplained reason dies. The devil's (and the emperor's new) clothes fall off, he starts to burn while shouting No! No! The only way this comically bad scene could have been improved would have been to have Pacino say, HE'S NOT THE ANTICHRIST! HE'S A VERY NAUGHTY BOY!All this makes little sense dramatically or theologically. How can you defeat the devil by committing suicide? Isn't that expressly forbidden in the scriptures? Still you could argue that the point is that Kevin makes an act of self-sacrifice and had it ended there it perhaps would not have been so bad. BUT THEN HE WAKES UP! Seriously, he is then back at the very start of the film before any of the bad stuff happened. In other words the whole thing was an extended dream sequence. This is the sort of thing that first year English students are told to avoid.To cap it all Kevin then refuses to defend his client, something than is strangely presented as a moral stance when it is actually morally and legally dubious. Isn't it a lawyer's duty to defend his client even if he knows his client is guilty?A pointless re-appearance of Al Pacino right at the end just adds to the incoherence.
