I find this to be most unfortunate because I really dislike all of these shows and I think they can easily discourage people from watching other Japanese animation shows and movies when they are considered and reputed to be the best by many Westerners.I'm not going to get into detail about why I dislike Pokemon and Dragonball Z, but Akira is a movie which I think demonstrates a great weakness in Japanese anime. For those who have read Otomo's manga, I cannot give the movie a just review because I have not read it. However, I imagine that like myself, the majority of people who have seen this movie have not read it either.From what I've seen, Akira attempts to get too abstract and too in-depth. The story is far too vague and unclear for my tastes. Most people respond to my criticism of the movie by telling me that I just need to watch it several times or that I am too used to conventional, western styles of storytelling. The irony is that I am originally from Japan and grew up watching Japanese animation, even though I now spend most of the time in the U.S. I'm just as used to Japanese literature and cinema as I am with Western, and I know a bad Japanimation when I see one. I have also viewed this film many times, trying to get a clue about the endingThe reason I believe that I am being reasonable in saying that the story is too vague or too abstract is because when I ask people who enjoyed the movie to tell me what the movie meant, instead of telling me any sort of theme they found in the movie, they usually struggle at trying to tell me just exactly what went on in the movie - particularly the ending. A good, abstract movie like this should be fairly clear in what the story was about - the only part it should leave the viewer guessing about is what the story meant, and the story should provide enough so that the someone guessing at the theme will be able to argue their interpretation justifiably.There are several other series and movies like Akira, but I think we Japanese have a big weakness at trying to be too complicated and metaphysical, or perhaps I have just developed a bias from having spent the majority of my adult years in the United States. Perhaps someone will prove me wrong.However, I think Akira is a movie that does not exemplify Japanese animation very accurately. It's very unique and doesn't follow many of the traditional techniques of Japanese storytelling. The animation also looks more like Western comics to me, especially the way the color was used. Most Japanimations also do not try to get so complicated. My favorites are usually ones with simple plots but complicated characters, and I think that's where Japanimation truly shines in its characters and through character development.Overall, I think Akira is just strange and confusing. I think the people who might enjoy it most are very creative people, who like to guess at and fill in details  with their imagination. Too much is left out for people like me - not that I don't enjoy abstract movies that leave the viewer thinking.

As a movie in itself, it's a brilliant piece of work, packed with style and -very- powerful scares. We follow teen pop idol Mima, who tries to make the switch from singing to TV acting. Everything seems normal enough at first, with just the somewhat funky directing hinting at things to come. But it wouldn't be a thriller if good ol' normality didn't come crashing to pieces to make way for some terrifying madness and violence. Things start to go pear-shaped when the studio staff working around Mima are threatened, and later horribly killed, apparently by an obsessed Mima-fan who doesn't like the new direction her career is taking. And as if that wasn't bad enough, Mima herself is starting to go bonkers with all the pressure. She begins to have visions of a disturbing alter ego, more or less her old self from her singing days. And this other Mima doesn't want to play second fiddle to the new acting image Mima has taken on; she claims to be the real one, with the flesh-and-blood Mima being the fake. Mima's delirium grows gradually more entangled, until she sinks into a mental state where it's impossible for her, and for the audience to tell what is, and what is not really happening. And there are still those murders going on...Granted, the movie within a movie gimmick has been done before so often that it doesn't even strike me anymore as original. Reality-twisting is also something I've seen before. All the same, Perfect Blue managed to impress me enormously, and scare my socks off like no other film. There's something about not knowing for sure (as a viewer) what is and isn't for real that always keeps one intrigued. Particularly during the more violent moments (and the film does get seriously nasty), one is constantly praying that it's -not- for real. Go on, snap out of it, Mima. This is too scary to be real, you're just having another vision...right? Right? The leitmotiv of a second self also intrigues me, and I found it delightful trying to pick out which Mima was really the real one. Just how strong is false Mima's presence in reality? Is she a complete phantom of the imagination, or does she have a litteral, physical presence of some kind? And most of all; out of these two versions of herself, which one does Mima really want to be? If you can't tell for sure what does and doesn't really happen, you also might not take everything the characters declare for granted. The ending does provide a somewhat logical explanation that ties up all of the insanity again, but that doesn't mean the fun of figuring this out for yourself is completely spoiled; you can very well not take the ending entirely for granted either (while it makes sense, there are some bits about the explanation it provides that don't completely gel with me). Lots of re-watchings and picking apart of hints is in store for me there. Love it when that happens ^^.A few tiny niggles; the animation quality in the first half of the film is not quite breathtaking, and seemed decidedly below-par for movie quality animation. Luckily, it picks up later on, becoming pleasingly smooth. And by the time you reach the terror of the later part of the film, you're already too frightened to really be picky about animation quality. Some of the violent and\/or explicit scenes are very nasty indeed (ewww, straight people, sick man), but they serve the purpose of enhancing the fright factor very well, rather than just being needless grotesqueries to please the gore-junkies in the style of that hideous Akira. The film is a complete success as a frightening, surreal and involving thriller (though I do still like Jinn-Roh much better).But another reason to rejoice is that Perfect Blue is a step in the right direction for the general public's image of what anime really is. Sure, the enlightened few among us for whom Evangelion is standard fare, and who can give detailed insights into the latest CLAMP titles already know that anime is not a genre. It's a medium in itself, and the Japanese animation market can, and does treat every imaginable genre and subject, often with skill that leaves feeble Hollywoodian efforts miles behind itself (in the case of Perfect Blue, it speaks volumes that a celluloid character such as Mima manages to become more lifelike and sympathetic than any sillicone tarts Hollywood chucks around the screen). It's hardly uncommon to see a genre such as a psychological stalker-thriller treated in animation to the Japanese. Heck, they've done every other imaginable thing under the sun in animation, and a damn good job they do at it as well. It's just a shame that hardly any of the really good stuff ever makes it over to the West, thus creating a distorted image for casual western viewers. We do seem to have made some progress from the Akira Aftertaste years, where anime was generally put on the same line as sex and violence and very little else (side-step; how come nobody ever raises a finger when live Yank actors engage in orgies of the most brutal porn and bloodshed in just about every Hollywood flick ever made, but the whole world screams bloody murder when an anime character so much as takes his socks off? Live Yanks can get away with everything?). Now it's anime is just pink-haired fairies in giant explosive turbo robots. They're getting just a tiny bit warmer, but maybe Perfect Blue will get the message across to a few others that anime embraces a diversity that ranges from Sailor Moon to Wings of Honneamise (and I'm just globally sketching here), with a reasonably large number of people getting to actually see this. A quite decent English dub that doesn't hamper the film too much is also a plus, though a dub will of course never equal the original. It might help to keep the above paragraph in mind for a Perfect Blue viewer not initiated to the big picture of anime. In any case, it's an impressive movie for anyone, worth seeing for being so unique, gripping and masterfully scary. I'll think twice before I look into a mirror for a long time to come after this...A final note about the notorious comment that this could be a Disney-Hitchcock hybrid.

The leitmotiv of a second self also intrigues me, and I found it delightful trying to pick out which Mima was really the real one. Just how strong is false Mima's presence in reality? Is she a complete phantom of the imagination, or does she have a litteral, physical presence of some kind? And most of all; out of these two versions of herself, which one does Mima really want to be? If you can't tell for sure what does and doesn't really happen, you also might not take everything the characters declare for granted. The ending does provide a somewhat logical explanation that ties up all of the insanity again, but that doesn't mean the fun of figuring this out for yourself is completely spoiled; you can very well not take the ending entirely for granted either (while it makes sense, there are some bits about the explanation it provides that don't completely gel with me). Lots of re-watchings and picking apart of hints is in store for me there. Love it when that happens ^^.A few tiny niggles; the animation quality in the first half of the film is not quite breathtaking, and seemed decidedly below-par for movie quality animation. Luckily, it picks up later on, becoming pleasingly smooth. And by the time you reach the terror of the later part of the film, you're already too frightened to really be picky about animation quality. Some of the violent and\/or explicit scenes are very nasty indeed (ewww, straight people, sick man), but they serve the purpose of enhancing the fright factor very well, rather than just being needless grotesqueries to please the gore-junkies in the style of that hideous Akira. The film is a complete success as a frightening, surreal and involving thriller (though I do still like Jinn-Roh much better).But another reason to rejoice is that Perfect Blue is a step in the right direction for the general public's image of what anime really is. Sure, the enlightened few among us for whom Evangelion is standard fare, and who can give detailed insights into the latest CLAMP titles already know that anime is not a genre. It's a medium in itself, and the Japanese animation market can, and does treat every imaginable genre and subject, often with skill that leaves feeble Hollywoodian efforts miles behind itself (in the case of Perfect Blue, it speaks volumes that a celluloid character such as Mima manages to become more lifelike and sympathetic than any sillicone tarts Hollywood chucks around the screen). It's hardly uncommon to see a genre such as a psychological stalker-thriller treated in animation to the Japanese. Heck, they've done every other imaginable thing under the sun in animation, and a damn good job they do at it as well. It's just a shame that hardly any of the really good stuff ever makes it over to the West, thus creating a distorted image for casual western viewers. We do seem to have made some progress from the Akira Aftertaste years, where anime was generally put on the same line as sex and violence and very little else (side-step; how come nobody ever raises a finger when live Yank actors engage in orgies of the most brutal porn and bloodshed in just about every Hollywood flick ever made, but the whole world screams bloody murder when an anime character so much as takes his socks off? Live Yanks can get away with everything?). Now it's anime is just pink-haired fairies in giant explosive turbo robots. They're getting just a tiny bit warmer, but maybe Perfect Blue will get the message across to a few others that anime embraces a diversity that ranges from Sailor Moon to Wings of Honneamise (and I'm just globally sketching here), with a reasonably large number of people getting to actually see this. A quite decent English dub that doesn't hamper the film too much is also a plus, though a dub will of course never equal the original. It might help to keep the above paragraph in mind for a Perfect Blue viewer not initiated to the big picture of anime. In any case, it's an impressive movie for anyone, worth seeing for being so unique, gripping and masterfully scary. I'll think twice before I look into a mirror for a long time to come after this...A final note about the notorious comment that this could be a Disney-Hitchcock hybrid. Hitch perhaps, but comparing this kind of quality to Disney's paper-flat commercial slop is simply an insult to Perfect Blue.

Get it at Amazon.)It doesn't take a movie connoisseur to see that this is a stage play filmed.So what? The play is a work of genius--it won a Pulitzer Prize--and the cast is about as good as you can get. Jack Lemmon gives a performance that will tear your heart out...well, if you're like any of the characters in the play, you have no heart! And Al Pacino gets to put the pedal to the metal and fire on all cylinders. He is great when he's screaming, and he's even better when he's handing out buddy-buddy BS philosophy. Kevin Spacey as John Williamson, the boss of the boiler room crew, has the skin of a rhino and the heart of a baboon. Incidentally, the language is foul, fouler and foulest, and indeed, poor David Mamet, who wrote the play and adapted it for the screen, ran out of expletives. I mean how many ways can you suggest that someone perform impossible acts upon themselves? Yet, considering the moral fiber of the characters, the language seemed not inappropriate.Indeed, Mamet is a master of dialogue and some of the set pieces are just marvels. The exchange between Dave Moss (Ed Harris) and George Aaronow (Alan Arkin) as Moss leads up to his plan to steal the precious 'leads' is like a ping pong match done as a pas de deux. And the harangue by Alec Baldwin as the brass...endowed motivational speaker was a crack up.This is an extraordinarily intense film, so intense if you watch carefully you can see first Jack Lemmon and then Al Pacino so fired up and wildly expressive that spit comes out of their mouths along with the words. (I've done that.) In fact, all the actors feed off of one another. Being on the set must have been just an amazing experience with everyone trying to outdo everyone else. The timing alone is worth the ticket.Note that no women grace the screen. I mean zero. This is a war flick with con artists in the trenches. Note also how carefully plotted the story is. Mamet thought it out and worked and reworked it so that everything fits. For example when 'The Machine' Levene makes his little slip revealing that he knew that the Roma contract had not been sent, we can immediately fill in the details realizing that Dave Moss had gotten to him with his cowardly scheme. And when Levene learns that his miraculous $82,000 sale is to crazies who have no money and just like to talk to salesmen, we see how perfectly ironic that is, and how tragic, like the life of Willy Loman in Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman. We can also see, if we really want to look beyond the movie, that Jack Lemmon's interpretation of Levene owes something to Willy Loman as does Mamet's creation. I have seen Jack Lemmon in many things, beginning with Mr. Roberts (1955) through Some Like It Hot (1959) to Grumpy Old Men (1993) and he has been wonderful, one of the great stars of the silver screen, but I don't think I've ever seen him more convincing than here. All the other actors in this film also have done larger pieces and had more demanding roles, but I'll bet they seldom had more fun.You don't want to miss this movie. It is one of a kind. The cynicism is palpable and the desperation so humanly demeaning that it's almost funny.

There is no doubt that this is a movie for people who like to think about and explore what lies behind our lives. But unfortunately some people just can't help but use a movie like this to pat themselves on the back, snub their noses and say things like, Although this movie lags  conversations I've had by six months, it is still very interesting Similarly, another criticism is that the philosophical meat of this movie was unoriginal. Yes, most of what was discussed has probably been said or thought many times before, but not by everyone. To criticize Waking Life for being unoriginal is to miss the point. This movie was meant to coalesce a broad range of provocative thoughts into a singular, rambling piece of impressionistic art. Just like many people initially looked at Monet's work and said it was rubbish that could have been painted by a bad child artist, so will people criticize this film for being devoid of plot and originality because it is a different kind of movie. People are used to being spoon-fed big heaping mouthfuls of sugar and vinegar; hence the popularity of  Serendipity and 13 Ghosts. In contrast, this is a movie that tosses out small jewels, some that you will not catch because you will linger over the one before, until the end gives you a vague vision of reality, the whole that is the true plot.  There are several levels of the film, some of which I know I didn't see. First, it is a stunningly beautiful vision. The animation technique does mirror and modify what is being said, but it can be enjoyed immensely by itself. Second, the film is a sampling of provocative thoughts about what it means to be alive and what it means to be awake (versus in a dream). Third, it is a catalyst for us all to personally explore these topics. It is a mark of any good film that when we leave we continue to talk and think about the topics that were raised, but this film brings us to the next level. Like a catalyst it acts to speed up our thoughts on the topic and allows us to explore in ways that previously we could not.  Ultimately it is about inverses, and is itself an inverse. Characters espouse the value of guns and end up shooting each other. It is set on land that is in constant motion like the sea. Dead people think they are alive and live people think they are dead. It is about dreaming but is called Waking Life.
