[{"date":"16 August 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Faithful adaptation of the 1940's classic The Shop Around the Corner, only now two strangers communicate through e-mails, rather than conventional mail. Due to their anonymous identities, each converses with honesty and vulnerability. They are acquainted in their real lives, but neither is aware of this. Because both parties have adopted defensive exteriors that hide who they really are, they wind up becoming hostile adversaries personally and professionally.Routine rom-com approaches are readily visible, but Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks display so much chemistry, that you're ready to overlook these old plot devices. Example they open the film each dating a cold, ambitious career-driven person who is obviously wrong for them. Through their interaction over e-mail, the characters change, and their real-life personalities begin to draw together as well. Of course, like any movie of the genre, we gradually progress to a predictable feel-good conclusion.There are two wonderfully sentimental scenes, the first one with Kathleen Kelly (Ryan) in dream sequence reminiscing about her childhood; second, a scene where a golden oldy song from a classic '30's movie punctuates the emotion of the two characters (and conveys their thoughts better than dialog could). The script gives Hanks and Ryan some clever dialog to have some fun with, especially in the latter stages of the movie.If you like the rom-com genre, or the Ryan\/Hanks pairing, this movie is a pleasant treat.

From the publication of Bram Stoker's novel in 1897, it has succeeded in evoking fear and terror into the hearts and minds of the millions who read the Gothic magnum opus. There have been many adaptations of the Dracula story; F.W Murnau's German expressionist masterpiece, Bela Lugosi's elegant and sublime portrayal and Christopher Lee's various 'fangtastic' performances.But for me the most faithful and best movie adaptation of the Bram Stoker novel is without a doubt 1992's aptly named 'Bram Stoker's Dracula'. With Francis Ford Coppola at the helm, what could go wrong? The movie was fabulous, visually stunning and capturing all the various aspects of the Dracula myth; the dark, Gothic horror and romantic sympathetic cruelty of Dracula's fate. And the cast was also fantastic with Gary Oldman doing a great job at the very complex and difficult role of Dracula and Anthony Hopkin's brilliant portrayal of his nemesis Professor Abraham Van Helsing. Winona Ryder was wonderful as Mina Murray as was Richard E Grant and Sadie Frost as Dr. Jack Seward and Lucy Westerner respectively. But the only disappointment was Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker. What horrible casting! Reeves' performance was drab and boring from his first terrible lines of dialogue, pulling off a hopeless English accent and making himself look the idiot acting opposite such distinguished actors as Oldman and Hopkins. Despite this little hitch, I felt that 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' was absolutely brilliant, with exceptional performances (minus Keanu), a great script and Coppola's usual genius as a director, this is one the best films of all time. I loved this movie.
