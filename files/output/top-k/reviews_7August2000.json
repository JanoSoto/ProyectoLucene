The Hollow Man is a Sci-Fi Thriller, What else did you want them to do with the movie, did you want Kevin Bacon to turn into a pig and go to the market? Would you rate it higher then, the producer did everything he could to keep the movie as realistic as he could and he did. People, you went to see an invisible movie, that means everything is up for grabs, for instance, look at The Sixth Sense, most of you people love that story.. Tell me what was so good about that? I found nothing, i wasn't Thrilled about anything in that movie and if you check out the front cover of the movie it's suppose to be the #1 thriller of 99, hahah Rubbish... Other than the upstairs scene in the movie that was the only thing that got my sub par attention. And the ending of that movie was so realistic my roommate and I had guessed that half way through the movie. I was far more intrigued with the hollow man, i was actually scared three times in this movie that got me out of my chair, the last time I can remember that happened is when Freddy Kruger came out of the closet in one of the past episodes. The problem with viewers these days is they expect to much of a film, I have taken courses at college on Film Genre, and Media arts, so i know how people react to certain things. The only thing i can see what happened with this movie is people expected way too much from it, all the critics bashed it from the get go and then all the people followed suit...And for people to say the ending is predictible go watch any horror movie and you pretty much can predict It. I can see no way in the blue moon that Space Cowboys could get a higher rating than The Hollow Man, except for Star Power. And as far as my views i wouldnt go see 3 old timers anymore, I want the hottest stars in the world. and hottest isnt Eastwood, Sutherland, and Cromwell, the last time Eastwood made a good movie was like Dirty Harry, True Crime is the worst of all time and Deep Blue Sea With Sutherland was a complete joke. Bacon (Stir of Echoes) and Shue (Leaving Las Vegas) are two stars worthy of this role. But as usual like my friend Jenna told me if Brad Pitt would have played the role of Sebastian she would have went right away, just to see Certain Scenes that happened later in the movie. Sex and Invisibility sells as it shows that the hollow man reached number 1 at the box office and Space Cowboys had enough trouble selling tickets to go see it.. But this is always how it will be now of days, when was the last time that people wanted to see a true horror\/sci fi movie? Ever since Freddy and Jason left the scene movies have gotten worse and worse.. we have Spice Girl movies now for the love of god ;) I can almost predict that 1\/4 of the people who voted the movie lower and who have a dvd player, will buy the DVD when it comes out since they will show more about the special effects and delete scenes from the movie, possibly an Alternate Ending.... Any way you look at it The Hollow Man Hit # 1 on the Box Office so it proves that people wanted to see this movie, this movie will continue it's reign and dethrown the Sixth Sense as best movie that has come out of August in Along time!

I doubt there is anything I could say about this movie that would do it justice and that others haven't already said better than I, so i'll just mention a few of the things that make me keep on coming back for more.So many to chose from... well, there is the shark, of coarse. Brilliant move by Spielberg in not showing it until the third act. In fact, the scenes where you don't see him are scarier, like the guy that gets knocked off his boat in the pond, where we get our first glimpse of the shark gliding under the water towards him and pulling him under. Frightening. The cast, Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw are incredible. Shaw totally steals every scene he's in. This has to be one of the most quoted films in pop culture with lines like, We're gonna need a bigger boat, This was no boating accident! It wasn't any propellor, it wasn't any coral reef and it wasn't Jack the Ripper. It was a shark, Uh, I think it's clear that you are going to ignore this particular problem until it swims up and bites you in the ass!, and just about everything Robert Shaw says. Every bit of praise this movie has recieved it has earned.I happened upon the latest release of the film recently. The 25th anniversary edition, complete with a making of, deleted scenes and outakes. Definately money well spent, even if you already own it, run out and buy this on video or DVD. What makes it worth it? Well, the scene with Quint going to the music shop to buy piano wire is worth the price of admission alone, I laughed so hard! The making of feature was filled with juicy facts, including Spielberg setting the record straight on who actually wrote the famous (and brilliant) U.S.S. Indianapolis speech delivered by Shaw, a scene that almost every writer working in Hollywood at that time has taken credit for at one time or another. And with good reason, it's a memorable one. I loved every minute of it. This movie is a classic no matter how you cut it. 10\/10 stars, and worth every one! G'night!

In fact, the scenes where you don't see him are scarier, like the guy that gets knocked off his boat in the pond, where we get our first glimpse of the shark gliding under the water towards him and pulling him under. Frightening. The cast, Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw are incredible. Shaw totally steals every scene he's in. This has to be one of the most quoted films in pop culture with lines like, We're gonna need a bigger boat, This was no boating accident! It wasn't any propellor, it wasn't any coral reef and it wasn't Jack the Ripper. It was a shark, Uh, I think it's clear that you are going to ignore this particular problem until it swims up and bites you in the ass!, and just about everything Robert Shaw says. Every bit of praise this movie has recieved it has earned.I happened upon the latest release of the film recently. The 25th anniversary edition, complete with a making of, deleted scenes and outakes. Definately money well spent, even if you already own it, run out and buy this on video or DVD. What makes it worth it? Well, the scene with Quint going to the music shop to buy piano wire is worth the price of admission alone, I laughed so hard! The making of feature was filled with juicy facts, including Spielberg setting the record straight on who actually wrote the famous (and brilliant) U.S.S. Indianapolis speech delivered by Shaw, a scene that almost every writer working in Hollywood at that time has taken credit for at one time or another. And with good reason, it's a memorable one.

Any Questions?) but it seems to sum things up for me. Kinda says it all- even if I never saw any advertising or read any reviews for the film, I've been waiting for this movie based solely on that premise.  This is probably the most fun I've had in a movie so far this year. I am a big blaxploitation fan (though I have to admit, I haven't seen Superfly or the original Shaft, I love the genre) and Jackson is an actor that I will watch a mediocre movie just to see-especially if he plays a bad-ass.I won't bother giving a plot sypnosis, except to point out that Jackson portrays not the original 70's Shaft, but Shaft's nephew, which I thought was a brilliant touch. The best part of that is, Richard Roundtree gets to reprise his role as the original, and they have some great scenes together. Some people have complained that Roundtree wasn't in the film enough. Though I wouldn't have minded if he'd been around more, I thought he had just the right amount of screen time and scenes. My favorite was when he visited a party thrown in Shaft's honor, has a nice talk with him, then leaves the Lenox Lounge with a foxy chick on each arm and a big smile on his face (not to mention being dressed to the nines). Besides, this movie belongs to Jackson, and he owns it completely. Though he's done many memorable roles, I think this will be the one he's remembered for.The supporting cast is great -Christian Bale and Jeffrey Wright both play thoroughly unlikeable yet entertaining bad guys, with Bale as a spoiled, racist yuppie and Wright as a drug dealer with an accent that makes Al Pacino's in Scarface sound whitebread. This is a pretty testosterone-filled movie (not that there's anything wrong with that )so there's not an especially strong female supporting cast, but the women in the film are great. Gloria Rueben of ER has a nice cameo that I'm sure most actresses would have played for free, short though it is-hell, they probably could have auctioned the small role she has off to the highest bidder. My only complaint is that they didn't get Pam Grier for a cameo- she would have been great in Vanessa L. William's role, but even more perfect as the bartender in the party scene.There's not enough room for me to list all the things I loved about the movie & admired the filmmakers for doing. However, some of the top ones would be the fact that they use the ORIGINAL Isaac Hayes theme and not some horrible 'updated for the new millennium' remix, the way Shaft is especially p***ed off by abuse of women and children, Busta Rhymes as Shaft's comic-relief sidekick, the fact that none of the good guys in the film ever refer to a woman as bitches or ho's, the way no theme or scene seems 'dated' (sadly, even today an interracial couple trying to have a nice evening on the town will still have to deal with racism) and the exceptionally satisfying way all the nasty characters get what is coming to them- justice is definitely served in the end. Man, I hope they make this into a franchise - the crowd-pleasing epilogue, with the theme music kicking in, definitely leaves room for one.I'm ripping off this comment from another review I read, but I have to repeat it I'd happily pay the price of admission just to see Jackson read the phone book for 2 hours as this character. Needless to say, the movie is much more exciting than that. Action scenes are great, the plot was fine, even including  twists I didn't expect, and the dialogue was perfect.  Jackson reportedly had some arguments with the filmmakers over the character, mainly over how he treats women-reportedly,a scene was cut at his request with him tossing a candy bar to a woman he's just slept with after she complains that he never takes her out to dinner. Going to see the movie, I was a tiny bit concerned- as a lot of other fans probably were- that he would turn into too much a caring, sharing watered-down Shaft, but no-one needed to worry. It would have kind of detracted from the character to see him hopping into bed with a different chick constantly throughout the movie like James Bond. One of the few referencesto Shaft's sex life is also probably my favorite line in the movie- though it was hard to pick, this is the one that made up my mind to purchase the movie when it is for sale. A good-looking female bartender, lonely not just for sex but for someone to hold her, is about to hook up with Shaft at the end of the party scene, telling him among other things that it has been a long time. Shaft gives her a nice slow smile and replies as only Samuel L. Jackson can You know me...It's my duty to please that booty.Any Questions?

I love Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson's focus on underachievers; it's very refreshing, honest, and sincere.  The people in this movie aren't glamorous movie stars with perfect bodies and sharp minds, but at the same time they're not depressingly unmotivated drug addicts either; they're utterly mediocre individuals and are very interesting because of it.  In particular, Owen Wilson's character is very interesting because, although he is a total underachiever, he thinks he is destined for great things--and rather than ridiculing him, like a conventional comedy may have done, the filmmakers have chosen instead to sympathize with him, or at least to portray him in an unbiased light.  In other words, he's depicted as a human being rather than a comic relief device.  All the characters in the film are very humorous, but they never feel like they're just funny factories that churn out one pre-fabricated joke after another without having any personality or emotional complexity.As with Rushmore, the soundtrack to this movie is awesome.If you like films with strong plots that really motivate the story, though, you might not like this.

I have to say, first of all, that I totally agree with the person who said that you SHOULD ALSO READ THE NOVEL.

I totally DISAGREE that Boorman did a crappy job of directing or that this film in ANY WAY stinks. The first time that I saw this is when it came out in 1972. In judging this picture, you need to remember that societal expectations were a LOT different (in America) than they are today. EVERYONE was talking about the rape scene in this movie. NO ONE had filmed something like that, that I know of - or that I remember anyone else ever having heard of being in a movie at that time. Most probably, the issue hadn't been addressed within a novel, either - until Dickie wrote this. I was 14 when I snuck in to see this - and it had an impact even though I knew what was coming. I'd read the book right after seeing it - and, again, it's MUCH more involved and dramatic. A few years ago, I took a course called The Male In American Literature and was surprised and pleased to find that Deliverance was on the syllabus as one of the stories we'd be studying. In re-reading this as an adult (and after a higher education) there were many things I had never noticed before. Dickie uses a LOT OF foreshadowing in the story - right down to something that no one else in the class noticed, but I did the color orange is often associated with caution and he mentions it a whole lot of times. I went back and watched the movie again, as well - it had been many years since I had first seen it. I did notice what another reviewer mentions here - that you never do see the identity of that other person in the tow truck - and I mentioned to my friend that for the first time I thought it was those same guys who were involved in accosting the canoeing party further downriver. Someone else mentions here (in these reviews) about how the kid who had played Dueling Banjoes with Drew doesn't even acknowledge him when they are passing under him, under the bridge. Again - foreshadowing - another subtle hint that something terrible is about to happen. I don't think that this story - whether the book or the novel - is a bad one at all. I agree totally with the person who said that there are much deeper elements at work here. If you thought the movie stunk, read the book - then go back and give the movie another chance.

But we all have our own baggage in life, don't we?

There's NO comparison in literary value, so to speak. I debated asking for my money back from renting the tape.

It is simply a wonderful combination of inventive film-making, a great story, and absolutely wonderful acting (and casting, for that matter).I'm not sure I've ever seen a film where every actor in the cast was this good, especially an ensemble cast. The absolute best scenes are the dialogue that occurs between Spacey (who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar, but has the most screentime of anyone) and Chazz Palmintieri, who is really in his element as a tough-guy cop. He never seemed to feel right in numerous bad guy roles, and he  gives a great performance here as what I would term the most moral character. There are a number of underappreciated actors who are excellent here. I've always been a big fan of Kevin Pollak, and this is by far his best dramatic role. The sam can be said of Stephen Baldwin, who luckily found time to be in this this between such forgettable films as Bio-Dome. It was nice to see Giancarlo Esposito, who's another guy that deserves more acclaim. Dan Hedaya, who has had one of the stranger acting careers in recent memory (remember Nick Tortelli on Cheers?) is fine in a bit role.

The green Mile is a great example of showing the worst and the best in human nature all in one fell swoop.  Of course it is impossible to steer clear of comparison to the Shawshank Redemption, especially as it is directed by Darabont who accomplished to make one of the greatest films of all time. The green mile is arguably not as good as Shawshank Redemption but it is a prison drama told from a completely different angle and that is why one is not disappointed when watching it.  It has very sentimental moments and it has a certain self-congratulatory and self-conscious feel when it comes to relationship between Coffey and all the good white folk in the sense of look how sensitive we are handling the race issue.  The role of John Coffey is well portrayed and I love the way you can speculate about where he came from and how old he really is but the film does sometimes fall into sentimentality that evokes resistance to the fantastic story being told. Tom Hanks is reliable as ever in a story that would put anyone off the death penalty but then decides to change its mind in the end by condoning the death penalty after all but only for very, very, bad people.So all in all a good movie that doesn't particularly linger on in memory mainly due to the deliberate tugging at heart strings.

The green mile is arguably not as good as Shawshank Redemption but it is a prison drama told from a completely different angle and that is why one is not disappointed when watching it.  It has very sentimental moments and it has a certain self-congratulatory and self-conscious feel when it comes to relationship between Coffey and all the good white folk in the sense of look how sensitive we are handling the race issue.  The role of John Coffey is well portrayed and I love the way you can speculate about where he came from and how old he really is but the film does sometimes fall into sentimentality that evokes resistance to the fantastic story being told. Tom Hanks is reliable as ever in a story that would put anyone off the death penalty but then decides to change its mind in the end by condoning the death penalty after all but only for very, very, bad people.So all in all a good movie that doesn't particularly linger on in memory mainly due to the deliberate tugging at heart strings.

No violence, no sex, no drugs. Just real problems (loneliness, routine, betrayal) and real joy (friendship, compassion and love). Sometimes it seems a light comedy, but for example while smiling you see people coming from different places having the same dreams and the same sensibility and caring for the big issues of life. The sequences in Venice have a comic book style so far from tourist perception of world's most beautiful city and it's the same contrast with consumer action movies you will find in this movie.
