At the time the graphics were not dated in any way shape or form.  Where is VR today? I recently bought the DVD and after watching it and remembering that it was an eight (8) year old movie, I still enjoyed it.  I have seen a few VR games in arcades and to be honest the graphics today aren't much better than they were in this movie.

While I don't think I reveal too much about the story or anything, I want to make sure I don't ruin it for anyone.Okay, this movie is EXACTLY what I expected.  I was a huge fan of the cartoon (and of Get Smart as well) as a young child, and had some hopes for this film.  I expected the kid stuff, it is, after all, a Disney movie, but that was outweighed by the thrill of seeing the Inspector himself in live action.  I felt that the time I spent on this movie was well worth it, as it brought back the fun I remembered about the series.  My comments below may seem a little on the harsh side, but I DID like the movie, I just have a tendency to see where I think things could have been done better.First off, the praise.  The special effects were pretty seamless and entertaining, put in where they should be, but the cinematography was wonderful!  The atmosphere in any given scene is exactly what it should be. Especially of note is the scene toward the beginning with Claw's limo being chased by Brown.  The lighting and camera angles are just what they should be.  The sets deserve just as much commendation.  The modern looking city was just enough cartoonish to fit with the movie, but not so much as to be unbelievable.The casting was pretty much on target.  Matthew Broderick provided a well enough Gadget, however he needed a little more development.  He goes from champion of justice to bumbling idiot just a little to quickly.  These aspects should have been blended a little more.  Rupert Everett played a perfectly diabolical Claw, but where was his CLAW?  Not this robot grasping thing he has here, but the metal glove CLAW?Now I come to Andy Dick.  What happened there?  Andy Dick, usually a very exuberant and fun actor suddenly becomes understated?  I ask, why?  His role provided some laughs, but not nearly enough as there should have been.  He should have been allowed to cut loose.  Well, there's always the sequel.Everyone else does a pretty good job, though, with the little material they had.  Dabney Coleman and Cheri Oteri needed way more screen time than they got, as their's were the most enjoyable characters.  Michelle Trachtenberg played Penny very well, but her role as the one who always saves Gadget from his own idiocy wasn't there as it should have been.  In fact, I can't think of anything really important she did to influence the finale (except for the Minions Anonymous scene).  Joely Fisher did a good job, but the Robo version of her was unnecessary.  And, of course, Rene Auberjonois is always fun to see (Odo from DS9 for non-Trekkies).Okay, now down to the REAL complaints.  The Gadgetmobile.  At the very least, its screentime should have been cut by two-thirds.  D.L. Hughley was not the right choice for the voice either.  In my opinion, THIS is where Don Adams should have been, not in a ten-second scene during the credits.  I get upset just thinking of the jokes that would have been possible between Broderick and Adams as the Gadgetmobile.  Alas, that was not to be.  Also, the CGI figure that represented the GM on the dashboard should have been eliminated, along with the literally blinking headlights.  In fact, unless Adams was there, the GM should have been eliminated altogether.Length.  An hour and eighteen minutes just doesn't cut it.  The movie should have been expanded and more screentime given to the costars of the TV show, namely Penny, Brain, and Chief Quimby.Plot.  Not enough.  Tell us WHY Claw wants these armies of Robomen!  His net worth is over 10 billion dollars, so what can these Roboguys do for him that 10 billion smackers can't?  The Robo-Gadget.  Good idea, but maybe should have been toned down in terms of cuteness.  He should have been a tad more menacing.  And how in the world did Gadget come back to life without that chip thingie?  I don't buy that.  I think Andy Dick's character got him a new one and Gadget was faking being dead to get a kiss.The jokes, and a lot of the movie overall, were too much on the kiddy side. Movies can be made that appeal to adults and kids.  Disney themselves proved this with Toy Story and it's worthy sequel.  Some of that cross-generational humor could have been well used here.Overall, as a prequel to the TV series, this wasn't too bad.  If you liked the old show, check it out.  The flaws can be overlooked if you try hard enough.  Anyway, like I said above, there's always the sequel.Go-Go Gadget!

Having read the book(s), I was expecting a bit of a let down in the movie.  For the first time in my life, however, I saw a movie that made me wish that I had not read the book before viewing.  Not that the book(s) was not great, but the movie and its performances were phenomenal. There are a great number of highly anticipated films coming out between now and Christmas, but I can confidently say that this movie will no doubt get a nomination for Best Picture.  Knowing that the award is generally pre-disposed to the whims of Academy members, I will not say it will win Best Picture, though it probably should.  Tom Hanks will be up against some very stiff competition for Best Actor ( Kevin Spacey, Jim Carrey, Tom Cruise, etc.), but he should be nominated for Best Actor again.  He probably won't win because he has two Best Actor awards already.  That said, if Michael Duncan (the big black guy who played Bear in Armageddon) doesn't win Best Supporting Actor then I may never go see another movie.  He is incredible. There are also great performances from David Morse, James Cromwell, Sam Rockwell, and Barry Pepper (Jackson from Saving Private Ryan). The Movie will also probably win Best Adapted Screenplay because it takes over 600 pages of highly detailed written material and doesn't miss anything important.  I highly recommend this movie.  Its 3 hrs and 5 minutes long, but its worth every minute.  As always with Stephen King type adaptations, pay attention to everything, because everything matters.  I hate to say that movies are in my personal Top 10 without seeing them 5 to 50 times, but The Green Mile certainly appears to be headed toward this prestigious title, and Hanks has solidified his position as the best actor of our generation.

Not that the book(s) was not great, but the movie and its performances were phenomenal. There are a great number of highly anticipated films coming out between now and Christmas, but I can confidently say that this movie will no doubt get a nomination for Best Picture.

I expect the film to have all the cliches of the genre which I know and love. I expect the film to have gratuitous nudity and a totally unnecessary female sidekick who falls in love with the hero in a second for no reason what so ever. And the most important thing I expect Gratuitous, strong violence!Universal Soldier The Return fills this order quite nicely. Van Damme doesn't have the amazing screen presence of Steven Seagal but his fight scenes are fun to watch. And as we all know, he can't act. The plot is totally predictable and filled with cliches (although I prefer the tough renegade cop kills the bad guys who murdered his partner-plot, this will do). A scene in a strip bar is always welcome in a film like this. And there are a few fairly good fights. Especially the last fight between Van Damme and Jai White is surprisingly good.So a 10 out of 10, then? Well, not quite. Given the director Mic Rodgers' background as stunt co-ordinator, the stunts here are surprisingly generic. Also, the fight scenes (with the exception of the Van Damme\/Jai White-fight) are over way too quickly and are surprisingly tame for a film like this. There are no bone-breakings, no brutal moves, nothing that would make a teenager yell Yeah! (and an older fan like myself to think Yeah! although not yelling it out loud). Just the normal kicking and punching and while that's fun to watch, you are left waiting for the brutal final move and never get it. Also, the score by Don Davis is disappointing and the heavy-rock played during some action sequences is distracting. Blade, for example, had excellent techno during it's brilliant fights and I think the same approach would have worked here.Universal Soldier The Return is clearly a low-budget film. The sets look surprisingly cheap, some of the effects are pretty bad and even the prop guns look kinda goofy. And although this is one of the only martial arts-based actioners released theatrically (I want more!), this does have direct-to-video written all over it.Make no mistakes about it, this is definitely one of the year's dumbest films. It has no artistic merit at all, almost no-one in it can act, it is filled with cliches and it even looks cheap. But these days when many people want to blame the movie violence for their own lack of parenting skills, it's refreshing to see a film which is based on action and violence and makes no apologies for it. Real-life violence is disgusting but well-choreographed over-the-top fights in movies are fun.  And although Universal Soldier The Return is way below the best actioners I've seen, I still enjoyed it a lot and I recommend it to people who enjoy mindless violence.

Cheers to Sam Mendel and Alan Ball. ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"8 December 1999","score":"","review":"  This movie is like looking into a mirror. You are faced with making hard decisions everyday, thinking of how you are going to make it, without being physically, and mentally, tortured by the sickness of it all.American Beauty is a fully-flexed simulation of what the world is like, outside of the movie screen. We all see what this, beauty is like, we just do not want to admit it. The acting portrayed simplistic behavior of someone who cannot take the pain. Kevin Spacey seemed to reach that point well with his superb acting skills. Annette Bening reflected her mother-like personality as the typical, over-the-edge mom who has completley lost it. Thora Birch expressed teenage emptyness. She knew, somewhere in herself, that a normal teenager, acts like how Jane Burnham acts.

And most people are praising this move.  That's good because I am too.This movie was funny as hell, can I say that.  Anyway, next week > is finals week for me and with all the studying I have this movie came right on time.  I watch the show as much as possible but I won't consider myself a true fan.  Maybe I didn't catch all the trademarks of the show but who cares, this movie was outrageous.  Satan\/Sadaam relationship (funny), the guy that goes UMKAY had me dying with that song, (funnyx2), but the Uncle F**ker song took the cake (classic funny).  While I was listening to Uncle F**ker I couldn't believe they was actually saying that.  However I do think they went a little overboard with the tunes.  It felt like a vulgar Disney cartoon afterwhile but I didn't care because it took my mind off those d*mn finals.No one should be offended, just have a good time.  I'm black and the scene with Chef ducking the Canadian bombs almost made me spit up my Sprite.  Overall this movie just allows good ol' fashion fun.  And even though it came on last night (on our student run cable station) I hope it play again tonight, UMKAY!
