[{"date":"13 July 2014","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Pedal to the metal, Commander! I have to say this comic sci-fi parody film is hilarious. Directed by Dean Parisot, and written by David Howard & Robert Gordon. The film is about a troupe of cast actors of a once-popular television Sci-Fi\/Star Trek homage\/parody spoof series called Galaxy Quest who been call upon to defend a group of aliens against an alien warlord, Sarris (Robin Sachs) when mistaken as real heroes. The acting is awesome in this movie, all the cast members of Galaxy Quest really were well-written. This is one of the few, Tim Allen's movies that I didn't find stupid or bothersome. He was awesome, as Jason Nesmith, the actor who played Cmdr. Peter Quincy Taggart, the captain of the Protector on the fictional series. He really does command the scenes in which, he is in. He's looks like he's having a blast with this role. Sigourney Weaver as Gwen DeMarco was pretty damn sexy! It's nice, seeing her in a Sci-Fi movie, besides Alien, where she can show her feminine side. Alan Rickman as Alexander Dane, the actor who played alien Dr. Lazarus. A trained Shakespearean British actor, Alexander resents both his catchphrase and being typecast. This was the movie that help Alan Rickman get the role for the Professor Snape, Harry Potter series. You really see it, here. Tony Shalhoub as Lt. Chen, the character is obviously stoned the whole time. He was funny as hell. I love all the characters, but my favorite had to be Sam Rockwell as Sam Rockwell as Guy Fleegman, an actor who had a minor role as a disposable character like a redshirt from Star Trek. He wasn't irritating to watch, when he always fretting about his imminent demise since how minor, he is to, the main show. If Sam Rockwell wasn't the actor, that help made this character, this character might indeed, be pretty awful annoying. 'We got to get out of here before somebody kills Guy!' What a great line. Even the actors that play the aliens, were great. The continuous melodic yet monotone voice of Thermian Commander Mathesar (Enrico Colantoni) was remarkable. This was also, actor Rain Wilson's first movie, so look for his cameo. The only actor, I wish, he wasn't in this film was Justin Long as Brandon, a devoted Galaxy Quest fan with an encyclopedic knowledge of the show. In my opinion, a better actor, could make this film, better. The film originally received an R rating, before being re-cut due to harsh language, extreme violence and drug use. Honestly, you don't really see much of it in the PG, but hints to it, like Gwen mouthing the F-word or Lt. Chen always eating in most of his scenes. I think the movie works with a PG rating. Its shows that you can make clever jokes, without crude language, or being over sexual. Still, there are some frighten things that might scare, children, like aliens being killed off, torture, or decapitated. The whole teleporter accident scene was a bit gross, but funny. Some people think the movie was too crude on the fans of sci-fi. In my opinion, the story playfully pokes fun at Trekkies while still maintaining their ability to honor the genre. It even got the blessing of Star Trek actors. The good reviews weren't limited to Trek actors either; virtually every actor who's worked in sci-fi treats it as a good film. The visual & special effects were just as good. Despite the movie having great CGI for the 1990s, there was still room for Stan Winston's work. I was deeply surprise to hear that he work on this film. If you take away the humor, you still come out with a great Sci-Fi experience. Great actions scenes that play homage to certain episodes and movies such as Episode, #1, season 1, 'Arena, Season #2, Episode 6 'The Doomsday Machine', Season #2, Episode 22, 'By Any Other Name' and others from the Star Trek TV show. There are homage to the films as well, like 1982's Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan. The rock monster was homage to 1989's Star Trek V The Final Frontier, in which William Shatner wanting to fight with, but was cut in that movie due to budget reasons. The scene when Tim Allen is in a men's room overhearing how the cast of Galaxy Quest are nobodies and all the co-stars can't stand him mirrors an actual event in William Shatner's life attending a Star Trek convention. It's really a touching scene. The movie does have a lot of emotional scenes that mixed well with the comedy.The plot remind me of a mix of 1986's Â¡Three Amigos! , which is nice. The movie sound track is just beautiful to listen to. Compose by David Newman. The DVD is just as great. Look for the Galaxy Quest E! Mockumentary, there. There is a feature on the DVD simulating the Omega 13, by reversing the opening sequence to the main menu. That was pretty cool. Some editions have an alternate audio track in which the dialogue is spoken in the Thermians' language, except for one English word spoken by an alien. Then the Blu-ray version feature have the Galactopedia, which expands upon the universe of Galaxy Quest, much like&#x97;and written by the writers of&#x97;the Star Trek Encyclopedia, including backstory for the planets and characters, explanations of the Techno Babble, and references to things that happened during the production of the show. Overall If you are a fan of Sci Fi, go see the movie! If you are a fan of Sci-Fi that can't laugh at yourself, don't go see it. Lt. Chen pretty much sum it up for me, with his quote 'That was a hell of a thing. Indeed, it was.
