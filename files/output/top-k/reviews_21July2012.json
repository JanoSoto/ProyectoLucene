[{"date":"21 July 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" My first taste of avant-garde comedian Andy Kaufman was, while watching old episodes of Saturday Night Live, his Mighty Mouse bit he did for that show. I knew nothing about him at the time, and I still didn't know much about him until seeing this brilliant biopic about his life and career. Jim Carrey plays Kaufman in this Milos Forman directed flick that examines the controversial and confusing career that Kaufman had. It's full of lies, deceit, and publicity stunts that established his career as something of a great big farce. Andy Kaufman was a brilliant mind that very few could understand completely. What he did, he did for himself. He had huge aspirations to be incredibly famous, he just didn't know what to do in order to get there.It's clear that the world of comedy has never seen anything quite like Andy Kaufman. It's hard to adequately explain just what his career was all about. It includes sitcoms, jazz singing, wrestling, and everything else you wouldn't expect it to have. But there was a bizarre brilliance to it all that translates throughout this film wonderfully. Watching the dramatized development of this strange career is as entertaining as it is fascinating. We never get an idea of why Kaufman does all that he does and no explanation is given as to why he is how he is. This somewhat breaks the ideals of what a biopic should be but, then again, nobody fully understood what Andy Kaufman was all about, so does a film really have the right to make that up? The biggest complaint I've seen about this film is that it focuses more on the career of Andy Kaufman rather than his personal life. There is undoubtedly some truth to this, but it's not something that bothered me. His career is what is interesting, and his career was so involved and it completely consumed his life so, in a way, his personal life was his career.Man on the Moon is simply just a great film. It's not a perfect biopic, but a damn good one and it tells an incredibly interesting story about an incredibly interesting man. Jim Carrey absolutely owns his role as Kaufman and gives it his all in portraying the late genius. The film is more entertaining than it is heartfelt and it's more comedic than it is dramatic, but it possesses all of these elements in some degree. It's a bizarrely fun film to watch, uncomfortable at times but always pleasing, much in the same vein as the career of the strangely brilliant Andy Kaufman.

It rather relies on its story, characters and underlying tension, like every good thriller should do, in my opinion.No, this movie doesn't has the most likely story in it and some of the developments aren't all that convincing but the movie is simply being good and enjoyable for what it is. As a thriller it does serve its purpose well and probably won't disappoint anybody that is looking for a good thriller.In its simplicity and setup, this is being a quite effective thriller, in which a cop starts terrorizing a family, when he falls for the wife. Things are slowly starting to get worse and more troublesome for the family. The way the entire movie gets buildup ensures that the tension of the movie works out effectively. It's basically being one of those stalker movies, a lot got made of, during the '80's and '90's. This happens to be one of the lesser known ones but it most certainly is not among the worst ones as well. You could even say that this is being a bit of an underrated and under-appreciated movie.This movie also made me realize what a shame and waste it was that Ray Liotta's career never truly reached great heights. There was a period, around the time of this movie, that he truly was an A-list actor but he never really managed to maintain this status and there are too few classics, starring him, to consider his career to be a truly successful one. There was far more in it really. It's not like he has stopped acting but it's hard to imaging his career is still going to take off now. He was an absolutely great and charismatic presence and villain in this movie and almost completely stole the show away from other fine actors such as Kurt Russell and Madeleine Stowe.This really is being a good, straightforward, old fashioned thriller, that is definitely worth a watch.7\/10 http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"21 July 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Thing I like about this movie is that it isn't overdoing anything, or feels the need to spice things up with gunfights or explosions.

This film isn't exactly a horror movie, it's more of a supernatural suspense thriller.And the film may have been one of the partial inspirations for The X-Files yeah I could see an episode of Mulder and Skully visiting this island.The suspense is of a different kind, it's similar to the films Angel Heart and The Ninth Gate where on the surface it seems like a simple cut and dry hunt to find someone or something. But as you get more deeply engaged in the mystery you have a feel or realize it's about a lot more. It's all a math equation where you know it's all going to add up to something but the question is what. It's suspenseful because we know that the protagonist really should quit at some point because you have a feel if not exact proof that whatever it all adds up to it's not good. But at the same time you can't help but want to see it though to the end because you simply want to know what it all means; it's the common strength and folly of the need to know.I love the sense of isolation which adds to the unsafe feeling. There is just no one you really can trust in this film not just from the unusual nature of the people but that none are whom they seem, most I never found completely likable because it's like their nice but then their not. My favorite suspenseful moment no doubt is the game of chance where everyone has to be in line to stand inside a series of sword blades in the form of a star for an amount of time, if one is left in the circle when time runs out well you can guess what happens next.The visual and production value is great, it was fascinating and really strange at the same time just seeing the Celtic Pagan practices exercised in modern times, it really has the feeling of a world where these practices are the norm. My favorite is no doubt seeing the may day festival and everyone in all those bizarre masks and costumes, it was sort of the pagan version of Marti Graz. I even like the in-depth knowledge on all the pagan symbols and rituals, hearing about it made me want to know more.The music is great as well despite not my style it really fits with the film. And this film has a lot of music moments which almost makes this film a bit of a musical, and one of the ones I personally in my book since I personally am not a fan of the genre only other one I like is Dr.Horrible's Sing A Long Blog but that's a different story. Anyway, I really like the music and songs because of how strange they are as well as their sexuality overtones.The late Edward Woodward as Sergent Howie is good. It's true his character isn't totally likable, he's kinda repressed, pompous, not cool. However he's worthy of some sympathy because he has common sense and clearly out of place in the island. You can emphasize with his disorientation as we see in his eyes certain things that even we don't see everyday. Like seeing sexual acts in the public eye, naked girls in some fertility dance jumping though a bon fire (wonder if anyone ever died in that one), and others I don't want to give away you have to see to believe. You can share a bit in his disdain because certain things people do and say are ethically questionable.But to me the one character that really drives this film for me is Lord Summerisle played by one of my favorite actors Christopher Lee. This to me is probably my favorite role from him because his character is sort of on the gray area because he's not exactly a villain despite what he does at the end he would be. I find his character likable he feels like someone I could be friends with; he has charisma, he's interesting seems to have a lot of hobbies, he loves having fun and life, sociable. However he also has a sinister nature that brews within and when we see it near the end it is both disarming and sends a chill.The interesting thing about the film is seeing the constant conflict in both the Christianity and Pagan faiths. Both Howie and Lord Summerisle I feel are two sides of the same coin, both of them are strongly devoted in what they believe in. But their folly is in their inflexibility from Howie's lack of understanding of the culture as well as his repression which keeps him from being more human. Summerisle isn't completely up to the times and it's ethical boundaries, he believes that the old ways still work but when time moves on it always produces different results.The ending is unforgettable, seeing it turned my blood cold because I knew in that moment there was nothing more anyone could do.If your looking for something different in the suspense thriller genre then give this film a try, I guarantee you you won't get burned.Rating 4 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"21 July 2012","score":"","review":" One of the other things about suspense thrillers that make them suspenseful is the protagonist forced out of his or her comfort zone or element, this it's based on our subconscious fear of an area were not familiar with or even understand will turn against us.

First, it was impossible to understand the interviews with Leon Theremin. The version I watched had no English subtitles, so most of the last third of this film was useless. Also, they interviewed a woman with short, brown hair that spoke Russian with no subtitles. Another problem is that most of these people are not introduced or have their names on the screen. I had no idea who these people were and why they were being interviewed. (My opinion is the director didn't know why these people were being interviewed either.) Anyway, the last third of this film just drags on and on because you don't who the people are, and you can't understand what they're saying. It's so bad, it's really annoying.Another problem is the look and feel of this film. It was made in the early 90's, but has the look and feel of a 70's documentary. It appears that the director had no preconceived plan of what he wanted, so he went out and filmed all this footage and then tried to make a story out of it when he got back to the editing suite. I've worked on documentaries, and that's NOT how you should do it. The director had 15-20 years to improve upon the look of his film, but did not. This leads me to think that he was very inexperienced. The film looks very amateurish and dated. Is it all bad? No. The first 2\/3 are fairly interesting and tell a good (if disjointed) story of Theremin and his inventions. I loved the performances by Clara Rockmore. They were moving and beautiful. All the archive footage was pretty cool. And Brain Wilson's interview is something you just have to experience for yourself - it's classic! I also enjoyed the interviews with Robert Moog - very enlightening. All in all, this is a decent film (God, I hate it when they say A Film by ______ in the credits. It sounds so pompous!) But, it suffers from a lack of direction which makes the last third so bad, it's painful. Plus, we can't understand what happened after Theremin was kidnapped and brought back to Russia.

It's really frustrating. ","genre":"Documentary, Biography, History"},{"date":"21 July 2012","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I get it. I really do.

A lot of people dogged Dreamworks during and 90's and still due because they're trying to compete with Disney. First of all they don't have to compete, because Dreamworks is definitely in the same league and this movie proves it. The music of the movie is amazing and it's what I love best about it. Deliver Us is such a dramatic and poised piece of music, just hearing it play as you watch the Hebrew slaves struggle, and then there is Yocheved (I think that's her name) when she sings River Oh River. I love Ofra Haza as Yocheved, her voice is so beautiful and natural. Next song I love is what people seem to recognize the most is When You Believe, it is a divine hymn of faith saying that even if all goes wrong, if you remain faithful, God will show mercy. The movie version which is sung by Miriam (Sally Dworsky) and Tzipporah (Michelle Pfeiffer) is pretty good, I especially like the break in the middle where the children sing Ashi Ra; but to be honest I liked the cover sung by Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston more. Maybe it's because of my African American roots that prefer the gospel version instead. With that being said, the movie is full of beautiful scores but these are my favorites. The art and animation in this movie is absolutely top notch. I think it's the only film to do what it's done during time it was created. What makes Prince of Egypt so unique is that it blended traditional drawing and painting with digital CGI. Keep in mind that this was during the 90's so digital animation was still in experimentation, and what's surprising is how good the animation looks. It doesn't look like a blocky, pixelated mess that you would find during this era,everything looks so smooth,vivid and rich.A few notable things to point out are The Burning Bush, The Red Sea,The Plagues,the Angel of Death and the parting of the Red Sea.These are the BEST scenes in the entire movie, all digital! Last but not least , the story! Last year I watched an episode of Nostalgia Critic's Old vs. New where he decided which of the two movies, The Ten Commandments and Th e Prince of Egypt,was better. He ultimately chose The Prince of Egypt, and the thing that gave P.O.E. it's edge is the amazing storyline. The decision of the writers to make Moses and Ramses brothers instead of sworn enemies was a great move. It gives way more drama and emotion to the story because Moses goes through a constant internal struggle, whether or not to go against the brother he loves, to stay truthful to his god and his people or to continue living the life of comfort with the only family he's known and deny what he truly is. All in all this is a superb animated film for people of all ages, truly something of a masterpiece and I feel that everybody should at least watch this once if not hundreds of times (it's that good).

Spacey is now a man because he's thrown in his job, blackmailed his boss and lusts after a school girl, as well as treating his family like dirt. Benning... well, she was just a complete embarrassment. I mean, seriously! How can anyone watch her and not cringe??

I had seen bits and pieces of the movie before, but I never really became engaged in it, possibly because of it's supposedly obvious plot. However, the pieces of the story that freaked out a number of my friends were nothing they could have guessed. Case in point Zelda, Gage, and Pascow. Wow. This freaked them out entirely, to the point of one of my friends admitting that Zelda screwed up his childhood dreams for many years when he was taken to the film as a child.The music was not your typical brooding, synthesizer-pad, horror movie score all the way either, with The Ramones writing a punk rock song for the film and having another of their hits jamming in the truck-driver's cab. The cat they got to play as Church (the family cat) was an amazing animal-actor (I guess you could say), and the effect they used on the eyes was really cool.The plot is almost half-given away by the cover art and title, so I'm trying to leave out as much as possible, but it seems that the story was more about past guilt and trying to make amends with your guilty conscience by bringing things back, to save them and your guilt. It's an excellent thought, but as Fred Gwynne puts it, Sometimes dead is better.Go rent it the next time you feel like a horror movie and see a nice twist on the zombie\/ghost genre. It's a classic.

And if there's one thing I dislike it's a bunch of undisciplined, trick-or-treat kids who feel the world loves them to run riot and snap their fingers in the faces of authority. But when my local DVD store offered the Single Disc Special Edition for a mere $6.50, how could I pass it up? Yes, the movie was almost as bad in its storyline and characterizations -- even worse in fact, as the mother is presented as an even worse bimbo than her kids with not even half a brain in her skull -- but the little creature himself is anything but your usual cutesy-cutesy, and that in itself makes a very agreeable change. The movie's other main asset is John Williams who makes a sterling effort to save the day when the movie finally runs out of puff, plot and credibility!
