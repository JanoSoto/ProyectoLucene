There is a lot of passion for music coming through in this movie, and its felt by the audience.

I was on holiday before hand, and although I enjoyed it, my mind was really on going home, and seeing The Phantom Menace. The cinema was pretty packed, and I think we managed to avoid all the trailers, so we were just sitting down when the Fox fanfare started. I was sitting next to my sister, who's a big Star Wars fan too, and we were almost pinching each other when the words Episode I The Phantom Menace appeared on the screen. I quickly got into my film analysing mood, and just sat back at watched it. Although the opening battle with Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon was all terribly exciting, I found myself thinking, Come on, get to the plot!. When Jar Jar arrived on the screen, instead of sighing deeply like the rest of the audience, I actually found him quite funny (he does make me laugh occasionally even now), especially the scenes inside the Bongo. And although I was enjoying it, and on the edge of my seat during most of it, I found myself thinking that when Obi-Wan is hanging onto the edge of the pit during the lightsaber duel, I didn't care particularly if he got his lightsaber or not. I know that sounds like a dreadful thing to say, but if it wasn't for the fact that I liked Obi-Wan in the Classic Trilogy, and liked Ewan McGregor, I wouldn't have cared about the character at all. And I didn't mind Anakin. I thought he's youthfullness fit in exactly with how Luke Skywalker acts in the Classic Trilogy, so he had all the Skywalker traits, although I would have liked it if some of his darker side was shown during the film. Infact, I got a bit fed up with the whole, He gives without any thought of reward, thingy...it seemed a bit...well, unrealistic...which is a dodgy word to say when you're dealing with Star Wars. Also, I felt a distinct lack of empathy towards Amidaala. She seemed a bit arrogant, frankly. I think her impassive tones got on my nerves after awhile, partly because it sounded like a very rubbish attempt to do a posh English accent. When Padme appeared, I did connect with her more, but she still carried that slightly arrogant streak from before. Qui-Gon's slight sense of detachment was good, too, but after watching it later, it seemed as if Liam Neeson was bored. I thought the whole Darth Sidious\/Palpatine was terribly clever, and his honesty towards Amidaala was almost believable...almost. Infact my Dad, who doesn't know much about Star Wars, did manage to work out that Palpatine was up to something, but he didn't realise that Palpatine was Darth Sidious. My Mum, who isn't a big fan of science fiction (she's more into the Psycho\/The Mosquito Coast\/Chicken Run style of film), but I think she got quickly absorbed into the plot. In fact, she even shed a little tear when Anakin left his mother. My sister didn't like Jar Jar at all, but she found the Nemodians' accent terribly funny, for some reason (well, I did, too).One thing which I felt was missing from The Phantom Menace, was the dry wit of the Classic Trilogy. I actually bought the screenplay before hand, and I skimmed through it, and notice that Obi-Wan had a really cool line in the opening sequence, which was something like, Off hand, I'd say this mission is part the negoations stage, which is a pretty cool thing to say in the middle of a fight, but sadly....it wasn't there. Why George didn't keep that line in, I have no idea. Another thing which really didn't gel with me was the Gungan\/Battle droid fight sequence. Now, I'm all for slapstick (I love Tom and Jerry, and Harpo Marx, and they're pretty much built on slapstick humour), but the whole thing of Jar Jar acting like an idiot, while everyone around him was getting killed I really didn't like. Maybe it's because as I grow up with Doctor Who, I have a strong anti-war feeling, and the whole idea of playing a battle sequence for laughs is just disgusting. Sure, it's great to have a silly bit in a battle sequence, like in Return of the Jedi, but when it's all silly, it get's a bit sickening. Also, I felt the whole space battle sequence was over far too quickly. In the Classic Trilogy, the battle sequence play an important part in all three films. Sure, I wasn't expecting something on the level of excitment as the Battle of Yavin, or the Battle of Endor, but something along the lines of the Asterdroid field chase in Empire Strikes Back would have been great. Instead, it's only given a few moments of screen-time, and is over all pretty quickly. The opening bit on Naboo was so boring, too. The camera moves so slowly from Panaka to Amidaala, then to Bibble, it looks as if someone who knew nothing about film directed the thing. The lightsaber battle was something that I really enjoyed, but the lack of a conversation between Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon, and Darth Maul was something that I didn't like, either. Now, when I say conversation, I don't mean discussing the weather, I mean sinister stuff. In fact, I was pretty disapointed that Darth Maul only spoke about two times. Not really fair, is it? I also felt the Tatooine stuff went on for far too long. We've seen Tatooine before, and now it's not an alien environment. It's not interesting. It just seems like being in your mate's back gardern. Not really exciting, if you see what I mean.What I did like was the senate stuff. The funny thing about The Phantom Menace is that there are some bits which are totally uninteresting, flat scenes, and other bits where you can tell that George has woken up, or is getting used to directing again. The senate scene is just like this. So are all the bits with the Jedi, and Darth Sidious. Also, many people said that what The Phantom Menace needed was a cool, Han Solo character. Well, we've got him, and it's Qui-Gon. If Han had become a Jedi, he'd probably end up being like Han Solo. Also, although I'm a basher, I actually liked the whole midichlorian thing. I thought a scientific explanation for the Force was quite cool, and fitting into the idea that the Republic was more advanced than the Empire.One problem was that after seeing the film, my family did the usual thing of discussing the plot, and we happened to be standing next to the poster for Episode I, with Anakin casting the shadow of Darth Vader.

All in all not something I would recommend you to watch but neither something you must beware of. Oh yes Anna Kournikova is in this one too and she looks very good (better than on court). Too bad there is not more of her in the film.6 out of 10 ","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"25 February 2001","score":"","review":"  MI2 has excellent action sequences.

The Alien saga does not fit in this category although I have yet to see Alien 3 and I have seen the 4th but not all of it and I thought that was okay. Aliens is one of the best sequels I have ever seen. It may be longer than the first ( my version is the Special Edition which lasts 148 minutes ) but it is just as good if not better. Ripley wakes up after 57 years of hypersleep and finds that the planet where she found the alien has now been colonised. But they have lost contact with the colonists and Ripley goes along with a bunch of marines to see what has happened. All they find is a little girl and a whole load of Aliens! While the first had only one alien and was rarely seen in full, this one is an alien overload! No matter how many bullets are used, they just keep on coming. And later, we are introduced to the Alien Queen who has a fight with a power-suited Ripley at the climax. This film is now 15 years old but like the first it has not dated. The Alien effects are so cool especially the Queen. Just goes to show that you don't always need CGI effects! Although this is more of an action film, there is quite a bit of gore and there are also some tense moments.

Having immensely enjoyed recent renderings of Sense and Sensibility, Emma, and various versions of Pride and Prejudice, I expected to receive similar enjoyment from this film.  I had not read any reviews or advance press before watching it.  I had, unfortunately, just read the book itself this summer and it was fresh in my mind.  In my opinion this is the WORST rendition of a Jane Austen work I have ever seen.  Perhaps if I had never read the book, I might have enjoyed it somewhat more, but to me it was unbearable to see a book I thoroughly enjoyed so completely rewritten.  I am astonished at the comments of some of the reviewers here opining that Jane Austen would have approved. Poppycock!I began to feel sick early on.  To me, the character of Fanny Price and other major characters bore as much resemblance to Jane Austen's heroine as Danny Devito bore to Arnold Schwarzenegger in Twins. The entire invention of Fanny as a budding writer, the deletion of her younger brother who was so important in the plot concerning Henry Crawford, the image of Fanny as somewhat outspoken and rebellious, the depiction of Fanny's aunt as an opium addict and her uncle as a brutish, raping slaveowner.... The list goes on and on.  Henry and Maria being caught by Fanny in the house, Fanny voluntarily kissing Henry and agreeing to marry him and then retracting.  Ugh!I really detest writers who want to mold everything in the modern vein. Fanny Price was not a modern heroine, but she fit her time.  There was far too much PC propaganda and feminist hogwash which you might expect in a movie about our society but is ridiculous set against Fanny's time. She was devout, loyal, quiet, humble, stubborn only in her keen perception of others' character as measured against her conviction of what was good and what was not, possessing an innate strength of character which did not rely on others' perception of her and which she refused to compromise.  Jane Austen would not have approved of this new Fanny for precisely this reason  her Fanny did not care about the new conventions of moral thought and permissiveness in her own society.  The movie downplayed the seriously flawed characters of Henry Crawford and his sister.  It portrayed him far too sympathetically, made it appear that he truly and deeply loved Fanny and seemed to blame Fanny's (non-existent) double-mindedness for his downfall.All in all, this is an extremely disappointing film if one cares about what was really written in Mansfield Park.  I think Clueless as a modern version of Emma (and which I also enjoyed) is more true to Austen than this let-down of a movie.

But truly he's hardly the most responsible party. I could blame L.Ron Hubbard for writing an insipid book. Or John Travolta's ego for making the insipid book into the insipid movie now available. I could blame Giles Nuttgens for some truly ugly cinematography. Or the entirely special effects crew could be blamed for seemingly spending 75 million dollars to create cheesy afterburner effects on cardboard looking space crafts. But ultimately there's just too much blame to go around. All that can be said is that Battlefield Earth is possibly even worse than you may have heard. And that's impressive.The plot is a mishmash of science fiction clichés, the kind of things a Phillip K. Dick or Robert Heinlein would be embarrassed to even think, much less write. Battlefield Earth takes place a thousand years in the future. Now, we're told on at least two occasions, Man is an Endangered Creature. The planet Earth is ruled by tall, ugly aliens called Psychlos. The Psychlos don't really like the Man-Animals and, for no good reason, keep them locked in cages. But it isn't as if Man is doing so well even without the Psychlos. We're living in caves again and nobody has developed proper grooming standards. That's the premise. There isn't really a plot beyond the fact that Johnny Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper) wants to lead a rebellion and Terl (Travolta), the Psychlo Security guru, wants to stop him. Things blow up, people say stupid things, and there's a stupid subplot involving Ker, another Psychlo played by Forrest Whitaker, who must have desperately needed this paycheck.There isn't a single piece of the alien technology that looks cool, or even interesting. That's a flaw for a science fiction film. Similarly, none of the images of destroyed humanity (like the shell of the Denver Public Library, or an old mini-golf course) are the least bit evocative. That's a flaw for a post-apocalyptic drama. And none of the action scenes achieve any kind of pacing or momentum. And that's a problem for any film.For some strange reason virtually every shot in the film is at a jarring angle. If Christian's point is that this is a world askew, he probably could have made it was one slightly tilted camera angle. Instead, the artistic pretension just seems silly. Ditto the lengths Christian has to go to to make us believe that the Psychlos are really tall. He'd have been better off using actors in stilts rather than the low angle shots and other tricks he uses. Also, is there any reason why the film keeps going back to slow motion over and over? Slow motion, even used in moderation, is kinda tacky, but it just pulls me out of an action sequence when you add that level of contrievance.While Barry Pepper's performance is just awful, I have no way of telling what the blazes John Travolta is doing. He speaks with a strange stilted accent (British, not Psychlo), his hand gestures are wooden, befitting the silly suit he's wearing, and it all just smells like a bad Saturday Night Live skit performance. Remember the skit where he played a potentially gay vampire? Imagine that gay vampire in an alien suit in a really horrible movie and that's what you have here. My point is that Travolta is funny. Sometimes the humor is intentional (the scene where the Psychlo discover the Man-Animals' food of choice is a hoot), but why does he keep using the word leverage? I kept waiting for Inigo Montoya to arrive from the Princess Bride saying, I do not think that world means what you think it means. It's all just a mess.I watched the movie with a friend who has extensive experience with film editing and he insists that Battlefield Earth was fairly well edited because it looked like the cutting covered up a lot of even worse work.

I'm now writing my dissertation on Kennedy as part of my history degree and there was an irony in seeing the film again - the film that had got me interested in the first place - because I couldn't help finding fault with some of its conclusions.JFK argues that Kennedy was killed because he had wanted to pull America out of Vietnam and ease relations with the Soviet Union, something that the military-industrial complex simply wouldn't allow.  It was this idea that I had problems with because it was Kennedy who had sent over 15,000 American troops to Vietnam, and who may have provoked the Cuban Missile Crisis because of overt and covert moves against Castro.  I was worried that this would ruin the movie, but historians argue so endlessly and I've changed my own mind so often that I just ignored the would-be niggles.  Besides, if the facts don't necessarily support this idea of Kennedy now, it was undoubtedly the perception at the time so may well have been the motive behind the assassination.There are further problems that pedantic historians have complained about; a number of composite or fictional characters, genuine testimony transplanted to fictional locations, and the use of both real and recreated archive footage combine to undermine its credibility.  These, too, can be forgiven because JFK has a responsibility not just to provide facts, but to provide a coherent narrative, and it would have been impossible to have uncovered every word that was spoken during the Garrison investigation or kept them in their original context.  A degree of manipulation and invention was necessary.  Without these compromises, JFK would have lost much of its atmosphere and been a far weaker film, so I was happy to let them pass.Even with these criticisms, JFK remains a masterpiece, by far the best film from occasional genius Oliver Stone.  I can't think of any movie that has the same sense of urgency, of outrage and passion, and such determination to convince.  Adapted from two books, the screenplay is perfect and is testament to Stone's skill that he could take the masses of evidence and turn it into a coherent script, with co-writer Zachary Sklar.  Following District Attorney Jim Garrison, the only man to ever bring a suspect to trial in the murder of the President, the film is utterly convincing in its criticisms of the Warren Commission Report and in its presentation of the conspiracy behind the assassination.It boasts perhaps the greatest ever ensemble cast, including Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, Walter Matthau, Sissy Spacek, Laurie Metcalf, Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, Gary Oldman, Brian Doyle-Murray, Wayne Knight, John Candy, Donald Sutherland, Bob Gunton and Jim Garrison himself.  The last name, in the role of Earl Warren, should prove that, contrary to popular belief, Stone has a fine understanding of irony.  The weakest link in the stunning cast is Costner, but he gives his best performance in the lead role and manages to avoid his wooden delivery for most of the mammoth running time.  Even when he stumbles, he carries the movie perfectly.His performance is certainly enough to make the final forty-five minute courtroom scene the greatest and most electrifying I've ever seen.  We are bombarded with evidence of the conspiracy, of the Warren Commission cover-up, of the convenient deaths of witnesses and critics, and are shown the notorious `magic bullet' theory and the terrible footage taken by Abraham Zapruder.Within his air of excitement at revealing the conspiracy and his determination to find his truth, Stone never forgets the truth that everyone can agree on; that Kennedy was not just a President, but a man, who was murdered as his wife sat next to him.  Whether you believe the Kennedy legacy or not, it is a hard heart that doesn't break to see the final bullet strike him, to see his wife reach out across the boot of the car to rescue the debris, and to see his young son salute his father's coffin as it passes.  The respectful tone that is taken throughout is perfect.Historians should be grateful to Oliver Stone for bringing history to a wider audience, one that a documentary simply would not have reached.  Its flaws are necessary to this end, and when Stone himself talks of his film in terms of a counter-myth, you realise he was not merely in search of the truth, but in search of other people who seek the same; this should be the only starting point.

Without these compromises, JFK would have lost much of its atmosphere and been a far weaker film, so I was happy to let them pass.Even with these criticisms, JFK remains a masterpiece, by far the best film from occasional genius Oliver Stone.  I can't think of any movie that has the same sense of urgency, of outrage and passion, and such determination to convince.  Adapted from two books, the screenplay is perfect and is testament to Stone's skill that he could take the masses of evidence and turn it into a coherent script, with co-writer Zachary Sklar.  Following District Attorney Jim Garrison, the only man to ever bring a suspect to trial in the murder of the President, the film is utterly convincing in its criticisms of the Warren Commission Report and in its presentation of the conspiracy behind the assassination.It boasts perhaps the greatest ever ensemble cast, including Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, Walter Matthau, Sissy Spacek, Laurie Metcalf, Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, Gary Oldman, Brian Doyle-Murray, Wayne Knight, John Candy, Donald Sutherland, Bob Gunton and Jim Garrison himself.  The last name, in the role of Earl Warren, should prove that, contrary to popular belief, Stone has a fine understanding of irony.  The weakest link in the stunning cast is Costner, but he gives his best performance in the lead role and manages to avoid his wooden delivery for most of the mammoth running time.  Even when he stumbles, he carries the movie perfectly.His performance is certainly enough to make the final forty-five minute courtroom scene the greatest and most electrifying I've ever seen.  We are bombarded with evidence of the conspiracy, of the Warren Commission cover-up, of the convenient deaths of witnesses and critics, and are shown the notorious `magic bullet' theory and the terrible footage taken by Abraham Zapruder.Within his air of excitement at revealing the conspiracy and his determination to find his truth, Stone never forgets the truth that everyone can agree on; that Kennedy was not just a President, but a man, who was murdered as his wife sat next to him.  Whether you believe the Kennedy legacy or not, it is a hard heart that doesn't break to see the final bullet strike him, to see his wife reach out across the boot of the car to rescue the debris, and to see his young son salute his father's coffin as it passes.  The respectful tone that is taken throughout is perfect.Historians should be grateful to Oliver Stone for bringing history to a wider audience, one that a documentary simply would not have reached.  Its flaws are necessary to this end, and when Stone himself talks of his film in terms of a counter-myth, you realise he was not merely in search of the truth, but in search of other people who seek the same; this should be the only starting point.  JFK is a film that should make you angry and make you ask more.  For me, at least, it did both.

I've never seen a film by the Coen brothers I didn't like; a few of their films rank among my all-time favs. So my expectations were sky-high and even so I came out thrilled, surprised, and more than satisfied. This story is a wonderful homage to the Homeric epic, but crafted so nicely that even one who has no knowledge of the Odyssey will still love the film! (One or two scenes might be slightly confusing...the Baptism scene and the Sirens for example, but not enough to ruin the film for anyone). The cinematography was *wow* good! Gorgeous scenes, gorgeous sets, just plain gorgeous. And the film was marvelously acted, Clooney was a stand-out, his best performance ever (even topping the Peacemaker, and he was brilliant in that!). And Coen regulars John Turturro and John Goodman were fabulous as always! Allusions were everywhere, not just to Homer, but to Robert Johnson and Babyface (the bank robber, not the producer;), among others. The script was masterful, a perfect combination of epic flavour and modern story. This film is a keeper! Hilarious, well-written, well-crafted, beautifully shot...it proves that you don't need a 100 million dollar budget for special effects to make a quality film. This is right alongside Traffic and Crouching Tiger as the best films of the year! The only reason I don't give it a perfect ten is that it runs just a little long. An easy 9\/10.
