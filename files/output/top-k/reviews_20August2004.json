Some say this movie is trash and vile, disgusting nonsense, but most will agree this is a seminal film that was part of the 1970's horror film revolution. This film took me into another world when I first saw it. I was a horror fanatic who had seen many more contemporary horror films before I saw this for the first time. When I saw it in its totality, I was in awe&#133;it held me to the edge of my seat. The chase through the woods by Leatherface is one of my cinematic memories for keeping me wide eyed and fixated solely on the screen&#133;I actually got tense&#133;and I don't get tense. This a raw film-making brilliance, Tobe Hopers seminal horror work that was a part of the 1970's horror revolution that was being waged by horror greats George Romero, David Cronenberg, Wes Craven (somewhat), and John Carpenter.I saw another post that said this film has no meaning or message, it's tasteless was the sum of their review, I however disagree with all my heart.This is a movie that puts a mirror to the post-Vietnam era and challenges the status of our society in terms of its social and family values. This is a twisted and cannibalistic family that is led into madness because of the loss of the American values as a result of the technological revolution. They used to run the slaughter house and now they have been replaced by machines. In their loss of fulfillment they turn to murder and cannibalism in order to fill their void; this is obviously an allegorical statement by Hooper regarding the loss of jobs and substance at this particular point in American history. It also is a film that stresses the deconstruction of the family. This films theme seems to resonate in similar form to a Sam Peckinpah film, that being the loss of the great frontier and American spirit. This is a family that has gone insane because of a loss of tradition. The youths disposed of in this film represent those victims that are caught in the after blast of this condition. If Peckinpah were to do a horror, this might have been it.This is not a true story by the way, this was just one of the many films to lie about a non-fiction incident. It is, however, one of the many films to be influenced by the legendary serial killer Ed Gein. A killer who took the skin off his victims and made wigs from them, he also made furniture, art and jewelry with their body parts. Gein was also the influence for Psycho.

Just proves that certain movies get better if you give them the chance, and THE EXORCIST III is one of the best examples I can think of where a feature needs to be studied more than once to be fully appreciated.It was written and directed by William Peter Blatty, author of the original THE EXORCIST. Blatty was never quite pleased with certain aspects of William Friedkin's film version of his book, and even despised EXORCIST II - THE HERETIC (don't we all?) so he managed to satisfy himself (and perhaps those of us who loathed PART II right along with him) by fashioning a compelling and understated horror tale that actually functions better as a detective story and a proper followup to the original horror classic.Part III features George C. Scott taking over the role of Lt. Kinderman from the late Lee J. Cobb. On the 15th Anniversary of the death of Father Karras, Scott starts becoming aware of a string of brutal murders that seem to match the M.O. of a serial killer that was executed on the same fateful night that Karras took his deadly plunge down the stairway at the end of the first film. It turns out that Karras is still alive in a sanitarium, but possessed by the soul of the serial killer (played by Brad Dourif, who comes off partly effective, partly rambling). Working through the broken body of Father Karras in his cell, the killer is continuing his old murders by channeling his will through elderly catatonic patients in the hospital.One of the personal thrills for me was to see Jason Miller reprise his role as Father Karras, this time a helpless victim of the serial killer with an occasional moment or two of clarity within his own self. George C. Scott delivers a fabulous performance and was a perfect choice to continue the role of Kinderman from THE EXORCIST. Of course the movie has its flaws, the worst being the inclusion of an exorcism which Blatty never wanted to film but which the studio insisted on when they called the feature EXORCIST III (Blatty's unrealized title was to have been LEGION, based on his novel of the same name). There occasionally seems to be bits of unrelated business belonging to some other film here and there, due to post-production tampering. If not for these unfortunate kinks, EXORCIST III night have emerged as an excellent film instead of a good one.As of this writing there is strong talk of a Director's Cut DVD in the works, offering up Blatty's intended version of the movie. This can only make the film even better.

When in a majority of flicks the actors that age are in the early or mid twenties and look way too old. it's what a real high school looks like, and Clarence (Sean Astin-Samwise, Lord of the Rings Trilogy) his wacky, sarcastic friend, was in this when he was fifteen or sixteen, making him look actually a little young to be a senior. He is the one responsible for the body change, snatching an ancient potion from his archaeologist uncle. Chris' dad, Jack (Dudley Moore) is a heart surgeon, on the verge of being named chief of staff. And Chris is on his biology exam not seeming to have much of a clue what he's talking about, and is an average student. But then they switch bodies and Chris is in his dad's body and his dad has to go to school cause he's in Chris' body, and is really studious in his classes, even smarter than the teachers! While Chris in his dad's body doesn't have the slightest clue what he's doing as a heart surgeon, and has no sophisticated vocabulary, and parties like a child\/teenager. Chris has bully problems at school and has to face up to a huge old looking kid who says dickhead And the kids at school think Chris is a dork, as his father, but the interns at the hospital think he's a lot of fun, chewing gum, driving a jeep, and taking them out for pizza and beer. The chief-of-staff's wife, a good 25-years younger than him, cheats on her husband and screws around with Jack' in Chris body, which leads to catastrophe. Anyway, I really like this movie. Here are some reasons why, and also why, I think it was superior to the others and should of gotten three stars, if not more. Despite the acting and script being considered inferior, this is the only one that makes me truly happy when watching it, it is set in southern California where the sun is always shining during the day. Sean Astin was in this at a young age, the kid is a teenager, and not a child, so there's two girlfriends in the movie. it is priceless watching Dudley Moore party and laugh watching MTV, and dance on the kitchen table to rock and roll.

Cars and girls and burgers...but not your standard 80s cheap flick.This oozes quality from the opening shot. The cast were almost all in their first film...check the cast list...unreal. Barry Levinson's first film too...it's a little piece of film history and probably to this day most of these actors look back on it as their proudest moment.Great making of pieces out there about this flick too...must sees with Kevin Bacon et al discussing their experience...terrific storybook stuff.Can't speak highly enough of this...but I will say I think guys will enjoy it more than girls...and even then, it's only for film fans...not for the blockbuster guzzler or the action Jacksons among us. If you read, or love classic film this really, really is a must own, let alone must see. This is film art but can equally be viewed over a TV dinner.Lodged someplace between Woody Allen and Made.Spread the word -)  ","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"20 August 2004","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  The first time I watched The Gate I was 7 or 8, and I remember that this movie scared the shht out of me.

I thought the movie itself was excellent, and yet the ending seemed to wrap up so quickly, it just didn't seem fitting.It wasn't so much the concept that I enjoyed, as I usually don't care for movies involving time travel. There were other elements that made this so great, such as the acting (particularly Gyllenhaal). The dialogue was amazing. I really think this could be overlooked as a result of the confusing concept and the creepy plot, but little things in the conversations were so refreshing to see in a movie. For this alone I could watch the movie over and over (not that I plan to). I also enjoyed the political and social commentary woven into the dialogue and the story. It was a huge part of the film, yet in so many different ways. Its thrown at you immediately that the story takes place during a presidential election year ('88). Debates within Donnie's family, conversations among school officials, and TV news reports constantly remind you of this. On a more subtle level, the entire power structure within the school is used to take multiple stabs at politics and society. There are plenty of specific examples, but its better to decide for yourself what it could represent.The best thing about the movie to me is everything going on while Donnie figures out the Frank\/time travel mystery...his interactions with his peers, family, and authority. As I said, the time travel\/cause and effect thing didn't really grab me. Its been done before, and will be done again. The ending seemed really rushed and it bothered me. Other than that, the story of Donnie and the hypocritical world he lives in is truly entertaining and thought provoking in many ways.

A Walk in the Clouds does. The story is sweet, romantic, dramatic, and heartwarming. The 1940's was an era when it was terrible shame to be unwed and pregnant. Daughters were often cast away or sent to some distant relative to bear their child in loneliness and disapproval, then the child was given for adoption. I know because I was one of those children. For my mother there was no Paul Sutton to love her and rescue her and her child. The father, portrayed by Giancarlo Gianni was a typical man of those desperate war torn years who was unable to get in touch with his feelings on any level except work and anger. I am more amazed at his ability to show affection for his wife than I am at the anger which rules his life. The family who eventually adopted me was just like this family. Hard horrible father, heavy drinker, full of anger, yet rapier wit and tongue. The rest of the family are so real because in those days most families who had a disagreeable father figure pulled together to make up for and cover over the hurts and embarrassment generated by that father. Very different from today's dysfunctional families. Anthony Quinn was superb and Keanu Reeves could not have been more believable as a simple man with a good heart and high values. His character is not meant to display anything but goodness, which he does beautifully. We have to remember that men used to be governed more by what was right than by the emotion of the moment as they are today. Aitana as Victoria is very lovely and desirable, but her character is also governed by the morals of the day. While she is sexy and flirtatious and clearly loves Paul, she stops short of using his attraction to her to seduce him because the very things she values and loves about him are his stability and uprightness. Today most women would simply go for it, but this film is not about today. It is about real love and true respect. The musical score is simply beautiful and very moving. The wine country and the shot of the California coast along Big Sur are great. Oh, by the by, for the unbelieving, after the grape harvest in the fall the branches of the vine die and become dry and brittle very quickly. The only part of a grape vine that continues to live is the stock and it's root, but even that seems all gray and dead from just looking at the outside. A fire in a dry, post-harvest vineyard would spread and destroy all, just as it did in the film. Today, there are sprinkler systems, etc. to prevent such loss, but not in the 1940's.

The father, portrayed by Giancarlo Gianni was a typical man of those desperate war torn years who was unable to get in touch with his feelings on any level except work and anger. I am more amazed at his ability to show affection for his wife than I am at the anger which rules his life. The family who eventually adopted me was just like this family. Hard horrible father, heavy drinker, full of anger, yet rapier wit and tongue. The rest of the family are so real because in those days most families who had a disagreeable father figure pulled together to make up for and cover over the hurts and embarrassment generated by that father. Very different from today's dysfunctional families. Anthony Quinn was superb and Keanu Reeves could not have been more believable as a simple man with a good heart and high values. His character is not meant to display anything but goodness, which he does beautifully. We have to remember that men used to be governed more by what was right than by the emotion of the moment as they are today. Aitana as Victoria is very lovely and desirable, but her character is also governed by the morals of the day. While she is sexy and flirtatious and clearly loves Paul, she stops short of using his attraction to her to seduce him because the very things she values and loves about him are his stability and uprightness. Today most women would simply go for it, but this film is not about today. It is about real love and true respect. The musical score is simply beautiful and very moving. The wine country and the shot of the California coast along Big Sur are great. Oh, by the by, for the unbelieving, after the grape harvest in the fall the branches of the vine die and become dry and brittle very quickly. The only part of a grape vine that continues to live is the stock and it's root, but even that seems all gray and dead from just looking at the outside. A fire in a dry, post-harvest vineyard would spread and destroy all, just as it did in the film. Today, there are sprinkler systems, etc. to prevent such loss, but not in the 1940's. What a great movie. I own it and will always enjoy watching it again and again.

That confluence of Freudian psychiatry and religion must have rankled people in the 1950s', who were trying to replace religious concepts with the teachings of Freud. But the movie went further than that. Morbius actually went through the process of repentance. At first, self-denial (I'm not a monster). Then realization of guilt (Yes, I must be guilty). Then confession (My evil self is at that door, and I have no power to stop it). Finally, giving up the sin and the self-created monster (Stop, Don't come any further. I deny you.

The attempt to transcend the limitations of mortality must have impressed on the Krell the need to reach beyond the merely human or finite and to somehow experience the infinite, through true creation.

It's a fantasy which makes it your broccoli and spinach salad with cod liver oil dressing. So, please move on and let the rest of us enjoy it.This is not to say the movie is without flaws. It's got them. K&L has been out for a couple of years now and people still complain about Leopold's suit and plot holes and the supposed incest. Interestingly, when I first read a very early blurb about the movie it said that Leopold was from 200 years in the past, which would have put him in about the Regency era. The 200 years would have also pushed the 'incest' concern back another three or four generations. It would also have explained his Regency style getup. The folks who were doing the counting on this incest thing would have to have at least admitted that at 6 or 7 generations removed, Kate and Start would have only shared something like 1\/138th blood. That's a bit less than the 1\/4 it would be for second cousins marrying, etc. If you keep it at 100 or so years separation, it would still be around 1\/16th shared blood. But even that kind of thinking means we're getting away from 'it's a fantasy, folks!'I have a few personal gripes about the movie. When it was out at the theater I saw it twice. Not a usual occurrence for me, even with Hugh Jackman's hunky persona. Frankly, during the first viewing, I could not get past Meg Ryan's hair. I was literally stunned by it. She's such a pretty woman, it amazes me that she thinks (or thought) that the Cookie the Clown haircut was cute. Not! Ms. Ryan, what were you thinking? Was this a mid-life crisis reaction?I've gotten used to Ms. Ryan's hair now and just don't see it anymore. But her performance, seemed to be Meg Ryan phoning is as Meg Ryan. Hugh Jackman was utterly charming as Leopold and so was the young actor who played Kate's brother. Some of their scenes together are the best in the movie.I though the use of profanity was overdone. My reaction is not out of prudishness (I can use the f-word and a heap of others when my car has a flat or won't start or I'm stuck in traffic, etc.) But it seems to me to lessen the authenticity of a character's intelligence. (Think about that the next time you overhear someone swearing continually in line at the grocery store.) It surprised me that Leopold didn't object to Kate's constant swearing (she was, after all, a lady) or that he didn't make a comment on it in general. I didn't feel he was reacting within the social attitudes of his own time. Even if it is a fantasy, he's not going to acclimate to our times all *that* quickly.I read a lot of sci-fi and fantasy, so had no problem with the supposed 'incest' line. It's fantasy. And it's a paradox to begin with. During the time frame Stuart and Kate are in, Kate is NOT his several times removed great-grandmother. Think about *that* end of it.  So, shared blood aside, I can't say I'm sure who it was who was getting their knickers in a twist over that. That all said, it is a charming movie that could have been a blockbuster hit the likes of Sleepless but is not. I'm not sure where the fault lies in that. The Cookie the Clown haircut? Direction? The last minute\/panic edit? Certainly in some of the writing. At this date none of that is going to change, so simply enjoy the movie for itself.

(Think about that the next time you overhear someone swearing continually in line at the grocery store.) It surprised me that Leopold didn't object to Kate's constant swearing (she was, after all, a lady) or that he didn't make a comment on it in general. I didn't feel he was reacting within the social attitudes of his own time. Even if it is a fantasy, he's not going to acclimate to our times all *that* quickly.I read a lot of sci-fi and fantasy, so had no problem with the supposed 'incest' line. It's fantasy. And it's a paradox to begin with. During the time frame Stuart and Kate are in, Kate is NOT his several times removed great-grandmother. Think about *that* end of it.  So, shared blood aside, I can't say I'm sure who it was who was getting their knickers in a twist over that. That all said, it is a charming movie that could have been a blockbuster hit the likes of Sleepless but is not. I'm not sure where the fault lies in that. The Cookie the Clown haircut? Direction? The last minute\/panic edit? Certainly in some of the writing. At this date none of that is going to change, so simply enjoy the movie for itself.

It's a fantasy which makes it your broccoli and spinach salad with cod liver oil dressing. So, please move on and let the rest of us enjoy it.This is not to say the movie is without flaws. It's got them. K&L has been out for a couple of years now and people still complain about Leopold's suit and plot holes and the supposed incest. Interestingly, when I first read a very early blurb about the movie it said that Leopold was from 200 years in the past, which would have put him in about the Regency era. The 200 years would have also pushed the 'incest' concern back another three or four generations. It would also have explained his Regency style getup. The folks who were doing the counting on this incest thing would have to have at least admitted that at 6 or 7 generations removed, Kate and Start would have only shared something like 1\/138th blood. That's a bit less than the 1\/4 it would be for second cousins marrying, etc. If you keep it at 100 or so years separation, it would still be around 1\/16th shared blood. But even that kind of thinking means we're getting away from 'it's a fantasy, folks!'I have a few personal gripes about the movie. When it was out at the theater I saw it twice. Not a usual occurrence for me, even with Hugh Jackman's hunky persona. Frankly, during the first viewing, I could not get past Meg Ryan's hair. I was literally stunned by it. She's such a pretty woman, it amazes me that she thinks (or thought) that the Cookie the Clown haircut was cute. Not! Ms. Ryan, what were you thinking? Was this a mid-life crisis reaction?I've gotten used to Ms. Ryan's hair now and just don't see it anymore. But her performance, seemed to be Meg Ryan phoning is as Meg Ryan.
