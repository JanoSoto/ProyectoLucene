","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"14 February 2015","score":"","review":" Krzysztof Kieślowski's Three Colors trilogy is his final cinematic work and revolves around the three colors of the French flag blue, white and red, and the ideals which they represent (liberty, equality, fraternity), as well as why these ideals are irrelevant or impossible on an emotional basis. At one point, Kieślowski was editing Blue while shooting White and writing Red.Blue is the first film of the trilogy and centers around liberty and why it could be just an untouchable value. The subject takes the form of Julie (Juliette Binoche), the wife of a famous composer who died in a car accident, same as her daughter. After the accident, Julie cuts all her ties with her past and tries to live completely isolated and free of social bounds.The visual outlook may be self-explanatory concerning the title; there are lots and lots of various shades of blue scattered throughout the film, be it through a blue glass mobile leitmotif, filtering blue lights overwhelming the screen, and Julie's face, symbolizing the memories that haunt her (other times, this is done by blacking out the image and returning to the very frame that Kieślowski faded out from), or just plain blue objects. Other times, the French flag in its entirety is shown, like in the shot where Julie carries a box which says Blanco (Spanish for white) and is passed by on the right by a woman in red and passed by on the left by a man in blue.According to Kieślowski, different people at different parts of the world but at the same time think the same things. This theme is almost an obsession of mine, that people in different places and for different reasons think the same thing. This idea manifests itself in other of his films, but is also present in Blue, in the form of a street musician who plays the unreleased tune composed by Julie's dead husband - the tune which the street artist had no possible way of hearing and invented it himself.Sometimes, Kieślowski will turn to small details to carry the plot, like when Julie touches a cup of coffee with a sugar cube. The coffee soaks in, so Julie drops the cube into the cup. Kieślowski explains that in her state of isolation, Julie turns to little things to escape the big picture, such as scraping her hand against a stone wall in order to substitute big emotional pain with smaller physical pain.The main message is that true freedom is a delusion and that it's counterintuitive to the point to cut all ties with the world. Julie spends a good portion of runtime dipping in a large pool, which gives her an illusory sense of freedom. But she becomes truly fulfilled only in the final scene, where she makes love to her friend, ironically in a claustrophobic glassy box which contrasts the wide open pool of before.As is par with the course with Kieślowski, there are many symbols, most of which relate to Julie's past coming back to her (the mouse family she takes out with a cat may symbolize the sense of maternity she lost), or the difficulties of starting life anew because it'll all bounce back to the past again (like the bungee jumpers on Julie's mom's TV). The movie ends with both a birth and a rebirth; the husband's mistress' baby on the ultrasound monitor being shown side to side with Julie finding new life while having sex with her friend in a glass bubble.Blue is a wonderful synthesis of image and sound, like pretty much all of Kieślowski's works, and presents a thought-provoking allegorical story with great acting, an interesting use of music to carry the plot, and some fantastic cinematography.
