Jackie Mason is the focal point here taking the Rodney Dangerfield role from the first.  Here is one of the problems; he isn't nearly as funny or likable as Dangerfield.  The scenes with his daughter also get annoying as it gets somewhat serious at times.  Chevy reprises his role as Ty, but other than the fact he goes nananana he almost is a different character.  Dan Akroyd sort of takes the place of Bill Murray's character and has a few funny lines, but his performance will not make anyone forget Bill Murray from the first one.  Also, you do not have special appearances in a movie, when that appears it just makes your whole movie seem a bit generic.  Also, both Chevy and Dan were in the movie more than say Marsha Warfield who is listed ahead of them.

In `It's a Wonderful Life' Mr. Potter represents this idea of America, because he is the business man that does not care about people, only money.

Mr. Potter is America as the world views it,  selfish, unkind, and greedy. But many do not think about the individuals of America who care and love this country and others who live in it.

Many people forget this as they think about America outside or inside of the United States. The acting of `It's a Wonderful Life' is wonderful, the sweet love, and simple mind of Clarence could convince any scrooge to love life.

Here's a film so full of clichés and tired ideas that somehow--miraculously--manage to stay fresh, presenting us with a great love story amidst an intriguing backdrop of murder and revenge. The only problem with the movie is Demi Moore's haircut, but that's an entirely different matter.The story is classic Sam (Patrick Swayze) is a successful accountant earning the big bucks in the big city. He's got it all A great job, a great apartment, a great girlfriend to share it with, and an overall great life. Curled up in bed with his girl, Molly (Demi Moore), he watches a news program stating that an airplane crashed and everyone aboard the aircraft died. Just imagine, he says. In an instant--just like that. Bam. He is, of course, referring to the instantaneity of death.The irony in the situation is that we all know the same thing is about to happen to him, and indeed it does, when Sam is shot dead in front of Molly by a mysterious stranger who runs off into the night. Sam dies immediately, and it takes us a few moments to realize this--since we continue to see him run after the killer. It's then that it dawns on us it's his ghost.Unable to make contact with the living, Sam follows Molly for weeks preceding his death. (This is where that SNL skit came in--Oh, Molly, don't do that, it's disgusting! There's a tissue right across the room! I've got a bit more info on that later on.) However, Sam soon realizes that his old friend and fellow accountant (Tony Goldwyn) had hired a man to shoot Sam because he had seen evidence of money laundering in one of the accounts.Now, in order to warn Molly of possible danger, Sam enlists the help of a psychic hoax (Whoopi Goldberg) to pay a visit to Molly and tell her the truth about everything. Go away! she yells as Sam taunts her with obnoxious songs until she agrees to tag along and go visit his old girlfriend.It's useless to delve any deeper into the plot, since it's all pretty predictable. But in all honesty, it's a fun ride getting to the end. This is a film that uses a tried-and-true formula of good vs. evil to achieve its goals. It's as old as the days and as true as nothing. I'm reminded of that speech about principals by Donald Kaufman in Adaptation This works, and it has through all recorded time. No doubt he had Ghost in mind when he said that. (I'm just joking.)I do like the way Ghost uses its ideas of a ghost coming back to haunt his killer in a way different than most films, though. This ghost's intentions aren't to scare away people in a haunted mansion, but rather to reach out and touch the woman he once loved, and then--finally--to keep her from harm by seeking revenge on the baddies who plotted against him.I like the way one of the villains gets trapped in a bathroom and glances at a steamy window. The word, Boo suddenly appears as if someone was writing it, and with a scream the criminal flees the room and runs out into the street outside.If this were a horror film, the window gag might creep us out a bit and give us a chill or two. But Ghost uses the old ghost clichés--haunting people, making writing appear on windows, etc.--and makes us re-think them. Maybe that bartender from The Shining wasn't just a creepy old ghost. Maybe he was just having a bit of fun with Jack.Or...maybe not.That's where the film succeeds, I think in its ideas, even if they have been done before. I also enjoyed Patrick Swayze's performance. Swayze is often ridiculed as an actor, and this caused him to sink back into the depths of unemployment for a number of years--now appearing in co-star roles and low-budget films--but I think he's a good actor with a likable on-screen personality. And he doesn't take himself too seriously, which is always a good thing. (Anybody see that Hans and Franz skit on Saturday Night Live about ten years ago? Utterly hilarious. How about the Ghost parody?)Okay, so Whoopi Goldberg didn't deserve the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Everyone knows it was just because the Academy was in a certain mood that year, where it felt that it had to give its appreciation to the black community of filmmakers, but it's a done deal and the movie is still a good love story, regardless of whether or not one of its actresses didn't deserve an award for her work.

Titanic WAS a very good movie- and since I was interested in the actual ship a decade before the movie was made, hopefully I can tell you why I support it. The technical achievements alone were grand, the scale of the movie was epic and moving, and to James Cameron's credit, it was almost 100% accurate to the many different details of the Titanic legend. Of course, to accept this one has to ignore the fact that the main characters are fictitious amalgams of real Titanic passengers.Those two characters are Jack Dawson and Rose Buttaker, played of course by the leads Dicaprio and Winslet. Their awkward meeting and subsequent falling in love is played against the oncoming disaster, which, as everyone should know, happened 4 days into the ship's first voyage. At 1140pm on April 14, 1912, the Titanic hit an iceberg and sank 2 and a half hours later.Now for the movie itself. The acting, although passionate, is goofy at times due to a script that was much maligned as being stereotypical and bland. I don't hate it that much, it doesn't sound too far off from what people are like when they're stupid in love. However, my problem arises here Rose seems to be witty and independent, yet she becomes a doe-eyed child when she falls for Jack, who seems to know the answer to everything and even needs to heroically command Rose to get back when the iceberg comes by. More and more their relationship turns from possible to downright one-dimensional, as Jack becomes a grand hero and Rose becomes a helpless damsel. Granted, each character has scenes where they betray that limit (Rose in fact saves Jack's life at one point), but that's an exception to the rule. Another problem is that, quite simply, a relationship between a first class woman and third class male is possible, although entirely improbable. People just weren't that open minded in 1912, although for this movie it doesn't seem too severely hard to swallow.That having been said, I don't have much of a problem with the rest of the movie. This is because it stays admirably close to the facts, and pays insane amounts of detail to each scene. Director Cameron was in fact often joked about due to his fierce, almost anal commitment to the details. The ship looks real, because most of it is. The band played until the very end, which they really did. The ship indeed broke in half at the 2nd funnel, and if you look close, the iceberg scrape actually dots and dents the ship's hull instead of tearing a solid gash, as it actually did in real life. Although the 1958 Titanic film A Night to Remember had no fictitous characters and sticks religiously close to what really happened, James Cameron's Titanic is technically the most accurate, especially due to the breaking of the ship which wasn't proven until after the former film was made. A couple technical slips do get by, such as a terrible blue screen effect seen when the drunken baker is standing atop the risen stern (just before the final sinking). There's a shot of victims rolling down the upright stern section near the end, and we can see one of them bounce off of the cylindrical capstans, obviously a soft prop. But hey, these are just gaffes in an otherwise very good technical achievement.In closing, I still like this movie, as I did when it first came out (though not nearly as much now, after a dozen viewings). It has a lot of emotional impact, it stays very, very close to the actual facts, and it can even be argued that although fictional, Jack and Rose are just an example of what really happened to many of the couples on the real ship when it went down. I don't think a better movie about the Titanic can be made, although the aforementioned Night to Remember is also extremely good and in many ways just like James Cameron's film. If you see Titanic, the film, for what it tried to achieve, you can see that it is in fact a well made and successful film. I know it's hard to get past the negativity that its oversaturation caused, but at its heart I think it is an excellent movie.

I had heard that it was basically a 15 million dollar film about the tyrannical rule of the Roman emperor Caligula, complete with hard-core pornography. What struck me was that it was a porno movie yet it had great thespians like Peter O'Toole, John Geilgud, Malcolm McDowell and Hellen Mirren in it!!??  A week ago I saw a documentary about Caligula on the History channel and this film came back into my head and finally my curiousity got the best of me, I foolishly rented the DVD and even more foolishly watched it.Within the first 30 minutes I was seeing acts of sex and especially violence that would earn an NC-17 even by todays standards. Was it really necessary to have a scene of a man having his urinary track closed and then have gallons of wine poured into him and then have his stomach cut with a sword (all in very graphic detail). And a scene where a guy gets his d*** cut off and fed to dogs (again in very graphic detail)....and this just scratches the surface. The argument for this movie from those who like it seems that it is the only film that honestly portrays pagan Rome and it's excesses. When in fact what this movie really is, is sheer exploitation. From beginning to end you see nothing but endless torture, and decapitations and every kind of violence and crude behavior imaginable (sadomasochism, rape, necrophelia, it just never stopped). There is no insight into Caligula himself, what might have propelled him to go mad, the horrible childhood he had that molded him into a sadist as an adult. This is not a historic film, it is sleaze. Even the porn in this movie stinks, and through much of this when I wasn't gagging I was just incredibly bored. By the time it was over I was depressed, didn't feel much like eating and this movie does the impossible, it actually can turn you off of sex.What were these great actors thinking when they got into this. I did read that the porn segments were filmed after the principal shooting was completed (which explains why none of the main actors are in any of these scenes and why the quality of these scenes is so poor). But still and all these actors must have known what they were getting into. Right at the opening credits it says Penthouse Magazine and Bob Gucionne Presents. And the scenes that the famous actors actually take part in are completely repulsive in and of themselves. Apparently director Tinto Brass wanted his name removed from the completed film entirely, as did the screenwriter (Gore Vidal of all people). Even John Geilgud and Peter O'toole were begging people not to see this when it opened at the Cannes film festival.For the amount of money the producers spent on this, the movie's quality is terrible. Everything is underlit and murky as if the film was dropped in a swamp prior to being developed, and that's when you're lucky enough to view a scene that's actually in-focus. The sound is poorly dubbed, much of the music is awkward and the editing is god awful.Anyway, I brought this movie on myself.

They are made up of a couple of natural leaders and an army of skinheads who want nothing more than to drink beer, thrash to hate metal bands, and look scary. Few of them came their hate naturally; the charismatic leaders find teens who feel disenfranchised by life and tell them that it's the fault of blacks, of Hispanics, of Jews. The lonely kids, hungering for a sense of family, seize on this and begin to truly believe it, and another skinhead is born.`The Believer' opens with Ryan Gosling (who also shone in the tepid `Murder by Numbers', filmed after this but released first) and his gang showing up at a small white power meeting in a nice house hosted by Theresa Russell and a wigged Billy Zane. Zane and Russell want to get their point across by getting candidates into office and corrupting from within; Gosling just wants to kill a Jewish person. He even knows which one, a powerful banker. His idea is discounted, but his charisma and knowledge aren't. No one knows his real reason for wanting to kill this man; that he too is Jewish.This movie, with it's many speeches and explorations of the Jewish religion, could have been awful; offensive, boring, and absurd. But Gosling is portrayed as smart and conflicted rather than a megalomaniac or a goon. As a child, he sat through Jewish study classes and then brought up points for debate that he didn't feel comfortable with. But rather than taking the time to answer the boy's questions, the teacher kicks him out of class. This fosters resentment towards the faith, which eventually turns to rage and hate.But Gosling still loves the faith; he simply hates those who practice it. He grows angry when members of his gang curse in front of an unrolled Torah scroll. He snaps at his girlfriend when she parades naked in front of it. He has cut himself off from all of his old friends, the Jewish ones, and he no longer sees them as people. They are just the enemy.The white power group lets him become a public speaker for them, turning aside his dreams of murder. But, with his gang beside him, he taunts and attacks Jews, slowly working up towards his first murder with the help of a silent sniper. All around him, people are puzzled; he walks the walk of hatred, but he doesn't quite talk the talk. Their suspicions grow as Gosling's girlfriend thinks about converting to Judaism and he runs into his old childhood friends. The film builds quietly and effectively to a natural, powerful climax.Gosling is powerful as the character. The rest of the cast is solid but never noteworthy; whether they were simply overshadowed by Gosling or told to underplay cannot be known. But this is Gosling's show, and the young actor brings pitch-perfect shades and textures to the role. Those who oppose films like this dislike it when they humanize this sort of character and make us see him as a person rather than as a symbol of hate. In `American History X', as good as it was, Edward Norton's character was either a cartoon of a scary, homicidal skinhead or a repentant young man; both sides were not allowed to exist at the same time. `The Believer' bravely allows conflict in a person who hates; it makes his dilemma both understandable and confounding.

The lonely kids, hungering for a sense of family, seize on this and begin to truly believe it, and another skinhead is born.`The Believer' opens with Ryan Gosling (who also shone in the tepid `Murder by Numbers', filmed after this but released first) and his gang showing up at a small white power meeting in a nice house hosted by Theresa Russell and a wigged Billy Zane. Zane and Russell want to get their point across by getting candidates into office and corrupting from within; Gosling just wants to kill a Jewish person. He even knows which one, a powerful banker. His idea is discounted, but his charisma and knowledge aren't. No one knows his real reason for wanting to kill this man; that he too is Jewish.This movie, with it's many speeches and explorations of the Jewish religion, could have been awful; offensive, boring, and absurd. But Gosling is portrayed as smart and conflicted rather than a megalomaniac or a goon. As a child, he sat through Jewish study classes and then brought up points for debate that he didn't feel comfortable with. But rather than taking the time to answer the boy's questions, the teacher kicks him out of class. This fosters resentment towards the faith, which eventually turns to rage and hate.But Gosling still loves the faith; he simply hates those who practice it. He grows angry when members of his gang curse in front of an unrolled Torah scroll. He snaps at his girlfriend when she parades naked in front of it. He has cut himself off from all of his old friends, the Jewish ones, and he no longer sees them as people. They are just the enemy.The white power group lets him become a public speaker for them, turning aside his dreams of murder. But, with his gang beside him, he taunts and attacks Jews, slowly working up towards his first murder with the help of a silent sniper. All around him, people are puzzled; he walks the walk of hatred, but he doesn't quite talk the talk. Their suspicions grow as Gosling's girlfriend thinks about converting to Judaism and he runs into his old childhood friends. The film builds quietly and effectively to a natural, powerful climax.Gosling is powerful as the character. The rest of the cast is solid but never noteworthy; whether they were simply overshadowed by Gosling or told to underplay cannot be known. But this is Gosling's show, and the young actor brings pitch-perfect shades and textures to the role. Those who oppose films like this dislike it when they humanize this sort of character and make us see him as a person rather than as a symbol of hate. In `American History X', as good as it was, Edward Norton's character was either a cartoon of a scary, homicidal skinhead or a repentant young man; both sides were not allowed to exist at the same time. `The Believer' bravely allows conflict in a person who hates; it makes his dilemma both understandable and confounding. And with Gosling, they have found the perfect actor to express these feelings realistically, without caricature.
