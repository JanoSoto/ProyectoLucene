Forget? Yes, because Shrek will give you a reminder of nearly all of them, and 'The Matrix' along the way, but with a cunning and subtle twist. This is real off-the-wall stuff.Here we have a masterful telling of a fairy story with a difference, full of charm, hilarity, sendups, a dragon (you can not have a fairy story without a dragon), a Princess, a hero, talking animals, and, did I mention the dragon. Shrek has all this, but it also has more.  The characterisations are superb and it is tightly plotted with a sharp script, and excellent voice choices; Eddie Murphy (The Donkey)is superb, but Mike Myers (Shrek) is even better. Brilliant takes on the traditional Disneyesque animation and characters, and a barrel-load of laughs, a truck-load even.The plot sound conventional; hero on a quest to rescue Princess from dragon blah blah.  But this is a fairy story as Wayne's World might have produced it, and although rated 'U', kids stuff it ain't.  Oh, there is plenty in here for the under 10's, but it is the adults who are going to enjoy this even more.  They are the ones who are going to get the in-jokes and references, and keep alert because there are stacks of 'em.In a nutshell, Lord Farquaad (Lithgow in wonderful form), the evil ruler, has banned all fairy tale creatures and sent them into exile so his Kingdom would be perfect.  Unfortunately, he sent them to the swamp, Shrek's swamp, where he likes to be alone.  In an effort to get his swamp back, Shrek visits Lord F. and ends of being tricked into a quest to rescue the feisty Princess Fiona(Diaz) because Farquaad need to marry a real princess to be a real King. So the quest begins, and Shrek, by this time saddled with the talking Donkey sets off.Along the way they run into the aforementioned dragon, a French Robin Hood with his riverdancing Merry Men and so many visual treats we don't have time to repeat, before delivering the Princess to Farquaad, and getting his swamp back.  BUT.... in the meantime, he has fallen in love with the Princess. But is she all she seems?  Well... nope!Does the 'hero' get his reward?  Ah, that would be telling.  Suffice to say that things did not turn out as our family thought they would!  Yes, it is a 'message' film, but then, fairy stories always were.  But it is not 'preachy'.Incidently, along the way there were some useful fishing tips as well....Shrek will make you laugh, maybe cry, and laugh some more and the music is suitably off-beat (another swing at the saccharine Disney?) with the best rendition of The Monkees, 'I'm a Believer', we've ever heard.

But I still went watch it because I want to see it for myself. What I heard is Disney ripped off a Japanese animate called ¡§Nadia - The secret of blue water (Gainax - 1991).Let¡¦s put it aside from our head thinking the fact that whether Disney did it or not, it¡¦s true that the quality of Disney animation is declining. You don¡¦t agree with me? Fine. Remember the Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and Lion King? Even Hercules, or Tarzan. Think of those animations for a moment, please. Compare Atlantis to those 90¡¦s Disney classics you will understand what I mean by losing quality on their works.Let¡¦s talk about character art. Comparing Milo (the main character), Audrey (the mechanic girl) or Helga (the blond sexy lady), you will find them don¡¦t really match. It seems like characters from different animation. I am not saying they don¡¦t match in the story but the way animators drew them. On the other hand, don¡¦t you think the mask princess Kida wears and how she moves are quite similar to Princess Mononoke?Then how about the story? To me the story seems a bit fast pace. Within 30 minutes of the movie, we already watch the crew found Atlantis. There¡¦s nothing wrong with a fast pace, but a good story requires time to built up the relationship between characters.

The way the video was packaged made it look as though this was a film about a sales convention, but it wasn't.  It was a film about people, and how deceptive first appearances can be.  Based on the play 'Hospitality Suite' this was wisely still performed as though it was a play, with very little in the way of shots outside the hotel suite where the three main players are staying for the duration of the convention.  If you give Kevin Spacey good dialogue then he can always be relied upon to deliver, and this he does, in spades.  However, Danny de Vito was an absolute revelation as the tired, vulnerable divorced salesman who reveals a depth of understanding of other people's vulnerability and failings that's at odds with his perceived persona.  The friendship between him and Spacey, and the way de Vito's character grows as Spacey's shrinks, is wonderful to watch.  The third character, the God-loving, upright and morally superior young man, serves as a catalyst for the character development in the film, but he too changes - or changes in the eyes of the viewers - as the film moves towards its end.  As is so often the case in real life, there is no real conclusion,  but the intensity of the dialogue and the brilliance of de Vito and Spacey make this one of the most rewarding, and under-valued films I've ever seen.

His unfriendly coworkers try to goad him into speaking with her but he instead winds up bumping into the devil, portrayed without much gusto by Elizabeth Hurley.  The inevitable pact gets made, and Fraser continually finds himself about three giant steps away from achieving his wish.  O'Conner as a sports journalist shows profound interest in towering basketball star Fraser until she gets a peek at his tiny penis.  Fraser as a sensitive type proves too much for O'Conner who walks off with a guy that promises to drink beer and ignore her.  After a few more tales of missed targets, Fraser learns a lesson and wanders off to find a relatively happy ending.  Sadly, Fraser has little comic sensibility, far less than Dudley Moore, who played the character with pathos well beyond his imitator's capabilities.  Hurley's role does not even allow for comparison to Peter Cook's devil; she would have been much better suited to portray Lillian Lust (done suitably by Raquel Welch in the original).  Her presence makes itself known primarily through her skimpy outfits.  Although most criticisms indicates she casts a more striking presence than Cook, I'd much rather see his slightest sarcastic facial expression than Hurley's gaudy sexuality.  The original Bedazzled draped its comedy against a wildly anarchistic structure.  Not so Harold Ramis's redo, which maintains a very traditional character progression and a horrifyingly facile moral conclusion that seems to indicate without irony that solace can be found in skin-deep beauty.  Perhaps my greatest complaint, however, would be the almost nauseating amount of product placement, kicked off by Fraser getting a Burger King meal as his first wish, which gives the movie a distinctly corporate Hollywood flavor.  Nevertheless, Ramis tends to craft comedies with decent, occasionally brilliant, success, and this film does indeed have its funny moments.  Most of these come from the more outwardly (and pleasantly) offensive story twists, such as the aforementioned small penis episode and when Fraser leads O'Conner to his room, where he suddenly remember that he's gay.  Versatile Orlando Jones and Ramis regular Brian Doyle-Murray show up for some pleasantly amusing roles and O'Conner is rapidly becoming the subject of a big crush on my part (I'm of the opinion she's far sexier than the overdone Ms. Hurley).  Without a doubt, Ramis has created a perfectly acceptable film, but he would have done much better to come up with an original story to structure the jokes around; the film remakes Cook and Moore's original in name only, and Ramis achieves precious little by utilizing the name.

Masterful horror films are rare; among the best are Jaws, The Exorcist, and John Carpenter's The Thing.  The Howling doesn't rank that highly, but it is nonetheless a mostly well-made horror film that provides good late-night chills.  Werewolf movies are mostly bad (check out this one's sequels), and this could very well be the best of its kind, though I will admit it's been awhile since I've seen An American Werewolf in London.Karen White (Dee-Wallace Stone), a popular news anchor, has been arranged to meet a man who calls himself Eddie, a serial killer who has a special interest in Karen herself.  With the police following along, they follow her into a porno shop, where they proceed to kill Eddie.  Karen is haunted by the events that occur, and she can no longer remember what exactly happened in her short meeting with Eddie.  She is recommended by Dr. George Waggner (Patrick Mcknee) to take part and stay awhile in this experimental colony he has up north in the woods.  She gladly obliges, and is accompanied by her caring husband, Bill (Christopher Stone).The first few days at The Colony are relatively relaxing for Karen.  Even though she's startled a bit by Marsha (Elisabeth Brooks) and her feral brother, T.C.  But at night, she notices strange things, such as frightening and piercing howls that sound unlike anything she's ever heard.  She also finds dead cows in the forest.  Inviting her friends and co-workers, Chris (Dennis Dugan) and Terri (Belinda Balaski) over, they investigate the place and begin to uncover its sinister secrets.Director Joe Dante seemed to be making two movies.  The Howling's first half is slow-moving, plodding, and not nearly as interesting a set-up as it should have been.  The serial killer subplot is treated as a second tier, and isn't tied in to the main story particularly well.  A couple of scenes are also more cheesy than frightening, such as the first sight of a werewolf, which looks more like a giant puppet than any lycanthrope.But Dante improves the film significantly in the second half, creating a lot of suspenseful scenes, as well as one truly terrifying moment when a werewolf suddenly appears in a scene in the most unexpected fashion.  From around the 50-minute or so mark right up to the final scene, The Howling is absolutely riveting.  The famous werewolf transformations are also a sight to behold.Working to the movie's advantage is the setting, since it's always fun to watch a horror flick set in the woods.  Sometimes, when it's done well, a la The Evil Dead, you can have a lot of fun watching it.  The Howling falls into that category and the setting helps enforce the atmosphere and tone.  The constant amount of fog and mist is a bit annoying, but it's easy to get over that once the fun sets in. Watching this film (particularly the second half) gives me an added appreciation and sense of nostalgia for the way horror films were styled in the 80's.  The Howling relies quite a bit on its great sense of atmosphere, setting, and mood.  This isn't a teeny-bopper film with a serial killer running around, slashing people everywhere.  The situation presented is scary, and Dante plays many of these moments out the right way. There are some other flaws, however.  Character development is given a good attempt, and it does work somewhat, but I never quite got behind Karen White as much as I felt I should have.  Dee-Wallace Stone delivers a decent performance, but is hampered by a script that doesn't fully flesh out her character.  Of course, good attempts like this are still better than your average horror film.  Christopher Stone as her husband is fairly lifeless, not so much bad as he is given not a whole lot of material to work with.  Dennis Dugan and Brenda Balaski are both good as Karen's friends, with Dugan exuding what seems to be genuinely likable personality.  These days, he's mostly well-known for directing a few Adam Sandler films.Robert Picardo as Eddie has very little screen time, but is appropriately chilling in the scenes he's in.  Elisabeth Brooks is especially creepy as a (possibly) nymphomaniac werewolf with an attraction towards Bill.  She also bears a startling resemblance to Angelina Jolie.I've read from many reviewers and critics that this film is supposed to be a partial comedy.  While there are a few laughs, they seem more like the usual comic relief you'd see rather than all-out horrific humor Evil Dead 2 or The Return of the Living Dead style.  This is more suspense and horror than comedy, for sure.  The biggest laugh probably comes near the end, which also manages to be a fairly poignant scene, surprisingly enough.  Dante really balanced out that one scene almost perfectly.Of course, what review of The Howling could go by without mentioning the visual effects, which are part of this film's fame.  Some parts are definitely cheesy by today's standards, but the werewolf transformations are very well-done.  Makeup artist Rob Bottin showed true talent in creating a believable and formidable monster.  Credit must also be given for the lack of extreme gore effects.  There are some violent and bloody scenes, but compared to many other horror films, this one is relatively restraint and is all the better for it.  The emphasis on suspense over blood is always welcome.    So, The Howling comes as a recommendation from me.  I enjoyed much of it, found a lot to like and appreciate, though to get to the film's meaty parts (pun intended), you still have to bear through a relatively dull beginning.  It's still definitely worth watching. ","genre":null},{"date":"24 June 2001","score":"","review":"  ** 1\/2 out of ****The Howling is considered by many to be a horror classic.

It's still definitely worth watching. ","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"24 June 2001","score":"","review":"  ** 1\/2 out of ****The Howling is considered by many to be a horror classic.  I'm not sure I would quite call it that.  Masterful horror films are rare; among the best are Jaws, The Exorcist, and John Carpenter's The Thing.  The Howling doesn't rank that highly, but it is nonetheless a mostly well-made horror film that provides good late-night chills.  Werewolf movies are mostly bad (check out this one's sequels), and this could very well be the best of its kind, though I will admit it's been awhile since I've seen An American Werewolf in London.Karen White (Dee-Wallace Stone), a popular news anchor, has been arranged to meet a man who calls himself Eddie, a serial killer who has a special interest in Karen herself.  With the police following along, they follow her into a porno shop, where they proceed to kill Eddie.  Karen is haunted by the events that occur, and she can no longer remember what exactly happened in her short meeting with Eddie.  She is recommended by Dr. George Waggner (Patrick Mcknee) to take part and stay awhile in this experimental colony he has up north in the woods.  She gladly obliges, and is accompanied by her caring husband, Bill (Christopher Stone).The first few days at The Colony are relatively relaxing for Karen.  Even though she's startled a bit by Marsha (Elisabeth Brooks) and her feral brother, T.C.  But at night, she notices strange things, such as frightening and piercing howls that sound unlike anything she's ever heard.  She also finds dead cows in the forest.  Inviting her friends and co-workers, Chris (Dennis Dugan) and Terri (Belinda Balaski) over, they investigate the place and begin to uncover its sinister secrets.Director Joe Dante seemed to be making two movies.  The Howling's first half is slow-moving, plodding, and not nearly as interesting a set-up as it should have been.  The serial killer subplot is treated as a second tier, and isn't tied in to the main story particularly well.  A couple of scenes are also more cheesy than frightening, such as the first sight of a werewolf, which looks more like a giant puppet than any lycanthrope.But Dante improves the film significantly in the second half, creating a lot of suspenseful scenes, as well as one truly terrifying moment when a werewolf suddenly appears in a scene in the most unexpected fashion.  From around the 50-minute or so mark right up to the final scene, The Howling is absolutely riveting.  The famous werewolf transformations are also a sight to behold.Working to the movie's advantage is the setting, since it's always fun to watch a horror flick set in the woods.  Sometimes, when it's done well, a la The Evil Dead, you can have a lot of fun watching it.  The Howling falls into that category and the setting helps enforce the atmosphere and tone.  The constant amount of fog and mist is a bit annoying, but it's easy to get over that once the fun sets in. Watching this film (particularly the second half) gives me an added appreciation and sense of nostalgia for the way horror films were styled in the 80's.  The Howling relies quite a bit on its great sense of atmosphere, setting, and mood.  This isn't a teeny-bopper film with a serial killer running around, slashing people everywhere.  The situation presented is scary, and Dante plays many of these moments out the right way. There are some other flaws, however.  Character development is given a good attempt, and it does work somewhat, but I never quite got behind Karen White as much as I felt I should have.  Dee-Wallace Stone delivers a decent performance, but is hampered by a script that doesn't fully flesh out her character.  Of course, good attempts like this are still better than your average horror film.  Christopher Stone as her husband is fairly lifeless, not so much bad as he is given not a whole lot of material to work with.  Dennis Dugan and Brenda Balaski are both good as Karen's friends, with Dugan exuding what seems to be genuinely likable personality.  These days, he's mostly well-known for directing a few Adam Sandler films.Robert Picardo as Eddie has very little screen time, but is appropriately chilling in the scenes he's in.  Elisabeth Brooks is especially creepy as a (possibly) nymphomaniac werewolf with an attraction towards Bill.  She also bears a startling resemblance to Angelina Jolie.I've read from many reviewers and critics that this film is supposed to be a partial comedy.  While there are a few laughs, they seem more like the usual comic relief you'd see rather than all-out horrific humor Evil Dead 2 or The Return of the Living Dead style.  This is more suspense and horror than comedy, for sure.  The biggest laugh probably comes near the end, which also manages to be a fairly poignant scene, surprisingly enough.  Dante really balanced out that one scene almost perfectly.Of course, what review of The Howling could go by without mentioning the visual effects, which are part of this film's fame.  Some parts are definitely cheesy by today's standards, but the werewolf transformations are very well-done.  Makeup artist Rob Bottin showed true talent in creating a believable and formidable monster.  Credit must also be given for the lack of extreme gore effects.  There are some violent and bloody scenes, but compared to many other horror films, this one is relatively restraint and is all the better for it.  The emphasis on suspense over blood is always welcome.    So, The Howling comes as a recommendation from me.  I enjoyed much of it, found a lot to like and appreciate, though to get to the film's meaty parts (pun intended), you still have to bear through a relatively dull beginning.  It's still definitely worth watching.

The opening scenes of the movie are quite amusing. We see a screaming male wheeled into an operating room on a gurney. He has the infamous metal hooks and chains hanging from his shredded flesh and we can immediately identify this to the joyous work of Pinhead and his cenobites. As the doctors calm the screaming male, a sadistic nurse lays out weird-shaped and rather deadly looking implements on the table behind him. This really has nothing to do with the story, but it gives you the sense that these people aren't really Doctors and nurses. Before they can operate on the male, the chains spring to life and rip his body apart and we are introduced to the central character of this story.Joey is a struggling reporter who decides to cover this particular story. She talks to the victim's girlfriend, Terri, who explains that all of these things happened after he played around with a 'puzzlebox' that he stole from an antique collector. Terri gives the puzzlebox to a sleazy club owner who she once slept with and he unleashes Pinhead and his cenobites once again as he accidentally opens up the portal that connects Hell with Earth.The fun starts here once Pinhead gatecrashes a popular night club called The Boiler Room. This is actually the highlight of the whole movie. As the patrons run towards the chained doors, each one is killed in a brutal yet hilarious fashion. One female patron has a spear of ice jutted into her open mouth. A male patron gets three snooker balls shoved down his mouth!! You basically see a lot of people getting hoisted into the air with chains and whatnot, but we get to see very elaborate killings. When some of the unfortunate victims return as cenobites, Joey discovers that she's stumbled upon more than just a hot scoop. Actually, the cenobites in this movie are the most creative out of the whole series. Joey's cameraman gets turned into a cenobite and he has his camera installed into his head! A disc jockey has the unfortunate experience of having CD's implanted into his head and further uses them like Ninja stars as he hurls them as weapons! A bartender concocts molotov cocktails as he 'shakes but not stirs' his 'special' drink as he throws them at police officers who fire pointlessly at them with their guns.The most hilarious scene is when Terri (now a cenobite) walks around with a cigarette poking out of the flesh of her exposed throat and she burns Joey with it. But all good things must come to an end once Joey sends them back to where they came from. Not much insight is given to Joey's character - but the viewer hasn't really come along for the ride to learn about someone we don't really care about. We all came to see Pinhead and his cenobites, and that's what we got! The only one real surprise about this installment was catching Kirsty in a cameo as an asylum lunatic trying to convince everyone that she has been to Hell and back. It is quite obvious she was placed in this scene as a special treat for all the Hellraiser fans out there as this scene was completely irrelevant to the storyline.While not the most memorable of the Hellraiser series, it certainly provides enough laughs for an hour and a half of fun.

Just be happy its not drugs.Nitrous Oxide was over used.  Especially on turbocharged cars.  Anyone who has ever tuned a turbocharged car knows that it is no small task. Maintaining a safe air-fuel ratio while maximizing power is tough.  Adding nitrous-oxide into the mix (which requires additional fuel to go with it) is damned near impossible.  Only the top of the line professional racers pull it off as a large power adder and do it safely.  The fact that almost every car in this movie has both a turbocharger AND nitrous is just ridiculous. HOWEVER.. with that being said, it definitely adds something to the suspense of the race scenes.  It gives the director the ability to make someone appear to be losing a race, and let them hit their NOS button at the last minute to start a come back and make it close.  So although it is a bit unrealistic that so many people would run nitrous oxide, it adds entertainment value to the film.So thats it!  The movie was extremely well done.  The editing is great, and there are some parts that really keep you on the edge of your seat.  It is by no means predictable, either.  There are many parts of the movie that could really go either way, and the director does a great job of keeping you in the dark until the scene ends.  The interaction between Brian, Mia, and Vince was great too.  You could feel the love Vince has for Dominic and his crew, and that he really feels he is protecting them from Brian.The characters are believable, and you really find yourself caring for them and what happens to them.

If you are judging Crouching Tiger in comparison to the cinema as a whole, it's great. But if you're comparing it to other martial arts films on their own terms, I've seen better.Some of the fight scenes are amazing, most notably the duel between the two female leads wherein they use pretty much every weapon known to man.  But some of them are a little on the silly side, with more of a floaty, matrixy feel to them than I would have liked.  One of the most disappointing scenes is where the younger female takes on a variety of silly combatants in a restaurant. This scene, ignoring it's similarity to countless others in martial arts farces past, is just too stupid to be funny, and is completely out of place in a movie of this variety.As you have no doubt heard, Crouching Tiger is pitched as the movie to entertain both sides of the audience (Mom will like the romance and drama, while Dad and the kids will cheer for the fastpaced fight scenes!)  If you ask me, those looking for Chinese atmosphere and sweeping romantic drama will enjoy this far more than martial arts fanatics, and that is not putting down martial arts fanatics.  The best thing about CTHD is the sweepingly beautiful cinematography, and the peerless direction by Ang Lee. In fact, the scene that stands out most, looking back on the film, is not a fight scene, but a graceful scene of Chow Yun-Fat practising with the green destiny in an empty courtyard.In short, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is either a good martial arts flick or a great film. It's just that some are labelling it among other things The most beautiful movie ever made and The best martial arts movie EVER, both of which are untrue.

I remember watching it again and again on a Beta videocassette, back when those were all the rage! I must have been around 6 or 7 years old back then, my english wasn't very good, so I couldn't understand almost anything about the picture. Still, I was just amazed to see a man could fly. And I remember all I could dream about back then was to fly, to stretch my arms just like Superman and to kiss this earth goodbye.A lot of years passed. Then, I heard the DVD was coming out, with tons of extra features. I had to buy it, for two reasons. One, I wanted to see just what did I miss by not understanding the entire movie. And second, I knew about Christopher Reeve's accident (actually, felt quite sorry for him) and I wanted to watch him on screen, since I had heard so much about his good acting in this film.After watching the entire DVD twice, I can say two things1) Kids, and people who didn't get to see this movie on theatres, won't like it. 2) If there is one person who can walk again after such an accident, Mr. Reeves is it. He can do it.First. Why wouldn't people like this film? Judging it from the modern comic perspective, this film is way too campy, light, good hearted and benign. Compare this to Batman, by Tim Burton (my favorite superhero, actually). His Batman is a tortured soul, doomed to wander through the world fighting criminals. He knows he will someday die, most probably on the streets. He is haunted by the memories of his past life. He is a sad soul whose days are counted. Superman, on the other hand, is pretty much invincible. He did lose his parents, but in a much less traumatic way. He lives the life of a geek, yet he knows he is vastly superior to anyone else on earth. In short, he knows nobody can harm him, and he is mentally sane.A boring superhero for the times. But for my generation, it was just about perfect. I lived at a time when rock music wasn't supposed to depress you, or to make you want to kill your neighbour, or where every other line wasn't an insult to an ethnic race. The music of my time was pretty uplifting. The movies were uplifting. So, it was only fitting to have a happy superhero in strong red and blue colors.Also, the special effects seem too dated. The sets are very similar to the Star Wars ones, but I must say Star Wars hasn't suffered the passing of the years as this movie has. Why? Simple. Star Wars had a guy dressed like a cowboy, another with a white robe, and everyones hair styles were kinda restrained. This movie has bellbottom pants, huge hairdos, weird glasses and jive talking. Not a good omen for staying power.Now, why do I think Christopher Reeve will be able to walk someday? Simple. He is the most perfect Superman anyone could ever hope for. He is good, really good, humble, intelligent. And it seems in real life he is the same. He seems to be perpetually cheerful, despite his current condition. He is in much more in touch with his humanity than many of us. He cares for the rest of the people, making donations fo the cause. And everyday, he fights to be able to move again. What a guy. Watching the movie on DVD, I couldn't stop a tear flowing through my eye just thinking that the man who once flew was now strapped to a wheelchair. One of the people who taught me to be good, kind, and just, was now passing through one of the worst situations a man can go through.In short, Mr. Reeve will be able to walk simply because he didn't play Superman.

And why, oh why, interpolate all that anachronistic dialogue (oddly reserved for the comic subplot only).  Cool?  Not!  In true Rankin\/Bass style the animation is flat.  While most all R&H tunes survive (thanks to a huge 80 piece orchestra and a game cast), Anna's speaking and singing voices are obviously not the same.  And while it's a neat idea to open up Getting To Know You outside the palace gates, how does Anna (new to Siam) know her way around?  Presumably, kids don't use logic. It's interesting to think that the writings of a conniving widow named Anna Owens (her husband's name was Leon; she thought the new name more regal) has evolved from a diary indulged with fiction, to a non-musical film, to a sentimental stage musical, to a sentimental film musical, to this!  King Mongkut and Mr. Leon should be spinning in their graves.

Good idea to have the King's son a studly young Prince instead of another adolescent, like Anna's foppish brat Louis.  That frees up Prince C. to romance Tuptim instead of the dull Lun Tha, which makes the story a bit more personal and inter-related.  Banished, too, is the mopey matron Lady Thiang.  And the ballet Small House of Uncle Thomas tends to stop the show dead anyway.  Poor Eliza!
