Though I'm not crazy for the film, I recognize the what it does right and I fully embrace what it masters. Film scholars and novelists say that everything produced in either medium draws ideas from Shakespeare's penned plays. West Side Story not only draws inspiration from Shakespeare's most recognizable play, but it almost acts as a remake of Romeo and Juliet. Too bad it doesn't hold the merit Romeo and Juliet does, but what revamped, modernized remake lives up to the quality of the dated original?As I stated earlier, the thing that allows West Side Story to be hung in the hall of great movie musicals is the dazzling choreography. It's the best choreographed film of all-time; name any musical or action movie, it doesn't hold a candle to West Side Story's accomplishment in this area. You could see the hours it took to create and polish each dance move; effort is key here. The dancing itself is performed by very talented theatrical actors who hit every mark perfectly. West Side Story bounces from ballads to dance numbers, which maybe is a good thing to allow the audience a moment to breathe from the overwhelming, rich extravaganzas.The direction by Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins is what elevates the movie and shows off the quality within the actors and off the page of the script. It's an insanely watchable movie that never complicates the viewer or makes them squirm. I was completely content because the direction strained out all the feelings I sometimes express during a movie such a discomfort, straying thoughts, and restlessness. Wise and Robbins make sure the audience is with them through every musical note that's played. It's stunning direction that creates a fresh and crisp feeling, which leaves the film with a beating pulse long even after you leave the theater or put the DVD back on the shelf.You may have never seen West Side Story in any form before, neither on stage nor through cinema, but I guarantee you have listened, danced to, or caught songs from the film in your head. I Feel Pretty is the classic song, expressing how love first affects a person. America succeeds as a strong dance and singing number creating a scene of exuberance. Gee, Officer Krupke is a hilarious sequence with intricate staging. Epic, emotional levels are reached in numbers such as A Boy Like That\/I Have a Love. And an adorably romantic scene is crafted in One Hand, One Heart. Combine catchy, deep music with the extraordinary choreography, West Side Story results in having many show stopping scenes.Acting in a musical is sometimes judged by how well the actor performs whatever musical number they're faced with. The singing and dancing are what is judged, not the acting. Darker musicals are usually successful in letting actors show their acting abilities as well as perform the songs to the best of they are capable of. West Side Story doesn't sacrifice its actors at the expense of music, yet only shows darkness selectively in the second half. Rita Moreno is the performer of West Side Story that will WOW your eyes out of their sockets. She is outstanding! There is so much of Anita throughout the film at different levels. Moreno creates a complete character if there ever was one, and she places at the near the top of the Supporting Actress list in history. George Chakiris is good in his role, but the real showcase of the supporting actors is Russ Tamblyn, who fires his vitality at you in every scene he's in. Natalie Wood succeeds inconsistently and unfortunately makes the lead character bland at time.Like I said Natalie Wood's humdrum interpretation halts from the overall quality at times, Richard Beymer who plays her romantic opposite is abysmal. Not only does Beymer detract from what West Side Story has going for it, but distracts the viewer from the greatness that's made around him. Beymer never convinced me once. In fact, the supporting cast trumped the leading actors, which made me dread the moment I knew the story had to switch from ensemble-driven sections to the lead couple scenes.West Side Story also tests out new methods of storytelling which doesn't support the overall quality it could have going for it. While most of the songs shimmer with greatness, there are the occasional few bad apples. The aspect that really keeps me at arm's length with West Side Story is the lack of affection I have for the source material. Though the direction plows through a lot of my distaste with it, traces of the musical I'm not a fan of obviously must appear. The way West Side Story tries to tear down the ethnic walls of society backfires as well.West Side Story has an amazing pace to it, I rarely looked at my watch and the film flew like a newly licensed teenager driving their parents car. Considering how much I actually liked the story that was being told, the film kept me focused and never slowed down. This is another hats off to the directors. They knew exactly what they wanted and attacked it with clarity. It's decorated with bright colors with almost a theatrical feel to it. Though it suffers through many obstacles, West Side Story accomplishes an incredible amount with its directing, choreography, and acting from Rita Moreno. Some of the film may not work, but what does work is breathtaking!Rating 8.5\/10Grade A- ","genre":null},{"date":"15 July 2013","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" West Side Story's success can be summed up thanks to three areas the direction, the choreography, and the music.

He played an interesting character and his performance was pure genius. I also liked the soundtrack done by Neil Young. I like his music and listening to him improvise the soundtrack is just amazing.So as far as the film goes, Dead Man is pretty good and interesting. I was hoping to be more drawn in by the lead performance but it didn't happen.

After all, the premise was cutting-edge in 1959 when the word 'panties' in Anatomy of a Murder raised a ruckus with enforcers of the film code.In that same year, just watching from a theatre seat during the cross-dressing, plus the many innuendo scenes was like being a daring part of taboo-breaking. The bawdy subtext was a totally new experience in the commercial movies. Thus the amusement factor was heightened by novel comedic material, previously forbidden. But I wonder about today's younger audiences for whom the innuendo may even seem a little tame, given today's almost non-existent standards.In my little book, it's still a funny movie, thanks mainly to an expert cast, but hardly an all- time topper as it is in some ratings lists. Besides, it's the only comedy I can think of to work its way around not just one, but two, on-screen massacres!

Turns out this is actually a darn good James Bond Movie, even if it does not even come close to the classic formula, and it filled with some of the most downright weird moments in any Bond Film. This Movie works for several reasons. The plot is not very complicated, and is actually rather grounded in reality, despite the voodoo stuff, which surprising does not hurt this film at all, and just adds an extra sense of mystery and foreboding to the plot and the locales. The Acting is actually some of the strongest in a Bond film, with a good, and very funny, and for the most part confident Roger Moore as Bond. Moore's Bond may be not very much like Fleming's character, but he is still my favorite portrayal because he is easily the most interesting and likable of the lot. Don't get me wrong, Connery, Dalton, Craig, Lazenby, and Brosnan are good in their own ways, and are far superior as the literary Bond, but I find that Moore is best all around action hero in general, and is the most accessible to outsiders\/non-fans of Bond. Acting from the villains are great, especially from Yaphet Kotto as Kananga and Julius Harris as Tee-Hee. Geoffrey Holder did not have a whole lot to do, but he left his mark on this film as the awesome Baron Samedi. His part in the ending is classic, gets my vote for the best bond ending of all time. Jane Seymour here does a decent, if a little bland and forgettable, performance as Solitaire. Still, she is far better than most of the other leading ladies like Britt Ekland, Tanya Roberts, Carole Bouquet, Cary Lowell, Halle Berry, Jill St. John, and Denise Richards, not to mention that she is easily one of the most attractive. The Stunts\/fights are uniformly good especially the fight with Tee-Hee on the train, and the bus chase. The Boat Chase was literally jaw dropping, but was nearly ruined by the worst part of the movie; Clifton James as Sheriff Pepper. He was funny for the first few minutes, but the scene just keep on going and going until he became a nuisance. He had nothing to do with the plot, and it would have been better if they just cut him out. The second worst thing is Rosie Carver, who was pretty enough, but had an annoying and grating character. Thankfully she is barely in the film, so it is not that big of a deal. The film occasionally drags, but is never really boring, and the writing stays relatively strong and focused Despite what others may have said, the humor actually works very well, and is mostly subtle, (except for the boat chase and Pepper, and while Bond uses gadgets, he uses his wits more than you may think to escape situations. Overall this is actually a very good Bond film, and action film in general, and it is one of Moore's best, and actually one of the series' best too.

In fact it did a lot worse than Meyer's subsequent effort Motor Psycho. The latter was essentially a more traditional exploitation flick in which a gang of thugs go around causing violence. The chief difference between this movie and Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! was that in the latter the villains were a gang of girls. It seems audiences in 1965 weren't ready for the kind of dangerous women that Meyer unleashed; women as amoral and violent as traditional male villains. Nowadays, there will be very few people indeed who consider Motor Psycho the better film, while Faster Pussycat is not only regarded by many as Meyer's best film but also one of the very best exploitation films ever made. The reason it didn't connect at the time was really because it was too far ahead of the game.For a film made in the mid-60's Faster Pussycat has a very modern feel. One of the reasons for this was because of Meyer's sharp photography coupled with his precision editing. His films were very stylised and Faster Pussycat is a great example. His camera-work is always consummate and great looking, while the three lead women are consistently well shot &#x96; Meyer always ensures that they look fantastic. These women are of course the pussycats &#x96; go-go dancers, drag racers, killers - and a cooler gang of villains there has never been. The leader Varla is truly a one in a million. Played by the indescribably sensational Tura Satana, she is clad entirely in black and goes around shouting lines of great dialogue at whoever comes within distance. Has there ever been a temptress as cool and dangerous as Varla in cinema ever since? No, there certainly has not. Then there is Billie played by Lori Williams who is the loose cannon of the group. On the surface she seems the least threatening of the trio but she is under no one's thumb and Williams is extremely seductive. Completing the trio is Rosie played by the one and only Haji. Personally, she is my favourite of the three. She has the most magnificent over-the-top (Latino?) accent and gestures I have ever seen. Needless to say, all three pussycats are glorious. The male characters are much less interesting &#x96; how could they not be? &#x96; but still Meyer regular Stuart Lancaster is once again very good in the role as a wheelchair-bound nasty misogynist, while it would be remiss not to mention that he has a simple minded son who is known simply as The Vegetable.But Faster Pussycat is not all about the visuals. The script by Jack Moran is extremely memorable and full of brilliant one-liners. Varla in particular spits out this dialogue with some verve. It remains a very amusing film because of the sheer funniness of the script. The movie even begins with a voice-over that starts with the genius line 'welcome to violence!' We are subsequently warned of a new type of woman, a dangerous female who will kill without warning. All of this is accompanied by a black screen with audio distortion lines. Directly after this we are in a go-go club where we are immediately introduced to the pussycats. And we are off, driving through the desert along with the ultra-cool theme tune by The Bostweeds. It's one of the greatest openings to any film in my personal opinion.Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! is a film full of entertainment from start to finish.

The key thing is that it's more than a mere war movie; as an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's book, Heart of Darkness, the film is a dark and primal exploration of the savagery of the human heart, and a journey into insanity.Set in the Vietnam war, there are just a few combat scenes in Apocalypse Now. The beach attack in the beginning half of the film is probably the most impressive action scene, for it is well-staged and thrilling. The rest of the film, however, settles into a slower, moodier, and more trance-like pacing. Action and violence occurs sporadically, but most of the film plays out like a mesmerizing nightmare. Much like a nightmare, there are gnarly and scary things to see, but it's hard to turn away from it.Therein lies the film's greatest strength its ability to convey horror and insanity within its narrative. The story itself is all about the journey into the heart of darkness, figuratively and literally. As the characters traverse deeper into enemy territory, civilization gradually breaks down, until they reach a savage core. Thus, things become crazier, more insane, and more brutal, right up to the end. By the time you reach the end, strong themes emerge concerning savagery, the darkness of the human spirit, and morality. As a war movie, the film also harps a lot on the futility and insanity of war.Even on the surface level, the story is pretty solid. The plot is pretty random, but it follows the structure of Joseph Conrad's novel pretty closely, and uses a lot of the same characters. The film treats the story and characters with diligent respect; even though it adapts a lot from the original book, it makes things fit into the Vietnam setting really well, and makes them stand out in their own unique ways. Whether you look at it as an adaptation or just another war movie, it works.The filmmakers went through Hell and back to make this movie. The actual shooting went on sixteen months and went well over-budget, and in all that time, there were horrendous problems. Martin Sheen nearly died from a heart attack during filming. That scene in the beginning when he punches a mirror is not acting, and that was real blood on his hands. Marlon Brando arrived on the set totally unprepared for his role, causing even more grief. Other actors succumbed to substance abuse. Director Francis Ford Coppola lost a ton of weight during this project; later, he had an affair, which strained things even further. A typhoon destroyed some of the sets, delaying the production even further. The helicopters, which were on loan from the Filipino government, had to be withdrawn at certain times (even in the middle of shooting) to fight rebels in the area. The sheer amount of stress is palpable on-screen, and helps make it feel more real.The film has splendid photography and editing. Acting is quite decent from the whole cast, and is admirable considering all they went through. Writing is good. This production uses a plethora of very real-looking sets, props, costumes, and locales. A lot of scenes are specifically staged to reflect actual iconic events of the Vietnam war, for decent effect. Music is wild the actual score is really funky, but the use of the Doors music and Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries is iconic.There are at least two versions of this film available. The theatrical cut is a good, trim version that runs for two-and-a-half hours. The Redux edition adds on another 49 minutes a massive wealth of new scenes, which slows things down a bit, but offers a lot more to the story and themes. There are a few scenes in the Redux version I didn't care for, but it is well worth seeing at least once. An alternate end-credits sequence was filmed (a fairly awesome scene where everything blows up), but never used for any of the film's cuts; it can be seen as a DVD or Blu-Ray special feature only.Apocalypse Now is a sobering and mesmerizing exploration into the dark pit of mankind's primal soul.

Apocalypse Now is Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam War epic that tells the story of Captain Willard on a mission to terminate Col. Kurtz command as he has become rogue and conducting operations with the locals. This film does not focus on the exciting action part of the war but rather what the war does to a person. The film does have moments of epic destruction but it supports the point that Coppola is trying to make. To truly enjoy this film, you must come in with the right mindset or this film would be seen as a big disappointment.The film is based on a novel by Joseph Conrad titled Heart of Darkness and was written for the screen by Francis Ford Coppola and John Milius. Coppola and Milius has taken Conrad's story and placed it within the Vietnam War which I thought worked. Coppola and Milius has created a screenplay that gives us a look on the horrors of war whether it's on a grand scale, like the killing of civilians, or on a personal level, Willard in his hotel room. Willard is escorted to Kurtz by a boat crew who at the start seems like normal guys in the war, just having fun and doing what they are supposed to do, but as they go further and further down the river they start to lose themselves and become more primal. The writers have not only added a straightforward story of a mission but also the disintegration of one's super-ego and has been stripped down to just the id. When they have gone past the last outpost, where every soldier seems to have gone mad, they found Kurtz. This is the point where things become less easy to tolerate as I had to watch this film at least 4 times to at least get a grasp of the point. Is Kurtz more evil or insane than any of the other soldiers napalming villages? It's really interesting how Coppola and Milius tackled this and makes us think about morality and whether or not our own super-ego is really more wiser than our own instinct.The 1970's is a great decade for him, as all of his directorial efforts in that period were nominated for Best Picture and two of which won the Palme d'Or at Cannes. Apocalypse Now is definitely his most ambitious film as the first 3 quarters of the film just shows where most of his budget went. The napalm, ordered by Col. Kilgore, on that village was a fantastic scene and knowing that back then post production effects couldn't do something like that made the scene all the more impressive. Though this film has it's epic moments, it's the intimate scenes in the boat or at Kurtz's compound where I felt this film really shined. Too bad Coppola did not find the same acclaim in his future films, maybe except The Godfather Part 3.The film was photographed by Vittorio Storaro who also did The Last Emperor, and his efforts here is just as important as Coppola's contributions as he is responsible for making the scenes look spectacular. Storaro's best captured moments in the film were at the big time war sequences, and as the film progresses it becomes more darker and moody. On daytime scenes, the image gives off a sunrise or sunset kind of feel to it which I think worked for the film. I like the way Brando was captured, consumed by the darkness making it feel artful.Carmine Coppola is the composer for this film. The film's score sounds like something that came off either from A Clockwork Orange or The Shining, using some sort of synthesizer to manipulate the sound in order to create that tension in the track. I don't think it was that much of a standout but it does work. What did standout was the soundtrack, they come in full force. Moments like the helicopter scenes using Ride of the Valkyries or that scene on the boat where The Rolling Stone's 'I Can't Get No Satisfaction was playing through Clean's radio. Coppola's score is more present as they go down the river and pop songs that were found in the first track were gone. Also this film is loud, this was one of the first films to ever have a 5.1 mix and the results are booming.The acting is on this film is great. I especially like the subtle things that are found on the boat ride that makes the scene just a little more realistic and gives a little more personality to the characters. Willard, for the most part, doesn't try to outshine anybody but rather just keeping it simple. There is a scene though in his hotel room where you can really feel the damage of Willard and it's one of the moments that really stand out in Sheen's acting. I'm not even sure he was acting because he was an alcoholic then. Brando didn't wow me like he did in The Godfather but he was poetic and artful in his acting. He was consumed in Darkness for the most of the film so most of his acting came from his facial expression. I preferred him here than he was in The Godfather. Dennis Hopper as the photojournalist was the one where I never really understood because it felt like his lines were improvised and was talking in code, but it was still somewhat relevant to the plot.This film is something that grew on me with multiple viewings. This is up there with my Coppola favorites and at par with The Conversation, which I think is his best work. This film is deep and doesn't try to wow you but rather have you thinking. Just try to make sure you watch this with the right mindset to truly enjoy this film.

I'm not even sure he was acting because he was an alcoholic then. Brando didn't wow me like he did in The Godfather but he was poetic and artful in his acting. He was consumed in Darkness for the most of the film so most of his acting came from his facial expression. I preferred him here than he was in The Godfather. Dennis Hopper as the photojournalist was the one where I never really understood because it felt like his lines were improvised and was talking in code, but it was still somewhat relevant to the plot.This film is something that grew on me with multiple viewings. This is up there with my Coppola favorites and at par with The Conversation, which I think is his best work. This film is deep and doesn't try to wow you but rather have you thinking. Just try to make sure you watch this with the right mindset to truly enjoy this film.

Whilst I can understand this not being everyones taste it certainly appealed to the artist in me with its combination of film and theater, and of course a story line about a bunch of struggling bohemian artists trying to make it big. The story line consists of Christian (Ewan McGregor) moving to Paris to pursue his obsession with love and the bohemian lifestyle, and much to his surprise being dragged into writing a play with a bunch of struggling artists. On his first visit to the Moulin Rouge he meets Satine (Nicole Kidman) and sparks fly! The 2 actors have a magical on stage connection that makes the entire movie seem so real, they really make you believe they are madly in love, I sometimes felt like I was inside the story line rather than just watching it, its so easy to get lost in! As is normal with Luhrman the movie is quite fast paced, brightly coloured, the sets are surreal and the acting is highly over the top, all of it making you feel as if you are at the Theatre. A lot of people don't like the fact that original songs weren't written for it but I absolutely loved the song choices, they were quite familiar which allows you to sing along on your first viewing of the film! With such a fast paced, bright, trippy movie we expect a happy ending were the lovers get married and live happily ever after, sadly this isn't so, throughout the film you will notice it get gradually darker and darker, and the ending hit me so hard that I was crying for an hour afterwords! This film is definitely worth a watch, and I know I will watch it again and again and again! If you like art and excitement and creativity, watch it.

JJ's Verdict Jim Carrey, at his rubber-faced best (or worst if you hate it, like me), manages to create a sweet and loving film that would actually be better off without him. The majority of his films are just vehicles for him with little plot, but this role wasn't written for him and actually has a good plot which Carrey unfortunately distracts you from.Liar Liar focuses on Carrey's Fletcher Redde, a fast-talking and outgoing lawyer who is ready to lie to win his case as quick as a flash. So when he lets down his 5- year-old son (Justin Cooper) yet again, making many lies in the process, the boy makes a birthday wish to prevent his dad from lying for a whole day. This wish comes true without any explanation and becomes problematic for Fletcher as he cannot lie during a case where the woman he is defending is certainly in the wrong. It is kind of ironic for Fletcher that although some aspects of his life go horribly wrong, his relationship with his son and wife improves drastically. Carrey, although he puts a huge amount of effort into the film, is just not funny when he goes into his ridiculous and over-the-top physical humour mode. Although it works when he is playing around with his son, it is just not a normal thing someone would do. He flaps his arms like crazy and pulls off almost impossible facial expressions but I'm afraid he just isn't funny. In fact the only time he is funny, is a scene where he isn't jumping around everywhere but just talking. I wish he would do more of it because he is actually a very funny guy which shows off in the worryingly hilarious credits (worrying because it is probably the best part of the film).Liar Liar is a loving and actually quite cute film, which also gives us some decently entertaining court scenes.

Not all filmgoers, especially the mainstream audience would be all too pleased about that.Anderson's film has a very difficult plot to describe. It has all these stories that are interwoven and how each character is somehow related to the other characters. It's a passionate story that talks about the meaning of life and the ups and downs of life.

'Alien' was very suspenseful, and very well done for what it is, so it was really good. I watched it as a sci-fi thriller movie. This was a very good sci-fi thriller movie. It was suspenseful, interesting, and had cool images. That's what a sci-fi thriller is supposed to have in it. There was even some action, and things I've seen once before. That's because I saw 'Prometheus' before this. I liked this as well as I liked 'Prometheus'. The technology difference probably makes this a better movie. The scenery for this was great, and this movie was a very good idea. 'Alien' was very, very enjoyable almost all the way through. I thought the beginning was kind of boring, but still a bit interesting, because it was such a good idea.The movie did have very little time on the planet, but in the time that the scenery was beautiful and worked well for this very strange planet. The alien ship was also worked on very hard for a long time and the look of it worked well for an alien ship, but mostly because we would have no knowledge of what an alien ship would really look like, so the architects of it could be creative. They did really well in this one, because it didn't have the architecture of what we'd THINK the ship would look like. There were very strange things that didn't really fit in to an architecture of a ship that made sense because again, it's an alien ship. I really thought that worked well for it. That was very cool.The movie's scenery and architecture was really cool, but I saw this movie to see a bunch of people on a ship getting killed by a huge alien, and it delivers that well. There was a really suspenseful, intense, awesome, good and long part that gives us what we came for. The part was long enough to give us what we wanted, but not too long that it got boring and stopped being interesting. This was mostly because of what all was happening. It was able to be suspenseful enough that it kept it's solidness and was still able to be just as intense. It was kind of like when a horror movie is scary enough that it can repeat several times and you're focused on being scared, so it doesn't get old. It was like that, but only with being suspenseful instead of being scary. Anyway, that part was incredible and kept me guessing and on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was, of course, the best part of the movie.For most of the movie, it was very interesting, because again, the story line was great. This part of the movie was enjoyable and very strange. The story was able to stay good because of the events that happened leading up to the big part of the movie I talked about in the previous paragraph. Several strange things that almost didn't belong there (like in the architecture of the ship) were there, but they worked. This part was a little boring, but it took a while to get boring, because so much happened here. Right behind the part in the previous paragraph was a little interesting, but boring. It was able to stay enjoyable for that long. One or two major story events happened then, which were actually intense (so they were enjoyable). Those were the best parts of the lead-up to the big part of the movie.The ending of the movie had some good, intense action that was very enjoyable. In this part there weren't odd things that you wouldn't think about being there, but it was very enjoyable; but sadly, the lack of those things made the end get a little boring. I still liked it, though.I recommend this movie to anyone who's thinking about seeing it. It's a little boring in some parts, but it has beautiful scenery, amazing architecture, intense, suspenseful sci-fi thriller sequences, and some fun action.

","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"15 July 2013","score":"","review":" As it being an old movie, 'Alien' was meant to be a horror movie, but it wasn't scary. 'Alien' was very suspenseful, and very well done for what it is, so it was really good. I watched it as a sci-fi thriller movie. This was a very good sci-fi thriller movie. It was suspenseful, interesting, and had cool images. That's what a sci-fi thriller is supposed to have in it. There was even some action, and things I've seen once before. That's because I saw 'Prometheus' before this. I liked this as well as I liked 'Prometheus'. The technology difference probably makes this a better movie. The scenery for this was great, and this movie was a very good idea. 'Alien' was very, very enjoyable almost all the way through. I thought the beginning was kind of boring, but still a bit interesting, because it was such a good idea.The movie did have very little time on the planet, but in the time that the scenery was beautiful and worked well for this very strange planet. The alien ship was also worked on very hard for a long time and the look of it worked well for an alien ship, but mostly because we would have no knowledge of what an alien ship would really look like, so the architects of it could be creative. They did really well in this one, because it didn't have the architecture of what we'd THINK the ship would look like. There were very strange things that didn't really fit in to an architecture of a ship that made sense because again, it's an alien ship. I really thought that worked well for it. That was very cool.The movie's scenery and architecture was really cool, but I saw this movie to see a bunch of people on a ship getting killed by a huge alien, and it delivers that well. There was a really suspenseful, intense, awesome, good and long part that gives us what we came for. The part was long enough to give us what we wanted, but not too long that it got boring and stopped being interesting. This was mostly because of what all was happening. It was able to be suspenseful enough that it kept it's solidness and was still able to be just as intense. It was kind of like when a horror movie is scary enough that it can repeat several times and you're focused on being scared, so it doesn't get old. It was like that, but only with being suspenseful instead of being scary. Anyway, that part was incredible and kept me guessing and on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was, of course, the best part of the movie.For most of the movie, it was very interesting, because again, the story line was great. This part of the movie was enjoyable and very strange. The story was able to stay good because of the events that happened leading up to the big part of the movie I talked about in the previous paragraph. Several strange things that almost didn't belong there (like in the architecture of the ship) were there, but they worked. This part was a little boring, but it took a while to get boring, because so much happened here. Right behind the part in the previous paragraph was a little interesting, but boring. It was able to stay enjoyable for that long. One or two major story events happened then, which were actually intense (so they were enjoyable). Those were the best parts of the lead-up to the big part of the movie.The ending of the movie had some good, intense action that was very enjoyable. In this part there weren't odd things that you wouldn't think about being there, but it was very enjoyable; but sadly, the lack of those things made the end get a little boring. I still liked it, though.I recommend this movie to anyone who's thinking about seeing it. It's a little boring in some parts, but it has beautiful scenery, amazing architecture, intense, suspenseful sci-fi thriller sequences, and some fun action. The movie was a little bit longer than I think it should have been though. Anyway, the 8\/10 rating means the movie is really good.
