If you are familiar with The Big Sleep with Bogart and crew, you might actually get a sense of what this movie is trying to do. Not only does the plot begin in a similar way, with a rich family saying one of their members (the son) is missing and with the daughter being a steamy and somewhat unreliable secondary force (played by Nastassja Kinski), but then the rest of the movie proceeds to get increasingly confusing.In The Big Sleep this is almost a positive thing, making it fast, visual, and experiential (meaning you get sucked into the world and can't stop looking and trying to keep up). Here, in The Lost Son, it isn't what anyone would call fast, which hurts it because the complexity builds and the suspicions fester with lots of lulls, either whole short scenes that don't seem quite necessary or with an editing that makes every little cut one or two seconds too long. Which adds up to a kind of pace some people might like, a loitering and inhabiting this strange little nether world the movie creates. But for me it just made me fuzz out a little.The leading detective, Xavier Lombard, is played by the really compelling French actor, Daniel Auteuil. He carries the movie even through it's pauses. Besides Kinski, whose role is small (and thankfully, really--she doesn't really act so much as say her lines), there is a second male lead, the Irish actor Ciaran Hinds, who is quite good. (He had a terrific role in the peculiar and enjoyable Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day.) And the filming is rather nice, with a huge range of scenes and moods, held together not only by the camera-work, but the solid directing by Chris Menges.There will be an odd feel to this film for some American viewers, because it's an increasingly common hybrid of French and British filmmaking--language, crew, cast, and locations all spread out from one side of the Channel to the other. It's nicely European, but less of that familiar British film that many people know (or know without knowing they know it, looking vaguely like Hollywood). In short, this has a slightly fresh look. It does not however feel as new or odd or wonderful as some of the detective crime films coming out of, say, Scandinavia, among the European types.This matters only in that half of the film is its atmosphere. The plot and some of the core acting could use a bolstering and maybe even a sense of necessity at times (the movie just keeps going through its attractive paces), but in all, it might even be a film you'd enjoy more the second time.

It has been exhibited both as a theatrical release and as a TV miniseries, and in several different home video versions of various running times.Das Boot is an adaption of the German novel of the same name by Lothar- Günther Buchheim. Set during World War II, the film tells the fictional story of U-96 and its crew. It depicts both the excitement of battle and the tedium of the fruitless hunt, and shows the men serving aboard U- boats as ordinary individuals with a desire to do their best for their comrades and their country. The screenplay used an amalgamation of exploits from the real U-96, a Type VIIC-class U-boat commanded by Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock, one of Germany's top U-boat tonnage aces during the war.Das Boot is one of the most gripping and authentic war movies ever made. Based on an autobiographical novel by German World War II photographer Lothar-Guenther Buchheim, the film follows the lives of a fearless U- Boat captain and his inexperienced crew as they patrol the Atlantic and Mediterranean in search of Allied vessels, taking turns as hunter and prey. There's very little plot, so the movie's power comes from both its riveting, epic battle scenes and its details of the boring hours spent waiting for orders or signs of the enemy. With the exception of one staunch Hitler Youth lieutenant, none of the crew is particularly loyal to the Nazis, and some are openly hostile toward their Fuhrer; this allows viewer sympathy with the men as they perform their laborious, monotonous duties in cramped, filthy quarters, or await death as depth charges explode all around the sub. Prochnow is excellent as the nerves- of-steel commander, and many of the supporting actors -- all German -- are solid as well, although the characterizations border on war movie clichés (the young crewman who has left behind his pregnant girlfriend, the Chief Engineer whose wife is seriously ill). The real star, however, is cinematographer Jost Vacano, who makes the sub's grimy, claustrophobic interior come to vivid life, as his camera follows the crew through hatches, up ladders, into bunks, and under pipes, creating a palpable sense of claustrophobia while injecting it with movement. Wolfgang Petersen's direction is an exercise in pure craftsmanship.Also,Petersen's shooting style displays a breathtaking, if impersonal and faintly academic, virtuosity comparable to that of Lean or Coppola.Aside from that,takes all of the drama and suspense inherent in a submarine-based story and delivers it in a near- perfect package, establishing it as not just a terrific adrenaline rush, but one of the best movies ever made.In summary,it is one of the best war films ever.

It's a movie, not an adapted play.Two, it's inaccurate. Yes. Of course. It's a dramatized movie based on an historic figure. The truths are plenty--the boy genius, the patronage, the music scene in general. The fictions are worth noting, mainly that Salieri didn't kill Mozart (there is zero evidence of this, just chatter). Salieri didn't transcribe Mozart's final Requiem at his death bed. And Mozart's wife didn't sound like a ditzy American. Of course. Three, the operas are staged in contemporary terms, like dry ice effects. The venues are appropriate, and in fact, Mozart's time is not that far from ours, not in the larger picture.Speaking of venues, the whole city of Vienna looks terrific--because it's actually Prague. Go to Prague now and it'll have the same effect, though without the gray severity. Yes, Mozart was buried in a common grave. Yes he died too young from still uncertain causes (see Wikipedia for a full rundown of likely options). And yes, he was pretty innovative and radical.

If you hate hate opera, you might have to just marvel at the sets and crazy crowds.There isn't a bad actor here, or a bad moment, really. And the music, the music! It's wonderful. The performances, take note, are by the high water mark of Mozart performances in the 20th Century--Sir Neville Mariner leading his famed orchestra. Likewise, the opera productions are by one of the great talents of the era, Twyla Tharp. The director Milos Forman has a short resume but it's impressive, including Hair as a kind of precursor and One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest as proof of some kind of higher ability.

Ferris Bueller (Mathew Broderick) is an American Idol to all in this country. Everyone can appreciate the movie magic that is created when he takes of in the red car. The ingenuity of a moving, mechanical sleep dummy gets him started and on the right path to a truly successful day off. The plot is carefully orchestrated with Ferris Bueller (Broderick) as a wise-cracking high school senior from the fictional northern Chicago suburb of Shermer, Illinois (in reality, Lake Forest, Illinois), who decides to skip school (Lake Forest High School) for a day on the town by pretending to be sick. He convinces his nervous friend, Cameron (Ruck) to take his father's carefully restored 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California out for a spin, although Cameron's father has so little trust in him that he has memorized the car's mileage. Ferris makes the promise to erase any miles they put on the car by running the car in reverse when they return. Masquerading as her father, Ferris springs his junior girlfriend Sloane (Sara) from school on the premise that her grandmother has died. this is a truly remarkable film. This movie simply cannot be subjected to being graded by the same criteria as any other movie. It is completely original. To attempt to assess the acting in this movie is just stupid and pretentious. I have yet to see a movie that stands out in my collection (which is considerably large) as does this. Whether you are looking for depth or just comedy, which i think this movie achieves with class. Aimed at a younger generation of the time, it's truly surprising how much credit this movie gives to its audience; the esoteric conversations, the humor-in-dialogue-form, and the lack of crudeness is significantly above meant-for-the-average. This movie delivers any message a viewer may wish to find with class such that the movie\/characters establish(es) an almost intimate relationship with the audience which must feel flattered by the highly intelligent work of art this movie is.

Skeletor desperately needs to get his hands (or should that be bones?) on a cosmic key devised by lovable imp Gwildor (Billy Barty); said key opens dimensional doors and transports various characters good and bad to Earth, where they raise all sort of hell in their battles, and two teen lovers, Julie (a young Courteney Cox) and Kevin (Robert Duncan McNeill of 'Star Trek Voyager') get caught up in all of it, along with a flustered detective (James Tolkan). The movie is quite easy to take from start to finish, with pacing that doesn't falter, lots of colourful visuals and effects, a score by Bill Conti automatically calling to mind John Williams's work for Superman and Star Wars, and entertaining characters, although the villains definitely fare better than the heroes; Langella is commanding as Skeletor, and Meg Foster likewise delicious as Evil-Lyn. The four henchmen dispatched by skull face are an amusing bunch, especially the Beastman who looks rather like the character Alph from the futuristic action \/ exploitation flick Turkey Shoot. But for this viewer, what makes this as much fun as it is, is the ass kicking character of Detective Lubic; Tolkan is hysterical in the role.

The film is difficult to enjoy, because while it is visually stunning, its slow pace really pushes the patience of the audience. One could argue that the slow pace is necessary to really enhance the feeling of awkwardness and eeriness. Indeed, the film has been called creepy by critic Greg Harris; while I am not sure this is the proper word, it does leave the viewer feeling uneasy.Roger Ebert called it a film of haunting mystery and buried sexual hysteria and remarked that it employs two of the hallmarks of modern Australian films beautiful cinematography and stories about the chasm between settlers from Europe and the mysteries of their ancient new home.I am unclear about the buried sexual hysteria, though Ebert does go on to talk about theories of rape and murder that I think exist more in his mind than on screen. I am also unclear about his settlers from Europe idea. I will not argue the beautiful cinematography, though -- the framing is excellent, and the use of Hanging Rock's natural images (including several face-like rock structures) is well-executed. There is some confusion over how big the rock is -- does it require a trail of bread crumbs to get back or is it a five minute climb -- but this may be part of its charm.Where Ebert really nails the film, though, is when he sums it up as being free of plot, lacking any final explanation, it exists as an experience. Indeed, many of the film's shots evoke memories of paintings, such as Renoir's Luncheon of the Boating Party, and in one moment a girl is even compared with Botticelli's The Birth of Venus. The film exists, like Ebert says, as an experience free of plot... a moving, two-hour painting that we can take away from as we wish, and like or dislike as we would a classic work of art.Peter Weir's own words further suggest he was not trying to give a clear-cut narrative. We worked very hard, says Weir, at creating an hallucinatory, mesmeric rhythm, so that you lost awareness of facts, you stopped adding things up, and got into this enclosed atmosphere. We are free of time and space while watching Picnic, as we could be in 1900 or 1776 or any other time (and it is interesting to note the film takes place on Saturday, February 14, 1900 -- a date that never existed).Much more could be made of the film's themes and symbolism with the hearts, the boys, the trances and the swans... but I know of no coherent way to express these things.

Gittes is sucked into a world of scandal and mystery, where nothing is as it seems and everything is connected. Set in 1940's L.A., Chinatown takes mystery noir and turns into into a beautiful masterpiece. Surprisingly it is compared by many to the 1997 feature L.A. Confidential, who also say that they are alike. I find this difficult to believe, because Chinatown is more of a mystery noir while L.A. Confidential is more of a thriller. The performances in Chinatown are first- rate, with immensely deep performances by Jack Nicholson and Fay Dunaway. Both were nominated for their roles, and they both deserved to win. An honorable mention is John Huston as Noah Cross, a mysterious man who has more involvement then seen. It's not easy to like Jack Nicholson's character; he is snoopy and sly, and will do whatever it takes to get information. However, the viewer can easily understand him for he is sucked into this world without warning.

Gittes is sucked into a world of scandal and mystery, where nothing is as it seems and everything is connected. Set in 1940's L.A., Chinatown takes mystery noir and turns into into a beautiful masterpiece. Surprisingly it is compared by many to the 1997 feature L.A. Confidential, who also say that they are alike. I find this difficult to believe, because Chinatown is more of a mystery noir while L.A. Confidential is more of a thriller. The performances in Chinatown are first- rate, with immensely deep performances by Jack Nicholson and Fay Dunaway. Both were nominated for their roles, and they both deserved to win. An honorable mention is John Huston as Noah Cross, a mysterious man who has more involvement then seen. It's not easy to like Jack Nicholson's character; he is snoopy and sly, and will do whatever it takes to get information. However, the viewer can easily understand him for he is sucked into this world without warning.

(It should be noted that he did an outstanding job in L.A. Confidential.) I was duly impressed. As for the performances of Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson, they were first rate as well. Ben Kingsley was also at the top of his game,too. The production values were high and William Friedkin who directed both The French Connection and The Exorcist is more than able in this film. He captured effectively what we face whenever we have political dealings in the Middle East.

It might legitimately be said that the emotional content is piled on too high, at times forcibly or even exploititively, but the emotional response is still very authentic and very intense. Awakenings rejects the viewers' resistance and may move the most cynical of them. It boasts excellent performances from two stars who were still at their peak - Robert De Niro and Robin Williams; though for my own taste, I liked Williams' surprisingly subtle and mellow performance more than De Niro's intense, Oscar nominated one.The film's biggest weakness, for me, was that it failed to follow through on some of its more interesting points. A great deal of emphasis is put on the relationship between Williams' and De Niro's characters, and especially on Dr. Sayer's (Williams) personal journey, but not enough on the implications of some of the comments made throughout the film - what were the patients feeling during their long catatonic states? Were they fully aware of their environments? And more importantly - how do you deal with losing several decades of your life? Leonard (De Niro) seemed to be having an easier time than most patients in dealing with this, there are a couple of moments like him staring at the mirror or being bemused by hearing rock music for the first time, but just how unthinkably difficult these adjustments would be for him are only briefly explored through short scenes with some of the other patients. Leonard's rebellion over not being allowed to leave the hospital (a scene almost too reminiscent of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) is mostly triggered by fear of regressing to his previous state and not by the unimaginable shock of suddenly finding himself forty years older.That doesn't detract much from the emotional impact that Awakenings hold, or from the fact that it's constantly engaging and enticing. I'm not completely at ease with the ending that puts far too much emphasis on the changes Sayer went through and far too little on Lenoard's own perspective, but it makes for a good and satisfying ending, and for a nearly flawless film experience.

Then those man-apes. The sparkling eyes of that leopard. The tapirs in Africa. And it just got more cockeyed as the three or four episodes progressed. Finally, when Dave Bowman was alone in that claustrophobic pod and hurtling through a universe made up of God knows what, there was a powerful sense of his being utterly alone. The last shot -- that Star Child -- well, make of it what we will.It was all ambiguity imbued with some sort of mysticism, as if the film were trying to send us a message in some language we couldn't understand. Here, in the sequel, the ambiguity is turned to platitudinous confusion. This isn't very original. It's a rather standard science fiction movie with generic music, cross-cutting suspense, a familiarly and dramatic lighting style, arguments between crew members, mysterious messages from Bowman's spirit about something being about to happen.

Neither the Russian nor Lithgow know it, although the writers certainly did, that this Russian has a long and familiar cinematic line of descent. He's a descendant of all those Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Germans who learned to speak English in earlier movies, an English with a Southern accent or larded with expressions like beat me, Daddy, eight to the bar. Sometimes they play a ukulele.I don't think I'll give away the ending. No, I won't.

The lighting carried the director's signature all the interiors were bright and fluorescent, like a hospital operating room. The musical score was adapted from varied sources. None of the humans seemed at all emotional. An astronaut is indifferent to a birthday greeting from his parents. A man calls his daughter and speaks as if he's at a business conference. Then those man-apes. The sparkling eyes of that leopard. The tapirs in Africa. And it just got more cockeyed as the three or four episodes progressed. Finally, when Dave Bowman was alone in that claustrophobic pod and hurtling through a universe made up of God knows what, there was a powerful sense of his being utterly alone. The last shot -- that Star Child -- well, make of it what we will.It was all ambiguity imbued with some sort of mysticism, as if the film were trying to send us a message in some language we couldn't understand. Here, in the sequel, the ambiguity is turned to platitudinous confusion. This isn't very original. It's a rather standard science fiction movie with generic music, cross-cutting suspense, a familiarly and dramatic lighting style, arguments between crew members, mysterious messages from Bowman's spirit about something being about to happen. Oh, what, we ask? Something wonderful. It's full of non sequiturs that seem pointless, inexplicable. An old lady is brain dead in the hospital and we suddenly see her sitting up, smiling, a floating brush going through her hair. What this incident -- or any OTHER given incident -- has to do with the banal ending is anybody's guess.No, I wouldn't have wanted to be hired to write this story for the screen. Failure is built into it, regardless of the admirable performances. How can you improve on 2001? Well, if one awesome monolith is pregnant with significance, how about ten thousand of them? Yes, a whole sky full of monoliths, all of them meaningless.The space ship team is made up half of Americans and half of Soviets. The Soviets are at first surly and uncooperative. (This is 1984.) But one of them is a kind of nice guy with a sense of humor, capable of wise cracks, willing to learn American slang expressions. A task is a piece of pie. Lithgow corrects him, piece of cake. Later the Russian refers to something as easy as cake. Pie, says Lithgow with a smile.

Cmdr. Tom Farrell, came to be there. His story starts when he goes to a Washington political event where his old acquaintance Scott Prichard introduces him to his boss; Defense Secretary David Brice. This meeting is fairly cursory but the party isn't a total disaster; he ends up leaving with a woman, Susan Atwell, and spending the night with her. They start a relationship although he knows she is involved with another man. It turns out the other man is Brice and it isn't long before Farrell is working directly for him. Farrell continues his relationship and when Brice learns that Susan is seeing another man he becomes jealous and in the scuffle that follows Susan falls over the balcony is killed. Brice is ready to go to the police but Prichard thinks he knows away around the problem; what if the 'other man' was the rumoured Soviet spy known as 'Yuri'. Farrell is brought in to head the investigation; not an easy job when he knows that ultimately he will be exposed and likely killed... he will have to find proof against the real killer first.This film opened rather slowly; setting up Farrell's relationship with Sarah and showing some Washington politics meant that the real drama that started with Sarah's death didn't begin for three quarters of an hour. Once we were into the investigation things got much better though; even though the action is fairly limited it is pretty tense. Kevin Costner does a pretty good job as Farrell although there wasn't much chemistry between him and Sean Young who played Sarah. The best performance came from Will Patton who was great as Scott Prichard; a truly unpleasant character who will stop at nothing to protect his boss. There are certain aspects of the film that seem dated and I don't mean the eighties hairdos and technology; much of the music seems like it comes from a particularly cliché TV movie... saxophone music for the fairly tame sex scenes! There is a decent twist at the end but I won't spoil it here!

As long as they have some sort of entertainment, food and great and violent shows they were happy yet controlled, without defying their government. I guess we can say that about now the period in which we live, except for some differences here and there, there's some escapes to this control, you don't need to be restricted to the brainless entertainment, after all there's real art to clear and free our weary minds so filled with information. In the future the Bread and Circus will be the Rollerball, a game played by this updated version of gladiators who walk on rollerskaters and motorcycles killing each other to catch a ball, score goals on a game that always keeps changing rules, delight their audiences in order to please the new form of government of the future, the Corporations (who are we kidding, they are the current governments of now, the difference is that they use politicians to do their dirty work). The Corporations mission is to control people and to say to them that every kind of individual force is useless, and only the group effort is valuable. The dystopic yet somewhat closer to the truth Rollerball not only present such ideas but also an opposition to that when a Rollerball player, the fearless and handy Jonathan (James Caan), is forced to retire from the game because of unknown reasons to him, but clearly known to us. Bartholomew, the Chairman of the Corporations (brilliantly played by John Houseman) knows that this man is a threat to his policy, that player is too famous, he's cheered by the crowd who adores his moves while playing as leader of the team and winning all the time. The individual must be weaker than the society, weaker than the group therefore Jonathan must be removed. However, the player wants to know why he's getting retired, challenging everything and everyone to stay in the game at the same time he gets some truth of why things are the way they are. Once in a while a dystopic film or book comes to shock us at the same time they reveal some painful truths about our condition as human beings. Fahrenheit 451, 1984, V for Vendetta and Brazil are notable and perfect dystopic examples and they really work their ideals with futuristic societies that appear to be perfect but with distorted values. Some alienated minds think it can only happen in the movies without noticing that they do happen in real life as well. This science-fiction made in 1975 almost got a good result. Its idea of corporations controlling people through a dangerous game is interesting when you hear about it but its presentation is weak, very plain and utterly lifeless when you watch this movie. I wanted more answers about what kind of corporation runs the world and more reasons on the way they act. Opening the discussion of its adventure\/thriller aspects this is even weaker than the serious ideas. The movie never creates tension enough in putting Jonathan in danger, we've only see the Chairman making threats to the player but that's it. The only credible thing about the 2002 remake (which is one of the worst movies of all time) is this fact in which the hero gets kidnapped, suffers a little for not paying attention to the threats. Not to mention that it breaks the fundamental rule of dystopic films it features an happy ending (or something very close to that) that looks so inconclusive and ridiculous that is beyond belief. No lesson is learned here when the hero is the last man standing and no visible change is done. The game will go on? Who knows? Painfully dated and boring to its chorus, the good things about Rollerball are some of the game sequences, perfectly edited altogether, fast, violent and a little bit vibrant (the last game being the best) and John Houseman's performance as the villain, an eminent character that dominates everything and everyone. Norman Jewison's film is better than John McTiernan's remake because it tries to say something meaningful about societies instead of being just an action flick with frantic Rollerball sequences. Both films are tied as being good ideas turned into weaker films. Mistakes can be easily corrected on another version maybe to come, I don't know, in the year of 2120.
