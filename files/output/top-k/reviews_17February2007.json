Sonja is his wife who suspects Leon is having an affair but doesn't know. The sessions she spends with psychiatrist Valerie Somers at least give her an outlet. Valerie though is having her own problems with her partner John, distant and unloving since the death of their daughter. Valerie also has a patient who seems particularly aggressive towards her concerning an affair he is having. The lives of all these people touch slightly but a missing person will see them collide.I had never heard of this film when it came on the television recently but the good reviews were enough for me to have a look. Initially it had me expecting some sort of murder mystery but the material soon suggests that it will be more of a character piece and it gradually starts to become a Short Cuts type of film albeit with a more specific narrative to it. To some this will be a source of frustration because, for the first half of the film it means that we are unsure where we are meant to be going; it does a good job of developing the characters but I did wonder for what reason or direction. In the second half of the film it does introduce a narrative direction but by this point it does feel secondary to the stories of the characters that had been built up by this point.It doesn't totally hang together though because the first half feels a bit aimless, while the second half feels like the mystery is butting into the characters. That said though it is still interesting for what it does as the characters are well drawn and convincing with the theme of communication (or lack of it) common across their lives and relationships. It isn't as clever as it thinks it is though (the use of the Lantana plant is not that good a metaphor) and as a result sometimes the very slow pace can be off-putting, with scenes drifting then vaguely fading out. The characters are interesting enough and strong enough to just about keep the interest but again I understand why some viewers bail out of it &#150; there isn't enough here to fill the time when it delivers it so slowly. The cast help fill it out though as they respond to the characters and the inner feelings there are asked to deliver without a lot of words. LaPaglia, Armstrong, Hershey, Rush and Blake all work well together and individually.An interesting film then that works off the back of engaging characters and relationships. Not the masterpiece that some claim though because it is not as complex nor as clever as it would like to think it is and I can understand why some viewers are left cold by it.

At first it seems a clear cut case for Powell to solve with the only matter being how long it will take for the man calling himself Prot to come out of it. However some things cannot be easily explained and somehow parts of his story makes sense. With the deadline for Prot's return to the planet K-PAX approaching, Powell tries to get to the bottom of this man, unsure of what will happen when the deadline hits.The vaguely interesting premise drew me to this film and I did hope that it would be engaging as such. The opening sort of sums up the spirit of the film in the way it isn't clear whether Prot came in the light or just seen in the light. This was necessary for the mystery element of the story but sadly the film tries to have its cake and eat it &#150; keeping the mystery throughout while also winking at the audience to tell them whatever it is they want to hear. This does mean that the audience will all mostly get something they want but that nobody will get everything. So sci-fi interests will be served by Prot proving complex gravitational forces while others will be touched by the life messages delivered. This just about works until at some points it needs to clear up a bit and generally at these points the film tends to lapse into sentimentality and vagueness. It is annoying when it does so and it can be seen all through the film right up to Prot's slight smirk in the last shot.The cast do try reasonably hard despite this material. Spacey is a bit too wooden and he doesn't really help the film deliver this sense of mystery and mental complexity &#150; from his performance he seems sure that he is an alien, end of story. With this one-note performance he does what the film deserves but doesn't make it better (which he can do to a film). Bridges reverses his Starman role and does well enough. He delivers mixed feelings and is more interesting as a result. The starry support is impressive but generally they don't have a lot to do even if the presence of McCormack, Woodard and others is good. Fans of the Wire will welcome Gerety but lament Peters not being given more as he is a very good actor.Overall then a so-so film. It has enough to be of interest to a good range of viewers but it doesn't do that well with it and floats into vagueness or sentimentality regularly.

The problem with this movie is that not one character was endearing. Emotions ran high on occasion among the characters playing their parts, but these displays fell on neutral hearts since the viewer could not connect and feel empathy for any of the characters. At times, I became irritatingly aware that the orchestral background music sounded just like Spielberg's other blockbusters. And his overused techniques for highlighting dramatic moments(in this case anti-dramatic) were painful to watch. Blockbuster, mass audience appeal went into every gimmick he employed.Also, the intended ideal age group to see this movie remains a mystery. Certainly, it was a children's movie, but it was too sophisticated and overdone for children to enjoy. At the same time, it was too boring and nonsensical for adults to bear. Spielberg was likely shooting for a mass audience, but he ended up getting none with this stinker.I thought of other children fantasy movies that did work, such as The Wizard of Oz. It was not nearly as sophisticated in cinematography, sets and storyline, but it worked because all the characters were endearing, especially Dorothy. Even the Wicked Witch had a certain charm. So even though it was abundantly clear that Oz was a complete fantasy, like Hook, it managed to capture the human heart and mind with lovable characters and the simple theme - I want to go home because there's no place like home.I must give credit to Hoffman for his portrayal of Hook.

They focus on the telly and quiet while he gets excited about history and learning. His world changes totally when he wakes to find four men have come out of his wardrobe. They start pushing one of his walls away and, when a powerful force comes out after them, Kevin flees with them. He learns the time are time travellers who have stolen a map of the holes in the galaxy from their former employer, The Supreme Being.Far from being a perfect film, Time Bandits is still a wonderfully fun fantasy for the family (although perhaps not younger children) which is also notable for not really having dated at all in its 25 years. The plot starts from nowhere and jumps around in various adventures in different times (real and fantasy) with a vague plot to hold it together. The narrative flows well in some regards but it is hard not to notice that at times it is very much like a collection of ideas and sketches rather than a strong plot. What keeps the flow though is the sense of fun and imagination that runs through it &#150; things that I think owe a lot to Gilliam's roles as director and co-writer. He fills the film with a consistent sense of wonder which is well propped up by many great shots and atmospheric scenes. It does well to mix comedy with the more serious fantasy stuff and does provide something that children and adults will like (although both will occasionally feel the effects of the film being a bit piecemeal).The principle cast are pretty enjoyable with the bandits themselves being a fun ragtag of Baker, Rappaport, Edmonds, Dixon, Purvis and Ross. Far from being a modern annoying brat actor, Warnock is actually really good and he holds the essential English-ness of the film throughout. Of course, given the fragmented nature of the film means that a lot rest on the cameos which include nice turns from Palin, a wonderfully polite Cleese and solid characters from Holm, Connery, Duvall, Warner, Broadbent and others all giving good performances in their respective roles.Overall then an enjoyable family fantasy that has all the strengths and weaknesses that you should expect from Gilliam. Structure wise it is a bit all over the place and does occasionally feel like a collection of separate ideas and sketches it does have a great sense of fun and wonder about it.

The plot starts from nowhere and jumps around in various adventures in different times (real and fantasy) with a vague plot to hold it together.

He fills the film with a consistent sense of wonder which is well propped up by many great shots and atmospheric scenes. It does well to mix comedy with the more serious fantasy stuff and does provide something that children and adults will like (although both will occasionally feel the effects of the film being a bit piecemeal).The principle cast are pretty enjoyable with the bandits themselves being a fun ragtag of Baker, Rappaport, Edmonds, Dixon, Purvis and Ross. Far from being a modern annoying brat actor, Warnock is actually really good and he holds the essential English-ness of the film throughout. Of course, given the fragmented nature of the film means that a lot rest on the cameos which include nice turns from Palin, a wonderfully polite Cleese and solid characters from Holm, Connery, Duvall, Warner, Broadbent and others all giving good performances in their respective roles.Overall then an enjoyable family fantasy that has all the strengths and weaknesses that you should expect from Gilliam. Structure wise it is a bit all over the place and does occasionally feel like a collection of separate ideas and sketches it does have a great sense of fun and wonder about it.

Marlowe obliges but returns to his home to find the police waiting for him with stories of Terry murdering his wife and Marlowe being an accessory. Three days later he is released from a holding cell whereupon he learns the news of his friend's suicide and all charges are dropped. Determined to get to the bottom of this open and shut case, Marlowe finds himself involved in the stormy marriage of Roger and Eileen Wade and the criminal activities of Marty Augustine.Hailed as a classic, this film is actually a bit of hard work crossed with cool style in a plot that gets somewhere but seems to take a long time and a million back roads to get there. It won't be to everyone's tastes as a result because, even though I quite liked it, I must confess that the narrative is hard to follow and hard to particularly care much about. The wit of it is watching Marlowe updated &#150; a device that will annoy as many as it pleases. In Gould's laidback and shabby detective we have the opposite of the tough and snappy detectives of the genre, but it sits well within the modern setting of the modern generation (as was) with its hedonism and fads. This is interesting but not the same as a good detective story, which sadly this isn't. If you're not won over by the overall approach then it is unlikely that you will find a lot more to fill the time.Altman's direction is focused on the style and, although he is fairly respectful to the material in regards what happens, he doesn't go out of his way to make it engaging. Gould fits the role well and enjoys his character. I would have liked more of the complexity underneath to come through to contrast with this surface. He is the film but he is well supported by a hammy show from Sterling and solid turns from Rydell, Pallandt, Gibson and Bouton.Overall then a difficult film to really like. It has enough of its own style to be interesting but not enough of a hook in the narrative to please a mass audience. Altman's hands are all over the film and I understand why some viewers don't like it for that reason. Not one for those looking for a gripping detective story, but still interesting.

Michael Baldwin) manages to convince Reggie, (Reggie Bannister) that his dead brother Jody, (Bill Thornbury) has come back to warn him about The Tall Man, (Angus Scrimm) and his nefarious plans for them before being kidnapped by The Tall Man. Traveling to a deserted town to find out, Reggie meets young Tim, (Kevin Connors) and the two decide to team up for a while. While checking a possible deserted town, they find Rocky, (Gloria Lynne Henry) also on the same mission and reluctantly decides to join them. Guided by Jody's spirit, they are able to reclaim Mike from The Tall Man's grasp, luring the group into a final showdown for the fate of mankind.The Good News A rather decent addition to an underrated series, this here has some really good moments. One of the film's best factors is that it does some much-needed exposition on the series. Finally giving the secret behind the Silver Spheres is a nice touch, and their revelation is quite spooky and really chilling. It also blends in with what had been giving so far and is nicely appreciated. The true story of The Tall Man is also given here, and is a really neat twist to the story. While not exactly clever, it does have an aura of being able to be convincing in the series, and that is the most important thing that can be done with it. With Reggie now at the forefront of the series, the comedy is now increased, and some classic one-liners are evident throughout. The physical stuff is subdued, leaving the mostly on-the-mark jokes to come out, and comes across nicely. There's also no shortage of gore here, including the still-messy head-drilling-silver-sphere sequence that still unleashes a gallon of blood, as well as some exploding body parts, a neat sliced throat, an ax in the head, a decapitation and a whole slew of gunshots cutting bodies up, not including the un-fatal wounds inflicted that are spread throughout. There's also no shortage of action in here, including the customary hearse chase that ends in a big crash and fireball, which is one of the greatest ones done, and a spectacular showdown in the mausoleum at the end. Taking place in an incredibly chilling Gothic mausoleum, with long, empty corridors, one-off rooms and plenty of equipment inside, this is a great showdown that pales slightly compared to the masterpiece one at the end of the second one but is still noteworthy on it's own. This here is the film's highlight sequence, and is no surprise to come at the end when everything that had been built up to it. Filled with inventive fight techniques, some really clever chases and a non-stop pace, this here is a really glorious ending that sends it out on an appropriate high-point. The Tall Man is at his most creepy here, finally being able to do something constructive to his evil personality and he even has a really creepy scene, being lit by a suddenly-changing light during a chase down a hallway that only shows his outline in the darkness. With a fun, workman-like pace and a couple of neat throwbacks to the other entries, this here is a pleasantly-entertaining entry.The Bad News Quite frankly, this film doesn't have a whole lot of problems, but they are pretty big ones. This one here doesn't make a lot of sense, despite answering several questions about the series. It's nice that it did, but there is still way too much happening here that doesn't seem to be explainable. The gateway sequence, which in the first one is shown sting the hands, now is able to lock it closed. There is still no explanation for what's the actual plan of The Tall Man's attack of where he came from, and these are perfect questions to answer this deep into the series. They prevent it from being a stand-alone film like the first two, which could be enjoyed despite not having seen the other, and this one needs the others to make sense. There's also a couple of unnecessary sequences in here, most noticeably the orphanage scene, that served nothing to the series and don't seem to have any reason to be there. These aside, this is a really good overall entry.The Final Verdict While not as clever or as scary as the first two, this is still a solid, enjoyable entry in a very under-appreciated series. It's problems mainly stem from it being unable to be a stand-alone entry like the others, and really needs to be seen in conjunction with the others to make the most sense, and is more-than-usually recommended for fans of the series.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity and a mild sex scene ","genre":null},{"date":"17 February 2007","score":"0 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Phantasm III Lord of the Dead isn't that bad, but it's got a few middling problems of it's own.**SPOILERS**Escaping from the cemetery, Mike, (A.

This discovery coincides with a huge resurgence in supernatural activity in New York which allows the Ghostbusters to reunite & reopen the business, they discover that an evil 16th Century tyrannical sorcerer named Vigo (Wilhelm von Homburg) is about to be re-incarnated so he can take over the world... Who ya' going to call to sort it out?Produced & directed by Ivan Reitman this is to date the only sequel to the huge hit that was Ghost Busters & while not as good is still a fine film. The script by stars Dan Aykroyd & Harold Ramis reunites all the old cast although the inclusion of Rick Moranis' nerdy character Louis Tully seems rather forced & unnecessary. However on the whole the film works very well, is good fun & provides plenty of light hearted entertainment. Obviously the scare factor isn't high as to appeal to he kids but there's still plenty of ghost's, ghoul's & slime to go around. The comedy elements are amusing enough, the interplay between Stanz & Spengler is quite funny & Murray's sarcastic Venkman still raises a smile. The story this time around is what lets the film down I suppose, there's not really enough here to pad out the almost 2 hour running time & the connection between the pink slime, Dana, her baby & Vigo & how it all ties to the Ghostbusters is somewhat thin to say the least, it never comes together with any great conviction but the film moves along at a nice pace & as I've said it provides lots of good, clean entertainment that's fun to watch.Director Reitman does OK but I got the feeling while watching it it borrowed a lot of ideas from the original especially the end where the Statue of Libery walks through the streets of Manhattan which is almost identical to the end of the original with the Marshmellow Man causing havoc. Considering this was made in the 80's I was actually rather impressed with the special effects & thought they were very good except the ridiculous scene where the villainous Peter MacNicol is flying through the air dressed as a nanny complete with pram which looks awful. There are some good scenes, the fur coat that comes alive, the ghost train, the Titanic arriving & lots of other ghostly goings-on.Technically the film is great & has that big budget Hollywood polish about it, the effects are good & the famous Ghostbusters theme is used once or twice. The acting is fine although I'm not sure about MacNicol's performance as he has a highly irritating accent & he annoys.Ghostbusters II is a good sequel that I enjoyed a lot although it's not as good as the original but there aren't many films that are in my opinion. Well worth a watch if your looking for some scary light hearted supernatural fun, definitely recommended.

They investigate the strange occurrence & along with the other Ghostbusters Peter Venkman (Bill Murray) & Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) discover a huge river of the pink slim running under the city, a pink slime that feeds off negative emotions & there's plenty of them around New York. This discovery coincides with a huge resurgence in supernatural activity in New York which allows the Ghostbusters to reunite & reopen the business, they discover that an evil 16th Century tyrannical sorcerer named Vigo (Wilhelm von Homburg) is about to be re-incarnated so he can take over the world... Who ya' going to call to sort it out?Produced & directed by Ivan Reitman this is to date the only sequel to the huge hit that was Ghost Busters & while not as good is still a fine film. The script by stars Dan Aykroyd & Harold Ramis reunites all the old cast although the inclusion of Rick Moranis' nerdy character Louis Tully seems rather forced & unnecessary. However on the whole the film works very well, is good fun & provides plenty of light hearted entertainment. Obviously the scare factor isn't high as to appeal to he kids but there's still plenty of ghost's, ghoul's & slime to go around.

In 1981, Puttnam hired the Greek composer Vangelis to write the score for a low budget film about two obscure athletes who competed in the 1924 Olympic Games. The resulting score, which was the most memorable attribute of the film, catapulted Chariots of Fire to a Best Picture Academy Award. A half-dozen years later, Puttnam selected the great Italian composer Ennio Morricone to pen the score for a high-minded film about the Church-sanctioned abuses of indigenous people in 18th-century South America. The result was a magnificent musical work that not only enhanced The Mission, but remains as one of the finest scores ever written for a motion picture. However, like Chariots of Fire, Roland Joffe's The Mission without its music would be less impressive.While Chris Menges's beautiful cinematography of Iguazu Falls and the South American jungles makes every frame suitable for a National Geographic centerfold, the tale of two men with conflicting moral centers often plods under the weight of its importance, which is written with a capital I. Although Robert Bolt wrote the script with obvious conviction and feeling for the injustices doled out by the Spanish and Portuguese conquerors, good intentions do not always hold the audience's attention. The man of flesh, who is intensely played by Robert De Niro, struggles with his conversion from bloody soldier to submissive Jesuit. Meanwhile, the man of spirit, equally well delineated by Jeremy Irons, ponders the hypocrisy of his Church, which seems to put politics and greed above spirituality and souls. Unfortunately, when Morricone's soaring music is not swelling through the speakers, inner struggles with guilt, penance, and the meaning of life do not make compelling cinema.However, patient viewers who can immerse themselves in the music and the painterly images on screen may find The Mission a moving experience that will leave them angry with the fate of the indigenous peoples who still struggle to hold onto their culture. One character rhetorically asks if these people would not have preferred that the Europeans had never arrived. Although The Mission is less than the sum of its parts, the film is nevertheless worth seeing for its fine performances, stunning photography, and, above all, unrivaled music.

In short, it is given the difficult task of having to bring closure in two ways 1. Closure for the character of Kirk, who's been around since the beginning of all Star Trek, and 2. Closure for the TNG series, which had just wrapped, and now had to destroy their Enterprise-D set before moving to further adventures. For the most part, you have a success until the last act.We start with a prologue with Kirk, Scotty, and Chekov which is well done, plus it's nice too see Alan Ruck show up. Kirk acts a little different than he does in the TOS movies (more on that later). There is then a clever transition to 80 years later, aboard the holodeck. For the next hour and a half, you have a great ST movie. All the TNG cast is there and Riker, Troi, Crusher, and Whoopi Goldberg are all GIVEN SOMETHING TO DO (this became a problem in the later movies, which focused on Picard and Data, and the rest of the gang felt tacked on). The story is solid, there're moments of humor, philosophical ideas behind the Nexus, and Malcolm McDowell plays a nice villain; he doesn't have much screen time, but is still well acted and had a great backstory.Where the film starts to falter is when Kirk and Picard meet side by side. The scenes fall flat for several reasons 1. The idea of the two of them meeting sounds great in theory and may excite fans, but the truth is that they're very different characters, don't really have the best chemistry or make all that great a team. 2. The premise of the Nexus starts to seem contrived, just a plausible explanation so both characters can meet, and it raises more questions than anything else. 3. The biggest problem of all is that Shatner never seems to fully get into the character of Kirk. He plays him as just a character making one-liners, winking at the camera; he knows he's just making an extended cameo. This may really be the fault of the script's; Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga had written for TNG and had never written Kirk's character before. That leads into the ending...MAJOR SPOILER! Others have said so before me the emotional impact of Kirk's death is somewhat lost because he is a supporting character in this story, and we do not see him grow very much. This is not to say it's all bad; I do very much like the idea that Picard is the only witness to his predecessor's death.And that's Generations pretty much. Great film right up till the end.

He lives in a paranoid fear and has tent to publishing his thoughts in a amateurish newsletter that he sends out to fellow geeks. He has a fixation with Alice Sutton but other than all of that he is pretty normal. However when he is grabbed off the street and tortured he only just manages to escape with his life and get to Alice. Of course nobody believes him but a few things in his story makes Alice have just a sliver of doubt that maybe he isn't crazy. She is quickly convinced when things around Jerry get out of control and it appears that somehow one of his theories has been correct enough to get someone's attentions.At the time it came out the film offered a reasonably relevance social hook and I remember this was my reason for going to see it, although I can't really remember much more about it than that. And it was so that I decided to watch it again recently to see if it was any good. The film I found was a reasonable thriller but a little bit messy and unsure of itself across the whole running time. This is seen in the way that the film never really sets a consistent tone, mixing a genuinely enjoyable conspiracy film with something akin to a normal Hollywood thriller. The story has interesting elements but mostly it is written on convenience and contrivances that never really convince (handy how Jerry remembers so much at one certain point) and didn't engage me. Compare it to Enemy of the State and you'll understand how this doesn't really work when you compare with the pace, tension and paranoia of that film against this one.Gibson mostly overplays his part into the wacky action man that he plays all too often.

Of course nobody believes him but a few things in his story makes Alice have just a sliver of doubt that maybe he isn't crazy.

And it was so that I decided to watch it again recently to see if it was any good. The film I found was a reasonable thriller but a little bit messy and unsure of itself across the whole running time. This is seen in the way that the film never really sets a consistent tone, mixing a genuinely enjoyable conspiracy film with something akin to a normal Hollywood thriller. The story has interesting elements but mostly it is written on convenience and contrivances that never really convince (handy how Jerry remembers so much at one certain point) and didn't engage me.

Just after the process though, thieves break into the lab and Tuck finds himself in a syringe with the doctor fleeing the lab. The doctor does not get far before he is killed and in desperation injects the syringe into the hapless supermarket clerk Jack Putter. With less than 24 hours of oxygen, Tuck is forced to work with his unwilling and weedy host to recover the technology stolen from the lab that is necessary to remove and enlarge him before he dies.As others have pointed out this concept is very much a matter of Fantastic Voyage II in the subject matter. It is not to be taken seriously or thought about too much (the factual goofs listed on IMDb are perhaps a sign that some viewers haven't got this) but it does deliver a fun family blockbuster than mixes imaginative sci-fi with a funny and exciting story to good effect. It isn't rocket science though and many viewers may find the content to be lacking. They are correct in some ways of course but there is enough here to compensate for it. Dante makes a difference by injecting his sense of fun into the material and making it silly but fun. He also delivers plenty of good set pieces that cross between comedy and action well.The effects are good and haven't dated that much even if they don't stand up to modern CGI. The cast help matters by managing to go along with the material and get it. Short is great value (not often I think that) and does the comedy thing well for a family audience. Quaid is cool and has good presence despite being technically away from the action for the majority of the running time. The pair have a good chemistry despite not sharing the screen. Ryan is a bit goofy but does the job while support is enjoyable from McCarthy, Lewis, Picardo and Wells.Overall then a silly family film but an enjoyable one. The story is pretty funny and pretty exciting and the director and cast work well to keep it all working in the spirit of the whole. Undemanding and fun summer movie.

When I was 15, I saw it again and it became my favorite movie of all time. I'm 16 now, and watch it at least once a month. I must have the film memorized by now, but it's purely that wonderful.This version of Robin Hood features the good-hearted thief as a nobleman who has returned from the third crusade to find his father dead and the Sheriff of Nottingham after King Richard's throne while the king is away. The storyline is wonderful, suspenseful, and spellbinding. While now Kevin Costner is not looked upon with much regard, he played his part perfectly. Critics snub this movie because he doesn't have a British accent but honestly- who cares? It didn't take away from the movie and Costner's portrayal of Robin Hood was excellent. Morgan Freemen also did very well as the faithful sidekick and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was the perfect Marian. The chemistry between her character and Costner's was very touching once romance began to surface. Alan Rickman played the role of the frightening, lustful, and evil Sheriff to a tee.Another critical note is the absence of Prince John, but honestly, I found it best that he was left out because in reality, John later got the British throne, so why insert him as the bad guy if he wins?The sets and costume are very believable- you'll feel like you're truly in in 1194! I give this movie a ten. I recommend it 100%- if you don't nitpick and you love the story of Robin Hood go see it! The ending is absolutely lovely. In my humble opinion, this is the best version of Robin Hood and a truly amazing experience to see.

She meets one Englishman called John Smith.

Reason 1 I love all the characters, even the main baddie - he has a good voice etc. My three favourite characters are Pochahontas, John Smith and Meeko (I am one of their biggest fans). Reason 2 This film is based on real life. It is very interesting to watch the only Disney classic to be based on real life. Reason 3 I love the animation, drawings and backgrounds! They are beautiful and very life-like at times. Sometimes you feel very close to the Native Americans the animation is so good. Reason 4 I love all the songs, my favourite is Colours Of The Wind. I also like Just Around The Riverbend (It's got my favourite quote What I love about rivers is, you can't step in the same river twice. The water's always changing, always flowing.).
