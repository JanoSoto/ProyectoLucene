When he is spotted by agent George Shapio, it allows him to get one of his characters onto a new sitcom.  With the success of the show he is given a stage to try different things - an opportunity that the studio regrets giving him when he varies wildly from a lounge lizard alter ego to a major show where he wrestles female audience members to the ground.As with many within the UK audience for this film, I only know Kaufman from his character in Taxi.  One thing I do know is that he was clearly a mystery with no-one, maybe not even himself, really knowing who he was or when he was being serious.  And that is what the film remembers - an enigma.  This is not the place to come for understanding, explanation or background; in fact the film skips from a brief flashback of Andy's childhood to 20 years later as a stand-up! In that regard, the film is a success because it nicely captures a man who it must have been hard to laugh at simply because he appeared to be more about having a laugh on his audience rather than at his audience.  On the strength of this film I quite like his style but am surprised he became so famous when it must have been quite hard to actually laugh at his work.The film may not do enough for those who know a lot about Kaufman's career simply because it doesn't cast light on anything - it only records some key events.  As I said, the film seems to be holding it's hands up and saying `look - we know about as much as you do' - it isn't even sure if Kaufman died for real or not.  I found it very funny though and it was an entertaining way of informing me about his career.Despite the lack of an Oscar nomination, it is Carrey who makes this film work so well - his performance is great, capturing Kaufman's routines as well as providing us with some tender moments.  DeVito is good in support even though it confused me as to who he was playing at first (Shapio or himself).  Love is not as bad as I feared she might be, although she has no character and she is still one of the weakest aspects of the film. Giamatti is as reliable as ever and is sterling in support.  Appearances from others as themselves are great and add class to the film - particularly Lawler, the cast of Taxi and several others.Overall I enjoyed this film but it engaged me because I knew so little about him.  For those who are familiar with him this film may not bring enough for them to justify seeing but even then it is lively, funny and centred on a great performance from Carrey.

He gets drunk and wakes in his car, where he is picked up for the murder of his wife and her lover.  Despite his pleas of innocence, Andy is sentenced to life in prison where he is immediately introduced to the horrors of live inside.  Fellow lifer, Red, tells Andy's story of how he held hope and managed to use his banking skills to improve the conditions for himself and others.I saw this film in the cinema when it came out and, looking back, it is surprising how little fuss was made over it at the time - I was one of 15 or 20 people in the cinema when I saw it (on it's second week out!).  However time has brought it to the top of many popular lists of films and it is mainly due to a story that is based around friendship and hope that engages and eventually uplifts.If you are going to adapt a Stephen King book, the lesson from this film and others appears to be to adapt a short one.  Here the story is set up well with all the usual stuff that we expect from prison dramas, but with the key difference that these events are not the film - no the film is about Andy and Red's friendship.  These two men are great characters and I was very easily drawn into their story.  It is witty, dark and yet enjoyable all at the same time.  It is impossible not to be affected by the ending and this simple uplifting sentiment is part of the reason it has been taken in by so many viewers as one of their favourites.Of course it is a little long at times and for my personal tastes it is a little too sentimental at times although this is to be expected with any Hollywood film.  The slightly sentimental view of the prison also goes so far to ignore the idea that there would be any homosexual relationship that aren't rape and even ruling out any suggestion of racism - there is no tension or segregation in evidence here.  I won't do spoilers but the ending was too clear for me where leaving us with more questions would have been more in holding with the idea of hope that the film had traded in prior to this.  The characters work well due to some great performances.  Robbins is great as Andy and he ages and grows well - whether or not he is believable in his calm approach to the punishment he takes is another matter, but I was caught up in the film enough to get past that.  Freeman may not be the Irish guy from the book (hence the name Red) but he is excellent as the father figure - even if he appears to age very slowly in comparison to Andy.  The chemistry between the two is the key and it really works.Of course having a support cast that includes a great number of fine support actors probably helped.  People like Gunton, Sadler, Bellows and others may not always be great but here they fit the bill. Yes the characters tend to be very clichéd (the bird man, the rapists etc) but again that comes with the genre and I was able to get past these by focusing on the main relationship.  The surprise performance for me was from Clancy Brown - not the most subtle of actors (Highlander is his other famous role) but he is very good here indeed, albeit with little actual character depth.  As director Darabont has done very well, framing some great shots (that crane shot as the bus arrives for the first time) as well as a shot that has become almost iconic.  He is helped by a score that fits the sweeping sense of hope that the film brings.Overall this is an imperfect film and it is flattered by it regular high appearance on the popular `best film' lists.  However it is also a great little story that twists and turns as it is told, it has all the clichés of the genre but at it's heart it is based on friendship and a sense of hope that it is hard not to find uplifting.  For all it's faults it is a popular and moving story that seems to do the trick for the majority of those that see it.
