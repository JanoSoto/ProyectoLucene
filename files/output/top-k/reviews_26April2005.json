The voice actors are terrible, the kid who Louis tries to put on an English accent, but fails terribly. Anna and the King is annoying too.The movie starts when they are on the way to Siam, the the Kralahome is now an evil sorcerer with magic powers for evil and conjures up a serpent. The serpent isn't even scary, the animation ruins it. They also jump into song with stupid hand movements. They all whistle and the serpent is gone. Wow, I was drowsy by this time. Master Little is also an annoying, dental crazed thing that tries to be funny but just plainly doesn't.They all arrive, the only good bit is when they show you the actually good castles. You see the king, with his friendly panther. Who is also plastically played and hardly has so personality.Then is introduces the love between Tuptim and Prince Chululongkorn, which is all wrong!!! It tries to give a forbidden love feel to it, but all it gives is a teenage crush feel.Don't get me started on those annoying animals! A monkey, panther and elephant. The monkey is terrible, you almost want to ring it's neck, the panther is the sly tame panther ( *cough*JungleBook*cough*) and that elephant Tusker, grr!!!Then it goes through, I want my house faze. Which is really boring, throw in a few cheesy songs and thats really it. There is no real climax in this. Oh yeah, and a huge moody from Anna to the king.Tuptim is thrown into a huge river to await her death, unfortunately the king has to save her. The balloon starts to burn and Prince Chululongkorn and Tuptim jump in the water. Why didn't the king, he just sat there inhaling toxic gases.The balloon goes down and here comes the main character death, but then comes back to life part. Haven't we had enough!!! Everyone is happy and Anna gets her own house (surprise surprise). The Kralahome is captured and sentenced to poop scooping.Overall, terrible film.

Kissing A Fool wants to be too many things. Can you mix successful ingredients and get the best of every world? Kissing... tries to be a '40's-style romantic comedy, a modern sex comedy and a sit-com at the same time.Co-writer\/Director Doug Ellin is a friend of Schwimmer's and Schwimmer has gone on and on about exactly how great it feels to shed his Ross-image and play the complete anti-Ross. Jason Lee stars as Jay Murphy, a sensitive nice guy who's a romance novelist and is recovering from his latest breakup with a model named Natasha (played by TV's Weird Science Vanessa Angel). He has a sweet boy-next-door demeanor about him and his real problem is he's too nice and sensitive for his own good. The worst part about being sensitive is that the world is so full of crap and garbage, people are such assholes that your feelings get hurt too often, too easy, too much. Better to be as cruel as the world or even more so and give worse than you get. Believe me, I know of what I speak of. David Schwimmer co-stars as Jay's best friend Max Abbitt, a sportscaster who's a womanizer who plays the field more than the teams reports on. A total creep and always with a dumb expression of his face, a self-satisfied drawl and his own cool-guy salutation What' up? Always a toothpick and a too cool drawl dangling from his lip. Mili Avital is unfortunately given the second-to-weakest developed character in the whole film. She's sweet, perky and photogenic... but nothing else, really. She and Lee could have some great chemistry if only the film allowed it. But this movie is written in a way that's so made-to-order, it's embarrassing. Bonnie Hunt plays the narrator that is publishing Lee's book. She's also the narrator. Why does this movie need a narrator? The narration actually manages to make the movie even less suspenseful, if that's possible. And Vanessa Angel, who broke through in TV's Weird Science and almost stole Kingpin, is given the least interesting character. She plays a model and Jay's heartless ex-girlfriend who has dumped him and left him a pathetic neurotic mess. Hers is not a character, but a plot device. The heartless bitch who is so cruel and horrible to the sweet-hearted hero so more of our sympathy goes to him. I groaned at her scenes. The movie's dialog is not always plot-driven or cutesy-poo, like most romantic comedies are (although sometimes it is). Most of the script is written in an observational sit-com kind of way. Like Seinfeld or Mad About You (or yes, even Friends). But the dramatic\/romantic scenes are embarrassingly maudlin. Is it just me or is the entire cast of Friends been trying to mimic Kevin Smith?* The Object of My Affection * Kissing A Fool * Three To Tango Smith's groundbreaking romantic comedy Chasing Amy was revolutionary, insightful... and made big waves for Ben Affleck, Joey Lauren Adams, Lee and Smith himself. A romantic comedy, a sex comedy and a relationship story. Not merely a love story, but a life story. Lately, Hollywood has been trying to make Smith-like slick Hollywood movies. So far, they failed terribly. Smith's movies are great because they are daring and avoid formulas. And they master the art of sparkling conversation. This film does neither. Nor do any of the other Kevin Smith-wannabes. Lee's character has been through the ringer and things are looking bleaker. I really liked him here and felt for him. And identified with him more than I wanted to.I knew guys like Max in high school, but in the outside world? Who knows? I was kind of like the Lee character myself. In a way, I still am. Too sensitive. Too easily vulnerable. Such a whipping boy. I did understand what Jay meant when he said, You know, I wish I had your heart. Then I wouldn't have spent so many sleepless nights.... The plot seems cruel and creepy, yet too sit-com-like at the same time. Test my fiancée''s fidelity? Almost seems like a sick ploy to throw Jay & Samantha together, doesn't it? Oh wait, it is...Anyone who has ever seen a movie will know what the ending will be. It's almost like waiting for the coyote to fall off the cliff. Schwimmer's Max Abbit character seems to dumb and dull and annoying to be interesting. He must be sick of playing the same type (The Pallbearer, Six Days, Seven Nights and TV's Friends), but this movie will do nothing for him. Still, at least he tried. I kept (back in 1999 when I first saw this movie) seeing a mad Ross trying to be bad whenever I looked at him, but now looking back on it and putting Ross out of my head (I really dislike the show anyway), Schwimmer does an effective job... however he doesn't really have dimensions and depth. He's just not an interesting womanizer. Apparently, a lot of Schwimmer fans felt confused by his role here. It feels like Schwimmer wants to play someone completely different without risking losing his hard-core audience. Schwimmer does do a much better job breaking typecasting in the forgettable Since You've Been Gone and the memorable Band of Brothers.MEMO TO Hollywood If you're gonna keep making bad Kevin Smith-knockoffs, at lest quit putting Friends actors in them.--Kissing Off This One, Dane Youssef ","genre":null},{"date":"26 April 2005","score":"6 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" by Dane YoussefNow here is a movie that wants to be something successful by combining everything successful.

He's America's most popular actor alive (statistically, anyway).Surprising, then, that the movie isn't bad. In fact, it's quite good, at least in a watchable sort of way. Although it doesn't hold a candle to the original, Cameron Crowe (Fast Times scribe and Jerry Maguire director) is still pretty capable behind the camera and Cameron Diaz proves she has some amount of acting abilities as she portrays a character unlike any other in her resume.The big disappointment is Penelope Cruz, returning to her role in the Spanish film, only this time playing it in English. And she's not very good at speaking English and we have to wonder, Why did they cast her? Plus, and maybe this is just me... but I don't find her very attractive. Between her and Diaz, I'd take Diaz, even if she was a suicidal maniac.Overall I was rather entertained and amused by the film, even if it's nothing special. And believe me, it's not. But Tom Cruise is better than expected. And his notorious vanity pays off -- we finally get to see his face all messed up. Alas, he can't remain like this for the entire duration of the film. That would be American Hollywood sacrilege. I can just hear the producers Tom Cruise playing a facially disfigured man? WHAT?!

He's America's most popular actor alive (statistically, anyway).Surprising, then, that the movie isn't bad. In fact, it's quite good, at least in a watchable sort of way. Although it doesn't hold a candle to the original, Cameron Crowe (Fast Times scribe and Jerry Maguire director) is still pretty capable behind the camera and Cameron Diaz proves she has some amount of acting abilities as she portrays a character unlike any other in her resume.The big disappointment is Penelope Cruz, returning to her role in the Spanish film, only this time playing it in English. And she's not very good at speaking English and we have to wonder, Why did they cast her? Plus, and maybe this is just me... but I don't find her very attractive. Between her and Diaz, I'd take Diaz, even if she was a suicidal maniac.Overall I was rather entertained and amused by the film, even if it's nothing special. And believe me, it's not. But Tom Cruise is better than expected. And his notorious vanity pays off -- we finally get to see his face all messed up. Alas, he can't remain like this for the entire duration of the film. That would be American Hollywood sacrilege. I can just hear the producers Tom Cruise playing a facially disfigured man? WHAT?!

I don't think so, but oh well.) It's the US taking a popular and successful foreign film (the Spanish Obres Los Ojos, a.k.a. Open Your Eyes) and re-working it with... Tom Cruise in the lead?

Sure, those were excellent films and very talented actors, but with all the focus on those actors sometimes the gems get overlooked. License to Drive is surely on of those gems.License To Drive, one of only a few films that stars both Corey Haim and Corey Feldman, is a perfect 80's teen comedy. Shot at the height of both of the Coreys careers, while they were both still in high school, the film captures their youthful spirit perfectly. License to Drive is hilarious and outrageous while still remaining simple and easy to follow.Haim plays Les Anderson who like every high school kid has nothing but girls and cars on his mind. But this isn't just any girl. Les has his eye on the most beautiful girl in school. The bombshell is played by a very young and beautiful, Heather Graham. When Les is lucky enough to score a date with the bombshell, the only obstacle he must overcome is his pending drivers license test so that he can take his fathers car to pick her up in.Like most high school students, Les slept through drivers education class and when the time comes, he fails his drivers test. But the fun has just begun. Les isn't going to let this stop him. He takes the car anyways. Uh oh... this never turns out right. The night takes a turn for the worse when Les's best friend (Corey Feldman) shows up with 'a plan.' Another bad sign. Well the night just gets wilder and wilder and ends up with Heather Graham drunk as a skunk locked in the trunk of a car, police roadblocks, crazed militants running the streets and some really mean and angry drag racers to boot.License To Drive really has it all. It's a perfect 80's teenage comedy. The DVD has loads of extra goodies including interviews with the stars and tons of deleted footage.Fasten your seat belts, you're in for one totally awesome ride!!!
