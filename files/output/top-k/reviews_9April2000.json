However, it just didn't work. The different action scenes (like when Thomas goes to steal the first painting) lacks flair or style - I immediately thought of comparing it to the opening sequence of Michael Mann's Heat, and I noticed how little flair this movie has in it. Rene Russo's character is amazingly arrogant and snobbish - she did a pretty good job in the role (although it was not all that well written), but it's hard to like her. Pierce Brosnan did an okay job but his character wasn't that likable. The cat and mouse game the two were playing wasn't all that convincing - it just didn't seem like they had much chemistry.The sex sequences were overrated and dull, and they were also far too long - they didn't have to be in the film in this quantity. While I guess they were in there to try and emphasize the cat and mouse game that Brosnan and Russo were playing, the end result was just that the filmmakers were going for shock value, because they were simply pointless.This movie was also saddled with one of the worst soundtracks I've ever heard - sequences that were intended to be intriguing and exciting were stuck with some of the worst jazz I've ever heard in my life. The music deflated the movie a great deal.In its credit, this movie did pick up at the very end (when Crown deliversthe stolen painting back), and it was enjoyable at the very end (although the music did hurt it a bit), but that doesn't help this too much (although I would have given it a 1 had the ending not been better). This movie lacked a sense of style to call its own, and it ended up being a cheap James Bond ripoff. Not recommended.

Spartacus was one of those movies. Everything about it seems perfect to me. I was not bothered by the length, as the story required a lengthy movie.  After director Anthony Mann was fired, Stanley Kubrick was brought in to work as director. If he had been the original choice for director, perhaps we would see a Spartacus with the flashy long camera shots and the deep, haunting scores, and the abstract art we have become used to from Kubrick's 2001, A Clockwork Orange, and even Full Metal Jacket. Kubrick's style is much more restrained in Spartacus. The only time when Kubrick really shines through is the battle scene, where the troops of Casuss' army asssemble to make symmetric shapes. But since Spartacus is not really the kind of movie that requires that kind of work, since a ray of hope shines over the entire thing. In the hands of a lesser director (notably Cecil B. DeMille, king of the mindless epics) it might have turned into just that, a mindless epic. But Kubrick saved that from happpening. Critics of the romance between Spartacus and Varinia may be right when they say that there is no passion there. I disagree with this, though. Besides, the love scenes gave an excuse to hear the traditional score. The score (basically consisting of 3 notes being played in the same pattern but in different keys and by different instruments) is perhaps the most touching thing about the movie, and its simplicity drives what is going on on screen home.  The movie's screenplay and story takes the best elements from such movies as Braveheart, Ben-Hur, and even the Ten Commandments and gives it to much better actors. Though the story may have many factual errors, it gives the actors a chance to shine in their work.  The acting is top quality. Almost every legend of the silver screen had his role that made him one, the role that when one thinks of the actor, they must think of the role also. Marlon Brando had his Vito Corleone, Clark Gable had his Rhett Butler,  Orson Welles had his Charles Foster Kane, even Anthony Quinn had his Zorba the Greek. Well, Kirk Douglas has his Spartacus. Although his character required little acting, and he was not oscar-worthy in it, he gave Spartacus an identity. Other acting standouts are oscar-winner Peter Ustinov as Spartacus's former owner, Laurence Olivier as the evil dictator Cassus, and though most people would disagree with me, Tony Curtis as Antoninus.This is a 5-star movie, see it soon.

But despite these fleeting moments (think Thelma and Louise or Steel Magnolias) there is one thing you cannot deny about Ms. Roberts she is the same in every movie.There are many subtle variations, I'll give her that, but when you boil it down to its essential elements, Julia's performances coast by on a few melancholy looks, a few shy smiles, and a lower lip that juts in the cutest way.  If you think about the movies Julia has shined in, they are typically the films with intense plots.  But when you stop to imagine her in some of her more shallow films, the parallels are impossible to ignore.  Her latest film Erin Brockovitch is such a film.Don't get me wrong.  It's entertaining.  But it's formulaic.  A cinematic experience made with a cookie-cutter plot.  The story Julia is brash young unwed mother of three Erin Brockovitch who manages to score a job filing forms at a small-time law firm.  Erin's take-no-sass attitude and foul-mouthed pluckiness soon take her far, and she ends up with a raise and a new car.  This woman with no traditional schooling beyond a few years of high school manages to bring together some 600+ members of a big chemical scandal, memorize all of their families, diseases, phone numbers, and life histories, and does it in this no-nonsense, down-to-earth, sassy way.They win the lawsuit and the big mean corporation has to pay up 300+ million dollars to the working man.  Hip hip hooray!I didn't ruin the movie for you.  It's not a surprise.  This movie floats on the same emotive capacities that all based-on-a-true-story enterprises bank on.  Because of that, its basic story is only interesting as something off of which to bounce Erin's personality.  Which is entertaining enough, although I don't know if I would call it good theatre. With a storyline with about as much subtlety as a Three Stooges movie, Erin Brockovitch's basic accomplishments fall in the same vein as the Stooges.  Just as no one ever watched Curly to see a well-constructed plot, so Erin Brockovitch's exploits become an excuse just to watch her act all tough and in-your-face with everyone.Vanilla isn't the best flavor, that's true, but it's a fail safe.  Likewise, I wouldn't recommend Erin Brockovitch to anybody with uncompromising and discriminating tastes; but anyone looking for basic, well-commercialized entertainment and prepackaged humor should come with a spoon and a bib.

Miguel and Tulio are the lifelong friends with very different personalities. We first meet them gambling riches for a map to El Dorado, the secret city of Gold. They win through creating. Therefore Tulio and Miguel devise an improvised escape leading them to hiding in barrels boarding a ship. When the captain discovers the stowaways he is not happy-but at nightfall the friends escape from captivity once again. This is when they become accustomed to their new friend, a horse. As the three pondering souls drift about the massive sea, they begin to lose hope. Just when everything seems hopeless, however, Tulio and Miguel hit the shore, which just so happens to be the island inheriting the road to El Dorado. \tRoad To El Dorado certainly has an action packed, fast paced opening, which works well.

Homer Wells is given up by his natural parents as a baby, and for one reason or another is never adopted. Because of his long tenure at the orphanage, the home's good doctor (Michael Caine, who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his work here) teaches him how to be a doctor, and the two share many of the child-rearing duties at the orphanage. Assisted by Nurses Edna (Jane Alexander) and Angela (Kathy Baker), the duo perform countless deliveries of unwanted babies. There's a flip side to this issue, of course - the unwanted pregnancies that are aborted. Homer can't bring himself to perform the abortions, but Dr. Larch can. While the abortion issue isn't central to the plot of the movie, it is an integral piece to Homer's own coming-of-age. At some point, Homer must fly the coop and live life on his own, and here is where the comparisons to characters such as Forrest Gump or even Robin Williams' Garp come into play. Homer leaves the orphanage in due time, but he also leaves behind his family, including his fatherly superior, Dr. Larch, who loves the boy so much that he doesn't want him to go out into the world and be a failure when he knows Homer could stay at the orphanage and be useful.   This sweeping tale checks in at over 2 hours, but it's not a yawner by any stretch. Homer is forthright, honest, and above all respectful, all qualities sadly lacking in many people today. (Luckily, this film takes place in the first half of the 20th century, so those characteristics don't seem out of place.) Caine is amazing in his role, completely dropping his famous Cockney accent in favor of a stentorial New England dialect. Once you get past hearing him sound like an American, you'll be fine - but it's a little jarring at first. One could almost make an argument that Caine could have been up for Best Actor, but this is clearly a movie about Homer, not Dr. Larch.    As for Maguire.... Well, there's something to be said for subtle performances, to be sure, but there's also something to be said about underplaying a roll too much. Maguire simply is miscast. He's earnest, but there's not much expression to be read on his face. To put it succintly, he's more than underwhelming in the lead role. The antithesis of Maguire is the lovely and VERY talented Charlize Theron, a young woman who comes to the orphanage to have an abortion. Theron is stunning, but what really grabs you is her magnificent, moving, and endearing performance. This is an actress to keep your eyes on, ladies and gentlemen.

What is most remarkable about this film is that it manages not only to set up a fascinating moral dilemma for both the characters and the audience but, most amazingly, to stay true and honest to it throughout the course of the entire film.Brokedown Palace, whose plot echoes Return to Paradise, falls several notches below the earlier film mostly because it saves its moral dilemma until the very end of the story.  The resolution is a powerful one when it comes, but the delay robs the film as a whole of some of its interest.  In this film, Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsdale play recent high school graduates who opt to visit Thailand instead of Hawaii and run into a sleazy young con man who plants heroin on them - an act for which, when it is discovered by the authorities, the girls are falsely imprisoned.  The bulk of the film concerns itself with the attempts by an American lawyer (Bill Pullman) to clear their names and secure their freedom. Much of the film plays like a rehash of Midnight Express, as the girls are badgered and threatened through their interrogations and forced to endure the rigors of a Third World prison - although, strangely enough, the horrors seem oddly downplayed at times.  These are the weakest sections of the film for the visualization of the experience seems almost too glamorized at times, as if the commercial-minded filmmakers didn't dare risk alienating these actresses' many fans by offending their sensibilities.  Still, the situation is a ripe one for intense audience identification since who cannot empathize with a couple of fun loving adolescents caught in a nightmarish web not of their own making?  Actually, the sharpest aspect of the film is the underlying theme of the scary part seemingly insignificant actions and decisions can play in determining the course of one's entire life.  Constantly, the girls are forced to wonder what if we had gone to Hawaii...what if we had not met the drug smuggler...what if we had not snuck into the hotel to order drinks on a stranger's room bill, etc.  The movie also achieves some depth in its final moments as Alice (Danes) grapples with a major moral decision and discovers the redemption for a life built on a pattern of seemingly insignificant deceit and lies.  She realizes that a person's character is made up of ALL the actions she performs in a lifetime, regardless of how trivial or benign they may seem at the time.  In addition, she learns the often horrifying price true friendship sometimes demands - and her final actions betoken a personal maturation that helps lift her character far above the rung of conventional movie heroines.Brokedown Palace may occasionally seem tedious in its details, but the thematic depth and moral underpinnings that lie within it make it a film worth watching.

In this film, Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsdale play recent high school graduates who opt to visit Thailand instead of Hawaii and run into a sleazy young con man who plants heroin on them - an act for which, when it is discovered by the authorities, the girls are falsely imprisoned.  The bulk of the film concerns itself with the attempts by an American lawyer (Bill Pullman) to clear their names and secure their freedom. Much of the film plays like a rehash of Midnight Express, as the girls are badgered and threatened through their interrogations and forced to endure the rigors of a Third World prison - although, strangely enough, the horrors seem oddly downplayed at times.  These are the weakest sections of the film for the visualization of the experience seems almost too glamorized at times, as if the commercial-minded filmmakers didn't dare risk alienating these actresses' many fans by offending their sensibilities.  Still, the situation is a ripe one for intense audience identification since who cannot empathize with a couple of fun loving adolescents caught in a nightmarish web not of their own making?  Actually, the sharpest aspect of the film is the underlying theme of the scary part seemingly insignificant actions and decisions can play in determining the course of one's entire life.  Constantly, the girls are forced to wonder what if we had gone to Hawaii...what if we had not met the drug smuggler...what if we had not snuck into the hotel to order drinks on a stranger's room bill, etc.  The movie also achieves some depth in its final moments as Alice (Danes) grapples with a major moral decision and discovers the redemption for a life built on a pattern of seemingly insignificant deceit and lies.  She realizes that a person's character is made up of ALL the actions she performs in a lifetime, regardless of how trivial or benign they may seem at the time.  In addition, she learns the often horrifying price true friendship sometimes demands - and her final actions betoken a personal maturation that helps lift her character far above the rung of conventional movie heroines.Brokedown Palace may occasionally seem tedious in its details, but the thematic depth and moral underpinnings that lie within it make it a film worth watching.

CEO. I couldn't believe what I was reading. PG&E should have just passed on commenting on this movie...after all, the settlement's a done deal. But Smith had to remind us (as if we don't have a brain in our collective heads) that it 'primarily a vehicle for entertainment'. He goes on to make some extremely lame statements about how PG&E didn't move as quickly as it should have to rectify the problem but acted in good faith...yada yada yada. Jeez, cut your losses Gordie! Don't make it worse with such lame excuses!That e-mail piqued my interest in the movie. Although rather formulaic and featuring a few too many cardboard characters and scenes, EB is a very enjoyable movie. There are some hilarious one-liners, particularly toward the end of the movie. Unlike some others, I didn't feel the movie was overlong or slowly paced. However, I would have liked to have seen more on the legal issues and less on how poor EB is struggling to keep her personal life together. As it was, the movie completely skips the entire settlement process. In one scene, Roberts and Finney are collectly signatures from plaintiffs to pursue a settlement and in the next, she's telling a woman that the court has awarded her family $5 million.All in all though, definitely worth seeing.Oh, and for those of you who want to flame me for working for the big bad oppressive evil corporate empire, save your breath. PG&E is a massive corporation and I work very far from Hinkley (which, ironically, isn't even in the PG&E service area, though Kettleman Hills is). I currently work in the Vegetation Management Dept. (tree trimming and fire prevention mostly) but used to work in Energy Efficiency (trying to conserve energy and save people money). So I don't think of myself as a captalist running dog lackey, or even as a bad guy...but then, neither did Hitler. All I can say is that I probably enjoyed seeing them stick to PG&E more than you did.
