I guess I won't be able to say everything that's great about this film, but surely I will try.Mathieu Kassovitz is showing us one day in the life of three violent young men. One of them is Jewish (Vinz), one of them Arab (Saïd), and the third one is black (Hubert). They live in a very violent hood full of riots. They're strongly involved in the conflict with the police. They don't have any other interests, except to become a wannabe street heroes, although Hubert does some boxing at the gym that has been burnt somewhere in the beginning of the movie. La haine starts with the scene of riots on the streets of France. I'm not informed when and why these things were happening, but it doesn't matter, cause they can happen every moment, in every corner of the world. In fact, these things are happening at this exact moment in which I'm writing. Opening scene is perfectly followed by Bob Marley's Burnin' and Lootin, a sweet reggae melody. You can see some irony here. Then, we learn, from the TV news, that some Arabian guy has been wounded by the hand of the police. We meet the characters and then the story flows like a water. Story itself contains several events happening in a chronological order at different times of day. It is very well composed so we can understand the characters and the problems they're dealing with. They are chasing their identities and personalities. They are trying to be something what they consider to be right. But they are slaves of the modern society, and the slaves of the occasions in which they are. They are immature, they don't think before they do, and worst of all, they are hiding the truth from themselves. This is a story about the hunt for identity, about youth that is lost in the chaos of modern society, so when they try to find themselves, they actually become part of that chaos. Heard about the guy who fell off a skyscraper? On his way down past each floor, he kept saying to reassure himself So far so good... so far so good... so far so good. How you fall doesn't matter. It's how you land! They are falling, but they are lying to themselves on the way down, and when they touch the ground, it won't end happily.La haine (Hate) is simple, yet powerful name for movie. It fits perfectly with its main theme. Hate. Unreasonable hate. People who hate something or someone because their friends and idols do that, because it's popular, because they want to feel accepted by the group. It's not a problem in violence, it's a problem in its cause.Whole film is filled with the symbols. I noticed some of them, I read some of the messages, but I'm sure that there are many more that I will catch on the second watching.Episode with the old man in the toilet? Brilliant. Whole symbolic Grunwalski story about the pride and death and the way it was told. Tadek Lokcinski like a prophet here, totally steals the scene in a few minutes of his appearance. A strong moral behind the story, but the boys can't understand it yet. It will cost them, so they will learn it on the hard way.Paroles on the walls that we can see everywhere around the city. One of them The World is yours (Said corrected it to The World is ours) is the main motto of these young men. They want to try everything, and they want it now, but they don't see the hole on the end of the road they went. This also may indicate Scarface, which contains similar messages.One more thing that I found interesting was the picture of the poet, Charles Baudelaire on the building at the end of the movie, and I am sure that this isn't randomly put there. Baudelaire wrote the poem called Le Tonneau de la Haine (The Cask of Hate) so there's an obvious connection.I like the fact that the characters have the same names as the actors that play them. Crime isn't glorified in this movie, neither is the law. Violence is strongly criticized, modern society isn't spared either. Nothing is exaggerated, this is pretty realistic picture of what's happening around and inside us. We can get to like the characters, but it would be wrong if we agreed with most of their deeds.Did we learn something from this movie? Well, we learned plenty of things. Paris, so as the world, isn't just a city of love, there are black and gray sides of it. It may be easy to tell, but not to do. Especially to pull the trigger and kill the face in front of you. Neither side of the conflict is absolutely right or absolutely wrong. Sometimes is better to swallow the pride. Batman is not so strong. Directing and camera work are great, acting too, dialogs are smooth and interesting even with the English subtitles, so I can only dream how much this is enjoyable for the French speaker. Soundtrack is one more great part of the film. I didn't write the flaws of the movie because when I watch some gem of the cinema like this one, I try to concentrate on the good parts of it, and as I said, La haine is full of them. And still, there are many things that I forgot to write, or missed while I was watching.10\/10 I suggest it to everyone, don't be repelled by the bunch of kids who try to identify with the characters in this movie.

This case requires him to defend a man (Tyrone Power) who is accused of killing an old, rich lady (Norma Varden) whom he had developed a fond friendship with. He's accused of the crime because she made him the main acceptor of her will. This case becomes more complicated when the defendant's German wife (Marlene Dietrich) testifies against her husband because she's actually married to another man. The lawyer finds this particular part of the case strange because wives should naturally be supportive of their husbands no matter what. From there, many more complicated issues take place with attempting to solve this case that it all leads up to a shocking finale. This finale was so famous that the filmmakers literally put up a disclaimer at the end of the film telling its audiences not to talk about it or give away the film's secret. You don't see that type of disclaimer nowadays anymore, do you? While I can't say that this is one of the most shocking endings ever, I will say that I do appreciate the filmmaker's attempt to keep the ending a secret as much as possible. That's more than I can say for all the movie trailers and commercials today which seem to give away too much about certain movies. But that's another subject I'll plan to tackle another time via editorial. One of the best aspects about Witness for the Prosecution overall was the relationship between the lawyer and the nurse. I love how this lawyer sort of does whatever he can to disobey his nurse's advice and how much this nurse unintentionally drives him nuts. I thought they handled that relationship very well. Neither of them came off as bad simply because they disagreed with each other, they just constantly got in each other's way so to speak. As far as courtroom dramas go, I don't think that Witness for the Prosecution is the strongest film I've seen from this genre, but I think it's a pretty good picture in its own right. The storytelling is focused and the acting by the likes of Laughton and Lanchester are well done. However, I'm split in regards to what I feel about the main case itself. Sometimes I was interested in the developments that arose in the case. Other times, I wasn't either due to being unable to understand certain parts or just finding the characters involved in the case not that interesting. This doesn't put the film to a halt by any means, it just makes the better parts of the picture stand out more. As a whole, Witness for the Prosecution does what it was intended to do. If you like courtroom dramas in general, this film does the intended purposes films in this genre are supposed to do. And if you'll settle for that, then you won't be let down by any means.

This case requires him to defend a man (Tyrone Power) who is accused of killing an old, rich lady (Norma Varden) whom he had developed a fond friendship with. He's accused of the crime because she made him the main acceptor of her will. This case becomes more complicated when the defendant's German wife (Marlene Dietrich) testifies against her husband because she's actually married to another man. The lawyer finds this particular part of the case strange because wives should naturally be supportive of their husbands no matter what. From there, many more complicated issues take place with attempting to solve this case that it all leads up to a shocking finale. This finale was so famous that the filmmakers literally put up a disclaimer at the end of the film telling its audiences not to talk about it or give away the film's secret. You don't see that type of disclaimer nowadays anymore, do you? While I can't say that this is one of the most shocking endings ever, I will say that I do appreciate the filmmaker's attempt to keep the ending a secret as much as possible. That's more than I can say for all the movie trailers and commercials today which seem to give away too much about certain movies. But that's another subject I'll plan to tackle another time via editorial. One of the best aspects about Witness for the Prosecution overall was the relationship between the lawyer and the nurse. I love how this lawyer sort of does whatever he can to disobey his nurse's advice and how much this nurse unintentionally drives him nuts. I thought they handled that relationship very well. Neither of them came off as bad simply because they disagreed with each other, they just constantly got in each other's way so to speak. As far as courtroom dramas go, I don't think that Witness for the Prosecution is the strongest film I've seen from this genre, but I think it's a pretty good picture in its own right. The storytelling is focused and the acting by the likes of Laughton and Lanchester are well done. However, I'm split in regards to what I feel about the main case itself. Sometimes I was interested in the developments that arose in the case. Other times, I wasn't either due to being unable to understand certain parts or just finding the characters involved in the case not that interesting. This doesn't put the film to a halt by any means, it just makes the better parts of the picture stand out more. As a whole, Witness for the Prosecution does what it was intended to do. If you like courtroom dramas in general, this film does the intended purposes films in this genre are supposed to do. And if you'll settle for that, then you won't be let down by any means.

As the movie unfolds, you'll once see this part again and understand it all completely. The film then zooms forward to hear Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) speaking and saying how he's going to be dead in a year, but in a way, he's already dead. Of course he doesn't know this yet as the film is set back in a year before, but I'm sure he wishes that he could be dead sooner then later. Twenty minutes later into the movie, the Burnham's get new neighbours, and that's where everyone's lives start to completely change, for better and for worse. I will leave the rest of the movie for you to watch and find out.The characters in this film are all characterized with critique and uniqueness, and they all have a meaning in this film. Lester Burnham is a man in mid life crisis that just wants to do something with his life other then watching it pass day by day. His wife, Carolyn Burnham, (Annette Bening) is a phony. She tries to act perfect in every singe way and be ordinary like everyone else, except better. His daughter, Jane Burnham, is a girl who is insecure and just wants someone who can be there for her, care for her, and make her feel special and beautiful. Her friend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) is a girl who wants to be a model and thinks that she's perfect and that every guys just wants to sleep with her. Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley) is a young adult who has had a troubled life, mostly because of his fathers opinions on things and the way his father deals with Ricky's problems.The acting in this film was great. All of the actors in this movie played their part the way that they should have, and they all did it as well as they could have. The screenplay for this film is spectacular. It had a great story line, had great dialogue, and it had a great message. Alan Ball really out did himself here, and he deserved all of the recognition that he got for this film.This was Sam Mendes first film that hit the big screen rather then making it's debut as a t.v movie. Mendes takes full advantage here and does a great job, which is one of the reasons why this movie was so great. His direction was just amazing here, plain and simple.Overall, American Beauty is a wonderful film. Of course, I'm only fourteen so I haven't been in the stages of life that these characters were in, but I'm sure I'll watch American Beauty again when I'm in my mid forties, and I'm sure that I will love and understand this film much more.

That film was released a couple years before this one and you can tell that they basically took the toxic waste from that film, applied it to a high school and ended up with this thing. For the most part the first half of the film is extremely fun as we get the typical group of teenagers doing all sorts of crazy and rude things. I should say these are Troma teens and not your typical teens next door. Once a nuclear joint gets smoked by the virgin lovers (Janelle Brady, Gil Brenton) things start to pick up in the gore department. The monster here certainly isn't scary but I really don't think it was meant to be. Apparently the entire costume was never completed, which explains why we only see its upper half throughout the picture. If you're a fan of gory, over-the-top violence then you're going to get plenty of that here as countless heads are ripped off and various other body parts are fractured and torn apart as well. The performances are exactly what you'd expect from a C picture but I will admit that Brady and Brenton at least kept you entertained in the events going on.

While even City Lights showed Chaplin in a dramatic role, Modern Times seems to me, even today, as primary a dramatic, tragic film about the Great Depression, and only secondary as a comedy.

Inside Job (2010) or Capitalism A Love Story (2009) cannot even hold a candle to this.

He has made great film after great film, and I think Fanny and Alexander ranks among his top three finest achievements (along with The Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries). It differs interestingly from every other movie of his I've seen in its taking in large part a child's point of view. This wasn't only rare for Bergman but it's rare to see a movie made by anyone that shows children, in their viewing of the adult world around them, in such a realistic and interesting way, involving both trauma and joy in these young lives. Yet the children (Alexander being more prominent than Fanny of the titles characters) don't get in the way of showing the great dynamics and complexities of the adult world as well. And these two worlds&#x97;those of children and adults&#x97;interact in pleasant and somewhat grim ways.From the start with Alexander alone in his grandmother's apartment, through an extravagant Christmas party, to the richness of the theater, to the much darker residence of the next chapter of this family's life, the movie is simply an exquisite piece of artistic beauty of early 20th Century Sweden. On a visual level Bergman has always been a master, but here he showed a more lively and ambitious side than he had before. The performances are all terrific, and I'm particularly fond of Bertil Guv as Alexander, Gun Wallgren as his reserved grandmother, and Jarl Kulle as his boisterous uncle.The movie, in spite of some quite dark elements, is quite a bit more upbeat than typical Bergman film. Those that may have admired his earlier works but felt them a little overbearing and depressing will likely welcome this ride with the great peaks and valleys of this family. Whether Alexander really has some power to see these images or if it's only a child's vivid imagination leaves room for exploration.My rating here is based primarily on the over five hour version. The two separate versions of the movie are both great experiences, with slightly different moods and emphasis, though I prefer the longer television one and that's the one I will look forward to seeing more times in the future. I understand they wanted to get a reasonable length for the theaters, but for me the shortened version lacks a lot of the richness of the other, removing great scenes especially from the back half of the film.

It's a movie that you'll watch again and again.Stars Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Clancy Brown, William Sadler, Mark Rolston. Year 1994 ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"9 June 2013","score":"","review":" Before we can critically assess The Shawshank Redemption, we first have to deal with The Shawshank Reputation. In addition to its Oscar nominations and huge critical acclaim, the film has topped the IMDb Top 250 for years and shows no signs of dropping off any time soon. Any attempt to criticize it could come across as churlish or contraries, the work of someone attempting to be above what is popular for their own self-righteous sake. Fortunately, there is little need to criticize - for Shawshank really is as great as people make it out to be.It's easy to forget how much of a slow-burning success Shawshank was. Despite favorable reviews and its many nominations, the film barely broke even on first release. It was only with the VHS release that word began to spread like wildfire, so that by the turn of the century it had garnered a reputation as a modern American great. In an age where films are dead in the water if they don't perform on opening weekend, it is hard to imagine a situation in which another Shawshank could emerge (although Slumdog Millionaire is a reasonable candidate).It's equally easy to forget how brutal the film is, particularly in its first 20 minutes. Shawshank's reputation as a popular favorite might lead the uninitiated to thinking that it's an uplifting, feel-good film - and it is true that these later moments are the ones which have most entered into popular consciousness. But any film about hope needs a source of despair to provide conflict, and Shawshank has more than enough violence and emotional trauma to justify its 15 certificate. As Mark Kermode famously remarked, there's a whole lot of Shawshank before the Redemption.Even without its reputation, Shawshank is one of the best adaptations of Stephen King's work. Indeed, among King's dramatic stories, it is outshone only by its successor The Green Mile. Frank Darabont has a greater understanding of King than almost any other filmmaker he gets the tone spot on and recreates the period setting brilliantly with the help of Roger Deakins' cinematography. Despite the much-parodied narration that punctuates the film, the drama unfolds naturally and believably throughout, with the characters always being at the forefront and naked exposition being kept to a bare minimum.Shawshank is a good example of how adaptation works - or more specifically, how changes made to the original story in translation often benefit the finished product. The best example of this is the character of Red, who in the original novel is a red-headed Irishman. This is referred to jokingly by Morgan Freeman in one of his first conversations with Tim Robbins; when Andy asks why people call him Red, Red responds Maybe it's because I'm Irish..On top of Freeman's obvious ability, the casting decision makes sense because it adds an extra layer of meaning to the character. Red is one of the few black characters we come across; while he applies himself in different ways, he is as much of an outsider as Andy DuFresne. This is borne out by his remarks about institutionalization, which are laughed off by his fellow inmates. Red may be well-connected when it comes to smuggling things in, but otherwise he is just as lonely as Andy.Shawshank approaches the theme of institutionalization with great grace and dexterity. Because the story takes place over three decades, the temptation would be to canter through the plot points and cut straight to Andy's escape - you could even stage the entire story in flashback. Instead, Darabont allows the film to unfold at a gentle, gradual pace, reflecting the mind-set of the characters. They don't realize how trapped they are until it's too late, just as we don't realize that two- and-a-half hours has passed until the credits have begun to roll.Shawshank is perhaps the most powerful depiction of hope in all of cinema. The original short story, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, was subtitled 'Hope Springs Eternal'. The film returns to hope and the celebration of the human spirit like a leitmotif, and succeeds because it retains Andy's humanity in all its many shades. While he is very different to the other prisoners, he is never presented as a saint or goody-goody, smiling gormless in the face of maddening torment. This makes his endurance all the more powerful we recognize our faults in his moments of weakness, and aspire to his inner moral strength.The only fly in the ointment with Shawshank is its ending. The film is about hope as a value in and of itself, emphasizing the importance of having it even if it is not rewarded. Red's transition to embracing hope is far more important than his reunion with Andy, and this reunion shifts the film's message from celebrating hope to justifying the characters' pain on the basis of a happy ending. It's also clear that this ending was put together at the last minute, with subtle shifts in the cinematography and a far more rushed pacing to it.The Shawshank Redemption may not be entirely worthy of its number one ranking on IMDb, but it remains a really terrific piece of drama let down only by its final scene. In every other aspect it's a masterpiece, as a character piece, a treatise on hope and a beautifully paced and mounted Stephen King adaptation. It remains a must-see for all film fans of penchant or persuasion, earning its status as a modern classic and securing a warm place in our hearts.

Lost in Space is based on the very old TV series and has been spruced up by the typical Hollywood glitz. I never really got into the original series and the movie didn't really reach my expectations.The situation is that the Earth is dying and Professor Robinson is going on a mission to travel to another planet and build a hypergate so that colonists may move to this new world. Unfortunately there is an organisation that wishes to halt this progress and instead colonise this world for themselves. They pay Doctor Smith (Gary Oldman) to sabotage the mission, and decide to kill him while he is on the ship. When the ship, the Jupiter 2, takes off, Doctor Smith is on board as well as a killer robot.There is no single plot in this movie as once one problem is solved another one arises. The ultimate goal is to either return home or to complete their mission but this is not addressed in the movie. It is left open so as to possibly bring out a sequel. The plot elements are developed from the beginning though so the movie is a bit predictable. There is a large emphasis placed on Will Robinson's time travel experiments and they also talk about how hyperspace engines will send you to a random place in the galaxy and thus are very unreliable. When they mentioned that I knew how they were going to become lost.This movie places emphasis more on family values and seems to be directed towards those of use who are or are planning on becoming fathers. Basically the moral is that our family is the most important part of our lives and we should put a lot of time into it. Professor Robinson wanted to head the mission but said that the only way he would do it is if his family came along. This is really selfish as it would have been far better if he did not marry and have a family so that he had no ties when he went gallivanting off over the galaxy. This idea is brought up. I guess they want to address the growing problem of families that are breaking apart. The family unit is no longer as solid as people believed that it was and the reason addressed in this movie is because we all pursue our own personal goals and not as a family.

What they did was something horror lovers were waiting a long time for. This print of The Beyond is beautifully restored and remastered. You can now watch it in all its Italian gory glory. We also have to thank another gorehound named Quentin Tarantino for his great DVD label Rolling Thunder Pictures, which The Beyond is co-released under.The film opens in Louisiana, 1927, We see a painter named Shweik (Antoine St John) alone in his room at a hotel working on his art. Meanwhile some townspeople are floating down a river nearby towards the hotel, we can only suspect that they are going to cause trouble with the constant cross cutting. The look of this opening sequence was shot in color, but Cinematographer Sergio Salvati uses a brown sepia tone to give it that spaghetti western flashback effect. After the locals find Shweik in his room they proceed to lash him with iron chains and this is where Lucio Fulci's trademark gore FX comes into play. With each crash of the chain, Shweiks skin is torn open and blood begins to seep out. Fulci takes great care to let each shot play out so we are replused but thrilled at the same time.After dragging Shweik to the dark grungy basement, and lashing him even more, the locals nail him to the wall with metal spikes. This isn't the worst part, after successfully pinning him to the wall, they take buckets and shovels full of quicklime and throw it on Shweiks body and face. Then as Fabio Frizzi's funky score kicks in we watch as the acid slowly corrodes Shweik. What an opening!!!Flash forward to 1981, A young beauty named Liza Merrill (Catriona MacColl) has come into owning the hotel and shes trying to restore it. A local painter is on a scaffold and suddenly he sees a white eyed woman, he then falls to the ground and the blood dribbles out of his mouth. Liza and company take care of the injured man and they try to find out what made him fall. He screams The eyes!. The room the painter saw the mysterious woman in is Room 36, the same room Shweik inhabited. Liza hires a plumber named Joe to fix the leak in the basement, Joe is of course unaware that the wall hes working on is one of the 7 Gates to Hell. A hand flies out at Joe and proceeds to gouge his eyeball right out!Throughout the rest of the film, Liza meets several people including Emily (Sarah Keller) a blind girl who warns Liza about the evil in the hotel and a local doctor played by David Warbeck who helps Liza get through all the events going on. You might notice that the film doesn't really have a solid storyline, instead its a sequence of images and sounds that are meant to give you the feeling that you are IN The Beyond where no one is safe from evil forces. NOTE Watch out for some funny little moments including a shot of a DO NOT ENTRY sign in the hospital and Liza delivering the line You have carte blanche but NOT a blank check.Lucio Fulci's cinema team, headed by Make Up\/FX artist Gianetto De Rossi did an incredible job of creating the visual effects. The Italian film crews really were masters of on-the-spot invention and they were brilliant at creating something great from nothing. The Beyond contains things you just wont see in other horror films, including acid destroying skin, heads exploding, a killer tarantula attack on a man's face and lots of eye gouging and popping. You'll also see a dog ripping out a womans throat! Note You can see the influence of Fulci's gore FX in Quentin Tarantino's film Kill Bill (2003-04).Fulci's style of directing was very exploitive, but he also had an artistic style as well. I think thats one reason many film lovers consider Fulci a master. He was capable of really grossing you out, but also adding an intelligence and surrealistic quality to a story that by another director just wouldn't have the same feeling.

Note You can see the influence of Fulci's gore FX in Quentin Tarantino's film Kill Bill (2003-04).Fulci's style of directing was very exploitive, but he also had an artistic style as well. I think thats one reason many film lovers consider Fulci a master. He was capable of really grossing you out, but also adding an intelligence and surrealistic quality to a story that by another director just wouldn't have the same feeling.

The problem is, he goes on the wrong adventure, and the things that are happening to him are all real, but he doesn't realise it.There are some funny bits in it... I love the scene where Bill gets mugged but he thinks it is all part of the act and plays along. There were not too many laugh out loud moments, but the film was still very amusing.The casting was good, but the acting was questionable.

He plans one last heist before retiring. However he needs funds and backing. He finds his way to Alonzo D. Emmerich played by Louis Calhern, a powerful but crooked lawyer who unbeknown to everyone is almost broke. He agrees to bankroll the plan but also schemes to double cross all involved. A web of characters is revealed including strong-arm man, Dix Handley, played by Sterling Hayden. The robbery takes place, but bad luck brings the whole enterprise undone. The weakness of many of the protagonists is exposed, but loyalty and honour is found in some surprising places.Throughout the story, the forces of law and order led by John McIntyre as Commissioner Hardy close in on the lawbreakers. But Hardy also has to deal with corruption within the ranks of the police force. The Asphalt Jungle has a superb script. Much of the credit for this belongs to W. R. Burnett's novel. It is surprising how much of the dialogue came straight from the book. There are slight differences in the story, but the movie is very much as Burnett wrote it. To give the film its due, the dialogue plays better than it reads, it has a pattern and rhythm that works very well on the screen, testimony to the shadings Huston and company brought to it.It would be hard to find a film with a more perfect cast. There are a number of career best performances in this film. Although Sterling Hayden was never an actor of great range, he was born to play Dix Handley. Handley is tough and dangerous but guided by a personal code of honour &#x96; he gains sympathy as a man forced by circumstances onto a path of crime.All the characters shine in their roles but it is Louis Calhern who steals the movie. As crooked lawyer Alonzo D. Emmerich he projects power and menace on the one hand and great weakness on the other. The scene where he attempts to double cross Dix and Doc is mesmerizing as his bluster and confidence wilts under their disbelieving gaze. The betrayal of his bedridden wife is also painful to watch as he plans to flee with stolen gems and his mistress &#x96; he feels guilt over his deceit but is too weak to stop. Sam Jaffe was nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actor &#x96; he was good, but Louis Calhern was better.Marilyn Monroe in an early role gives the film added piquancy. She plays Emmerich's mistress Angela. Consorting with a woman young enough to be his granddaughter, exhorts a disgusted Commissioner Hardy. The scene where Emmerich kisses her passionately is wince-inducing to say the least. It was a minor part for her, but she is stunning in her few scenes.With classy black and white photography, and location work instead of studio sets, The Asphalt Jungle is gritty and immediate. It had a big influence on crime films of the 1950's but none of its imitators ever came close to surpassing the original.

Barbara's version takes away most of the message, avoids the subject and meaning of the novel, and merely sets up pretty stage Sometimes a Great Notion, by Ken Kesey. Superb book that far exceeds his One Flew Over the Cuckoo Nest. That one misses the point by having the main character focus on the female lead, a kind of claim the woman ending. Nolte's ending utterance, Lowenstein, Lowenstein, has the same impact. Neither the book nor the movie are about possessing a woman, or about a meaningful affair with someone. If men are going to be defined by their relationship with women it will be as tragic as the woman as property attitude men express.After seeing the movie and reading the novel repeatedly, I chose Hunting Island, SC for a Fall vacation. As you drive across SC there is a fall point, a descent from the uplands of the western half, down to sea level. You smell the salt marshes before you see them.

Unfortunately for them, the masked murderer named Jason makes that impossible. It's a great addition to the collection and worth watching just for the 3D affects. Give it a try, and find out why the van is on fire.. ","genre":"Horror, Thriller"}]
