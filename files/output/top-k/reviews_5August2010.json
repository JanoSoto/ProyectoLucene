Equipped with the playfulness which turns him into a child-like creature in our eyes, he does at the same time possess an unquestioned humanity, and is clearly capable of showing affection towards others. True, Chaplin had demonstrated the multi-dimensionality of the Tramp many times prior to this film, but never, I believe, quite on this level; although never mean-spirited, the Tramp can still be quite outrageous to his surroundings, and sometimes prone to take advantage of others. Yet, he is also generally well-intentioned, and this soft spot is made all the more evident after acquainting the Gamine; the chemistry between Chaplin and Paulette Goddard may explain, in part, why the Tramp turns into such a full- fledged personality in this film.The seed of MODERN TIMES is reported to have occurred in Chaplin's mind after the comedian was invited to Henry Ford's factories. Although quite certainly invited due to his celebrity status, Chaplin turned out to be more shocked than impressed. Prior to his visit, Chaplin had recently returned from a year-long world tour, and actually considered retiring from making movies; one major reason being that he felt uncertain as to whether he'd be able to enter the world of talking films. His first production completed after the talkie revolution, CITY LIGHTS, had been a huge hit despite being essentially a silent, but Chaplin felt far from convinced that he could sustain his popularity at a time when not only Hollywood, but the whole world had long since greeted synchronized sound on film with open arms. He finally decided to gamble on yet another silent production, albeit with a soundtrack and a few instances of audible talking now and then, not spoken by the Tramp but used whenever devises such as radio were required for in the film.The result is one of Chaplin's finest films. Although often considered a satire, the Tramp and the Gamine display a tenderness into the film which assures that the more thought- provoking moments never appear truly dark or depressing. The Tramp struggles to survive with the Gamine much as he had done with Jackie Coogan in THE KID; however, this instance is interesting in particular because it is Chaplin's very leading lady who is made into his partner for survival. The Tramp is finally united with a woman who is struck at the same level in society as himself. Although we are reminded several times throughout the film that their relationship is not really romantic, but rather has the feel of a sort of friendship, it makes for a fascinating contrast to Chaplin's previous feature films, where the leading lady to a larger degree had functioned as a vessel to the story.Besides Chaplin's ability to make us truly care about the Tramp and the Gamine, MODERN TIMES is also very arguably the comedian's funniest film. One highlight occurs early on in, while the Tramp is still employed in the factory, and chosen as a guinea pig in order to demonstrate a time-sparing feeding machine. Inevitably, the invention turns out to be disastrous. So much time is spent on installing and repairing it that even a truly slow eater would be more effective. I've seen this sequence a countless number of times by now, but I'm still likely to lose my breath with laughter upon the next viewing. The feeding-machine is a great example of how Chaplin never abandoned a good idea; in his memoirs, he claims that the idea had occurred to him some twenty years before, when he'd briefly considered making a science-fiction comedy. Other obvious highlights include when Chester Conklin is served lunch by the Tramp while being hopelessly stuck in the machinery, or the Tramp's famous Nonsense Song towards the end. However, one should note that many of Chaplin's funniest moments include the small things which one might miss at first; such as when the Tramp, in a daydream he's sharing with the Gamine, with a solemn and proud expression picks a fruit from a tree, only to be told that dinner is served, whereupon he indifferently kicks it away!No doubt about it; MODERN TIMES is still hilarious and touching after all these years. One question hard to ignore, of course, is whether the satire on the industrial world still holds up; I do not quite share Stan Laurel's opinion that Chaplin made this film solely for the sake of comedy, though the plot's potential for great gags was obviously a major motivation. My own response is that yes, also as a satire MODERN TIMES definitely stands the test of time. Do keep in mind that the design of the factories in this film were likely seen as ridiculous exaggerations also in the 1930s; thus, it may not be too difficult to accept these as abstractions still able to get a point across to audiences of today. The essence of the madness which Chaplin portrays in these factories is highly recognizable. In my opinion, Chaplin does not so much criticize technology in itself; indeed, we are also presented here with examples on how technology has made everyday life more comfortable for many, as seen in the Tramp's daydream. As Chaplin himself experienced great poverty during much of his childhood, he likely recognized this. What rather was on Chaplin's mind, may have been how the employees at the factory were treated as part of the machinery. This may not have been that much of an original idea; but Chaplin's ability to make humor out of it, quite definitely demonstrates his uniqueness.By Chaplin's standards, MODERN TIMES was not such a huge financial hit; it made less money than his previous features, and reviews were mixed. Thankfully, today it is rightfully considered by most to be a masterpiece, and it provides several of Chaplin's most iconic moments.
