Throughout his unfortunately not-so-successful (financially) career, he made a string of remarkable pictures that changed cinema overseas rather than in his own country. But what many people miss, I think, is how varied he was in his talents and tastes, and the way he dipped the tone of his pictures from one end of his career to the other. Look at his early pictures such as Yojimbo, which more or less glorified violence and then look at his later ones such as the marvelously artistic Kagemusha and Ran, in which there is no atmospheric similarity.Ran is loosely based on the Shakespeare classic King Lear, which I have had the pleasure to read. Combining elements of the play with some Japanese legends and myths, Kurosawa weaved a terrific story that not only exposed violence as harrowing and gut-wrenching, but made us ask a question Why do human beings kill each other? The answer was not definitive, but it was clear for petty reasons. In the picture, an aging tyrant (Tatsuya Nakadai) divides his kingdom amongst his three ambitious sons and the two corrupt ones turn against him. Banished by his own flesh and blood, the tyrant is forced to live like an animal in the wilderness while his one noble son attempts to save him, and along the way, looses his wits and comes to terms with the horrible things that he did to gain his kingdom.There's a substantial different between King Lear and Lord Hidetora. Lear, as far as we know, was innocent and not worthy of having his daughters turn against him. Hidetora, by contrast, deserves it. Instead of retiring peacefully, he sees the monster that he was in youth. And what's brilliant is that Kurosawa decides not to flash back and show us the horrible things he did, the kingdoms he burned, but to tell us through other characters and see Hidetora react to them. The key character in this is Lady Kaede (Mieko Harada), wife of one of Hidetora's sons, who is so cold-blooded and vicious that she makes Lady Macbeth seem as pleasant as the girl nextdoor. Harada is utterly brilliant as this vengeful psychopath, who is worked into one of the screen's most detestable villains. Every time she appears on screen, the audience (and the scene) grows silent, waiting in fear of what she's about to do. She's like a cobra, gliding along with his silk gown dragging behind her, hissing, posed to strike at any time. Her key to her viciousness is not witty dialogue (though she has that) but her silence.And the violence theme. Kurosawa painted a field red with blood in the climax of Kagemusha, but as he put it, Kagemusha was a dress rehearsable in comparison to Ran. It's not just that Kurosawa paints the sets with blood, but that he makes it look horrible and frightening and dehumanizing. He exposes it as it is. And he reminds us that this is all for a petty reason. Hidetora murdered and pilaged to expand his territory so he could own more. Now he watches his sons murder before him, so they can spite him. There's a famous scene where Kurosawa shows a bloody massacre and shuts off all sound except for a music. It's like watching a silent movie and it has twice the impact it would have had had Kurosawa decided to mix in gunshots and screams and killings. Some of the killings look more like accidents on the set so well-done that they look as though they couldn't have been simulated. The montage is gruesome and deliberately exacerbated with one chilling killing after another and not one bit of it is glorified or even cannily familiar to what Kurosawa had shown in Yojimbo, which though a fantastic picture, was child's play compared to Ran.Ran is not only a strong picture in its morality and story and theme, but it's also a professionally-made one with Kurosawa at his peak form. The movie looks beautiful with gorgeous cinematography. Kurosawa shot most of the movie in wide-angle, with very few close-ups, even in emotional ones. In my opinion, he did this to show as much of the landscape as possible, perhaps to remind us that all of this was happening because of the land these people are spilling blood over.There is so much I want to say about Ran, unfortunately I have a 1000-word limit on IMDb, so I have to cut it short. But I think my point is made. Ran is one of the milestones of cinema, and perhaps Kurosawa's most impacting picture and one of his very best. Even in his seventies, going blind, and without much financial backing, he made a heck of a movie.

It is dark yes, but it is very poignant and heart warming as well. I never fail to tear up during the song Somewhere Out There, marvel at the beautiful animation or while the story is admittedly slow it is a beautiful and engrossing one. This sequel is a perfect example of a sequel that is worth watching. In most ways it isn't quite as good as the original, though there are one or two improvements along the way too. It has its flaws, but it is better than the dreadful Secret of NIMH 2Timmy To The Rescue and the mediocre-but-watchable All Dogs Go To Heaven 2. Also it is one of the better animated sequels out there, and considering how disappointing some of them have been that is saying a lot.My only real problems with the film are that the plot is a little too episodic, and that the film is too short, if anything it could've done with being 5-10 minutes longer. These aside, I liked the fact the story is cheerier and more fast paced. The animation is not that bad at all, it is colourful and well drawn on the whole, and the editing was above decent. Also the musical numbers are very good here. No, not as good as the ones in the original, and even if they did that is an extremely hard task to come by considering how stunning the music in the original was. Dreams to Dream says it all, that song alone pretty much equals the greatness of Somewhere Out There. The Girl I Left Behind is another standout I just loved how upbeat it was. And I would also like to remark that I thought the singing was better here than it was in the original. One of the minor flaws I had with the first film was that I did not like Phillip Glasser's singing voice, I just found it whiny and out of tune. Back to the sequel, Cathy Cavadini does a great job both voicing and singing Tanya, and Linda Ronstadt completely blew me away with her rendition of Dreams to Dream.What made the movie though was the voice acting. There was some truly inspired casting, and all involved did wonderfully. Phillip Glasser is still sweet and likable as Fieval, and Dom DeLuise is absolutely hilarious as Tiger and I loved it that Tiger has more to do here. There is one part when he falls into the sea and he comes eye to eye with a fish, and he says rather flatly Dogfish. John Cleese clearly relishes his role as the villain Cat R. Waul, a villain I preferred over Warren T.Rat, he could be sinister yet funny as well. But the biggest surprise was Jimmy Stewart as Wylie Burp, Stewart was a great actor, evident in films like Vertigo, It's a Wonderful Life and Rear Window, all classics in my opinion, and he proves once more how talented he was voicing a smaller but wholly relevant character and making the most of witty and sardonic lines.

An exciting sword and sorcery, or rather sword and sandal adventure set in an old age of magic and monsters. The story is a simple but epic one, There is a boy named Conan, whose father teaches him of the power of steel, and how only in his sword he can trust more than any man, woman, or beast. Shotly after, his village is invaded and his family killed by a the evil sorcerer Thulsa Doom and a small army of raiders. The children are taken away and forced to push a gigantic wheel. Years later, we see that only one has survived, a fully grown Conan. Conan is taken away to fight as a pit fighter, learn swordsmanship and language. Eventually, with the help of a couple of thieves, he embarks on a quest to defeat Thulsa Doom. There is so much I love about this movie, the story is pretty simple, but the magnitude is fantastic, it really feels like an ancient legend come to life. There is actually less dialogue than one would expect and much of the story is told through narration, we see the characters develop and come to understand them by their actions, and it's this kind of subtlety that makes it so great. This is a great example of visual storytelling, combining the narration and imagery to give the feeling of reading a book.The performances really drive the film, Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance as Conan is perfect, he has little dialogue but you just see his emotion in his eyes and feel what he feels. His character goes through several interesting phases, we first see him as a child learning from his father, as an adult we see how detached he is as he becomes a killing machine deriving satisfaction from victorious bloodshed and the sexual pleasure of women. Later he turns to thievery, falls in love with a beautiful woman and succumbs to hedonism and becomes, literally, drunk with excess. However he and his fellow adventurers are paid to rescue an old king's daughter from Thulsa Doom, which Conan sees as an opportunity to avenge his family's murder. Conan eventually becomes cold-hearted and driven by his desire for revenge but still is a very human character. The gorgeous Sandahl Bergman plays Conan's lover Valeria, a strong and likable heroine who actually gets a bit less screen time than she deserved. Then there's Conan's thief sidekick Subotai played by surfer Gerry Lopez, another great supporting character. The extremely talented Mako not only provides the excellent narration but plays an eccentric wizard who is actually one my favorite characters. James Earl Jones brings a great menacing presence to Thulsa Doom, a tyrannical sorcerer and cult leader with great hypnotic influence on the masses and the power to turn into a snake, a weird scene but unsurprising as this is his motif, he even had a pet snake which Conan fights in the movie.Also, Max Von Sydow makes a brief but memorable appearance as King Osric, who has Conan rescue his daughter from Thulsa Doom. Perhaps the greatest strengths of the movie lie in it's visuals and atmosphere. The cinematography is stunning and captures the beauty and brutality of this ancient world, from the icy mountains to the scorching desert to the palace of the villain. The settings and production design are fantastic and look what one would expect of such a barbaric time period. The castles and palaces made of stone and sometimes buildings of wood in a world that seems to echo an ancient Europe and even Biblical times in western Asia. The clothing of characters enforce this as well, warriors clad in armor and fur cloaks or the villainous black robes of the villains. The battle sequences are amazing to watch, grand sword-fights and brutal gladiatorial fights. The orchestral score of Basil Poledouris is half of what makes this so great, it's so rich and epic and enforces the emotion and context of every scene, humorous, happy, exciting, romantic, sad, dark, and haunting. Overall, this is one of those movies that I totally enjoyed and I recommend it, though I will warn that there is lots of graphic violence, strong sexual content and some frightening scenes, this is a fantasy film aimed specifically at teenagers and adults and I think more of a guy flick. It's epic, it's stylish, it's action packed, it's fun and very memorable.

His character goes through several interesting phases, we first see him as a child learning from his father, as an adult we see how detached he is as he becomes a killing machine deriving satisfaction from victorious bloodshed and the sexual pleasure of women. Later he turns to thievery, falls in love with a beautiful woman and succumbs to hedonism and becomes, literally, drunk with excess. However he and his fellow adventurers are paid to rescue an old king's daughter from Thulsa Doom, which Conan sees as an opportunity to avenge his family's murder. Conan eventually becomes cold-hearted and driven by his desire for revenge but still is a very human character. The gorgeous Sandahl Bergman plays Conan's lover Valeria, a strong and likable heroine who actually gets a bit less screen time than she deserved. Then there's Conan's thief sidekick Subotai played by surfer Gerry Lopez, another great supporting character. The extremely talented Mako not only provides the excellent narration but plays an eccentric wizard who is actually one my favorite characters. James Earl Jones brings a great menacing presence to Thulsa Doom, a tyrannical sorcerer and cult leader with great hypnotic influence on the masses and the power to turn into a snake, a weird scene but unsurprising as this is his motif, he even had a pet snake which Conan fights in the movie.Also, Max Von Sydow makes a brief but memorable appearance as King Osric, who has Conan rescue his daughter from Thulsa Doom. Perhaps the greatest strengths of the movie lie in it's visuals and atmosphere. The cinematography is stunning and captures the beauty and brutality of this ancient world, from the icy mountains to the scorching desert to the palace of the villain. The settings and production design are fantastic and look what one would expect of such a barbaric time period. The castles and palaces made of stone and sometimes buildings of wood in a world that seems to echo an ancient Europe and even Biblical times in western Asia. The clothing of characters enforce this as well, warriors clad in armor and fur cloaks or the villainous black robes of the villains. The battle sequences are amazing to watch, grand sword-fights and brutal gladiatorial fights. The orchestral score of Basil Poledouris is half of what makes this so great, it's so rich and epic and enforces the emotion and context of every scene, humorous, happy, exciting, romantic, sad, dark, and haunting. Overall, this is one of those movies that I totally enjoyed and I recommend it, though I will warn that there is lots of graphic violence, strong sexual content and some frightening scenes, this is a fantasy film aimed specifically at teenagers and adults and I think more of a guy flick. It's epic, it's stylish, it's action packed, it's fun and very memorable.

An exciting sword and sorcery, or rather sword and sandal adventure set in an old age of magic and monsters. The story is a simple but epic one, There is a boy named Conan, whose father teaches him of the power of steel, and how only in his sword he can trust more than any man, woman, or beast. Shotly after, his village is invaded and his family killed by a the evil sorcerer Thulsa Doom and a small army of raiders. The children are taken away and forced to push a gigantic wheel. Years later, we see that only one has survived, a fully grown Conan. Conan is taken away to fight as a pit fighter, learn swordsmanship and language. Eventually, with the help of a couple of thieves, he embarks on a quest to defeat Thulsa Doom. There is so much I love about this movie, the story is pretty simple, but the magnitude is fantastic, it really feels like an ancient legend come to life.

Throne of Blood (Macbeth) by Akira Kurosawa is one of my all time favorite movies and it's not even in English. As far as Romeo and Juliet go, I had just seen the Maryland Shakespeare Festival do a really nice job with this play which I thoroughly enjoyed. So I had fairly high expectations going into Franco Zeffirelli's version, especially after seeing such a high rating on IMDb, and not to mention the fact that it was so popular. First I want to say, the costumes and Italian setting were some of the best I'd ever seen. And the score was stunning. But as far as the movie itself? I hate to say it, but other then Olivia Hussey as Juliet and Pat Heywood the Nurse, (And sometimes the Friar), I thought the acting was stiff and completely unbelievable. Every time Romeo entered the screen I could almost hear Franco Zeffirelli telling him Okay' bring your eyebrows together and look pensive. Now do it again. More with the eyebrows' more pensive. Again. Again. CUT! And then there's Mercutio, who is suppose to be the dirty joke telling 16(?) year old, slightly older friend that goads Romeo to get in trouble, but will always be there when needed. But no, Zeffirelli's Mercutio was just plain annoying and spastic with no personality. Also they edited out his best (dirty) lines in essence nurturing him. And Romeo with his Waxy pensive looks, you know how they wore those hose stockings in the Middle Ages? Well' Every time the orchestrated musical score would start to soar (Beautifully mind you), and Romeo would give his pensive dreamy look wearing what looked like ballet tights, I swear I thought they were going to break out into a ballet with Romeo pirouetting across the screen. Speaking of Romeo. If you read the play he's a flighty, hormone driven 14 year old boy. How do we know this? Well right from the start of the play we learn that Juliet was NOT the love of his life, it was Rosaline. Yes' Rosaline, who we learn from Romeo's lips is The all-seeing sun, ne'er saw her match since first the world begun. So in reality Romeo is fickle. Romeo has the wandering eye. Romeo is acting like a 14 year old, and looking to fall in love&#x85; Again. Yet Zeffrelli adds Rosaline to the story with a couple throw away lines pronounced by the Friar in the middle of the movie. Now what about Mercutio's role in Romeos romances in the play as compared to the movie? He's the big brother there to both tease and teach. He's the cool guy with the heart of gold.I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh And the demesnes (regions) that there adjacent lie. &#x96; MercutioThen there's Olivia Hussy's Juliet. She made the movie, even if there were times she laid it on a bit thick. Still' She came across in every scene as beautiful, innocent, and honest. The first time she sees Romeo at the dance Olivia Hussy's eyes glowed with honest emotion, you could believe she was truly experiencing love at first site. Still, Zeffirelli managed to cut some of Juliet's best lines. When she's about to drink the drought that the Friar has given her to put her into a death like sleep, what does she say in Zeffirelli's version? Love give me strength&#x85;Gulp. Very short and to the point. Shakespeare gave her some amazing lines here, and instead Zeffirelli give's us the Reader's Digest version (Gulp).Here's what Juliet is really thinking when she sips the potionWhat if it be a poison, which the friar Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead, Lest in this marriage he should be dishonored, Because he married me before to Romeo? I fear it is and yet, methinks, it should not, For he hath still been tried a holy man. How if, when I am laid into the tomb, I wake before the time that Romeo Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point! Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault, To whose foul mouth no health-some air breathes in, And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?

And madly play with my forefather's joints? And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud? And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone, As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?

That said, being British and a lover of cricket, I think I'm safe in saying it will be a long time before Hollywood makes a cricket movie, let alone a cricket \/ sex farce! I wasn't even aware there were such things as baseball-groupies or Annie's as I believe they're called but as ball-game slappers go, it has to be said that Susan Sarandon's Annie Savoy and her young sidekick Millie, certainly offer an understandable come-hither attraction to the dumb grunts who make up the baseball team's ranks.The acting by the A-list cast is very good, Sarandon in particular scoring (no pun intended) as the inexhaustible, Durham Bulls fan with a novel way to bring on young talent in the team, well supported by a a very young looking Tim Robbins as her number one draft pick this particular year and Kevin Costner as the seen-it-all-before old lag who arrives to encourage Robbins' character in more traditional manner but who likewise falls for Annie's charms and ends up competing with his protégé for the squiring rights.Like I said, a lot of the baseball terminology and action pretty much passed me by, although I did enjoy Costner's universal roll-call of sporting clichés to Robbins for his first major television interview.

The mood is appropriately foreboding throughout, and I've never seen another actor in my life that could so perfectly portray Damien as Jonathan Scott-Taylor---he was BORN to play Damien!! This is one of the first truly creepy movies I saw as a kid. It's fascinating to see the opulence in which Damien is raised and how he still feels empty in spite of it, knowing he is part of something bigger that hasn't been revealed. This is especially well conveyed in the lake house scenes where everyone is happy for Damien's brother's birthday on what should have been an ideal vacation as enjoyed by a privileged class, yet Damien knows something is......wrong. He still feels only emptiness, loneliness. I also enjoyed the sense of sheer dread in the elevator scene and the cackling raven in the roadside scene. You absolutely MUST watch the original Omen movie before this one, it is essential to the storyline and even better than this superior film. Unfortunately, Omen III totally dropped the ball and left a hideous black mark on the series.

It's about a strange lonely woman who rents floating fish huts for people to sleep in. In addition to food and coffee she also provides sexual services for the men.The story gets going when a retired policeman, who has murdered his girlfriend arrives to the place of floating huts. A strange romantic relationship build between these two loners and sex becomes a drug for them - a medicine to mental and physical injuries.An important theme of the movie is fishing, in my opinion Ki-Duk compares fishing to relationships; you need bait to lure the catch, just as one example. The movie analyzes love and relationships do they always end up to a disaster or can they save a human's life. I'm sure I will come back to this film, because of its several layers.There's not much of a dialog in this film, which to my mind is good. Because it's the reason why this movie is so capturing and it shows the visual skills of Ki-Duk Kim. Of course there is also always a reason to choose the quiet way, for the Belgian Dardenne brothers it is film-philosophy for Ki-Duk it is probably the style of narrative, but also the thing what silence does to the observation of the viewer.The thing that bothers me with this film is the abuse of animals. I don't know whether the scenes were real or faked, but anyways they were pretty nasty. I can watch almost anything (Le Sang Des Betes), but it just doesn't feel right. Even that the scenes were important for the film - Ki-Duk's symbolicism.So get ready for something a little different, something disturbing and yet so interesting. I wouldn't recommend this to the most sensitive viewers because it has a lot of brutal and violent scenes. Set your mind ready for some symbolism and good extraordinary narrative.

But by him doing this it makes her realize how much she loves writing for the paper. I like that at the end of the movie they almost end up going to jail because they were hiding a fugitive. But as this happens they find out that the mayor and sheriff were suppose to let this man go cause they got papers that said so and they didn't want anything to do with it. So they end up not going to jail but at the end they had a great story to write about in the paper. Hildy ends up getting back with Walter.

I liked every single one of his movies made from Jaws to the latest Indiana Jones. This is no exception. This is a classic science fiction film that has a sense of awe. This picture really is the godfather of science fiction. If this film was never made, I'm sure that sci-fi movies would suck in today's age.This film stars Richard Dreyfuss who was previously in Jaws. Basically, his mission is to find out what's going on with the appearance of UFO's and airplanes that have been missing since 1945 even if that means getting in the way of the government.As I said before, this film is a beauty. It's not perfect, but it's close. John Williams is my favorite all-time composer and he has another perfect score under his belt. I also loved all the set designs of the film. This is an amazing film. I rate this film 9\/10.

It was late and we'd been drinking and we thought it would be fun to watch it and rip it apart.The movie, in simplest form, is about a Police officer (Tom Selleck) who specializes in robots that are malfunctioning. Soon he finds killer robots and a mad man programming these robots to do his evil deeds.Although it isn't a great movie it wasn't quite bad enough to be a good movie to sit and make fun of such as Manos, The Room or any number of films featured on Mystery Science Theater. It had some bad dialog but nothing too ridiculous, and the acting wasn't as bad as I was expecting. The only things that were really worth making fun of were the crazed robots and of course Gene Simmons character. Not saying those are the only bad things about the movie, just the only things that are really fodder for jokes.All the bad things aside it was pulled off decently for what it was, (an 80s futuristic thriller) it just didn't have the excitement or tension it take to keep you wanting more or even wanting what's left.Overall pretty boring and worth a pass unless you're a hardcore Selleck fan.

It's well made, it's well written, and it's provocative. It's not the kind of film you turn on on a Saturday night for some fun, but if you like film, you must watch this. But I warn you, it's R rated for a reason. I guess the expression can you handle the real world? really makes sense in this movie.
