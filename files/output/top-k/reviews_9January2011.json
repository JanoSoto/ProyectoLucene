Feel free to jump inside of the head of John Malkovich.This is a crazy film, and the worst thing to do to a crazy film is to reveal too much of the plot. It starts off with a struggling puppeteer named Craig Schwartz who finds an advertisement in the newspaper for a man with very fast fingers. As he is used to working with his hands, this is the perfect job opportunity for him. On the first day of work, he finds that his office building is located on the 7 ½ floor (which can only be opened when the elevator is stopped between the 7th and 8th floor and a metal wrench is inserted into the doors of the elevator.)

Probably very appropriate for the film I saw, I saw it because of the most superficial reason imaginable.

It's easy to react to Breathless but I decided I wouldn't play into it, even a film by my nemesis deserves better.First thing I noticed and prepared myself to dislike is that Breathless doesn't feel important things, it says them. It's a film of outward appearances. But Belmondo doesn't just look into a photo of Humphrey Bogart, he looks into a mirror and hopes to see a reflection of himself, and Jean Seberg doesn't just look like Rita Hayworth in The Lady from Shangai, she behaves like a movie star, they both do and the movie behaves like a movie. This not just the skewed reflection of a Monogram potboiler, it's the image that wants to look into the mirror of Hollywood but not see the reflection. It wants another one for itself, Godard creates this. What perfunctory gangster plot there is to the film is a meaningless boyhood fantasy.This is okay for me but there were films aware of themselves before Breathless just like there was New Wave before Godard. What intrigues me here is the breach with visual narrative, how the Eiffel tower is not established, it's seen passingly through the glass of a moving car. And more, that the film seems to gradually become aware that a certain kind of story is being played out in it and begins to spot the anomaly. Flashing signs in the street tell us that Michel Poiccard's arrest is imminent and the protagonists read about it from the newspaper. It's like the movie is pointing out to itself the presence of story while it's preoccupied with something entirely different.But I'm not sure the film is even about that, if Godard is aware of the meta-narrative. As some of the myopic criticism of the film I read points out, Breathless is silly, pretentious, about nothing. A couple of instances of dialogue made me groan, but what I take from it is that Breathless is a youth film that does not address youth after the fact, it's made by them, in their image. Michel and Patricia are silly because they're young, they pretend, rebel or conform, make sweeping judgements on love and death, they make faces or look under skirts, and whether Godard means it or not, he expresses himself as a young artist. There's pretension in that but it's the time to be pretentious.

After impressing his professors Nash get to work at MIT and advices the Pentagon on code breaking. He is recruited by William Parcher (Ed Harris), an intelligence agent for the CIA. Parcher tells Nash of a plot by the Soviet to blow up a nuclear bomb on US soil and communicate with their sleepers through codes in magazines. Nash forms a relationship with a beautiful woman, Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), but as he becomes more paranoid, Nash view of reality is altered.A Beautiful Mind is a slow burning type of film, where the story and the character development is built over time. It is a serious drama that was designed as an actors film. And the actor was really good and that is what you would except from this cast. Crowe was really good and it was believed he lost the Oscar because of his outer acting activities. I really like Jennifer Connelly as an actress and she has shown talent in her roles the highlight of her performance was when her relationship with Nash starts to break down and flex her acting muscles. Paul Bettany is another actor I really like and his role was to add a little comic relief to the film. And Ed Harris was able to give a more sinister performance, a little like his role in The Truman Show. He is also a little like the spies in The Good Shepherd, even dressing the same.A Beautiful Mind is a film about mental issues, a subject that is hard to be put onto screen because it is an internal issue and people experience it differently. But Howard does his best to visualise it, with Nash hallucinating events, seeing numbers and patterns and codes jump out from the pages. It was when the film truly comes to life when it is relieved that Nash is delusional and how his mind made up its own form of reality.But reading Nash's real story there was some even more strange behaviour. One example was because of his paranoid that he tried to flee America and renounce his American citizenship. Or when he was delusional he when on anti-Semitic rants blaming Jews for World Communism.

Directed by Bill Duke, Sister Act 2 Back in the Habit tries to introduce a few new elements into the familiar premise, some of them successful, others not.Some time after the events of the first movie, Deloris Van Cartier (still played by Whoopi Goldberg) has returned to lounge singing and headlines a popular show in Las Vegas. When her old friends from the nun convent pay her a visit and ask her to help them with their work at a financially struggling high school, she cannot let them down and agrees to become the school's new music teacher. The students are unruly, the administrator Mr. Crisp (James Coburn) is uptight and the school is under risk of being closed down but luckily Deloris (a.k.a. Sister Mary Clarence) knows that the power of music is never to be underestimated.The movie starts energetically with one of Deloris' Vegas performances that catchily recounts the events of the previous movie. It is also pleasant to see that Wendy Makkena, Kathy Najimy and Maggie Smith return in the roles of Deloris' fellow nuns and that this time there are also monks present among the school's staff. Contrary to the first movie that dealt more with the other nuns, this time the comedy is for the most part based on Deloris' interaction with her new rebellious students who prefer freestyle rapping to gospel choirs. I wonder if rap music had more of a novelty value in mainstream entertainment in 1993 than it does in 2011 because seeing it now, I was left hoping for more actual songs instead of brief sessions of verbal rhyme battles and tough talking.During the latter half the music finally gets going and we hear fun songs like the funky Get Up Offa That Thing \/ Dancing in the Street and the final choir performances (Joyful, Joyful) near the end. The end credit version of Ain't No Mountain High Enough performed by various cast members all together belongs among the most entertaining moments of the film as well. However, the movie is not really a musical and should also be judged by merits other than the soundtrack. On this front it is not very successful, in my opinion. The plot is extremely predictable, the noisy kids are annoying and the funniest characters (like the eccentric monks) are not paid enough attention. Fans of Lauryn Hill will surely be interested in her breakthrough performance as a young discouraged singer Rita Watson but I was not too big a fan of the ballads she sings here. More cheery songs like the first movie's Shout are what Sister Act 2 would have needed.Setting the plot in a school makes sure the story does not repeat the first movie's ideas too obviously but I wish they had used the different environment for something less predictable than just another tale of a new teacher cleaning up a rundown school by inspiring troubled kids to believe in themselves. I guess that if you absolutely loved the first movie, there is no reason why you would not like the sequel too (at least moderately) but generally speaking, I do not think Sister Act 2 is very good film. It seriously lacks the will to deviate from the tried and true patterns of comedy conventions and failed to make me laugh or even smile, unlike the original film that featured better songs and antagonists. You might as well save your time and watch the music clips on YouTube or something; the rest is pretty skippable.

In 1984 after becoming quite famous in Europe Wim Wenders went to America to produce his first film outside of Germany. Paris, Texas is a masterful road-movie, which was Wenders' favorite genre; he even made a road-movie trilogy in 1970's (Alice in the Cities, False Movement and In the Course of Time). This slow-paced, mature, one of the director's most acclaimed films and his most accessible film, requires heart, certain maturity and patience from its viewer.A quiet man, lost for four years walks in the desert, due to dehydration a man picks him up and takes him to a hospital. Soon the quiet man is taken in by his brother. Later on the man tries to put his life back together and remember what happened between him, his wife and, his 8-year-old son.Paris, Texas could easily be a film which makes one to die for a ticket to the States. The landscapes, the gorgeous images reinforced by sentimental and honest music make us see into the true soul of America. 1980's and Americanism can be seen everywhere in the film, it is cleverly and precisely created cokes, sodas, American cars, country music, clothes and landscapes. The construction of state in Paris, Texas is incredibly well handled and the contrasts Wenders has created are astonishing.This profound film about a quiet man, lost woman and the unification of a disintegrated family really drills down to pure emotion. Difficulty of communication and losing one's identity have both been very important themes for Wim Wenders already in Im lauf der zeit (1976). In Im lauf der zeit the two men don't know how to talk to each other, how to talk about your worries, memories and past. But in Paris, Texas the theme of difficulty of communication was taken to a new level what can you say to the people you once left behind? How can you ever make up the mistakes once made? It's about the impossibility of understanding others, how can you relate to a person with completely different emotions. The change of identity is a scary thing and this theme culminates in the scene where Travis (the quiet man) tries different kind of outfits, trying to find the right suit for his new identity.Alongside with the themes of identity and communication, Paris, Texas is an emotional film about loneliness. The difficulty of understanding and empathy. Perhaps Travis can't make up the mistakes he once made and he is alone. He finds his long lost son and his wife, but understands that he's unable to live with them and is once again left alone, lonelier than ever before. Paris, Texas is a timeless film about loneliness and the later film by Wenders Wings of Desire (1987) can easily be seen as an antithesis for it; it has got certain eras, ages and a history. This profound theme of loneliness culminates in the unforgettable images of men sitting, standing and walking alone in Paris, Texas.In the end Paris, Texas grows out to be a mature film about family, the disintegration and the unification of it. It's a smooth and quality film in style, thematics and content. The delimitations and states are important and full of significance. After seeing the film twice I consider it as a very touching, melancholy road-movie about soul-searching, identity and family. It's a very good film, even if it's not Wenders' finest. I strongly recommend people to get to know his earlier and later German production. Wings of Desire (1987) and In the Course of Time (1976) are for instance two unforgettable masterpieces.

I just wish this small-time genre picture had been made at a little higher quality. After an attempt to film The Last Temptation of Christ in 1983 failed, Scorsese turned to smaller pictures made at lower budgets in order to get clout with studios. In 1985, he released After Hours, a strange, weirdly entertaining film of one man's wild and crazy night in Soho, New York. The Color of Money couldn't be more different in tone or style, yet it isn't able to conjure up the same energy or driving force After Hours did.What does work in The Color of Money is the acting. Paul Newman, a legend of the silver screen, reprises his role as Fast Eddie Felson who is now 25 years older and comes across a young pool player that revives the competitive spirit in him. The player is Vincent, an extremely cocky and self-aware young man with a gorgeous yet somewhat detached girlfriend, Carmen. Tom Cruise is perfectly cast as Vincent, able to capture every amount of arrogance and superiority a young, successful player would have. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is wonderful as well; beautiful, mysterious and with a subtle underside to her character that gives her more of an edge than the main characters.This, in turn, becomes one of the main problems of the film. What the screenplay lacks is an intriguing setup between Newman and Cruise. Here we have two bonafide stars of the screen, yet it becomes rather obvious what is going to happen in nearly every single scene between them. The generation gap as well as the differing personalities creates such a predictable conflict that the film loses much of its suspense and edge. Another problem is the flashy photography and editing tricks Scorsese utilizes in the pool scenes. More often than not, it probably would have been more effective to simply shoot it straight instead of trying to dress it up with so many effects and techniques. I understand why Scorsese did it this way, to draw in the large audiences to maintain his status. In the end, however, the final result doesn't add up to much of a great entertainment.

My earliest knowledge of Marcel Pagnol must have been a X'mas record something like Noel with the santons de Provence a beautiful X'mas tale a la Pagnol (ave l'acceng du midi qui n'en fini pas) yes with the French southern accent that seems to never end! I read here a comment about inappropriate subtitles, I must admit for this movie I felt highly privileged to understand French, French rural area and French accent. Definitely these 3 ingredient give again another dimension to this work and I would believe getting the appropriate subtitle to emulate the accent would be a phenomenal task. I guess four hours can be a little taxing on some, but like many have reported it's really worth it and I can only feel sorry for the few who are or will be displeased with such a master piece.

The two end up settling the dispute with a game of one on one, and Sidney wins (surprise!). As the winner, Sidney gets to have sex with Jennifer Lopez, while Billy is beaten senseless by mobsters.

It's a film that remains unknown to people who visit multiplexes on a Friday night to watch the latest blockbuster from Hollywood and is rarely shown on network television . I think its only broadcast on British television was on Channel 4 in 1990 or 1991 . Nevertheless it was well regarded enough to make it in to the the lower reaches of the IMDb Top 250 for a couple of years but I'm rather puzzled as to why ? It's not a film produced for the masses which possibly sums the up inherent irony of communism The story starts 20 years after a meteorite has landed on Earth and when people have started disappearing in the crash zone the authorities quarantine the area which is now referred to as  the Zone  . A trio of men sneak through the blockade determined to find out the secret of the Zone This is communist science fiction based upon a story written by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky . Communist science fiction differs quite markedly from its Western counterpart by concentrating on metaphysics , man's relationship to the natural order rather than plot driven concepts . In many ways it's introspective humanism rather than mind expanding and imaginative . This type of story would appeal well to Tarkovsky since his volume of wok centres around elemental imagery such as water and wind . He is a film maker who is the archetypal auteur The problem with all this is that it makes for a rather unengaging piece of cinema . If you're expecting to see aliens you'll be disappointed . There is an argument that science fiction doesn't need aliens in order to work and this is certainly true , think of the number of novels by people such as John Christopher that feature Earth shattering eco disasters for a premise . But if you had three men in Soviet Russia escaping in to a forbidden zone where they walk around discussing the human condition for three hours then you'd have the exact same story devoid of any science fiction heading . In short STALKER isn't really a science fiction film at all At least the film sets out its stall right from the very beginning . We're treated to the type of camera work seen in films by luminaries as Bela Tarr where the camera moves about for several minutes without cutting . We don't actually get any dialogue until ten minutes in to the running time and if you're bored senseless by then then it's perhaps a good idea to watch something else because the pace doesn't really improve much One of the comments on this page states that STALKER is  Like Last Of The Summer Wine set in Russia  and that's a very accurate description of the movie .

After seeing it I thought, well, the score is a Psycho rip off. And the effects used by Tom Savini are nice but I have seen him done much better, for example The Prowler. When we saw this flick 30 years ago it was at cinema or at home, cinema didn't show the best quality then and televisions were small and it was broadcasted. Today it's all digital and we watch our flicks on much better screens. And there you can easily see the first killing how it was done (girl in the wood). Look at me arguing. It is still a hell of a movie. You just can't see the ending coming. The acting is superb. The use of score and camera is very well done and that for a movie that supposed to be a rip off of Halloween. There are much better flicks from the slasher era but this is one of the first to make a fuss and a lot of money and a franchise. A must see. But before I go, be sure to catch the Deluxe version, you know the ones with the 3D covers, only available in the US. There are some extras on it that you can't find anywhere else, not even on 'His Name Was Jason'. Also there is a kind of continuity on the DVD's. It's titled Lost Tales from Camp Blood Part 1, but it's really gory and sadly there's no Jason in it but it's well done as an extra. It clocks in around 6 minutes but it's really a nice piece to see.

Detective Kenichi Takabe (played by Kiyoshi Kurosawa's favourite actor Kôji Yakusho) is responsible for piecing this mind-warping puzzle together.Gritty, dark and immersed in shadows Cure is arguably the best serial killer thriller of the 90s alongside the much more widely recognised 7even. Initially a mysterious and captivating detective story unfolds into a dreaded voyage in the depths of the human soul. The amnesiac main antagonist constantly repeats the lingering question Who are you?. Well - who are you? What defines you? Which sides of your life are the real you? Initially the question seems simple and straightforward and only as we reach the culmination do we fully understand the diabolic depth of Kurosawa's script. Evil in this movie is almost like planting an inception. It isn't something surreal or given at birth, but something that is planted into seemingly normal people. The idea of murder is not the work of outside forces, but a gist, a phase, a thought. And as such the horrendous reality of this simple concept will grip you more than a devil possessing your soul. Simply because their is so much truth in the seemingly obvious discovery.And unforgettable experience, that you won't want to repeat anytime soon. The movie lingers with its confusing finale, but further analysis just makes you focus on the true meaning of what just transpired.

Even the murderers themselves are unconnected and to each case a different suspect is being held responsible. Detective Kenichi Takabe (played by Kiyoshi Kurosawa's favourite actor Kôji Yakusho) is responsible for piecing this mind-warping puzzle together.Gritty, dark and immersed in shadows Cure is arguably the best serial killer thriller of the 90s alongside the much more widely recognised 7even. Initially a mysterious and captivating detective story unfolds into a dreaded voyage in the depths of the human soul. The amnesiac main antagonist constantly repeats the lingering question Who are you?. Well - who are you? What defines you? Which sides of your life are the real you? Initially the question seems simple and straightforward and only as we reach the culmination do we fully understand the diabolic depth of Kurosawa's script. Evil in this movie is almost like planting an inception. It isn't something surreal or given at birth, but something that is planted into seemingly normal people. The idea of murder is not the work of outside forces, but a gist, a phase, a thought. And as such the horrendous reality of this simple concept will grip you more than a devil possessing your soul. Simply because their is so much truth in the seemingly obvious discovery.And unforgettable experience, that you won't want to repeat anytime soon. The movie lingers with its confusing finale, but further analysis just makes you focus on the true meaning of what just transpired. Like a psychiatric session gone awry it may be hard to quickly gather together after such a watch. Recommended watch following such a mind-numbing movie Any romantic comedy, that will loosen up your soul and is guaranteed to offer a happy end.Dark and profound this mesmerising story is not one that will quickly dissolve from your memory. Probably by far Kurosawa's best movie, which is fortunately devoid of skin-deep social commentary of most of his other movies. Recommended watch for any Asian movie fan.

Chris (later to be known as Izzy), is looked upon as a strong leader of his cover band but eventually his obsession with Steel Dragon (his favorite band)and unwillingness to alter the bands sound creates waves of dissatisfaction to his fellow band mates. After a confrontation over the seriousness and intention of playing cover songs, Chris was thought to be misdirected and was eventually kicked out of his own band. Things change, however, after two girls who make themselves out to be groupies, showed front man and lead guitarist Kurt Cunning his video performance. He auditions, he gets in and the rest is pretty simple.I cringed at the end when he would eventually reunite with the girl that he thought got away. I didn't expect this film to go to that region of cheese that you often see in big production films that are distributed by Warner Bros. It almost seems like the writers of the film had no experience and did not conduct interviews to grasp the detail of what life as a rock star really was about. It kept inquisitive guys like myself to prefer to have seen real video clips and interviews from some of the top selling bands of the 80's without the stereotypical and scrape off the top story. It became formulated and predictable to say the least, but the film still has a spark of charm as it relives all of our rock star fantasies that we had when we were kids.6\/10.

As the hatches of the U-boats open, hails of gunfire ricochets and hits the metal and soldiers. Many jump off the boat and into the water while the gunfire pierce through the water. Blood filled the ocean with dead soldiers dying. Loud screaming is heard as Captain John H. Miller arrives at the hellish beach with his eyes wide open. As he looks around him, soldiers are seen screaming and some are holding their lives on with fear while some finds out that their arms are shot off. Epic, pure epic. Saving Private Ryan is not a roller-coaster of action, it's triumph. It's a movie where you salute those who fought in Normandy on D-Day in World War II. Steven Spielberg delivers us the horrors, shock and amazement and triumph of World-War II since Schindler's List. I was amaze at what he brought to us. The sheer horror and amazement of World-War II is never forgotten. I have this movie on VHS, the Double Videocassette on DreamWorks, that shows the feature movie and the special edition of the movie. I also felt emotionally driven at the end when the older Private Ryan is seen looking at John H. Miller's cross and grave. He asks his wife if he was a good man and live a good life. After she answers Yes, the camera shows Ryan and his family family in the background. With triumph, he salute Miller's grave as the camera zooms in to shows the description of the grave. The last shot shows the American flag waving the sky. The film fades out. THAT is triumph and showing that American soldiers will never be forgotten. All in all, Saving Private Ryan is a epic war film that will never be forgotten and will be a war movie. ★★★★ 4 stars.
