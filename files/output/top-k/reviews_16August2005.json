It's über-weird and is filled with some fantastic visuals. No, this most certainly ain't a movie for just everyone but when you are a fan of these sort of movie's you'll absolutely adore this one as well.The movie has no dialog and is completely sung, which in my opinion makes it weird that Ann-Margret got an Oscar nomination and won a Golden Globe for her role in this movie. I don't know I just have something against actors receiving Oscar nominations or winning any other big movie award for playing a role in a musical movie. Musical acting and 'normal' movie acting are two totally different things that are totally on different levels and require a totally different approach. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that Ann-Margret was not good in this movie but receiving big movie awards and nominations for a musical role was just totally out of place.Person I enjoyed most in this movie was Oliver Reed. He seemed to be the only one who didn't took his role completely serious and he plays his part with lots of fun and joy. Also it was fantastic to see Jack Nicholson in a fairly big cameo appearance. The rest of the movie is filled with appearances of famous artists such as Tina Turner, Eric Clapton, Elton John and of course members of 'The Who'.I admit that I'm not the biggest musical fan around but I can appreciate the way this movie is made, both visually as well as musically. The movie is pretty weird and features lots of symbolism, that forms in a way a satire on religion. The movie is not as accessible as for instance the other well known rock-opera and in my opinion far superior Jesus Christ Superstar from 1973. Because this movie is not really accessible to everyone I find it hard whether or not to recommend this movie. Even though I thought the movie was just plain weird at times and I'm not the biggest fan of the music in the movie, I was still entertained by it and somehow also enjoyed watching it. So perhaps everyone should give this movie at least once a chance.7\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"16 August 2005","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This rock-opera is a cult camp-classic alright.

All I knew was that this was some kind of war movie from an unknown French director, with Andie MacDowell - not exactly my most favorite actress - and Adrien Brody - who was excellent in The Pianist, but who I didn't see play in any other movie since. Those aren't exactly strong reasons why I shouldn't miss it and yet I was willing to give it a try, probably because I hoped to be surprised by it. And that's exactly what it did.Harrison Lloyd is a photojournalist who has already won a Pulitzer price with his photographs of several wars. But he now has a wife and two children and he doesn't want to go to another war-zone anymore, because he is afraid that he might die while doing his job. He wants to change jobs, but his boss has given him one last assignment. He'll have to travel to ex-Yugoslavia, where the civil war has just started. What appears to be a small incident at first, quickly proves to be one of the most gruesome wars in recent history and it doesn't take long before Harrison is missing, presumably dead. But his wife Sarah refuses to believe that he's no longer alive and decides to go after him and to look for him. As she penetrates deeper into the war zone, she is confronted with all the horrors that were committed in this war random executions of soldiers and civilians, rape, snipers, the uncertainty of where and who the enemy is,...At first I must say that I didn't like this movie all too much. This seemed to be like yet another Hollywood product about a perfect and happy family who is all a sudden thorn apart by some unfortunate event, who learns to deal with the pain, building up a new life without the missing person and so on, and so on. Nothing new, nothing special. But then it all started to change... a lot. As soon as she is in ex-Yugoslavia, being confronted with all the horrors of that civil war, it was as if I was struck by lightening. Never have I seen so much realistic images in a movie about this war. This started to feel more like a documentary, rather than like a movie. It was all so incredibly realistic and I can't say that they have left anything out. Young children murdered and raped; soldiers and civilians, man and woman, old and young,... executed in front of your eyes; all the explosions and the attacks;... It seems like you're all witnessing it live, as if you are seeing it through the eyes and the lenses of the photojournalists yourself. It was incredible...The performances in this movie are more than OK and Andie MacDowell was a pleasant surprise in this one, although I must say that I liked her performance a lot more once she was the journalist in ex-Yugoslavia. Before that I sometimes found her acting a bit too much and quite unrealistic (take for instance the several scenes in which she is constantly falling when she hears bad news). I didn't really have the feeling that the wife of a war photographer, who constantly lives with this kind of uncertainty, would act and react the way she did. But as I said before, I forgot about that as soon as she was in Europe. However, the best performances in my opinion were those of Adrien Brody - who was excellent as the drug using, alcohol abusing and cynical Kyle Morris - and Brendan Gleeson as Marc Stevenson.In the end this is a very fine movie about the Yugoslavian civil war. It's too bad that the first part of the movie didn't convince me all that much, because in my opinion it wasn't all that strong, but overall I really liked what I saw. That's why I give this movie a well-deserved 7.5\/10.

As she penetrates deeper into the war zone, she is confronted with all the horrors that were committed in this war random executions of soldiers and civilians, rape, snipers, the uncertainty of where and who the enemy is,...At first I must say that I didn't like this movie all too much. This seemed to be like yet another Hollywood product about a perfect and happy family who is all a sudden thorn apart by some unfortunate event, who learns to deal with the pain, building up a new life without the missing person and so on, and so on.

As soon as she is in ex-Yugoslavia, being confronted with all the horrors of that civil war, it was as if I was struck by lightening. Never have I seen so much realistic images in a movie about this war. This started to feel more like a documentary, rather than like a movie. It was all so incredibly realistic and I can't say that they have left anything out. Young children murdered and raped; soldiers and civilians, man and woman, old and young,... executed in front of your eyes; all the explosions and the attacks;... It seems like you're all witnessing it live, as if you are seeing it through the eyes and the lenses of the photojournalists yourself. It was incredible...The performances in this movie are more than OK and Andie MacDowell was a pleasant surprise in this one, although I must say that I liked her performance a lot more once she was the journalist in ex-Yugoslavia. Before that I sometimes found her acting a bit too much and quite unrealistic (take for instance the several scenes in which she is constantly falling when she hears bad news). I didn't really have the feeling that the wife of a war photographer, who constantly lives with this kind of uncertainty, would act and react the way she did. But as I said before, I forgot about that as soon as she was in Europe. However, the best performances in my opinion were those of Adrien Brody - who was excellent as the drug using, alcohol abusing and cynical Kyle Morris - and Brendan Gleeson as Marc Stevenson.In the end this is a very fine movie about the Yugoslavian civil war. It's too bad that the first part of the movie didn't convince me all that much, because in my opinion it wasn't all that strong, but overall I really liked what I saw.

All I knew was that this was some kind of war movie from an unknown French director, with Andie MacDowell - not exactly my most favorite actress - and Adrien Brody - who was excellent in The Pianist, but who I didn't see play in any other movie since. Those aren't exactly strong reasons why I shouldn't miss it and yet I was willing to give it a try, probably because I hoped to be surprised by it.

But he now has a wife and two children and he doesn't want to go to another war-zone anymore, because he is afraid that he might die while doing his job.

I especially loved his Westerns and the Dirty Harry films. When The Dead Pool was released in 1988 I was at last old enough to go and see it in the cinema, so of course along I went to the cinema with my mates! A bonus was that I was a big fan of Guns n Roses when it came out and one of their songs Welcome to the Jungle was used heavily in the film, plus the band made cameo appearances in the movie but I would be lying if I said I noticed them first time round! Even future star Jim Carrey made an appearance credited as James Carrey, funnily enough he also had a blink and you'll miss him appearance in another Eastwood picture Pink Caddilack. Anyway as for the film itself, well it's no way near as good as the original but is arguably better than any of the other sequels. Clint breezes through the film and is at his best here. Liam Neeson is pretty good too although the story isn't particularly great to help them out. Evan Kim is a pretty bland partner for Harry and you are just waiting for him to get killed or ended up in hospital. The film has a great car chase sequence with a neat twist as a bonus! Also the music score is provided once again by Lalo Schifrin and as ever is great. All in all The Dead Pool is a very entertaining film which Dirty Harry or Eastwood fans will love, anyone else might find it a bit daft. A fitting send off for Harry Callahan and second only to the excellent original.

The movie makes too many jumps into time, basically almost every sequences are set months or even years apart of each other. To symbolizes this, Johnny Depp basically has a different haircut in almost literally every scene he is in, which sadly became a bit irritating after a while.

Whether you like her singing or not - who else sounds like Cher? Cher has definitely made her mark in the entertainment industry and will be remembered long after others have come and gone.

The father in the movie is a widower and a superb cook who has unfortunately begun to lose his sense of taste--needing to have his assistants taste his food to get the flavor right. Much of the movie centers on the love life of him as well as his daughters, as well as the older man's friendship with a cute neighbor girl and her mother.I loved this movie because the material was handled so gently and realistically--making you really care about most of the characters.

Just as poker games are often won with guns, bowling for money has hazards all its own, something I learned even as a junior bowler hustling games after the league on Saturday.Roy E. Munson (Woody Harrelson) is such a loser that acting like a total loser is actually called being Munsoned. The term is named after an incident where some victims of a bowling hustle relieve Roy of his right hand in a gruesome manner which involves bowling equipment. Somehow, even THAT manages to be funny, which speaks to the quality of this film, a film smart enough to have its three main stars on screen for most of the time. The 1979 accident was the result of Roy taking the fall for the hustle engineered by legendary bowler Ernie McCracken (Bill Murray).Fast forward to 1996, and Roy stumbles across an Amish bowler named Ishmael Boorg (Randy Quaid), the most talented bowler he's ever come across. He offers to coach Ishmael for a $1 million tournament in Reno, Nevada that can save his family farm, but Ishmael is conflicted (the deepest emotion of the film) because he has strayed from the Amish country. Ishmael's brother is the requisite family member sent to bring the stray relative back home, and Vanessa Angel is extra-hot as the love interest for almost every guy in the film.If you think this is a parody of bowling, the joke may be on you. Hang around enough lanes, in certain places, and you just might see these guys or something very close to them. Just be careful if they look drunk and want to play for money.

Suffice to say, although I liked it, I didn't quite understand it the way that I do now as an adult.....and I imagine I'll understand it even more in another decade and so on and so on...Bette Davis is MAGNIFICENT in this film. Though I am a Bette Davis fan, I am also a very tough critic, as I am a writer of screenplays and novels. I cannot say that I agree with all of Bette's Oscar nominations, in that a good few of them were given based on the popularity of the film and, well, because she was Bette Davis. I can't say enough about her performance in this film though...I think that the character of Margo worked so well for her because it hit so close to home. She was 42 and Margo was 40, She was a talented aging actress and so was Margo, etc. etc.... I love that the film is equally dramatic as it is comedic and Bette captured it so well. I don't want to spoil the film by any means, but look for the equally heart-breaking and hilarious scene titled Coming Unglued on the DVD. This is still during the time in the film where Margo is the only one that is on to Eve's plan. Just look for Bette, standing on the stage and swinging her purse back & fourth, screaming at the play-write, You may change this star any time you want, for a new, and fresh, and exciting one, fully equipped with fire and music.

Anne Baxter as Eve is amazing as well and I just live for the moment in the film where she stupidly laughs in Addison's (George Sanders) face and he slaps her back into reality...LOVE IT!

The atmosphere, the interesting camera angles and use of motion with the wind and the grasses. I found that to be very nicely done.The killings of the original are set up just as unrealistically though, what with Kirk walking into the house, tripping right into Leatherface.We could say as a young punk he is the sort that likes to be sneaky, heck i was sneaky growing up too, so it's not completely unrealistic him going into the stranger's house uninvited.Then the girl follows him in, now that IS realistic. It makes sense why she would go in, because now she is wondering where he went.The way he hangs her on the hook, so matteroffact, that was really eloquently done, mainly because it was not overdone, and unassuming, and yet so many movies have been inspired by this movie it's hard not to give this movie credit for how it so unabashedly pushed the envelope for it's day.The movie was definitely not scary though. Leatherface makes such quick work of his victims, so the movie is not gory, or frightening, or tense, just kinda weird.I can imagine seeing this in the theaters back in 74 must've been pretty scary though, these days we have a few thousand more horror movies under our belts that we are more desensitized by horror, since horror has pushed the envelope so far since TCM first came out.In all fairness that is.The scene at the dining table was a bit overdone, the closeup camera angles on the eyes and screams and such kinda went on and on and on and felt a little contrived.Having the dead grandpa hitting her with the hammer was pretty cool.Oh and if Marilyn Burns reads this review you were a cutie in this movie.

Most people see it as a lazy re-hash of the first instalment and most people hate the way that it dispensed with the other surviving characters of Aliens. Well, I can kind of see their point. Alien 3, like the first, does opt for the dark, claustrophobic atmosphere of the first and it does have the same stalk and slash mentality &#150; there are no big guns here. And, yes, it does rather ruthlessly kill off the characters of Aliens. But I can't really see it being any other way. The Alien series isn't about Hicks or Newt. It's about Ripley, and it's always been her alone against the alien. To have Hicks and Newt tagging along would feel like Aliens Revisited. It would just be, for the second time, Ripley fighting the alien to protect her surrogate daughter. At least here she gets to do something different. It isn't a fight for survival, or a fight to protect Newt. It's a fight to keep the alien away from The Company.One of the many things that annoyed and enraged me about Alien Resurrection (now there's an Alien film truly worthy of revulsion) was the way that they dispensed with the main villain of the piece, the mysterious, all-seeing company. That was one of the fun things in the series. You felt like there was something bigger and more important going on. And the filmmakers developed it superbly. In the first film it was only on the periphery. But in the second film, with Burke, it was brought to the front. So I like the way that Alien 3 develops it even further. The Company has an almost Orwellian presence. It seems to see everything. And so Ripley's fight to kill the alien before The Company can get it's hand on it seems entirely convincing. Indeed, there's a great scene &#150; one of those rabble-rousing moments you only see in films &#150; where she explains The Company's motivation to the prisoners. It's an excellent nod to the fans and one that gets you even more fully behind her cause. Don't trust those greedy capitalists, man.Of course, the company man in the film (Aaron) is a stupid sheep, but rather than ape what Cameron did with Burke &#150; and make him totally untrustworthy &#150; he's just a man trying to do his job and earn a living. And at the end, after lots of abuse from the prisoners, he actually grows a set and takes a swipe at one of the company men. Too bad, then, that this action gets him killed. I mean, during the final sequence, when all the prisoners are being chased by the alien in the maze, he finds a quiet room and sits it out. I thought, then, that this might show a new dawning of intelligence. But instead, after looking like he's been saved, he does something brave, but stupid, and gets himself killed. You've got to know when to pick your fights, Aaron.Another complaint that people seem to toss in the direction of Alien 3 is that the characters all look the same. Well, personally, I think the characters stand out pretty damn well. Sure they may all have shaved craniums, but I think that the writing and the acting are pretty damn strong. They all have distinct personalities &#150; which is a pretty good feat when you're dealing with rapists, murders and pederasts &#150; and it's only the ones that get killed in seconds that feel generic. Dillon stands out the most. He's the kind of hardnut that can kick your head in and say something poetic at the same time. Plus, he takes the alien on in hand-to-hand combat and insults the alien's fighting skills as he's being killed. How can you not dig a man like that? In fact, he's one of the best anti-heroes in a long time. Charles S. Dutton is excellent. I also think that Charles Dance is great. He gets killed off rather early, but he makes his scenes count. And he even gets to sleep with Ripley. Sure, in film tradition, this means that he has to die, but, hey, at least he went there. And Brian Glover, Ralph Brown, Pete Postlethwaite and Paul McGann are superb. Plus I like the way that one of the more peripheral characters survives.And the film is also quite poetic. The cremation scene in particular stands out. It has some great dialogue, a fantastic score and the alien birth is beautiful in a perverse way. And the final moments, too, are great.But what of the alien in this film? Well, aside from the occasional dodgy bit of effects work in the maze sequence &#150; it sometimes moves like its got piles &#150; it's pretty damn good. It's certainly better than the gloop covered monsters of Resurrection. And it gets some pretty good moments. The killing where the blood sprays over Paul McGann's face is nice, as is the amusing killing of Brain Glover. And I also like the bit where it meets Ripley face to face. Somehow, in the Jeunet film, the aliens were no longer threatening, but in Alien 3 it still has the right stuff. Perhaps the one miscue is giving the alien a POV shot &#150; I didn't think the alien had eyes &#150; but, hey, the shots work visually, so who cares? And I think the film would have been a fitting end to the series. Ripley finally meets The Company and she sacrifices herself to deny them and to save mankind. That's pretty good going in my book. And I wouldn't have thought the character would have anywhere to go if they somehow would have managed to bring her back to life. Well, when I first saw it, I had hopes for Resurrection, but unfortunately, I was proved right. The series should have ended here.

Indeed, there's a great scene &#150; one of those rabble-rousing moments you only see in films &#150; where she explains The Company's motivation to the prisoners. It's an excellent nod to the fans and one that gets you even more fully behind her cause. Don't trust those greedy capitalists, man.Of course, the company man in the film (Aaron) is a stupid sheep, but rather than ape what Cameron did with Burke &#150; and make him totally untrustworthy &#150; he's just a man trying to do his job and earn a living. And at the end, after lots of abuse from the prisoners, he actually grows a set and takes a swipe at one of the company men. Too bad, then, that this action gets him killed. I mean, during the final sequence, when all the prisoners are being chased by the alien in the maze, he finds a quiet room and sits it out. I thought, then, that this might show a new dawning of intelligence. But instead, after looking like he's been saved, he does something brave, but stupid, and gets himself killed. You've got to know when to pick your fights, Aaron.Another complaint that people seem to toss in the direction of Alien 3 is that the characters all look the same. Well, personally, I think the characters stand out pretty damn well. Sure they may all have shaved craniums, but I think that the writing and the acting are pretty damn strong. They all have distinct personalities &#150; which is a pretty good feat when you're dealing with rapists, murders and pederasts &#150; and it's only the ones that get killed in seconds that feel generic. Dillon stands out the most. He's the kind of hardnut that can kick your head in and say something poetic at the same time. Plus, he takes the alien on in hand-to-hand combat and insults the alien's fighting skills as he's being killed. How can you not dig a man like that? In fact, he's one of the best anti-heroes in a long time. Charles S. Dutton is excellent. I also think that Charles Dance is great. He gets killed off rather early, but he makes his scenes count. And he even gets to sleep with Ripley. Sure, in film tradition, this means that he has to die, but, hey, at least he went there. And Brian Glover, Ralph Brown, Pete Postlethwaite and Paul McGann are superb. Plus I like the way that one of the more peripheral characters survives.And the film is also quite poetic. The cremation scene in particular stands out. It has some great dialogue, a fantastic score and the alien birth is beautiful in a perverse way. And the final moments, too, are great.But what of the alien in this film? Well, aside from the occasional dodgy bit of effects work in the maze sequence &#150; it sometimes moves like its got piles &#150; it's pretty damn good. It's certainly better than the gloop covered monsters of Resurrection. And it gets some pretty good moments. The killing where the blood sprays over Paul McGann's face is nice, as is the amusing killing of Brain Glover. And I also like the bit where it meets Ripley face to face. Somehow, in the Jeunet film, the aliens were no longer threatening, but in Alien 3 it still has the right stuff. Perhaps the one miscue is giving the alien a POV shot &#150; I didn't think the alien had eyes &#150; but, hey, the shots work visually, so who cares? And I think the film would have been a fitting end to the series. Ripley finally meets The Company and she sacrifices herself to deny them and to save mankind. That's pretty good going in my book. And I wouldn't have thought the character would have anywhere to go if they somehow would have managed to bring her back to life. Well, when I first saw it, I had hopes for Resurrection, but unfortunately, I was proved right. The series should have ended here.

Most people see it as a lazy re-hash of the first instalment and most people hate the way that it dispensed with the other surviving characters of Aliens. Well, I can kind of see their point. Alien 3, like the first, does opt for the dark, claustrophobic atmosphere of the first and it does have the same stalk and slash mentality &#150; there are no big guns here. And, yes, it does rather ruthlessly kill off the characters of Aliens. But I can't really see it being any other way. The Alien series isn't about Hicks or Newt. It's about Ripley, and it's always been her alone against the alien. To have Hicks and Newt tagging along would feel like Aliens Revisited. It would just be, for the second time, Ripley fighting the alien to protect her surrogate daughter. At least here she gets to do something different. It isn't a fight for survival, or a fight to protect Newt. It's a fight to keep the alien away from The Company.One of the many things that annoyed and enraged me about Alien Resurrection (now there's an Alien film truly worthy of revulsion) was the way that they dispensed with the main villain of the piece, the mysterious, all-seeing company. That was one of the fun things in the series. You felt like there was something bigger and more important going on. And the filmmakers developed it superbly. In the first film it was only on the periphery. But in the second film, with Burke, it was brought to the front. So I like the way that Alien 3 develops it even further.

Good thing that this film isn't well known because if it was the suicide rate on earth would rise by 30%. I wish that I had never bought it, they wouldn't give me my money back so I ran it over with my car multiple times. The only thing that kept my through it was penelope cruz (and she isn't even that good looking). I am glad that tom cruise' face gets mangled because he deserves it for making such a bad film. At one point I considered throwing it away but I think that my bin is too good for that. I also considered giving it away but I didn't want other people too feel the pain I suffer every single day after watching It. So my only choice was to destroy it so that no one could pick it up by accident again. I think that on the ring they shouldn't have used that freaky film, they should have used this one.

It is an obtuse story, yet haunting in detail, mesmerizing in its depth. Minghella brings it to the screen perfectly capturing its entire emotional content. I recall gripping the armrest of my seat almost from that drifting opening image of a biplane flying over the sensuous ripples of desert sand interspersed with shots of a hand painstakingly drawing primitive human figures with a calligraphist's brush. I was hooked and knew in those moments that this was going to be a special treat.The movie's story is not convoluted. Nevertheless, it appears veiled. The many layers of narrative are initially hidden and are then gently and beautifully revealed. This narrational unfolding could be the re-assembling of the tortured memory of its central protagonist, Count Almasy (possibly Ralph Fiennes finest portrayal), a badly burnt, dying young man who is being cared for by a French-Canadian Allied nurse, Hana (wonderfully nuanced performance by that elegant French actress, Juliette Binoche). He lies in a large bed that seems to accentuate his frail and damaged body. This is a makeshift nursing station in an abandoned Italian monastery put together by Hana. She has volunteered to separate from her medical unit because her charge is too ill to travel further. Who is her patient? Is he English? We don't initially know. Between the Count's morphine induced ramblings and some clarity afforded by the mysterious Carvaggio (very effective turn by Willem Dafoe) who descends on this desolate pair, we begin to learn Almasy's identity and the pieces begin to fall into place. An epic tale unfolds, some from the patient's faltering memory and others from the accusative probings of Carvaggio. It is an epic tale of an obsessive forbidden romance between Almasy and Katherine Clifton, the unfulfilled wife of his Royal Geographic Expedition colleague. We are never sure of where all this takes place. It must be the Middle Eastern desert. But exactly where? Even though we are geographically lost, we know the approximate temporal position of the story. World War II is waging. Somewhere in the expanse of a great desert, perhaps in North Africa, archaeologists (Almasy being one of them) hunt for something. That something is never central to the narrative. How Almasy meets Katherine and is engulfed and convulsed by his intense attraction to her, is. They meet, they love and just as they happen to touch the highest bliss of consummation, a torrent of events deeply incises their union.It is compelling to think that this movie is a metaphor for something. It is full of so many exquisite images and so many literary underpinnings. I believe that it is like a Greek tragedy, crushing in it's impact, embodying a deep sense of where it unfolds.

The irony that he is cared for a young woman growing to love his pain, his command of facts, his quotations from Herodutus, his notes scribbled on wrinkled inserts in books that allude to his affair that is so intense that she is envious of it. In some ways, the movie is about two romances. The first is the intense physical one that resides in the English Patients memory.
