You have to see this film.  I have seen it four times so far and I still haven't made up my mind as to what exactly happened in the film.  That is all I am going to say because if you have not seen this film, then stop reading right now.If you are still reading then I am going to pose some questions to you and maybe if anyone has any answers you can email me and let me know what you think.I remember my Grade 11 English teacher quite well.  His name was Mr. Krisak.  To me, he was wise beyond his years and he always had this circuitous way of teaching you things that perhaps you weren't all too keen on.  If we didn't like Shakespeare, then he turned the story into a modern day romance with modern day language so we could understand it.  Our class room was never a room, it was a cottage and we were on the lake reading a book at our own leisure time.  This was his own indelible way of branding something into our sponge-like minds.  I begin this review of Vanilla Sky with a description of this brilliant man because he once gave us an assignment that has been firmly etched in my mind, like the phone number of a long lost best friend, and it finally made some sense to me after watching The Matrix.  Now if I didn't know better, I would have thought that the Wachowski brothers were really just an alias for my teacher Mr. Krisak.  But giving them the benefit of the doubt, we'll assume it wasn't him.  But that was the first time this assignment was anything more than impalpable. He had asked us to prove to him and to ourselves that were real.  Show me how you can tell that you are real.  This got the class spouting off all of the usual ideas that I'm sure you can imagine.  Everything from pain, to sense of touch to sense of loss to sense of hunger were spouted off to our teacher to prove to him that we were real.  After every scenario that we gave him, he would come back with the one answer that would leave us speechless.What if you are nothing but someone else's dream?What if you were someone else's dream?  What a messed up question that is.  This was a question\/scenario posed to us about 15 years ago, before the astronomical use of the Internet and rapid advancement of computers.  How possible could it seem back then?  But if you look at today's technology, now ask yourself, what it you were a part of someone else's dream.Another brilliant but surreal film this year, David Lynch's Mulholland Drive explored similar areas.  But Vanilla Sky goes deeper than any other film could hope to.  In short this is one film that will literally (if you let it) blow your mind from all of the possibilities that surround you.Open your Eyes.Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a young, hot shot, righteous, full of himself publisher and owner of several magazines.  He inherited this from his father and although he has talent and business savvy, his board of governers, the Seven Dwarfs, think he is a rich dink born with a silver spoon in his mouth.  They feel he has done nothing to deserve the pinnacle of success that each and every one of them believes should go to them.  Early in the film we meet one of David's gorgeous toys named Julie Gianni, played with pernicious but bombastic perfection by Cameron Diaz.  David and Julie play a good game, both claiming they are just there to use each other and are not the slightest bit interested in a monogamous, committed relationship.  This is the type of relationship commensurate with David's other flings he's had in the sexual prime of his life.  And although both talk a good game, we can tell that only one is really telling the truth. Next we meet Brian Shelby, played with a stroke of genius by Kevin Smith's good buddy Jason Lee.  Brian is writing a book that David is going to publish but they are also very good friends.  This is something that David has very little of in his life and you can sense a real caring for one another early on in the film.  Brian has one famous line that he keeps telling David over and over again.  And that is  the sweet ain't so sweet without the bitter.  He goes on to tell him that one day he will find true love and not just this part time lover status that he seems to perpetrate with all of the floozies who inhabit his bed for a night or two.At David's huge birthday bash, (so huge that the likes of Steven Spielberg wish him a happy birthday) Brian enters with his date, Sofia Sorrano, played of course by Penelope Cruz with what has to be the best performance of this year by an actress.  This is a bash by invite only and at first David and Sofia seem intrigued with one another.  And in typical David fashion, despite his best friend being there, he begins to flirt with Sofia.  To complicate things, Julie shows up uninvited and begins spying on David.  David then spends the night with Sofia, but they only talk and draw caricatures of one another.  There is no hanky panky.  The next day, as David is leaving Sofia's apartment, he is greeted by Julie, who offers him a ride and from there.......well, I think we have all seen the commercials.That is all I will really say about the plot, because from here the film teases us with what is reality and what is blurred perception.  We are introduced to a character played by Kurt Russel and a few other shady characters that all play a part in this labyrinth like haze.  There is a subtext of death and possible panacea-like cure-alls that may or not be able to create the possibility of eternal life.  This is just one of the intriguing possibilities the movie offers us, but it doesn't end there.Like many movies seem to thrive on today, this film has a secret.  Sixth Sense may have began this craze, but look even further back and you can maybe thank Angel Heart for starting the craze.  Regardless of how it originated, Vanilla Sky has one of it's own surreptitious gut busters.  And what makes this one so much fun is that the film gives you many obvious clues along the way but not enough to give you an apodictic solution to the gauntlet of truth and lies you have just put yourself through.  I have seen this film four times and every time it has been because I want to see if there is something more I can pick up, something more I can understand.  To be able to work your mind in the theater, to enable it to open up to new possibilities is something rare in a film.  All of the ersatz so called Best Pictures of the year have been good but nothing spectacular.  They lack substance.  A Beautiful Mind was intriguing but flat, The Royal Tenenbaums was interesting but uneven.  Vanilla Sky is a rarity because it is a film that leaves you yearning for more yet guarantees your satisfaction because the film and those that made it care about it.  I know this film has received mixed reviews but I just think that those who don't like it don't quite understand it.  This is what film making is supposed to be like.  This is what a film is supposed to do to you.  It is supposed to make you feel something.  Most of the other films this year have been just empty spaces.  This one isn't.10 out of 10  The best film of the year.  I would love to see this get nominated for best picture and I would love to see Cruz up for best Actress, Diaz for best supporting, Cruise for best actor and Jason Mewes should be a shoe in for best supporting actor.  Cameron Crowe should there as well.  None of this may come to pass, and that is a shame.  This is one film that should not be missed.  And on a final note, I am quite sure Mr. Krisak would like this film and maybe this is the one film that may answer his question.  Can you prove you are real?  Or are we just a figment of someone's imagination? Are we artificially transplanted for someone else's bemusement?  This is a film that spawns more questions than it does answers.

Legend is so-so (but I want to see the director's cut with Jerry Goldsmith's music on DVD, what the hell is going on with this release ???), Someone To Watch Over Me has great acting, Black Rain is beautiffly stylised (but what a bad and cliche scenario), 1492 A Conquest of Paradise has great music and images (but how can the story of Christophe Colomb be boring like that ??? And sorry Ridley, your only miscast of all your directing career  Gerard Depardieu, you could have choose worst, but surely better). Whitesqual is too long and G.I. Jane is just too confusing. Hannibal represend well the book (but the book is not very good... so the film too, but at least I like it !). Gladiator was good, but could have been better.Now Black Hawk Down. I wasn't expected mush when I heard that the producer was Jerry Bruckeimer who is the king at producing brainless action movie featuring bad actors (or at least baddly directed actors)! In fact I am please with the result. It is possibly the best movie produced by Bruckeimer of all his career, but that does not mean that BHD is a great movie ! It is a very well crafted action movie with little deep (very very little).I find it a bit pretentious. It wants to be The Thin Red Line but it is far from it, exepted maybe for the cinematography, they are tie.Technically the movie is good. The editing well done (Pietro Scallia does his best job in a Ridley Scott movie here). And the team Scott\/Zimmer works marvellously again. Scott and Zimmer never use big loud music to underscore the visuals (like so much movies produced by Bruckeimer). It really a thing to avoid in a war movie (at least in modern war film).The weak thing of the movie is that it miss the moral found in such films like Appocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket, Bridge on the River Kwai, etc... A bit too much patriotic, but the worst thing is that the Somalians are represented as the bad guy and nothing more ( but hey ! it is a Bruckeimer movie).It is sad for Scott because he deserves recognition for his work behind the camera, but the problem is that a great director must also add dept in a film. Give a very good script to Scott and you have 95% of chance that you have a pretty good movie (Thelma and Louise) !

Grant and Mason are wonderful, and who could resist hearing their famous voices together in the same film. I love the way James Mason says, Rapid City, South Da-ko-ta. The dialogue is quite funny. Hitchcock creates several great scenes besides the Mount Rushmore and the famous cropdusting scenes. For instance, the scene in which Roger Thornhill and his mother are on the elevator with Van Damme's henchmen, who are out to kill him. Only Hitchcock could make this so superbly. As the elevator descends, the music grows more intense and suspenseful, until the breaking point, at which Roger's mother says You gentlemen aren't really trying to kill my son, are you? To which the henchmen respond with side-splitting laughter, and are echoed by all the people on the elevator, including Roger's mother (played splendidly by Jessye Royce Landis), who laughs loudest of all.The house which Van Damme resides in at the end is quite architecturally unique, as much as the house in Glen Cove is elegant and done quite well. There are some character actors in this film who will remind you of other roles they had, like the guy who played Chief in the hit series, Get Smart, or the guy who plays one of the henchmen, who was the psychiatrist in a movie about a character played by Anthony Perkins who had a mental breakdown.I admire Martin Landau's work in this film, and think he is severely underrated. Thank goodness he got some recognition for Ed Wood. The trick of rubbing a pad and paper to find out an address as employed by Thornhill in the hotel room amazed me as a kid. Notice Thornhill (Grant) whistles Singin' in the Rain when he pretends to shower. Also, notice Hitchcock's cameo at the beginning when the titles are being displayed, he walks up to a bus door right as it is being closed, and as he walks forward, his title, Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, disappears horizontally, left-to-right.This movie is best watched from the very beginning before Leo the Lion's roar, while eating coconut cake (with 3 layers and real coconut, not angel flake). I really have tried it that way, several times.The panic scene that ensues after the real Mr. Townsend is knifed by one of Van Damme's henchmen in the United Nations Building is great cinematography. The ladies standing up, in shock, the photographer, the person saying, He's got a knife, and Thornhill's protestations of innocence go together to make a great scene.

All the dialogue in the love scenes is great, and of course, Hermann's musical number, Conversation Piece, is quite good.

Twohy, involves a commercial space flight carrying forty passengers that crash lands on an unknown desert planet.  With three suns above them, there is plenty of daylight in which the survivors can negotiate their quest for survival, and finding water is their main concern.  As they begin to explore the wastelands for sustenance, they find evidence that others have been there, apparently some years before them  A small ship and a couple of buildings; all of which appears to have been abruptly left behind.  Lead by pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell), the small band of survivors have a couple of additional obstacles in their way, as well.  One is Riddick (Vin Diesel), a murderer who was being transported to a penal colony.  But he may not be their greatest danger; because there is someone-- or something-- else close by.  Very close.  An entity that in all probability is responsible for the disappearance of those who came before.  And, if that isn't enough, Fry ascertains that the three suns above them will be setting soon; their world is about to be plunged into absolute darkness.

The other actors are all great, especially John-Rhyes Davis (Gah .. I can't spell his name) as Gimli was excellent. He had the dwarven voice down great.

It is an attempt to portray a grand love story in the context of serious political questions, but ultimately it ends up as just another soppy romance, pleasurable to watch, but with no real substance or depth. The character of Katie isn't coherent enough at times to make the film work, despite the fact that Striesand is perfectly cast in this role . At college she's cold and abrasive when Hubble makes overtures towards her, but when they meet again years later she acts like a giddy school girl with a crush. There are powerful moments when they argue over principles and the future of their relationship, but the problems that drive them apart aren't explored deeply enough to make it work. It's hard to believe that they could be so deliriously happy when Katie announces she's pregnant, only to have everthing fall to pieces before the baby is even born. Given the supposed depth of their love for each other, Hubble's affair is completely unconvincing, even making allowances for the volatile political situation they find themselves in.The film had great potential to explore the pressures that outside forces can have on two people with very different views who love each other against all the odds, and how these pressures will ultimately take their toll, but it lacks the insight that could have made it a really great film. Instead it opts for the sugar-coated version that's bound to be a crowd pleaser, but leaves the more discerning viewer feeling slightly disappointed and empty.That said, I did like the ending a lot, and believe that Robert Redford is a fine actor. The brief look of intense pain & regret in Hubble's eyes when he is confronted with everything he has lost, and everything that could have been when he meets Katie on the street in New York almost makes up for the rest of the films flaws. He took the easy way out, and is forced to admit this to himself, if only for a moment before he is swept back into his glamourous lifestyle as a screen writer. Katie, on the other hand has stayed true to her beliefs, and she summs it up the fims theme perfectly when she tells Hubble that she likes his girl. It is a girl he has chosen over a woman that could have brought out the very best in him, and helped him to be the kind of man he yearned to be, but didn't have the determination or courage for, and this is where the great tragedy of the film lies. Definitely worth seeing.

The brief look of intense pain & regret in Hubble's eyes when he is confronted with everything he has lost, and everything that could have been when he meets Katie on the street in New York almost makes up for the rest of the films flaws. He took the easy way out, and is forced to admit this to himself, if only for a moment before he is swept back into his glamourous lifestyle as a screen writer. Katie, on the other hand has stayed true to her beliefs, and she summs it up the fims theme perfectly when she tells Hubble that she likes his girl. It is a girl he has chosen over a woman that could have brought out the very best in him, and helped him to be the kind of man he yearned to be, but didn't have the determination or courage for, and this is where the great tragedy of the film lies. Definitely worth seeing.  ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"23 January 2002","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  A wonderful adaptation of a wonderful book.

I have seen 'Strictly Ballroom' quite a few times and 'Moulin Rouge' more than any other film ever, most likely.And so, why not see Romeo + Juliet, the one film in which the two combine? Well, maybe because there has never been a good adaptation of the play to film- never.The 1936 one, a bore, the 1968 one, terrible, the others, well, the others most of the people I know of agree- sucks.Except for 'Westside Story', which is, after all, not the play, just the story, and even then, one of the lesser musicals.William Shakespeare is NOT the spectacle Hollywood would want you to believe, in fact, it isn't even the spectacle this film would leave you to believe, but nonetheless it's my honest opinion that this film IS one William Shakespeare- not in the historical context but in the context of the spirit. As Baz continually said during the commentary, track to 'Moulin Rouge', he wasn't interested in creating the real-world Moulin Rouge of 1900, or in this case the real play, on it's opening night, but rather the feel of it, for today's, modern, audience, particularly the young, hip, teens and 20-somethings, who need such aid better than anyone else.And lets picture what that opening night would've been like. Entering `The Globe Theatre', us- the slimy peasants, with natty hair, dirty skin, smelly armpits, and hair- everywhere, even the ladies. Paying cheap prices for the cheap seats, right down in front. Not only right down in front, but on the dirt, with rats, worms, and other such creatures of the night. Ready to watch a play by one Shakespeare, we'd seen plays of his before, and enjoyed them, and excitement is building. The curtain comes up- the play begins, little scenery, costumes and props, just the words, and the actors to say them. We, such unintelligent low-life's, listen to them closely, understanding every word of poetry, hanging on to every syllable, the words filling our souls, the excitements building, and we're whisked away on and unending dream of hope, love, violence, and hate, as we have never done before, or ever will. The doomed were not kings, not emperors, not generals, or pharos, not even truly aristocrats yet, just young lovers, hopeless dreamers, slight eccentrics, as we all once were, and hoped to be again. And for the hour or two of the play's duration we were, and when they died, when it ended we wept not just for them, but also for ourselves.This is what a truly good movie does to us, happy or sad, this is what there meant to do. Like 'Citizen Cane',  'Intolerance', 'Greed', or for a lighter fix, 'Singing in the Rain', 'A Hard Days Night', 'Moulin Rouge', and most certainly 'Romeo + Juliet'.We go in, our jobs bugging us, the stress killing us, fear overriding us, to find sticky floors, chewing gum, and crusty popcorn. The lights gently come down, the sound, abruptly comes up, in one of those annoying THX sound blast things, and suddenly, the world changes, specks of light, sound, blacks and whites, all the colors of the rainbow, flash onto the screen in an unendingly magical mesh of sights, sounds, emotions. The story doesn't matter- if it did then this film wouldn't be here, the play would've been forgotten long from now- it's pulp drivel, violence and contrived love for the entertainment of peasants, back long before you were born. But the sights overwhelm you; the sounds fill your ear, the listen to every note, grasp every frame, and are whisked up on a journey of hope, love, violence, and hate. Thanks to the film and to the words, you become a teen-ager once again feeling love for the first time, and when they die, you weep, not just for them, but also for yourself.Baz Luhrman is the only man, woman even, in Hollywood, or the world over, who truly understands William Shakespeare and his work, or at least attempted to bring it to the screen with such a true understanding, with the possible and quite notable exceptions of the cast and crew involved in the making, producing, and writing of this film, (a statement which has a two exceptions of it's own, dear Claire and Leo, who play the leads.)They created a film, which brings to us, today, what the play was to them, yesterday, and those before them, and those before them, all the way to that very first performance.The cinematography, lighting, editing, sets, and what not are some of the best if not the best I have ever seen.The music is absolutely brilliant, even including a few minor musical numbers using modern pop songs, as Baz and his team did later in Moulin Rouge.And then I guess we're forced to move onto the acting which is quite good, but quite a few of the lines are muddled, yelled, are meshed all together- but that is of no importance, for what word was to the peasants, the visuals, score, and sound effects are to us thus placing the word- useless.Now of course that view might place some out of favor of this review but trust me, the film would be equally poetic with or without the work of the great Shakespeare. But the attitude would not.This film is brilliant in all manners and if you dislike it your probably one of those `Shakespeare Purists' who think that Romeo & Juliet should be paraded in the fashion it was meant for with sets, costumes and stars the Globe would have never afforded, and using true Italian actors, on an English play, but quite frankly, not to be rude, you are quite wrong in your theory, how should Shakespeare play, like any great thing, however it's interpreters wish, but for my money, the only one worth viewing, is this, or maybe Julie Taymor's Titus- especially if you liked this, and even more so if you didn't.A film of wonder, majesty, grace, beauty, elegance, excitement, romance, love, comedy and violence, Romeo + Juliet is truly perfect, in an (admittedly) flawed way, but aren't all greats?AND ALSO OF NOTE- SOMEWHAT OF A ***SPOILER***  Many people have stated this films gang-war aspects were stolen from 'West-Side Story', but, if you really pay attention, the two houses in Romeo + Juliet are business rivals, their children, and friends of them, merely juvenile delinquents with some need to hate somebody and so the choose each other, due solely, to there families hate, just as in the original, relatively.
