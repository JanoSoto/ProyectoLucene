It follows our surviving characters as they continue on through October 31, 1978, which has got to be the longest night in the recorded history of mankind. How many hours were in that day, anyway? Laurie is whisked away to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital in an ambulance, and it never occurs to anybody that Michael might want to finish the job he started on her, or that wherever she is, they'll find him. There's also a very silly 'plot twist' about Laurie's connection to Michael. The new characters are a bunch of hospital employees who are mostly uninteresting and are clearly only in the picture to be murdered.So why do I keep coming back to this sequel more often than the original?It's illogical, but this movie has a lot of the same appeal of Halloween. I love the fact that they just went for it and started the thing exactly where the previous film ended. Once you accept that this is not the original, there is more to love. What Halloween II has going for it is a very European sense of style that mimics Argento's best moments. Visually, the movie looks great. We've yet to see a truly great DVD transfer for Halloween II, and I hope one day we get it. There are a lot of subtle, eerie touches, some recreated from the original and a few new ideas. Characters drive around nighttime streets with their faces illuminated by green lights in the dark vehicle interiors. Laurie's hospital room is dim and intimidating, large shadows moving over her bed. It's never explained in the theatrical cut, but the hospital turns dark and spooky by the end of the movie, and there's something very unsettling about seeing a hospital so dim.The Carpenter game plan of having The Shape lurking in the background works well and often here, particularly an opening sequence where it is glimpsed behind a woman in her kitchen. In another, it is glimpsed as a shadow, and in one of the best shots, the ghostly white face looms behind several panes of glass through a darkened room. Dean Cundey revisits several shots from the original, like the mask slowly materializing out of the darkness behind an unsuspecting character. There are also a number of point-of-view tracking shots in this one; Carpenter did it first in the original, but this is also another favorite Argento trick, usually used to disguise the identity of the killer. The only difference is that here, we already know who's doing it.Another brazenly Argento touch is the music. The brilliant original score has been pumped up here, it's almost like a score by Argento's own favorites, Goblin. One or two of the scenes pay homage to Dario with no misrepresentation, including a murder where a woman is drowned in a tub full of scalding water (from Deep Red). Also, note the segment where Laurie escapes The Shape by shimmying through a small window near the ceiling, only to find that it leads not to safety, but to yet another room on the other side. Lucky for her, it wasn't a room full of razor wire.It's sad that the script didn't give Jamie Lee Curtis more to do. As if they only had her on-set for a day or two, she spends most of the film in a catatonic state, revitalizing only at the climax where she must flee from The Shape once again. Her actual dialogue in the film is very limited, and even worse, they made her wear an awfully cheap-looking wig. Donald Pleasance, on the other hand, carries a lot of the film, and is even more over the top, practically frothing at the mouth. While the film has its Argento cues down pat, it does lack his manic energy. Dario's best movies seem to lunge at the viewer, while Halloween II is more like a trash compactor, moving slowly and inexorably toward a bloody conclusion. The biggest disappointment here is the attempt that's been made to 'explain' things by giving Myers a motivation for his attack on Laurie. Even worse, Carpenter's script ignores something that made the original so nerve-wracking the murders were perpetrated by a homicidal maniac who also had a childlike sense of humor, as in donning a ghost-sheet to toy with one victim before strangling her. In this film he's more like an efficient windup toy. The gruesome murders are mostly implausible, but otherwise quite memorable in their outrageousness, and something must be said for the way that this film taps into the inherent revulsion of common hospital equipment designed to cut, poke, and prod into our bodies in the name of medicine. The most unsettling moments involve needles being inserted into parts of the body where they can do no good.Unlike the original, Halloween II was written off by most critics upon its release, and perhaps rightfully so. A movie called Halloween II could only be more of the same, especially since by 1981, the slasher genre was in full swing (ironically sparked by the success of the original Halloween). But what this sequel has to offer is nostalgia for fans of horror films in general; for about 90 minutes, you get to imagine that the original film never ended. As if that wasn't enough, there are a number of affectionate homages to the films of Argento, and they work almost as well here as they did in his own movies. Like the best gialli, Halloween II gleefully overlooks its own silliness and becomes a stylish nightmare. I find that, even though it's technically not as good as the original, it is also a noteworthy film in its own right, and equally memorable.

","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"30 October 2000","score":"16 out of 25 people found the following review useful","review":" Halloween II is clearly a rote cash-in sequel that, by all rights, should have been dismal. It follows our surviving characters as they continue on through October 31, 1978, which has got to be the longest night in the recorded history of mankind. How many hours were in that day, anyway? Laurie is whisked away to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital in an ambulance, and it never occurs to anybody that Michael might want to finish the job he started on her, or that wherever she is, they'll find him. There's also a very silly 'plot twist' about Laurie's connection to Michael. The new characters are a bunch of hospital employees who are mostly uninteresting and are clearly only in the picture to be murdered.So why do I keep coming back to this sequel more often than the original?It's illogical, but this movie has a lot of the same appeal of Halloween. I love the fact that they just went for it and started the thing exactly where the previous film ended. Once you accept that this is not the original, there is more to love. What Halloween II has going for it is a very European sense of style that mimics Argento's best moments. Visually, the movie looks great. We've yet to see a truly great DVD transfer for Halloween II, and I hope one day we get it. There are a lot of subtle, eerie touches, some recreated from the original and a few new ideas. Characters drive around nighttime streets with their faces illuminated by green lights in the dark vehicle interiors. Laurie's hospital room is dim and intimidating, large shadows moving over her bed. It's never explained in the theatrical cut, but the hospital turns dark and spooky by the end of the movie, and there's something very unsettling about seeing a hospital so dim.The Carpenter game plan of having The Shape lurking in the background works well and often here, particularly an opening sequence where it is glimpsed behind a woman in her kitchen. In another, it is glimpsed as a shadow, and in one of the best shots, the ghostly white face looms behind several panes of glass through a darkened room. Dean Cundey revisits several shots from the original, like the mask slowly materializing out of the darkness behind an unsuspecting character. There are also a number of point-of-view tracking shots in this one; Carpenter did it first in the original, but this is also another favorite Argento trick, usually used to disguise the identity of the killer. The only difference is that here, we already know who's doing it.Another brazenly Argento touch is the music. The brilliant original score has been pumped up here, it's almost like a score by Argento's own favorites, Goblin. One or two of the scenes pay homage to Dario with no misrepresentation, including a murder where a woman is drowned in a tub full of scalding water (from Deep Red). Also, note the segment where Laurie escapes The Shape by shimmying through a small window near the ceiling, only to find that it leads not to safety, but to yet another room on the other side. Lucky for her, it wasn't a room full of razor wire.It's sad that the script didn't give Jamie Lee Curtis more to do. As if they only had her on-set for a day or two, she spends most of the film in a catatonic state, revitalizing only at the climax where she must flee from The Shape once again. Her actual dialogue in the film is very limited, and even worse, they made her wear an awfully cheap-looking wig. Donald Pleasance, on the other hand, carries a lot of the film, and is even more over the top, practically frothing at the mouth. While the film has its Argento cues down pat, it does lack his manic energy. Dario's best movies seem to lunge at the viewer, while Halloween II is more like a trash compactor, moving slowly and inexorably toward a bloody conclusion. The biggest disappointment here is the attempt that's been made to 'explain' things by giving Myers a motivation for his attack on Laurie. Even worse, Carpenter's script ignores something that made the original so nerve-wracking the murders were perpetrated by a homicidal maniac who also had a childlike sense of humor, as in donning a ghost-sheet to toy with one victim before strangling her. In this film he's more like an efficient windup toy.

Blair Witch was such a monumental success and such a unique film that this sequel was destined for doom before it was even conceived.

I can start by saying it would have been too easy to make a similar film in style so credit to the director in that this movie is TOTALLY different from the first film. It is well shot (visually), with some cool effects and a pumping soundtrack. I loved the 1st film but must admit that the phenomena was the most intriguing thing about the film and given that fact the second film does well to pick fun at that and progress a story based on the phenomena. Integrating the 1st film into the second film allows the second one to seem fresh yet at the same time continuing the phenomena.  Regarding the story, on the surface it is thin however I think this one requires some additional thought and possibly some additional viewing. This is not a film about a witch, this is a film about paranoia and the mass hysteria that can be created when people are put into outrageous circumstances, while believing in something that may not actually BE real. I do not want to give away too much of the plot but I felt that it was creative and unique. Is it a masterpiece? No, but it is not the mindless drivel that the film critics are leading us all to believe. I will say that the marketing of the film has been all wrong in that it looks like a Scream type teenie bopper movie and the title, well that just plain sucks.

First of all I have to say I'm a big fan of Chinese culture and civilization which to me comes second best only to the ancient Greek one ( lets be realistic ). Modern-day China continues to amaze me with the likes of Zhang Yimou in film-making or Faye Wong in music. So imagine my anticipation when I was about to watch 'Chouching Dragon, Hidden Tiger', especially after having read some of the reviews on this website. Nevertheless, I have to admit I'm not a great fan of martial arts films though I watch the occassional Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan film on TV. To set the record straight this film is definitely NOT one of the best films ever made, neither in martial arts nor in any other genre- nevertheless, it's a film worth watching.The assumed strong aspects of the film ( plot, actors, direction, cinematography, choreography ) are all open to personal tastes. By that I mean that every person I asked who has seen the film gave me a diferent opinion of it, some liked aspects of it that I consider weak( such as the plot ) and others scorned aspects of the film which I liked ( such as, surprisingly enough,the 'flying'effects! ) All things considered, the strong points of this film in my opinion are definitely the choreography and fighting scenes ( almost like an arcade game ) - I nearly came close to believing the hype, that such people could exist- thus the fantasy aspect of it, in all. The leading actors are top-class too, especially Zhang Zi Yi, and, last but not least, the drama. Now the weak points unfortunately have to do with the story itself ( nice but too superfluous, and it can be summed up to the description 'a sword is stolen, retrieved, stolen and retrieved again' - not much for my liking ) and somehow I felt that the naivity of the whole thing does let down the movie ( it gravitated incessantly between realism and exaggeration, the latter maybe because they tried to mimic the occasional American blockbuster, action adventure- hey! snap out of it, China doesn't need that ) Overall, I grieve at how much better this film could be. If you like drama and romance don't miss out Zhang Yimou's 'The Road Home'. 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is a worth-watching film, nonetheless, and features great performances overall and an exciting new talent in the person of Zhang Zi Yi. No matter if it shows sometimes the icomprehensible tendency of Chinese art to poise between excellency and absurdity.

The third installment at least faired better than the crap Batman & Robin gave us.Val Kilmer played a mediocre Batman\/Bruce Wayne, but no one has really done the characters well enough and Keaton himself did an above average performance. Chris O'Donnell as Robin, well, did an okay job. The villains of the movie were absurd. Joel Schmuck-er tried what Jack Nicholson\/The Joker has set as precedence for villainy and ruined it. Why was the Riddler a maniac? Why did they let Jim Carrey dig into his bag of tricks so much? This isn't the Riddler. I can understand that's Carrey's paycheck right there, his physical antics, but less of it please for crying out loud. I mean how many times can you shape and twist your face into inhuman expressions in a movie? This isn't a blasted comedy. Well holy dogsh**, I guess Joel said it is a comedy. Two-Face is Two-Face because Tommy Lee Jones plays it. WTF? Does that mean good-bye script? I guess the only directing tip to Mr. Lee Jones was, forget the real history of Batman and his foes, here's your chance to be zany!Batman Returns became silly with awkward moments. Batman Forever took it a step further by giving sillier one-liners and transforming Gotham City from the city it was to the Las Vegas it will be. Change is good but not for the worst. This film is an okay to watch for entertainemnt value simply because we're being thrust at with new if not corny ideas from Joel's little mind and thats where it scores decent. Then we watch it again a second time...

","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"30 October 2000","score":"","review":"  Some of the moments in the movie were great, if not a bit freaky, and it all involved the villain in the movie. The orgy scene between him and a mother and daughter and the way he toys with Arnold's character by recreating the murder scene where Arnold's family gets butchered; very graphic, and convincingly evil. Gabriel Byrne plays this villain, a subtle but violent when necessary Satan. Arnold plays a special unit cop with an overused storyline. Without telling to much, he's a widower now living in the dark recesses of his apartment brooding everyday and contemplating suicide. Unfortunately for Arnold, he needs to get his head back together fast enough so he can shoot and blow up whatever supernatural sh** he just got himself into. The problems I had in this film were Robin Tunney's character and Arnold trying a tad to hard to act drama. For Arnold, some moments when he goes into a lapse and flashes back to his family  I had to shake my head and turn away not in tears but in annoyance. I know what he can do. He COULD have done it with less physical emotion. I asked myself that whenever Arnold breaks down. He cranks out some good one-liners, classic, e.g. all to Satan I want you to go to hell. You son-of-a-b****!, but it's just those moments of drama that spoils it. Robin Tunney could have done more for what she was given, and it wasn't much besides playing a complete damsel in complete distress. Some of the lines she spouts were without conviction. I didn't believe her until way later in the end but by that time I couldn't care less for her character.I wouldn't rate this as high as some of Arnold's previous action films, but it's certainly better than Last Action Hero. The story isn't all too intelligent. How else do you fix a problem besides bigger guns?Regardless, I'll see a new Arnold film simply because Arnold is in it. And as long as it doesn't involve him dressing up in a comic book get-up or doing family comedy, he's got my money even if it turns out mediocre like End of Days.
