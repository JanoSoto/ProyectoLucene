The Sixth Sense, one of the best films of the 90's and one of the best plot twists of all time, ultimately sucked all the talent, potential and genius out of Shyamalan and left him as a stupid, egotistic moron who wouldn't know a plot if it was injected directly into his skull. And this is one of his worst films by far.The only reason I have not given this film a 1\/10 is because at least Shyamalan films have half-decent cinematography and he obviously puts a lot of effort into making his films look good. That's where the praise finishes. ALL the actors did a horrible job. Even Gibson's performance is flat and boring. Phoenix does a stereotypical white American jock hero sort of act and fails to give off any emotion. The actors who play the kids are also terrible, they did nothing but irritate me and their acting was bland and talentless. And of course Shyamalan sticks his ugly mug in for several scenes and tries to stammer out fancy sounding lines in an obvious attempt to boost his ego.The worst parts of this train-wreck are the plot holes. Here we have aliens that can build spacecraft and travel billions of miles across the universe... and can't open a pantry door (and what does Mel do upon stumbling across this extra-terrestrial threat? Call the police? No, he goes home and acts like nothing happens, idiot). These aliens, to whom water is like a highly corrosive acid, choose to invade a planet that is mostly water, while naked, running around in air that's full of moisture, sprinting through cornfields that would be covered in water droplets in the morning, not taking into account things like rain, not bringing any tools, medical equipment, weapons or armor, and on top of all that, feeding on humans who are about 80% water. It's so STUPID it hurts. And their top secret communications? You can pick those up on a baby monitor. Please. Also, don't keep your son's life saving medication handy- he'll never need it.That's not the only problem. This film bills itself as a science fiction thriller, but it's a thinly disguised Christian regaining-of-faith flick. Mel looses his faith after his wife is killed by a rouge driver, then he regains it again after he realizes her death rattle was a warning from God to help him defeat the aliens. So what does Mel say? He basically says Thanks God, when he should have been questioning why God made him loose faith and then gave it back to him, only while KILLING his wife in the process! Come on! What a waste of God's time, Mel's time, our time, and some innocent person died for no reason because Mel ended right back at point A! This entire film disgusts me and insults the intelligence of reasonable people everywhere. In the end, I was hoping some of the Hess family would die because they irritated me so much. I almost got my hopes up when that brat started having a respiratory attack but then my hopes were quickly crushed. In the end, the message is God will make you loose your faith, kill your loved ones, and then give your faith back. Good job Shyamalan, your writing and directing talents (but not your acting talents- your cameos suck) never cease to amaze me. This man should be BANNED from making movies.2\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"10 July 2013","score":"6 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" I feel kind of bad for M.

This definitely feels like Kevin Smiths most heartfelt film, it's not to big on the comedy. The best part of this film is that I was thoroughly interested, I only ever checked the runtime because I wanted it to be a little longer. Do not read if sensitive. Let just sum it up. The characters were believable for the most part, Joey Lauren Adams surprisingly didn't annoyed me, that's a first for her. Banky was the only character I actually cared about, even if he was a bit of an as-hole. Holden was just your average every man. And I'll get to Alyssa in a bit. Jay and silent bob only have one scene, I thought there would be more of them since they are on the cover, but oh well. There was a lot of good scenes, my favorites being the hockey rink scene and Silent Bobs story. Those had more weight to the story.Now comes the biggest thing people love to argue over, Alyssa's past. I've looked up and down the forums here, and people love talking about this. Well, it did bring a lot of drama into the story. Don't get sensitive over this, but yes, Alyssa was a slut, no argument there. Just watch the film and count how many sexual relations she talks about, your a joke if you don't think she isn't. The part about this that hit me the most was, this is very much a real thing, just look at people now-a-days. How would you react if your girlfriend or boyfriend was a whore, it's disgusting to think about. I would have taken Holden's side, even though his proposal in the end was a very dumb thing to do. Of course she truly did love him, but hey, she did some sick things, that no amount of Listerine can wash away. I probably would have just walked away from it. I for one have zero tolerance for loose women, so yeah it's understandable. Then people will cry, she was trying to find that someone, so a threesome is finding that someone, making a dirty film is finding that someone, sleeping around is finding that someone. BS, that's called being a slut, plain and simple, there is no argument. People like this spread diseases, it's not so bad being a virgin.Anyway, the film should have ended after the apartment proposal, because the rest doesn't make it any less depressing.

It's a low-key Vietnam War drama about the kidnapping, rape, and murder of a Vietnamese girl at the hands of a group of US soldiers.The film focuses on Michael J.Fox who plays Erikkson,a naïve soldier who has only been in Vietnam for three weeks. His Sergeant is played by Sean Penn,a tough,efficient soldier who is just about hanging onto his sanity amongst the chaos and destruction that's going on around him.Whilst relaxing in a village,Meserve's closest friend,and radio operator,Brownie,is shot,and later dies. This is the point where Merserve starts to lose it. And when he and the rest of his men are refused entry into a brothel,he decides to kidnap a local village girl and use her as their sex slave.Brian De Palma proves again what a masterful filmmaker he is,in scene after scene,shot after shot. The film is grim,and disturbing in many parts,but his style and cinematography is so good, it's difficult to look away from. This was a film that he'd been wanting to make for years,and you can tell when you watch the film that he was passionate about it,and wasn't just interested in showing sex,or violence for the sake of exploitation,or just to shock,which he has been accused of sometimes.For instance the rape sequence is brilliantly filmed. It goes without saying that rape scenes are always uncomfortable to watch, but the rape scene here is surprisingly the least graphic I've seen from a visual point of view. There's hardly any nudity,and there's no close-ups of the sex act. However, emotionally it is one of the most disturbing. Partly because there's such a long build up to it. As soon as the girl has been kidnapped, we know what her fate is going to be. Partly because it's a group of soldiers that are committing the act on her, and partly because De Palma films it in a way that puts the audience in Erikkson's place. While the rape goes on,he is helplessly on look out duty, and it's filmed from his point of view as he watches the soldiers from a distance in the hut, taking it in turns with the girl. We feel what Eriksson feels, horrified and angry. It's a disturbing yet stunning piece of filmmaking and Ennio Morricone's haunting music makes it even more effective. We don't see Erikkson again until the moment when Meserve approaches him,and then we finally get a close-up of his face. This is the moment where Erikkson has become demoralised.His face speaks volumes about what he's seen. The moment where the girl is killed is equally unsettling. Again, De Palma avoids sensational violence and shows the girl been stabbed in the distance behind Erikkson as he is taking out the Vietcong with his rifle and doesn't even notice what is going on behind him. The close-up of the girl been shot dead is shocking and filmed again from Erikkson's point of view, as he witnesses this tragedy whilst trying to prevent her death.The third and final section of the film focuses on Erikkson's attempts to bring his comrades to justice. This was a part of the film that I felt lacked something in the theatrical version but now thanks to the extended cut, I think it's just as powerful as the events leading up to it. There's only 6 minutes of extra footage but it adds to it. There's a scene where Erikkson is interrogated by two Military agents that was missing before. It's a great scene because it now explains how the investigation began after Erikkson's Captain and Lieutenant tried to dismiss it. Again, De Palma films the interview well with one long tracking shot.And the courtroom scene is brilliant too. While each of the four guilty soldiers are been prosecuted,we are not shown anybody else in the room,we just see each of the soldiers and hear the voices of the lawyers. It's also one of the most shocking moments because it's the moment when these criminals are shown in all their glory. Obviously you never forget that they are soldiers during the events leading up to their trial, but all through the kidnapping they are rough and dirty unshaven.Here they are clean and shaved, dressed in their formal uniform and wearing their medals but it doesn't change the fact that they are rapists and murderers. The extra scene here shows Erikkson been cross-examined. It further drives home the point that even though Erikkson didn't take part in the incident, he failed to save her, and he feels as guilty as if he did take part in it and it will ultimately haunt him for the rest of his life.Michael J.fox doesn't belong in a serious War film but he's perfectly cast here. His youthful looks work for the part of the innocent, naive young soldier ,and his short stature works for the ordinary,everyday man caught up in an unthinkable situation. His acting his outstanding throughout. He does have a few bits of clunky dialogue,but it's not his fault,it's the writer David Rabe who actually served in Vietnam, trying to get some moral points across. Fox handles it well. But it's mainly his subtlety I was impressed with throughout. His expressions speak volumes. I've never been a fan of Sean Penn. I've always found him to be an overrated,scenery-chewing actor and I still feel he's the same here. But I think it kind of works this time because of the extremes of the situation his character is in.This is a thought-provoking, powerful piece of cinema that shows the best and worst traits of human behaviour. It's a difficult film to watch at times but I've seen it many times because of the performances and film-making. It's a masterpiece.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, War"},{"date":"10 July 2013","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" I am not usually a fan of War films, but this is not a typical War film.It's not a grand-scale action movie with big battle scenes. It's a low-key Vietnam War drama about the kidnapping, rape, and murder of a Vietnamese girl at the hands of a group of US soldiers.The film focuses on Michael J.Fox who plays Erikkson,a naïve soldier who has only been in Vietnam for three weeks. His Sergeant is played by Sean Penn,a tough,efficient soldier who is just about hanging onto his sanity amongst the chaos and destruction that's going on around him.Whilst relaxing in a village,Meserve's closest friend,and radio operator,Brownie,is shot,and later dies. This is the point where Merserve starts to lose it. And when he and the rest of his men are refused entry into a brothel,he decides to kidnap a local village girl and use her as their sex slave.Brian De Palma proves again what a masterful filmmaker he is,in scene after scene,shot after shot. The film is grim,and disturbing in many parts,but his style and cinematography is so good, it's difficult to look away from. This was a film that he'd been wanting to make for years,and you can tell when you watch the film that he was passionate about it,and wasn't just interested in showing sex,or violence for the sake of exploitation,or just to shock,which he has been accused of sometimes.For instance the rape sequence is brilliantly filmed. It goes without saying that rape scenes are always uncomfortable to watch, but the rape scene here is surprisingly the least graphic I've seen from a visual point of view. There's hardly any nudity,and there's no close-ups of the sex act. However, emotionally it is one of the most disturbing. Partly because there's such a long build up to it. As soon as the girl has been kidnapped, we know what her fate is going to be. Partly because it's a group of soldiers that are committing the act on her, and partly because De Palma films it in a way that puts the audience in Erikkson's place. While the rape goes on,he is helplessly on look out duty, and it's filmed from his point of view as he watches the soldiers from a distance in the hut, taking it in turns with the girl. We feel what Eriksson feels, horrified and angry. It's a disturbing yet stunning piece of filmmaking and Ennio Morricone's haunting music makes it even more effective. We don't see Erikkson again until the moment when Meserve approaches him,and then we finally get a close-up of his face. This is the moment where Erikkson has become demoralised.His face speaks volumes about what he's seen. The moment where the girl is killed is equally unsettling. Again, De Palma avoids sensational violence and shows the girl been stabbed in the distance behind Erikkson as he is taking out the Vietcong with his rifle and doesn't even notice what is going on behind him. The close-up of the girl been shot dead is shocking and filmed again from Erikkson's point of view, as he witnesses this tragedy whilst trying to prevent her death.The third and final section of the film focuses on Erikkson's attempts to bring his comrades to justice. This was a part of the film that I felt lacked something in the theatrical version but now thanks to the extended cut, I think it's just as powerful as the events leading up to it. There's only 6 minutes of extra footage but it adds to it. There's a scene where Erikkson is interrogated by two Military agents that was missing before. It's a great scene because it now explains how the investigation began after Erikkson's Captain and Lieutenant tried to dismiss it. Again, De Palma films the interview well with one long tracking shot.And the courtroom scene is brilliant too. While each of the four guilty soldiers are been prosecuted,we are not shown anybody else in the room,we just see each of the soldiers and hear the voices of the lawyers. It's also one of the most shocking moments because it's the moment when these criminals are shown in all their glory.

I saw it on a 43 set on a by-now very old DVD in my parents' bedroom, after my mom had recently come home from the hospital after surgery. One night, my dad came home from the library with some DVDs, and one of them was Poltergeist. I popped it into the DVD player without hesitation because I'd wanted to see it since I was five. I knew from the moment it started, Poltergeist was going to be a great movie, but little did I know it would become my favorite movie of all time, and I'd want to experience it again and again.Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams star in this classic as Steve and Diane Freeling, who live with their three children, sixteen-year-old Dana (Dominique Dunne), eight-year-old Robbie (Oliver Robins), and five-year-old Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke) in Cuesta Verde, CA, soon learn that their home is haunted, and also that the spirits talk to Carol Anne through their television. Everything seems normal at first. Dana gives construction workers the finger and talks on the phone later than she's supposed to, Robbie is a huge Star Wars fan, and Carol Anne feeds her goldfish an entire tube of food. One night, a tree tries to eat Robbie, but Steve quickly saves him. When the ghosts kidnap Carol Anne through the closet, they are forced to fight the evil spirit that holds their daughter if they ever want to see her again. Well-acted, well-written, and well-directed, with great special effects, Poltergeist is the greatest ghost story put on film. Let's start with the acting. The performances are top-notch. The way lines are said, the facial expressions, body language, everything about the characters feels real. Craig T. Nelson plays Steve, a husband and father who's willing to do anything to save his family, so believably, nothing about it feels fake. JoBeth Williams plays Diane, a distraught mother, so believably, you'll believe what's happening on screen is hurting her. Heather O'Rourke gives the best performance by a five-year-old ever. Zelda Rubinstein is also great. It doesn't even seem like they're acting. The special effects still hold up, because they still look real. The plot is still very original, because it's set in modern suburban America, and it's about a normal family that loves each other, rather than an abusive husband and father. Poltergeist is so well-written that nobody has to die, nor does it have to be gory to keep us on the edge of our seats. Spielberg and Hooper keep it subtle by hardly showing the ghosts. Poltergeist features a great plot, great acting, great directing, and great writing. I can't recommend Poltergeist enough. Poltergeist is a kid's movie, so it's not all that scary, though there are scenes that may scare you or creep you out, but you won't be scarred for life. In the end it really is a fun thrill ride. Poltergeist is a movie every kid must see by the time they're eight years old. For some reason, I find myself trying to hold back tears every time I see it.Poltergeist is my favorite movie of all time, it is a timeless classic, and it still holds up after over thirty years because it remains a thrilling, warmhearted, and poignant movie experience. Poltergeist tells the story of a family nothing can tear apart. It's a classic good versus evil story, a story of perseverance in spite of your worst fears coming to light, and holding it together in spite of everything seeming to fall apart. It's about never giving up hope. When I watched Craig T. Nelson, I saw my dad on that screen, and I see him on that screen even more now. When I watched JoBeth Williams, I saw my mom on that screen, and I see her on that screen even more now. I know you're probably worried because of things you've read online about it being scary, gory, or boring, but don't be. Gory? Never. Scary? Not at all. Boring? Don't make me laugh. Despite everything that happens, there's a sense of hope, a warmth, that stays the entire movie, and honestly, I think that's what keeps us coming back. Poltergeist has a heart, and that's why it still holds up all these years after its release.

It's like garnering a seat in a sports stadium to your favourite team and being allowed to watch a decent game of whatever before it was all so crudely ruined by big business and monetary venture. It's like being allowed to step back in time to an era when a specific nation was once bigger and better than what it has succumbed into being in the present; like being allowed to experience music when it was at its purest and freshest and at its time of release away from pop culture dilution. Put pure and simply, Dr. No is one of the better films of the James Bond series, a series which began small but thought big before gradually disintegrating into something which had completely outgrown its roots only to think small. To an extent, Dr. No is one of the better Bond films, but then it was always going to be - to disagree is, in a sense, a fallacy for how could something such as the Bond series run for so long if its early works were not as good as they were? There is an old fashioned strain to things here, just as there was to sport from decades ago; sport which often featured people who were plying their game second to another job and had to make the most of their run in the team for the meagre pay they might have received. The huffs and puffs of a county cricketer or a league footballer trying their damnedest here ring out in the form of narrative and actual filmmaking, whereby atmosphere and mystery take precedence over slick, production line aesthetics and people channelling more-so creating. This is the Bond film free of the things that later characterised the franchise for the worst; characteristics which would often form the basis of what a Bond film would look like rather than what a film film should look like. That is to say, audiences and their expectations regarding a set of key conventions including attractive girls; outlandish gadgets and sumptuous locations instead of the things that define the cornerstone of cinema narrative; character; direction and so forth. When, in 1987's The Living Daylights, producers tried to take it back with a grotty East German-set opening that featured a bombardment of plot and our hero haring away from an international crime scene in an Audi, it was just too much for some people.There is, of course, one or two of these things in Dr. No but such things seem to merely arrive naturally and seamlessly more-so shoehorned in. Take, nearer the end, the period synonymous with most Bond films when the big assault on the villain's lair commences. Bond only bumps into a scantily-clad newfound heroine once near this base having already arrived there with an allied gentleman days earlier. When she comes out of the sea under the sweltering sun, what else do we expect her to wear? Nowadays, Bond would've traversed the island with the heroine initially in tow while her latex jumpsuit would've been unyielding to her character enough like it were her second skin. Now take the film's tropical location being what it is, but witness how it makes perfect sense for a super-villain to base his operations there when desiring to tamper with produce as close as Florida. Dr. No actually contains a scene nearer the beginning of its famous lead's latest case whereby Sean Connery's James Bond has to walk around a crime scene and investigate things. There's a sense of detection to proceedings, the man is investigating a death and must look for clues at the scene of the crime.This crime is the murder of a British Intelligence officer, a man who is gunned down during an organised hit in the Caribbean nation of Jamaica at the bereft of a well organised gang of natives. The man investigating it is Bond, James Bond &#x96; a man whose opening utterance of his name is, fittingly, designed to be a suave and cutting response to an equally debonair woman who announces her own name as if to snide him. Bond is a character who the producers must take the time to introduce. We're told he's a golfer; it's evident he enjoys casinos and it becomes fairly obvious he's comfortable in talking to women. Through dialogue, we learn he's been doing his job for ten years and came through the ranks of intelligence to get to where he is now. Once deployed, Bond sets about uncovering the facts and what transpires is the sort of power play and tension between two very specific sides that is largely vacant in contemporary Bond films, let alone most other espionage thrillers.We observe Bond build friendships, make allies &#x96; we see him develop enemies and we witness him fight through the sludge that comes with the complexity of the case while question what draws someone Chinese to these shores in the first place. There is an odd anticipation to the film, to its scenes; an atmosphere. There is mystery behind No's island, an appealing omnipresent tone as things unravel. The film is driven by Connery's electric performance, a performance that brings to life a man who's so into what he does that when he's depicted invading a known mole's apartment, we witness him construct a trap designed to show them up to a cheesy long-play record in a manner that is positively sociopathic &#x96; and yet, there is nary any evil in what he does it's merely his job and his job and he enjoys his job. The film is a bullish spy thriller, seemingly devoid of what makes most of its ilk nowadays as frustrating as they usually are and full of the good stuff. It's difficult not to recommend Dr. No. ","genre":null},{"date":"10 July 2013","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Watching Dr. No now is like being allowed a mystical, perverse access to what something was like before it was made famous and, some might say, ruined.

It's difficult not to recommend Dr. No. ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller"},{"date":"10 July 2013","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Watching Dr. No now is like being allowed a mystical, perverse access to what something was like before it was made famous and, some might say, ruined. It's like garnering a seat in a sports stadium to your favourite team and being allowed to watch a decent game of whatever before it was all so crudely ruined by big business and monetary venture. It's like being allowed to step back in time to an era when a specific nation was once bigger and better than what it has succumbed into being in the present; like being allowed to experience music when it was at its purest and freshest and at its time of release away from pop culture dilution. Put pure and simply, Dr. No is one of the better films of the James Bond series, a series which began small but thought big before gradually disintegrating into something which had completely outgrown its roots only to think small. To an extent, Dr. No is one of the better Bond films, but then it was always going to be - to disagree is, in a sense, a fallacy for how could something such as the Bond series run for so long if its early works were not as good as they were? There is an old fashioned strain to things here, just as there was to sport from decades ago; sport which often featured people who were plying their game second to another job and had to make the most of their run in the team for the meagre pay they might have received. The huffs and puffs of a county cricketer or a league footballer trying their damnedest here ring out in the form of narrative and actual filmmaking, whereby atmosphere and mystery take precedence over slick, production line aesthetics and people channelling more-so creating. This is the Bond film free of the things that later characterised the franchise for the worst; characteristics which would often form the basis of what a Bond film would look like rather than what a film film should look like. That is to say, audiences and their expectations regarding a set of key conventions including attractive girls; outlandish gadgets and sumptuous locations instead of the things that define the cornerstone of cinema narrative; character; direction and so forth. When, in 1987's The Living Daylights, producers tried to take it back with a grotty East German-set opening that featured a bombardment of plot and our hero haring away from an international crime scene in an Audi, it was just too much for some people.There is, of course, one or two of these things in Dr. No but such things seem to merely arrive naturally and seamlessly more-so shoehorned in. Take, nearer the end, the period synonymous with most Bond films when the big assault on the villain's lair commences. Bond only bumps into a scantily-clad newfound heroine once near this base having already arrived there with an allied gentleman days earlier. When she comes out of the sea under the sweltering sun, what else do we expect her to wear? Nowadays, Bond would've traversed the island with the heroine initially in tow while her latex jumpsuit would've been unyielding to her character enough like it were her second skin. Now take the film's tropical location being what it is, but witness how it makes perfect sense for a super-villain to base his operations there when desiring to tamper with produce as close as Florida. Dr. No actually contains a scene nearer the beginning of its famous lead's latest case whereby Sean Connery's James Bond has to walk around a crime scene and investigate things. There's a sense of detection to proceedings, the man is investigating a death and must look for clues at the scene of the crime.This crime is the murder of a British Intelligence officer, a man who is gunned down during an organised hit in the Caribbean nation of Jamaica at the bereft of a well organised gang of natives. The man investigating it is Bond, James Bond &#x96; a man whose opening utterance of his name is, fittingly, designed to be a suave and cutting response to an equally debonair woman who announces her own name as if to snide him. Bond is a character who the producers must take the time to introduce. We're told he's a golfer; it's evident he enjoys casinos and it becomes fairly obvious he's comfortable in talking to women.

Not all relationships end up quite the same as the couple in this movie, but it certainly makes you think, what could we have done differently to make it work?Bruce Willis's performance was truly outstanding.

I've always been a big fan of Tim Burton, his Big Fish was my first taste of what cinema could be, but even though this film was during the peak of his power, it's still a big let down. It has an insanely huge cast of talent with Jack Nicholson (in two roles), Glenn Close, Natalie Portman, Annette Bening, Michael J. Fox, Danny DeVito, Rod Steiger and many more, all given stock desires and conflicts with none particularly focused on and few resolved. The cast was why I watched it as well as the fact that it's on my watchlist from university in regards to music in film so it was worth watching in some regard but despite my low expectations it was still quite a disappointment.The first half is significantly better than the eye-rolling second, even though not much plot development is made. It's spent slowly setting up all the characters and humanity's reaction to martians. It's quite amusing at times, but never laugh out loud, feeling like it's completely comprised of the quirky side characters of Burton's other films and lacking the protagonist to root for. It's all pretty half decent for what it is, but unfortunately it has horrible and flat special effects which it relies on more than anything. Maybe it was the best of its kind at the time (though Independence Day in the same year was far superior), this is very primitive and most of the time it doesn't look like it belongs in the film's reality. Even some of the non-CGI effects are very poor. Perhaps this was more than Burton could handle or producers intervened, but it doesn't work and he should've tried for a stop motion or puppet effect.It does have some good elements. Danny Elfman's creative score is the biggest part of the homage to the 1950s sci-fi and that music plays a big theme in the story. While the score features the theremin prominently as the alien's signature sound, calling back to The Day The Earth Stood Still, it is the in film pseudo-country music that defeats the aliens. This suggests the idea, regarding pop culture, of what is now considered ordinary, the eeriness of the theremin over the country. However, contrivances in the script are very bothersome and ruin most of its execution. There's little sense of escalation from the first half to the second.

Unfortunately, the charmless Bob the Gambler falls flat. The qualities I've enjoyed in his subsequent films, which I focused on the most, were incredibly inconsistent and near amateur. The grating cinematography mistakes stood out the most, not because of the framing, which was often nice, but the position of the camera from shot to shot completely lost spatial awareness and clearly unintentionally broke rules that this film could not get away with ending up as a huge distraction. It was packed with inexplicably jarring editing, if mostly due to the cinematography, if not then there seemed to be hints of homages to the mediocre gangster films of the '20s and early '30s. There was lots of unsettling axial cuts, time jumps and a pointless use of wipes and irises, which mostly felt ridiculous and destroyed any tension the film could have had. It also had bizarre musical cues in the score that rendered the film near parody.However, I did enjoy the moral compass regarding how Bob earns money, and sees how others should earn money. It was a plot arc that wrapped up very nicely and intelligently, even though due to the style issues, I struggled to invest in the character. There's a very interesting network of characters with interlocking problems which sometimes worked quite well when I could figure out who was who, but unfortunately it didn't emphasise the hierarchy enough for it to matter. Overall, the erratic technical nature works against the films intended tone, and ends up just a mess with some neat ideas that Melville would later develop better in his subsequent films. I don't know why this is acclaimed, perhaps it was beyond its time, but it just doesn't feel like a professional effort.

A future Earth is in the throes of a military conflict with another world; Alpha Centauri, and the methods of war know no rules; all's fair in love and war, as the saying goes. When conventional means and methods fail to breach Earth defenses, more subtlety is called for.I had a hard time with this film because it portrays one cliché after another; a future fascist like Earthly society where people live a regimented lifestyle where things are either drab gray or in black and white. There is no hope when war is waged, is the message here, and the action sequences to inject energy into this film are taken from all the other formulaic films that have been in the theatres over the last twenty years. Guns, martial arts, super-spy devices, pseudo-SWAT behavior, the list goes on and on of one action film cliché after another. The only thing missing was a car chase.The actors did a fine job. You can't fault them. The story by Phillip K. Dick was an interesting premise, and I think it works too. But the art direction and screenplay needed major adjustments, as well as some of the general direction. In short, the man guiding things behind the camera is not a sci-fi film maker, but an action film maker in Hollywood styleings given a sci-fi script to shoot.To me this film comes across as an elaborate episode of CSI with a dash of a futuristic war to set the stage. I never got the sense that I was experiencing a future society so much as an alternate reality with the notion of a war tacked on as an after thought to give the story plausibility. And, again, we have space Nazis; Hollywood's favorite fetish for bad guys on the big silver screen, including a reference to storm-troopers Might not the Centauris just be aliens who want something we have?

I grew up with this movie. I was 5 when it came out and it's in my earliest memories of watching it on the Sunday Night Movie. I've watched the quality of it progress as media technology has progressed. People say it's too long and I might agree with that. The scenes entering the cloud could have been cut down, but I think the director tried his best at creating an epic storyline and almost pulled it off. The movie isn't action packed but it's intelligent. They managed to take Star Trek in directions they hadn't or couldn't in the TV show. Panning over the ship for a full instrumental sequence was long winded but it was the first time anyone had seen the ship up close for the first time and in that context it has to be appreciated. The story took the time to answer simple questions a lot of people had pondered like what would it be like if the transporter malfunctioned and what if the warp drive malfunctioned mid-warp. The twist at the end was brilliant, in my opinion. It was a slower movie, but I still feel it kept a steady pace. People say it was too serious, but there's quite a few little jokes along the way.The music in it is top notch. The movie was made during a time when musical scores where just as much of a character in a movie as the rest of the cast. This movie is no exception. The federation theme music was good enough for The Next Generation to use it for the show's theme music. It does a great job of creating mood as well as greatly enhancing the atmosphere of all the important scenes.I guess to sum it up, I wouldn't use this movie to introduce someone to Star Trek. I would however try and put myself in the place of someone who had jumped on the series bandwagon way back when and was finally experiencing the long awaited movie for the first time in the theater on opening day! That excitement and nostalgia blended together must have been amazing and trying to capture that while watching the movie would greatly enhance the experience of someone who successfully accomplishes it. I gave it a 9 and not a 10 because it does have some sketchy editing in a couple places where there could have been better continuity.

Jamie Lee Curtis presumably had better things to do so her character has been bumped off and in her place is Danielle Harris as her daughter, with Donald Pleasence returning to go through the motions. Needless to say the original 'Halloween' had a sense of style and purpose sorely lacking in this artless pile, which bestows upon Myers the ability to teleport through locked doors, magically appear in getaway trucks and stand in the middle of the road without being seen.It's a lazy, witless film, basically, cobbled together from pieces of the earlier movies and lacking in internal logic. The plot, which somehow needed four writers to scrawl, is so desperate for scares in a plot that doesn't have any that it scrapes by on dream sequences and false alarms like the scene where a bunch of kids dress up as Myers. It's all very dull.The movie contains my least favourite stock character in the horror genre, the peripheral figure who somehow knows what's going on in this case, a preacher doing a bizarre impression of John Carradine, who tells Pleasence 'You can't kill damnation, mister!' But he's a subtle guy compared to the guard at the mental institution who warns that 'Jesus ain't got nothing' to with this place' and 'this is where society dumps its worst nightmares' and 'welcome to hell'. The dialogue... isn't very good.On a more positive note, the ending is quite chilling; on another negative note, it comes out of nowhere and doesn't make much sense. I suppose if you gauge the success of a 'Halloween' film on how many empty deaths it contains than 'Halloween 4' delivers the goods, but if you want something scary or suspenseful or effective, look elsewhere.

I decided with the older version as it is the one whose snapshots came up while I was searching for the cover of my book to feature in my book review.The movie starts with a series of black and white pictures over sound. We deduce from them that it is set in England, that a war, probably a nuclear war, has started and that kids are being evacuated by plane. We hear a crash. The next scene, we see two kids on a beach and they wonder if there are any adults left. They start by getting everyone's name. They find a shell in the sea, that the young boy who is only referred to as Piggy, informs them is a conch. In order to have everyone gather, Ralph blows the conch and they decide who should be the leader. While Ralph is soon elected leader, another boy, Jack, who lives only to hunt the wild pigs on the island, soon threatens the power of both the conch and Ralph.The film is a quite good adaptation. It is very faithful to the text and apart from two scenes, I couldn't really see many differences.I was annoyed by a few things however. First of all, I felt the music and sounds weren't fitting the atmosphere. I also think the scenes that lead up to a sort of communal frenzy among the boys were so frantic they lost all sense of realism. It simply didn't seem to fit. Last but not least, I think the acting was fairly poor. I understand that an ensemble cast of young boys is not the easiest thing to manage but a lot of overacting ensued which took away from the film's credibility.The movie, which was extensively cut, was a good telling of the book and I felt they did pick out the key scenes from it in order to form a compact, yet linear and understandable tale. When seeing a movie from a book you have read, it tends to be a great disappointment when some of your favorite scenes go missing or when you feel the movie isn't understandable as a whole because of some involvements cleared out in the book, but that didn't happen here.In many ways it reminded me of the French film La guerre des boutons (1962) but if had to recommend only one, I'd go with the French one.

What I mean is  maybe it's only us.Since I just finished reading the book last night, it felt natural for me to check out the movie. I decided with the older version as it is the one whose snapshots came up while I was searching for the cover of my book to feature in my book review.The movie starts with a series of black and white pictures over sound. We deduce from them that it is set in England, that a war, probably a nuclear war, has started and that kids are being evacuated by plane. We hear a crash. The next scene, we see two kids on a beach and they wonder if there are any adults left. They start by getting everyone's name. They find a shell in the sea, that the young boy who is only referred to as Piggy, informs them is a conch. In order to have everyone gather, Ralph blows the conch and they decide who should be the leader. While Ralph is soon elected leader, another boy, Jack, who lives only to hunt the wild pigs on the island, soon threatens the power of both the conch and Ralph.The film is a quite good adaptation. It is very faithful to the text and apart from two scenes, I couldn't really see many differences.I was annoyed by a few things however. First of all, I felt the music and sounds weren't fitting the atmosphere. I also think the scenes that lead up to a sort of communal frenzy among the boys were so frantic they lost all sense of realism. It simply didn't seem to fit. Last but not least, I think the acting was fairly poor. I understand that an ensemble cast of young boys is not the easiest thing to manage but a lot of overacting ensued which took away from the film's credibility.The movie, which was extensively cut, was a good telling of the book and I felt they did pick out the key scenes from it in order to form a compact, yet linear and understandable tale. When seeing a movie from a book you have read, it tends to be a great disappointment when some of your favorite scenes go missing or when you feel the movie isn't understandable as a whole because of some involvements cleared out in the book, but that didn't happen here.In many ways it reminded me of the French film La guerre des boutons (1962) but if had to recommend only one, I'd go with the French one. I think, even though Lord of the Flies' addresses far more serious cultural criticism than the, mostly, comedic relief of its French counterpart, the acting of the ensemble cast is far better in La guerre des boutons.I liked Faithful to the book.
