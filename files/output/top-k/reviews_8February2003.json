Simply, this election takes place in an American high school and it must elect a student for the following role the president's board of the students. This is what Reese Witherspoon would like to become and she stands in this election. But one of his teachers, Matthew Broderick isn't prepared to accept that and in order to stand in her way, he asks one of his students, Chris Klein to stand fin the election. Broderick asked him to do this because he knows that Klein is very appreciated in the high school for his good mood and his happiness. And so, things get hard... It's obvious that Klein hasn't got Witherspoon's ambitions. He comes from a wealthy family and aspires to a quiet and idle life. Whereas Tammy Metzler, Klein's sister, well it's more in an idea of revenge and jealousy against her brother (he unvoluntarily charmed Metzler's lover who is a lesbian) that she applies for being president.Election is, of course a satiric comedy that deregulates the bases of an election. All in all, people and especially teenagers don't get interested in it because it brings nothing to their lives. It inspires them indifference and boredom, the same feelings that shine the Americans towards the political life. When Witherspoon and Klein are making their speeches (that use all the processes of the rhetoric. like political men, they're talking for saying nothing) in front of the pupils, these ones are laughing at them whereas Tammy's one provokes their happiness and enthusiasm because it's all the contrary of a banal speech. Moreover, Klein will prefer to vote for Witherspoon rather than him, this last one will find out before the verdict in front of the pupils that she won. Due to this, Matthew Broderick will try to unsettle the election's final results. As far as Matthew Broderick is concerned, well we can say that this election is the beginning of the end for him Witherspoon's despising him, he can't distinguish his private and professionnal life any more and his real intentions towards Witherspoon will earn him the personal's hate and his departure from the high school.

Now Marisa and her friends have a long history of attracting psychos, and after getting to know him, she realizes that he just may be the king of all the psycho men that she has dated yet!

However, he has an answer for every question that anyone asks him, and by the end of Kpax you are left wondering if he really was telling the truth or not.  Well this is very similar to that.

That's the way I loved watching Josie and The Pussycats...I have read the comic book in my youth years. Seeing them in flesh this time was really a treat as I saw them on the screen trying to hit big time out of their Riverdale compound (hey, this is an Archie Comic) but without knowing they will be pawns for Corporate America, who wants to control the consumer trends of young teenagers...As we see them, I reminesce with all the things we passed through in the 80s (like videoclips), the 70s (old TV and recycled Airline seats...), and of course the 90s with the boys'bands (those funny DuJour guys...) and over-corporative images (the massive product placement...).

I believe even if she is far from blockbuster star status, she gives some life here to Josie and she hands it purr-fectly. Having done two weeks of Band Camp to learn her guitar moves to make it believable and having fun while portraying Josie during the whole shooting qualifies this as being a hard-working actress who will do her best to make her caracter suitable.

Everything about it is great. For one, it is one of the most gripping love stories ever to hit the screens, and its romantic drama has rarely been matched since it was made. Same goes for the acting, which is some of the finest in film history. All of this and more will put together one of the greatest movies you will ever see. Period.Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is an ex-freedom fighter who now runs a nightclub in Casablanca, a place filled entirely with French refugees seeking unauthorized transit passes so they can escape to America. Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), who is at the top of the Nazi most wanted list, comes to Casablanca with his wife Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), a former lover of Blaine who departed him when the Nazis overtook Paris. She wants her husband to escape, but her love for Rick re-ignites, and she wants to stay in Casablanca. However, things become more dangerous for the Laszlos, and despite their revived love for each other, Rick convinces Ilsa that she must leave with her husband. He then sees her off on a plane on a fog-enshrouded runway in one of the greatest movie conclusions of all time.There are so many moments, many of which will forever be unforgotten, in Casablanca that stand out even when compared to greater or bigger films. Every scene is gripping, like when Rick has a flashback to his romantic times with Ilsa in Paris while piano player Sam (Dooley Wilson) plays As Time Goes By, or when Rick walks out onto the runway and tells Capt. Renault (Claude Rains), Louis, I think this could be the start of a beautiful friendship. But these invincible moments obviously don't need retelling, for almost everyone knows of them. As for the timeless cast, Humphrey Bogart is simply stunning as the leading man. The class, drama, and brilliance in his performance are impossible to match, although there have been countless attempts to try to surpass it. Ingrid Bergman is simply gorgeous, and contributes a performance that's worth cheering for. In fact, all of the performances in this movie will have you cheering.This is the kind of film that many other Hollywood movies have followed the footsteps of, yet probably very few have rivaled or suprassed. In a nutshell, Casablanca is a sweeping classic that will leave you breathless. From Humphrey Bogart's classy acting to the great ending, there is not a flaw to speak of. In the battle of the ultimate classics, it's not as good as Citizen Kane (despite a higher star rating, but star ratings don't speak all of the volumes in my book). But it's still a fantastic movie.

In a nutshell, Casablanca is a sweeping classic that will leave you breathless. From Humphrey Bogart's classy acting to the great ending, there is not a flaw to speak of. In the battle of the ultimate classics, it's not as good as Citizen Kane (despite a higher star rating, but star ratings don't speak all of the volumes in my book). But it's still a fantastic movie. Watch it and enjoy it. `Here's looking at you kid!'***** out of *****    ","genre":"Drama, Romance, War"},{"date":"8 February 2003","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  I had a little trouble making up my mind about the genre.

I knew they had written a book about this incident, but didn't realize they were making it into a movie. My best friend in school joined the Army shortly after high school and became a helicopter mechanic. An admirable occupation for sure, but we sure worried about him when he spent the Gulf War in Saudi Arabia\/Kuwait\/Iraq. And shortly after hearing about trouble in Somalia, he was on his way over there. I admit that before this movie, I didn't know that much about this incident. I had heard about the book, but didn't really know the details. Shortly after seeing the preview for the movie, I emailed Charlie to find out more. Yes, he was a Black Hawk Mechanic in Somalia, but he had come home shortly before this event took place. However, he did know many of the people who were involved in it. He told me about what he went through personally waiting for the outcome and how hard it was for him. His story really brought it home for me and personalized this movie like no other war movie. It was more real when seeing the soldiers injured and killed. I just watched this movie for the second time and the effect wasn't lessened. I found myself getting chills like never before when watching a war movie. The movie itself is excellently and realistically filmed. It definitely puts you in the middle of the battle. The most frustrating thing for me was watching the poor command decisions being made by guys in charge that lead to this incident being worse than it had to be. Keeping the chopper circling over head, when those on board wanted so much to get in there and help the trapped soldiers. I know the chain of command is important in the military, but sometimes I think it's important to trust the soldiers who are there in the battle. I have always had a great respect for soldiers who are willing to put their life on the line for the sake of the country, but am often frustrated by the leaders that put them in such awful situations in the first place. It's a great story of comraderie between the soldiers. The scenes where the soldiers make it back to base, but go back out again are very touching. It is so hard for me to fully comprehend having one's life depend on the randomness of where a bullet happens to fly in battle. I'm pretty sure I could handle myself as good as the next guy, but I don't ever want to be in that situation. Because if it's not you, then it's probably your buddy next to you. I definitely sleep better at night knowing Charlie has retired from the military and is now launching rockets for Boeing. I respect his service that he put in for our country, but am happy to know that I'm not going to get a phone call that he's off to some God awful part of the globe.

This movie is like Leaving Las Vegas with a Schindler's List chaser in an atmosphere of Changing Lanes!Let me explain. First of all, there is no denying that it IS an amazing movie. Darren Aronofsky is a brilliant director. Visually, the movie is unbelievable! Was it nominated for any awards for its directing? It should have been.The cast was simply amazing. Jennifer Connely was a guilty pleasure as always. Jared Leto keeps impressing me more and more each time I see him. Ellen Burstyn blew my mind. And Marlon Wayans?! Who'd a thunk a Wayans could actually ACT?!The film should have also won an award for best make up for Ellen Burstyn's character. The difference between her appearance as she envisioned herself on tv and the state that she found herself in at the end of the movie is beyond amazing. I was just as impressed with her range of appearance as I was with King Theoden's pre\/post exorcism in The Two Towers!Now, let me explain my comment at the beginning of this post where I compared Requiem with Vegas, Schindler, and Lanes. It is like Changing Lanes in that none of the characters are really likeable. Maybe that adds to the reality of it all the more, but it is hard (at least, for me) to watch a movie where you genuinely don't like any of the characters. The aspect which raised it above Lanes, however, and brought it up to the level of Vegas was that while the characters are not likeable in the least, you do genuinely care for them. The scenes where Maid Marion goes to the apartment of the guy she has the phone number for are truly heartbreaking. Especially her second visit. Seeing Sarah getting worse and worse on her medication is pitiable in its reality. And Harry's arm and the agony it causes him is too realistic and I found myself longing for the point where he finally has it treated at the end of the film.This all brings me to the final comparison with another film. Requiem is like Schindler's List in that it is both very realistic (I would say that both Schindler and Requiem are films that every person should see) AND very depressing. Luckily I also rented Beneath Loch Ness, a B-grade movie that will hopefully bring me back to a state of emotional equilibrium.All in all, I 'm glad that I saw it, but I refuse to say that it was a movie that I enjoyed.

Many viewers have said that Unfaithful is simply a role reversal of Lyne's earlier hit Fatal Attraction. It might be accurate but I don't think it's totally a fair comparison. I felt that the affair between Connie Sumner (Diane Lane) and Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez) was just a basic physical attraction. It was a need that, for some reason, was not met with her husband. At the same time, the affair became more of an addiction for Connie. There's no love at all in that relationship. There is love between Connie and Edward (Richard Gere) but from what is presented on the screen, their love is on low tide. They certainly took each other for granted. What impressed me the most about Unfaithful was that director Lyne and screenwriters Alvin Sargent & William Broyles, Jr. (adapted from Claude Chabrol's La Femme Infidèle) did not shy away from the consequences of having an affair. There was no easy out for Connie and Edward and no tidy endings. Gere was O.K. That's not to say he was bad. He didn't impress me very much. It was odd but rather interesting to see him play this rather drab, nerdy character. Something to consider if the movie was remade in the late 70s or early 80s, Gere definitely would've played the other man. I was angry at Connie for having an affair and betraying her family. I also felt some sympathy toward her She was not a bad person. She's basically a good person who made some very bad choices. One sequence that stood out for me (and apparently for many others) was when Connie is on the commuter train heading back home after her second encounter with Paul. Her facial expressions are so subtle but also tells more about what's going on with her with no dialog. The reactions range from excitement to anger to resignation to fear.(In the Special Features section of the DVD, check out the interview with veteran film editor Anne V. Coates. She brings an interesting perspective on how she was able to edit the sequence.)Diane Lane has received many well-deserved accolades for her performance.

Of course, there have been times when she couldn't sprinkle enough fairy dust to create even the illusion of charm, such as in the tragically awful Speed 2 Cruise Control and the awkward, best left undiscovered Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.Fortunately, Miss Congeniality has just the right amount of real comedy at its heart, albeit encased in a cliche skeleton, for Bullock to bring out what's really good about it.FBI agent Gracie Hart is a coarse, hostile person entirely out of touch with her femininity. Her dinners are three-minute insta-meals which she cooks in a microwave, the door of which she wedges shut with a spatula because it won't close all the way. She spends her evenings working out frustrations on a punching bag, and gets into trouble with her boss for breaking rules on the job.But when duty calls, she reluctantly accepts the assignment to go undercover as a contestant (from New Jersey, of course) in the Miss USA pageant under the supervision of Benjamin Bratt, her fellow agent, and Michael Caine, the Professor Higgins of pageantry who will guide her through a Pygmalion-like transformation into a frothy beauty who just wants world peace. Of course, Gracie doesn't do all that very gracefully as she trips over heels, demeans baton-twirling to a baton-twirler, and alienates the pageant directors with her contempt for the scholarship program that is the Miss USA competition.Will Gracie catch the bad guys who are bent on terrorizing the pageant? Will she discover the beauty within? Will she and her handsome supervisor acknowledge the feelings they have for each other deep inside? Gee, whatever will happen?This is a formula movie, and the answers to those questions are knowable from the start.

Most didn't saw that the movie wasn't about some guys using ALOT of drugs and doing weird things. It's about a man who would have wanted to stay in the 60's for ever. This didn't happen and he wounded up in the 70's. A time he couldn't identify himself with. He travel's to Las Vegas with his lawyer and a huge amount of drugs to cover a motor race. The movie is based on the non fictional book from Hunter S Thompson. Thompson was Raoul Duke. Most things really happened. Thompson was a gonzo journalist.I even saw this movie on the Christian Church list of forbidden movie's. Why ?? Because it could provoke people to use drugs ?? Then just look at the movie again. Thompson himself said You can get much higher without drugs than with them. I didn't understand it either for that matter.Drugs was his way to run from it. Run from what you might ask. Run from the American Dream. A subject not totally covered within the movie but is central in the book. The American Dream represented in Las Vegas was going there with a few hundred dollars and leave rich. The dream that everyone could get to the top. The top of what? This world turns on one word Respect. Everyone wants it but only some deserve it. The American Dream was to get Respect without giving respect to others. The way of winning in a stale Las Vegas casino and going home rich and respected. After the 60's this world went to hell. You can see it everywhere. Socialists are almost extinct. Thompson understood that and he couldn't cope with it. He used drugs to deal with it but at the same time he got into the main nerve. A merry go around in the Bazooka Circus, what he earlier described as the Sixt Reich. He wanted the worst first making it easier to cope with the rest.I myself as a 1985 born never knew what the 60's really was about. I saw the Woodstock '69 movie, I listen to Jefferson Airplain, Bob Dylan and Pink Floyd, but this book and movie made me realize what it was about.People fighting for believes they had, not in a military way. Their energy would prevail. They had set up a new religion. A one of peace, inspired by musicians and drugs. Though the new religion wave didn't made it and rolled back, resulting in this movie.K, enough for the philosophic talk, I could go on with that for hours. Let's talk about the movie. The movie is a very good adaptation from the book. Every word said in the movie is taken literally from the book. However not in the same order. This makes the movie a different story, les philosophical but still with some great points in it. It's the way Thompson would have wanted to do the trip. That would be his ideal book instead of the book he wrote which was the way it actually happened.Johny Depp puts on the strongest role in his career. The way he walks, talks, smokes, acts. It just makes you believe this is a real drug frenzy. Along next to him is Benicio del Toro the fat lawyer, coming in a good second place for best actor. Both where connected with each other. Together they where one. The drug related images where perfectly done. No one had ever before made such a real representation of a drug trip.Together along this movie is something different. A film which I can see every week just to enjoy the acting of Depp and the beautiful quote's from Hunter S Thompson.Check it out, but remember to look past it's outer shape and into the real meaning of the movie.

The American Dream represented in Las Vegas was going there with a few hundred dollars and leave rich. The dream that everyone could get to the top. The top of what? This world turns on one word Respect. Everyone wants it but only some deserve it. The American Dream was to get Respect without giving respect to others. The way of winning in a stale Las Vegas casino and going home rich and respected. After the 60's this world went to hell. You can see it everywhere. Socialists are almost extinct. Thompson understood that and he couldn't cope with it. He used drugs to deal with it but at the same time he got into the main nerve. A merry go around in the Bazooka Circus, what he earlier described as the Sixt Reich. He wanted the worst first making it easier to cope with the rest.I myself as a 1985 born never knew what the 60's really was about. I saw the Woodstock '69 movie, I listen to Jefferson Airplain, Bob Dylan and Pink Floyd, but this book and movie made me realize what it was about.People fighting for believes they had, not in a military way. Their energy would prevail. They had set up a new religion. A one of peace, inspired by musicians and drugs. Though the new religion wave didn't made it and rolled back, resulting in this movie.K, enough for the philosophic talk, I could go on with that for hours. Let's talk about the movie. The movie is a very good adaptation from the book. Every word said in the movie is taken literally from the book. However not in the same order. This makes the movie a different story, les philosophical but still with some great points in it. It's the way Thompson would have wanted to do the trip. That would be his ideal book instead of the book he wrote which was the way it actually happened.Johny Depp puts on the strongest role in his career. The way he walks, talks, smokes, acts. It just makes you believe this is a real drug frenzy. Along next to him is Benicio del Toro the fat lawyer, coming in a good second place for best actor. Both where connected with each other. Together they where one. The drug related images where perfectly done. No one had ever before made such a real representation of a drug trip.Together along this movie is something different. A film which I can see every week just to enjoy the acting of Depp and the beautiful quote's from Hunter S Thompson.Check it out, but remember to look past it's outer shape and into the real meaning of the movie. You'll be surprised...  ","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"8 February 2003","score":"","review":"  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas was never really understand by many people. Most didn't saw that the movie wasn't about some guys using ALOT of drugs and doing weird things. It's about a man who would have wanted to stay in the 60's for ever. This didn't happen and he wounded up in the 70's. A time he couldn't identify himself with. He travel's to Las Vegas with his lawyer and a huge amount of drugs to cover a motor race. The movie is based on the non fictional book from Hunter S Thompson. Thompson was Raoul Duke. Most things really happened. Thompson was a gonzo journalist.I even saw this movie on the Christian Church list of forbidden movie's. Why ?? Because it could provoke people to use drugs ?? Then just look at the movie again.

Of the few that offer intellectual as well as visual or visceral stimulation, Star Trek The Motion Picture is certainly among the best, especially now that legendary director Robert Wise has released a 'Director's Edition' which much more fully represents his original intentions (no review based on any previous version, none of which were approved by Wise, should be considered valid any longer).The plot is almost excessively simple a gigantic energy cloud of alien origin is headed toward Earth, and the starship Enterprise must find a way to communicate with it and to take whatever action is necessary.  But the point of STTMP is not the plot as such; rather, it is an examination of the balance between rationality and emotion which is vital to maintain and succor a genuinely human life (make no mistake; STTMP is, at its deepest level, about humanity, not spaceships and alien clouds).  We see here a classic tension-- between the coldly rational mind of Spock (and, beyond that, of the entity inside the cloud) and the brash emotionalism of Captain Kirk and, particularly, Dr. McCoy.  Underlining this is the one-time love affair between Commander Decker and Navigator Ilia, an affair cut off through fear of what each might have become, of the deep personal changes necessary in true mutual love.  The elements come together in the magnificent finale, in which each of the main characters confronts their own greatest need and discovers that their quests can succeed only through the transcendence of the very desires which provoked the quests in the first place.However thoughtful, the film does not lack for superb production details. Wise has edited the film much more tautly than before, so that each sequence stands in elegant balance with every other.  The trip through the cloud and over what lies at its center is among the most beautiful such things in science fiction (easily surpassing the similar moments in 2001 A Space Odyssey).  The first views of the Enterprise, shot largely from Kirk's perspective, are filmed almost as one might gaze at a long-absent lover finally seen again, slowly and sensuously and with great care not to miss anything.  The set designs are superb, and the overall cinematography polished to a high degree.  And of course Jerry Goldsmith's score, nominated for an Academy Award, remains among the finest of film scores; time and again it undergirds and enhances the action or the visuals absolutely stunningly.Star Trek The Motion Picture, like 2001 and Tarkovsky's Solaris, is not a fast-paced film, and those seeking action-packed adventure would do best to look elsewhere.  But understood as what it truly is-- a moving and powerful meditation on a fundamental dichotomy of human consciousness-- it stands as a major achievement and an almost overwhelming cinematic experience.
