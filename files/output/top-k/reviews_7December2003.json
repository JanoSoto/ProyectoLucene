I saw it for the first time in November of 2003. Those seven-odd years during which the film was hyped to death as one of the best movies ever caused a noticeable ascension in my expectations.  And unfortunately, as we all know, the more a film is touted before you see it, the more likely it is to disappoint.  Such was probably the case here.Here are a couple of main items that prevented me from liking it as much as the general American public1.  The plot of the film was solid, but I thought that it was a bit underdeveloped.  The film's runtime was just over an hour and a half, which may not seem too short, but in this case forced the main conflict to resolve itself a tad quickly.  In doing so, the writers (the Coen Brothers) failed to progress it to a truly noticeable climax or capture the type of characterization that is necessary in order for this sort of comic crime-caper to work.2. To be fair, though, the characters were very cleverly created, and very well cast (as is the case in most Coen Brothers movies).  However, only Jerry Lundegaard's character (played by William H. Macy) is given enough screentime to truly develop.  His massive amount of screentime allows the audience to eventually notice his visible inner conflict and come to grips with him as the sort of desperate, fidgety person that he is.  Frances McDormand, who won an Oscar for her role as Marge Gunderson, on the other hand, seems to just appear on the screen at one point and then disappear a little later.  She just really doesn't bring a whole lot to the table in terms of the linear plot, as she seems to go off more on tangents and rely on a thick Canadian-esque accent (one that loses its novelty very quickly) for laughs more than anything else.  Her time on screen was apparently sufficient enough to warrant her nomination in the category of Best Actress and not Best Supporting Actress, but, in my opinion, it wasn't enough to present her for much more than surface value.  Although McDormand played the part as well as anyone could have, her character was weakly written and should not have won her a nomination, let alone an Academy Award.All in all, Fargo is simply a good, watchable movie that was probably, in my case, just a victim of self-imposed over-scrutiny caused by more than half a decade of hype.  But I have the feeling that even if I had seen it when it first came out, I wouldn't be placing it in any upper-echelon categories anyway.  On a scale of 1-to-5, I'd give this one about 3.5.

He tells a tale that begins hundreds of years prior, where he was a landowner who had lost his wife and daughter.  He tells of being turned vampire by the suave killer Lestat.  However the blessing of eternal life as the undead becomes a curse.The hunky cast is clearly a major part of the reason that this film was as successful as it was &#150; the imdb voting breakdown shows it ranking highly among female groups.  However this is maybe not a fair reflection of a film that is certainly glossy and professional, but not as rich in depth as it is visually.  The plot is reasonable, I have not read the book so I can't compare, but the plot was thin for the majority of the time.  As a journey with Louis, it fails to really grip and involve and ends up being a little dull as it feels like it's going through the motions.  A big problem is that much of the plot is character driven &#150; which would be fine if the film had strong characters, but it doesn't.Instead the characters are pretty bland and lacking substance.  Louis is interesting at first when he struggles with the change, but after that he becomes all slick and starts speaking in a low, quiet voice!  Most of the vampires are the same and the relationship between them aren't well done &#150; it all feels very superficial without any meat on the bone.  The actors must carry some of the blame.  Pitt is way out of his depth and flounders with a character he is unable to bring the complexities and sorrows out of convincingly.  Cruise looks like a model and is more pretty boy than devilishly dashing &#150; his character is a fine example of what I mean by superficial.  Dunst is OK for a child but all she really does is play the role in one way.

He has long since decided he is gay but only meets men in the park for sex.  When one of the people he meets in the park toilets turns out to be none other than the hunky head boy, Steve is unsure where he stands.  However their relationship grows into lovers and they both balance the feelings brought around by secrecy and feeling like no one understands.From the sparky opening and good sense of humour, I had expected this film would just be another in the line of Richard Curtis-lite style of British romantic comedies.  Indeed it does have this feel to it throughout - it has some good songs on the soundtrack and much of it is funny in that bittersweet way that British rom-coms seem to have claimed as their own. However what made this such a good film is the fact that it is a lot more sensitive and moving than most of this genre ends up being.  The plot may well drag a little at times, but it never really seems unrealistic or dull.The characters are part of the reason it does so well.  It is rare in the mainstream to see gay characters portrayed fairly and without caricature - HBO's 6 Feet Under is one of the rare ones, but this does as well.  I wish that all those who hold up `Will & Grace' as a milestone in gays in the mainstream could all sit and see how much better it is when done like this! The dialogue is good and none of the characters are fake or pointless.  Of course some react the way you expect them to, but the fact that they have been drawn well stops them being lazy - just broad.  The film is weak in some pretty important areas however.  The main one being the lack of relationship between Steven and John - I never saw them together and all they had in common is their sexuality.The cast do pretty well with the characters, even if some of them are being held up by the good script.  Silverstone is great in the lead - he gives a really low key performance that even extents to his `speech' scene - where he could have really hammed it up some.  Gorton is not as good but does do sterling work.  The support cast are mixed although all do their jobs ably enough.Overall this is a great little film that will never get the same success as the Richard Curtis comedies from which it borrows a bit of it's style, however the script is really strong and it is quite unarming in how well it deals with the issues without cliché or lazy caricature of characters.

What you see is not more important in Hamlet than what you hear (or think or imagine). For this, in Shakesperean time, there were little settings on the stage. First of all, it was impossible to set the stage with props and furniture. Thus, Shakespeare supported his plays by adding extra verse which described the setting to the audience. This restriction freed Shakesperean theatre from putting the plays under several stage restraints  so that it came nearer to temporary movies in its fast editing.So why do I complain about its lightning? Still, I'm complaining about its lightning because Branagah ignored the stage conditions of the Shakesperean time. He used brilliantly lit, overfilled settings which bothers our eyes with its 18th century decoration and  fashion which is a distraction because the verse has enough decoration and description.Also, by ignoring the setting conditions of Shakesperean time, Branagah misses the chance to visualise the tragic look of the play. If Branagah used a low key lightning with strong contrast (i.e. dark and light together), the movie would seem more grotesque as it is.For me, the time shift of the play from ancient times to the 18th century is also useless and perturbing.

Well, that person's seen The Godfather. Ever had a former one-night stand try to inflict long-running physical and psychological pain on you and your family? Err...probably not, but if you haven't seen 1987's Fatal Attraction, you're missing out on one of the biggest pop-culture phenomenons of recent decades.Because of Swimfan and other subpar (but, in Swimfan's case, guiltily entertaining) efforts of tribute and homage, the plot of Fatal Attraction (and maybe even its ending) is obvious before the movie even starts. Adrian Lyne's (last year's magnificent Unfaithful) film is about Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas), a New York lawyer with an attractive wife (Anne Archer) and little girl who takes a walk on the wild side one weekend and has a passionate liason with an originally casual acquaintance, Alex Forrest (Glenn Close). Dan wants it all to be over right afterwards, but Alex doesn't let him cut it off that quickly. Dan begins being harrassed by Alex in mounting forms of revenge that eventually reach his family - and become deadly (cheesy writing, huh?). Alex's continual acts of vengeance aren't easy to fight back against, though, for Dan must try to keep his secret from his wife and deal with the moral and legal implications that become increasingly complicated.If it sounds like a 'typical' movie of that sort, it is. Why? Because it was the prototype for all the rest of them to come. One can't really dock the movie for being the typical affair goes dead wrong movie, because it was the first one of its kind that truly perfected the formula. It'd be like saying Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew is WAAAAY too much like 10 Things I Hate About You. The thing is, Fatal Attraction really defied the expectations that I had set for it. The movie starts out kind of like Lyne began last year's Unfaithful - happy family together, and the parents getting ready to go out to a soiree. At that evening's party, Dan, while away from his wife, runs into Alex for the first time, and the sparks begin to fly. Now, the movie's title kind of gives away the fact that the woman is going to go completely nuts on him later, but James Dearden's screenplay, and Glenn Close's careful rendering of her character makes Alex a decent person to begin with. I was immediately impressed that Alex isn't some creepy, eccentric vixen that looks like bad news to begin with.The inevitable begins, and Dan's wife and child must go away for the weekend. Alex turns up at a meeting at Dan's law firm, and shortly thereafter the affair begins. Right before they engage in some of the most protracted and unintentionally funny sex in film history, Lyne gives us an exquisite little scene in a restaurant between Dan and Alex. This is one of the crucial scenes in the film, for it sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Unlike Unfaithful, the two don't spend an increasingly longer amount of time with each other and then hastily have sex. Their dialogue right before their first tryst is direct. Like consenting adults, they simply agree that they're going to do it. No dancing around his apartment to sexy jazz music, no braille cookbook seduction. They simply sign a verbal agreement and then go at it on the kitchen sink, complete with running water and Douglas's odd obsession with having Close's breast in his mouth. The rest of their weekend consists of sex, more sex, and even more sex, with the obligatory 'funny scene where they almost get caught doing it in public.' The movie really takes off on it's nail-biting, visceral course when Dan decides he must leave.The woman goes nuts, and that's an understatement. Calls and unexpected visits occur. Alex calls the house, but just stays silent when Dan's wife answers. Family pets are murdered. The tension mounts unbearably. The whole section of the film leading up to its exciting conclusion really makes an amazing impact. I had a huge list of expectations for what certain things would happen, but most of them didn't. This may be the prototypical erotic revenge thriller, but it certainly jumps over some of its own limitations. Anne Archer, Dan's wife, is an interestingly written character, for she is unsuspecting of it all until, well, until Dan must break down and confess. There is no bra discovered that isn't hers, no story that doesn't check out with someone else, no 'why have you been so distant since that one weekend when I left you completely alone?' All of the tension in the movie lies with what Alex will do next to remind Dan that he can't just let her go. The movie throws out another convention by actually letting Alex meet Dan and his wife in an incredibly uncomfortable scene where Alex slyly obtains their phone number after it has been changed. Fatal Attraction, along with its incredible building suspense, becomes less and less of the cookie-cutter genre film that it's been categorized as. This is in part thanks to amazing work by Close. As the movie's 'villain,' she radiates a dangerous sexuality and inital vulnerability that makes a great combination. Once she goes apes**t on Dan, she's simply a blast to watch. In that 'please let me never cross paths with a woman like her' sense, of course.I love Fatal Attraction for much of the same reason that I loved Unfaithful. Hidden carefully beneath the movie's thriller facade is actually an excellent morality fable. This is hinted at when Alex is introduced as a likeable, sympathetic character, but fully fleshed-out once Dan must go back to his family. Sure, the woman's a freak, but Dan was the one that had the affair with her, so he's somewhat responsible. He told her that things would have to end, but no affair can just be extinguished like that. When he nicely tells her that it can't continue, I actually kind of felt bad for Alex. Sex has an emotional attachment to it that Dan tried to put behind him, but Alex couldn't. There is a crucial plot twist introduced into the film nearly halfway through that I won't reveal here, but it adds most importantly to the whole idea of Dan's moral quandry. At times, I was torn. For a while, Alex is simply a fling that's hanging on and one actually feels sympathy for her somewhat. Sure, it's all dispelled by the end of the film, but for a while the movie really turns the preconceived notions of its characters upside-down. Dan is trying to get back to his family, but isn't he somewhat of a creep for screwing around in the first place? That's the rocky terrain of infidelity, and Lyne's film explores it with an underlying expertise that can be seen through all the knife-weilding and bunny-boiling.The movie has a handful of truly exciting, somewhat violent scenes that add an extra punch to its escalating progress. At one point, Dan breaks into Alex's apartment and has a violent encounter with her as he tells her to quit messing with his family. Alex enacts schemes of such raw cruelty, it's easy to understand why Dan is scared to death of her. Nothing compares to the movie's violent, bloody finale that has become a movie thriller landmark (one word, guys catfight). It's truly one of the most well-done and exciting action scenes in film, and it's a bravura closer to a movie that deserves nothing less. Sure, it may not do anything creative to tie up the ends of the movie, but I'm glad Lyne used such an explosive scene. On the Special Edition DVD, an alternate ending can be viewed, and I was disappointed - it may be more creative and mean more in the context of the film (and may be technically better), but I'll stick with punches, guns, and knives for my revenge flick finales any day. Fatal Attraction is and always will be one of the most exciting, nail-bitingly intense, and entertaining movies of all time. It got six Academy Award nominations in 1987, including nods to Glenn Close and Anne Archer AND Best Picture. That's a testament to how much of a phenomenon it was then, but the fact that it stands up so well even today says so much more.

There is a clever bit when Austin is talking to the head of a Japanese corporation and the subtitles are cut off by an object to make it look like something dirty is being said. That was particularly funny. The beginning is certainly inventive and very cool and funny.Mike Myers gave 2 performances in the first Austin Powers(Austin and Dr. Evil) and 3 performances in the second (Austin, Dr. Evil, and Fat Bastard). Myers is trying to outdo himself here by giving 4 performances by adding a new character called Goldmember. Alot of people said he was really pushing it when he added Fat Bastard in the second film but I thought Fat Bastard offered his share of laughs. However, Goldmember is a mockery of Dutch people that seems more offensive and irritating than funny. Besides Goldmember, I mostly enjoyed watching Myers.Beyonce Knowles is the new girl alongside Austin. Knowles is not bad but she is not as good as Hurley and Graham were. Michael Caine is fine as Austins Dad but the surprise ending when he reveals a shocker is lame.Despite some derivative comedy and a lame ending, Goldmember is worth watching. I dont know about an Austin 4 though. This series seems to be running out of ideas.

The phrase snuff films hadn't even been invented in 1960, nor did videotape cameras exist, so the movie was far in advance of its time. You might be disappointed if you looking for pure excitement, you have to be willing to examine deeper issues.Carl Bohm is perfect in the role of the killer, and his faint German accent (which might be interpreted as a. psychogenic speech defect) adds to the creepiness of his character. Instead of an over-the-top maniac (Jack Nicholson, are you listening?), he portrays a frightened and insecure little person who can only relate to the world by looking at it, preferably through a camera lens. It is easy to condemn him for his obsession with peeping, but -um- aren't we doing the same thing by watching this movie, or any movie? The most interesting movies are those that  provoke such questions in us. This aspect also helps explain why Peeping Tom was so fiercely condemned in 1960.(The scenes between Bohm and Massey remind me of those between Gustav Diesel and Louise Brooks in the last part of Pandora's Box (1928), and you can bet the Michael Powell was familiar with Pabst's work.)The idea that scrutiny = punishment was explored by Michel Foucault in his book Surveiller et Punir, which I happened to read a long time ago. We will be finding out more about  this as the National Security State draws closer. Anyway, here you have a powerless little guy who tries to feel the same sense of control by turning  his camera - literally - into a murder-weapon. The technical details of this contrivance seem unrealistic, but the symbolism is so powerful they scarcely matter.The hard-edged sound of late-50s cool jazz works very nicely in setting the atmosphere, similar to Town Without Pity (1960). Nowadays we tend to think of that era as idyllic, so its useful to remind ourselves of the dark edges that existed.
