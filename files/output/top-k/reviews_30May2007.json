[{"date":"30 May 2007","score":"","review":" The first time I saw this movie, I was only 9 or 10, and it kept me scared for about two years, even though I only saw about five minutes of it. The first time I saw it, I only saw the scene where Melissa Margaret Marr(Bridgette Wilson) (hot) is walking in the underground asylum videotaping, which I thought was very eerie, and I remember thinking that when it happened. The entire asylum just looked creepy and scared me. Then, to cap it off, she gets mutilated by something and a glimpse is caught on her camera. I also got to see her body parts hanging in the freezer, which FREAKED ME OUT!!!!!!! I just recently saw the entire thing about three weeks ago, which is odd because I remembered that scene for some reason and wanted to see the movie all the way through, and then it was on. Anywho, the movie. I think its good and scary. It really keeps you guessing the entire time. Is the house really haunted, or is it just the millionaire couple trying to scare each other? The movie has its own score and music that was composed for it, which add to the effect very nicely. The acting is very good, but it seems that you only get a little bit of screen time from each actor. The ghost doctor's movements is enough to scare anyone for life, and it still does scare me sometime's. I won't lie, the ending is sort of a let down. I was hoping that the ghosts would have bigger roles as the movie goes on, but Melissa is the only character to really have any paranormal encounters, and she dies right after having one. The plot is pretty simple to follow and the characters are all interesting, but I think we could have discovered more about their background. Eddie was a pro baseball player, but he isn't anymore. Melissa was on a game show, but she was cancelled. It would have been interesting to find out more about the characters, but that could easily get the movie off topic.All in all, I think that this is a good movie. It has good music, a good plot, and good acting. If you really like ghost movies or horror movies in general, you might like it.

Together, they form a multi-billionaire industry making terrific films which the audience and the critics love to watch. And this is one of them.Monsters Inc. has a very odd and different plot. Monsters scare children to provide electricity by collecting the children's screams but they are scared of the children themselves are they think that they would get contaminated by touching them. Sullivan is the best scarer of the company Monsters Inc. and he, together with his best friend Mike, work as the best employees in Monsters Inc. But then when Sullivan leaves the door to the children's room open by mistake, he invites an unwelcoming guest, a small, terribly cute girl called Boo. And then the world goes upside down.A team of monsters are in search of the girl while Mike and Sullivan try to rescue the girl by sending her back to the door where she came from.But then they come to know that their own boss is involved with their rival and they try to stop them from taking the child by putting in all their effort and strength.Now, after this summary, let me tell you some of the good points of the movie1) Excellent animation. Monsters are not shown scary and so it is a movie for all. Even the young toddlers would fall in love with the monsters.2) Boo is too cute and I fell in love with her the moment I saw her. She was not shown too stupid and so her role fitted well in the movie.3) Sullivan's voicing was great and I felt touched when he fought for Boo.4) The yeti was really funny in the short role he had got. It was good to see that they showed Himalayas and didn't stick to one place only.5) Mike was really funny and his voicing was almost perfect.6) The plot is very different and not the same monotonous type.Now, there were some bad points in the movie1) Celia's voicing was done badly. Her voice could have been better.2) I found it stupid when they showed that Sullivan's boss wanted to kidnap all children and this was his motive. It was very stupid to show that this was the reason that he was bad.3) Roz's voice made me almost doze off. Please speak a bit louder and clearer next time, grandma.4) Mike got a bit annoying when he got angry at his friend Sullivan. He did not really look angry and his voice was more of a nagging type than an angry one.Overall, this movie was great but not as good as Shrek Still it deserves an 8 out of 10.

I would describe watching this movie being similar to going to an art museum and studying original van goghs. Not exciting, but still beautiful none the less. I watched this movie when I was really tired and missed a lot so I decided to watch it again. But because it is really unentertaining it took me a while before I could bring myself to put it in my DVD player. But when I did it was one of the most rewarding movie experiences I have had in a while. The only reason I did not give it a 10 because it was not that entertaining and the scenes with the people whipping themselves lost some of its power (because I have grown up so accustomed to violence in movies). So let's try to start from just the substance of the movie. To even tackle such a hard subject with a movie was extremely bold, but the duologue was so good it almost felt as if I was reading it out of a philosophy book. The desperation of not knowing really pushed this movie forward and it was interesting to see how each of the characters dealt with death and not knowing the end. The fact that death did not know was brilliant and on every level in term of substance it was perfect. There were also some really good shots. The shot where Jon approaches the camera in the empty village was very well done and with live animals very nicely done. Actually one of my favorite shots was a simple one of the Joseph and Mia with the baby and the way the camera above them with Joseph in the front left and Mia in the back right on the tree branch. Not to sound like an ass but the shot felt very organic. I actually loved how he did death here and how he had a sense of humor and loved a challenge making him human. The confidence he exudes was perfect and when he says that he does not know the answer it almost feels as if it is because there is no answer. I like how he used a lot of black in shots of peoples faces. It was really well done and gave that sense of emptiness. My favorite point where that was done is the scene in the church with Death and Block. This is also my favorite scene and I feel as if one of the best scenes I have ever seen. The set up where it feels as if death is in a prison cell to see that Block in indeed the prisoner. The shot of him through the bars where you cannot see the back ground was perfect. I loved all the acting and even it was silly at points (by our standards) it was supposed to be. Even the one guys death scene was meant to be that way. It is interesting that I believe that Joseph and Mia were supposed to die, but Block was able to trick Death, but Death did not know he was tricked. So death can go one thinking he is perfect and has never been beaten. Such a great movie and I could go on and on about it, but I am tired of writing this.

The addition of a disability and the doctor's verve in introducing a New Way into a stagnant school is really no more than salad dressing -- by avoiding the real situation, Marlee Matlin's disability, and having William Hurt verbalize her emotions and her needs, we get only a fifty per cent of the picture and the story loses all of its punch. A much different picture, BABEL, presented a girl, Chieko, who was also a deaf-mute and needed to connect with Someone. With limited screen time, her story was the most memorable of the quartet, her lone cry as she let loose her pent-up feelings in front of a young detective who seemed to understand her loneliness as he recoiled in horror at the fact that she was a girl, plain and simple, and he couldn't take advantage of her, was something that has haunted me since. In CHILDREN OF A LESSER GOD, Matlin also screams in rage, but by then, her emotions, her language -- everything about her -- has been spelled out to the public by Hurt's condescending manner that it muddles her own suffering. Yes, she goes through a lot; yes, she's so bottled up in her own baggage that any letting go, any real trust, becomes a litmus test. I think that the main problem with this badly titled movie is the time when it was made. Had it been done today, with today's production values, it would have been a much more rewarding experience, and the love story, as nearly impossible and daunting, would have really resonated. However, it's an okay movie that even with the large amount of faults within its fabric, should be seen.

It should be a year of celebration, pride and solidarity. However, the atmosphere of this masterpiece from young Martin Scorsese (he was 33 at the film's release) inspires the very opposite. Taxi Driver wants to be depressing et pessimistic and its vision of America, especially of its supreme city, is everything but happy.The story of Taxi Driver is about Travis Bickle, a young insomniac ex-Marine who takes a job as a taxi driver. He tours the streets of New York City, which are continually populated with prostitutes, pimps and 'Negros' from Harlem with the jazzy music of the pleasant Bernard Herrmann soundtrack. Travis' only wish is that someday a real rain come and wash the scum off the streets.It's Robert De Niro who plays Travis and he lives in his character like in a second skin. When we see him in the beginning, he seems to be absolutely normal and he looks like all of those innocent characters whose only desire is to have a good worthwhile job, even if it should be tiresome or boring. However, we can quickly perceive that he's the only person of his kind and he's also about to blow off.Desperate to connect with others, Travis invites Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), a pretty young woman who works for the electoral committee of Senator Palantine (do not confuse with the emperor Palpatine, even if the spelling looks alike), for a date. Travis, however, makes a gross mistake when he brings her to a porno movie, the only hobby that Travis knows.After buying a rather unreasonable number of firearms from a black market vendor, Travis' mental state quickly deteriorates and he becomes addicted to violence with the miniature army that he bought and his days in Vietnam don't help him.

We can assist to the deterioration of his mental state and we feel that he could crack at any moment. In the end, with good thinking, the violence that he shows is shocking and terrifying, but it's not that surprising.It's definitely a worrying look, not only upon New York, but also America in its entirety. New York is not the only city in the United States and its problems are not unique to it. Taxi Driver is the story of an idealist who wanted to change the world and make it better. And he decided to do it without caring too much about the means.The movie's ending is ultra-violent, but the bad guys are dead anyway. Is it a happy ending anyway? I think it's the choice of the viewer. Everything depends on how the viewer takes on Scorsese's vision. If the viewer decides that it's a happy ending, it means that he\/she is optimistic and believes that it is possible for us to change the world in a good and significant way. If the viewer believes that it's a sad ending, then he\/she is pessimistic and doesn't believe that we can really free ourselves from the mess that is American society.In the end, it can summarized this way if you think it's a happy ending, you're like Travis Bickle. If you don't, you rather are like Martin Scorsese.Taxi Driver won the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Festival in 1976. It's a fully deserved honor, because it's a really revolutionary film. I wonder that if it didn't win the Oscar for Best Movie (an honor that rather went to Rocky), it's only because it was too hard for the jury's taste who wasn't ready to accept the reality or who refuted Scorsese's ideology shown in the movie.

Needless to say, I was disappointed by the film.I expected to see an adolescent cool-cat Anakin step up and turn bad. Instead, I got a terrible child actor trying to save his mother and not even bearing a hint of his imminent future. I expected immense and glorious space battles, but instead got a particularly boring scene in which the above-mentioned child takes on a fleet of comically ridiculous droid fighters. I was expecting to see storm troopers marching around in some form, but all i got was some dorky droids.Iwasn't happy about the film.However, now that I have viewed the entire new trilogy, the film makes more sense, though not much. It seems to lack any real plot developments in the long run, unlike Episodes Two and Three. Still, the film is visually competent, and it is nice to see the first modern interpretation of the Star Wars galaxy since the early 1980s. There's also another factor that bumped my score up from a 4 or 5 to a 6.

His scenes are the high points of the film. They are fast-paced, fun, and truly suspenseful. More importantly, they take us away from Jake Lloyd and Natalie Portman, who give awful performances.

This, even with the ending credits actually being one of this movie's best parts. It featured the cast of the movie lipsynching and dancing to the song Hey Mickey. Bring it On could be a real pain in some points. The combined crudeness and general long length it seemed to take for the movie to reach its climax made it a bit difficult to watch.The movie finally gets a move on it, when Torrance, shortly after becoming squad captain, discovers that the former Torros captain had been stealing the cheerleading routines of a squad from another school- the Clovers. Torrance then, overcome with guilt and shame, takes it upon herself to create a fresh routine for the team before the finals that are only a few weeks away. Torrance attributes much of her problems to the curse. The Curse was the hilarious myth that Torrance picked up at cheer camp, that claimed that dropping the spirit stick caused bad fortune to follow you for the rest of your life.The movie definitely has its quite humorous moments. The more shallow characters are clearly parodies- in fact, most of the film is indeed a parody. The movie in some ways teaches a lesson by mocking those who are proud of themselves for cheating to win.My favorite characters were as follows- Torrance Shipman, (Kirsten Dunst) president of the Torros squad; Missy Pantone (Eliza Dushku), Torrance's closest friend and ally on the squad; Cliff Pantone (Jesse Bradford), Missy's electric-guitar-playing, constantly-CD-player-wearing, cheerleader-hating brother and Torrance's romantic fixation throughout the greater part of the film.

Carrie Fisher, the actress who played Princess Leia, channeled hers into a novel that became another winning Mike Nichols domestic comedy, Postcards From The Edge.Meryl Streep stars as Carrie alter-ego Suzanne Vale, a once-successful actress trying to restart her career after a near-fatal O.D. Her mother, a screen legend in her day named Doris Mann (Shirley MacLaine), happily takes on the responsibility of overseeing Suzanne's recovery, especially given the attendant oversight she gets on daughter's life and career.I really hate that you have to go through this, Doris sighs upon visiting her daughter in the rehab clinic. I wish I could go through this for you. MacLaine gives, frame for frame, the best performance in the film, one of her best ever. She and Streep seem to feed off the best aspects of each other's prior screen work, Streep picking up on MacLaine's sass and comedic chops, MacLaine on the way Streep can give you a sea of sadness through just a flickering gleam in her eyes.Streep's comedy turn is the big surprise here, especially given how successfully she pulls it off. No dingoes running off with babies in this production. Nichols helps by putting her in situations that are very un-Streepish, like being threatened by cheesy Scarface extras or inhaling Fritos. Whatever the props, Meryl herself makes me laugh, something I never expected. Not that she lays back. Her gift for inhabiting others' skin is on fine display, as she gives Suzanne Carrie Fisher's wry intonations and wan half-laugh.You can hear the connection on the DVD commentary; a candid, amusing piece by Fisher in which she explains the background of Postcards, why she considers it emotionally autobiographical in the way it deals with her own past drug issues and especially her relationship with her movie-star mother, Debbie Reynolds. At the same time, it's fictional in many key details.Fisher's clever Hollywood-dream-factory send-up of a script gives MacLaine and Streep plenty of great lines that pop off the screen like cherry bombs. Instant gratification takes too long, Suzanne whines.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"30 May 2007","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" One of the ways that Gone with the Wind succeeds and transcends its genre as a romantic period picture is its unwillingness to stick with convention. The relationship between Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara is never stereotypical or predictable. At first, the love triangle between Scarlett, Melanie and Ashley Wilkes seems cliché, like a soap opera decades before The Young and the Restless, until Clark Gable as Butler literally steps into the picture and messes up the melodrama. One of the best scenes occurs when Scarlett professes her love to Ashley in private at a large social gathering and unbeknown-st to the characters, Rhett Butler is hiding behind a couch watching the drama unfold. When he finally reveals himself to her, the scene moves into new and unchartered territory, and we learn that neither Scarlett nor Butler are stereotypical characters. As the film progresses, Scarlett continually rejects Butler, which was probably quite unusual for audiences of the time who were probably more akin to melodramatic instantaneous romance.In the background is the sweeping story of the Civil War. In essence, the story is about the coming-of-age of Scarlett O'Hara, which was unusual at the time. Coming-of-age stories have (and still do) typically center around male and not female characters. She is at first the manipulative sex goddess who uses her looks and charisma to get the men in her life to serve her on hand and foot, even those dating other women. When Butler comes into her life, he is the first male not to be so hypnotized by her; he is willing to stand up to her and call her bluff. How the relationship between Butler and Scarlett unfolds is one of the great cinematic stories and not to be missed.Unfortunately, the movie suffers from rather serious shortcomings in its portrayal of African-Americans, particularly the character of Prissie. What makes this aspect of the film so infuriating is that these scenes do nothing to further the plot and have very little to with the central story, particularly the relationship between Scarlett and Rhett. African-Americans are characterized as either being witless, like Prissie, or loyal to the South which is completely unrealistic. Only the character of Mammy appears like her own character and at least is more rounded than her African-American counterparts in the film. The scenes with Prissie, which seem ad infinitum in the first half, are probably the worst of the film. Ironically, Hattie McDaniel who played Mammy was the first African-American to win an academy award. At least the second half is not as bad as the first half in this regard. The portrayal of Prissie and some of the other African-Americans tell us more about America's view of African-Americans in the 1930's than showing us a realistic picture of African-Americans during the time of the Civil War.

The story of Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara is one of the best love stories ever told on the large screen. Is it a masterpiece?

","genre":null},{"date":"30 May 2007","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" One of the ways that Gone with the Wind succeeds and transcends its genre as a romantic period picture is its unwillingness to stick with convention. The relationship between Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara is never stereotypical or predictable. At first, the love triangle between Scarlett, Melanie and Ashley Wilkes seems cliché, like a soap opera decades before The Young and the Restless, until Clark Gable as Butler literally steps into the picture and messes up the melodrama. One of the best scenes occurs when Scarlett professes her love to Ashley in private at a large social gathering and unbeknown-st to the characters, Rhett Butler is hiding behind a couch watching the drama unfold. When he finally reveals himself to her, the scene moves into new and unchartered territory, and we learn that neither Scarlett nor Butler are stereotypical characters. As the film progresses, Scarlett continually rejects Butler, which was probably quite unusual for audiences of the time who were probably more akin to melodramatic instantaneous romance.In the background is the sweeping story of the Civil War. In essence, the story is about the coming-of-age of Scarlett O'Hara, which was unusual at the time. Coming-of-age stories have (and still do) typically center around male and not female characters. She is at first the manipulative sex goddess who uses her looks and charisma to get the men in her life to serve her on hand and foot, even those dating other women. When Butler comes into her life, he is the first male not to be so hypnotized by her; he is willing to stand up to her and call her bluff. How the relationship between Butler and Scarlett unfolds is one of the great cinematic stories and not to be missed.Unfortunately, the movie suffers from rather serious shortcomings in its portrayal of African-Americans, particularly the character of Prissie. What makes this aspect of the film so infuriating is that these scenes do nothing to further the plot and have very little to with the central story, particularly the relationship between Scarlett and Rhett. African-Americans are characterized as either being witless, like Prissie, or loyal to the South which is completely unrealistic. Only the character of Mammy appears like her own character and at least is more rounded than her African-American counterparts in the film. The scenes with Prissie, which seem ad infinitum in the first half, are probably the worst of the film. Ironically, Hattie McDaniel who played Mammy was the first African-American to win an academy award. At least the second half is not as bad as the first half in this regard.
