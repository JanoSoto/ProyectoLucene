Of course, back in 1948, they had a different idea of what 'thrilling' and 'suspenseful' were than we do today. The film was loosely based on two young men from the University of Chicago and the actual murder they committed.  Perhaps the reason why Hitchcock experimented with the long takes was to depict the story as being more realistic.  The two men in this film killed only so they could see what it was like and to experience the exhilaration of taking a life.  Hopefully this wasn't the reason for the actual murder case! You don't really realize that the movie is filmed in entirely one long shot until you think about it.  I think this technique was well executed and did create some sense of suspense.  The viewer almost feels as if they are there attending the party with the smooth camera movements and the sense of real time.  The transitions that took place when the film reels were changed were kind of cheesy, but not that noticeable.  It was quite clever actually. Some people claim that towards the end of the film, the camera actually does cut to a different shot.  I guess the only way to find out whether or not this is true is to watch the film over again in extreme detail.  The fact that the story takes place in only one room and over the course of one evening is quite out of the ordinary.  The entire movie is about a dinner party.  It sounds pretty boring at first, but the twist is that the guest of honor, in which everyone is readily expecting, is actually dead inside a chest where the dinner is being served from.  This whole idea is creepy in itself.  The guests constantly wonder where he is and eventually leave the party, never knowing the he was actually there the entire time.There were some scenes where the guests came a little too close to discovering the dead body.  These scenes were a little nerve-racking because if the body was discovered, their whole plan would come to a halt.  I really enjoy when a film gets the audience involved, but that was expected here since almost all Hitchcock films do!

Along with The Thing, Day the Earth Stood Still, War of the Worlds, Creature from the Black Lagoon, Them!, Forbidden Planet, The Incredible Shrinking Man, Village of the Damned, and a few others, this film helped to raise the standards for movie science fiction.Besides an excellent story, Ellsworth Fredericks' camera work is practically a course in cinematography. You don't really notice it--you're not supposed to--but Fredericks' attention to the rules of continuity and photographic composition are in part why this movie flows so well. Also, the many night scenes were shot at night, during an era where a lot of night movie scenes were just underexposed day shots, adding a realism to the mystery and scariness of the movie.The other pluses Great direction building from an almost Mayberry-like feel at the beginning (after the prologue) to more and more tension as the story develops the mystery. The screenplay is extraordinary in that is sounds like it was written for adults, rather than the 12-year old typical sci-fi fare of the time, although only a hint of the suggestive adult dialog remains from the original screenplay. In one scene, Becky asks Miles, Is this an example of your bedside manner? No, that comes later.Style. Arguably, this is a crossover film between Film Noir and Science Fiction\/Horror. The hero is well meaning but powerless to control his circumstances. And look at the posters behind the pool table in the Belicec's house.Casting. Almost perfect. Kevin McCarthy plays every scene like he doesn't know what is coming next. The others are excellent as well. Only change I might have made...Donna Reed was considered for the part of Becky Driscoll.

Watching this from time to time, it is also a kind of movie time capsule portraying the 50's just as I remember the time. I know I've watched this movie 25 times, and every time I see something else about the cinematography and the setting.Finally, I've read and heard for years of the original version without the prologue, epilogue, and narration.

The kicker is it really seems like a live action version of the old classic black and white Popeye cartoons, right down to the spinning pipe.Im 30, grew up in Georgia, and have seen many of the old Popeye cartoons. These cartoons didnt make much sense, but they were very predictable. Their charm was in the little things.  Things like Popeyes constant punny comments, the confusingly random splice of ludicrous characters, and the overblown fighting gags.I remember a Popeye cartoon where Popeye has to walk Olives little dog. He reluctantly agrees (sap!) and he and sissy dog meet up with Bluto walking his big bull dog.  Harassment ensues, Popeye says Me pekinese is week in de knees, they both eat spinach, and in a barrage of whimsical yet freakishly brutal retaliation, Popeye and pekinese triumph.These cartoons werent really my favorite, but seeing them put to live action with intricate detail is a trip.  In creating the world Popeye lives in, there is a necessarily huge amount of artistic license, but the sets are so cool and colorful, it almost seems like another planet.  The movie is basically an introduction to the whole Popeye saga.  The central cast of characters are all well cast and faithfully portrayed and the rib jabbingly obtuse humor is playfully retained.One thing you must brace yourself for is that this is a musical. Critically lambasted after release in 1980, it was called boring, cluttered, and a lot of attention was called to the songs as being ill-conceived and vapid. But there is a quaint lowbrow feel to the songs, as the lyrics are intentionally simple and repetitive.  Personally I like the music, its catchy in its noticeably unsophisticated originality that seems to fit with the vintage, salty world of Popeye.I saw this movie in the theater as a kid, and Im not sure if I would recommend it as a kids movie.  But seeing it again as an adult in a slightly altered state, I found it a rush of memories and laughs.  If you plan to see this movie and remember the cartoon, think of the old show first, and be amazed as it almost comes to life.  It cant actually do that, but they give it a frighteningly good shot.Favorite Popeye line Anudda ting I got, is a senkse of humiligration.I give it 8\/10.

There were lots of problems with the films violence and dark tone, many people felt that a film which kids love should not involve these subjects.

I can't fully explain how it happened or where it started but a powder keg eventually exploded and many same-sex oriented parts were to be found.  I theorize that Chasing Amy had something to do with that revolution but if it didn't help spark it, it sure helped it along. Off that tangent, I found Chasing Amy to be the most unexpectedly deep film to come from such an oddball director.  It was such films as Dogma and Clerks that turned me into a die-hard Kevin Smith fan but his probably the film that he toiled the most on was Chasing Amy. Something told me that this was much more than your regular romantic comedy. To date, I haven't seen a film about romantic relationships and dating this deep and complex with the exception of The Tao Of Steve.Here are my reasons (spoilers contained within) (1) I will forever be a Kevin Smith fan regardless how bad or how good his work will be from on. I leave the reader to decide if that is a stupid reason or not. (2) Of all movies I have seen, this is the best comedy of errors that I have ever seen. The scenes at the bar where Holden finds out where Alyssa is a lesbian is a perfect example. (3) Ben Affleck and Jason Lee showed their chops before they were really famous.  Ben Affleck was good as the supposedly hindered leading man (how can he be hindered if he draws comic book characters that use weed to become superheroes?).  Jason Lee was excellent as the angry best friend (and I don't think he is sexually repressed either). (4) The dialogue regardless of lacking of depth one might think it is, it is written sharply and cleanly. I believe that took some time and toil on Smith's part to perfect. (5) The first fight scene between Holden and Banky was phenomenal. I like the part where Banky draws the four-way road to prove a point. (6) Like all Kevin Smith movies, it is loaded with quotes and lines that are quoteworthy. (7) As much as I like Jay and Silent Bob, the scarcity of them was refreshing. (8) Lunchbox (Silent Bob) also got to talk (GASP!)at length about his misfortunes in love. (9) This film shatters the conception that an odd plot with odd characters in an odd setting (the world of comics) cannot ever give a fulfilling movie experience. (10) A lot of shots are taken at popular culture of the time.  Chasing Amy is a time capsule for the late nineties.  Ten reasons give a score of 10!Overall, this is a triumphant tale of love, loss, missed signals, mixed emotions, errors and comic books.

Tolkien. Over four years ago director Peter Jackson decided he was going to make it into a film and got to work with the most amazing cast and crew imaginable. In December of 2001 the first part of this trilogy appeared The Fellowship of the Ring. In Fellowship we are introduced to Frodo Baggins--an adolescent Hobbit with an eye for knowledge and adventure. His Uncle is Bilbo Baggins, who went on an adventure before Frodo's time and found on that adventure--in the cave of the creature Gollum--a magical ring which turns its wearer invisible. Upon Bilbo's leaving the Shire (the home of the Hobbit-folk) Frodo inherits the ring and learns from the wise wizard, Gandalf the Grey, that the heirloom is in fact the One Ring, forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom. Gandalf explains that the Ring can only be destroyed in those fires, which rest in the heart of Mordor--the Dark Lord's land of shadow. Frodo bravely accepts the challenge of taking the Ring as far as Rivendell, the safe-haven of the Elves. It is there that Frodo offers to take the Ring to Mordor. The Fellowship is chosen and they set out to complete their task. The story centers around these nine characters and their quests, which in this story are all combined into one quest. The story starts out a little slowly, but when it takes off it goes pretty fast, with the exception of a couple more slow spots. What I have observed from this classic has been completely good. I have not been able to find anything wrong with it, maybe except for the fact that it's really long and when you see it in the theaters and have to go to the bathroom right in the middle! ^^ Seriously, though, I have four reasons why you should see this movie. 1 - The good guys are lovable. In scenes like the Moria conversation between Frodo and Gandalf, or the battle with the Watcher in the Water, you find yourself cheering on their bravery or listening with awe to the sorrows they are going through. You bond with the characters; you feel as though you're on the journey, fighting alongside them. 2 - The bad guys are pure evil. By that I mean, in this movie you are cheering for the bad guys to get totally maimed. There is one fight in which some audiences actually clap when a certain bad guy is killed! I love how it is plain that evil is evil and good is good. It's not like in some movies where you're sad that the bad guy dies because you kind of liked them...or where you're confused because a bad guy seems bad, but then is good and stuff like that. 3 - The quest is legendary. Probably one of the most attracting things about LOTR is the fact that it is a quest to save the world. That sort of thing never seems to get old. It is the sort of tale that has been retold through time. We just love to see a hero--much like us, or not at all--fighting boldly for what he believes...striving to reach something and finally attaining his goal. Perhaps it is because we, like Frodo, have quests of our own to complete. Whatever the reason, we love the quest. 4 - The values are Christian. The Lord of the Rings is most rare because it has morals. There's no sex, no drugs, no obscene language...it's wholesome and clean. Some Christians would argue and say, Oh, but there's magic! And wizards! So what? It's a story, a fable, a tale, a myth, a yarn...anything else I can say to emphasize that? Oh yeah; it's not real! Harry Potter takes place in a world that we can get to from our world, LOTR takes place in a world that almost seems to have existed in the past, but obviously didn't. Frodo is a brave lad striving to save the world. Like a real person he loses hope and even we lose faith in him. But he seems to be carried on by a stronger power...

Modern society has become so politically correct and desensitized to controversial issues that we're less tolerant and understanding of the original intent of a film such as this, especially when it's messages are not consistent with our modern value system. Thus, some of the obvious stereotypes presented in this film (such as the pigs portraying cops and the crows portraying blacks, for example), could never be presented in a film today. Granted, these images were meant to be offensive in the 70's as well, but they were obviously taken in a different light back then, as they were indicative of a specific brand of biting satire found in the 70's and hippie culture and a reflection of how that particular generation could openly address such social issues. These issues, such as racism, are clearly still relevant today, we just address them in a different manner, which is why Fritz the Cat still has potency yet is more or less looked upon as a curious time capsule of a bygone era today.

The whole thing is so mind-bogglingly stupid, all you can do is sit there in stunned disbelief. Paul Kersey, the put-upon protagonist, demonstrates once again what a jinx he is. Having seen his immediate family (and his maid) wiped out in the first two films, he returns to New York City - or, at least, a little-seen area of London mocked up as a hellish inner-city district of the Big Apple - and not only does his old army buddy (fresh from a beating by Bill from BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE) die in his arms, he's also arrested by the local cops on suspicion of killing him. This is a run of bad luck that would even test the patience of Tex Avery's Droopy. Kersey is taken down to the station where he gets roughed up and locked in a communal cell with some hardcore thugs, none of whom are a match for the 65-year-old vigilante. After a quick bit of chatter about the rising crime rates, the Chief decides to spring Kersey (I'm a real fan, he explains helpfully) to do his dirty work for him. And all this happens in the first fifteen minutes! This is a film that doesn't so much stretch credibility as forget about it completely. Kersey returns to the besieged apartment block and finds out first-hand what a hellhole it is. The residents live in fear of thieves, vandals, muggers, robbers and all kinds of human scum under the loose command of a Willem Dafoe lookalike with a kind of reverse mohican, so our erstwhile hero gets to work, setting boobytraps, punching out speed-addled goons and blowing the creeps away. This plods on for about an hour, but Kersey is doing his job too well, stealing the police force's thunder, so he gets locked up again. This lasts about as long as it takes to have a shave, and the scene is set for a pulverising twenty minutes of cartoon carnage with a sky-high body count and some genuinely hilarious deaths, none moreso than the demise of the gang leader. And, this being a Winner film, there is one (unseen) rape and one attempted rape, but thankfully the focus is on pyrotechnic violence, of which there is plenty. It's all entertaining, in a cheesy, no-brainer kind of way, the production values are cheap and cheerful, the script is atrocious and there are more laughs here than in several comedies I could mention. If this film wasn't made under the influence of a blizzard of cocaine, then I fear Winner and company have the shakiest grip on reality this side of Howard Hughes.

After getting two of his fingers chopped off by the mob over $13,000 he owed them, he treks out West to get it.  On his way back through Arizona, his car breaks down.  This brings him to a town called Superior, where everyone seems to be out of their mind. After trying to put the moves on a young married woman (Jennifer Lopez), her older husband (Nick Nolte) tries to hire Bobby to kill her.  She, however, makes an even better counter offer to kill her husband instead.  When Bobby gets robbed at a convenience store, and doesn't even have the money to get his car out of the shop, he knows he has to think fast, because the mob will be after him soon.I normally don't like Oliver Stone.  I won't go into why, I think most people who aren't fond of his work can say it better than I can.  However, I thought this was such a great movie, but I knew it would be doomed at the box office.  It's probably too weird for most people to get into.Stone's direction is great.  He intercuts scenes from Bobby's point of view with quick flashes of images, and unlike the flashes of Brad Pitt in Fight Club or the flash of Guy Pearce in Memento, these ones last long enough to see and take in.  For example, before Bobby first meets Lopez's character, who was behind him down the street at the time, we see for a split second an image of her walking out from the alleyway with her package, sending Bobby a quick smile.  He then turns around to see her walking away.When she recalls how Nolte was married to her mother and beating her, we see a quick non-explicit shot of Nolte having sex with her mother from behind. She turns around and laughs, and Nolte swiftly decks her in the face, knocking her head back.  Not long enough to take attention away from the story, but long enough to be disturbing.Another disturbing shot, again with Lopez, is when Nolte is having sex with her.  The scene quickly alternates between different close up shots slightly off from what they intend to show; Lopez's hair, Nolte's arm, Lopez's foot, and that disturbing pet crow of Nolte's that won't shut up.The acting is wonderful.  Sean Penn makes a guy who is honestly beleagured despite being a generally immoral person.  He is not malicious, but is self-centered.  Nolte shocked me with how well he played such a sick b***ard, and Jon Voight (I know that's spelled wrong) and Billy Bob Thornton were unrecognizable in their respective roles as a blind Indian and a dirty mechanic.  Jennifer Lopez was also perfect for the part of the manipulative, possibly bi-polar woman who will do anything to get out of that worthless town, and Joaquin Pheonix was just hilarious.  In fact, this small performance was probably his best.Overall, quite a good movie.

For example, before Bobby first meets Lopez's character, who was behind him down the street at the time, we see for a split second an image of her walking out from the alleyway with her package, sending Bobby a quick smile.  He then turns around to see her walking away.When she recalls how Nolte was married to her mother and beating her, we see a quick non-explicit shot of Nolte having sex with her mother from behind. She turns around and laughs, and Nolte swiftly decks her in the face, knocking her head back.  Not long enough to take attention away from the story, but long enough to be disturbing.Another disturbing shot, again with Lopez, is when Nolte is having sex with her.  The scene quickly alternates between different close up shots slightly off from what they intend to show; Lopez's hair, Nolte's arm, Lopez's foot, and that disturbing pet crow of Nolte's that won't shut up.The acting is wonderful.  Sean Penn makes a guy who is honestly beleagured despite being a generally immoral person.  He is not malicious, but is self-centered.  Nolte shocked me with how well he played such a sick b***ard, and Jon Voight (I know that's spelled wrong) and Billy Bob Thornton were unrecognizable in their respective roles as a blind Indian and a dirty mechanic.  Jennifer Lopez was also perfect for the part of the manipulative, possibly bi-polar woman who will do anything to get out of that worthless town, and Joaquin Pheonix was just hilarious.  In fact, this small performance was probably his best.Overall, quite a good movie.

The acting is first rate considering that everyone is playing stock characters and the storytelling is very sharp even though you know where it's all going.  The second the safe-cracker starts fretting about his baby kid during a meeting discussing the job, you know he's gonna be the first to get it - though it's still a bit of a sad surprise when he does and his death sets up one of the best jokes in the film.As befits a noir, everyone is tainted in this film.  The hero is a petty crook who's a cheap and convenient hire for gang of more ambitious thieves, `financed' by a spineless lawyer who is planning to double cross them.  But Huston invests each of them with some level of honesty and vulnerability that eventually catches up with them.  By contrast, the Police Commissioner is never given a moment of kindness for us to relate to.  Instead he gives a gives a truly bizarre speech where he shows reporters that people to him are a squawking gibberish of numbers that come out of box when he flips a switch.  Compared to that (or the spectacle of his cruel, self-righteous satisfaction arresting Emmerich and intimidating his mistress) even the sordid shootout over the briefcase seems like a deeply touching human drama, esp. when Dix cries out `Are you a man, or what? Trying to gyp and double-cross with no guts for it. What's inside of you? What's keeping you alive?'  Latter in the film, a country doctor with the same near-mechanical manner as the Commissioner matter-of-factly notes that Dix hasn't got enough blood in him to keep a chicken alive.  Like the Commissioner's earlier claim that Dix is a person `without human feeling or mercy,' it's obvious that the doctor's words reflect more on himself than Dix.  One could go on about all the great scenes in this film, but the whole thing is so well put together.  The acting is fantastic, the photography is exquisitely ominous, the pacing and direction of the story are very tight.  Not sure if I prefer Asphalt Jungle to Melville's work or Dassin's `Riffifi.'  Might have to see it a few more times.  (It definitely makes Mann's `Heat' look too sentimental and high gloss to be sincere.)
