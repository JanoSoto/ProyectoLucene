The penguin never speaks and he hardly does anything but it's this same subtlety that makes him such an evil sinister- and therefore at the same time also hilarious and amusing villain. I don't know what it is about penguins but they always work out as such superb and amusing characters in animated movies.The story is however of course far from likely. I mean, how did the penguin even knew Wallace had mechanical trousers that he could use for his heist. And why at all would you use the tall and sluggish, sleeping Wallace to do a robbery for you. It's just too risky and doesn't really sound like the right suiting master-plan for the criminal genius the penguin is.But oh well, this of course doesn't make this Oscar-winning short animated movie any less fun to watch. In this modern day and age of technology claymation doesn't seem like the best weapon of choice to deliver a good, entertaining and convincing looking movie with. However with Wallace & Gromit, Aardman Animations have never failed at it to bring a good, entertaining and convincing looking movie. It's pretty amazing what you can do with just some simple pieces of clay. Characters are given a real personalities and sequences are looking very well done and detailed, as if it comes straight from a multi-million dollar budget movie.Wallace & Gromit however are not part of multi-million dollar budget productions. It's always kept small and simple and that's the charm of it. It's all kept simple, yet it's done in an incredibly professional way. This is also always a part of the movie its comedy. The movie features many crazy and also unlikely situations, that are being shot in such an incredible serious way that they tend to become hilarious.

And I guess it probably is okay, though it feels kind of wrong to say it. Because AMITYVILLE DOLLHOUSE seems as good an example as many, to show why horror was going the wrong way during the 90's It's just too unimaginative, formulaic and generic. It basically fails to impress.We got a new family moving into a new house (Starr Andreeff might actually be a reason for some to watch this -- I myself was kind of pleased that at least she was in it). Daddy finds a dollhouse in the backyard shack and gives it to his daughter -- and since we've seen all the previous Amityville-installments, we can only guess that the toy house is a vessel inhabited by the Amityville-evil. And the evil manifests itself in many ways (at least there's some variety in these matters), which soon becomes too routinely. Best one of these manifestations is probably a dead & rotten ghost-daddy coming back from the grave, playing his evil tricks. There's a somewhat interesting subplot about the history of the house, once destroyed in a fire, but not much is done with it.It's basically family-stuff going on in some scenes (presumably to give the characters some depth), mixed with supernatural happenings on which you can set a timer (that's how routinely it all plays out). And by the time the climax comes around - featuring a dimensional-portal through a fireplace, two pitchfork-wielding demons (doing nothing more than just that) and some master-devil-dude-puppet with wings that don't fly - it's just too little, too late.AMITYVILLE DOLLHOUSE might be pleasing for undemanding horror fans growing up in the 90's, and it's far from the worst horror movie you'll ever see. But it doesn't hold a candle to most other sequels from other franchises being cranked out at the time (and even before its straight-to-video release).

Not in the least. What I got was unlikable characters, unused potential and almost no ****ing Aliens for the past 90 minutes. I decided to use the site features to my advantage and took a look to see who wrote this God awful story and to see that it was written by a Joss Whedon. ...wait didn't he make that popular series with vampires in it? ... I'm probably think of someone else. Now the directing by Pierre was good as always, acting was good as well. He did great, it's just the story that falls to bloody acid pieces. Aliens 3 was just passable in some story aspects making a good conclusion to a movie series with Ripley killing herself along with the Alien inside her in a pit of lava...however it seems that she was to likable of a character to die, so they brought her back through some weird excuse such as cloning her. How original. But wait, Ripley's also an Alien\/Human Hybrid now...yay? Well, it's kinda pointless since see never seems to use her abilities that often, only seeming to use her acid like blood twice and not much else...waste of potential. I was wanting her to have a fist fight with an Alien the whole damn movie considering she doesn't even carry a weapon the whole bloody movie.Then we get introduced to some space pirates with of course half of them being unlikable so that we won't care as much once they die. Then the Aliens escape from their cells and all hell breaks loose. Now I know there should be only around 50 Aliens or so but really we don't see many Alien encounters in the movie.

That was until Newborn showed up. The apparent 'son' of Ripley. Now the design for this character is absolutely stupid. Especially since it somehow gets into the ship before Ripley with it's stubby legs.

However, this is all based upon Hollywood perspective, as I am yet to see even a single film where anyone acts like a real person to even a mild degree. For these standards, the film's performances are exceptional.You really buy into it being a small southern town, as well as the leading character Karl having a long ago history there. Many characters know of him or at least his actions that got him placed into the institution all those years ago, but none of them truly know him as he was very young and few of them know it was he personally who committed such acts. The leading character, while being mentally challenged and a bit difficult to understand at times, is quite likable in spite of his past and you really learn to care for him, knowing that not a single action of his life had true malice behind it as much as simple ignorance.The storyline is interesting, be it a tad unoriginal and simplistic, but perhaps this is not a bad thing at all. The flow is quite smooth, if a little slow at times. The pace is fairly enjoyable, though, constructed and progressed well. It is a fine example of character study, however the supporting characters are a bit shallow and forgotten under the heavy focus of Karl himself.The antagonist is quite convincing and well acted, but the problem there is the lack of a true depth to him. You see several negative acts committed by him, but none that truly warrant him as a bad person but much closer to simply an every day aggressive drunk. He is nothing special or interesting, and while this is the point to his character the movie does not tell you enough about him on an emotional and mental level to really learn to dislike him fairly, it nearly feels forced.Overall, the film is quite good and definitely worth the time you will spend on it. It is a little flat and slow at times, as well as quite predictable, but it has heart and talent behind it. Billy Bob is at his best, and if you are a fan of his you should not miss this film. However, sadly that seems to be the strongest audience that will positively receive it.

This film is excellent for a horror film. It starts off with the previous murders in the house which I thought was pretty cheesy and made me have expectations about the level of Phantasm (which is really enjoyably bad) for this movie. However the acting isn't bad at all and while the flies are silly the other events that happen in the house actually create a good amount of suspense and the end is just great and I don't think over-hyped at all. It certainly is better than the mindless gore-fests that are put out so often these days. In fact its pretty artfully done and reminds me a lot of other 70s classics.This movie has two good points. One is the stand out performance of the priest, father Delaney. He singularly pulls you into the plot and gives the movie a fantastic creepy feel. At least when hes on screen, without him the movie would be pretty vapid. It is his performance that makes the film worth watching at all and his growing mental deterioration and stress is particularly stirring. There is just something about him that makes him immediately empathetic and thus keeps you tied to the movie as he attempts to fight the evil in the house. Hes given a cheesy part, especially in the church scene (a rather silly & weak scene) but hes a believable character.The second good point of the movie is the ending which is classic horror and really fantastic for the date in which it was done. The whole movie is worth sitting through just for the end. The effects show a very surprising restraint keeping from killing or dating the movie with too many sub par effects. Really, the movie is really well done, its just the plot that is weak.All in all its a horror flick. Of course the burial ground, Indian past, Satan worshiper and passage to hell aspects of the plot are cliché, but this is horror. At least this cliché is from the 70s (thus attempts to be artistically portray silly horror stuff like the Stepford Wives) and relies more on suspense than weak effects and has decent continuity. The acting isn't terrible but after watching the most memorable character to me besides the priest was the dog. The eye like windows on the house are a nice touch and the silly effects like the demon pig are kept to a minimum. The blood through the walls and really the whole ending is classic and some of the makeup is great for when it was made.

Clocking in a nearly 4 hours, it seems like an arduous task to watch this film to completion, especially considering the fractured timetable, lack of a solid external throughline, and two rape scenes (one of which being a truly hard piece of cinema to watch), but the masterful direction of Leone, absolutely breathtaking cinematography of Tonino Delli Colli, and epic, tragedy-filled music by Ennio Morricone are guaranteed to pull you into the world of the story. It's a truly rewarding experience to view this film from start to finish in a single sitting. It leaves pieces out of the puzzle for the viewer to interpret, ponder, and debate afterward. It's a film that stays with you and actually rewards repeat viewings.Sadly, there is presently no living director with the skill required to make a film of this caliber. We can only hope and wish that someone comes along and gives us a few cinematic treasures such as this one, The Godfather, Citizen Kane, and the acclaimed films of Kubrick and Hitchcock.Once Upon A Time In America has been on the rise in the IMDb Top 250 for some time now.

And oh, how I wonder how a Leone-directed Godfather would have turned out (along with Orson Welles as Vito and Robert Deniro as Sonny)...Once Upon A Time In America more than makes up for that desire never having the opportunity to come true.I mention The Godfather not only because this film is of the same genre, but also of the same level of quality. Seriously.

It's because it's a film premise that can be easily related to. You can feel and sympathize with each and every character.It's got a huge ensemble cast of A-list actors anchored by Bruce Willis. I know that Bruce Willis is the lead protagonist in the film and receives most screen time and thus, probably most praise. However, I believe, Billy Bob Thornton and William Fichtner really shine most of all. Thornton is not really known for dramatic roles and when it comes to this film, he knows what he's doing almost as good as Tom Hanks. William Fichtner is a favorite of mine because I've seen him in so many roles now and I still can't get passed this performance as it's so mesmerizing.It's not just those three top list actors either, though they powerfully show their intense passion for acting, but also there's the likes of Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Owen Wilson, Michael Clark Duncan, and many many more. It's a ensemble cast, I think, which only amplifies this movie's powerful inspirational premise.As the movie begins, Dan Truman (Thornton) and the rest of NASA find out they have 18 days before an asteroid the size of Texas will destroy Earth and all mankind. It's up to NASA to train Harry Stamper (Willis) and his crew along with Colonel Sharp (Fichtner) to drill a hole, drop a nuke and save the world.As the movie progresses, there's a friction between A.J. (Affleck) and Harry about Harry's daughter, Grace (Liv Tyler) and A.J.'s relationship. Bonds between Harry and Truman form, and all the while you begin to hate General Kimsey (Keith David) as he's not helping the already chaotic situation.At the time of the film's release, Armageddon was one of the highest grossing films and a very high budgeted film. It also boasts some of the most amazing special effects and visual effects to boot. As a tear jerking film, the only downfall to the film is all the factual, geographical and continuity errors. But if you're looking passed the errors to see the film for it's entertainment and not pedantic reasoning, you will enjoy Armageddon.It's known as one of the most epic disaster films of all time along with The Day After Tomorrow and 2012. It's no wonder why Michael Bay is known for his high-action, fast-paced blockbusters nowadays when you see Armageddon as basically his proving ground. It's a great film for all audiences and should not be missed.

While parts of the film were incredibly strange and self-indulgent, the last half of the film is terrific. It's like director David Lynch has a lot of great ability but he's also hampered by a need to too often go over the top--which is odd, as one of his first films, ELEPHANT MAN, was rather restrained and very approachable. However, this is the same director who brought us ERASERHEAD and DUNE--two films, like BLUE VELVET, that have tons and tons of divergent views towards the films. Some have hailed these films as genius while others have reviled them for being too weird, too gross and too stylized to be taken seriously. Overall, this is one of his films that I hate and really, really like at the same time.What's to hate? Well, where to begin?! First, the basic plot of Kyle MacLachlan finding an ear isn't a bad start, but it defied all common sense when the cop investigating told him to forget about the case--yet Kyle, who is NOT to be mistaken for a macho action-hero, decides to investigate the case for himself!! Is he a private detective or does he even carry a gun? No--he's just a guy who works in a hardware store!!!! Does this make any sense at all? Nope. Second, when he does get caught up in the mess behind the ear, the film is so filled with repellent people and bizarreness that you really lose track of the plot. This is especially true to the character played by Dennis Hopper--as he played the most unsubtle character in the history of American film!! A huffing, psychotic, super-pervert whose every third word end in uck sure catches your attention--but is this believable AND does this performance overshadow the entire film--abso-freakin'-lutely. I truly felt that had Hopper's character been toned down just a bit (mostly in the first scenes--he was better later), many more of the audience wouldn't have walked out on the film (and that did apparently happen a lot when it debuted).However, I can't just write this film off as a freak show (though it is, to a degree). There's actually a very, very good second half of the film. Provided you can ignore the plot holes and the similarity between this film and FREAKS, you are left with a film that is, believe it or not, very similar to NORTH BY NORTHWEST. While Kyle certainly isn't to be mistaken for Cary Grant and the violent sex isn't to be confused with the sexual innuendo with Eva Marie Saint in the Hitchcock film, you can see how both characters are ordinary guys who are tossed into the middle of something big and crazy. I loved the last portion of the film because the tension was so extreme and the final confrontation between good and evil was great.I see this film as an interesting but very flawed film that should never be seen by anyone who isn't an adult. However, I realize that the film has 'cult' written all over it--many, many people adore it while many more just don't understand it and don't want to!

It's the story of a young wooden puppet who in his incredible adventures learns to become a real boy so he can go to school, become like all other little boys, and most importantly be loved like a son from the carpenter who created him, Geppetto. Take that immortal tale and re modernize it by making Pinocchio a small robot child, Jiminy Cricket as a robot teddy bear, a loving mother instead of an old poor carpenter, a bratty brother instead of a Fox and Cat and a futuristic American background instead of an old Tuscan one. What you get is A.I.-Artificial Intelligence. A family think they're losing their son Martin and in fear of losing their child they (reluctantly) order a robotic child to replace him. This child is near perfection obedient, doesn't sleep but keeps quiet and still at night, doesn't eat, doesn't break anything, cute, adorable, gentle, innocent and who will remain like that forever. But that's a problem when the real son returns, having been cured from his disease. The real son is jealous, and eventually manages to convince his parents that the robot child is a danger. So they abandon him in the woods, leaving him at the mercy of fate and forcing him to take a journey through robot massacres, brilliant streets and flooded cities. This movie was meant to be directed by the late Stanley Kubrik, but the project was then put in the hands of Steven Spielberg. And one can tell that they both put their souls into this by the fact that it's a perfect mix between Kubrik's intelligence and Spielberg's heart. Also, I believe that Spielberg did a better job than Kubrik ever could've done (and Kubrik said that too before he passed away) and it can be seen not only by the great emotional touch that only the Steve the great possesses, but also from the fact that Kubrik wanted the movie to end at a certain point when Spielberg instead added an extra ending to it which is one of the most touching in movie history. I admit that I am a great Spielberg fan and thus I love everything he does or says, but I also have to admit that the first time I saw this I had absolutely no idea who he was and yet I enjoyed it as much as I do to this day. Why you ask? Because it is a brilliant movie. A perfect cocktail of a story made out of superb directing, wonderful acting, marvelously touching score by John Williams, beautiful look, moral ideals, family drama and with a great theme based on intelligence (both organic and mechanical) and heart.

","genre":null},{"date":"10 January 2009","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Pinocchio, The classic fairy tale written by the Italian Carlo Collodi. It's the story of a young wooden puppet who in his incredible adventures learns to become a real boy so he can go to school, become like all other little boys, and most importantly be loved like a son from the carpenter who created him, Geppetto. Take that immortal tale and re modernize it by making Pinocchio a small robot child, Jiminy Cricket as a robot teddy bear, a loving mother instead of an old poor carpenter, a bratty brother instead of a Fox and Cat and a futuristic American background instead of an old Tuscan one. What you get is A.I.-Artificial Intelligence. A family think they're losing their son Martin and in fear of losing their child they (reluctantly) order a robotic child to replace him. This child is near perfection obedient, doesn't sleep but keeps quiet and still at night, doesn't eat, doesn't break anything, cute, adorable, gentle, innocent and who will remain like that forever. But that's a problem when the real son returns, having been cured from his disease. The real son is jealous, and eventually manages to convince his parents that the robot child is a danger. So they abandon him in the woods, leaving him at the mercy of fate and forcing him to take a journey through robot massacres, brilliant streets and flooded cities. This movie was meant to be directed by the late Stanley Kubrik, but the project was then put in the hands of Steven Spielberg. And one can tell that they both put their souls into this by the fact that it's a perfect mix between Kubrik's intelligence and Spielberg's heart. Also, I believe that Spielberg did a better job than Kubrik ever could've done (and Kubrik said that too before he passed away) and it can be seen not only by the great emotional touch that only the Steve the great possesses, but also from the fact that Kubrik wanted the movie to end at a certain point when Spielberg instead added an extra ending to it which is one of the most touching in movie history. I admit that I am a great Spielberg fan and thus I love everything he does or says, but I also have to admit that the first time I saw this I had absolutely no idea who he was and yet I enjoyed it as much as I do to this day. Why you ask? Because it is a brilliant movie.

You won't find any singing elves in this dark tale, but that's for the best; instead, we get arrows lopping off arms and heads, and a great war between the forest gods and the industrial Irontown.To reveal any more about the plot would be a crime, but suffice it to say, our main character, Ashitaka, is put under a terrible curse, and must find a way to save himself - and the beautiful forest girl San (the Princess Mononoke of the title) - before it's too late.That very small summary right there does this complex movie a disservice; the themes here about the coexistence of man and nature are much more nuanced than that, with no clearly defined heroes or villains. Our two extremes are Lady Eboshi and San - but even as despicable as Eboshi's plot might seem, Miyazaki never lets us forget how very human she is, and the good things she is capable of. Between these two lies Ashitaka, who realizes what the audience only begins to understand by the end of the film.The animation is beautiful, of course, but the absolutely stunning visuals are only a part of what makes this film so beautiful. Everyone should see this movie; it's an experience that's not to be missed.In closing, if this review seems somewhat scatterbrained, it's because it's difficult to express in words just how magnificent and one-of-a-kind this film is. To call this simply one of the greatest animated movies ever made is a disservice to its genius; it is, without a doubt, one of the greatest films of all time, period. A magnificent achievement all around.

Natalie, now 19, saw it and remembered it from her young childhood. She said she thought I would like it. After I watched the movie I asked her why she liked and remembered it so well. She said it was because she likes bull riding. Quite a comment from a 99 pound girl!!Luke Perry is Lane Frost who from a very young age wanted to be a champion bull rider. The movie concentrates on the period in the 1980s when he and his friends traveled all over the southwest in a car, driving from one rodeo to another. Frost was known for his friendliness, big smile, and always willing to help out. And also pay attention to the fans, especially the younger ones.Cynthia Geary (of Northern Exposure fame) is Kellie, a champion barrel racer. At one rodeo the two of them met, soon became more than friends and later married. A central figure in Lane's life was James Rebhorn as his dad Clyde Frost. We see that Clyde, although clearly proud of his son, hardly ever gave Lane praise, but instead often told him that he needed to get tougher, to do better. Even as Lane was approaching world champion status as a bull rider. This had a negative effect and Lane became moody and hard to be around at times.Another key character was Stephen Baldwin as the uneven tempered Tuff Hedeman. As part of the byline at the end of the movie the real Tuff credits Lane with his successful transition in life.Good movie, has a lot of bull riding and a good dramatic story.SPOILERS Anyone who knows the history of this story also knows that Lane Frost met an untimely death in 1989, ironically just a few months after Natalie was born. He has just had a successful ride and jumped onto the ground. The bull turned and gored him such that a rib broke and punctured a major artery near his heart. He died there in the rodeo arena of excessive bleeding. He was still in his 20s.

They take a lot of drugs, drink, steal and have sex with young girls. Telly only sleeps with virgins because he believes wouldn't get STD and just a lot better then someone who ready had sex. He deliberately seeks out young girls just so he can take their virginity, which shows he is a uncaring bastard and slightly pedophilic. The film focuses on one day in their lives in New York City. One of Telly's victims, 16-year-old Jennie (Chloe Sevigny) finds out she cause the HIV virus off Telly, the only bloke she had sex with. She searching the city to tell Telly that he has got the virus.This film tackles a lot of dark films from urban youth culture, sex, drugs, date rape, HIV and STDs. It shows how ruthless some blokes are to have sex. This film doesn't pull any punches. But at the same time the film seems aimless, just like its characters. As well the film two leads are completely unsympathetic, making you are not care or just wanting them to suffer. I think the film may have had a better impact focusing on Jennie who was a just girl who life is thrown into chaos or one of Telly's victims or a member of their crew who was having doubts about their activities. But then that's the way I would tackle it. The film takes a grim, realist approach, similar to British film-making which works for the storytelling. As well the young actors do well with a tough picture.If you look like this film I recommend watching Thriteen, Kidulthood and best of all A Clockwork Orange.I personally give Kids a 3 out 5.
