Someone like me who has knowledge of Hunter S. Thompson, his friends, and gonzo journalism, will definitely not get this movie or love it as much as the people who know a lot about it. Hunter S. Thompson seems like the man who has broken everything that every religion says about drugs along with his friend Dr Gonzo. I haven't researched him up but if he sounds, looks, and talks like what Johnny Depp Portrayed in the film, then he surely is weird. Johnny Depp has probably made this character look presentable on screen at best. Johnny Depp is an amazing actor who has starred in a lot of masterpieces that, definitely, includes Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas. I love his mannerism, his speech in the film, and of course, I loved his performance to the point of extreme madness. Benicio Del Toro on the other hand was immaculate as well for portraying an overweight lawyer and friend Of Raoul Duke (Hunter S. Thompson) who looks disgusting on the screen. His part was one of the most disturbing character studies ever, it was a mix between the cannibals out of Wrong Turn and Hannibal Lecter. That is how disturbing it was. The film itself will make you high with pleasure as you see life through the two mismatched pairs as they are being taken over by hundred drugs of drugs. The film will go all fuzzy and twirly, and swirly forever when the the duo are on drugs and at times, they see imaginary creatures like bats over their heads. Scenes like those are very hard to digest and very annoying because you don't really know what is going on. I give two thumbs up for the brilliant narration, spoken by Johnny Depp, because sometimes, as I have said before that, the film will be hard to take in and the narration will elaborate more on what is happening. The narration was also great to hear because it had a great voice saying the narration and it also contains a lot of expression. Tobey Maguire plays the Hitchhiker, a character without a background and who has long white hair that looks vile. Tobey Maguire was still in his rookiness and so I fail to give him a positive review about his performance. Aside from this small role, we also see Camera Diaz who is listed on IMDb as the Blonde TV Woman taking on somebody who has a negative encounter with one of the boys who has a gun. Cameron Diaz will happily get a positive review from me.An adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's novel of the same name. The film details a whacky search for the American Dream, by Thompson and his crazed, Samoan lawyer. Fueled by the massive amount of drugs they purchased with an advance from a magazine to cover a sporting event in Vegas; they set out in the Red Shark. Encountering police, reporters, gamblers, racers, and hitchhikers; they search for some undefinable thing know only as the American Dream and find fear, loathing and hilarious adventures into the dementia of the modern American West.The music used in this motion picture has been greatly chosen. This film contains songs by Jefferson Airplane who have a song called White Rabbit that immediately caught my attention and another song by them called Somebody To Love which was glamorous as well. There are also songs by The Blues Brothers, The Young Bloods, Frank Sinatra, and many, many more. One other thing I want to talk about is Johnny Depp's hair in this film and how absurd it looks. It might have belonged to Hunter S. Thompson but it doesn't look good on Johnny, I don't know why I brought up the hair thing but isn't it weird? Terry Gilliam has some notable films on his list and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas has to be one of the notable film. This film came to be a surprise and I didn't expect much out of it but it is quite promising to those who understand it. I recommend this film to people who have no Life! That was a joke, right?

If you've seen one, you've seen them all. We've all memorized the formula and the variables by now. Jocks, cheerleaders, outcasts, the boy\/girl next door, or loners must overcome either social status, circumstances beyond their control, or the expectations of others, in order to win the prize, which is usually the heart of a particularly good-looking member of the opposite sex. Teen movies tend to be set in a high school, so that we get to see all of the above social groups together in action, and they tend to involve numerous elements of yeah right&#x85;like that would ever really happen. 10 Things I Hate About You has all of the above. AND YET...this movie is amazing. Thanks to an excellent cast, fine performances, a good soundtrack, and above all, an amazingly witty script, 10 Things I Hate About You is one of the best teen movies around. Loosely based on William Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew, this movie is a must-see. (No, I won't list 10 Reasons I Love 10 Things I Hate About You. Although I'm sure I could name 10.) The story is fairly simple new guy Cameron (variable boy next door) comes to Padua High, where he is shown the ropes by former A\/V god Michael (variable geek). Cameron immediately spots the beautiful Bianca Stratford (variable gorgeous shallow airhead), and immediately falls in love. There's only one problem Bianca's overbearing protective OB\/GYN father refuses to let her date until her sister Kat (variable loner) dates. Male model Joey Donner (variable jock) also wants to date Bianca, so he pays bad boy Patrick Verona (variable bad boy) to date Kat. Of course, Patrick ends up falling for Kat, and Bianca blows off the sweet and perfect-for-her Cameron for the self-absorbed Joey, until Cameron illustrates the difference between a gentleman and a user, and it's revealed that Joey was just planning to nail Bianca at prom, if you know what I mean. Needless to say, Bianca learns her lesson, punches Joey in the face and chooses Cameron, and after their own share of relationship problems, which culminate in Kat's reading of her sonnet appropriately titled Ten Things I Hate About You, Patrick and Kat fall in love and no doubt end up living happily ever after. Julia Stiles plays the female lead role of Kat Stratford, a high school senior with a reputation for being aloof and cold. She doesn't wear makeup or jewelry, likes girl bands and guitars, and doesn't give a damn what anyone thinks about her. She regards prom as an event where students get all dressed up, so some Drakkar Noir-wearing dexter with a boner can feel you up while you're forced to listen to a band that, by definition, blows. Stiles delivers her sharp one-liner opinions and social observations with pitch-perfect sarcasm, and yet somehow manages to never let her audience forget that Kat is human and has a softer &#x96; maybe even vulnerable! &#x96; side. Stiles' role is a refreshing reminder to teens that you don't always have to be what they want you to be, and we never doubt that Kat truly doesn't care what other people think of her, and that she does what she wants for her own benefit.Kat's sister Bianca, as played by the perfectly cast Larisa Oleynik, is the polar opposite. Bianca is beautiful and shallow, and happens to like being adored, thank you. Oleynik portrays Bianca's shallowness and conceit perfectly, and yet we still like Bianca because she is still innocent and unaware of what a user Joey eat me Donner is. One of Oleynik's best moments is when Cameron calls her out on her selfishness; Bianca admits to being selfish and conceited, and her embarrassment and shame are evident without her saying a word. Though she isn't given as much to work with as Stiles, Oleynik manages to shine in her role.The rest of the cast Heath Ledger as Patrick Verona, Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Cameron James, David Krumholtz as Michael, Andrew Keegan as Joey, Larry Miller as Walter Stratford, and particularly Allison Janney as the guidance counselor, are simply superb. Heath Ledger's bad boy role softens as the movie progresses, until the guy who drilled a hole in Cameron's French textbook encourages him to pursue Bianca because he's ten times the man Joey is. Gordon-Levitt is first-rate as the sweet boy-next-door Cameron, and his awkward sincerity and heart of gold are established from his first scene. Krumholtz and Keegan are perfect in their respective roles of geek and jerk, and Larry Miller and Allison Janney are simply sensational as the heads of the adult cast. Watch Janney's two-scene cameo in particular &#x96; you will be in awe of how hilarious this woman can really be. And finally, the script. Each line seems to have been injected with as much wit and hilarity as possible. Writers Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith have carefully sculpted almost every line to fit each particular character perfectly. The delivery and timing of each jab at teen society is brilliant. 10 Things I Hate About You has it all a perfect cast, an incredible script, and an awesome soundtrack. See it now.

It wasn't the best movie of this kind that I've seen, but it was good enough that I'm pleased to add it to the list of movies that I've seen. Fans of the genre will probably love it (tbough I'm sure 95% of those people have seen it already), while people like me won't feel like they're wasting their time while watching it.

Indeed, much of the action sequences are inspired greatly by those old warhorse action movies the James Bond series. What happens in between will frustrate some, though I didn't feel it was completely unnecessary, mostly because there is quite a bit of humor laced throughout. I must start out by declaring that this is James Cameron's weakest film. This must be attributed to the fact that the plot itself is not very strong, thus leading to some less than stellar sequences that don't add up to much. Yet, once again, the action sequences stand out as beyond anything I have seen in the majority of action films since this one. Cameron continues in every single one of his films to push the bar not just in special effects, but also in the sheer quality and expansion of his vision. He never lets up when feeding us explosions and crazy stunts and I lapped that up. What this film truly lacks is any complex or interesting characters. Everyone from Arnie's Harry Tasker to Jamie Lee Curtis's boring wife Helen simply do and don't have much conviction to them. Watching this movie, I truly felt it was being acted out, not thoroughly convincing. The hero is typically flawed but decent, the wife boring but craving excitement, the daughter estranged from her folks and the villain eagerly wanting world domination. So much of the plot exists in stereotypes, I am not surprised many feminists and Arabs were upset over the depiction of their respective groups. The plot follows the typical Bond story, even including a femme fatale that tries to get on the hero's good side. The big twist included here is that this Bond is married, which gives some interesting tidbits of ideas such as Harry wondering if his wife is having an affair and intertwining that with his covert operations (which I doubt is realistic). Yet, overall the film drags quite a bit in the middle and leaves much to be desired. The opening and closing action sequences are quite amazing as you wonder yet again how Cameron was able to do that. Nevertheless, story is key and there is not much of one here. However, I must confess that James Cameron is for me one of the great auteurs of the last half century. Of his seven features, five of them can be argued as either great or masterpieces. While True Lies doesn't come close to the incredible scope and ambition of films like Aliens or Titanic, Cameron is unable to make a film so static and uninteresting that it is so forgettable. But if he happened to do so, this would be the biggest qualifier.

The hero is typically flawed but decent, the wife boring but craving excitement, the daughter estranged from her folks and the villain eagerly wanting world domination. So much of the plot exists in stereotypes, I am not surprised many feminists and Arabs were upset over the depiction of their respective groups. The plot follows the typical Bond story, even including a femme fatale that tries to get on the hero's good side. The big twist included here is that this Bond is married, which gives some interesting tidbits of ideas such as Harry wondering if his wife is having an affair and intertwining that with his covert operations (which I doubt is realistic). Yet, overall the film drags quite a bit in the middle and leaves much to be desired. The opening and closing action sequences are quite amazing as you wonder yet again how Cameron was able to do that. Nevertheless, story is key and there is not much of one here. However, I must confess that James Cameron is for me one of the great auteurs of the last half century. Of his seven features, five of them can be argued as either great or masterpieces. While True Lies doesn't come close to the incredible scope and ambition of films like Aliens or Titanic, Cameron is unable to make a film so static and uninteresting that it is so forgettable.

Indeed, much of the action sequences are inspired greatly by those old warhorse action movies the James Bond series. What happens in between will frustrate some, though I didn't feel it was completely unnecessary, mostly because there is quite a bit of humor laced throughout. I must start out by declaring that this is James Cameron's weakest film. This must be attributed to the fact that the plot itself is not very strong, thus leading to some less than stellar sequences that don't add up to much. Yet, once again, the action sequences stand out as beyond anything I have seen in the majority of action films since this one. Cameron continues in every single one of his films to push the bar not just in special effects, but also in the sheer quality and expansion of his vision. He never lets up when feeding us explosions and crazy stunts and I lapped that up. What this film truly lacks is any complex or interesting characters.

This shortcoming was overcome brilliantly in the amazing Broadway revival from a few years ago. Unfortunately, the film version shares neither the narrative strengths of the original stage production nor the energy and canny instincts of its latter-day revival. Director\/choreographer Bob Fosse makes some very strange and not necessarily good decisions in rendering the material from stage to film. Most detrimental is his choice to cut any musical numbers that cannot be placed on stage at the Kit Kat Club in Berlin (with one notable exception), which means a large quantity of numbers fall by the wayside. To somewhat compensate, he has added some new material, of which only Mein Herr is really memorable. He has also cut or minimized characters from the source and failed to suitably replace their loss. For instance, the doomed second-string romance between a German landlady and Jewish tenant, which resonates strongly because this may be their last chance at love, has been replaced by a romance between rich beautiful young Gentile Marisa Berensen and poor Jewish guy Fritz Wepper, which has absolutely no dramatic impact at all. Berensen comes across as a spoiled glamor puss only mildly disappointed in the thwarted romance, which is depicted very half-heartedly by Fosse. It seems inconceivable that Grey won an Oscar up against the majority of the supporting cast from The Godfather. Not because he is bad, but because his role as the Emcee is so inconsequential in the film. He really has no wow moments and his much-acclaimed Money number is even watered-down in that he is forced to share it with leading lady Liza Minnelli. The leading romance in the film is a total bust. Michael York and Minnelli share no chemistry. Fosse adds a new character played by Helmut Griem to turn it into some kind of bisexual love triangle, which must have seemed daring in 1972, but the allusions to naughtiness are all we are left with and it simply fails to impress. As for Minnelli, Cabaret would become her last cinematic highlight. She is not remotely convincing as a second-rate chanteuse in a run-down Berlin night club, nor is she believable as an object of lust. With so much make-up splashed on her and her unflattering bob cut, Minnelli often comes across as Divine's svelte younger sister. She does well by some of the songs, but her Sally Bowle's has no depth whatsoever. In both the Isherwood stories and in the stage play, Bowles may well be a self-destructive party girl, but she comes to realize it. Minnelli seems to have no self-realization whatsoever. When her character has an abortion in the play, she recognizes both her self-destructive and selfish streaks. In the film, when Minnelli claims not to know why she had an abortion - she really appears to be clueless - as if a page of her script got stuck together. In all versions of the play, the Sally's have realized that the happy corpse of Elsie sung about in the title song actually may well be herself. In the film, Minnelli belts out the number with no introspection or subtlety - she realizes she has a hot number and nothing more. I think Minnelli is quite accomplished in the earlier Sterile Cuckoo, but this must have been a really weak actress year at the Oscars if her over-the-top mugging and sledgehammer delivery is what took home the gold. Unfortunately, she has been playing this way on screen - with mercifully less frequency - ever since.

Over the top violence? Check. Gibson cast as a one-dimensional character who endures a ridiculous amount of physical turmoil? Check. Cartoony villains? Check. Death(s) of major supporting character(s) to give Gibson's lead a motivated vendetta? Check. The depiction of the British army is so laughable that it seems impossible they could have ever amassed an empire at all much less won any hard fought battles.

Basically psychiatrist Dr. Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal) has problems with his parents not wanting him to get married to Laura MacNamara (Friends' Lisa Kudrow), being under-looked because of his doctor father Isaac (Bill Macy), and his patients not giving him challenging problems. Manhattan mob boss Paul Vitti (Golden Globe nominated Robert De Niro) suddenly has sudden anxiety attacks and is having some sort of nervous breakdown, crying for almost no reason and feeling like he's losing his mind. After coincidently crashing into his car and given his contact card, Paul turns up at Ben's office wanting his help to analyse him in two weeks, before a big mob meeting. Being in the company of the mob, and with his wedding to Laura coming up, Ben definitely feels challenged now, mainly for his and others safety, and called upon by Paul almost 24 hours. Ben, while at the same time trying to keep things under control, is trying to get through to Paul, but his mob ways and not great attitude to things normal are a big problem. Ben does eventually make a breakthrough when Paul confesses that he feels responsible for his father's death, and as thanks Paul makes Ben attend the big meeting while he is late. In the end, Paul and all the other mob bosses are arrested, but Ben manages to get married in his second wedding, very quickly, and keeps in contact with Paul. Also starring Joe Viterelli as Jelly, Chazz Palminteri as Primo Sidone, The Grinch's Molly Shannon as Caroline and Max Casella as Nicky Shivers. De Niro does really well with his regular GoodFellas gangster persona and comic one-liners, Crystal is great as the pressured shrink, and while it is mainly the dialogue that gets the laughs, it is good fun. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy\/Musical. Very good!

Towards the end he tries to let his lawyer know he's killed people, but no one will listen to him and this is the closest he gets to having any form of logical knowledge.

The desert actually felt like the fourth character in a way that does not happen that often. The acting was alright even though it was over the top. I did enjoy all of the movie with the exception of the one scene. I really liked the opening and it really showed how to slowly build tension.

The main reason I watched this movie is because the greatest Indian movie made Sholay is inspired by Magnificent Seven. So I was expecting a lot from this but sadly it didn't live up to my expectations.The story is very simple. A distant Mexican village is continually haunted by a Rouge Bandit and his 40 men. They take most of their hard earned crops\/money and leave them with just bare minimum to survive. When enough goes enough the villagers hires 7 gunmen to chase the gangsters away and restore peace in the village. And the rest of the movie is about the action and dramatic run of one side out-smarting another in series of skirmishes.Before elucidating my grievances I want to shower praises on the breathtaking cinematography and art design of the movie which has created captivating scenery of Mexican village and its rural life. But other than this the movie doesn't deem to be uphold-ed in high esteem. Western movies are known for their haunting music and stylish action sequences. Magnificent 7 lacks in both. It's emotionally barren and dramatically shallow in its treatment. The major weaknesses of the movie are..1.The movie is quite shallow and at no point in time you feel attached to any situation of character. Even the innocence of little village children fail to melt my heart. Instead they were an unnecessary aberration in flow of the movie.2.The love story is too shallow and even fails the attempt to showcase the carnal desires of the protagonists.3.The acting of the side casts (villagers, bandits, children etc.) is horrendous. Most of the times, they were looking in some other direction and speaking in another. Seems they were only interested in their payment not in acting. Surprisingly our bollywood side staff acts better than this.4.Other than Steve Mcqueen , Yul Brynner and the young lad.

It seems that during the film the director forgets that script demands to kill heroes and when he realizes this in the end, he haphazardly kills them without putting any creativity and drama into it.6.The music is a big letdown keeping in mind the memorable music of westerners which keeps playing in your mind months after the movie.7.The movie is too long 2 hours 15 minutes.Bollywood filmmakers and Fans should be proud of the creation of SHOLAY which is emotionally deep and technically so strong that Magnificent 7 seems like a B Grade (read C Grade) copy of it.
