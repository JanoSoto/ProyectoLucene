It is thrilling, simply mesmerizing watching Franka Potente and Benno Fürmann carrying out what Tykwer has written, this captivating study of two strangers' lives somehow intertwined. Predestined timing, unexpected circumstances&#133;it's intriguing and thought-provoking. Tykwer is so imaginative and resourceful in the characters he illustrates. There are befitting details and skillful graphic presentations of his story, its plot progressions. It's actually quite methodical as if following a grid built for this particular film. The music, again, Tykwer created together with Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heil (they now call themselves Pale 3) - definitely complements the atmosphere and development of the story. Tykwer's favorite theme, fate, is very much front and center this time. And you can't not follow Potente's character Sissi's plight - we are drawn to her, just as she's magnetized towards Bodo, Fürmann's obscure character (you might say he is 'the man who cried' vs. Johnny Depp's character in the movie of the same name.) Bodo is a mystery unto himself. Complex backgrounds, indeed, yet fascinating to follow the truths unraveling. Viewers will feel clever connecting the clues and missing links, and absolutely surrender to being in the midst of this Tykwer-spun entanglement. THE PRINCESS AND THE WARRIOR is more serious and in-depth in storyline than 1998's RUN LOLA RUN. It is more of a rarefied fairytale than 1996's WINTER SLEEPERS realities. The pairing of Franka Potente and Benno Fürmann alone is enough of an attraction to this Tykwer down-to-earth magical film. He is giving us the harsh reality of fate and being alive, making us think about the nearness of death. It's all so real and yet, unreal - or is it? Can love dissolve walls? Can the two together fly? It prompts us that we CAN let go of tormenting pasts, take a bold leap (or jump rather) forward and start anew, come what may. And yes, with a total stranger should fate so destine. Ah, that rare human valuable - TRUST. Another kudos to Sony Pictures Classics for the wisdom of bringing us this sparkling diamond of a Tom Tykwer production. Thrice delivered supreme quality filmic experience storytelling creativity, innovative techniques, both visual and aural. This film has elements measured up to Hollywood productions, its sets, cinematography, locales, even scenarios reminiscent of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest 1975, yet a unique spellbinding human story when Sissi met Bodo.

For one day, acrossdistant and not so distant lands, it is foretold that people will breakout into a dance as this film still screens late - very late -  in theeternal night. They call this strange gyration... The Time Warp........You will do the time warp again? Won't you? I envy the person who hasn't seen this classic. Its amazing how magicalthis film remains almost 30 years after its initial release. It remainsa rare incredible gem full of joy and yet so sincerely clever. One ofthe best examples of this film's brilliance is its subversion of thehero\/villain relationship. Nobody is who they seem in this film and theroles turn every character inside out. Dr Frank N Furter switches wildlyfrom camp queen to vicious leader to crumbling diva. Tim Curry'sperformance remains a spunky, full throttle embrace of absolutepleasure. The songs remain rollicking, engaging and even beautifullymelancholic - especially Frank's final tunes in the film. Don't dreamit, be it is so sad and yet so brilliant a final coda for the film.This is a dream made cinematic. Long may it live to do the time warpagain and take us back to our first corruption\/eruption.

No chit-chat? That's the problem with the world these days - no one takes the time to conduct the proper sinister interrogation.This exchange in `Goldeneye' probably best sums up the Pierce Brosnan era of 007 &#150; this isn't your father's 007 anymore.  Sure, `Goldeneye' features a lot of the obligatory trappings of every James Bond movie made since 1963's `Goldfinger' elaborate chase scenes, gadgets, a bad girl with a name laced with sexual innuendo, and a megalomaniacal villain obsessed with taking over the world.  However, there's also a new attempt to bring 007 into the modern world.  As played by Pierce Brosnan, James Bond is still the cold, calculating, womanizing spy he's always been, but the arrogance has been tempered with a bit of self-awareness . . . and even a little remorse.  Brosnan is also the first Bond to even slightly recognize how absurd some of the situations he's involved in really are &#150; hey, he couldn't chastise the villain for failing to reveal his grandiose plan for world domination if he didn't recognize this. Brosnan's Bond is a more adult, somber hero than his predecessors &#150; while this makes for a more well-rounded, three dimensional, believable character, it's debatable as to whether or not this makes for better Bond.  More on that in a second.But as for the film `Goldeneye' &#150; pretty darn good, if not great.  Wisely avoiding the `Thunderball' template that so many Bond films seem to blindly follow (submarines and nuclear missiles), `Goldeneye' instead starts with a vacationing James Bond (Brosnan), who meets the lovely but deadly Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen, in one of the best Bond `bad girl' performances of all time).  Xenia is part of a Russian mafia team trying to steal an experimental helicopter that is insulated against all forms of electronic jamming &#150; Bond, of course, tries to stop her, but not before getting a little frisky with her first.  Xenia succeeds, leading Bond to investigate why she would want to steal that specific helicopter &#150; and he uncovers a plot involving the space satellite `Goldeneye', capable of unleashing electromagnetic pulses that can completely disrupt all electronic transmissions and functions anywhere in the world.  Xenia is just part of a larger plan, one involving some rogue Russian military officers &#150; and a rogue, evil ex-British Secret Service agent, 006 (Sean Bean).  Whoever controls the Goldeneye satellite can conceivably control the world, so once again, it's up to James Bond to save the world . . .The action contained in `Goldeneye' is admittedly spectacular.  (In fact, the action sequences of all the Brosnan Bond movies are impressive.)  The opening sequence involving a free-fall off a perilously high cliff without a parachute is simply awesome, and later segments get the adrenaline racing as well.  The story is also pretty darn good &#150; while not exactly Shakespeare, it covers all the standard Bond elements fairly well. There's a lot of razor-sharp dialogue between the characters, the plot is fairly original, the story crackles along at a good pace, and the ludicrous plot holes are kept to a bare minimum.  The main (and only) gripe with both the story and the action . . . well, it just doesn't have the feel of a 007 film.  Take out Pierce Brosnan and the references to the British Secret Service, insert Bruce Willis, and `Goldeneye' could be a generic action film.  There's small touches missing from both action and story that keep `Goldeneye' from having the true feel of a Bond film &#150; it's missing things like the hilarious golfing scene from `Goldfinger', or the final confrontation of `Man With the Golden Gun'.  It's not a major gripe, but `Goldeneye' is simply too generic, as if someone took a standard action screenplay, inserted a few names like 007, M, and Q, and thought that was enough to make a classic Bond movie.  It's enough to make a pretty good Bond movie, I guess, but the formula falls short of being great &#150; or being a classic.As for the cast &#150; first rate, for the most part.  As mentioned before, Famke Janssen practically steals the film as Xenia Onatopp, a sadomasochistic sex kitten from hell.  Equal parts camp and vicious brutality, Janssen makes Xenia one of the most memorable Bond characters in quite a long time.  The `good girl' of the film &#150; Natalya Simonova (played by Izabella Scorupco) is excellent as well &#150; while not exactly believable as one of the world's best computer programmers, she shows enough charm, wit and style to be more than simple arm candy for 007.  Sean Bean is pretty good as the rogue agent 006, but the character is so quiet and deadly serious that he almost fades into the background at times.  A little more over-the-top outrage would've made 006 a better Bond villain.  Special mention must be made of Desmond Llewelyn, who never, ever disappointed as Q, and Dame Judi Dench as the `new' M . . . it's definitely a guilty pleasure to see an actress of her esteemed caliber slumming in a Bond flick and loving every minute of it.  And Pierce Brosnan &#150; well, he's one of the best Bonds ever (second only to Sean Connery).  Debonair, cold, and confident, Brosnan effortlessly exudes a lot of the qualities that make 007 great . . . and have been missing for quite a while.  The only issue I have with Brosnan as Bond is the change towards the introspective, fallible, `21st century' Bond &#150; but that's not Brosnan's fault.  Still, part of the `charm' of 007 is his complete ruthlessness (and if don't think Bond is ruthless, watch the first few Sean Connery 007 films again), and the introduction of self-introspection and doubt takes away from the established character.  Change can be good at times, but this one isn't.  A minor quibble, to be sure . . . but it's there nonetheless, and it's held Brosnan back from possibly being the best 007 of all time.Overall, `Goldeneye' is a quality film that's packed with action and is also a lot of fun.  If you're a die-hard Bond fan (like myself), you'll probably walk away from it a wee bit disappointed, but for the most part, it's still undeniably entertaining.  One of the better Bond films, and to date, possibly Pierce Brosnan's best Bond film.

However, there's also a new attempt to bring 007 into the modern world.  As played by Pierce Brosnan, James Bond is still the cold, calculating, womanizing spy he's always been, but the arrogance has been tempered with a bit of self-awareness . . . and even a little remorse.  Brosnan is also the first Bond to even slightly recognize how absurd some of the situations he's involved in really are &#150; hey, he couldn't chastise the villain for failing to reveal his grandiose plan for world domination if he didn't recognize this. Brosnan's Bond is a more adult, somber hero than his predecessors &#150; while this makes for a more well-rounded, three dimensional, believable character, it's debatable as to whether or not this makes for better Bond.  More on that in a second.But as for the film `Goldeneye' &#150; pretty darn good, if not great.  Wisely avoiding the `Thunderball' template that so many Bond films seem to blindly follow (submarines and nuclear missiles), `Goldeneye' instead starts with a vacationing James Bond (Brosnan), who meets the lovely but deadly Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen, in one of the best Bond `bad girl' performances of all time).  Xenia is part of a Russian mafia team trying to steal an experimental helicopter that is insulated against all forms of electronic jamming &#150; Bond, of course, tries to stop her, but not before getting a little frisky with her first.  Xenia succeeds, leading Bond to investigate why she would want to steal that specific helicopter &#150; and he uncovers a plot involving the space satellite `Goldeneye', capable of unleashing electromagnetic pulses that can completely disrupt all electronic transmissions and functions anywhere in the world.  Xenia is just part of a larger plan, one involving some rogue Russian military officers &#150; and a rogue, evil ex-British Secret Service agent, 006 (Sean Bean).  Whoever controls the Goldeneye satellite can conceivably control the world, so once again, it's up to James Bond to save the world . . .The action contained in `Goldeneye' is admittedly spectacular.  (In fact, the action sequences of all the Brosnan Bond movies are impressive.)  The opening sequence involving a free-fall off a perilously high cliff without a parachute is simply awesome, and later segments get the adrenaline racing as well.  The story is also pretty darn good &#150; while not exactly Shakespeare, it covers all the standard Bond elements fairly well. There's a lot of razor-sharp dialogue between the characters, the plot is fairly original, the story crackles along at a good pace, and the ludicrous plot holes are kept to a bare minimum.  The main (and only) gripe with both the story and the action . . . well, it just doesn't have the feel of a 007 film.  Take out Pierce Brosnan and the references to the British Secret Service, insert Bruce Willis, and `Goldeneye' could be a generic action film.  There's small touches missing from both action and story that keep `Goldeneye' from having the true feel of a Bond film &#150; it's missing things like the hilarious golfing scene from `Goldfinger', or the final confrontation of `Man With the Golden Gun'.  It's not a major gripe, but `Goldeneye' is simply too generic, as if someone took a standard action screenplay, inserted a few names like 007, M, and Q, and thought that was enough to make a classic Bond movie.  It's enough to make a pretty good Bond movie, I guess, but the formula falls short of being great &#150; or being a classic.As for the cast &#150; first rate, for the most part.  As mentioned before, Famke Janssen practically steals the film as Xenia Onatopp, a sadomasochistic sex kitten from hell.  Equal parts camp and vicious brutality, Janssen makes Xenia one of the most memorable Bond characters in quite a long time.  The `good girl' of the film &#150; Natalya Simonova (played by Izabella Scorupco) is excellent as well &#150; while not exactly believable as one of the world's best computer programmers, she shows enough charm, wit and style to be more than simple arm candy for 007.  Sean Bean is pretty good as the rogue agent 006, but the character is so quiet and deadly serious that he almost fades into the background at times.  A little more over-the-top outrage would've made 006 a better Bond villain.  Special mention must be made of Desmond Llewelyn, who never, ever disappointed as Q, and Dame Judi Dench as the `new' M . . . it's definitely a guilty pleasure to see an actress of her esteemed caliber slumming in a Bond flick and loving every minute of it.  And Pierce Brosnan &#150; well, he's one of the best Bonds ever (second only to Sean Connery).  Debonair, cold, and confident, Brosnan effortlessly exudes a lot of the qualities that make 007 great . . . and have been missing for quite a while.  The only issue I have with Brosnan as Bond is the change towards the introspective, fallible, `21st century' Bond &#150; but that's not Brosnan's fault.  Still, part of the `charm' of 007 is his complete ruthlessness (and if don't think Bond is ruthless, watch the first few Sean Connery 007 films again), and the introduction of self-introspection and doubt takes away from the established character.  Change can be good at times, but this one isn't.  A minor quibble, to be sure . . . but it's there nonetheless, and it's held Brosnan back from possibly being the best 007 of all time.Overall, `Goldeneye' is a quality film that's packed with action and is also a lot of fun.  If you're a die-hard Bond fan (like myself), you'll probably walk away from it a wee bit disappointed, but for the most part, it's still undeniably entertaining.

This is not a film to be taken lightly, but a serious examination of the horrors of war and individual conflicts and struggles, and for that it is on par with Steven Spielberg's work on Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List, certainly a noteworthy comparison.  The film opens in 1973, with the Vietnam War coming to an end.  But the horror is far from over.  The Khmer Rouge, a radical political group, are slowly taking over war-torn Cambodia.  The film's first 2\/3's chronicles the journeys and friendships of two journalists, Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterston) and Dith Pran (Haing S. Ngor), as well as photographer Al Rockoff (John Malkovich) and another photographer, a British man named Jon Swain (Julian Sands).The American Embassy makes the crucial decision to evacuate but Schanberg refuses to leave, and his partner Pran, out of a sense of loyalty, also willingly stays behind while his family is evacuated.  But trouble ensues, and Pran is eventually forced to remain in Cambodia and must struggle to survive re-education camps and the Killing Fields.Of all the films to involve the Vietnam War (technically, though, the focus of this is on Cambodia), The Killing Fields ranks above them all.  It is even more harrowing than Oliver Stone's Platoon, more realistic than Apocalypse Now and Full Metal jacket, and more intensely personal than The Deer Hunter.  This film remains something of a forgotten relic, losing the Best Picture award of 1984 to the undeserving Amadeus, but The Killing Field's importance and impact have remained, and perhaps by today's standards, has an even more terrifying imprint.Perfectly directed, this easily remains director Roland Joffe's best work to date (and he'll probably never surpass it).  It's something of a tragedy to see him take a step backward with every film he has gone on to make (The Mission, the disastrous The Scarlet Letter).  But his work on this film is still by far one of the most impressive I've seen in this genre.  He captures the insanity of the time period, the political confusion, the chaos, and the downright terrors of war; doing all of this not from a soldier's point of view, but from civilians, most particularly Dith Pran.The war-torn chaos featured in the first hour-and-a-half give way to an intense struggle for survival in the last hour.  The focus is on Dith Pran and the tortures he goes through.  It is here that the film takes an apocalyptic look and stance, and the sight of hundreds of dead bodies in a long, single ditch remains one of the most horrifying and shocking sights ever put on film.Suspenseful is a way to describe the film, yet it is far more nail-biting than the usual Hollywood-churned thriller.  It's impressive how director Joffe creates so much tension from so many situations.  From the beginning when we see the evacuation to the point where the journalists try to fake a passport to keep Pran in the embassy; all these moments are simply heart-pounding.Those scenes seem almost obligatory in comparison to the last 1\/3, which focuses on Pran almost entirely.  Every scene in these last 50 mintues, I was left constantly praying and hoping he'd make it out and I literally gripped my seat every moment, wondering whether he'd be discovered or whether he'd be able to escape.    The film is so riveting not only because of Joffe's direction, but also because of the individual characters whom we grow to not only care for, but also feel like we're in the same situation with.  Haing Ngor carries the load as Dith Pran, and comes through magnificently.  Having faced the actual terrors of war in Cambodia, Ngor is brilliantly effective, and he easily delivered what must have been the best performance of the 80's. Sam Waterston is almost as good as Sydney Schanberg, Pran's close friend who feels guilty for having let Pran stay behind during the evacuation.  It is his drive to get the news down that places Pran in danger, and though we're aware of this, there's never a moment when we aren't touched by Waterston's torn feelings.  This is his best performance to date.The supporting cast is also very good, most notably John Malkovich as the photographer who seems a little odd at first, but is pretty much the average guy who also sympathizes for Pran's plight (and, as a result, ends up arguing with Schanberg).  Julian Sands is also effective as the photographer whose life as well as Schanberg's and Rockoff's, was saved by Pran and he tries his best to return the favor.The Killing Fields, while certainly a bloody violent film and almost always depresses the hell out of you, is ultimately more inspirational than anything else.  This may be a flinching, no-holds barred experience, but it is one that must be seen.  This is truly an unforgettable film, and one of my personal favorites.

Throughout the film, all of the characters are cursed with aberrant sexual desires, relentless sexual desires, or sexual desires that might well get them killed. So the basic notion of this film is that one or two women in this film are extremely manipulative and sexual creatures who will kill each other or so-called innocent third parties just for the sake of manipulation.It really comes as no surprise Paul Verhoeven would only work on one more film with Eszterhas, given that the latter can't seem to see women in general as anything other than whores, nymphs, deviants, punching bags, or general tools for the men to use. I only know of one Verhoeven film besides Basic Instinct and Showgirls where feminine characters are displayed in such an utterly negative light, and in that one, Starship Troopers, the characterisation is more based on actual events in the lives of army recruits than a pointless, disabling fear. Mankind may well be afraid of the unknown, but women have existed at least as long as men, which makes misogyny like this hard to take at all seriously.Then there's the plot twists. Granted, this would be an utterly boring thriller if the same suspect was actually the killer all the way through the film. The best way to look at the sequence of murders is to believe that different people killed each victim. It makes things a little easier to digest, since the final plot twist pretty much negates every other in the film unless you look at it in these broad terms. I think Eszterhas was just trying to be clever for a change instead of hateful.Michael Douglas is right in his element as the burned out detective who lives from day to day without really caring about his work. Michael's easy-going, apathetic style of acting suits this role right down to a T, and it's a wonder he didn't get an Oscar. Sharon Stone is in her element as well, portraying the typically heartless woman who dominates the world of Basic Instinct. George Dzundza lends the film a bit of heart, and Jeanne Tripplehorn makes a pretty good stripper, but in the end it is just a tour-de-force of lines that are supposed to turn you on but instead make you giggle, primarily between Michael and Sharon.It is somewhat a historical irony that the films Paul Verhoeven is best remembered for, this one and Showgirls being the best examples, are far from his best work. His best English-language pieces created a massive buzz around the time when they were released, but their lack of promotion or publicity since then, at least before the DVD releases, has ensured that you already have to be a fan of Verhoeven to be completely aware of them.All in all, I would recommend you give Basic Instinct a look if you're not too worried about the rantings of a man who needs serious therapy brought to life on screen. It's clear from the outset that none of the actors sympathise in any way with their characters, but that's partly what makes it all work. Just don't expect anything nearly as interesting as De Vierde Man.

So the basic notion of this film is that one or two women in this film are extremely manipulative and sexual creatures who will kill each other or so-called innocent third parties just for the sake of manipulation.It really comes as no surprise Paul Verhoeven would only work on one more film with Eszterhas, given that the latter can't seem to see women in general as anything other than whores, nymphs, deviants, punching bags, or general tools for the men to use. I only know of one Verhoeven film besides Basic Instinct and Showgirls where feminine characters are displayed in such an utterly negative light, and in that one, Starship Troopers, the characterisation is more based on actual events in the lives of army recruits than a pointless, disabling fear. Mankind may well be afraid of the unknown, but women have existed at least as long as men, which makes misogyny like this hard to take at all seriously.Then there's the plot twists. Granted, this would be an utterly boring thriller if the same suspect was actually the killer all the way through the film. The best way to look at the sequence of murders is to believe that different people killed each victim. It makes things a little easier to digest, since the final plot twist pretty much negates every other in the film unless you look at it in these broad terms. I think Eszterhas was just trying to be clever for a change instead of hateful.Michael Douglas is right in his element as the burned out detective who lives from day to day without really caring about his work. Michael's easy-going, apathetic style of acting suits this role right down to a T, and it's a wonder he didn't get an Oscar. Sharon Stone is in her element as well, portraying the typically heartless woman who dominates the world of Basic Instinct. George Dzundza lends the film a bit of heart, and Jeanne Tripplehorn makes a pretty good stripper, but in the end it is just a tour-de-force of lines that are supposed to turn you on but instead make you giggle, primarily between Michael and Sharon.It is somewhat a historical irony that the films Paul Verhoeven is best remembered for, this one and Showgirls being the best examples, are far from his best work. His best English-language pieces created a massive buzz around the time when they were released, but their lack of promotion or publicity since then, at least before the DVD releases, has ensured that you already have to be a fan of Verhoeven to be completely aware of them.All in all, I would recommend you give Basic Instinct a look if you're not too worried about the rantings of a man who needs serious therapy brought to life on screen. It's clear from the outset that none of the actors sympathise in any way with their characters, but that's partly what makes it all work. Just don't expect anything nearly as interesting as De Vierde Man.

If anyone thinks that the reason why John Travolta's career nosedived after Grease was merely because he chose some bad roles, I invite them to watch his performance in Sword Fish. The man has an ego the size of a small planet, and after his minor successes in films like Pulp Fiction and that even more abysmal flick where he was an angel, it has lost all restraint once again. Every time he's in frame, I half expected him to turn to the camera and say worship me, I am John Travolta.Then there is Vinnie Jones. Being a real heavy as opposed to an actor just playing a heavy, he looks so out of place in this effort that it isn't even funny. His usual don't-mess-with-me posture and moments of dialogue that even make me afraid of him are such a contrast to the posing of almost every other actor in this film that they make the usual American swagger even harder to tolerate. The bad acting in this film can't just be passed off as underwriting, either. Halle Berry proves in this display that she can only play Halle Berry. Her boobs give a better performance in the ninety-seven minutes of this film than the rest of her.Hugh Jackman is the other actor in this film who is credible in his role as a hacker. His ability to play desperate men doing desperate things to solve a desperate situation, and do so with credibility, is what saves this film's attempt to make operating a computer seem much more exciting than what it really is. He's also an excellent action hero, primarily because you can take him as seriously as you can take Vinnie Jones, the other action hero in the story. He's also able to give the film a heart and soul, with the depiction of his character's daughter and his relationship with her giving an easily believeable reason for the character to act the way he does. I suspect that Hugh is going to go far in Hollywood, just like Russell Crowe, who he is often unfairly compared with, is already doing for much the same reason.So, in a nuthsell, this film has annoying performances from Travolta and Berry, annoying camerawork, unrealistic depictions of a plot device, plus another outstanding performance from Hugh Jackman, plus another great cameo from Vinnie Jones.

Together, they delivered a touching pair of teenagers in love. Quite a tearjerker, too. The film, directed by John Stockwell, is beyond merely another teenage angst movie from Hollywood. This one has substance and takes on the teen problems and situations up front and centered without any qualms in baring harsh facts and angles. Yet there is heart and love - being the backbone to the situations presented - with Carlos standing by taking a simple honest look at the troubled Nicole, yes, love conquers all (and we don't care how cliché that may sound.) Carlos demonstrates his pure of heart approach overcoming the fear and dilemma Nicole's father, poignantly portrayed by Bruce Davison, was struggling with. It's Hollywood, but this is good Hollywood stuff - worthwhile movie to sit through and appreciate. The premise of a troubled teenage rich girl story in Mad Love 1995 with Drew Barrymore and Chris O'Donnell is superficial compared to this unexpectedly well-done Crazy\/Beautiful. Kirsten Dunst was outstanding in her debut film Interview with the Vampire 1994, at a tender age of 12 playing opposite Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise. In 1999, she stood out with her performances in Sofia Coppola's Virgin Suicides, The and in the fun satires Dick and Drop Dead Gorgeous. Last year she was the radiant cheerleading energy in Bring It On. A maturing young actor Dunst is becoming.I first remember the name Bruce Davison in signs of the time Strawberry Statement, The 1970.
