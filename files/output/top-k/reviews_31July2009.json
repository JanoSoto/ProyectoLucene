There isn't much action in this film and the storyline (even though not very good) is better in lines then in teleplay. Also Rose McGowen is annoying in this movie and once her character was dead i said inside THANK GOD.Scream 2 was neither good or bad, but still better than Scream 1. This movie is fit for theatres but the way the movie was written was not good enough.Scream 3 was the best. I guess the way the movie was written is very good. Also the truth about Sidney's mother in this movie is way darker and cooler then the other stories about Sidney's mother back in Scream 1.

Second, this is easily one of the silliest and illogical films in the series, and logic generally isn't the strong point of the series. I am not a big Friday fan in general, and have always regarded this very repetitive series as dreadfully overrated by some of my fellow Horror fans. While this fifth entry to the series is easily one of the worst Jason films, at least it isn't boring though.Although made in 1985, one year after the fourth part, The Final Chapter (right), A New Beginning is set 10 years after the events in the fourth part. The film takes place in an open mental institution that is supposed to help teenagers with psychological problems re-enter normal life. Tommy Jarvis (played by Corey Feldman as a kid, by John Shepard as an adult), the boy who brought Jason to his well-deserved end in the fourth part, is still suffering from the trauma caused by this fateful night. Soon after he enters the facility, a likable handicapped man is axe-murdered by a psychotic fellow resident (for the record - handicaps and mental disorders are not even remotely the same thing, so I wonder what the victim was doing there in the first place). After this grueling event, a copycat killer begins butchering people, imitating Jason's favorite butchering-techniques...Compared to other entries to the series, the murders in A New Beginning are quite gore-less; the camera almost always fades away from explicit detail, and shows merely the dead corpses AFTER the murders. As it is the case with some of the other Friday films, the slightest suspense is significantly lowered by annoying characters. This film is even more illogical and full of ridiculous moments and stupidities than most other Friday parts. Some stupid 'highlights' - An exaggeratedly stereotypical redneck lady living near the loony bin clearly hates the lunatics living there, even though her own nutjob son is obviously a lot weirder than any of the mental patients.- A guy who looks like Little Richard and his girlfriend are singing a duet while he is taking a crap (the lyrics of the song are Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby,...).- The buddy-like head of the institution gets worried when the residents stay out too long; however, he responds very lenient to spontaneous violent outbursts, and doesn't seem terribly touched when one of them gets killed.- A grandfather has no problem with his little grandson making a trip through the forest only with a hot young woman and a patient as company, when it is quite clear that a maniac is on the loose.- One of the residents, a chick with terrible makeup, spends most of her time doing a ridiculous robot-dance...All characters are annoying and painfully stereotypical, the (oh so funny) redneck family and the hysterical central character Tommy are particularly unbearable. From the beginning it is quite clear who the murderer is. The ambulance driver, who happens to be the deadbeat father of the butchered handicapped guy, looks terrified when he sees the corpse and obviously wanted to avenge his son by acting like Jason (?). It isn't clear why he would suddenly care after not taking care of his son for years, nor is it explained why he has an actual photo of his son and knows what he looks like after leaving him as a kid. Neither does it make a lot of sense that he would target everybody (including his dead son's friends, and random people who had nothing to do with his son's death) EXCEPT for the guy who killed the boy. Overall, A New Beginning is easily one of the stupidest Friday films, but it's not the most boring one. It actually somewhat entertaining in a (really) silly way. I would only recommend it to hardcore Friday-fans (I'm NOT one of them), and many of them will probably dislike this one due to the lack of Jason.

She's so innocent and spirited, like a child, in her own dreamland half the time but also one of the most uncompromising and exploratory artists\/musicians I can think of. Unique and powerful music (for me at least). At times almost hardcore I reckon; most of her music is far from fluffy or cute although she can certainly do that as well. Anyway, she carries a lot of the weight (?) of the film and it works very well. I guess everyone's beautiful but her character's sad\/lonely beauty stuck out for me.Anyway, what do I know? I find it surprising that anyone could dislike this movie (or Lars von Triers' style). The cinematography wasn't distracting or self-conscious at all for me. It effectively got you in there, intimate wid dem characters. Like a documentary. It doesn't generally seem to follow the rules of Hollywood (for example you can't tell how long shots (or gaps between spoken lines) will last)). It's more akin to real life. Natural and intuitive. No conscious rules.According to Ebert (and probably common sense), the plot isn't very appealing or realistic by itself. But who cares? In terms of performances, they're so natural. It doesn't seem like acting at all. A couple of moments I found quite shocking and all the shifts in pace just seemed right. Y'know, like tension builds up, emotions are running high, something suddenly happens, there's an adrenalin rush, time's starting to mess about, you make quick choices and might end up bringing out side of yourself that you didn't know existed, and then eventually it's over and you feel kind of blank, gradually the heart-rate lowers and the real world comes back into focus, you're lost for words, sort of frozen to the spot, no idea what to do next. For instance.Why do we watch movies? I don't know if this movie changed me but it had a deep effect on me. I don't know if I really learned anything. I certainly enjoyed observing various details (that seemed truthful and spontaneous because of the style), and just taking it all in. I loved the music. Worth seeing for the music alone if you ask me (but the style won't appeal to all). Plus, if you like anything a bit off-centre or dreamy or different, this is pretty much a must.Who isn't afraid of death? I liked how this movie sort of tackled the situation (facing death) pretty head-on. An average of, what, 3 deaths occur in the average movie? But when do they actually bring you to ponder it or really feel it? This one doesn't offer up any particular answers and its point is left open. You gotta bring it. But it follows through so determinedly that you can't avoid it. It's pretty scary, really. And unforgettable.Personally, I was reminded of times when I almost wish I didn't have any emotions. We didn't choose to be born and hence to potentially experience pain and\/or death. One could argue you become responsible for yourself soon enough but it still seems somehow unfair in certain ways. But I guess life can also be fun so it's balanced and we should just make the best of it and be grateful to have it at all. Perhaps the problem is people *do* shut off their emotions (due to fear (of death or illness or in general)) and that's why they become boring and eventually kick the bucket. Stupid generalising's a bad habit of mine...Back to the movie, I see it as quite an experience. In terms of escapism, it's very effective in taking you on a journey. Only partially is it a fantasy though (the songs). Otherwise it is very dramatic. I enjoy the dark intensity because I'm interested in acting, taking myself to emotional extremes and whatnot. Its sincere and the filmmakers come across as talented and experienced. It tackles some tough subjects. It laid down some pretty vivid memories for me.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Musical"},{"date":"31 July 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" One of the weirdest\/quirkiest and also most fascinating people on the Earth Bjork. Well, based on her work and interviews of course. She's so innocent and spirited, like a child, in her own dreamland half the time but also one of the most uncompromising and exploratory artists\/musicians I can think of. Unique and powerful music (for me at least). At times almost hardcore I reckon; most of her music is far from fluffy or cute although she can certainly do that as well. Anyway, she carries a lot of the weight (?) of the film and it works very well. I guess everyone's beautiful but her character's sad\/lonely beauty stuck out for me.Anyway, what do I know? I find it surprising that anyone could dislike this movie (or Lars von Triers' style). The cinematography wasn't distracting or self-conscious at all for me. It effectively got you in there, intimate wid dem characters. Like a documentary. It doesn't generally seem to follow the rules of Hollywood (for example you can't tell how long shots (or gaps between spoken lines) will last)). It's more akin to real life. Natural and intuitive. No conscious rules.According to Ebert (and probably common sense), the plot isn't very appealing or realistic by itself. But who cares? In terms of performances, they're so natural. It doesn't seem like acting at all. A couple of moments I found quite shocking and all the shifts in pace just seemed right. Y'know, like tension builds up, emotions are running high, something suddenly happens, there's an adrenalin rush, time's starting to mess about, you make quick choices and might end up bringing out side of yourself that you didn't know existed, and then eventually it's over and you feel kind of blank, gradually the heart-rate lowers and the real world comes back into focus, you're lost for words, sort of frozen to the spot, no idea what to do next. For instance.Why do we watch movies? I don't know if this movie changed me but it had a deep effect on me. I don't know if I really learned anything. I certainly enjoyed observing various details (that seemed truthful and spontaneous because of the style), and just taking it all in. I loved the music. Worth seeing for the music alone if you ask me (but the style won't appeal to all). Plus, if you like anything a bit off-centre or dreamy or different, this is pretty much a must.Who isn't afraid of death? I liked how this movie sort of tackled the situation (facing death) pretty head-on. An average of, what, 3 deaths occur in the average movie? But when do they actually bring you to ponder it or really feel it? This one doesn't offer up any particular answers and its point is left open. You gotta bring it. But it follows through so determinedly that you can't avoid it. It's pretty scary, really. And unforgettable.Personally, I was reminded of times when I almost wish I didn't have any emotions. We didn't choose to be born and hence to potentially experience pain and\/or death. One could argue you become responsible for yourself soon enough but it still seems somehow unfair in certain ways. But I guess life can also be fun so it's balanced and we should just make the best of it and be grateful to have it at all. Perhaps the problem is people *do* shut off their emotions (due to fear (of death or illness or in general)) and that's why they become boring and eventually kick the bucket. Stupid generalising's a bad habit of mine...Back to the movie, I see it as quite an experience. In terms of escapism, it's very effective in taking you on a journey. Only partially is it a fantasy though (the songs). Otherwise it is very dramatic. I enjoy the dark intensity because I'm interested in acting, taking myself to emotional extremes and whatnot. Its sincere and the filmmakers come across as talented and experienced. It tackles some tough subjects. It laid down some pretty vivid memories for me. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 (that I can think of) was that it is still comparatively artsy; it doesn't have the universal appeal that movies like The Dark Knight or The Godfather have. It doesn't really have their complexity or ingenuity either but it's got originality and power. And 'thas the stuff of life.

It's a film that generally speaking does not have a good reputation. The main reason for the bad attitude to this movie is clearly because the vast majority of people unsurprisingly go into this film with the expectation of seeing another Michael Myers romp, and evidently a lot of viewers aren't overly impressed by his absence here. Moreover, Halloween III is not even in the same sub-genre as the rest of the series, seeing as it is a sci-fi horror as opposed to slasher flick. In other words, if this film had been a standalone movie it would most probably be regarded as a fairly original little horror flick; it certainly would not have attracted nearly as much negativity. John Carpenter, the director of the first instalment, had the reasonably good idea of making each Halloween instalment a different standalone horror tale set on Halloween night. Unfortunately his grand plan was undermined by a rather silly flaw, in that the previous film, Halloween 2, was a continuation of the Michael Myers story, therefore, it was hardly surprising that the expectation would be that subsequent instalments followed this same formula in the manner of the likes of the Friday the 13th series. As a result, Season of the Witch was met with bemusement and the franchise reverted back to Myers mayhem for the remainder of the series.It's a shame that Halloween 3 wasn't released as a standalone movie called simply Season of the Witch because this is a quirky horror flick with a good amount of invention. Sure it's a bit silly in places, with a few plot holes (i.e. wouldn't the differing American time zones screw up the scheduling of Silver Shamrock's death-by-television extravaganza?) but it's odd enough to always remain interesting. I liked the spooky town that Silver Shamrock seemed to control, with ominous CCTV, odd inhabitants and sinister tannoy announcements. The suit-wearing bad guys were also a bit different to the typical psychotic villains, and I thought they were integrated well into the film. Acting-wise Dan O'Herlihy was very good as the evil chief mask-maker, while the rest of the cast was serviceable enough. The famous 'Happy Happy Halloween' theme song was used extensively but I liked it and felt it conveyed the feeling that something was not quite right with the Silver Shamrock promotional campaign.

Kids growing up from here on out watching Terminator 2 Judgement Day won't even have a sense of ground this film broke, and consequently their overall enjoyment of the film will be a bit less. I give this film 8\/10 when it's deserving of more in the right context -- these kids might go lower.But even the lowest of budgets can be better than a digital spectacle with a better story. T2 has that story, brilliantly taking its iconic villain, The Terminator (Schwarzenegger) from the first film, and bringing him back as a good guy. Genius. This time he is sent back in time to protect a 10-year-old John Connor (Edward Furlong), son of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) and leader of the humans in the future when the machines they create turn on them -- not kill him. That job is left to T-1000 (Robert Patrick), who is made of shape-shifting liquid metal. Today, that's nothing, but 20 years ago, T-1000 joined the ranks of Darth Vader on the villains list and there he still stays in the minds of many.Much like 1984's The Terminator, one guy from the future is good, the other bad, and both are engaged in the life of a human who is pivotal to the future. Wherever one goes, the other follows. The difference is that James Cameron has turned the weapons and explosives scale up to a 15 on a scale of 10. Hamilton, once an '80s party girl, is now an angry and muscular 35-year-old who goes crazy on people; Schwarzenegger's shotgun is now on the puny end of his arsenal.James Cameron wows with the action. It sort of erases his attempt to tell a story about the differences between humans and robots through the relationship between John and the Terminator, but just about everything with a motor or a computer chip in it meets some sort of spark-flying combustible end. Plus, it all looks better than the first. Cameron has much better models of Schwarzenegger to beat up and he weaves them in more cleverly. The make-up is also superior. Talk about a visual marvel for its time -- all the Oscars for various effects and make-up are certainly well- deserved. Cameron decides that an action movie about the future isn't worth making unless it breaks ground. It's hard to disagree with the man.The acting could still be better, but believe it or not, I don't mean Schwarzenegger. He's actually much better now that he's got the English thing down -- or at least intelligible.

Jim Henson created all the creatures and they're visually complex and wonderful. The sets are also marvellous, including the labyrinth, especially when see from above, and a sequence in a room with stairs that go up and down, and to the sides, like in the famous Escher painting.The story is solid and because of its simplicity there are few plot holes.

The Production Code of the 1930s kept husbands from sleeping in the same beds with their wives. Gangsters could live high on the hog, but they had to forfeit their lives in a blaze of gunfire at fade-out. And all movies had to feature heroines and villains. Movies still tell us how we should behave, especially if we want to be considered good. If you want to learn what constitutes appropriate social behavior in a Hollywood movie, consider the characters that receive rewards for good conduct and draw punishment for bad conduct. Lately, Hollywood's moral compass has gyrated. Nowhere has this moral compass gyrated more drastically than in the winsome Julia Roberts' comedy My Best Friend's Wedding, co-starring Dermot Mulroney and Cameron Diaz. Initially, My Best Friend's Wedding appears like just another chick flick, but Murial's Wedding director P.J. Hogan tweaks the formula for some innovative results. My Best Friends' Wedding easily qualifies as one of Julia's best roles. She plays the wicked wench who wants to steal her best friend Michael O'Neal (Dermot Mulroney of Young Guns) away for the woman Kimberly Wallace (Cameron Diaz of The Mask) whom he has vowed to marry.The premise in Waiting to Exhale scenarist Ronald Bass' screenplay is that Michael and Julianne (Julia Roberts of Mystic Pizza) have agree to marry each other if they have not made a trip to the altar by age twenty-eight. As the deadline approaches, Michael phones up Julianne. He surprises her with the news that he is going to exchange vows with a 20-year old heiress whose father owns the Chicago White Sox baseball team. Julianne is literally floored by this revelation. She has dreamed always that Michael and she will wed. Anyway, Michael also wants to Julianne to fly to Chicago and help him get through the wedding. Afire with incendiary jealousy, Julianne wings her way off to the Windy City fully prepared to fight for the man she loves. Then she encounters Kimberly. Cameron Diaz resembles a peachy Michelle Pfeiffer. She conjures up one of the most giddy, vulnerable, fresh-faced performances in seasons. Kimberly drives like a maniac through traffic. She begs Julianne to fill in for her Maid of Honor who broke her hip while line dancing. Overwhelmed, Julianne agrees. What the filmmakers cannot salvage in this shallow script, they more than compensate for with their comedy of errors routines and plot twists. In My Best Friend's Wedding, Julia Roberts resembles poor Wily E. Coyote in the Warner Brothers' Road Runner cartoons because everything that she does to sabotage Michael and Kimberly's plans ironically strengthens their love. It's fun to see Julia play the scheming bad girl. Usually, movie stars prefer to play roles that make them look idealized. As the villainess, Julie has more to work with here than if she were the bland heroine. She is the character who goes against the grain. In Hollywood movies, you must go with the grain and embrace status quo values to emerge triumphant. I won't spill the beans about how Julianne tries to wreck the wedding because it is one of the movie's brightest scenes. Roberts delivers another attractive but sympathetic performance. Mulroney seems rather wooden as Michael, while Diaz bubbles with both energy and sincerity. Veteran character actor M. Emmet Walsh of Blood Simple sheds his slime ball movie image to impersonate a lovable old uncle type. British actor Rupert Everett provides the movie's major plot twist; he is cast as Julianne's boss George Downes. George is a gay character! Hollywood movies before The Bird Cage usually treated gay characters as lepers. Rupert Everett, however, stands out as the movie's number one scene stealer! Witty, urbane, sartorial, and charismatic, he is neither swishy nor limp-wristed. George is the kind of gay character that Hollywood doesn't classify as queer. The filmmakers emphasize this point when George is presented as the sole character with any common sense in this comedy of errors. Suddenly, gays are winning kudos for acting like heterosexuals! George's advice to Julianne never goes awry, but Julianne does nothing but make one mistake after another. Hogan never lets the frivolity frizzle. My Best Friend's Wedding doesn't waste time, and Hogan knows when to toss in some erotic humor, such as the icy statue of David gag. Upbeat musical interludes always punctuate the film at the right moments. Indeed, My Best Friend's Wedding may be the most easily sung along with movie of the year. The scene in the karaoke bar and the seafood restaurant ripple with genuinely infectious good spirit.Shallow but frothy, My Best Friend's Wedding emerges as certainly more than an average chick flick. Hollywood has experienced the kind of attitude change that makes Wedding look ahead of its time. Rarely do major Hollywood films embrace homosexuals as charitably as My Best Friend's Wedding. Ultimately, My Best Friend's Wedding seems to say that it is okay to be gay, but that nobody has the right to interfere with a marriage that is made in Heaven. Moreover, as financially successful as My Best Friend's Wedding has been at the box office, could this mean that gay characters will be lining up as the new sidekicks for straight characters?

","genre":"Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"31 July 2009","score":"","review":" Hollywood movies have always dictated what constitutes model behavior. The Production Code of the 1930s kept husbands from sleeping in the same beds with their wives. Gangsters could live high on the hog, but they had to forfeit their lives in a blaze of gunfire at fade-out. And all movies had to feature heroines and villains. Movies still tell us how we should behave, especially if we want to be considered good. If you want to learn what constitutes appropriate social behavior in a Hollywood movie, consider the characters that receive rewards for good conduct and draw punishment for bad conduct. Lately, Hollywood's moral compass has gyrated. Nowhere has this moral compass gyrated more drastically than in the winsome Julia Roberts' comedy My Best Friend's Wedding, co-starring Dermot Mulroney and Cameron Diaz. Initially, My Best Friend's Wedding appears like just another chick flick, but Murial's Wedding director P.J. Hogan tweaks the formula for some innovative results. My Best Friends' Wedding easily qualifies as one of Julia's best roles. She plays the wicked wench who wants to steal her best friend Michael O'Neal (Dermot Mulroney of Young Guns) away for the woman Kimberly Wallace (Cameron Diaz of The Mask) whom he has vowed to marry.The premise in Waiting to Exhale scenarist Ronald Bass' screenplay is that Michael and Julianne (Julia Roberts of Mystic Pizza) have agree to marry each other if they have not made a trip to the altar by age twenty-eight. As the deadline approaches, Michael phones up Julianne. He surprises her with the news that he is going to exchange vows with a 20-year old heiress whose father owns the Chicago White Sox baseball team. Julianne is literally floored by this revelation. She has dreamed always that Michael and she will wed. Anyway, Michael also wants to Julianne to fly to Chicago and help him get through the wedding. Afire with incendiary jealousy, Julianne wings her way off to the Windy City fully prepared to fight for the man she loves. Then she encounters Kimberly. Cameron Diaz resembles a peachy Michelle Pfeiffer. She conjures up one of the most giddy, vulnerable, fresh-faced performances in seasons. Kimberly drives like a maniac through traffic. She begs Julianne to fill in for her Maid of Honor who broke her hip while line dancing. Overwhelmed, Julianne agrees. What the filmmakers cannot salvage in this shallow script, they more than compensate for with their comedy of errors routines and plot twists. In My Best Friend's Wedding, Julia Roberts resembles poor Wily E. Coyote in the Warner Brothers' Road Runner cartoons because everything that she does to sabotage Michael and Kimberly's plans ironically strengthens their love. It's fun to see Julia play the scheming bad girl. Usually, movie stars prefer to play roles that make them look idealized. As the villainess, Julie has more to work with here than if she were the bland heroine. She is the character who goes against the grain. In Hollywood movies, you must go with the grain and embrace status quo values to emerge triumphant. I won't spill the beans about how Julianne tries to wreck the wedding because it is one of the movie's brightest scenes. Roberts delivers another attractive but sympathetic performance.

That review stuck with me for some time, and was revived two years later as I went to the video store looking for something for my young brother (aged 11 at the time) to see in the weekend. To make a long story short I was the one that end up watching it, at 200 o'clock on a Sunday morning. And what a surprise! I didn't knew who Hayao Miyazaki was, but I certainly got to Know him from that point on! The story is set in a fantasy like Japan, where the groundbreaking molding of iron was disputed by several feudal lords (and the emperor itself), and the forests were ruled by spirits and gods in the form of giant animal-beasts! In deed the first ten minutes of the movie are presented to us in over drive, as a former god turned demon rages in to the peaceful village of the Emishi tribe, leaving it to its prince, Ashitaka, to defend it . And so the movie gets started!In all of his previous movies Miyazaki had already presented us with the classical duel of Human versus Nature which is in the center stage here. The whole movie can be seen as a huge metaphor, exploring that very same theme, with characters depicting each side of the conflict_ Lady Eboshi and San _ that are everything but one dimensional characters, and can't be labeled as good or bad, as if Miyazaki is inviting us to make our own judgment about them; and of course there is Ashitaka, a fated prince that in his own search for peace of mind ends up being the leverage that tries to bring each side to a peaceful existence. In the end you are left in absolute awe, and questioning yourself how could such a masterpiece ever got to the finish line in one piece! Could it be the story and script on which Miyazaki labored for so long (story has it that he started developing the characters as far as thirteen years prior to the movie)? Is it the top notch cell animation technique, or the beautiful color with which the sceneries are depicted?

The movie is framed as a story that a grandfather reads to his sick grandson and it's a perfect idea for a movie that has some tongue-in-cheek takes on fantasy clichés.The story begins with Buttercup (Robin Wright Penn) and Westley (Cary Elwes), two farmers who fall in love. He decides to leave and return one day a rich man to marry her. Then she hears he was killed by a pirate and Prince Humperdinck decides to make her his bride. But when they least expect Westley returns for 'true love' and the story turns into one of the funniest and most fast-paced adventure ever. There are deadly eels, giant rodents, dangerous forests, giants, revenge-obsessed swordsmen, and miracles. The heroes are noble and fair, and the villains despicable. And true love wins in the end. A movie has never been more honest about its intentions than The Princess Bride.The cast is mostly great, especially Cary Elwes and Mandy Patinkin, a swordsman looking for the man who killed his father. Penn could have been a more interesting character than the usual damsel in distress, but I guess some clichés you just don't touch. Peter Falk has a short but adorable role as the grandfather trying to pass to his grandson some of the pleasure of reading books.The Princess Bride is a wonderful story that should appeal to anyone who never lost their sense of wonder and who still like to see the good guys truly win without compromises, something rare these days in mainstream cinema.

If you are familiar with the television series you will be familiar with the crude style of the animation, although if you have only seen the later episodes this may seem cruder.The film starts with the four boys going to the cinema to watch the Terrance and Philip movie, an R-rated film from Canada. Unlike their television programme their film is full of swearing and when the boys come out they are all swearing like troopers. Soon all the children in South Park seem to have seen it and are swearing in class. When their mother's are told Kyle's mother decides that something must be done and that something is to arrest Terrance and Philip and begin hostilities against Canada. While this is going on Kenny has more serious problems; after copying a stunt from the film he dies and ends up in Hell where he learns that if the US goes ahead with its plans to execute Terrance and Philip Satan and his gay lover, Saddam Hussein, will take over the world.Unlike the television series this film is a musical; the songs are actually rather good, not just the comedy lyrics, they have good tunes too. The comedy isn't only crude it is also a fairly biting satire about censorship in the US where a few naughty words are considered more offensive than acts of violence. I'd recommend this film to any adult who isn't easily offended and likes a good laugh, just don't assume that because it is animated it must be suitable for children; Disney this is not.
