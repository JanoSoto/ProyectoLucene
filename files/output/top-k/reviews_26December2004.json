Though it has a rather undeveloped story, the movie is backed by a phenomenal share of performers and spattered with moments of comic relief.This is the story of four men who hijack a New York subway car (Pelham 123). While their motives are never really explained, their demands are simple one million dollars in exchange for the eighteen passengers being held hostage. Where the idiotic mayor (with a striking resemblance to former New York mayor, Ed Koch) fails to respond to the emergency, the Lueteneit of the New York Transit Authority (Walter Matthau) prepares to negotiate with the men and save as many of the hostages as possible. This is no easy task of course, given the unrelenting leader of of the gang of four, Mr. Blue (yes, this serves as the precedent for Tarrantino's 'Resevoir Dogs,' as do many things in 1970s cinema), played by Robert Shaw, who seems to command the show, making seemingly impossible demands on the authorities. The movie does well with maintaining the pace throughout the picture, with the tension being broken moments of comic relief. Although, the story remains somewhat undeveloped, since we never really find out why the hijackers have chosen to take over the train. Other than Robert Shaw's character, the hijackers are men of few words.However, in spite of this, the movie is still entertaining, due in large part to a terrific cast of acting veterans and regulars, including Marty Balsam, Hector Elizando, and Earl Hindmen (Wilson on TV's 'Home Improvement') who portray the hijackers, and Jerry Stiller, James Broderick, and many other familiar faces serving as Matthau's support team.Overall, I would recommend seeing this movie, if you're able to find it. Unfortunately, since Hollywood never has any original ideas anymore, 'The Taking of Pelham One Two Three' was remade as a made-for-TV movie in 1998. For maximum enjoyment, catch it in its original form. The cast alone is reason enough to watch it.

So far of what I have seen in regard to films with Angelina Jolie, Whoopie Goldberg, Winona Ryder, and Brittany Murphy, who are the four actresses I found to be the most impressive, the roles they inhabited in this film were singularly sublime. When I think of these women, having not had the privilege of meeting them, and only their movies from which to observe them, I feel that their own personalities and characters are uncannily suited to the women they portray in the film itself. The casting director alone should be applauded for his or her efforts in assembling such an extraordinary group. In always choosing to keep my comments short and brief I will finish with a few points of good and bad commentary because those portions I found to be the most highlighting will give you, the viewer, an uncompromising outlook. The film, from what I could envision after having it ruminate in my mind for only a day, seemed to try to empower women, not through extreme political opposition or supposed enlightened ideologies, but through living out their lives as normal individuals. Goldberg's aggressive expression of psychology in a humanitarian wrapper as she responds to Ryder's character's pampered pouting after Lisa (Jolie) leaves the institution and Ryder is dropped into the bathtub, is the climactic turning point for this movie's righteous success, and a non-threatening addition to this movie's estrogen-charged atmosphere. Anyone who thinks this movie resembles One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest needs to have their eyes and ears checked because besides the fact that a majority of the story takes place in a mental institution it is absolutely and completely different in every imaginable aspect.

Almost immediately, the eldest daughter (former ice-skater Lynn-Holly Johnson) experiences weird visions linked to the disappearance of a teenage girl under mysterious circumstances many years before. The film has visual style to burn (cinematography and set design are especially eye-catching), and there's a couple of terrific PG-level scares, but all the technical gloss in the world can't make up for a listless pace and repetitious plot line, and Johnson's one-note performance transforms a strong, resourceful heroine into little more than a whining goody two-shoes. Worse still, co-stars Bette Davis, Carroll Baker and David McCallum are given almost nothing to do, and there's much evidence of editorial tampering during some of the opening scenes.Originally slated to conclude with an ambitious visual effects sequence, the version which premiered in 1980 was basically unfinished and led to scornful reviews which doomed it from the outset. Realizing their mistake, Disney pulled the film and reworked the ending, without the participation of several key personnel (including director John Hough!), most of whom had moved on to other projects. This revised print - running 16 minutes shorter than the 100m original - made it into theaters the following year, sporting a 1981 copyright, and is the version which has prevailed ever since. For a detailed report on Watchers troubled production history, see Paul Talbot's superb article in 'Video Watchdog' 88.

Almost immediately, the eldest daughter (former ice-skater Lynn-Holly Johnson) experiences weird visions linked to the disappearance of a teenage girl under mysterious circumstances many years before. The film has visual style to burn (cinematography and set design are especially eye-catching), and there's a couple of terrific PG-level scares, but all the technical gloss in the world can't make up for a listless pace and repetitious plot line, and Johnson's one-note performance transforms a strong, resourceful heroine into little more than a whining goody two-shoes. Worse still, co-stars Bette Davis, Carroll Baker and David McCallum are given almost nothing to do, and there's much evidence of editorial tampering during some of the opening scenes.Originally slated to conclude with an ambitious visual effects sequence, the version which premiered in 1980 was basically unfinished and led to scornful reviews which doomed it from the outset. Realizing their mistake, Disney pulled the film and reworked the ending, without the participation of several key personnel (including director John Hough!), most of whom had moved on to other projects.
