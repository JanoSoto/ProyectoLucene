Prizzi's Honor was kind of a coda to his career having directing his father Walter for Best Supporting Actor for The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre in 1948, in 1945 daughter Anjelica Huston wins for Best Supporting Actress in Prizzi's Honor. That's a feat that will really be hard for any director to duplicate.The Prizzis are your Eighties version of the Corleones, a Mafia family headquartered in Brooklyn with far reaching interests including Las Vegas like the Corleones. Jack Nicholson is Charlie Partanna, not the most polished knife in the drawer, but one of the sharpest. Mafia families inbreed more than royalty or hillbillies and Charlie's expected to marry Maerose Prizzi who is played by Anjelica Huston, the ultimate Mafia princess. He's practically been raised to be her prince consort.But one look at the beautiful and sophisticated Kathleen Turner and Nicholson's hormones are at light-speed overdrive. But Kathleen's got a secret or two as well. She was in on a scam that took $720.000.00 from the Prizzis in Las Vegas. And in a real bow to women's liberation, something indeed from a tradition bound organization like the Mafia, she's also a hit woman with a contract on Nicholson.Some 20 years before those marrieds Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie were trying to bed and kill each other simultaneously in Mr.&Mrs. Smith, Nicholson and Turner were going at it, tongue and gun. John Huston after 30 years finally repeated a black comedy, a much better black comedy than Beat The Devil.Besides Anjelica's win, Prizzi's Honor was up for several more Oscars in 1985 including Best Picture, Best Actor for Jack Nicholson, Best Supporting Actor for William Hickey, Best Director for John Huston and others. Prizzi's Honor is the kind of film where the jokes sneak up on you, don't expect belly laughs, but minutes after something is said, the line will kick in.And Prizzi's Honor was a great film to have to your credit in the twilight of your career for John Huston.

This may have something to do with the fact that i was 10 years old and loved Arnold Schwarzenegger action movies. I watched it again when i was 17 and i was blown away by the beauty (and tragedy) of the movie.I can understand why everyone does not enjoy Godfather. It is quite slow paced and does not necessarily appeal to a viewer who is used to gangster movies with lot of action in them, movies with 'dramatic' Hollywood soundtrack and movies that have quick 'dramatic' plot twists.First of all, you must remember that this is is not a gangster movie. This is a movie about family. This is movie about responsibilities. So if you are waiting to see Scarface then you are in for a big disappointment.Best part of the movie is the story. Movie tells us tale of the youngest son of the American-Sicilian mafia family. Tale of the son who has decided to live his life by the laws of the united states and not have anything to do with businesses of his family. But through the tragedy that brings the whole family together, son is little by little drawn back to illegal side of family. Finally son becomes what he did not want to be. What he despised. Because of the responsibilities to the family he forgets his ambitions and plans and becomes the Godfather.Coppola has really got the best performance out of the actors in this movie. Every emotion of Michael and other characters is forwarded to viewer. Special mention to the cast of this movie. I have not seen a movie with better casting. Cinematography of the movie may be a little out of date but it still is really really beautiful. Especially beautiful sets in Sicily deserve a mention. Nino Rota's soundtrack supports the drama of the movie in a way that I can hardly think of the soundtrack that does this better.All in all, i love this movie. If you combine first two films, you get the classical story of man changing to what he does not want to be. Classical story about rise and the fall of the man who turns from kind and loving person to ambitious, greedy and paranoid leader who pushes all his loved ones away. Story not too far from another one of the greatest movies of all time. Story not too far from Citizen Kane.And oh yes. I will dance Speak softly love in my wedding next august.

Despite respectable notices, reasonable box office and an Oscar nom, it vanished shortly afterwards and remained forgotten about throughout the 1980's, before being enthusiastically reappraised, somewhat unjustly, in the US in the late 90's. Thanks to this lengthy unavailability, its reputation has gone on to see it placed (inexplicably) alongside the likes of Michael Winner's original Death Wish. Although revenge is a theme, a film about vigilantism this most definitely is not.The plot isn't worth synopsizing. Its a flabby, hammy and bizarrely stagey ramble about an accidental murder and the unlikely relationship that blossoms out of it. That relationship and the largely class-based quirks of its two leads are exaggerated into ridiculous caricature; these two, and their situation, bear absolutely no relation to reality.Almost everything about the film is cantankerous and begrudgingly antiquated, which makes the whole thing completely fascinating. Hippies are depicted as snide and exclusive misanthropes, hard drugs either make you sleep or dance around maniacally with lipstick on your face, and most young women are prepared to have sex with strangers in exchange for marijuana at the drop of a fly. Its very much a film of the 60's rather than the 70's, so why some industry luminaries have begun to include it in retrospective conversations about the beginnings of the Hollywood New Wave is a complete mystery. Martin Scorcese of all people even got involved, though probably only to give a nod to the dank, lavatorial hues of the grim urban cinematography, which almost certainly influenced Taxi Driver four years later. But Joe seems very much like a furious tirade against the likes of Easy Rider and Bonnie And Clyde, rather than a continuation of that same insurgent cinematic ethos.It isn't a film of any real artistic significance - despite Joe's incontinent fury at everything in his world, it remains a story about absolutely nothing - but its value as a cultural museum piece is unprecedented. Shot on and around the streets of New York City during the darkest hours of the Vietnam war, and at a time when America (and, significantly, its cinema) was being revolutionized to the horror of the old guard, the film ends up, in its own completely oblivious and accidental way, saying more about that period of history than numerous infinitely superior movies that directly endeavored to capture it.But as a film? Despite a really surprising and effective shock ending, this is basically a Michael Winner film, but not as well made.

His timing and bizarre rough language fails to interest and importantly fails to entertain, which destroys the whole appeal of the film. Based around Miles from the get go, he is left out of about 5 scenes and with this terrible character who thinks he is 'it' and simply beats hard working professionals makes this worse than sitting on a cactus.The plot, as if not obvious enough already, follows Miles on a hunt to track down the diamond and to do that he must become a good guy (his comic 'appeal' make him feel like a good guy anyway) The movie is consistently awful with its poor central character, bad humour and exceptionally weak portrayal of cops.The humour from other characters could possibly have saved it, if they were interesting, funny and actual people with personalities.The representation of the force is egregious, a typical bunch of cops who haven't got a clue, eat donuts and can't drive properly, unless they are taught how by an idiotic character who is brand new to the team.It is hard to believe the interesting funny guy from Bad Boys leads the way in this picture.

Based around Miles from the get go, he is left out of about 5 scenes and with this terrible character who thinks he is 'it' and simply beats hard working professionals makes this worse than sitting on a cactus.The plot, as if not obvious enough already, follows Miles on a hunt to track down the diamond and to do that he must become a good guy (his comic 'appeal' make him feel like a good guy anyway) The movie is consistently awful with its poor central character, bad humour and exceptionally weak portrayal of cops.The humour from other characters could possibly have saved it, if they were interesting, funny and actual people with personalities.The representation of the force is egregious, a typical bunch of cops who haven't got a clue, eat donuts and can't drive properly, unless they are taught how by an idiotic character who is brand new to the team.It is hard to believe the interesting funny guy from Bad Boys leads the way in this picture. Blue Streak is a shocking excuse for a crime comedy with predictability written on the cover, awful representations and stereotypes.

Soon the group of men begin to struggle as the sand storms and lack of water begin to have a toll on them so they decide to give their lives and battle a large number of German's. This is certainly one of the better WW2 dramas out there and I guess it's what you'd call a man's movie since there isn't a single woman in the film. The movie works so well because of the wonderful cast who turn in some great and memorable performances. Bogart leads the way and turns in another winning performance but I'd stop short of calling it amongst his best. He certainly fits that tough guy role better than anyone in history so there's no problem believing anything his character is doing. The supporting cast is where the real greatness is as several members are able to outshine Bogie. J. Carrol Naish gives one of his greatest performances with a spot on Italian accent. It's a real shame so many people just remember Naish from his later day exploitation titles because he was certainly one of the better character actors from this era. Lloyd Bridges, Rex Ingram, Bruce Bennett and Richard Nugent also add great support. Guy Kingsford also should receive special attention as Stegman. I think the best part of the movie is the first sixty-minutes or so where the men are having to deal with the desert as their main enemy. The effects of them dealing with a sand storm was very well done as was a terrific scene where the men get to taste water for the first time in days. I think the later part of the story gets a tad bit far fetched but one should also keep in mind that movies like this were being made to make those watching them feel proud of the troops battling in the real war.

Because of its age, it's pretty much inevitable that it would be hyped up to oblivion by all the self-proclaimed film experts, but that's to be understood. When you're at a formal dinner, sipping fine wine, saying 300 is your favorite movie is going to get you awkwardly stared in the same way a kindergartener would get stared at if he said he was wearing underwear with Isaac Newton on them, not Dora the Explorer (or whatever kids watch these days). In that situation, it's best to say something from the 70s because, by God, every movie from the 70s is gold and everything from the 2000s is crap. It's understandable. But what I don't understand is how Deliverance can be so acclaimed within the casual crowd. I simply can't picture either a teenage kid listening to screamo or a middle aged man who's cheating on his wife finding enjoyment in Deliverance. It's the positive reviews from those people that disturb me. In fact, I'm going as far as to say the amount of positive reviews from the casual crowd disturbs me infinitely beyond that of the supposed brutal content of this movie.I'm a sap for slow-build movies. If you can grab my attention with a slow, atmospheric buildup, I'll be just as interested as if you bashed me in the balls with a god-awesome action scene. Deliverance knows how to do an effective slow build flawlessly. For the first hour I so interested in Deliverance I thought to myself This movie could do absolutely nothing to earn a bad score. Nothing. The buildup involved very well shot scenes of extreme canoeing, and the naturalist part of my mind was ready to have an orgasm from the awesomeness. (Okay, okay. Maybe I'm exaggerating a little for the melodramatic effect of my next sentence.) So there I am, on the edge of nirvana, and&#151;BOOM!&#151;out of nowhere the cliché conflict hits the plot and every good thing I had to say about this film went to hell. Not because the conflict was disturbing or gave me, the viewer, the feeling of desperation, but because it was so cliché. As I said, the movie is about nothing but four guys going canoeing who would have guessed something bad is going to happen to them? Really? As if I didn't see that coming. I just wish for once a movie would be realistic or edgy enough to have NOTHING bad happen to the characters. At least then it wouldn't be so ungodly predictable. You say, But if that happened, then there wouldn't be a plot! And you'd be right. But you're forgetting one small detail Deliverance had no plot to begin with. Four guys go canoeing and something bad happens . . . is as much of a plot as, Four guys go to Wal-Mart and they can't find the brand of toothpaste they wanted . . . So how can you argue with me when I say Deliverance would have been better if it had just stuck with the buildup, rather than add some cliché bad situation into the mix? At least that way it would have at least had entertainment value, and sacrificed nothing the actual movie has now except a few clichés.Without spoiling anything, the oh-so-bad events that happen aren't even that bad. The scene that seems to upset everyone was really almost comical. I actually laughed. The bad events all generic for 70s films. You've seen one 70s walking-down-the-street-and-then-bad-stuff-happens film, you've seen them all. They do nothing but copy Straw Dogs or A Clockwork Orange, or copy each other, and then they get acclaimed for being so original. It's ludicrous. There is nothing original about Deliverance, nor is there anything disturbing about it. It's typical in every single aspect. And if there is a moral point, I missed it because it was so cliché I couldn't tell it apart from the countless other clichés. What is the point of watching a movie for the moral point if it has no impact on your life or how you think? The only sole good thing I can even say about Deliverance is that it does have some very good directing scattered throughout. There are one or two scenes that are really some of the most effective nature shots in cinema history. But they last a whopping 20 seconds, and then the movie is back to its boring clichés and predictable story, so they're not worth watching the film for.Really, there isn't anything in Deliverance that makes it worth watching whatsoever. I've seen countless reviews use the term this film insults my intelligence because of some plot twist they were too dumb to see coming in modern movies. But here I am to use it against them Deliverance insulted its own intelligence. It started off with perfection, then it collapsed in on itself because the director thought he needed to insert some cliché plot\/moral to be literary.

I do recommend this to anyone who loves Jim Carey, 90's, and great twist. This movie also includes an outstanding cast that we still see today such as Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller. This movie is just too awesome, I don't know why the critics didn't like it, but this movie just was not marketed well like it should have. Everyone in the movie was outstanding and I just wish this movie got more because it was very good and 90's. Just watch the movie, you might not like the humor but you will love the story and movie!

I understand that there's debate on the accuracy of the film, both in terms of Helfgott's background and his piano playing skill. Knowing nothing of his background and little of the skills needed to play the piano, I'll choose to avoid the controversy and deal simply with the movie. It started off very strongly. The first half offered a powerful exploration of Helfgott's childhood, at the hands of a domineering father as well as a look at the early indications of both his abilities as a pianist and the first hints of mental illness. It was a little bit slow paced, but interesting nonetheless. Something happened, though, at the point at which David seemed to go truly insane after his Rachmaninoff recital. The movie itself seemed to lose its focus at that point, and it became what seemed to me to be a largely unconnected series of events offering a taste (but not much more) of Helfgott's later life in a rush, which was far less interesting than the first half. Geoffrey Rush was truly excellent as Helfgott, as was Alex Rafalowicz, who played Helfgott as a child. I was also impressed with Armin Mueller-Stahl's performance as Helfgott's father. The character of Gillian (played by Lynn Redgrave, who became Helfgott's wife) seemed to be introduced far too quickly, and I had no idea how they ended up suddenly married. Redgrave did well with the part, but there was little substance to the character. As far as I recall, there was also no mention of the fact that Helfgott had been previously married.The comparatively weaker second half pulled this down a fair bit in my estimation.

For those who are fans of Brian DePalma's film it's no more accurate than the famous Untouchable series in the Fifties or its counterpart in the Nineties.The plain truth is that Eliot Ness's operations against Al Capone's liquor supply did hurt him economically somewhat, but hardly slowed down his operation in Chicago. As for the income tax conviction that eventually did land Capone in Alcatraz, it was accomplished by the hard working accountants in US Attorney George W. Johnson's office. In the film that is the Clifton James character and Ness and his squad did work for him, but Charles Martin Smith's character would not have been an Untouchable.Whatever else Ness was, he was a master of generating good publicity for his work, the same way J.

That is in fact, part of a good crime fighter's job, the more people know of your successful good work, the more cooperation you get from the public. When Ness who went on to become the Chief of Police in Cleveland and then unsuccessful Republican candidate for Mayor of same, his career and finances took a nose dive.

Kevin Costner is your basic good guy and Robert DeNiro joins a great list of actors like Rod Steiger, Neville Brand, and Jason Robards, Jr. in interpreting the volatile crime boss of Chicago who has come down in legend himself.Costner's a Boy Scout in this business and as Sean Connery says to him, those kind of rules are out the window in dealing with people like Al Capone. His bit of philosophy given to Costner when Costner recruits him for The Untouchables is the title of the review. Connery plays an honest patrolman of Irish descent who hates dishonesty, but also don't think a little prejudice against the Italian Capone isn't involved in his thinking as well. Jimmy Malone is a broad and expansive part that Sean Connery can work wonders with.To be honest I don't think The Untouchables is Connery's best work, one friend has told me The Name of The Rose is his favorite, another has said Woman Of Straw is his favorite. My personal favorite among Sean Connery's performances is the incredibly neglected The Molly Maguires.

That it's far from the real Frank Nitti and that Nitti did not end the way Drago does in the film is irrelevant.

Anyone having to suffer through a Pan & Scan version of this would certainly be missing a lot because this is one of the most beautiful animated films I've ever seen. I heard this was the most expensive Disney movie in its time and that's easy to see because of how much is on the screen. I'm really not sure where to start in terms of the animation and colors but I guess a good place would be when two of the fairies are fighting over what color the dress should be. The pink and blue colors are flying back and forth and the beauty of this really caught my eye. Another great sequence in terms of animation is the ending where the prince must battle the dragon. What really sticks out as well are all the wonderful characters and this includes pretty much everyone that shows up on the screen.

I'm pretty sure I had seen parts of this when I was a kid but never the full thing until the recently released Blu-ray, which features the film in its 2.551 glory with a terrific transfer. Anyone having to suffer through a Pan & Scan version of this would certainly be missing a lot because this is one of the most beautiful animated films I've ever seen. I heard this was the most expensive Disney movie in its time and that's easy to see because of how much is on the screen. I'm really not sure where to start in terms of the animation and colors but I guess a good place would be when two of the fairies are fighting over what color the dress should be. The pink and blue colors are flying back and forth and the beauty of this really caught my eye. Another great sequence in terms of animation is the ending where the prince must battle the dragon. What really sticks out as well are all the wonderful characters and this includes pretty much everyone that shows up on the screen. Not only are the main characters very memorable but so are all the supporting ones. Even the animals who just have one sequence stand out with their charm. The parents of the prince and princess are wonderful as well and there's certainly nothing more charming than the three good fairies. I'm not sure if a stronger or more complicated story would have helped or not but I'm going to guess no because the simple nature of the film is something that makes this very charming.

It should have been a contender - Robert Mitchum had been ideally cast as Philip Marlowe in 1975's Farewell, My Lovely and he is surrounded here by some high calibre talent. But British director Michael Winner so messes up the script, the direction and the mis-en-scene that the film is the very definition of poor. At times it looks as though someone has conned a load of old actors into performing in their home movie shoot. Perhaps this film is a joke on the cast, many of whom were old enough to be heading for the big sleep themselves and so were the butt of Winner's sick joke.Mitchum walks through the film without shaming himself too much (although he shouldn't run or fight at this age); some of the other actors give the worst performances of their career James Stewart is beyond self-parody as the dying General; Sarah Miles lolls her tongue whilst sporting an afro perm (!), Richard Boon grimaces and growls to entirely comic effect and Candy Clark does the kind of acting one expects to see in an early John Waters film - a kind of mickey-take of acting - which is funny when Waters' cast does it deliberately but embarrassing when Clark (a promising actress previously) does it for supposedly serious effect here. A couple of the English actors, such as Richard Todd and John Mills, acquit themselves with dignity, although Edward Fox is hilariously bad in his scenes, plummy accent chewing words to pulp. Any film where Joan Collins gives one of the most convincing performances has got to be going wrong somewhere...Winner's script is a dog's dinner. He sets up the expectation that he's going to follow the convention whereby we only see and find out what Marlowe sees and finds out (a staple of detective films) and then adds random cutaways to events which Marlowe was not present at - e.g. the car going into the Thames - as well as plonking a lot of mismanaged flashbacks into the action every time anyone begins to talk about what has happened in the backstory. As usual with Winner, the film is cut with the finnesse of a village butcher, and setting the grimy noir in the posher areas of London and the English countryside does nothing to conjure the seamy world of the book.All in all, a pretty dismal addition to the list of Chandler adaptations, but worth seeing for the unintentional laughs (there are plenty) and as a lesson in how not to make a film, or what parts not to choose when you're an ageing actor.

After the two come into some money they decide to try their luck at gold searching with the help of a veteran (Walter Huston). Huston picked up an Oscar for his direction as well as the screenplay, which to me is the key to the success of this film. To me this film has one of the greatest and richest screenplays in film history and that's why this thing turned out to be the masterpiece that it is. I guess it shouldn't come as a shock to read that the film wasn't a success when originally released and that's certainly understandable as I'm sure many people didn't want to see an ugly picture about ugly characters. The whole notion of the story is that greed is evil and gold can turn any man to do bad things. None of this is truer than when it comes to the character of Fred C. Dobbs, the Bogart character. Bogart deserves a lot of credit for being willing to jump out of his safe and comfortable roles and do something quite challenging. There are countless scenes that could have embarrassed the actor but he nails everything so perfectly that you can't help but think of this when discussing his greatest works. The screenplay allows his character to grow, or fall apart if you will, so richly that Bogart perfectly soaks up the craziness that befalls his character as the gold begins to add up. Walter Huston rightfully won an Oscar for his performance, which is among the richest of his career. There isn't a single second in the film where you think you're seeing an actor because Huston is so believable in the role that you don't for a second believe him as a real prospector knowing every step of the game. Holt never did become a huge star, which is a shame because he too delivers an excellent performance. As great as Huston and Holt are there's no denying that the film belongs to Bogart. But once again the brilliant and complete screenplay is where a lot of the credit must go because it doesn't shy away from the dark and ugly nature of man. Huston does a wonderful job in his direction because he holds the three characters together even as they each start to gain and lose portions of their mind, faith and reasons for being on the journey. In the end this remains one of the greatest American movies ever made and its riches are a lot more valuable than the gold the three characters are so desperately searching for.

You see Frank has a big problem with women & resents them so he kills them, simple. Besides killing them he scalps them & places the scalp on a store window mannequin inside his apartment & he has amassed quite a collection. He then falls for sexy photographer Anna D'Antoni (Caroline Munro) but the fact that he is a brutal serial killer of women is sure to cause problems in the relationship eventually...This notorious 80's sleazy gore flick was directed by William Lustig (surely the man who has directed the most films with the word 'Maniac' in the title since he also directed all the Maniac Cop trilogy) who has a small cameo at the start as he plays the hotel manager & if we are all totally honest Maniac would be virtually unknown & almost certainly have disappeared into obscurity if it were not for the aforementioned gory & sometimes disturbing special make-up effects courtesy of the main man Tom Savini who also plays the dude who gets his head blown off to save having to mould another fake head presumably since Savini had a fake head of himself lying around anyway. Maniac was a difficult film for me to rate & judge & I am still not sure whether I should give it a six or seven out of ten, on the one hand you have one of the most threadbare films I have ever seen with virtually no plot whatsoever yet it's undeniably effective & those gore effects are just terrific if your into that sort of thing which I am. There are no character's beyond Frank & Anna who barely features anyway, Frank has the whole Psycho (1960) thing going on as he has been left mentally scared by his late abusive Mother just like Norman Bates & as such has a misogynistic attitude towards women & likes to kill & scalp them in his spare time. That's the whole plot. Seriously beyond a shallow relationship between Frank & Anna & his killing if women nothing else happens in Maniac, nothing. At just under 90 odd minutes the pace is alright, there's enough gore & horror to satisfy the exploitation crowd & it is oddly watchable but when all said & done there's just not enough to it to justify 90 minutes of most people's time.The film definitely has a sleazy, seedy feel & atmosphere to it, those graffiti covered toilets in that New York subway are enough to give anyone nightmares. I wouldn't have liked to take a crap in one of those late at night that's for sure! The whole 80's New York feel is there too which adds a lot & it is generally well made although a bit basic. The one real stand-out feature of Maniac has to be the gore effects, from scalping's to slit throats, from sliced throats to stabbings, from chopped off arms to heads being pulled off & the infamous scene in which a guy has his head blown off from point blank range by a shotgun. Good stuff & the effects by Savini are up to his usual high standards. There's a tight, claustrophobic atmosphere to the film & it can be unsettling at times, the surprisingly suspenseful chase through the subway as Frank stalks the nurse is particularly well shot & put together in this regard.Apparently shot on a low $350,000 budget the real life New York locations really help sell the film, the production values are alright if basic & the special make-up effects are better than perhaps the film deserves. Also to keep costs down several porn actresses were hired to play the female roles rather than proper actor's. The acting is pretty good actually, again maybe better than the film deserves. I think Caroline Munro was cast after her husband put some money into the film & adds a touch of English glamour I suppose.Maniac is a film that doesn't sound too promising as it's merely a collection of women being killed by some fat guy but it has a certain compelling atmosphere & the memorable gore effects really are showstoppers at times.

At feeding time wouldn't we rather be the snake than the mouse? Even though we might be revolted by the snake's single-minded swallowing, without benefit of a knife and fork, don't we merely shiver a bit and keep watching? Tom Ripley enjoys a good meal, too. He wants all the good things in life. He doesn't mind causing a little death now and then to get them and to keep them. He takes exception to being looked down upon. Along with Ripley's charm, good nature, easy manners and handsome looks, he has a complete lack of conscience, which combines well with his desire to enjoy what others have. Patricia Highsmith's intelligent thriller, The Talented Mr. Ripley, first introduced us to Tom. He was poor then but willing to be rich. He was the order-taking, money-holding, envious hanger-on to an over-bearing, arrogant rich young man about his own age. The death of this man, plus a spot of impersonation and forgery, some quick thinking and resourcefulness, put Tom on his path to riches. Of course, it was Tom who did the deed to his friend. Forty minutes into Plein Soleil and Tom Ripley is on his way. Rene Clement's Plein Soleil (Purple Noon), with an incredibly young and handsome Alain Delon as Tom Ripley, was the first filming of Tom's murderous and successful career. In time we also came to know Tom in Wim Wenders' The American Friend (Ripley's Game) in 1977 with Dennis Hopper as Tom; Anthony Minghella's version of The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), with Matt Damon as Tom, then Liliana Cavani's Ripley's Game in 2002 with John Malkovich as Tom. They all are fine in their own satisfyingly nasty ways, although Wim Wenders' version owes more to Wenders than to Highsmith, and Dennis Hopper as Tom is, in my opinion, a stretch. Alain Delon not only makes a completely believable young, poor, envious and callow Tom Ripley, he makes us think twice about those quaint ideas of right and wrong. Ripley plots his killings. In the case of Philippe Greenleaf, his first, Greenleaf is so arrogantly wealthy it's a pleasure to reach the moment, on a small yacht in the middle of a sun-drenched Mediterranean, when we know Tom is going to do something about it. Delon (and Clement) entice us into the conspiracy. Tom takes over Greenleaf's identity as well as a good-sized portion of Greenleaf's money, deals with Greenleaf's lover, disposes of loose ends, some alive but one soon to be dead, and deals with the police. But Tom also is an improviser, at his best when he must act or lose everything. Tension bounces back and forth between Ripley's careful planning and then his ability to act, his instincts, his resourcefulness and his luck. Ripley not only is matter-of-fact murderous, he's clever. But be prepared (and this is not a spoiler) The last two minutes are a complete cop-out. We might be a bit revolted at Tom's activities, but just as we watch that snake in the zoo, we can't help but hope Tom Ripley successfully digests all he attempts to swallow. So which Tom Ripley of the four versions do you like? Me? Damon does a fine job as the young Tom, but Delon is superb. For the older and more assured Tom, it's Malkovich in a class by himself over the incongruously cast Dennis Hopper.

The death of this man, plus a spot of impersonation and forgery, some quick thinking and resourcefulness, put Tom on his path to riches. Of course, it was Tom who did the deed to his friend. Forty minutes into Plein Soleil and Tom Ripley is on his way. Rene Clement's Plein Soleil (Purple Noon), with an incredibly young and handsome Alain Delon as Tom Ripley, was the first filming of Tom's murderous and successful career. In time we also came to know Tom in Wim Wenders' The American Friend (Ripley's Game) in 1977 with Dennis Hopper as Tom; Anthony Minghella's version of The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), with Matt Damon as Tom, then Liliana Cavani's Ripley's Game in 2002 with John Malkovich as Tom. They all are fine in their own satisfyingly nasty ways, although Wim Wenders' version owes more to Wenders than to Highsmith, and Dennis Hopper as Tom is, in my opinion, a stretch. Alain Delon not only makes a completely believable young, poor, envious and callow Tom Ripley, he makes us think twice about those quaint ideas of right and wrong. Ripley plots his killings. In the case of Philippe Greenleaf, his first, Greenleaf is so arrogantly wealthy it's a pleasure to reach the moment, on a small yacht in the middle of a sun-drenched Mediterranean, when we know Tom is going to do something about it. Delon (and Clement) entice us into the conspiracy. Tom takes over Greenleaf's identity as well as a good-sized portion of Greenleaf's money, deals with Greenleaf's lover, disposes of loose ends, some alive but one soon to be dead, and deals with the police. But Tom also is an improviser, at his best when he must act or lose everything. Tension bounces back and forth between Ripley's careful planning and then his ability to act, his instincts, his resourcefulness and his luck. Ripley not only is matter-of-fact murderous, he's clever. But be prepared (and this is not a spoiler) The last two minutes are a complete cop-out. We might be a bit revolted at Tom's activities, but just as we watch that snake in the zoo, we can't help but hope Tom Ripley successfully digests all he attempts to swallow. So which Tom Ripley of the four versions do you like? Me? Damon does a fine job as the young Tom, but Delon is superb. For the older and more assured Tom, it's Malkovich in a class by himself over the incongruously cast Dennis Hopper.

At feeding time wouldn't we rather be the snake than the mouse? Even though we might be revolted by the snake's single-minded swallowing, without benefit of a knife and fork, don't we merely shiver a bit and keep watching? Tom Ripley enjoys a good meal, too. He wants all the good things in life. He doesn't mind causing a little death now and then to get them and to keep them. He takes exception to being looked down upon. Along with Ripley's charm, good nature, easy manners and handsome looks, he has a complete lack of conscience, which combines well with his desire to enjoy what others have.

Tough renegade cop Mace Ryan (Powers Boothe in peak brooding and rugged form) and his feisty partner Karla Withers (a wonderfully spunky turn by the lovely Kate Hodge) use Jake as bait so they can nab Serrano. Ably directed by Dwight H. Little, with a nonstop snappy pace, fluid, glossy cinematography by Ric Waite, gritty urban Chicago locations, plenty of exciting and well-staged fights and shoot-outs (Lee's fierce chopsocky confrontation with the ubiquitous Al Leong rates as a definite thrilling highlight), a smidgen of tasty female nudity, a roaring trashy rock soundtrack, some steamy soft-core sex, a rattling, rousing score by Christopher Young, an amusing line in welcome sarcastic humor, and loads of gloriously excessive bloody violence, this gleefully ridiculous actionfest may be wildly far-fetched and implausible from the get-go, but it's still a great deal of over-the-top loony fun all the same. Best of all, Lee not only displays real charm and appeal in the lead role, but also shows remarkable skill and agility in his numerous rough'n'tumble fight set pieces. The supporting cast likewise impresses, with especially praiseworthy work from Mancuso (his blithely evil villain almost steals the whole show), Boothe, Hodge, Raymond J. Barry as crooked fed Agent Frank Stewart, Tzi Ma as vicious drug lord Kinman Tau, and Tony Longo as Serrano's brutish bodyguard Brunner. A real bang-up flick.
