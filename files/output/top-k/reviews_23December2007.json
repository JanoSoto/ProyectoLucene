With a cast in Home Improvement's Tim Allen, Alien's Sigourney Weaver, Brit Alan Rickman and Monk's very own Tony Shalhoub to name, this movie was destined to be a load of tripe. Suffice to say, it didn't perform well at the box office, both in the US and the UK. However, in spite of all this, Galaxy Quest is surprisingly enough, really good actually and good entertainment it was and is too.A bunch of washed-up actors from a sci-fi TV show, who attend sci-fi conventions, are embroiled in a Star-Trek like adventure of their own, when a group of aliens, who mistake them as heroes, plead for their help, after they find themselves up against an real-life alien nemesis.It is basically a send-off of the Star Trek films, with Allen playing the Captain Kirk role and Weaver as the attractive blonde who repeats what the computer says. Rickman played a Spock- rip off of an alien with a very interesting and witty sense of sarcasm on his part, Sam Rockwell takes on the role of a guy, who seems to take this whole sci-fi thing to the extreme, Shalhoub is the engineer on the ship, who eventually falls for an alien woman and Daryl Mitchell of the US 90s sitcom, Veronica's Closet plays tommy.Although this is essentially a comedy film, one has to be a fan of and has an interest in sci-fi films to be able to understand the jokes and genre conventions in this movie. Therefore, there is humour but it is a certain type of humour that makes Galaxy Quest a good film of its type to be enjoyed.The narrative is interesting but original- Tim Allen and company play sci-fi fans and they are portraying them in a honest and likable fashion. The film acts as vehicle for the actors to perform as their characters, whilst at the same time not perpetuating or reflecting certain stereotypes of for instance, Trekkie's for example in a demeaning way.In any other circumstance or sci-fi movie, this formula wouldn't work effectively, but with Galaxy Quest, it pokes fun at the whole Science Fiction concept in a humorously dry, witty and satirical way through good characterisation and character diversity, in terms of their personalities and the qualities that each of them possess themselves, and funny jokes and one-liners.It is a fun, exciting and humorous adventure of which isn't too short or too long but succeeds in both entertaining and enlivening its audience. It is not often that the juxtaposing of comedy and Sci-Fi works wonders - and yet with Galaxy Quest, it does exactly that.

A rogue reporter, an off and on drunk, who is assigned a human interest story of a man on death row comes to believe in his innocence and must find a way to stop the execution. There are some strong performances by Isaiah Washington, Lisa Gay Hamilton and Diana Venora as well as Eastwood's smooth direction. James Woods to me seemed a little over the top, if only because Eastwood is so relaxed.I have the same problem with this film as I have had with past Eastwood films, and that has to do with his age. Eastwood is 68 in this film; his character is still working - no mention of retirement; he's a ladies man and at the end of the movie he's trying to pick up a 20-something; he has a four-year-old or so daughter. I'm just taking a stab at this - the character is supposed to be, say, 10 to 20 years younger? One assumes then that there is a young wife at home - well, she's young for Eastwood anyway - it's Diana Venora, with whom I went to school. What's the story with this marriage? Is it a recent one? Frankly I'm surprised that Eastwood, who insists on playing roles he's 10 to 20 years too old for, would have tolerated a woman in her forties as his wife. Maybe in his mind, they're the same age. He was running through the forest like an Olympian in Absolute Power while he looked like Father Time; he had ropes in his neck for Bridges of Madison County. Meanwhile, the film Premonition cast Kate Nelligan, age 57, as 43-year-old Sandra Bullock's mother and in Postcards from the Edge, 56-year-old Shirley Maclaine as 41-year-old Meryl Streep's mother. These women evidently lived in states that allowed 14-year-olds to be married.My point is, Hollywood can never get the ages right. Women are pushed into old age in their fifties and the male stars get to play 40-year-olds when they're pushing eighty. At a certain point, it becomes insulting. If this film had been made last year, I suppose Diana Venora would have been playing Clint's mother.So though I like Eastwood very much and his directing very much and found this film compelling, I was distracted - as I have been in the past - by these little details.

But it is also a character study of Sara (Piper Laurie); of Bert (George C. Scott); and of Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason). Of the four, Sara is the most profound. The first step comes after Eddie has lost to Fats. Eddie has great talent, but Bert tells him that Fats has more character -- and character is vital. It is interesting that Bert, a brutal, greedy, immoral man, has this insight into human nature -- in movies the greedy men usually aren't the ones who recognize such things. But Bert doesn't see that buried inside, Eddie has character that just needs to be awakened. Then Eddie meets Sara (Piper Laurie). He talks about the beauty of the game, and the quality of talent -- it is clear that he loves and respects excellence, and loves and respects the game, the way an artist does. Sara sees that Eddie is not just a hustler -- not just a man who uses his talent to take money from others. In fact deep down he isn't really a hustler, he is a man who hustles in order to get the money to keep on doing his art, to try to be the best at his art. At no time in the movie does Eddie show any interest in extravagances -- he doesn't even really mind living out of a bus station locker. In this, The Hustler is similar to another of my favorite films, Babette's Feast. Both movies focus on a very talented person seeking the opportunity to do his or her very best.Sara is a very sad woman. She has a limp, which she explains as the result of a car crash, and says her source of money (she doesn't work) is regular payments from an ex-lover. But eventually she reveals that her limp came from childhood polio, and her payments come from her father (who, contrary to another commenter, isn't dead) who abandoned her and her mother. Her father's rejection of her, and her polio-withered leg, have meant that from an early age she has felt unattractive to men, a feeling that has only been reinforced by a succession of men she mentions who always end up leaving her. She sees Eddie as her last chance. She loves him for the character she sees in him, and sets out to awaken it. But Eddie, needing a financial backer to get another shot at Fats, partners with Bert, who says they'll have to go on the road. When Eddie tells Sara over dinner at a fine restaurant, she sees that he is going to slip away from her like all the other men have; but Eddie doesn't want to lose her, so he decides that she should come with him and Bert. Bert and Sara, meeting, instantly sense that they are in a battle over Eddie Bert, who wants to control Eddie, and Sara, who wants to free him to focus on the art and talent he has. Sara exposes Bert as a man who is so jealous of people with real talent -- talent Bert hasn't got -- that he wants to exploit and destroy those who do have the talent. This reveals the source of Bert's twisted character bitterness over the talent he wishes he had, but does not. Ultimately, Sara decides to sacrifice herself in order to expose, for Eddie, the evil that is at the heart of Bert's character, and thus free Eddie from Bert and trigger Eddie's true character to grow. At the cost of her own life, she succeeds. I doubt whether Eddie was really so significant a person to justify Sara sacrificing herself; she was the more insightful, altruistic, loving person. But she devalued herself, due to the careless and selfish treatment of her by other men, including Eddie; she never had anyone come into her life to tell her they recognized these good things in her. Her sacrifice causes Eddie to realize these things about her, and the tragedy is that it is too late to tell her he sees. With this sacrifice, Eddie's character finally develops into what it can and should be. He goes back to Fats's regular pool hall, challenges him, and quickly beats him. But Bert is there, and Bert demands a cut of Eddie's winnings. Eddie refuses, and Bert signals that some of the other men in the pool hall will beat him up if Eddie doesn't pay. And here is where we learn something about Fats. Fats just sits in his usual spot when Bert delivers this threat, and he advises Eddie that he'd better pay. And now we know that Fats is a man who surrendered to Bert. Fats's regular pool hall is controlled by Bert, some of the men in it are enforcers in Bert's employ, and Fats is the talent who attracts people to the hall. That's why Fats shows up every night at 8 PM, regularly. It's part of the arrangement he has fallen into with Bert. Bert is hoping that Eddie will take Fats' place, and keep the business going for another decade or two. And it is to help Eddie escape this kind of fate that Sara sacrificed herself. Eddie faces down Bert, and leaves. He and Fats acknowledge each other's talent as Eddie leaves. Sara's sacrifice has been successful. Eddie will be his own man, not a tool of a greedy soulless man like Bert. And this is why The Hustler is really about Piper Laurie's Sara a good woman dealt an unfair hand by life, trying to do some good in the world by causing a man to become a better man -- and she succeeds.

","genre":"Drama, Sport"},{"date":"23 December 2007","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" With the title The Hustler, we expect a character study of Paul Newman's pool hustler Eddie Felson. But it is also a character study of Sara (Piper Laurie); of Bert (George C. Scott); and of Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason). Of the four, Sara is the most profound. The first step comes after Eddie has lost to Fats. Eddie has great talent, but Bert tells him that Fats has more character -- and character is vital. It is interesting that Bert, a brutal, greedy, immoral man, has this insight into human nature -- in movies the greedy men usually aren't the ones who recognize such things. But Bert doesn't see that buried inside, Eddie has character that just needs to be awakened. Then Eddie meets Sara (Piper Laurie). He talks about the beauty of the game, and the quality of talent -- it is clear that he loves and respects excellence, and loves and respects the game, the way an artist does. Sara sees that Eddie is not just a hustler -- not just a man who uses his talent to take money from others. In fact deep down he isn't really a hustler, he is a man who hustles in order to get the money to keep on doing his art, to try to be the best at his art. At no time in the movie does Eddie show any interest in extravagances -- he doesn't even really mind living out of a bus station locker. In this, The Hustler is similar to another of my favorite films, Babette's Feast. Both movies focus on a very talented person seeking the opportunity to do his or her very best.Sara is a very sad woman. She has a limp, which she explains as the result of a car crash, and says her source of money (she doesn't work) is regular payments from an ex-lover. But eventually she reveals that her limp came from childhood polio, and her payments come from her father (who, contrary to another commenter, isn't dead) who abandoned her and her mother. Her father's rejection of her, and her polio-withered leg, have meant that from an early age she has felt unattractive to men, a feeling that has only been reinforced by a succession of men she mentions who always end up leaving her. She sees Eddie as her last chance. She loves him for the character she sees in him, and sets out to awaken it. But Eddie, needing a financial backer to get another shot at Fats, partners with Bert, who says they'll have to go on the road. When Eddie tells Sara over dinner at a fine restaurant, she sees that he is going to slip away from her like all the other men have; but Eddie doesn't want to lose her, so he decides that she should come with him and Bert. Bert and Sara, meeting, instantly sense that they are in a battle over Eddie Bert, who wants to control Eddie, and Sara, who wants to free him to focus on the art and talent he has. Sara exposes Bert as a man who is so jealous of people with real talent -- talent Bert hasn't got -- that he wants to exploit and destroy those who do have the talent. This reveals the source of Bert's twisted character bitterness over the talent he wishes he had, but does not. Ultimately, Sara decides to sacrifice herself in order to expose, for Eddie, the evil that is at the heart of Bert's character, and thus free Eddie from Bert and trigger Eddie's true character to grow. At the cost of her own life, she succeeds. I doubt whether Eddie was really so significant a person to justify Sara sacrificing herself; she was the more insightful, altruistic, loving person. But she devalued herself, due to the careless and selfish treatment of her by other men, including Eddie; she never had anyone come into her life to tell her they recognized these good things in her. Her sacrifice causes Eddie to realize these things about her, and the tragedy is that it is too late to tell her he sees. With this sacrifice, Eddie's character finally develops into what it can and should be. He goes back to Fats's regular pool hall, challenges him, and quickly beats him. But Bert is there, and Bert demands a cut of Eddie's winnings. Eddie refuses, and Bert signals that some of the other men in the pool hall will beat him up if Eddie doesn't pay. And here is where we learn something about Fats. Fats just sits in his usual spot when Bert delivers this threat, and he advises Eddie that he'd better pay. And now we know that Fats is a man who surrendered to Bert. Fats's regular pool hall is controlled by Bert, some of the men in it are enforcers in Bert's employ, and Fats is the talent who attracts people to the hall. That's why Fats shows up every night at 8 PM, regularly. It's part of the arrangement he has fallen into with Bert. Bert is hoping that Eddie will take Fats' place, and keep the business going for another decade or two. And it is to help Eddie escape this kind of fate that Sara sacrificed herself. Eddie faces down Bert, and leaves. He and Fats acknowledge each other's talent as Eddie leaves. Sara's sacrifice has been successful. Eddie will be his own man, not a tool of a greedy soulless man like Bert. And this is why The Hustler is really about Piper Laurie's Sara a good woman dealt an unfair hand by life, trying to do some good in the world by causing a man to become a better man -- and she succeeds.

The story, as everyone probably knows by now, centers on one Ebenezer Scrooge, a greedy and mean-spirited moneylender who thinks only of money and can only respond to Christmas with bah, humbug! On Christmas Eve, he receives an unexpected visit from his deceased business partners, who warn him that three spirits will transport him to his past, present, and future. Grudgingly, Scrooge goes along with the spirits, and eventually realizes that his selfish acts will provide not only drastic consequences for himself, but for the welfare of his long-suffering clerk, Bob Cratchit, and his sickly son, Tiny Tim.The film follows the original tale faithfully, and more importantly, keeps most of the dark, sometimes dreary tone of Dickens' tale. Since the story has its share of heartbreaking moments, it is surprising that this movie, skillfully directed by Brian Henson, manages to handle them in a very emotional way without coming across as forced or out of place. Scenes such as Scrooge witnessing the departure of his former love Belle and an even more devastating sequence where the Cratchit family mourns the loss of their beloved, frail son (keep in mind that this is only a vision) all manage to tug at the right heartstrings effectively.Naturally, the Muppets do sneak in ways to provide a bit of humor in various places, but in an adaptation like this, it is most welcome. Actually, most of the laughs come from the Great Gonzo as Charles Dickens, who narrates the story to a skeptical Rizzo Rat as the latter questions about whether the scary stuff is appropriate for children. That's all right, this is culture, explains Gonzo, er, Dickens, respectively.It is a treat to see Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy as the Cratchits and even more amusing to see those old tycoons Statler and Waldorf as the ghosts of Scrooge's deceased business partners, but the whole weight of the movie rests on the performance of Michael Caine as Mr. Bah Humbug himself. He plays the role flawlessly, somehow managing to blend in with his Muppet and human co-stars. Also noteworthy are the creation of the spirits themselves Christmas Past is a ghostly-like child, Present is a jolly, Santa Claus like giant, while Future is a dark-robed, faceless figure who is made all the more scary by the fact that he is mute. Paul Williams' musical numbers are also very sprightly and infectiously catchy, well-suited to both the spirit of Christmas and the story itself.All in all, THE MUPPET Christmas CAROL is great family entertainment, but even adults may find a lot to enjoy too.

Despite the rapid rise of Fascism, you would never know it inside the bawdy cabaret where much of the movie is set. Here, it is all laughter and gaiety--no sign of the coming war. The apparent stars of this show are Joel Grey (a master of ceremonies who has no other role in the film) and Liza Minelli (an incredibly screwed up American singer and dancer). The utter banality of the cabaret as well as Liza's personal life are a deliberate counter-point to the seriousness of the day. Despite antisemitism running amok, Liza is oblivious to it all--living her hollow and self-indulgent life. How she screws it up and the bizarre relationships she has are makes up about half the film and the rest consists of song and dance numbers. In many ways, it's like two totally separate films fused together.Surprisingly, I found I enjoyed the non-musical portion much more. Liza plays a fascinating character--a perfect film example of a borderline personality. This personality disorder is typified by love-hate relationships, self-absorption, self-destructive behaviors, magical thinking and an inability to accept that they are not the center of the universe. It's obvious that the writers had worked with some mental health professionals to nail this so well. While not fun to watch (after all, who wants to watch a self-absorbed idiot?), it was fascinating. Some of Liza's odd and self-absorbed behaviors included sexual relationships with gay and bisexual men which are destined to fail, extreme promiscuity, alcohol abuse, shallowness and magical thinking. Sadly, in some ways this sounds a bit like Ms. Minelli's real life, though I do wish her the best in her recovery.As for the rest of the cast, they were mostly there for Minelli's character to play off of. Yes, Michael York and others are there, but most of the reason seems to be to provide texture to Minelli's life as well as to provide SOME semblance of normalcy. They see that Germany is slowly descending to Hell, but Liza's character is simply oblivious.CABARET is a very good film, that I won't argue. But for the film to have garnered eight Oscars--that I find very hard to understand. Now it's true that many of these were for musical or set design awards, but still the film doesn't seem that exceptional. Perhaps I am just missing something or perhaps it's because I've seen other films about the Nazi period in Germany that just seemed better. Or, perhaps it's because I preferred the parts of the film where they were NOT singing--for as a musical, it's songs aren't all that memorable. Aside from the rather annoying Money Makes the World Go Around and Cabaret, most people would have a hard time remembering the songs that play such a prominent role in the film.Also, while I do agree that Minelli deserved the Oscar for her demanding performance, I was very surprised to see Joel Grey get one as well. Yes, he did also work hard, but he really had no lines at all in the film--everything he did was singing and dancing and clowning around on stage. With no life beyond the stage, it's very surprising that he won. I assume that part of this was because with three nominees for Best Supporting Actor from THE GODFATHER, the three actors split their votes--allowing the unusual performance by Grey to grab the trophy. I know Grey can act, as he's been amazing in other roles, but here he just sings, dances and acts bizarre---an odd choice for the award.Overall, while this was a very interesting film, I didn't particularly enjoy it. I know MANY disagree with me and they may be right, but given my tastes I just didn't care for the film.

I can still remember seeing myself and making funny faces as I leaned into the chrome bumpers on my father's car as I polished it as a little boy. But those reflections and those cars grow old I don't need to do anything funny to make my nose look large or my face look funny anymore. That car has rotted past rust by now. And this movie is a study in aging and our reaction to it.Mr. Dodsworth is a solid citizen, an okay, straight-arrow kind of man who isn't an angel and isn't a devil, just a plain good man with his strengths and failures. He has pulled himself up by his bootstraps and done better than most, building a powerful automobile manufacturing business and a strong family and bonds with friends. Upon retirement he listens to his wife who has never been satisfied in their little home town but wants to go to Europe where she visited briefly and which she now considers her rightful place. The movie is the story of this fickle, foolish woman trying to flee inevitable age by trying to be what she is not while her husband supports her time and again with the kind of faithfulness born of his own needs and habits as much as old-fashioned morality.Ironically, when his opportunity comes to find youth and romance again, you long for him to take it while you've been crying for the wife to wake up through the entire film. It is that balance between running from old age, embracing the accomplishments of a lifetime, and finding youth in love no matter what your chronological age, that drives the picture.You know a great film when you lose yourself in it and start thinking about your own issues. What have you accomplished in life? What is awaiting you? What are you living for, what is worth dying for, and what would you do if you could, even at this point...and why aren't you doing it now? You will find yourself asking and struggling with all of these issues in the course of this film. You will see your own reflection in the shining surface, a mirror to examine an aging face, or a window, to examine the world.And speaking of shining things, this cast is made up of some of the greatest names to ever work in film. This film shows why. Even across the decades, even across faded black and white, their voices, their expressions, still gleam. And in their smiles and tears you will be able to see what is important about the life you've lived, the life you could have lived, and the life and love you can still find, if you want it.

Upon retirement he listens to his wife who has never been satisfied in their little home town but wants to go to Europe where she visited briefly and which she now considers her rightful place. The movie is the story of this fickle, foolish woman trying to flee inevitable age by trying to be what she is not while her husband supports her time and again with the kind of faithfulness born of his own needs and habits as much as old-fashioned morality.Ironically, when his opportunity comes to find youth and romance again, you long for him to take it while you've been crying for the wife to wake up through the entire film. It is that balance between running from old age, embracing the accomplishments of a lifetime, and finding youth in love no matter what your chronological age, that drives the picture.You know a great film when you lose yourself in it and start thinking about your own issues. What have you accomplished in life? What is awaiting you? What are you living for, what is worth dying for, and what would you do if you could, even at this point...and why aren't you doing it now? You will find yourself asking and struggling with all of these issues in the course of this film. You will see your own reflection in the shining surface, a mirror to examine an aging face, or a window, to examine the world.And speaking of shining things, this cast is made up of some of the greatest names to ever work in film. This film shows why. Even across the decades, even across faded black and white, their voices, their expressions, still gleam. And in their smiles and tears you will be able to see what is important about the life you've lived, the life you could have lived, and the life and love you can still find, if you want it.

I was part of a dot com venture and it really brought back the memories of everything is impossible, we are unstoppable that was pushed by those that run the ventures. And in the case of govworks.com, the gorgeous and charismatic CEO even met Clinton. How could it all go wrong? The documentary also charts, in fact in particular charts, the effect of the company on the personal relationships of those involved. Some of the agonies they face are better than stories you see in scripted dramas, and because they are so real they are very involving.It's a shame that the latter stage's of the company's demise are skipped over, we cut from them having over 200 employees to just 50 with no real explanation on what happened in between. Maybe it wasn't really required, maybe they didn't want to be filmed, but it felt like a bit of a hole.

In this case we are dealing with China. Corrupted people are framing up an American TV man in order to prevent a contract being signed that does not go in the right direction for their interests. The point is that the corrupted and plotting official is the son of a highly respected man, a son who was educated in the West and brought back his corruption, or at least a good knowledge and know how about it, from his foreign sojourn. He is using the opaque situation in changing China to cover up his dealings and has a little group of plotters and accomplices to manage his operations. But the film tries to show how the Chinese today are realizing from their own experience and history, even from their own culture that includes Mao Zedong and a couple other revolutionaries, that they have to change in their own minds and then change their country. This cannot come from outside, especially not from the US that is no model, neither social nor economic nor even political, but it has to come from inside, from deep down in the souls, the minds and the spirits of the Chinese. What is most difficult for us to understand is that the Chinese live on a completely different set of principles and concepts and that they have to invent a new open society from their very concepts and philosophy. Democracy for example cannot be the same thing in China and the USA or France, for the very simple reason that it is not the same in the USA, Great Britain, France of Italy, not to speak of Japan and Finland. There is not one model. There are many models that are therefore no models at all. The film very carefully and cautiously tries to show us how the mind of a person can open little by little when confronted to real life if that person is simply honest with himself or herself, with his or her own principles, with his or her conception of justice. This leads that person to considering the very concept of human being, of individual, of subject, of what is necessary for that individual to feel free and happy. The very point we are confronted to with China is that it is one fourth of humanity or so and no one has any interest in a brutal and uncontrolled change in a direction that is not carried and supported by the heritage of the country, its history, its culture. The United States have a strange but understandable reaction in front of the rest of the world because they are all the descendants of immigrants who left a culture and a history behind them to build out of conscious and willful choices a new history and a new culture, a heritage that became something that had to be built out of nothing or very little. They cannot understand that other countries will not be able to do any change that would break up the fabric and material of the country itself. If you did that you would provoke a ferocious reaction that could just wash you away in one wink of an eye. Actually the Americans today are not better or worse than other countries and peoples. If we from outside told them you have to rationalize your political system on the let's say German model, they would jump to the sky, and yet how can we accept that the political system is not the same in all the states, that citizens have to publicly declare themselves democrat or republican to be able to take part in the primaries, which goes against the very principle of democracy which is the secrecy of our political choices and our ballots. And If Europeans told the United States that they have to ban the death penalty within one or two or three years to be granted the privilege of being recognized as a democracy and keep the status of permanent veto-endowed member of the Security Council of the United Nations that could be withdrawn from them because of their not having banned the death penalty, they would react violently and viciously. Yet to join the European Community you have to ban the death penalty.

Is a good and respectable opinion, no matter if was based or not in the book ideas. The film deals with the dawn of men, the apes, thing that reminds so much the Darwin theory i guess. The follow up to a world that not even today could imagine before seeing it. And its meaningful ending. But these three things are connected for an instrument, an element, that maybe could explain the continuity of the race, of future.I understand how people could be amazed in those times. Kubrick's manage of widescreen is very important, and here is not a joke! Just like in movies like Dario Argento's Suspiria, that could be an excellent example. You cant feel the exactly masterful feeling if your eyes don't note all the whole thing, and here in 2001 this happen, as one of these masterful (Sorry the word repetition) achievements.

You cant feel the exactly masterful feeling if your eyes don't note all the whole thing, and here in 2001 this happen, as one of these masterful (Sorry the word repetition) achievements. The shots of space are more than wonderful, are breathtaking! The music is more than appropriate, is perfect. But is of course slowly, and this is one of its achievement, but is a thing too that undoubtedly some people can take as the boring thing. The film is very slowly and full of silence, just like space is. But of course, although that this film never going to be dated (i think none film is) but people of today for example now is accustomed for other things, with more action and quickly artificial effects, and this movie is not like those. This one have such spectacular special effects, so perfect that you don't see any artificiality, you believe it. The use of colors, as its music, are more than masterful, are used for be hypnotic, just what this film deserve.In other situation, through the story of course appears too a topic that was handled perfectly just before in Fritz Lang's Metropolis, the technological domination, in this case our beloved infamous Hal.This is undoubtedly one of the best movies ever made, but is, a funny thing, not one of my favorites. Sometimes i feel it so hard to taking it, maybe for be so slowing, that is, like i say before, another great achievement. In spite of this, i think that is a necessary movie, where it seems that our humanity is driven mad, but the ending of this movie is a true that humans, being physical or spiritual, must to face for grow up. In some way, for good.PD Althoug that this film don't is one of my favorites, and i feel the thing very slowly, i give it a 10, because the idea is giving impartial and veridical critics, the film is breathtaking and is excellently made. Maybe i could change of opinion, i think that this is one of those films that you must see and see again. Don loose it, and be patient, is worth it! And please, see it in widescreen! *Sorry for the mistakes ... well, if there any.

Based on the short story written by Nolan's brother, the movie follows Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), a man on the hunt for the person responsible for the rape and murder of his wife. The catch Leonard suffers from anterograde amnesia, he is unable to create new memories. So to keep track of his investigation, he must take notes and pictures; in some cases, actually tattooing the facts onto his body. During his hunt, he must learn to distinguish between those who aim to help him, and those who aim to use him.As you probably know, the real interesting aspect of this movie is that its events are told in reverse. The movie begins at the end of the story and works its way to the start. In doing this, Nolan keeps the audience in the same state as Leonard himself. Just as Leonard has no recollection of how he came to be where he is, neither does the person watching the movie. In editing the movie in this way, Nolan helps the audience sympathize with Leonard's situation and his constant confusion. Of course, this style is definitely not for everyone. In fact, a good chunk of the people I've shown this movie to can't stand it for that very reason. They become too confused and can't follow the story, so they give up and walk away. Oh well, in my opinion, it's their loss. I personally thought it made the movie that much better, almost placing the viewer in Leonard's scenario. And despite the fact the movie starts at the end, there are still a couple twists the audience may not see coming.The story, while seemingly a simple concept, is fantastic (and definitely complex). The characters are shady and you never know who to trust. Joe Pantoliano plays Teddy, a cop who has been helping Leonard in his search, and Carrie-Anne Moss plays a waitress who agrees to help Leonard but may have a deeper connection to the situation. Without knowledge of prior events, like the protagonist, the audience is left suspicious of everyone Leonard encounters.Despite the many haters of this film out there, I think everyone should give this movie a chance. It may be a bit confusing at times, but it all pays off by the time you've figured it out.

Jerry is one of Paris' many starving artists though he's a happy one, in a neighborhood where he knows everyone and has formed many friendships with fellow artists. Then he is discovered by an older patron (Nina Foch) who wants him for more than his art. Jerry, however, has fallen in love with his friend Henri's (Guetary) girl Lise (Caron), though he doesn't realize that she is involved with Henri. Lise falls for Jerry, too, but feels a strong commitment to Henri. The beauty of Paris begins to fade.This is a beautifully directed film photographed in color, and some of it is really eye-popping. With Kelly and Caron as the leads, there is lots of great dancing to the Gershwin tunes, with Kelly at his exuberant, athletic best and Caron, introduced in this film, shown dancing a variety of styles from sexy to sublime. Levant is there with his dry quips and wonderful concertizing on the piano, and Guetary, an exciting singer, performs Stairway to Paradise and gives out with some great high notes in By Strauss. As the glamorous, lonely patron, Nina Foch is excellent, managing to evoke sympathy in a normally unsympathetic role.Reading through some of the comments on the board, I find them disturbing. An American in Paris is a vibrant, colorful musical with magnificent dancing and songs that capture the way of life everyone believes exists in France - the romance, the cafés, the fun of poverty and the beauty of the city of Paris itself. It isn't Ibsen. It isn't meant to be realistic; it is meant to be charming, and in that, it succeeds. It doesn't need a script like The Grapes of Wrath; it needs a script to get from song to song and give us feeling for the characters, and in that, it succeeds. There is a complaint that Jerry's interest in Lise is shallow. In film noir, a woman and a man's eyes meet, and they're instantly joined at the hip, and we accept it. We can't accept in a musical that Jerry saw Lise and fell for her? My suggestion? Take a film on the level it's presented and don't try to make it something it's not. So often on this board, people complain that a film didn't do this and didn't do that when it was never supposed to do this or that. Maybe it was supposed to do just one thing - entertain. And in that, American in Paris succeeds as well or better than just about anything else.

There are so many scenes and shots that reflect this. A book could be written about the camera work alone; I'm sure it has.Everything has already been written about this film. But for those viewing for the first time (or for me, about only the fifth time) what really stands out are1) the use of silence not only to tell the story (Melanie's surprise birthday visit to the Brenner house), but to heighten the suspense and tension (Melanie on the bench smoking in front of the Jungle Jim, or her flashlight walk up the stairs to open the door, or the whole sequence before and during the second attack in the house, or Lydia's visit to her neighbor's farm -- the list goes on and on.) Most of the time it is real silence, since there's no music sound track in 99% of the picture to distract from the intensity of the moment created by absolute silence.2) The beautifully framed composition of so many of the shots, for example, in all of the various one-sided telephone conversations in Bodega Bay; the last scene of Mitch and Melanie in The Tides Restaurant facing the customers; the famous final 'door' opening sequence from shadow to light. Watching the film this time I just had to stare open mouthed at the artistry displayed before me.3) Hitchcock's respect for the audience. He doesn't slam us with a noisy soundtrack to punctuate the action, he makes such a thing unnecessary. He gets the same effects with silence. He doesn't slam us with dripping gore and bloody corpses to create horror, he tells us that is unnecessary. He gets the same effects with quick cutting, and seeing things from the character's eyes.4) Those famous Hitchcock touches, where every day objects become omens of danger or horror, as when Lydia, after having picked up her own china from a bird attack in her house, sees broken china cups hanging in her neighbor's kitchen. You know by seeing the broken china that something horrible is going to happen, and it does. He knows how to build the suspense we watch Melanie sit on a bench smoking for what seems like forever.

The film chronicles the lives of 2 petty thieves, a pair of mob hit-men, an aging boxer and a crime-lord's wife as somehow each one of them get caught up in tough, bizarre and comical situations. The way the story plays out with somewhat random events, is truly what makes this film great. This is what makes it feel like real-life and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The film is over-the-top stylized and is beautifully shot. The story is amazing, but you must be thinking, what about the cast? With some of the biggest names in the film industry, you will not believe this is an independent flick. The acting is at top notch with witty, funny lines that you will remember for years to come. You cannot ask for much more when watching Pulp Fiction. Everything is just too perfect. 10\/10.

The premiss for the movie seemed to have potential but it turns out to be a disaster. I'm watching the movie and I'm thinking what is the point?, if I watch it a bit longer it will go somewhere, have something to say, something, anything. I (painfully) watched it to the end and nope, nothing. The movie is a desert, there's just nothing there.Let me explain, what DOES the movie say? From what I could gather the message seems to be that human beings have good and bad in them. Not only good and bad strictly speaking but also somethings that lie perhaps in some gray area and some others that have nothing to do with morality such as artistic drive. In short, human beings are what they are - a mass of contradictions with many different facets, so on a so fourth. Further the message seems to be that we are better off - that it is better (?) - as such than as one-dimensional characters with only, shall we say pleasant, characteristics.And that's it. I looked, I tried to find something more, but there is nothing else. Now, I ask my self how retarded is that? That insults the viewer's intelligence, even. Do we really need a - however long this movie is - to tell us the above? Without bad there can't exist good, right? As obvious as that is the movie doesn't even make that point. It's too much of a barren wasteland. It just seems to make the point that we are better off the way we are than as some sort of one-dimensional automatons. Which is in-itself debatable because if the so-called automatons are happy and it is a well known fact that humanity at large for the most part isn't, and I personally see no point nor meaning in life or existence anyway, perhaps it would be better to just be happy.But such considerations, or indeed any others, never get any air time.
