[{"date":"24 March 2000","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  This mid 70's slice of life comedy is charming in spots, but mostly insubstantial.  It is the story of a working class teenager from Rhode Island named Timothy Dunphy (Shawn Hatosy) who is sent to prep school for getting into trouble with the police.  The story meanders through his exploits with his friends at home, his relationship with his father (Alec Baldwin), and his situations with his new preppy friends and with the evil headmaster.  The film has its moments, but mostly it is a nostalgic retrospective on prep life in the 1970's with little in the way of a plot.Having gone to college in Rhode Island in the 1970's, I can identify with the period, and Rhode Islande born director Michael Corrente, through the look and feel of the New England settings and the background music, did a good job of bringing back a flood of memories from that time.Shawn Hatosy did an excellent job in his portrayal of a working class teen, trying to make the best of what he considered a bad situation.  His acting, though not yet very polished, is very sincere and this part seemed to fit his personality well.  Amy Smart, as his girlfriend Jane, is a fresh face with a sweet look; just perfect for the nice girl role.  Smart also exuded sincerity so the screen chemistry between the two was excellent.Alec Baldwin finally found a role where his new paunchy look was an asset.  Actually, he was quite good as Timothy's rather crude dad, doing the best he could with limited intellectual assets.  Baldwin, who usually plays clever characters, gave a realistic and enjoyable performance of a working class stiff, though his accent was a little too stereotypical and not true to Rhode Island.I gave this film a 6\/10.  It relied too heavily on New England charm and there was just not enough story.  Though there were funny scenes sprinkled here and there and the ending was nice, it just lacked the horsepower to really keep the viewer engaged throughout.

Written by Gail Gilchriest, based on the book by Willie Morris.  Running time 95 minutes. Rated PG (for brief violence and mild language). \tMy Dog Skip is an emotionally effective and challengingly involving piece of cinema. The film, directed by Jay Russell, based on a writing by Willie Morris, works well because it proves two theories 1) The war affected not only the soldiers in battle, but also normal families in minor but critical methods, and 2) Childhood can be best remembered by our fond memories with the family's dog. These elements present the audience with an accurate and knowledgeable atmosphere with memorable characters and issues.\tThe movie is set in the summer of 1942. The story explores a family of three, Jack, Ellen, and Willie Morris. Jack (Kevin Bacon) is the heartbroken father who lost his leg in war years ago. Ellen (Diane Lane) is the simple minded housewife doing more manual labors than women usually complete. Willie (TV's Frankie Muniz) is their lonely son-maybe ten years of age. He has no local friends, is poor at sports and teased at school. His best acquaintance is in his mid twenties, a mechanic named Dink (Luke Wilson), who is called for battle not too long into the picture, leaving Willie all alone. Ellen decides to go against father's orders and purchase Willie a faithful companion of his own for his birthday a puppy. Although Jack firmly opposes this gift, his wife convinces him Willie is old enough to take care of a dog. Willie names his new friend Skip, who drinks out of the toilet, does not obey commands, and seemingly understands human emotions.\tMy Dog Skip wisely uses the war as a mood developing overtone; a background event that provokes confusion in Willie and gradually changes the lives of those around him. The time period is ideal for such a film to take place. The filmmakers produce a lifelike atmosphere that perfectly defines what living in the 1940's was like. \tThe film features beautiful and captivating performances by everyone in the cast. Frankie Muniz, from Fox's Malcolm in the Middle on TV, is very effective and well cast. He creates the appropriate narrative connection the film depends upon. Kevin Bacon is broad yet poignant, with a bold mood of a father in the 40's. Luke Wilson is also successful here, making his dynamic character obvious throughout.  Diane Lane does not have enough screen time to explore any real material, but creates rich character chemistry with Bacon. The movie could investigate the Luke Wilson character more thoroughly. About half way into the story, My Dog Skip nearly drops this seemingly important character only to later bring him back to supply the plot with several crucial sequences. Skip's intelligence appears to altered in various scenes throughout the production. In one scene, the dog will presumably understand human emotion and restore motivation. In others he cannot accomplish simple tricks and drinks out of the family toilet. This animal, although very significant character, needs to be more consistent and less exaggerated.  Most of the film's dialogue is right on the money; smart and fitting. It is not too straightforward or excessively blunt, but gentle and thematic. Most of My Dog Skip is gentle-hearted, however, and provides the lovable atmosphere that starving audiences are searching for, along with high quality and entertaining situations, in family based movies. If this description fits you, regardless of age, this is the movie you are looking for.My Dog Skip is brought to you by Warner Bros.

And by sort of stretching out of his New York skin, as he also did with Love and Death and Bananas to an extent (though even more winningly here), there's some fresh ground to break. There's also some great team-work with Diane Keaton- the first time the two teamed up under Allen's direction. Topping this with a sensational up-beat rag-time jazz score by Allen and his band-mates (the only time Woody's done the bit as composer), you've got great one-liners, great physical comedy, and superb, jokey production design.

However, its good but not great. The movie is shamelessly commercial (something that increases in subsequent movies) product placement is far too high on the agenda! The pre-title sequence is spectacular but perhaps too far fetched even for a Bond movie! Brosnan combines the many great attributes of Connery with the wit and charm of Moore. Here he interprets Bond with a characterisation that is both commanding and refreshing after the Dalton era. The trouble with the film is that it promised so much but delivered very little. Alright, there are some of the most stunning action scenes yet to be filmed in a Bond to be found here. Nevertheless, it lacks a certain something. In many ways it reminds me greatly of Dr No the first Bond film made in 1962. Goldeneye is the rebirth of the Bond franchise. Not since the sixties had 007 caused quite a stir. I think one of the biggest reasons I don't get that Bond feeling from Goldeneye is largely due to Eric Serra's woefully poor soundtrack. It's simply awful. Electronic sounds substitute the classy brass sound given to Bond by John Barry.  Tina Turner provides an adequate title track, but not since A View To A Kill have we heard a truly great Bond song. Sean Bean dumps his heavy Yorkshire burr in favour of a typical English upper class accent in order to play baddie Alec Trevelyan. Scottish born Robbie Coltrane does likewise in order to play the Russian, Valentin. In fact I'm pretty sure there's not one native Russian in the film. A pity really since the Russians hadn't been the enemy for a number of films prior to this one. For me its difficult to accept such well known British actors with accents other then their own.

Now that I have, I can only express my disappointment. I don't think the slightest attempt was made to capture the romance, the passion, and the pure ambience of the story. Now I do concede, as has been said many times, that if a novel is good enough to be made into a movie, it's probably not even worth it. It's old news that the book is always better than the movie. I grant this, but much more still could have been done with it. This movie should have been an homage to the novel, but it was in fact a disgrace.However, as a film it did have some redeeming qualities. The cinematography was beautiful, the acting superb. Tom Cruise is in his element here (larger-than-life characters) and they don't get much larger than the Vampire Lestat. I cannot envision anyone else take on the role the way he did.

The opening sequence is something I consider unintentionally funny. Though it was Mary Shelley who wrote the original novel, she certainly did NOT write what wound up on the screen the first time around nor this (though it must be said that the idea for this movie was inspired by a little plot point in the novel as well as Fritz Lang's Metropolis). Una O'Connor as Minnie the Maid (and the nosy landlady of The Invisible Man) has to be one of the most annoying characters ever captured on film. I desperately wanted someone to shut her up (preferably the monster), but, oh well. She does fit in well with the blackly humorous tone of the film.Thesinger's Dr Praetorius seems to owe at least his hairstyle, if not his entire performance, to Metropolis madman, Rotwang. Thesinger camps it up for all it's worth, making the word slime leap to the top of my adjectives to describe this guy. And, of course, no review of this movie would be complete with some comment on Karloff and Lancaster. Had the fifty word vocabulary been given to anyone else, this whole movie could have become a bad joke. As it is, Karloff is able to make such simple phrases as Friend good...alone bad. into incredibly powerful statements on the monster's loneliness. The heart of this film is, without a doubt, the scenes at the hermit's cabin. When the hermit lays the monster down to sleep and says a prayer for them both, I choke up every time. Who can't identify with the acceptance of another after so much misery?Lancaster makes less of an impression on me, but there is no denying that her scenes as Mary Shelley and the Bride are unforgettable. Those quick, precise movements of her head (said to have been inspired by Briggette Helm's performance as the android in Metropolis), the unforgettable hairdo (which was taken from portraits of Egyptian Queen Nefreti), and the deafening scream she utters at seeing the poor, hopeful Monster who has gone to such pains to make this come about stay in the mind quite well. The final conclusion of this film, to me, is the end of the Universal story of Frankenstein. All that came from Universal after this one are merely imitators.

In a decade, _The Shawshank Redemption_ will be grouped into the cinematic canon alongside such triumphs as _Citizen Kane_ and _Dr. Strangelove_. It's not an unmerited distinction. An example of truly flawless filmmaking.

This movie does an outstanding job at showing just that.  I have seen this movie many times and it never becomes old.  Its more than just merely a war movie or a biography of a contravercial general.  It becomes more of a poetic dance of WWII.      The cinimatics are incredible.  Some of the shots, such as Patton arriving in his London room and the shot focusing on him in the cealling mirror, are just amazing.  The battle scenes are some of the best and most convincing in a movie ever.  They are excellent for something done in the days before Platoon and Saving Private Ryan.      George Scott gives a brilliant performance as Patton.  Could they have found anyone that looked more like him?  Scott's brilliant acting convinces you even more that this man is Patton, with his pearl revolvers and hot temper.       We cant forget Karl Malden either.  His portrayal of Omar Bradley is most accurate.  He comes across as a kind man who is simply doing his job very well.  In fact I cant think of a single person in this entire movie who doesn't play their part well.      I have but one tiny gripe for this movie.  Patton was a known anti semite.  This movie does very little to show that.  Although this movie was more out to show how Patton wasn't a bad guy in a world of people that despised him.    A must watch for any WWII or war fan.

It was a brilliant look at the Gulf War and stretched beyond the boundaries of all war movies before it. David O. Russell did an excellent job writing and directing this movie and George Clooney gave one of the best performances of the year. Mark Wahlberg proved that his work can go beyond that of Dirk Diggler. Spike Jonze was hilarious as Wahlberg's lacky.  Watching the movie is a memorable experience.  It's way out there with it's comedic sense of timing, awesome action sequences, and morals to match.  It dealt with the political issues of the Gulf War which was seen as a pretty harmless war from an American's standpoint. Russell showed us the plight of the freedom fighters in Iraq and told a very serious story, but did it with a sense of humor that was neither tasteless nor melodramatic.  Russell kept an even tone throughout the entire movie and perfectly blended the action,black comedy,and war genres into what was one of the year's best.  An entertaining movie that never ceases to amaze me.  I still am trying to figure out why it didn't get nominated for any Oscars.  I hope that one day people will see this move for what it is...a masterpiece.

Don't get me wrong, it is way worse than Scream but still entertaining and definitely better than Urban Legend etc. The script was written by Kevin Williamson who is also the author of the Scream-screenplay. The motive of the killer is not that brilliant (but neither was the one of Billy & Stu). The film gets pretty interesting once the slasher-action starts. The suspense is great and there are several scenes that made me jump.The story is sometimes a little confusing and I didn't find myself rooting for the teens because the actors are rather pale in this movie. However the film delivers some very creative scenes that are truly enjoyable and different from the death scenes in other 90s slasher films.What I didn't understand was why the fisherman also killed some people that weren't even involved in the situation. He's not a deranged killer like Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees who can't distinguish what is good and what is evil. Unlike Michael and Jason he wants to take his revenge on the teens and has a plan of how to do it. It's not because I'm offended by pointless violence but this just doesn't make sense (on the other hand it wasn't supposed to win an Oscar).Beside Scream, this is the only teen-horror flick that is really entertaining and (at least partly) inventive.My rating 8\/10 (Forget about the sequel, it's not worth the money) ","genre":null},{"date":"24 March 2000","score":"","review":"  After the success of Scream we had the pleasure to see a lot of rather cheap imitations but IKWYDLS is probably the only good one among these.
