He also learns that maybe if he were a real boy (yes, this has some references to Pinnochio, his mother would accept him, which she does at first, but then neglects after her son is revived.Her son, which we learn later on, is a manipulative brat who grows jealous of David. He tells him to do horrible things and ultimately gets him thrown out of his home. While away from his home, he goes on a journey to become a real boy, even though throughout the movie, he becomes real on his own.Two-thousand years pass, all the humans are gone, but David is still around. He learns that a race of sub-humans have dabbled into bringing back dead things, but have learned that they'll only be alive for one day. So, his mother is brought back, with no memory of abandoning him or of her husband or of Martin. She just remembers David. Throughout the whole day, they live in the moment of everything. And at night, when his mother goes to sleep, David does to.It's truly a disturbing film by Steven Spielberg from a short story adapted by the late Stanley Kubrick. It made me cry at the end, because of David falling asleep. But, the heart of the film is Do we really love our machinery? Can we really show it love? And if we put a face on them, can they really show emotion? So there's a lot of truth behind it, just sort of dressed up as a drama film. And that's what I liked about it.

How many sequels are like that, in fact, how many sequels even live up to its predecessors. DOOM, with its darker more violent approach, shows the film's aim for difference. For most parts, it succeeded very well, I see no reason why a simple change of pace could go wrong.

Indy and gang end up trying to save the village, as well as fighting against a wily bunch of evil worshipers and an evil cult leader (Amrish Puri). And much like the first film, director Steven Spielberg has tons of fun with special effects and action sequences, and we're guaranteed to join in the fun.The new screenwriters here in DOOM, Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck, lack the true edge of the original screenwriters of the first film, Phil Kaufman and Lawrence Kasdan. But the result is still a fun film, a fast-paced excursion filled with dazzling inventiveness and creative imaginations.

It's so good that even Steven King's usual pulp horror script can't undo it.From the opening scenes of an insignificant Volkswagon beetle snaking up the deserted road towards an old fortress-like hotel, with an ominous, electronic Dies Irae providing the accompaniment, we know we're in some strange territory. At the wheel of that tiny car is Jack Nicholson who is about to be hired as the winter caretaker of the Hotel Overlook. He brings his family, goggle-eyed but beautiful Shelley Duval, and his cute little son along to keep him company while he does his minimal manual chores and tries to write the great American novel. Things begin to go wrong. The echo of things past begins to make itself heard. Nicholson goes berserk, kills a good Samaritan (Scatman Crothers) with an ax and hunts down his wife and child. Duval manages to reach the snow cat, the only vehicle that can travel through the monstrous snowfall that has isolated them. Nicholson chases little Danny through an intricate maze of thirteen-foot-high hedges, howling and lugging his bloody ax. Danny outwits him, escapes with Duval, and Nicholson is finally left to freeze to death in the middle of the insoluble maze, a more cinematic ending than the novel's boiler room.The hotel is a stage set in England and so is the exterior. But what a set it is. It comes across not at all faked but rather like stylized reality. Kubrik does a fine job. The natural tendency in a spooky horror movie would be to hurry the pace so as not to bore the audience of impatient teens. But Kubrik takes his time. The first hour does little more than introduce us to the characters, just enough information to pique us. The shock scenes are not sprinkled throughout the film but are built up to as logically as possible. Threats don't lurk in the shadows. Everything is visible. And the scenes are sometimes funny. The camera views Crother's TV through his bare feet as he lies in bed, under the portrait of a naked babe with an Afro the size of a medicine ball. His camera placement is original. Often the scenes are brightly lighted and the characters seem to be without makeup and the conversational pauses and hesitations stretched out to the horizon, a self-imposed directorial challenge.And an acting challenge too. Jack Nicholson has been in better films but his performance here has never been topped. There are some long takes during which he speaks to Loyd, the ghostly bartender, while looking directly into the camera. He delivers a superlative slice of ham here and elsewhere, winking, wriggling his tongue at his wife, snorting, making gargoyle faces, acting stupefied. What a performance. Everybody else is good, too, if not quite at Nicholson's level, but of course he has by far the juiciest part.The story is so full of holes that it's hardly worth bothering with them. Something strange happens to Nicholson, let's say. A beautiful naked woman approaches him in one of the hotel's rooms and smooches him while turning into a rotting corpse. Nicholson screams in horror and runs away. When Duval asks him what happened, he says, Nothing. And if Loyd the bartender is a real ghost, and if the booze is real, and if Nicholson's character is really a recovering alcoholic who has decided to get off the wagon, then why does Jack order just one drink and then wander away to join a supernatural party? Why doesn't he say, Loyd, give me something simple -- a bottle of bourbon and a straw. But suppose Nicholson is hallucinating the ghosts? Well, that can't be, either. One of them unlocks the door to the food storage room and lets Nicholson out. And Shelley Duval and little Danny see them too.This doesn't really torpedo the movie. It has too many superlative features to be destroyed. The holes are irritants but not lethal. A good deal of talent was lavished on this lowbrow script. See it if you can. ","genre":null},{"date":"21 May 2008","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" The photography is exquisite, the score insinuating, the direction unblemished, and the acting sumptuous. It's so good that even Steven King's usual pulp horror script can't undo it.From the opening scenes of an insignificant Volkswagon beetle snaking up the deserted road towards an old fortress-like hotel, with an ominous, electronic Dies Irae providing the accompaniment, we know we're in some strange territory. At the wheel of that tiny car is Jack Nicholson who is about to be hired as the winter caretaker of the Hotel Overlook. He brings his family, goggle-eyed but beautiful Shelley Duval, and his cute little son along to keep him company while he does his minimal manual chores and tries to write the great American novel. Things begin to go wrong. The echo of things past begins to make itself heard. Nicholson goes berserk, kills a good Samaritan (Scatman Crothers) with an ax and hunts down his wife and child. Duval manages to reach the snow cat, the only vehicle that can travel through the monstrous snowfall that has isolated them. Nicholson chases little Danny through an intricate maze of thirteen-foot-high hedges, howling and lugging his bloody ax. Danny outwits him, escapes with Duval, and Nicholson is finally left to freeze to death in the middle of the insoluble maze, a more cinematic ending than the novel's boiler room.The hotel is a stage set in England and so is the exterior. But what a set it is. It comes across not at all faked but rather like stylized reality. Kubrik does a fine job. The natural tendency in a spooky horror movie would be to hurry the pace so as not to bore the audience of impatient teens. But Kubrik takes his time. The first hour does little more than introduce us to the characters, just enough information to pique us. The shock scenes are not sprinkled throughout the film but are built up to as logically as possible. Threats don't lurk in the shadows. Everything is visible. And the scenes are sometimes funny. The camera views Crother's TV through his bare feet as he lies in bed, under the portrait of a naked babe with an Afro the size of a medicine ball. His camera placement is original. Often the scenes are brightly lighted and the characters seem to be without makeup and the conversational pauses and hesitations stretched out to the horizon, a self-imposed directorial challenge.And an acting challenge too. Jack Nicholson has been in better films but his performance here has never been topped. There are some long takes during which he speaks to Loyd, the ghostly bartender, while looking directly into the camera. He delivers a superlative slice of ham here and elsewhere, winking, wriggling his tongue at his wife, snorting, making gargoyle faces, acting stupefied. What a performance. Everybody else is good, too, if not quite at Nicholson's level, but of course he has by far the juiciest part.The story is so full of holes that it's hardly worth bothering with them. Something strange happens to Nicholson, let's say. A beautiful naked woman approaches him in one of the hotel's rooms and smooches him while turning into a rotting corpse. Nicholson screams in horror and runs away. When Duval asks him what happened, he says, Nothing.

Along the way their biggest challenge will be fighting the religious crazed Nazis plus add in dodging booby-traps, and staring down deadly snakes. This film scene after scene is a thrill ride a true cliffhanger of adventure and joyful excitement.
