It's fair to say that none of them have disappointed me - except Jackie Brown, but I'll moan about that if and when I review it- and True Romance is absolutely no exception!I loved this film, fair and square. But what's so intriguing about it is that it's unlike any of Tarantino's other films...maybe that's because he didn't direct, he only wrote it, and it is slightly lovy dovy - not something I would expect from Quentin! Most of the soundtrack is songs I would never really expect to hear in one of Q.T's flicks (espically the song that's played almost every time someone has an intimate conversation) and a lot of the cast I just would never expect to see in association with him. That may sound a little negative but come on, ask yourself, before you heard of this film, did you really expect to see Gary Oldman in a Tarantino movie...I don't think so! Having said this though, when you listen to some of the dialogue, you can instantly tell it's Q.T's words. I don't really know how to explain it but, you'll know what I mean. Oh and Samuel L. Jackson makes a short appearance too!One of the things that attracted me to this movie was the cast. Gary Oldman (one of my fav's), Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. I'll be honest, I have never seen a Christian Slater movie (other than Robin Hood, but I don't count that as a Slater movie) and I wasn't really all that fussed about seeing him, but I tell you, he just really sits right with Tarantino's screenplay. Of course, I don't really think he was the only actor that could have cast has Clarence, but he shone none the less. Once more, I felt that he really made a proper connection with Patricia Arquette, or rather Alabama - the love interest. Christian and Patricia are the stars of the film and are in pretty much every scene, but all of the other big names get a maximum of 2 scenes - though I think Dennis Hopper had 3. This may come has a bit of a downer to those of you who are looking to see your favourite actor, but don't be disappointed - remember, Anthony Hopkins stole Silence of the Lambs and he was only in it for 15 minutes! Gary Oldman's performance was utterly staggering and slightly frightening; not only was he in a film I didn't him to be in, but he was also playing a role I could never have imagined him as. He plays...wait for it...a pimp who thinks he's black! Who'd of thought Commissioner Gordon could pull that off? The one scene that Christopher Walken is in, and I mean ONE, is one of my favourite parts of the film. Chris just reels you in when he says I'm the Anti-Christ in his very thick accent! Now, I really enjoy Val Kilmer's films (don't ever mention Batman Forever to me though, that film just makes me weep) and I was looking forward to him playing another one of these amazing cameos, but the credits rolled and I just couldn't for the life of me remember seeing him and I'm sure that those of you who watch this film, and don't watch Val on a loop, will feel the same way. I looked at his name in the credits and it says he plays a character called Mentor and I had no I idea who the hell he was. But, then it hit me, there are two scenes in the film where Clarence (Slater) is MENTORED by his hero, Elvis Presley, and when looked back at those scenes I thought that Elvis did sound quite a bit like Val's character in Tombstone.

It might seem like a pretty simple film, but Richard Linklater managed to create a unique and special relationship between these two characters thanks to a great script and an incredible chemistry between the two lead performers. Linklater co-wrote the script with Kim Krizan and every single dialogue in this film felt completely real and authentic. This is a very special movie that might seem simplistic but is really complicated because it's difficult to maintain the audience's attention in a film where two characters are speaking to each other without anything actually happening. The real climax and suspense in this film is seeing how time is running out for these characters and knowing this is probably the only night they will get to share together. Anyone who has gone out alone with another couple knows that it can be very boring spending time with them, but you never feel this way about Jesse and Celine because their conversations are so interesting that one wouldn't mind spending time with them and just observing how they interact with each other. That is how I felt about this authentically romantic film.Jesse (Ethan Hawke) is a young American tourist in Europe who has been traveling across Europe in train. His next stop is Vienna where he will spend the night and take the morning plane back home. Celine (Julie Delpy), a young French woman is returning on the same train from visiting her grandmother. Jesse and Celine exchange glances and begin flirting with each other. When the train arrives at Vienna, Jesse convinces Celine to get off the train with him and spend the night sightseeing. She agrees and the film focuses its entire attention on the interaction they have with each other during that night before sunrise while they visit different spots in Vienna. They have some great and deep conversations about love, relationships, and life. They both know this will probably be their only night together, which is a shame because they share a really strong connection together.The film is so brutally honest and authentic that Before Sunrise has become a classic for romanticists everywhere and it inspired two more follow up films by director Linklater. Linklater first came to the attention with his film Slackers and later Dazed and Confused, but his Before trilogy will probably be what he will be remembered for. He has also directed completely different genre films like School of Rock and Bernie. My personal favorite of his is Bernie, but Before Sunrise comes in a close second. I'm all set for Before Sunset now and am thankful I didn't have to wait 9 years to see the resolution of this sweet couple's story. This is a bittersweet movie and it portrays love and relationships in such an authentic way that it stands out as one of the greatest examples of how a romantic film must be made. A few scenes stand out above the rest for me, like the scene where Celine and Jesse have an imaginary conversation with each other as if they were talking to their best friends about their adventure (some important plot points are explained here as to why Jesse was in the train and why Celine agreed to get off with him), and the scene where Jesse makes fun of Celine for believing in the fortune teller's words.

I just love the inner battle between two of the best child actors of the 1990's. Both, Macaulay Culkin and Elijah Woods are wonderful in the roles, they play in this film. Some critics might hate this movie because of the controversy of having the 1990's Home Alone play such an evil role. I didn't mind, because it's shows how great Macaulay Culkin can act. Who knew that the Home Alone kid could be so creepy? And the horrid part is that he looked so natural playing a scheming, serial-killing kid. Directed by Joseph Ruben, the movie starts with 12-year-old Mark Evan (Elijah Wood) having to move to Maine to stay with his Uncle Wallace (Daniel Hugh Kelly) and Aunt Susan (Wendy Crewson) after one of his parents has die, and the other is on an oversea trip. While, there he meets with their son, Henry (Macaulay Culkin). They slowly become good friends, but after a series of sinister acts by Henry, Mark starts to question their friendship as he thinks that Henry might be more dangerous than what he seems. Too bad, that none of the adults believe him. Elijah Wood is just amazing actor when he was younger. He is a winner early on in his career and the proof is in this role. His eyes convey such fear and concern that you really feel his performance is for real. The two stars have great chemistry together. They work with each other so well, I thought this story could have been a real life story. Trust me, why the movie might not seem real. I heard news stories of very evil children doing awful things to each other, without the adults knowing. So it's not so far fetch like some critics panned it to be. The settling in Maine, makes it seem like the movie was written by Stephen King. Surprising it wasn't. A tie-in novel was published alongside the movie's release in 1993, written by Todd Strasser. That explain more about Henry's backstory. The book also concludes differently from the movie that interesting to read. The screen writing by Ian McEwan might be a bit over the top and pretty exaggerated in the film. Even if a child is a sociopath, it still has a child's vocabulary, intelligence, etc. Just being a sociopath doesn't mean you sound like Hannibal Lecter right from the womb. Also, they tend to master the art of acting and sounding normal, which is how they make their way through life without people cluing in. Granted Henry is pretty young and may not have learned those skills yet, but this movie really stretches reality with how obviously unsettled he is and the fact that even people trained to recognize a disturbed child can't see him. The actions he did doesn't seem too far from what an evil child might have done. It's hammed up, but it's no different from any other evil bad seed film like 2009's Orphan and 1956's Bad Seed. Yes, the film was inappropriate for children, but it never was for kids. It's a thriller, and a scary movie. So for Robert Ebert to call the film a creepy, unpleasant experience. I think the movie did its purpose. It's not supposed to make you feel lovely, it's a horror movie. I don't understand why people think this movie is any different than other horror films. At less, this horror movie was smart. I love the final action scene at the end of the cliffs. In my opinion, it's one of my favorite fight scenes in the 1990s. It's get more intense, when a hard choice was given to one of the main characters. I wouldn't spoil it for you. The music by Elmer Bernstein was chilling and works for the intense moments. In my opinion, this R film isn't that bad. Yes, it has children fighting, harsh language, and smoking, but it's not as gory as 1984's Children of the Corn, and 1976's the Omen. This movie could had been rated PG-13 with a few edits. The DVD transfer is good. So it's worth finding this movie, it's has a lot of DVD extras worth checking out. Overall This film isn't for the faint of heart conservative watchers. You have to open to anything, even if it's seems odd for a child to act this way. Once you get pass that, you will realize that this movie isn't as bad as what some critics say it is. You find yourself, cheering Elijah Wood on with this thriller as the story takes you in. You find out that the film is badly overlook and panned by critics just angry because at the time Culkin was American darling at the time and they believe that he shouldn't play a bad seed at the time. It's like watching 1930's horror movie with Shirley Temple as an evil daughter. People are just typecasting the child actor to only family friendly roles. The Good Son is a rare gem of a horror movie that needs to be check out again. It's a good movie, and it's good enough for me.

Directed by Joseph Ruben, the movie starts with 12-year-old Mark Evan (Elijah Wood) having to move to Maine to stay with his Uncle Wallace (Daniel Hugh Kelly) and Aunt Susan (Wendy Crewson) after one of his parents has die, and the other is on an oversea trip. While, there he meets with their son, Henry (Macaulay Culkin). They slowly become good friends, but after a series of sinister acts by Henry, Mark starts to question their friendship as he thinks that Henry might be more dangerous than what he seems. Too bad, that none of the adults believe him. Elijah Wood is just amazing actor when he was younger. He is a winner early on in his career and the proof is in this role. His eyes convey such fear and concern that you really feel his performance is for real. The two stars have great chemistry together. They work with each other so well, I thought this story could have been a real life story. Trust me, why the movie might not seem real. I heard news stories of very evil children doing awful things to each other, without the adults knowing. So it's not so far fetch like some critics panned it to be. The settling in Maine, makes it seem like the movie was written by Stephen King. Surprising it wasn't. A tie-in novel was published alongside the movie's release in 1993, written by Todd Strasser. That explain more about Henry's backstory. The book also concludes differently from the movie that interesting to read. The screen writing by Ian McEwan might be a bit over the top and pretty exaggerated in the film. Even if a child is a sociopath, it still has a child's vocabulary, intelligence, etc. Just being a sociopath doesn't mean you sound like Hannibal Lecter right from the womb. Also, they tend to master the art of acting and sounding normal, which is how they make their way through life without people cluing in. Granted Henry is pretty young and may not have learned those skills yet, but this movie really stretches reality with how obviously unsettled he is and the fact that even people trained to recognize a disturbed child can't see him. The actions he did doesn't seem too far from what an evil child might have done. It's hammed up, but it's no different from any other evil bad seed film like 2009's Orphan and 1956's Bad Seed. Yes, the film was inappropriate for children, but it never was for kids. It's a thriller, and a scary movie. So for Robert Ebert to call the film a creepy, unpleasant experience. I think the movie did its purpose. It's not supposed to make you feel lovely, it's a horror movie. I don't understand why people think this movie is any different than other horror films. At less, this horror movie was smart. I love the final action scene at the end of the cliffs. In my opinion, it's one of my favorite fight scenes in the 1990s. It's get more intense, when a hard choice was given to one of the main characters. I wouldn't spoil it for you. The music by Elmer Bernstein was chilling and works for the intense moments. In my opinion, this R film isn't that bad. Yes, it has children fighting, harsh language, and smoking, but it's not as gory as 1984's Children of the Corn, and 1976's the Omen. This movie could had been rated PG-13 with a few edits. The DVD transfer is good. So it's worth finding this movie, it's has a lot of DVD extras worth checking out. Overall This film isn't for the faint of heart conservative watchers. You have to open to anything, even if it's seems odd for a child to act this way. Once you get pass that, you will realize that this movie isn't as bad as what some critics say it is. You find yourself, cheering Elijah Wood on with this thriller as the story takes you in. You find out that the film is badly overlook and panned by critics just angry because at the time Culkin was American darling at the time and they believe that he shouldn't play a bad seed at the time. It's like watching 1930's horror movie with Shirley Temple as an evil daughter. People are just typecasting the child actor to only family friendly roles. The Good Son is a rare gem of a horror movie that needs to be check out again. It's a good movie, and it's good enough for me.

What emphasized those opinions were gruesome images along with its Gothic tone. A year later, New World Pictures released Hellraiser II Hellbound (1988) and although it wasn't as critically praised, it still resonated with many fans. I found it enjoyable but the writing was much weaker than I had expected it to be. Then, jump four years later and we get Hellraiser III Hell on Earth (1992), which to many just didn't satisfy and bordered on the edge of really bad. The sad thing is that, it is bad, even with the few good things it has going for it.The plot is about a down on their luck news reporter, Joey (Terry Farrell), who can't find a decent story to save her career. That is, until she comes into contact with the lament configuration after watching a hospital patient's head explode. Amazingly after being okay with such a traumatizing experience, this intrigues her more to find out what this tiny puzzle box is all about. To do this, she digs into the past using archives from Dr. Channard's mental asylum and interview footage of Kirsty Cotton. It is also explained to why Pinhead is back in this movie because in the movie before, he was killed off. This is one of the better parts, at least when it comes to the back-story and continuity. Peter Atkins, the same writer of Hellraiser II Hellbound (1988), wrote the screenplay. I'll admit, it's very much appreciated that Atkins' is keeping the continuity straight. If that wasn't at least on track, my rating would probably be lower. But even so, Atkins' ability to give explanations to why this mystical puzzle box decides to make various humans cenobites, and others not, makes no sense. Is it just by random chance? The cast on the other hand is another bowl of mixed nuts. It's great to see that the casting department had Ashley Laurence come back for a small cameo in the asylum footage and of course Doug Bradley as Pinhead himself. That was great, but the main lead, Terry Farrell wasn't. Farrell just didn't make her character come off as a strong female lead, no matter how many times one says Go to hell!.Unfortunately, dialog is another problem. I don't know what Atkins was thinking when it came to dialog, but almost every character here (and maybe even a little bit of Doug Bradley's lines) all have this sarcastic if not watered down dialog that makes them sound like these lines were written for a bad comedy. The Hellraiser franchise is not a comedy, not even a dark comedy, so why are characters making bad puns or being overly sarcastic? Even some of the new cenobites have corny dialog. For example, any female besides Joey (Farrell) wasn't that smart in speech or actions. What's up with that? It wasn't necessary then and it isn't now.Let's not forget though, this is a horror franchise so there will be plenty of death, blood and ugly images. And for those who wish to see that, yes, you will get your eye full worth without a doubt. But, if you're the viewer looking for the same kind of tone and chills you felt from Hellraiser (1987), it won't be found here. Even more surprising is how absent Randy Miller's score to the film was. I was actually impressed with his work from both Darkman II The Return of Durant (1995) and Darkman III Die Darkman Die (1996) because he not only made sure he stuck to the original theme, but added some unique tracks to them as well. Here however, right from the intro credits is Christopher Young's music! It's not to say Miller didn't provide anything, because I know there were tunes in there I never heard before but it seemed like most of the music was just recycled and edited. It's sad when a composer comes off as sounding lazy &#x96; especially if they aren't that bad to begin with. It's not to say this movie doesn't pull through, but its original tone and atmosphere of the picture no longer exists which makes it depressing that a franchise so likable is beginning to lose its charm. It's beginning to get to a point where the only reason why someone would want to watch this is for Pinhead alone. But Doug Bradley can't carry this picture by himself. Otherwise it would've worked from the first installment.The third entry is much lighter in atmosphere and doesn't carry itself the way the first two did. The continuity is thankfully kept in order but the dialog isn't too clever and the only real character that's worth a watch is Pinhead himself.

For an 1981 movie with werewolves, indeed it is good, but it has that feel of a money grabbing movie studio doing an adaptation after a money grabbing publisher selling books of a certain type. You've all read those books somewhere in a small American town, where everybody knows each other and there is dark secret, a city dweller comes to shake up the status quo. Probably Americans read a lot of these books, but I've had it up to my furry neck and my pointy teeth with this kind of bull. It is boring, pretentious and most of the time rehashing similar stories that were probably good when they were written but have now dissolved into lameness.Bottom line I am sure I have seen this movie before, when I was young, but except the scene at the end, which had its share of drama and societal satire, I did not remember one thing while watching it again now. It is a mostly forgettable movie, with unsympathetic characters and a rushed story so that it can cover the entire book. Yes, indeed, take the story, make it a miniseries in the style of Stephen King adaptations and add some decent acting and special effects, and it would do great today, but this film just feels... wrong.

I would fault the movie somewhat because during the first half hour (of 101 minute film) you may find yourself struggling to grasp what the movie is really about (although, since I had seen it before and read about it, I knew...but I still think the first 30 minutes meanders around quite a bit with no clear destination, although that's not to say it's not intriguing.

It's interesting how many references to homosexuality there are in this film...and that they got away with some of them. First, Peter Lorre's character is clearly effeminate, both with his behaviors and his gardenia scented calling cards. In an early scene, Bogart says to a male detective of his male partner, What's your boyfriend getting at, Tom? And later, when Bogart slaps a thug, When you're slapped, you'll take it and like it. But the reason this film is sooooooo good is the acting. Although he had already been in films from 1928 - 1940, 1941 was really the year that Humphrey Bogart came into his own right as a true star, rather than a supporting actor. And it was in this film, in my view, that he showed what would be a fairly common theme throughout the rest of his career -- a good guy who was just a shade away from being a bad guy. As Sam Spade, that persona worked well, and continued to work well for Bogart in any number of pictures. The female lead -- Mary Astor -- is perfect here as a woman who is acting an evolving part in a never-ending comedy of errors; you can see she's not to be trusted, although superficially she seems highbrow, while underneath she's really a con.Gladys George, who surprisingly gets third billing, is rather irrelevant to the story as Bogart's partner's wife.

Barton MacLane is around as a detective, but his acting is always pretty static. Lee Patrick is enjoyable here as Bogart's secretary.Surprisingly way down at 7th billing is Sydney Greenstreet as the fat man; but this was his first film...and he turned it into a gem of a role with his evil giggling; interesting to watch his early scenes here where he is filmed sitting and you see him at an odd angle from the belly up.I've always thought that Ward Bond was an underrated actor. Here as a police detective he gets better screen time. Jerome Cowan, as Bogart's detective partner doesn't last long...killed off within minutes of the beginning of the film. Of special note here is Elisha Cook, as Wilmer, an effeminate gangster (?) who plays it too tough only to be put down repeatedly by Bogart...a very good role for him. Interestingly, John Hamilton is around as the DA (he later played Perry White in television's Superman series. And you have to watch carefully for the ship's captain, who turns out to be Walter Huston, director John Huston's father, in an uncredited cameo.The bottom line of this film is the old saying that there is no honor among thieves.

The Fog tells the story of the 100 year anniversary of the small coastal California town of Antonio Bay and as the town prepares for it's centennial celebration, a dark secret is revealed. Legend has it a leper colony paid the founders of Antonio Bay a lot of gold to let them settle nearby but, they were betrayed and murdered as their ship was lured into the rocks to crash and sink. All were lost but, now a horde of vengeful spirits returns from the sea, wrapped in a surreal fog, to make the descendants of those who wronged them pay with their lives. The Fog focuses not on a main character but, a group of central characters whose individual experiences during this supernatural crisis bring them slowly all together for it's tense and creepy final act set in the town church. A good cast, including Jaime Lee Curtis as hitchhiker Elizabeth, Tom Atkins as local fisherman Nick, Janet Leigh as centennial chairwoman Kathy WIlliams and Adrienne Barbeau as single mom and radio DJ Stevie Wayne, give life to this ensemble and make them characters we like and care about so, we fear for them when they are placed in harm's way. Add to that Hal Holbrook as the town's alcoholic priest and a host of Carpenter regulars, with even a cameo by Carpenter himself, and you have a film wonderfully filled with a variety of characters who are all potential victims for the marauding phantoms. And as for those phantoms, lets not forget to mention the ghostly Captain Blake (FX man Rob Bottin) and his vengeful crew who are portrayed with practical FX which makes them quite spooky and gives them a heavy dose of menace and a lot of effectiveness when they are on the attack. There is loads of atmosphere and some very solid scares and suspense created by Carpenter, along with some great cinematography from frequent Carpenter collaborator Dean Cundey, which makes this a good, solid, old fashioned ghost story and a fun Halloween treat. And Carpenter again delivers a score which adds chills and foreboding to his tale of ghostly revenge much like he did for Halloween and he starts the film off perfectly with a chillingly fun opening sequence with veteran John Houseman as a crusty sailor who likes to tell kids scary stories. It sets the mood for the thrills and chills yet to come. Made back when there was no phoney CGI, just solid make up effects from master Rob Bottin (who went on to do The Thing's FX for Carpenter) and some very basic down to earth smoke and mirrors style visuals that are as beautiful as they are scary. A great flick the likes of which they rarely make anymore. One of my must watch flicks during the Halloween season!

But aside from its significance in animated film history, does Lady and the Tramp still hold up well as a movie? In general, that seems to be the case even though some moments are better than others. Lady and the Tramp begins with a happy couple receiving a cocker spaniel puppy for Christmas whom they eventually call Lady. A rather weird name to give a dog, but I digress. Lady is living an enjoyable life with her human owners and her two dog friends in the neighborhood, a Scottish terrier named Jock and a bloodhound named Trusty. On the opposite part of town, a mutt referred to by many as the Tramp (for whatever reason) enjoys living life to the fullest without either an owner or a collar. When these two direct opposites first run into each other, they don't seem to think much of each other (at least Jock and Trusty don't think much of him). But due to various circumstances that Lady undergoes, these two dogs run into each other once more and as they get to know each other with their adventures together, they fall in love.I'll be perfectly frank. I think it's a bit much to have Lady and the Tramp be a love story. In my opinion, I didn't see a credible love story here. I saw a credible story about friendship and getting to know one another instead which would have been far more appropriate in my mind. Just based on the events that occurred within this story, I think that Lady and the Tramp falling in love with each other after all this said and done was a stretch for me. I didn't believe that these two dogs had a plausible romance between each other based on what we were given. The subplot involving Lady's dilemma with her owners expecting a baby doesn't help either. I felt like that subplot which takes up about 20% of this 75-minute picture just wasn't that interesting. I felt like that went on longer than it should have and felt a little tacky overall as proved with the mediocre song What is a Baby\/La La Lu. Speaking of the songs, the other songs including Bella Notte, an excellent romantic song, and He's a Tramp, a nice and jazzy tune, aren't that bad. I thought that the animation design on some of the dogs, particularly Lady and Peg, was successful at giving these dogs human like qualities. Whether it's with expressing their emotions or having some physical similarities to humans, whoever came up with these designs knew what they were doing. Speaking of the characters, they're pretty good, too. Even though the jokes from Jock and Trusty are only so-so, they still have plenty of life to them. I still liked the two main characters even though I couldn't buy that they were in love. They have enough personality to them to work as characters. My favorite characters in this movie oddly enough are the humans, isn't that weird? I liked Lady's owners and how they literally call each other Jim Dear and Darling when talking to each other. You can tell that these two are having a happy marriage based on almost every scene they're in. Tony and Joe, the main chefs from the Italian restaurant where Lady and the Tramp eat spaghetti together (and the film's most famous scene occurs) are awesome, too. Though these guys are only present in one or two scenes, they have enough charisma and charm that they look kind of cool even when they're singing the song Bella Notte to two dogs. If anyone made a scene like that today in live-action where a few people are singing to dogs eating spaghetti, you can bet it would look pretty terrible. But here, it somehow works very well because of the animation and the overall way that scene was handled. In spite of the pet peeves I've stated earlier, Lady and the Tramp is a nice little Disney flick for kids and adults to take a look at for good evening entertainment. Will everyone truly get all of the humor present? I know I didn't get a few of the jokes. Is the story going to work for everyone as it is? Not exactly, but most will get into it anyways. Does it still have plenty of charm in its characters, animation, and music? You bet. I'd say it's worth a couple viewings.

Although Lee had made a splash with his first two great films the Romantic Comedy-Drama She's Gotta Have It and the funny College Comedy-Drama-Musical School Daze,Do The Right Thing in my opinion was his first real breakthrough and even though Spike Lee has made many great and truly wonderful films since none of his other films(with the exception of Lee's other Masterpiece Malcolm X) have left an amazing and powerful impression on viewers like Do The Right Thing had. Right from the opening credits Do The Right Thing pulls you into an amazing unforgettable cinematic experience that keeps you glued to the screen with great intensity and fiery. It's a movie that is very realistic and stylish,funny and tragic,thoughtful and observant,raw and in your face as well as movie that grabs you by the throat and never lets go until the very end. Also Do The Right Thing maybe one of the best and greatest if not the best and greatest film about race and racism in America and with DTRT Spike Lee gives viewers and examination of Racism why most human beings are Racist and Lee doesn't sugarcoat anything and just approaches the Racism with realism and no race or ethnicity in the film Blacks,Whites,Hispanics and Asians goes unscathed. Lee has talked about race in most of his other films and in his other films they were very thought-provoking but DTRT is his most powerful film about race. The talks of Race and Racism is powerful and frank and will leave an great impression on viewers because the themes of racism is timeless. Each of the main characters in the film are real and are very complex and multidimensional and aren't stereotypes but the kind characters that we see in real life and just like in real life there are flesh and true life characters in the film that are likable and unlikable but stay with you after the film is over. What I also love about the film is the fact that DTRT takes place over the course of one day and hot weather and temperature. I love films that take place in one day or in 24 hours and DTRT gives viewers a day in the life in a Brooklyn,New York section neighborhood showing the characters doing regular everyday things but it is slightly distorted with tension in the air and the Hot weather adds to the tension. The 100 plus degree Weather is an accurate representation of not only Heat but the tension among the film's main characters that is boiling and ready to explode like a bomb and it is not the sweat or the heat but with violence and harsh language and Spike Lee puts the high level tension to the forefront and brings it out and never lets up. The beautiful cinematography by Ernest Dickerson is amazing and stylish with Ernest Dickerson making the hot sunlight and heat look great to look at with close ups and weird,tilted angles with amazing visuals making the different colors and styles come off the screen. The screenplay by Spike Lee is very masterful and well-written with Lee giving the characters memorable dialog that is harsh and true to life and each of the main characters come to life thanks to Lee's great uncompromising script. The ending or final 30 minutes of the film is one of the greatest and most unforgettable endings in film history and is an ending that greatly doesn't answer any questions and will cause for a lot of debates with no clear or easy conclusions with Lee letting the viewers make up their own minds. An amazing and powerful ending.The whole cast is amazing. Danny Aiello is excellent as Sal,the local pizzeria owner. Ossie Davis is brilliant as Da Mayor,a drunk with words of wisdom. Ruby Dee is fantastic as Mother Sister,an old woman who watches the entire neighborhood and has great scenes with Davis. John Turturro and Richard Edsen are amazing as Sal's sons Pino,Sal's oldest son who's racist against Blacks and Vito,Sal's youngest who likes Blacks. Giancarlo Esposito is outstanding and over the top as Buggin' Out,a guy protesting Sal's. Spike Lee is great as Mookie,Sal's Pizza delivery guy Bill Nunn is wonderful and iconic as Radio Raheem,a young man who loves his Radio. Paul Benjamin(ML),Franie Faison(Coconut Sid),Robin Harris(Sweet Dick Willie),Rosie Perez(Tina),Joie Lee(Jade),Samuel L. Jackson(Mr. Senor Love Daddy),Miguel Sandoval(Officer Ponte),Rick Aiello(Officer Long),Roger Guenveur Smith(Smiley),Steve White(Ahmad),Martin Lawerence(Cee)Leonard Thomas(Punchy)Christa Rivers(Ella),Steve Park(Sonny),Lois Ramos(Stevie),Frank Vincent(Charlie)and John Savage(Clifton)give good performances as well.The direction by Spike Lee is brilliant and stylish,with Lee always moving the camera and giving the film a beautiful visual style with tilted angles and close-ups. Great direction,Lee.The score by Bill Lee is excellent,powerful,sad and memorable and adds to the film's tone. A wonderful score by Bill Lee. The film has a great soundtrack with songs by Public Enemy(the classic Do The Right Thing Theme Song Fight The Power),Al Jarreau(Never Explain Love),Perri(Feel So Good),Ruben Blades(Tu y Yo),Steel Pulse(Can't Stand It),Teddy Riley Featuring Guy(My Fantasy)and more. Great soundtrack.In final word,if you love Spike Lee,Dramas,or films in general,I highly suggest you see Do The Right Thing,an excellent,brilliant,flawless and unforgettable masterpiece of cinema that will stay with you after you watch it and belongs in every film lovers collection.

It mostly deals with the real world as a setting but it has cartoon characters intermixing with reality. The theme of the film is thought to be clearing Roger's name by Eddie, but the whole story actually revolves around saving Toontown from destruction by Judge Doom. There are a lot of plot twists that the first time through you would not notice that help you see the dots connected. You learn about why Eddie dislikes toons so much as the story goes on. In the end he loses his hatred for toons and avenges his brother's murder by a toon which ends up being Judge Doom's real self a squeaky voiced red eyed evil toon. In the end the bad guy dies Judge Doom and Roger is cleared and Toontown is saved by Roger and Eddie. A film with a similar theme would be Hoodwinked. The fairytale characters are framed for doing something and the movie is about finding out who did it while proving their innocents. The lighting played a big part in leading the theme. When R.K. Maroon was murdered you see the shadow of the gun peeking through the window as it comes through to shoot him the dimness of the lighting adds to the evil feel of it. Then the dark alley as Jessica Rabbit runs off gives you the feeling she might have been the murder and plotter that framed Roger. Throughout the film the lighting helps you know something interesting or important to the progression of the film is coming or is happening. In the end when Toontown is saved, Judge Doom is dead and the Will is found the brightness of Toontown in the background lightens the mood as the film ends leaving you feeling like everything ended the way it should with a HAPPY ENDING.They say you can judge a lot about a film by its title that is more than true in the case of this film the title is the theme all wrapped up in a nutshell. The whole movie is about finding out who framed him and who did the killing and plotting.

Anyway I just got done watching it and loved it! It was way better than I expected. I saw it had a 6.5 before I watched it so I thought it would be good, but it was really good to my surprise. The idea was original and exciting. If you haven't seen it the story is a Special Effects guy is asked by the government to help fake a former Mob members death so the Mob stops going after him. It turns out that wasn't the whole story and Roland(The main character) is in for a wild ride. It keeps you thinking and it actually has a good bit of action.If you have not seen it go watch it, I promise you will like it.

It is, after all, one wonderful story about an obsessed gambler (Frank Sinatra as Nathan Detroit)and another not-as-obsessed gambler (Marlon Brando as Sky Masterson) who want to make a bet on just about anything ever thought of. And so, in New York Nathan Detroit makes a bet with Masterson that he can not take the Salvation Army Sergeant Sarah Brown (played so capably by Jean Simmons)to dinner in Havana. Much to the surprise of both of them, Sky Masterson and Sarah Brown end up falling in love with each other after the dinner date in Cuba. At the same time, Masterson promises the Salvation Army General Cartwright, played by the sometimes-serious-looking Kathryn Givney, that he can keep the Salvation Army mission from an imminent closing by providing several men to attend a midnight prayer meeting thirty-six hours from the present time. But the story does not end there, since something takes place that puts a strain on the relationship of Sky and Sister Sarah. Still, the story is, again, wonderful and heart-warming. Several other actors give support to the movie, such as Regis Toomey as the Salvation Army member Arvaid Abernathy, Vivian Blaine as Sinatra's girlfriend Adelai, B.S. Pully as Big Louie from Chicago, Sheldon Leonard as Harry the Horse, and Stubby Kaye, just to mention a few. Naturally, the Goldwyn Girls add glitter to the movie. Of course too, the musical numbers are entertaining, such as Guys and Dolls, I'll Know when My Love comes Along, and the unforgettable song Luck, Be a Lady tonight. A great story, beautiful color, pretty songs, and an endearing story. A very entertaining movie in many ways.
