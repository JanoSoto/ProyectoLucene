It's all just a series of accidents triggered by an non-present force. It's crafty, campy, and of a different breed. It's smart, stylistic, without being too over-the-top. The only scene I can think of in this film that pushes the limit is the scene where one person is strangled to death. It's clear the screenwriter pondered on how force can strangle someone.This is another horror film where you don't know how to feel when watching it. Tense? Scared? Freaked? Sadistic? Excited? When I saw this film, around the age of seven, I was nothing but amazed. I kept trying to figure out what the hell was making these things fall and what was leading these people to die. When I watched movies, up until around ten, I truly didn't pay attention to any dialog (odd now how I brutally critique films that lack it), I just went along for the ride.Alex Browning (Sawa) is going on a class trip on a red-eye flight to Paris. Just before take-off, Alex has a brutal premonition where the plane explodes, and everyone dies. Upon awakening, Alex, like anyone, is freaked out and his panic causes classmates an orphan Clear (Larter), his bestfriend Tod (Donella), the teacher Ms. Valerie Lewton (Cloke), his rival Carter (Smith), Carter's girlfriend Terry (Detmer) and goof-off Billy (Scott).Sure enough, the plane explodes in a fiery burst killing everyone. Alex, now realizes, he has an unprecedented ability to vision an accident before it occurs. Now, the people who made the lucky attempt to get off, and dodge death, are now killed off one by one in the order they would've died on the plane. The order I won't spoil because they explain it thoroughly (and I mean thoroughly) in the film.Over the years, the dialog in this film has gotten more attention by me. First it was about the deaths, then I listened to information that was around the deaths (like a few minutes before it would happen), then I would go crazy researching the film to get every pinpoint detail on the film before going back to watching it with my undivided attention. I was a mess. I loved the film. I loved every frame of it. Loved its dare to be different style of film-making, and loved every character, even the antagonist bully.There are some movies you can't put a price on and Final Destination is the one for me. Despite its questionable premise, it tackles it in a fantastic, and enjoyable manor. It doesn't get too comical (you can save that for the fourth film), and even though you could see sequels in the film's headlights, you anticipate them to be just as good as the first if the film sticks to its formula, limits its comedy, and has believable, realistic deaths.Starring Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Kristen Cloke, Kerr Smith, Chad Donella, Seann William Scott, Amanda Detmer, and Tony Todd.

Even the panic over the supposed millennium bug can be seen as a millenarian prophecy wearing a secular disguise. It is therefore perhaps appropriate that 1999 was the year which saw Roman Polanski's supernatural thriller The Ninth Gate; it was by no means the only film with a demonic theme to appear in this particular year.Dean Corso, a New York rare-book dealer, is hired by Boris Balkan, a wealthy book collector, to authenticate a book he has recently bought, The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows, a volume of occult lore written by a seventeenth-century Italian author named Aristide Torchia. Torchia was burned at the stake by the Inquisition and surviving copies of his book are extremely rare, although two other copies are known to exist. Legend has it that Lucifer himself acted as Torchia's co-writer and that possession of a genuine copy of the book will enable the owner to conjure up the devil.Balkan has recently acquired his copy of The Nine Gates from another book collector named Andrew Telfer, who committed suicide soon afterwards. Telfer's widow, Liana, wants the book back, claiming it was her property and not her husband's to sell. Corso travels first to Portugal and then to Paris to examine the other two surviving copies, but realises that by accepting Balkan's commission he has put himself in danger as there are persons, possibly including Liana herself, who will do anything to obtain a copy; several persons connected to the book meet violent deaths.Despite the paranormal theme, The Ninth Gate is not a horror film along the lines of The Exorcist or The Omen. (Or, for that matter, Polanski's earlier Rosemary's Baby. Although he has publicly said that he does not believe in the occult, he clearly has an imaginative interest in the theme). There are no ghosts, demons or monsters and no spooky special effects. For much of its length the film resembles more closely a neo-noir thriller with the book acting as what Alfred Hitchcock called the McGuffin, an article of no great importance in itself but which the main characters in the movie are all trying to get hold of. There is a resemblance between Corso and the private detectives who were the heroes of many of the original films noirs. To begin with, the only explicitly supernatural element, apart from the book's subject-matter, is the presence of a mysterious young woman, never named and only referred to as Green Eyes. This woman, played by Emmanuelle Seigner (aka Madame Polanski), acts as Corso's guardian angel (or should that be guardian devil?) and seems to possess powers which go beyond the purely natural.The film has something of the feel of a tale by that Edwardian master of the ghost story, M R James, a feel heightened by the solid period interiors in which much of the action takes place. James's stories often centre upon an artefact (sometimes, indeed, a book) with supernatural powers, the nature of which is gradually revealed as the story develops, and an initially sceptical narrator whose scepticism is replaced by a realisation that the forces which confront him are real. So it proves here. Corso, initially motivated solely by the prospect of a lucrative deal, begins to realise that Balkan, Liana and others may want the book for reasons other than its financial value.Although Johnny Depp can be good in films about the paranormal or the gruesome (From Hell, Pirates of the Caribbean, Sweeney Todd), this is not his best performance. It was a mistake to try and make him look older, as even with greying temples he does not seem convincingly middle-aged, and his acting is flat and uninteresting. (There were reports of artistic clashes between him and the director).The film as a whole, however, is a reasonably good one. Polanski is one of those auteur directors (others include Kubrick and Peter Weir) who try not to repeat themselves and to make every movie as different as they can to its predecessor. (His film prior to The Ninth Gate was Death and the Maiden, a study of the politics of dictatorship in Latin America, and his next two were to be The Pianist, about the Nazi occupation of Poland, and an adaptation of Dickens's Oliver Twist). This film is not only different to Rosemary's Baby but also different to Polanski's previous neo-noir, Chinatown, from 25 years earlier. That film was set during a hot, dry summer and shot in a harsh, glaring Southern California daylight. In The Ninth Gate, by contrast, the colours are darker and more muted; it has an autumnal feel to it, even if the state of the vegetation suggests that it too was filmed in summer.The plot is less complicated than that of Chinatown (or many other neo-noirs) and, although it is at times slow-moving, it never loses the viewer's interest as it moves towards its disturbingly ambiguous conclusion. I would not rate The Ninth Gate quite as highly as Chinatown or some of Polanski's other masterpieces such as Tess or The Pianist, but it is nevertheless an interesting film, proof that it is possible to make a supernatural thriller without resorting to shock tactics. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"10 August 2011","score":"","review":" Although the year 2000 represented nothing more than the 1,999th anniversary of the year in which a sixth-century monk mistakenly believed Christ had been born, the approach of the end of the second millennium was greeted with dire predictions of the end of the world and an upsurge of interest in the occult.

It's a classic and will remain timeless. The thing with Stanley Kubrick films is that after viewing them you seem to view the world sort of differently when you come out of the film. You start to see things from a different point of view when you watch another film. He truly is a one off director and this will remain as one of his best films!One of the best aspects (there are many) about this film is the directing by Stanley. He manages to build up a chilling atmosphere to a masterful affect. He makes us as the viewer seem as isolated as the characters through the ominous tracking shots of the long isolated hallways, the large echoes in the halls and the sublime mountain landscape which almost seems to be devouring them up. It is a truly chilling masterclass in how to direct a horror film! Some scenes create a choking atmosphere and an uncomfortable feeling towards the suspenseful dialogue, it's just genius! Some of the cinematography is beautiful.Also arguably the best aspect is the performance by Jack Nicholson. How did he not win an Oscar? He wasn't even bloody nominated! This will remain as one of the unanswered wonders of the world. The sheer anger of his character shoots through every last inch of him! He puts his heart and soul into the film and makes up for the hilariously bad acting from Shelley Duvall. Poor Shelley, she makes the film seem quite funny when it's obviously not suppose to. Her acting is atrocious and just pretty darn funny! (Something she'd say) but like I said, Jack does more than make up for her weak performance.Stanley's script is great! Instead of just copying the book, he takes the story and makes it his own vision. He leaves more questions to the viewers to answer, making them think and care about the characters. The screenplay is effective, inventive and very tense at times. Most importantly it's suspenseful and makes everything count! He also makes good use of symbolism and could be analysed in a way such greats like Black Swan could be analysed.The Shining is also quite creepy thanks to Stanley's masterful directing. The ominous tracking shots of Danny on his trike, the weird unexplainable images and an atmosphere that really cranks up the terror. If you are a lover of films, then you should be able to appreciate everything that is good in The Shining. Aside from it being exciting and creepy, it's also really well-written and directed to perfection. Go watch!

First, its return on the dollar was among the best ever for any film. While the budget was a very modest $777,777.111 (no kidding), it returned $115,000,000 in the United States alone! No wonder this film made George Lucas famous. Second, it was very innovative. While I was not a huge fan of the film's style, it was unique and sure had an impact on the world as well as future films. No one had made a film like this before--chock full of one song after another blaring across the soundtrack and its odd semi-structureless plot was also quite unique.The film concerns a bunch of young adults just hanging out and cruising. There really isn't a lot more to it than that. Sure, their stories all reveal a bit about them through the course of the film, but most of the characters have no great depth. It's more like you are a voyeur watching some likable and not especially likable kids doing...well...nothing. Now if you grew up in the early 60s and remember all this, then it's a great stroll down memory lane. If you didn't, I think the movie will be more of a tough sell, as the nostalgia angle is non-existent. As for me, I wasn't even born until 1964, so the nostalgia aspect was less--but I loved the music and great cars. My daughter, while less impressed about EVERYTHING did grudgingly say that the music was great. She also said that she pretty much ignored the plot and just listened to the songs! And, perhaps, this is pretty typical of a person from her generation. As for me, the film was mildly interesting and I respect it--though I did not love it. This isn't really meant as a criticism--just a statement about how this film appealed to this 47 year-old guy. For the right audience, it's the perfect film. Otherwise, you might feels it's all a bit overrated.Aside from the nostalgia for the early 60s, the movie also is quite interesting when seen today because so many future stars and super-stars are in it--mostly when they were young unknowns. Ron Howard (a child star but not all that popular yet as an adult), Cindy Williams, Harrison Ford, Richard Dreyfus, Charles Martin Smith, Mackenzie Phillips and Suzanne Somers all appear in the film.

I can try with all of my willpower, but that can't stop me from comparing Tim Burton's interpretation of Batman with Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. I PROMISE I will keep things in perspective and be as fair to Batman as I can. Just know that I'm a youngster and Christopher Nolan's Batman films are what I'm accustomed to. So, these are simply my OPINIONS in black and white. You don't have to agree, I'm just putting them out there. Please don't hate me for having them. And here we ... go! Michael Keaton vs. Christian Bale. This round goes to Mr. Bale by way of total knockout. It's much easier to compare these two Bruce Wayne\/Batmen than the Jokers because the their portrayal isn't radically different. Granted, Bale's Batman is more of an outcast, more of a vigilante than a hero, unlike Keaton's Batman, who ends up a rejoiced symbol. That aside, Batman still has the same birth, if you will, the murder of his parents before his eyes. That is what changed Bruce Wayne. And I think Michael Keaton was a little too timid in his performance to really delve into the psychological aspect of that initiation. He seemed... terrible. His performance as Bruce was very... diluted. Mr. Bale was more erratic and obsessive, he truly captured an edgier side of Mr. Wayne. As far as the role of the Batman, Michael Keaton was fine. Just fine. I missed the guttural voice. Michael Keaton played a stonier Batman, Christian Bale played a more crazed Batman. And it may be due to the suit, but Bale's Batman was a bit more graceful. Jack Nicholson vs. Heath Ledger. Ah, the famous Joker debate. I've wanted in on this for a LONG time. But it's a difficult comparison, the direction of the characters are opposite the spectrum. So I'll tell you which Joker characterization I liked best The Dark Knight's. Ledger's Joker was more obscure, he had no past, no name. And he wasn't, at all, silly. He was an intelligent, lethal, psycho with an OBJECTIVE. He was tormented. He was more realistic. I liked that better than the clown-like Joker we saw in Tim Burton's Batman. Nicholson's Joker was just deranged; his weapons were sophomoric. But he was funnier. All in all, The Dark Knight's Joker wins. As far as Jack and Heath's acting as their Jokers... I think they're on par with each other. Heath Ledger was amazing in The Dark Knight. Period. He made the movie darker, wittier, and a lot more terrifying. Jack Nicholson was also incredible. He was engulfed in lunacy, dancing and grinning with gusto and charisma. And just because I lean more toward Ledger's side in this epic battle, I still love Jack Nicholson. He was a great Joker, and he is a very talented actor. I couldn't think of anyone else to portray Tim Burton's Joker, it was his Joker. Alfred. Michael Caine wins. No argument. He was a wiser, more compassionate, stable figure for Bruce. Michael Caine's Alfred is a real story component.Burton's Gotham. Tim Burton... I love his vision. His movies always have an eerie, Halloween quality that is very stylized, and this movie was no exception. The city was creepy, burned looking. Ruined, terrified. It was great. Burton had HIS exclusive vision of Gotham, and he saw it to fruition. The execution of his Gotham was, again, level with Nolan's sleek, corrupted Gotham. The plot. Eh, I didn't like it. At all, to be honest. I'm used to a sophisticated Batman, and this was a bit ridiculous. The flying Bat-plane had me face palming. The Joker's origin was just plain asinine... Jack Napier falling into radioactive fluid. Really? Being shot is one thing. But surviving radiation is a bit of a stretch. Tainting the cosmetics was interesting. Just... weird. And the love story. Don't get me started. I strictly believe in a movie like this, romance should take second place to action; I felt like Michael Keaton was more often Bruce Wayne than he was Batman. The Bat mobile was a little cheesy looking. But I said I'd be fair, it looked good for its time. The Tumbler is just cooler. As for the plot twist, this means more spoilers I HATED IT! Jack Napier being Bruce's parents' killers! It was like writers were looking for a good Batman-Joker confrontation outlet, it was bad. And the fact that Jack had pointed the gun at Bruce, and then just decided, never mind. And the whole idea would have been better if Michael Keaton had played up Batman's anger if Batman had REACTED! The ending. Again, a total opposite from The Dark Knight. As I mentioned previously, Tim Burton's Batman ended up the hero. Which wasn't so much bad as it was predictable. I wanted to like this movie more; I have high expectations for Batman, and I'm a huge Batman fan. I just don't think all the elements were there, even with the story it presented. It seemed to me to be the rough draft of a potentially cool Batman movie, and I say this without The Dark Knight in mind. Some things about this film were pinpoint, others fell flat. Which is why, I give this movie a 5\/10. Feel free to disagree. Thanks for reading!

The alien is quite harmless until provoked, and everything it does is in self-defense. Its ship is destroyed, it is shot at, attacked by huskies, burned and electrocuted. Poor thing. Obviously the film is a not-so-subtle commentary on reactionary United States politics and cowboy diplomacy. The soldiers shoot first and ask questions later, with disastrous effects.

The narrative is non-linear, making vivid use of flashback inter cut with the unfolding of the film's climax, creating a dreamy, hypnotic atmosphere, laced with menace, oppression and tension.Many of Bertolucci's films explore politics 'The Conformist', on the surface, is an obvious indictment of Fascism, using imagery, metaphor, irony and gallows humour to mercilessly expose its flaws while always retaining a sincerity and honesty in exploring how Fascism managed to function and progress.The film could have been heavy handed, juggling such a massive topic with other secondary themes; but Bertolucci's success lies in the fact that he never wanders from the character of Marcello Clerici (played wonderfully by Jean-Louis Trintignant)and his personal strive for 'normality' - an ideal that Bertolucci with great care and precision shows to be misguided in its very concept for what is normality? By concentrating on one specific storyline - that of Clerici's mission to assassinate his old professor, who is in self-imposed exile in Paris and engaging in anti-Fascist activities, Bertolucci manages to examine Fascism in more depth and with more success than any 'epic' biography of Hitler or historical drama.It has to be the sign of a great director, then, that this is achieved at the same time as making a masterpiece of cinematic technique - and accolades here must also be shared with Vittorio Storaro, the cinematographer. His palette - of vivid, artificial blues, blacks, harsh whites, yellows, browns, and in the opening scene alone, neon red, makes for a visual feast so sumptuous that in a restored print, 'The Conformist' is breathtaking to behold. But unlike other films that boast beautiful cinematography for its own sake, here, even these opulent colours are used as extensions of theme and character.Much has been written about Marcello Clerici, but it is undoubtedly Anna Quadri, played to perfection by Dominique Sanda, that is the great enigma of 'The Conformist'. What are her intentions? Her motivations? Why does she do the things she does? At times, she seems perfectly sincere a vehement anti-Fascist who loves her husband and is disgusted by the far-right. I believe these ideals to be sincere. But Anna Quadri is a complex, mysterious character. Marcello notices that she resembles a prostitute he met earlier when receiving new orders concerning his old professor, Anna's husband. We notice the resemblance too &#x96; and also realise that she appears similar to yet another prostitute earlier in the film, whom a Fascist government official was toying with on his desk. It is ridiculous to suggest that Anna Quadri could possibly be either of these two women, but the resemblance was obviously meant to be noticed. It throws us off guard the moment we meet Anna; she is impetuous, dangerous, sphinxlike.That she is playing games with Marcello, we have no doubt. Anna admits that she knew from the get-go (along with her husband) that Clerici was a Fascist spy. She is trying to trap him, to entice him, and persuade him to forsake his mission. Her husband uses small tricks and political speeches; she uses sex and emotional blackmail. That she is a ballet teacher is quite apt - she is a master of pose, performance, and seduction, and she knows it.Marcello, of course, is the conformist of the title. This is his story and his tragedy; his speeches revealing his motivations and his confessions could have been written by a 21st century Shakespeare, in that they have a surface lucidity concealing beneath them universes of anguish and desperation. What impact have his parents had on his character? His sexual trauma at thirteen years old? What about Quadri leaving for Paris while the young Marcello was writing his thesis - he seems quite angry about this? Every scene in 'The Conformist' is lovingly realised and brought to the screen - together, Bertolucci and Storaro fill the shot with an abundance of detail, paying particular attention to the cold, impersonal geometry of Fascist architecture, the apartments of the middle classes and the mansions of the upper classes. Bertolucci proves his love for film in his references and homages to his heroes, the directors of the French New Wave (particularly Truffaut, Godard and Resnais) among others these can be seen especially in the camera work and editing - the odd angles (reminiscent of Reed's 'The Third Man') as Marcello walks to his mother's decaying mansion, a painting fading into the scene it depicts, an amazingly inventive and tense chase through wintry woodland using a hand-held camera, accentuating the sound of a gun shot in contrast to the muted sounds of knives in an assassination vividly reminiscent of Shakespeare's 'Julius Caesar'.My favourite scenes include Professor Quadri giving a speech to Marcello, heavily making use of metaphor to explain the workings of Fascism, accompanied with some inspired symbolic imagery involving a shadow on the wall dissolving in sunlight, the party of the 'blind' - an obvious pun by Bertolucci to imply the blindness of Fascism itself, and an amazing sequence in a dance hall later on which emphasises Marcello's role as an outsider. It is ironic to think that the more he tries to conform, the more he distances himself from society and falls deeper into isolation. As the film ends, and he peers behind him into the darkness, Italy's future after the fall of Mussolini murky and uncertain, Marcello is left angry, guilty and scared; but more than that, because of his flawed, doomed plight for 'normality', he is left desperately, painfully alone.

The narrative is non-linear, making vivid use of flashback inter cut with the unfolding of the film's climax, creating a dreamy, hypnotic atmosphere, laced with menace, oppression and tension.Many of Bertolucci's films explore politics 'The Conformist', on the surface, is an obvious indictment of Fascism, using imagery, metaphor, irony and gallows humour to mercilessly expose its flaws while always retaining a sincerity and honesty in exploring how Fascism managed to function and progress.The film could have been heavy handed, juggling such a massive topic with other secondary themes; but Bertolucci's success lies in the fact that he never wanders from the character of Marcello Clerici (played wonderfully by Jean-Louis Trintignant)and his personal strive for 'normality' - an ideal that Bertolucci with great care and precision shows to be misguided in its very concept for what is normality? By concentrating on one specific storyline - that of Clerici's mission to assassinate his old professor, who is in self-imposed exile in Paris and engaging in anti-Fascist activities, Bertolucci manages to examine Fascism in more depth and with more success than any 'epic' biography of Hitler or historical drama.It has to be the sign of a great director, then, that this is achieved at the same time as making a masterpiece of cinematic technique - and accolades here must also be shared with Vittorio Storaro, the cinematographer. His palette - of vivid, artificial blues, blacks, harsh whites, yellows, browns, and in the opening scene alone, neon red, makes for a visual feast so sumptuous that in a restored print, 'The Conformist' is breathtaking to behold. But unlike other films that boast beautiful cinematography for its own sake, here, even these opulent colours are used as extensions of theme and character.Much has been written about Marcello Clerici, but it is undoubtedly Anna Quadri, played to perfection by Dominique Sanda, that is the great enigma of 'The Conformist'. What are her intentions? Her motivations? Why does she do the things she does? At times, she seems perfectly sincere a vehement anti-Fascist who loves her husband and is disgusted by the far-right. I believe these ideals to be sincere. But Anna Quadri is a complex, mysterious character.

There were plenty of films in 1999 that deserved it more than this. Magnolia, Being John Malkovich, Election, all great films. You could probably sit M. Night Shamylan down in a room and watch Magnolia and he would probably say it was a ton better. And thats because it was.The Sixth sense is a good film, but its another Oscar nominee that just doesn't deserve it. Osment deserved a nomination, and Toni Collette, who was snubbed, would have deserved one too. But the rest is unnecessary. Good, but overrated.B+ ","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"}]
