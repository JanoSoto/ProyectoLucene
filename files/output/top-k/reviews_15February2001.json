Here is a man so complex, even he has a hard time understanding himself.  The Talented Mr. Ripley is the first in a series of five novels featuring Tom and is also the one where he is most confused about himself.  The novel was already adapted into Purple Noon (1960), but now writer-director Anthony Minghella (The English Patient) takes the basic framework of the novel and creates a compelling character study and a skillful thriller.Highsmith's novel Strangers on a Train was made into a film by Alfred Hitchcock, and it is no far stretch to say that Minghella has created a film that Hitchcock would have made if he were still with us.  All of the elements of Hitchcock are there guilt, greed, lust, murder, and more guilt. Yet, Minghella's film is not a second-rate imitation; it's the real thing.The plot starts on a case of mistaken identity.  A ship magnate named Herbert Greenleaf (James Rebhorn) notices Ripley wearing a Princeton jacket and asks if he knows his son, another Princeton graduate.  Ripley had borrowed the jacket and filled in for another man, but this is of no consequence to him.  He says he remembers him, and the father offers Ripley $1,000 to go to Italy and convince the young Greenleaf to return.  How could he pass up that offer?  Ripley, a classical music aficionado, learns that the young Greenleaf is into jazz.  He spends time honing his jazz recognition skills and heads off to Italy.Ripley meets Dickie Greenleaf, played with the perfect amount of charisma and falseness by Jude Law, and his longtime girlfriend (Gwyneth Paltrow). After the pleasantries, Ripley makes mention of his jazz knowledge, and Dickie suddenly becomes interested.  A friendship blooms.Ripley has never really had a friend before, so this relationship is taken very seriously on his part.  In fact, it may be misconstrued as a homosexual attraction.  There are definitely some appropriate homo-erotic undertones to the relationship, but Ripley is too much of a human vacuum to take notice. Ripley is more enamored with the idea of Dickie than with Dickie himself. Tom admires the man so much, he doesn't even notice what a false person Dickie is.When Dickie's girlfriend and friend come between Dickie and Tom, Tom takes much offense to his rejection.  Tom has already impressed the expatriate couple of his impersonation skills, and after a brutal boat scene, Tom puts these talents to the test.Matt Damon stars in a performance worthy of the character of Tom Ripley. He is equally charming and vulnerable while still convincing us of a darker, homicidal side.  It's one of the best performances of the year.  The rest of the cast is equally accomplished.  Law is superb.  Long after his character is gone, his presence still haunts the film.  Paltrow does a nice job of convincing us she believes her boyfriend is a decent man and will eventually return to her.  The chameleon-like Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays Dickie's partner in falseness Freddie Miles, and Cate Blanchett plays a fellow inheritor to family fortune.Minghella's Italy is a creation all its own.  Different locales are mixed together to give a sense of culture and beauty.  It serves as a perfect, contrasting backdrop for the events that will unfold.While Gabriel Yared's score evokes the great Bernard Herrmann (a frequent Hitchcock collaborator), music plays a much more important part in the film. Greenleaf is a jazz enthusiast, and Ripley loves classical music.  Jazz of course depends on improvisation, and we learn that Ripley is a much greater improviser than the stale Greenleaf.  In a film full of grand backdrops and rich characters, it's amazing Minghella would pay attention to such a subtle aspect of the film.  It is the sign a great filmmaker when all the elements are equally important to one's appreciation and interpretation of the film's content.The film opens and closes with a distorted and enclosed picture of Ripley. At one point, Ripley tells a friend he wants to give someone a key to a door that contains the dark parts of himself.  When the door closes on that tormented young man in the final frames, we realize his darkness will prevent anyone from seeing itself.  That paradox is Ripley's ultimate punishment.

Hitchcock had her in mind for the role after she had to quit working on his last film Vertigo.  She was probably the key role here, since she was the one who discovered Norman's terrifying secret.  Tony Award-winning actor Martin Basalm was terrific in his brief appearance as the private detective trying to track Marion down.  John Gavin was ok, but nothing to brag about. Hitchcock made a wise decision in filming the movie in black and white, and made history when he demanded that no one be let into the theater after the movie started in order not to cause confusion.

The Academy Award winning thriller earned ubiquitous critical acclaim, therefore a continuation is nearly incapable of living up  to its standards. To make things worse for the highly anticipated sequel Hannibal, the original film's director and main star bailed out, leaving Ridley Scott (Gladiator) and Julianne Moore (Magnolia) filling their places in the credits. It is hard to imagine how this movie could possibly succeed. But the exceptionally beautiful filmmaking, strong performances, intriguing story, and moody atmosphere provoke more nail-biting moments than most thrillers these days.\tThe story of Hannibal does not compare with The Silence of the Lambs. It replaces tension-filled sequences of psychological terror with scenes featuring some of the most grotesque images and realistic gore to ever make its mark on the big screen. This film relies heavily on the shock factor of such extreme graphic violence, although such content is never excessive or relentless. It has perfect timing. The sheer presence of Anthony Hopkins, in another horrific and career defining performance, often creates enough terror for several movies. Hannibal knows that and frequently gives the character more freedom than he had in he first film. But I am not so sure that is a good thing; is it more terrifying listening to Hannibal Lecter discuss his disgusting actions or to actually see him perform such disturbing behaviors? \tThe film takes place ten years after FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster then, Julianne Moore now) interviewed convicted mass murdering cannibal Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) while searching for another disturbed killer. Present day Clarice is involved with a drug bust shoot-out that leaves many dead. Justice Dept. Official Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta), is about to punish her when she gets a call from a the unrecognizably deformed surviving victim of an attack by Lecter. His name is Mason Verge  (Gary Oldman), a wealthy recluse who asks that Starling be placed back on the case of the Cannibal, who has been on the loose for ten years. \tThe movie investigates a lot more than Clarice's experiences with Hannibal Lecter. The script actually consists of two separate stories, one detailing the revenge scheme of Mason, whom is still angry with Lecter after he caused the removal of his face and partial paralysis. The other takes place in Italy, where an inspector named Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini) is out to claim a multimillion dollar reward for providing authorities with proper evidence leading to the arrest of a local, who turns out to be none other than Lecter himself. Obviously this man does not know what he is in for, and ends up losing his cuts for the money&#133;literally.  \tParallel stories are always interesting, but are easily sidetracked with certain characters and or events. What keeps this movie intriguing is the consistent focus on Lector; everything in the story seems to revolve around him. Then again, Hannibal is also quite pointless because it solves nothing. Without giving away the ending, I will say that we are once again left pondering about Lecter. Most any movie that provokes thoughts is worth seeing, but Hannibal forgets the first film, takes a stand on its own, and once again sets us up for another unnecessary follow-up.\tThe most apparent conflict many audiences with have with Hannibal is the absence of Jodie Foster. Julianne Moore is most definitely a capable and challenging actress, and plays the role of Starling with exuberance and clarity. But Foster is simply better in the role and we miss her dearly. Anthony Hopkins saves the movie; the actor is so intense and grisly in his subtle and classy manner, he once again qualifies as an award nominee. Thank goodness he returned for the role; without Hopkins, Hannibal would be nothing but underdone carnage.

There were things that I liked and things that I didn't like but overall it didn't make a huge impact on me. For the most part, when I sit down to watch a movie the most important thing is entertainment value. The movie could have cheesy lines or law defying stunts but if it entertains me, then it achieves its goal. This movie was like a roller coaster ride that never really delivers on the thrill scale. It hinted it at the beginning but fizzles out and leaves an unsatisfied feeling.The Pledge is about a retiring detective (Jack Nicholson) that takes on a final case that turns out to possess his life. On the day of his retirement, a body is discovered that hints of a serial killing. Detective Black chooses duty over retirement and gets involved. A suspect is apprehended and all the signs point to him being the killer despite Black's doubts but a quick confession and conviction closes the case and puts an end to Blacks insistence that the killer is still loose. Accepting his retirement, Black lies back to a life of fishing but a nagging thought in the back of his mind brings him to reopen the case and pick his investigation where he left off.What can you say about Jack Nicholson? He's a fabulous actor and rarely have I seen him give a poor performance. He doesn't disappoint in the Pledge but the story is weak. Sean Penn has never been a conventional storyteller and although he has some smart twists in this storyline I left feeling rather annoyed. The movie began full of suspense. In fact, Penn teased us with a brilliant opening scene and it filled me with anticipation but as the movie progressed I could feel it slow down and by the time the end came I was disappointed although in a way the ending was interesting from a psychological standpoint.

The movie could have cheesy lines or law defying stunts but if it entertains me, then it achieves its goal. This movie was like a roller coaster ride that never really delivers on the thrill scale. It hinted it at the beginning but fizzles out and leaves an unsatisfied feeling.The Pledge is about a retiring detective (Jack Nicholson) that takes on a final case that turns out to possess his life. On the day of his retirement, a body is discovered that hints of a serial killing. Detective Black chooses duty over retirement and gets involved. A suspect is apprehended and all the signs point to him being the killer despite Black's doubts but a quick confession and conviction closes the case and puts an end to Blacks insistence that the killer is still loose. Accepting his retirement, Black lies back to a life of fishing but a nagging thought in the back of his mind brings him to reopen the case and pick his investigation where he left off.What can you say about Jack Nicholson? He's a fabulous actor and rarely have I seen him give a poor performance. He doesn't disappoint in the Pledge but the story is weak. Sean Penn has never been a conventional storyteller and although he has some smart twists in this storyline I left feeling rather annoyed. The movie began full of suspense. In fact, Penn teased us with a brilliant opening scene and it filled me with anticipation but as the movie progressed I could feel it slow down and by the time the end came I was disappointed although in a way the ending was interesting from a psychological standpoint. From an entertainment point of view, it failed its goal.There is an enormous cast of actors here and all of them accomplished. They all do an incredible job but one in particular stood out. I usually sit and watch the credits to see all the people involved and was very surprised to see Benicio Del Toro had a role. I remember seeing his name at the opening credits but never really noticed him. It wasn't until the end credits that I realized which character he played and was absolutely stunned! He played the character so well that it never occurred to me that it could have been him. He doesn't have a huge role in this movie but after watching it I have to say that it's worth at least the cost of a matinee movie to see his performance.Would I recommend someone to see this movie on full fare? No but it is potentially a good matinee movie. Nicholson is great and Del Toro's performance is scene stealing but the movie on an overall level is not worth full fare.Alan  ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"15 February 2001","score":"13 out of 18 people found the following review useful","review":"  This film was a revelation!

This is an action adventure movie and so Mamet is not trying to make any great philosophical point.

But who cares? This isn't the kind of movie that makes a person expect a brilliant script or spectacular acting, so they can get away with a little cheesiness. The scene early in the film when `Jam' (Sam Huntington) gets tangled up and winds up getting hit in the face with the phone is one of the funniest parts in the movie, despite the fact that it was totally unrealistic. I would normally have no sympathy for someone who didn't just bend their foot a little bit to get the spring off and thereby remove any danger, but I refuse to believe anyone who says that they didn't laugh when that thing pulled him back across the floor. Huntington stole every scene he was in, particularly that side-splitting scene with the phone, as well as a hilarious scene in the classroom when one of his classmates (Beth) tries to tell him that she has a crush on him. Guiseppe Andrews was also very good as Lex, the long-haired rock n' roll fanatic, and James DeBello as Trip fulfilled the early `Cure' type role. Furlong, on the other hand, doesn't seem to be doing so great. Remember how huge he was after Terminator 2? Sure, 90% of all of that hoopla was because the movie was so good, but you have to admit that Eddie delivered a quality performance in that film. Now, in Detroit Rock City, we have him playing a geeky high school kid in 1978 trying desperately to make his way into a KISS concert. I think that he did a god job in this role, but it's the type of role that is a drop in quality for him, at least from the tremendous Terminator 2 days. In Detroit Rock City, there's a scene where Eddie does a strip tease at a male strip club, trying to win money with which to buy tickets, and he reveals to the world that he has grown into the soft physique of a thirteen year old kid. And this is the guy that was on the cover of every teen magazine you could find only a few years ago.Natasha Lyonne appears in the small and fairly unenviable role of a dreaded disco girl, but she fills the role very nicely with her quality acting.

He had other reasons, of course, but the rather tenuous connection has caused a number of people who have seen both movies to ask why Merhige came out of semi-retirement (and a lucrative business designing stage sets and directing creepy videos for Marilyn Manson) to work on a film that's as commercially accessible as Begotten was commercially deadly?The obvious reason that no one seems to have come up with is that Merhige is one of only two living directors who's made a major silent film, and Mel Brooks would have been inappropriate for the material. The less obvious reason is that Merhige's favorite trope, the long repetition cut, makes itself known in this movie. It's far more subtle than it was in Begotten-- no ten-minute shots of robed figures dragging Son of Earth up a hill in this one. But as in Begotten, there are long, loving shots of landscape (and I use the term loosely; the most noticeable shot like this focuses on different parts of the train for a few minutes) with action going on around them that has nothing, really to do with the landscape whatsoever. The juxtaposition is just out-of-kilter enough to add a veneer of disturbance. With the increased action in this film, the viewer is less compelled to focus on the juxtaposition, and thus less disturbed; but for this film, in the back of the mind is enough.Much has been made (and very rightly so) of Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Count Orlok, who takes on the persona of character actor Max Schreck through a shady deal with obsessed film director F. W. Murnau (John Malkovich). Dafoe does a fantastic job not only of playing Count Orlok as a vampire who's forced by his own greed into contact with humans he can't kill, but he also takes the silent-film exaggeration of statement and uses it in a sound film. It's unexpected, and it's wonderful. Dafoe is quite deserving of his Best Supporting Actor nomination, but if you're a betting man, remember that Dafoe was overlooked for his two finest roles (in The Last Temptation of Christ and To Live and Die in L.A.).All the flap over Dafoe's brilliance has unfortunately eclipsed some of the minor performances in the movie which are equally as brilliant, e.g. Udo Kier as the perpetually-stressed producer Albin Grau, Catherine McCormack as the spoiled and bitchy star of the film, Eddie Izzard as her co-star, and Cary Elwes as a replacement cameraman (after the original, played by Ronan Vibert, is sent to the hospital thanks to Orlok's inability to, erm, contain himself) whose arrival on the scene is the catalyst that sets everything in motion.Elwes' role, and the way his arrival changes the dynamic of the film set, is the one piece of this film that elevates it from an amusing, hyperbolic character sketch of a director who will go to any lengths to get his film and a piece of art. While Elwes himself is about as subtle as a cold chisel to the ear, the effects of his coming are masked by his (and those around him) aping until the final scene, when the true implications of the whole mess come to light. The final scene is so beautifully set up, and so well constructed, that the payoff would have been worth any number of errors. Fortunately, we have very few to contend with, most of which have nothing to do with the film itself (the person who composed the main title credits, for example, should be exiled from Hollywood forevermore).As a side note, the actual scenes we see Murnau directing are quite close to the scenes in the original. Given the flights of fantasy used in other parts of the film, this is a detail that could have easily been overlooked, but it wasn't.

However, it is much better than that.Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) is a waif that is constantly seen waiting outside the theater for her idol Margo Channing (Bette Davis).  When Margo's best friend Karen Richards (Celeste Holm) invites her in to meet Margo it begins a relationship that is destined to turn into a typhoon.  Margo is taken in by Eve's hard luck story and her obsequious deference, and she decides to employ her as her personal secretary.  With duplicitous and cunning ambition, Eve maneuvers her way into becoming Margo's understudy. Just turning 40, Margo begins to become self conscious about her age and sees Eve as a threat to her career and her relationship with Bill, who is eight years her junior.  The resulting tension between Margo and Eve is electric, with power plays, blackmail and conniving at every turn.John Mankiewicz was one of the most prolific and gifted auteurs of the studio era.  He won back-to-back double Oscars for directing and screenplay in 1949 and 1950 for `Letters to Three Wives' and `All About Eve'.  His accomplishment in this film is gargantuan, with a powerful script and forceful direction of a talented cast.  The dialogue is fantastic, with snide humor and barbed innuendo that cuts like a stiletto.  The scene between Eve and pompous theater critic Addison Dewitt (George Sanders) where he confronts her about her past is like a mating of snakes.The acting is stupendous.

Since A Man For All Seasons is about upholding the standards of the Catholic faith, I must say that I find such comments very distressing, since they are out-and-out lies.  It's true that more Catholics have been getting divorced as of late, but that can be attributed to more outside influences which seek to eliminate God and moral accountability in our everyday lives.  These anti-religion movements tell people that divorce is OK; and their message has apparently succeeded because, simply put, modern society (DESPITE THE UNYIELDING STANCE OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH) does not consider marriage as sacred as it once did.  And the vast majority of those divorced Catholics do not adhere to the principles of the faith.  That said, the central issue in A Man For All Seasons is NOT the Catholic Church's unyielding opposition to divorce. The issue is really obedience.  The Catholic Church recognizes the Pope as Christ's representative on Earth (with all the authority that such a title implies), and thus regards defiance of the Pope as tantamount to defiance of Christ himself.  The Church has and will continue to grant divorces in extenuating circumstances to individuals who've shown that they were married to another who had somehow deceived them or who never treated the marriage as the sacred institution that God intends it to be.  However, Pope Clement did not see a king with a runaway libido wanting to marry his queen's more attractive servant as sufficient grounds to grant a divorce.  A special dispensation had been asked by and granted to King Henry VIII to marry Catharine of Aragon, the widow of Henry's brother.  The marriage had been blessed by the Church, and Catharine, while unable to provide a male heir to Henry, did provide him with a daughter (later Queen Mary I).  When the marriage didn't provide Henry with the male heir he wanted, he decided another marriage would be more convenient, and when the Pope didn't co-operate, Henry openly defied him by establishing himself as the head of a new Church of England.  Now the Church does not look too kindly upon schismatic behavior, and the Pope excommunicated Henry as a result.  Henry responded by trying to force all loyal Catholics in England to not only swear allegiance to him (which Sir Thomas More had already done), but to renounce their allegiance to the Pope and thus renounce their Catholic faith by signing an act condoning his divorce from Catherine and his subsequent marriage to Ann Boleyn (he only started beheading his wives after the Archbishop of his own Church refused to grant him any more divorces). This, of course, was something Sir Thomas (masterfully portrayed by Paul Scofield in an Oscar-winning performance) could not do, for he was the king's loyal subject...but God's first.  In fact, his integrity was such that he resigned the powerful and lucrative post of the King's Chancellor for his beliefs.  Thus, A Man For All Seasons is really the story of Sir Thomas More's struggle to remain a loyal subject of King Henry VIII (played by Robert Shaw) without compromising his Catholic ideals.  But Henry VIII was a king who demanded utter obedience in all things.  The ensuing stand-off between two of the strongest wills in the history of England thus becomes the central plot of the movie.  Other prominent figures in this struggle are King Henry's chancellor Thomas Cromwell (Leo McKern), who would stop at nothing to establish More's guilt; the traitorous Richard Rich (John Hurt), whose thirst for power meant more to him than his personal integrity; Alice More (Wendy Hiller), More's long-suffering wife, whom Sir Thomas seeks to make aware of his delicate situation; More's daughter, Margaret (played by Susannah York), Sir Thomas's pride and joy and also his greatest supporter; and Cardinal Wolsey (played in a cameo role by Orson Welles), More's predecessor as Chancellor, whose indecision concerning the king's desire for a divorce draws Sir Thomas in to the conflict.

Leuchter, Jr. is a  documentary about a professional executioner who is so certain about the scientific way he approaches his grim task that he doesn't realize when he is over his head. If you didn't know ahead of time anything about Leuchter you would think that Morris has chosen to film the story of a man who, because he was seen as being an expert in designing electric chairs, was soon hailed as an expert in all forms of execution.  His work in studying gas chambers leads to his downfall-the  conclusion that Auschwitz could not have been used to gas Jews to death.  The problem isn't so much Leuchter's ridiculous findings-it was that he was certain he was right, even in the face of overwhelming evidence otherwise.  As a result, Leuchter loses everything except the undying gratitude of neo-Nazis.Some reviewers criticize Morris for ridiculing Leuchter.  I don't think he does.   While I can't imagine Morris having any love for his subject, I think he is more concerned about answering the question, How could such a rational person go off the deep end?

The writer, director, and actors all come across as nice, well-intentioned people, and the story's premise has pretty good potential - the new head cheerleader (Dunst) finds out that all their award-winning routines were stolen via videotape from a better but financially-poor team from L.A., and on short notice they are forced to come up with a new routine for nationals in three weeks.The nice lady who wrote this had no prior movie experience and it shows. The dialog is mostly unrealistic. The script is intended to be mostly comedy, but most often I was simply embarassed for the film.  There were very few times I actually chuckled because of something funny. The script is full of genuinely juvenile stuff like giving the finger, farting, complex lines like whatever, very silly sexual references, those sorts of things.

What follows is a cat and mouse chase through the rubble of a destroyed city and the emotional struggle to survive. What was memorizing about this movie was the way the film makers drew the audience into the story.  From the outstanding performances to the pacing and the emotional musical score, never were you given a chance to become restless or bored.  Using some filming techniques seen before in Saving Private Ryan, the director really shows the brutality of the conflict between these enemies. The only failing that I would have to say about the movie would be the performers' accents.  All the characters were either Russian or German, yet all the accents were British or American.  Most noticeably was Rachel Weisz. She turns in a fantastic performance but her quite apparent British accent sometimes really distracts one away from the emotional attachment you might have towards the character.  Overall I would recommend this movie to anyone who is up for a true-life tale of amidst the horrors of war.  The graphic nature of the war scenes are not so over the top to scare away the squeamish, but it is shown so be prepared.

My folks took me to see Superman early in 1979. I had never been so transfixed in a film before. I was hooked as soon as those curtains opened. I took the film very seriously. As a matter of fact when Clark stares at the new style of phone booth and my mother laughed I elbowed her so hard the bruise lasted weeks. Ever since I have become very protective of the film. I associate it with the best times of my childhood. I am proud that my favourite super-hero is the last son of Krypton!I just can't imagine that my sheer joy of this '70's classic would have remained with me today if it weren't for the totally convincing performance of Christopher Reeve. He didn't camp up the role at all which must have been a great temptation in those tights. He made the man of steel someone who you could admire because of his caring nature. The epic nature of the film is something I don't think Hollywood would risk on a super-hero flick today which makes this film so special. If your kids haven't seen it yet, it's time they learn't about the true meaning of 'Truth Justice and the American Way!

I was instantly giggling at the trying to be oh-so-European attitude of the fantastic Shelley Winters, showing potential-boarder Humbert about the house, waving about her cigarette holder, trying to affect a sparkling laugh out of nowhere, and the fact that in spite of her efforts she ruins it all when she refers to the Colored Girl who they are lucky to have come in. Winters is perfectly batty, especially at a dance while feeding on a hot-dog and trying again to charm gentlemen, all the while mentioning unsightly details about her daughter (she's having a cavity filled this Wednesday!)The visuals are delightful as well - the period clothes, and the music score by Nelson Riddle the social-dance music, the fabulous 60's Teen Beat that punctuates many of Lolita's appearances, and of course the gay Cha-Cha Winters enacts for Humbert is a splendid blend of music and visual.The detail that delighted me the most, however, was all that business about the dang COT! They say the word over ten times (13, maybe?), even make hymes out of it (Are there any more cots, Potts?) and I even noticed a truck in an aerial establishing shot that said COTT on the back in script.  Was this intentional?  It so looked like file footage, but it is hilarious either way.  At any rate I loved it and laughed like a fool at the tedious scenes of the insistant black porter trying to unfurl it, oblivious to the silence Humbert tries to maintain so as not to wake the delicate Lolita who, upon awakening, says disinterestedly, Oh.  The cot came.  Fits of laughter. Fits.I guess the only thing I didn't care for was what I felt an overuse of Peter Sellars (although I adored his wordless female counterpart, who lends a most surreal aspect in her gloomy stares), though I did find the silent glance he makes at Surreal Lady over the funny pages in the Hotel Lobby absolutely breathtaking in its oddity.   The latter third of the film seemed to me a bit dry, and I found myself questioning the motives of the characters at that point, and wondering if it had to end the way it did, because of course a film about such subject matter could not end happily ever after in 1962...But rent it for Winters' scenes, the surreal names of the characters (Mr. Swine?), the cot sequences, and listen carefully to EVERY bit of suggestive or absurd dialogue in the first hour, there are many little surprises hiding there that make this film a joy to watch repeatedly.
