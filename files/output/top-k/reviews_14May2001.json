I got interested, I love romantic comedies and it's nice to watch something light, once and a while.The guy I knew from a tv show, but the woman didn't look strange, so I look closer and I saw it was someone I knew. I had to check it up at the magazine and I was very surprised, it was really her. I'm a big fan of Sophie Marceau, she is very beautiful and talented. I've seen her in movies like Braveheart, Anna Karenina and Firelight and she was always magnificent. They were all very difficult parts, very dense and emotional.But this movie is about a slim short guy who falls in love with his beautiful successful neighbour. He doesn't know what to do to get to know her . He tried to return her dog everytime it runs away, but everytime he only gets a thank you from her. So, he had this idea, hide the dog for a couple of hours and ask her to take a walk with him and try to find it. The plan goes well, he makes she think he's funny and charming, they have a good time. But, when he supposed to return the dog, he finds out that he can't. From this point on, it's just a lot of confusion and funny situations.David Space is great, the star of Just Shoot Me plays a part very similar with Finch, Sophie is not just beautiful and talented, but also very funny. And the script is okay. Although it's a little predictable, it's also charming and convincing. I mean, we believe that the hot neighbour can actually fall in love with the unactractive sweet guy.The movie doesn't want to be more than a good entertainment and it succeeds. Great chance to have good laughs and see a different Sophie Marceau.

This is a tough and sometimes difficult film to watch because of the unreleting violence that spills out from the screen and the general nastiness of not only Chopper but all of the characters in the film. This is not a film for everyone, which is a shame, because its one of the best films (if not the best) of 2000, and anyone interested in film and acting must see it. This is outlaw cinema for real, and I have to wonder what the hell Andrew Dominik the director & writer of the film will do as a follow up. To me on the basis of this first film of his, Dominik appears to be one of the more original filmmakers around, but I fear that like many of his fellow Australian movie makers he'll be gobbled up by Hollywood,which might be exactly what Mr. Dominik is hoping for. Based on the life and career of the bigger than life criminal and murderer Mark Chopper Read, the film begins in prison where Chopper is serving jail time for trying to kidnap a judge. The raw and shocking violence begins here, and continues as the film follows Chopper after he gets released from jail. At one point he tells his low life junkie whore girlfriend that he would like to have a normal life and watch the sunsets like everyone else, this is said right before he goes into one of his rages, and beats Tanya to a pulp, and knocks out her mom when she tries to get him to stop. This is just one example of the stuff Chopper pulls, and is one of the milder scenes in the film. You laugh as you cringe. Dominik uses short and taunt scenes to tell this strange fierce story,he doesn't want to bore. The editing is sharp and fast, the acting is fine and Eric Bana as Chopper gives a great and stunning performance, this is a star is born role, he's that good and new. You can't take your eyes off him, even though you want to turn your face away from all the havoc that he wrecks.

With all the lightweight garbage dumping itself out in this, the worst Spring movie season I've ever witnessed, a film by a reputable director seemed like a safe bet. Having never seen some of John Boorman's more recognized work such as `Deliverance', `Excalibur', `The General' or `Hope and Glory', I was going on reputation alone. But after seeing this fiasco, I am not eager to see any more of his films. Only a few minutes in, I knew I'd made a big mistake. But I sat through it because of one inevitability  eventually, it would have to end.MI-6 operative Andy Osnard (Brosnan) is on suspension for bad behavior in the field, and is given an assignment as watchdog over the Panama Canal, which has only recently been turned back over to the Panamanian government by the United States. Osnard will need someone who has connections to people in high places, someone corruptible. He finds the perfect pawn in Panama City's most noted tailor, Harry Pendel. Both are desperate men for different reasons. Harry owes his bank fifty grand (or something) and works in a business in which timely payment by clients is rare. He's already in over his head when Osnard comes along and, just like the devil making him an offer he can't refuse, takes advantage of Harry's desperation. Eager to repair his reputation as a field agent, Osnard needs any information that suggests that the Canal might fall into 'the Wrong Hands'. Harry makes suits for everyone, from former anti-Noriega freedom fighters to Panama's president. He basically tells Osnard what he wants to hear, which leads to degree upon degree of lies.

For Ted the Bellhop, things go from strange, to stranger, to even stranger in the comedy Four Rooms, a film that is really four films by four separate teams of filmmakers, all linked by location and a single character under increasingly urgent circumstances. When another character asks Ted his problem, his response is right on the money Problem? I haven't got a problem. I've got f*cking problems. Plural. One could also say that about this movie, a confusing, pointless mess of stale, unfunny humor, overacted characters, and a load of Hollywood stars and filmmakers so prestigious that it makes us wonder why such people would involve themselves such an unentertaining flop.Four Rooms stars Tim Roth in a biting, fanatical performance as Ted, a bellhop working at a faded hotel. He is the only person on duty this night, and he really gets his hands full. In the first story, called The Missing Ingredient, written and directed by Alison Anders, Ted checks in a clan of witches who try to perform a resurrection but can't because they lack a certain component in their spell. Naturally, its semen. What other bodily fluid is there in movies these days? Ted is the only male around, therefore, its only a matter of time before Ted finds himself seduced by a bare-breasted witch.The next segment, called The Wrong Man, written and directed by Alexander Rockwell, is equally as bad, if not worse (it's a tough call) as the first. Ted walks into a room with a manic depressive lunatic who holds his wife at gun point to test her fidelity. Ted becomes the middle man, with no where to run and nowhere to hide.Robert Rodriguez writes and directs the film's best part, though that's not saying a whole lot. It's called The Misbehavers and features Rodriguez's Desperado actor Antonia Banderas. He leads his rich, fancy family to the hotel, then abandons his two chaotic children to spend New Year's Eve with his lovely wife. He pays Ted five-hundred dollars to baby-sit them for a few hours. After a predictable hell breaks loose, Ted concludes this situation with the following reflection There's a putrid, rotting corpse of a dead whore stuck in the springs of the bed. There's rooms blazing afire. There's a big fat needle from God knows where, stuck in my leg, infecting me with God knows what. And finally there's me, walking out the door, right f*cking now. Buenas noches.The Man from Hollywood is the film's finale, by Pulp Fiction director Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino himself stars as an obnoxious Hollywood star who rents a suite with his bizarre arrangement of friends, including Bruce Willis as a man with marital difficulties. By the time Ted walks in, they're drunk and doing a replay of an old Alfred Hitchcock TV episode where a man bets he can light his lighter 10 times in a row. If he loses, he also loses his pinkie finger. This episode probably holds the record for containing the most four letter words in twenty minutes.Four Rooms has reportedly been substantially cut since its disastrous September 1995 screening at the Toronto Film Festival, but it's hard to imagine the film running any longer. The first half is a painful experience, while the second half is simply not good. The film has a lot of energy, a cute little theme song and opening credit sequence, and Tim Roth is hard at work here, quirky and full of life. But he is all by himself, not supported by the writing--there are problems within his character. The key to a movie like this is to keep the connecting character consistent through his experiences.However, Four Rooms changes him from meek and timid to explosively reactive. It's hard to laugh at jokes about abnormalities when the main character is almost deranged himself.The four film's connect well, and I kind of liked some of the material in the closing segments, including the performances by Bruce Willis and Quentin Tarantino. But even here the situation is disposable and the dialogue is all over the wall. Four Rooms keeps us stuck in a series of stories that are not funny, entertaining, or engaging, but lackluster and deprived.The film was released on Christmas Day, which really amazes me. This movie is R-rated and intended for adult audiences only, containing everything from plotless nudity to streaming vulgarisms.

Had the opening anything to do with the rest of the film at all, either in style, intensity, or substance, this would have been a great film.  Instead, it's a disaster.  At 3 hours, it's just about 2.5 hours too long.  The beginning is actually interesting and you are dying to see how they will tie this large variety of characters together in the end.  Guess what  they don't!  There are two completely disjoint sets of characters with no connection other than a produced by sign.  That's bad enough, but then we have lots of characters that seem to have no point.  The boy contestant on the game show?  The wife who overdoses?  What point was there in killing the dog?  What ties they did create were very weak.  What is even worse if how the show deteriorates into monologues near the end.  They go on FOREVER.  I found myself praying for a scene change so we could get on with the movie.

It revolves around the men of Charlie Company who are assaulting the island of Guadalcanal in the South Pacific.  Although it could be argued that the title The Thin Red Line refers to the front line of war, I find it easier to believe that it refers to the line between sanity and insanity, as Jim Caviezel (Pvt. Witt) has pointed out in an interview.A quick overview of my opinions on this movie I consider it to be in the Top 10 movies of all time, for my money at least.  It is a deeply philosophical movie, depicting both the horrors of war and the beauty of life.  It has the ability to mesmerize you with the splendor of nature, and in the same instant disgust you with the terrors of man.  This movie gives you a deeply personal look inside the minds of the soldiers and we feel as one with them as we walk the thin red line.  I hope to attempt to analyze all aspects of the movie that I can in a relatively short piece.Lets start by meeting some of the main characters of Charlie Company.  We have Pvt. Witt, Sgt. Welsh, Cpt. Staros, Pvt. Bell, Pvt. Doll, and Col. Tall.  These are just some of the men we meet in the movie, but I am focusing on them because we get a deep look inside their experience with Guadalcanal.Each man seems to have his own way to escape the war Pvt. Witt literally escapes to a Melanesian Island when he goes AWOL, and finds the love of family and the serenity of true peace there.  Pvt. Bell escapes with the memory of his wife, with her love.  Cpt. Staros escapes the horrors of the war through his love for his men, which he considers to be his sons.  Pvt. Doll, who seems to almost be our narrator, escapes into his own mind, as he poetically looks at the good and evil of the war and tries to resolve it deep inside himself.  Col. Tall escapes by focusing on his career and all that his family and his men have sacrificed at his orders.The audio and the visual aspects of this movie are absolutely stunning.  The colors are vibrant and sharp, the music soft and melodic.  During the battles the skies are bright blues, the grass is green, the sun seems to melt across the landscape like a warm wave.  However, the soldiers, their gear, and everything unnatural and part of the war is in muted browns and blacks, no color their.  Almost as if these monochromatic men were nothing more than chess pieces, and they obviously do not belong on this beautiful board.  We also noticed that the Japanese soldiers, too, have no color to them.  They appear almost no differently than the American soldiers.The musical soundtrack to this movie reflects this as well.  It is almost as if the music is the exact opposite of the scene during a tense, horrific battle we hear the soft, beautiful melodies of strings serenading us in the background.  The beautiful music carries a lilting, mournful tone, as if to both decry and mourn the horror that is going on around it.  The stark contrast between the beauty of the music and scenery and the ugliness of the war leave us feeling even more disjointed and askew with reality.As we proceed through the film, we are put in the position of an anonymous soldier who is along with the rest of the men.  The camera tracks low on the grass as we crawl, jumps erratically as we run, and pauses to look at the sunlight filtering through the canopy in a rare, unguarded moment of beauty. We feel one with the men and are treated to a rare look at their deepest, darkest and innermost thoughts.As they wrestle with the philosophical and moral issues of what they are doing, we hear it all.  We are there when they realize with horror that they are no different than the men they kill.  We are there when they come to the understanding that with a roll of the dice it could have been them dead on the ground or beginning for mercy.  We learn through their eyes that there are no winners in the war, that everyone is a victim.As each of the men try to escape these horrors in their own way, we see that all of the escapes revolve around love for Staros, it is the love of his men.  For Witt it is the love of that other world he once saw.  For Bell, the love of his wife.  For Welsh, though, it is the love of the hope that Witt carries within him.  Welsh himself has been too jaded with the war to feel the same things that Witt feels, so instead he escapes vicariously through Witt, a man he almost treats as a brother.In the end, however, we learn that the war takes all of their escapes Witt's Melanesian family turn on him in fear, Bell's wife leaves him for an Airman.  Staros is relieved of his command; Tall sacrifices the love and trust of his men for his career.  Doll never seems able to resolve his moral argument going on deep inside him.  And Welsh loses his escape when Witt lost his.In the end, Welsh realizes that to survive the war each man must find something that is his own and hold on to it.  This may be the closest thing to an epiphany that this movie has.  We learn through him that the thin red line between sanity and insanity is razor-sharp, and it may be impossible to walk it in war without falling off.As the survivors of Charlie Company leave Guadalcanal they are treated once more to a view of its beauty.  It's as if everything they saw had been nothing more than a terrible dream to be forgotten and swallowed up in the beauty of nature around them.  But each man also leaves with something buried inside them that only they and we privileged few will ever understand.The Thin Red Line is a beautiful and deeply philosophical movie that pulls you in and leaves you feeling lost at the end.  If you are lucky, you come out with a small understanding of the true cost of war.  I highly recommend that you watch it many times.

If it weren't true, it would be a great concept for a film!  This concept is made more brilliant by the natural 'tension' of the plot.  Novelyne Price is almost the complete opposite -- even her shared love of writing has nothing in common with Robert Howard's 'shocking' taste.

Like a Ralph Bakshi nightmare without the hardcore animal sex, Selick's film is strange, surreal, slightly disturbing, and, at certain intervals, fine and clever fun.Stu Miley (Brendan Fraser) is an example of the healing power of art, having battled back from depression and almost paralyzing nightmares by channelling his horrors into an anarchic cartoon alter ego named Monkeybone, who wreaks havoc through the pages of an underground comic book.  Stu's comic is now being turned into a cartoon series for TV, complete with a raft of merchandising, but he's still not happy, and it gets worse when he is in a violent car accident and gets transported to Downtown, a bizarre limbo world between earth and what lies beyond.  Here, Monkeybone is real, a devilish prankster nightclub emcee, and when he finds out that there's a way back to the real world, he does some con work to get out into Stu's body and wreak some earthly havoc.  It's now up to Stu's soul, trapped Downtown, to get out and reclaim his body before Monkeybone turns the world into an army of out-of-control id-monsters like himself.As you can probably already tell, this film is not your standard cookie-cutter Hollywood product.  The plot alone is bizarre enough to warrant a look, but for fans of monster makeup, special effects, and art direction, Monkeybone will qualify as a must-see.  Selick cut his directorial chops on The Nightmare Before Christmas, and here, the world he creates is like a live-action mutation of that same bizarre stop-motion boneyard.  Freakish creatures crowd the boardwalks of Downtown, scythe-wielding reapers swoop the skies on gray-shrouded motorcycles, and the way back to earth is a circus strength-testing machine that shoots souls up through the gaping mouth of a floating Abraham Lincoln coin bank.  Animation rubs shoulders with live action (the Monkeybone character himself is a computer graphic, voiced by John Turturro), and virtually every shot contains something bizarre and new to marvel over.  If nothing else, Monkeybone is further proof that special effects technicians today can do just about anything.Unfortunately, the story is such that we find ourselves hard-pressed to care about what's going on.  Stu is a lumpy sad sack before his accident; he's much more fun when Monkeybone takes over, leering in a bad goatee and shaking his booty at his confused girlfriend (Bridget Fonda).  The plot to run riot over the world is dashed off more or less as an afterthought, and there's just not enough juice here in terms of the characters to really pull us into their dilemma.  What's worse, as amazing as Downtown and its denizens are to see, nothing really happens there.  It's almost like a big celluloid tattoo; fun to look at, but with nothing really behind it at all.The actors do what they can to redeem the material.  Fraser ceaselessly amazes me with his guileless bravery.  This is a man utterly unafraid to look silly, stupid, or flat-out weird, and Monkeybone tests these abilities to the breaking point.  His performance here is not as inspired as his work in last year's Bedazzled, which gave him seven characters to play, but he has fun, especially with the frantic final act, when Monkeybone has taken over Stu's body.  Dave Foley gives some prissy snap to his role as Stu's agent, and Rose McGowan proves that, even in whiskers as a cat-faced Downtown barmaid, she's still one of the sexiest women in movies.  The surprise here, however, is Chris Kattan, who plays a recently deceased gymnast reanimated when Stu's soul needs a host body to battle with Monkeybone.  Picture a corpse jolted back to life with entirely too intense electricity, and that's the effect of Kattan's riotous physical comedy here.  Not to mention the fact that he's being chased by doctors, eager for the donor organs that keep plopping out of the autopsy slit in his stomach.Overall, I would say Monkeybone is an interesting failure.  It offers a lot of great visual moments, and is worth seeing once for Fraser and Kattan, but it's one of those experiences that leaves you feeling undernourished at the end.  There's nothing to hold onto, nothing to take away from the experience.  Still, even though the result is no masterpiece, I have to admire the efforts of Selick and Co.  Their biggest mistake?  They should have thought smaller.  It's not a great film, but Monkeybone, I think, would have made one hell of an album cover.

They cram lots of special effects, fighting, running and everything else that makes a movie vibrate into about 90 minutes.Unfortunately, that rarely makes these summer flicks *good* movies. Even allowing for the mindlessness of a summer film, I had a hard time with aspects of Mummy 2. I gave it a 6, and only because of the fact it was intended to be a summer film.First, I don't know what Brendan Fraser is doing, but his portrayal of an action hero in the Indiana Jones tradition is awkward. Fraser bounces back and forth between sentimental husband and savy adventurer, able to snatch snakes and knives out of the air. He even *walks* funny, kind of hunched over, gorilla-like. The sequel (and the original) make great efforts to tell us, through dialogue, that Fraser's character is blunt and more likely to fight and ask questions later than think his way out of a tough situation. And yet this same character is so sensitive to his wife, and so aware of the needs of those around him, that his action guy mode seems out of place. He is too smart and too caring to be the fearless hero.Second, why in the world did this movie create a very cheesy scorpion king monster in the finale? That was probably the most fake looking monster, especially the face (which was The Rock's face, sort of), I have seen since that 1982ish movie about Perseus and the Greek gods who manipulated him. You kept expecting this scorpion thing to speak, and we had several close-ups of the enraged face, but all it ever did was roar. And this was supposed to be the latest version of a great warrior bent on taking over the world? He seemed as smart as a rock (no pun intended).Finally, several actors\/roles were all wrong, or at least not done well. Izzy, the dirigible-for-hire guy, was supposed to provide comic relief, I guess. But his delivery and English accent were far too sophisticated to be convincing for the kind of rogue-for-hitre character he played. The character who was curator at the British museum and as well as the person who was bringing Ahotep back from the dead made no sense. What was his motivation? We never saw Ahotep reward anyone except his woman. Why help him?Still, the movie was loud, fast and mostly fun, even if it made little sense.

That will undoubtably change with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, but for now, let us focus on Dungeons & Dragons.As a lifelong fan of the game, I had long known a movie was in the works, but even five years ago when I read the plot outline (the script was being worked on for ten years), I was disappointed.  Main heroes--thieves? Politics?  More and more it sounded like the less-than-imaginative, coorporate mentality of D&D in the 90s rather than the classic mythos of the 70s and 80s that made it great (al la, when Gygax was still with TSR).Well, I would give the movie the benefit of the doubt, and we geeks and lunatics went on opening night in full costume to mark this long awaited event.  Credit where it's due, the movie's relatively small ($33 million) budget did turn out good production values, including a wide variety of beautiful, very D&D-like sets, costumes, and special effects.  However, the movie was crippled beyond hope by the script and acting.  Yes, the plot was imaginative, but you think with TEN YEARS of development one would have realized and fixed all the plot holes, the biggest of which was the fact that, in the end, the heroes accomplished absolutely nothing!  All they did was spend the entire movie tracking down a rod that controls dragons, only to end up giving it to the villain, making him stronger than ever, and then the princess he oh-so feared whips him anyway, probably (and off camera of course) to Thorna BITCH at the heroes afterwards--Thanks for making my job tougher, guys!The acting was atrocious.  I know this game was targeted at teens who play the game, but it felt TOO MUCH like a game.  You would think that moviemakers would have learned from such fiascos as Super Mario Bros and Double Dragon that, in order to turn a game into a film, it needs to take itself seriously.  Jay Jar Wayans could have been left out, the Princess (Thorna Birch) could have tried to be something other than a piece of cardboard, and the other characters could have actually been there to do something.  Back to the fault in the script, isn't the main concept of D&D an adventure PARTY?  But in this movie, it's always a lone hero going forward while the rest of the party hangs in the back.  Well, that along with the empty ending, I guess, accidentily, they DID make a movie that plays like a D&D game of today.  Hmmmm...If you approach this movie as a campy, popcorn movie, then it's a surprisingly good treat, eye-candy mostly.  However, if you have any love or passion for D&D, any desire to be thrust into a fantasy world, or any hope of a gripping adventure, then try to avoid this movie as much as a modern D&D adventurer avoids danger.Given the rich mythology of D&D developed over the last twenty five years, the countless worlds and countless possibilities for storylines, it seems that a script ten years in the making ended up with the most politically correct (gahhhh), Star Wars-like, cheesy, save-the-world scenario possible, which, of course, is totally against the spirit of the D&D game.  Now, for a few nit-pickin's1) No fighter.  Given D&D's Conan roots, you'd think there would be at least one fighter in the party, but there wasn't.2) The dwarf.  He was almost as tall as everybody else.  Although he played a dwarf rather well (given the stereotypes), he just wasn't dwarven.3) Stolen scenes.  Mostly from Star Wars.Oh well.  Actually, an official D&D movie was never a good idea, because the whole of D&D mythology could not be compressed into one movie, or even an entire series of movies.  We're better off enjoying cinematic treats like Conan, Willow, and Lord of the Rings, and re-living their mythologies in the D&D world.  That said, look for the Lord of the Rings to completely change moviegoer's views on fantasy, and finally establish the genre.

Along with Body of Evidence and Evita, this movie shows what an incredible actress she really is and isn't even given any credit for it.  For the people who are reading this for the plot of the movie, here it goes.  Madonna plays Abbie, a forty-something woman who is single and desperate for a family of her own.  One night, she and her gay best friend Robert have a little too much to drink, which leads to a roll in the sack.  When Abbie discovers she is pregnant, she decides to keep the baby and have her family with the father (Rupert Everett).  Along comes Ben (Benjamin Bratt), who is understandably taken with Abbie.  The two form a relationship with causes conflicts in the family, especially with Abbie's son.  What's so great about this movie is that it starts out as a light-hearted comedy and slowly turns into a drama.  I would highly recommend this movie.  It is definitely the best movie of 2000.

Though it's no surprise he wasn't nominated, it was Oscar-caliber material. Even as he challenges the Kennedy myth by playing him as a man who can anger and entertain doubt in private, he burnishes it by letting his Kennedy submerge all doubt behind perfect resolve whenever it's demanded the mythic Kennedy nerve.Overall, the film plays a little fast and loose with persons and actions (though history seems largely unscathed, by contrast with Stone's JFK), so it's best to see this as parable, and see Costner's character as a sort of greek chorus to Kennedy and his cabinet. It's a wonderfully made film, though -- what may become a classic study in how to craft a thriller without physical thrills.
