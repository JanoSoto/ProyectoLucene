Lawrence Fishbourne the name says it all. And Carrie-Anne Moss, a stunning as well as beautiful actor.The fight scenes get a paragraph of their own. The best I've ever seen! The martial arts scenes make you salivate as you watch Neo (Keanu Reeves), Morpheus (Lawrence Fishbourne), and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) whip up on the bad guys.The plot, as I've seen, has no holes. I've seen THE MATRIX dozens of times. When I'm sitting around the house with nothing to do, I'll pop in THE MATRIX, cuz I never get sick of it. Just yesterday, I was watching it, and found something that I had earlier missed. Everything in the movie ties into each other.

That can't be done by special effects.  They take you away from reality.  The best scary movies are believable because you can feel yourself in the situation.  So it doesn't actually matter whether or not you know the story is real - it works because you can very easily imagine it could be.I liked the camerawork, the grainy film, the clever tricks like switching from b\/w to colour & back, pointing the camera at the ground while you hear weird noises.  But while the actors were good in their parts, what makes you not care about the film as you otherwise would is the unlikeability of the main characters.  It's a fine idea of the breakdown of relationships under pressure, and it's fair enough to show the actors shouting and arguing at each other as well as their situation.  But we got too much of this, actually they were pretty much fighting with each other the entire time. This made them unlikeable ultimately - we should have seen some warmer aspects of their characters.And hey, I don't mind a bit of bad language when characters are under real pressure, but it should be used sparingly or else they're just unpleasant, brutish, and you can't care about them as you want to.  These guys (all three including the girl) were shown to be swearing the whole movie, even before any scary or pressure situations - they could hardly utter a single sentence without it!  Realistic?  You don't get this level of bad language even in settings where you would more likely expect it (eg the Godfather, Reservoir Dogs).

According to Soviet sports training books I have read the kinds of training depicted in the movie may very well be accurate. There are only two things that may be a stretch. The first is the use of sparring partners by Drago. The movie depicts Drago pummelling every one of his partners sending them to the canvas spitting up blood. This of course doesn't happen in real life-sparring partners are partners not punching bags. The second thing about Drago's training that is questionable is his use of steroids in the movie. Contrary to popular belief this was not a wide spread practice and in fact it was condemed by the government. Any athlete who was caught doing steriods or any coach who distributed them were eliminated from the sports program. Soviet scientists and trainers knew that the use of steroids only provided a quick boost in strength, and that continued use of them would cause extensive injuries to the athlete. In short the athlete would be injured so much that he would have been able to train harder and acheive maximum performance without the drugs. In the movie's defence though, the scene is relevant in the context that we all thought the Soviets were taking superior drugs thus adding to our fear of them.This movie definitely displayed our thoughts and emotions dealing with the Cold War right up to the very end.

He'd written countless different musical interpretations of Maria's final speech, in a variety of styles and musical forms, and none of them had come close to working.  The scene was a dramatic climax, and in an opera any such scene would have to be a musical climax as well.

The figure is clad in a bulky snowsuit and gloves, reaching out towards the viewer. Friends, that poster scared the holy beejezus out of me.

The majority of this hunting expedition manage to blow themselves up (two lessons learned one, short-timed explosives and deep, powdery snow don't mix; two I don't know what word that Norwegian used just before the big boom, but I'm pretty sure it was a good bit stronger than drat) and the one remaining gets shot through the eye by the camp commander Garry.  Garry, we will find, is always ready to go for the head shot.After a brief caucus, helicopter pilot MacReady and Doc Copper tool on out to the Norwegian base to scout for survivors of the presumed outbreak of cabin fever.  What they find instead is a camp full of holes, ice and snow, with everyone dead by suicide or smoldering on a burn heap out back. While sifting through the scattered scientific knickknacks, they also happen across a large block of ice with a likewise large hole in it (watch for the precariously swinging icicle - I didn't know they did that).The Norwegian's video logs lead the Americans to an excavation site near their own camp. The unfortunate Europeans apparently had uncovered a huge space ship buried for some hundred thousand years (I'm going to be charitable and only refer to it here as a flying saucer, despite its perfect dinner plate shape) with the...er, top hatch open.  A few dozen yards away is a rectangular hole in the ground more or less corresponding with the size of the block of ice at the shattered camp.Back at home base, the dog that narrowly escaped becoming a bullet caddie at the hands of the Norwegians is put into the kennel with the other huskies. Once the nosy humans have departed, though, the newcomer begins to noisily and juicily (there really isn't any other way to put it) shed its skin and manhandle its more terrestrial counterparts.  Hearing the howls coming from the kennel, MacReady sounds the alarm (smashing the glass facing with a can of Budweiser, how cool is that?).  He and Garry pump a few dozen rounds into the mutating visitor before Childs flash-fries it with a flame thrower.On a side note here, I wonder how many Antarctic research stations come with flamethowers.  It's not exactly like you can de-ice your windshield with them.  I think Alan Dean Forester's book touches on this point, but it's been so long since I've read it, I can't be sure.With a heavy assist from MaCReady (pretty good, considering his penchant for the sauce), our boys put two and two together.

The Thing masquerading as the dog had been wandering around the camp for hours and could have infected any one of the team, perhaps more than one.  The men eye each other with increasing suspicion as the disappearances begin.  The race begins to find a way of determining who is still human and who is The Thing.Security in my hometown theater was uncommonly vigorous back in 1982, so I never got the chance to see The Thing on the big screen.  Instead, I was inducted via videotape in a basement den at three in the morning with four of my friends glued to the screen.  Our nerves has already been raked over the hot coals by a back-to-back viewing of Evil Dead 2 and A Nightmare on Elm Street, somewhere between four and fourteen Cokes on top of no food (we'd spent all our food money on videos like responsible young people). By the time The Thing was over and our host was loading up another Carpenter opus, Prince of Darkness, we were looking at each other much in the same way that Jack Torrance looked at Grady in the washroom of the Overlook in The Shining.The Thing is a masterwork of suspicion and paranoia.  The problem is wilier than suspecting someone of being a pod person.  Pod people, we have learned, don't show emotion, while The Thing can imitate emphatic speech, anger, hostility and all the other passionate emotions so as to be undetectable from a human being.  The only person you don't suspect is MacReady, and that's only because most of us wouldn't think Kurt Russell would let an alien get the drop on him.  But you never know...The almost choking atmosphere is enriched by the idea of the location (an almost completely cut-off compound in the literal middle of nowhere) and the location itself.  Carpenter includes many pointedly lingering shots of empty, poorly-lit hallways, giving an impression of both the vulnerability of the camp's inhabitants and the million or so hiding places available to the camp's invader.As usual, Carpenter wrote the music for the film.  This is a hit-or-miss practice for him, and here it is dead on the mark.  The thudding, simplistic soundtrack is a perfect match for the increasing sense of dread as the story unfolds.The acting is so solid as to be almost flawless.  No one character is focused on as far as his background, motives, etc. are concerned.  The only importance they have is what they contribute to the unfolding events. Carpenter realizes the necessity of this collectively light handling of such a relatively large starring cast (no one can be considered supporting here) and he manipulates each man's screen time like a professional puppeteer.The Thing itself is a masterpiece of special effects.  I have to pluralize that because it assumes several different shapes, and it's impossible to say which one is its natural form.  These shapes vary from something resembling The Aliens Deadly Spawn to The Incredible Melting Man to a kind of demonically mutated Alaskan snow crab (think about that last one when Blair cracks the leg off).  There's none of that hokey matting or baldly obvious CGI to be found here; rather, The Thing is all traditional foam latex, animatronics and gallons and gallons of trusty old stage blood.It's rare to find a film, especially a horror film, that can stand the test of time to resist appearing dated after a number of years.  Eighteen years later, the special effects in The Thing still blow me away.  I seem to recall that when it premiered, said effects were so gruesome and over-the-top that Time magazine ran a pictorial with some of the choicer scenes.  If Time acknowledges a horror flick within its hallowed pages,you know Carpenter must have struck a chord.Have no illusions, The Thing is a bloody film.  It's not as graphic as some I've seen, but it can still carry its weight in the gore department. Definitely not the film to watch while eating room temperature raspberry pudding.  Yet it is one of those movies that buffs refer to as a must see. It has so much going for it on so many levels that I can overlook the minor stumbling blocks such as Blair's seven-shot revolver, MacReady's incredible disappearing snow hat and a few other inconsequential trivialities.  A close scrutiny of this phenomenal blend of science fiction and outright visceral horror is an absolute necessity for anyone interested in either genre.In way of an afterword, the following are some faces you might remember having seen elsewhere MacReady This, in my opinion, has been Kurt Russell's finest role ever, and stomps hell out of both his turns as Snake Plissken in Carpenter's Escape From... movies.

While sifting through the scattered scientific knickknacks, they also happen across a large block of ice with a likewise large hole in it (watch for the precariously swinging icicle - I didn't know they did that).The Norwegian's video logs lead the Americans to an excavation site near their own camp. The unfortunate Europeans apparently had uncovered a huge space ship buried for some hundred thousand years (I'm going to be charitable and only refer to it here as a flying saucer, despite its perfect dinner plate shape) with the...er, top hatch open.  A few dozen yards away is a rectangular hole in the ground more or less corresponding with the size of the block of ice at the shattered camp.Back at home base, the dog that narrowly escaped becoming a bullet caddie at the hands of the Norwegians is put into the kennel with the other huskies. Once the nosy humans have departed, though, the newcomer begins to noisily and juicily (there really isn't any other way to put it) shed its skin and manhandle its more terrestrial counterparts.  Hearing the howls coming from the kennel, MacReady sounds the alarm (smashing the glass facing with a can of Budweiser, how cool is that?).  He and Garry pump a few dozen rounds into the mutating visitor before Childs flash-fries it with a flame thrower.On a side note here, I wonder how many Antarctic research stations come with flamethowers.  It's not exactly like you can de-ice your windshield with them.  I think Alan Dean Forester's book touches on this point, but it's been so long since I've read it, I can't be sure.With a heavy assist from MaCReady (pretty good, considering his penchant for the sauce), our boys put two and two together.  The Norwegians had found an alien frozen in the ice, carted it back to their camp and thawed it out. The Thing (as it is unofficially dubbed) thaws out and wreaks the expected amount of havoc before beating a hasty retreat across the frozen wasteland. Enter our heroes.The Thing, Blair hypothesizes, is able to absorb other life forms and reshape its own body to assume the appearance of anything it has ingested. The imitation is perfect and undetectable, at least on the basis of sight alone.  As usual, animals are hip to the deception (the other dogs went wild when the newcomer was put into their kennel), but humans aren't so lucky.Here the paranoia begins to take root.  The Thing masquerading as the dog had been wandering around the camp for hours and could have infected any one of the team, perhaps more than one.  The men eye each other with increasing suspicion as the disappearances begin.  The race begins to find a way of determining who is still human and who is The Thing.Security in my hometown theater was uncommonly vigorous back in 1982, so I never got the chance to see The Thing on the big screen.  Instead, I was inducted via videotape in a basement den at three in the morning with four of my friends glued to the screen.  Our nerves has already been raked over the hot coals by a back-to-back viewing of Evil Dead 2 and A Nightmare on Elm Street, somewhere between four and fourteen Cokes on top of no food (we'd spent all our food money on videos like responsible young people). By the time The Thing was over and our host was loading up another Carpenter opus, Prince of Darkness, we were looking at each other much in the same way that Jack Torrance looked at Grady in the washroom of the Overlook in The Shining.The Thing is a masterwork of suspicion and paranoia.  The problem is wilier than suspecting someone of being a pod person.  Pod people, we have learned, don't show emotion, while The Thing can imitate emphatic speech, anger, hostility and all the other passionate emotions so as to be undetectable from a human being.  The only person you don't suspect is MacReady, and that's only because most of us wouldn't think Kurt Russell would let an alien get the drop on him.  But you never know...The almost choking atmosphere is enriched by the idea of the location (an almost completely cut-off compound in the literal middle of nowhere) and the location itself.  Carpenter includes many pointedly lingering shots of empty, poorly-lit hallways, giving an impression of both the vulnerability of the camp's inhabitants and the million or so hiding places available to the camp's invader.As usual, Carpenter wrote the music for the film.  This is a hit-or-miss practice for him, and here it is dead on the mark.  The thudding, simplistic soundtrack is a perfect match for the increasing sense of dread as the story unfolds.The acting is so solid as to be almost flawless.  No one character is focused on as far as his background, motives, etc. are concerned.  The only importance they have is what they contribute to the unfolding events. Carpenter realizes the necessity of this collectively light handling of such a relatively large starring cast (no one can be considered supporting here) and he manipulates each man's screen time like a professional puppeteer.The Thing itself is a masterpiece of special effects.  I have to pluralize that because it assumes several different shapes, and it's impossible to say which one is its natural form.  These shapes vary from something resembling The Aliens Deadly Spawn to The Incredible Melting Man to a kind of demonically mutated Alaskan snow crab (think about that last one when Blair cracks the leg off).  There's none of that hokey matting or baldly obvious CGI to be found here; rather, The Thing is all traditional foam latex, animatronics and gallons and gallons of trusty old stage blood.It's rare to find a film, especially a horror film, that can stand the test of time to resist appearing dated after a number of years.  Eighteen years later, the special effects in The Thing still blow me away.  I seem to recall that when it premiered, said effects were so gruesome and over-the-top that Time magazine ran a pictorial with some of the choicer scenes.  If Time acknowledges a horror flick within its hallowed pages,you know Carpenter must have struck a chord.Have no illusions, The Thing is a bloody film.  It's not as graphic as some I've seen, but it can still carry its weight in the gore department. Definitely not the film to watch while eating room temperature raspberry pudding.  Yet it is one of those movies that buffs refer to as a must see. It has so much going for it on so many levels that I can overlook the minor stumbling blocks such as Blair's seven-shot revolver, MacReady's incredible disappearing snow hat and a few other inconsequential trivialities.  A close scrutiny of this phenomenal blend of science fiction and outright visceral horror is an absolute necessity for anyone interested in either genre.In way of an afterword, the following are some faces you might remember having seen elsewhere MacReady This, in my opinion, has been Kurt Russell's finest role ever, and stomps hell out of both his turns as Snake Plissken in Carpenter's Escape From... movies. Norris Charles Hallahan here sports a slightly bushier head of hair than in Dante's Peak. Copper  Richard Dysart is no stranger to horror films, having starred in the John Frankenheimer flick Prophecy (not The Prophecy, just Prophecy!) as the eeeeeeeeevil paper mill foreman. It must be noted that in 1984 he also contributed his voice to the TV cartoon Challenge of the GoBots. Blair Wilford Brimley (sans mustache), the guy from the Quaker Oatmeal commercial!  Don't think the hot cereal jokes weren't being hooted fast and furious.  Oh, yeah, and he was also in The Firm. Childs Keith David has also given his voice to Spawn on the HBO animated series of the same name, although my favorite role of his was as Louis, the psycho garbage collection supervisor in Men at Work. Clark Donald Moffat is another one of those actors along the lines of Lance Henrikson who has been in nearly everything, including It, The Believers and Nightmares.

In 1989 you had the 'classic' fans, the KHAN generation,  civilians won over by THE VOYAGE HOME, and NEXT GENERATION fans.   Expectations crossed the board.   Making matters worse, the writers had a clean slate,  resulting in a muddled original story.  The answer should have been  incorporating some TREK history and acknowledging the NEXT GENERATION. Instead, we got tangents.  Like Spock's brother.3. SPECIAL EFFECTS How could one of the strongest movie franchises in town let this happen? Fans should petition to get Nick Myer to do a STAR WARS style Special Edition.4.  THE FALL From Kirk's foot slip to I expect that's Klingon for 'hello'  this movie holds some of the most embarrassing moments in Star Trek.  I remember the butterflies in my stomach as Spock dives into this dumb scene with FX from Saturday morning.  The Nimbus bar (office for the delegates?) is a lame copy of the STAR WARS cantina.5.  DEFECTIVE ENTERPRISE This crew works at a disadvantage in every film but UNDISCOVERED......even GENERATIONS.  The broken ship is a tired device, and here it doesn't make sense. There's no relevance to the plot, except maybe the broken transporter. Other functions are played only for 'laughs'.6.  SUPPORTING CAST WASTED Sulu and Chekov lost! --hilarious! Uhura stripping!! --A riot!!  Scotty bangs his head! ...okay, that was actually pretty funny.  The director was not responsible for most trouble,  but he has no idea how to treat these characters.  Not realizing their value, he plays them either goofy or hypnotized.  A missed opportunity for drama in exposing their pain or portraying the forced betrayal of Kirk.  Remember Chekov's struggle in 'KHAN'.7.  KLINGONS Used only as a conflict device, they have no motivation given except to 'get Kirk'.  There could have been an effort to rescue Korrd or even direct orders from the Klingons to use the conflict as an excuse to entrap Kirk. (like UNDISCOVERED...)  I did like the use of Klingonese but if you follow closely, there's a Klingon word for Kalicams... which IS a Klingon word...8.  THE HANGER DECK The design department has no concept of perspective.  The look was great but the proportions are way off.  This contributes to a feeling that something is not right.  A well acted scene has the effect of a school play.  I was drawing technical plans for this stuff when I was 10!!  How could they be so far off.9.  I WANT JIM KIRK! The Admiral's reason for sending the undermanned Enterprise.  Why??  With Klingons involved, it means trouble.  Are we to believe the average Starship captain is THAT unprepared for this situation.  It would have made more sense if  Enterprise were the ONLY option.10.  SYBOK'S TAKEOVER Controlling the bridge, Sybok takes over.  Where is everybody? And why do crewmembers stand passively, listening to his message.  He relieved everyone's pain?  From here on, the story moves around the characters.  Scotty tries to animate things... until he's knocked out.11.  SPOCK'S BROTHER I'll accept that he has a half-brother we don't know about.  Sybok isn't the type of guy Spock would discuss.  But it's such an obvious device from which to squeeze drama.  Ooooh, conflict...HOW will Spock resolve this one.  The film suffers from too many plot contrivances for us to accept this on too.  No matter how good these two actors are.  (And they are good. When they first meet?  Golden!!)12. THE TURBOSHAFT CLIMB Dumb idea, bad FX, lame jokes.  ...and the floor numbers are wrong.13.  TOO MANY RED HERRINGS The significance of Nimbus, the ship's malfunctions, Spock's brother, hostages, etc.  These things don't affect the storyline in the end.  Take the SOS message from the Officers Lounge. This is intercepted by the Klingons (who already know where they are..) and serves only as a vehicle for Sybok to confront them.14.  THE GREAT BARRIER Another arbitrary plot device.  They zip through with no explanation as to how. Even if Sybok knew how, the Klingons follow with no problem.15.  DON'T JUST STAND THERE... GOD IS A BUSY MAN Don't just stand there????  Captain! The director has given us nothing to do!!16.  GOD-THING The film's lame effects especially disappoint here.  The GOD face is laughable.  Audiences can't believe they're viewing GOD, and guess what? It's not.  Confusion is inevitable.  If he's fake, make him a real fake!! (Remember Balok?) The concept of an alien being trapped on this planet and Sybok's willingness to believe should have been flushed out more.  McCoy asking, Is this the voice of God? was wrong.   That should have been Sybok.  The real story of the GOD-THING is left unclear.  It needed a Perry Mason type ending. There's just one thing I don't understand, Jim...17. GHOST ATTACK There's no ghosts in Star Trek.  Having 'something' shake the shuttle, chase Kirk, and make a lot of racket is a poor compromise of the Directors original idea's.18.  CONVENIENT KLINGON TORPEDO...which kills the transporter.   Now what??  Oh brother!  I was wise to that bit before I was in high school.19. THE CLIMAX The story falls apart from here. Klingons aren't needed here; they clutter up the action,  Kirk runs from... what? GOD lightning!  It sure has bad aim. The enemy saves the day.  The Klingon apology, and finally... Spock in the gunner chair.  All of this feels like the results of a 'we need an ending' meeting.  Although I like the exchange between Kirk and Spock, this could have taken place on the Enterprise.20.  THE SOLEMN ENDING Sybok is dead.  GOD doesn't live here.  The entire STORY has been a red herring.  Still... we have each other...  Star Trek movies aren't known for happy endings,  but this one's especially dark.  Cool Vulcan harp, though.

Instead, we got tangents.  Like Spock's brother.3. SPECIAL EFFECTS How could one of the strongest movie franchises in town let this happen? Fans should petition to get Nick Myer to do a STAR WARS style Special Edition.4.  THE FALL From Kirk's foot slip to I expect that's Klingon for 'hello'  this movie holds some of the most embarrassing moments in Star Trek.  I remember the butterflies in my stomach as Spock dives into this dumb scene with FX from Saturday morning.  The Nimbus bar (office for the delegates?) is a lame copy of the STAR WARS cantina.5.  DEFECTIVE ENTERPRISE This crew works at a disadvantage in every film but UNDISCOVERED......even GENERATIONS.  The broken ship is a tired device, and here it doesn't make sense. There's no relevance to the plot, except maybe the broken transporter. Other functions are played only for 'laughs'.6.  SUPPORTING CAST WASTED Sulu and Chekov lost! --hilarious! Uhura stripping!! --A riot!!  Scotty bangs his head! ...okay, that was actually pretty funny.  The director was not responsible for most trouble,  but he has no idea how to treat these characters.  Not realizing their value, he plays them either goofy or hypnotized.  A missed opportunity for drama in exposing their pain or portraying the forced betrayal of Kirk.  Remember Chekov's struggle in 'KHAN'.7.  KLINGONS Used only as a conflict device, they have no motivation given except to 'get Kirk'.  There could have been an effort to rescue Korrd or even direct orders from the Klingons to use the conflict as an excuse to entrap Kirk. (like UNDISCOVERED...)  I did like the use of Klingonese but if you follow closely, there's a Klingon word for Kalicams... which IS a Klingon word...8.  THE HANGER DECK The design department has no concept of perspective.  The look was great but the proportions are way off.  This contributes to a feeling that something is not right.  A well acted scene has the effect of a school play.  I was drawing technical plans for this stuff when I was 10!!  How could they be so far off.9.  I WANT JIM KIRK! The Admiral's reason for sending the undermanned Enterprise.  Why??  With Klingons involved, it means trouble.  Are we to believe the average Starship captain is THAT unprepared for this situation.  It would have made more sense if  Enterprise were the ONLY option.10.  SYBOK'S TAKEOVER Controlling the bridge, Sybok takes over.  Where is everybody? And why do crewmembers stand passively, listening to his message.  He relieved everyone's pain?  From here on, the story moves around the characters.  Scotty tries to animate things... until he's knocked out.11.  SPOCK'S BROTHER I'll accept that he has a half-brother we don't know about.  Sybok isn't the type of guy Spock would discuss.  But it's such an obvious device from which to squeeze drama.  Ooooh, conflict...HOW will Spock resolve this one.  The film suffers from too many plot contrivances for us to accept this on too.  No matter how good these two actors are.  (And they are good. When they first meet?  Golden!!)12. THE TURBOSHAFT CLIMB Dumb idea, bad FX, lame jokes.  ...and the floor numbers are wrong.13.  TOO MANY RED HERRINGS The significance of Nimbus, the ship's malfunctions, Spock's brother, hostages, etc.  These things don't affect the storyline in the end.  Take the SOS message from the Officers Lounge. This is intercepted by the Klingons (who already know where they are..) and serves only as a vehicle for Sybok to confront them.14.  THE GREAT BARRIER Another arbitrary plot device.  They zip through with no explanation as to how. Even if Sybok knew how, the Klingons follow with no problem.15.  DON'T JUST STAND THERE... GOD IS A BUSY MAN Don't just stand there????  Captain! The director has given us nothing to do!!16.  GOD-THING The film's lame effects especially disappoint here.  The GOD face is laughable.  Audiences can't believe they're viewing GOD, and guess what? It's not.  Confusion is inevitable.  If he's fake, make him a real fake!! (Remember Balok?) The concept of an alien being trapped on this planet and Sybok's willingness to believe should have been flushed out more.  McCoy asking, Is this the voice of God? was wrong.   That should have been Sybok.  The real story of the GOD-THING is left unclear.  It needed a Perry Mason type ending. There's just one thing I don't understand, Jim...17. GHOST ATTACK There's no ghosts in Star Trek.  Having 'something' shake the shuttle, chase Kirk, and make a lot of racket is a poor compromise of the Directors original idea's.18.  CONVENIENT KLINGON TORPEDO...which kills the transporter.   Now what??  Oh brother!  I was wise to that bit before I was in high school.19. THE CLIMAX The story falls apart from here. Klingons aren't needed here; they clutter up the action,  Kirk runs from... what? GOD lightning!  It sure has bad aim. The enemy saves the day.  The Klingon apology, and finally... Spock in the gunner chair.  All of this feels like the results of a 'we need an ending' meeting.  Although I like the exchange between Kirk and Spock, this could have taken place on the Enterprise.20.  THE SOLEMN ENDING Sybok is dead.  GOD doesn't live here.  The entire STORY has been a red herring.  Still... we have each other...  Star Trek movies aren't known for happy endings,  but this one's especially dark.  Cool Vulcan harp, though.
