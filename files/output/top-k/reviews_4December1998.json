It makes for a perfect flip-side companion piece to the little-seen Paul Greengrass film United 93. In the world of Exec Dec the heroes save the day and America wins. In United 93 (and the real world) life isn't that simple. But since this was made 5 years prior to 9\/11 it should be judged purely as entertainment and not as any political statement.Kurt Russell plays David Grant, a United States Naval Academy graduate who works as a counter-terrorist expert for Army Intelligence who is called into the Pentagon when a group of Muslim extremists taken over a flight from Athens to Washington DC. After blowing up the restaurant of the London Marriott, they demand that their recently captured terrorist leader El Sayed Jaffa (think O.B.L.) be released and that they be given millions of dollars in gold bullion. Grant, suspects that this is merely a ploy to get into US airspace to set off a massive bomb rigged with huge supply of DZ-5 poison gas.Their only apparent option is to blow the plane up over the ocean, killing everyone on-board and sending any evidence that they might have straight to the bottom of the Atlantic. But Colonel Travis (that's Steven Seagal folks!) suggests hooking up the 747 with a modified F-117x Remora stealth bomber while it's still in the air so he and his commandos can kick some terrorist ass. Dragged along for the ride, Grant and computer nerd Dennis Cahill (Oliver Platt) are to supervise the link-up and identify Cell Leader Nagi Hassan (David Suchet) from the Remora. But the link-up falters and only 4 commandos plus Grant and Cahill make it on-board. Travis is killed and the Remora is destroyed, along with most of their equipment.With only a few hours before the plane reaches US airspace and the bare-minimum of equipment the group have to sneak around in the crawlspaces of airplane attics, cargo bays, and elevator shafts searching for the bomb and spying on the terrorists.It's highly intense, superbly photographed and expertly edited entertainment. What first attracted me to Exec Dec was obviously the casting of Russell and Seagal but link-up with the Remora and the 747 is definitely one of the most unique action scenes in the past two decades and was the major selling point of the film for me.I do realize that Seagal has many critics and most of them judge him far, far to harshly and play up his character's death in this film claiming that the only good thing about Exec Dec is 'the death of Seagal 10 minutes into an extended cameo'. Which is a totally foolish and untrue thing to say. Seagal is in the movie for a full 45 minutes before he dies. Which was done to shock the audience into believing that if Seagal dies then any of the cast could be next. And even if you're a Seagal hater (understandable considering his recent poor output) don't let that overshadow the rest of the film which is, in it's final half-hour, so exciting that you'll be so on the edge of your seat that you won't actually be sitting on it.It does lose some of it's power when compared to the horror-show that is United 93, but like I said, they are either side of the same coin. In the world of Executive Decision the terrorist attacks of 9\/11 would never have happened. And if 9\/11 was an always inevitable event, then I guess the film IS far-fetched. But it was made pre-9\/11 for entertainment, nothing else, so I guess I can forgive it for being so.

Sure, it was technically sophisticated, but how was it that such a great reputation was bestowed on a film that was honestly just so weird-ass and boring???No dialogue for half an hour!F***ing apes running around hitting each other, and throwing sticks in the air!A mildly interesting segment with a mean-ass pod thing that tries to eat a spaceman, and a rad bit where one jumps into outer space, closes the door and all the sound turns on was the highlight of the movie.Then more bullshit!Weird noises and whines!Ten or twenty (felt like a hundred) minutes of flashing lights! Wakes up in an old room with an old man with a glass of wine! THEN A GIANT FLOATING PLANET BABY!!!WHAT WAS THIS BULLSHIT????This film LOOKED good, but made no sense whatsoever! And when a film made no sense when I was 13, I got bored! And when a film gets boring, that usually means it's ROOTED!!!My sister watched the film at about the same time, and I distinctly remember walking in during the movie's final moments and finding her sitting upside down on her head in her chair, apparently in an attempt to prevent her natural reflexes from clicking the 'eject' button.However, I read a bit about the film (What's this 'rebirth of man crap', and how was I supposed to think of that? I was thinking!) and optimistically kept a copy of the film in case it might have later value for me when I was older and wiser.As it turned out, I never watched that tape again. The years came and went, and I saw many more movies (insert nostalgic montage sequence here), read many more reviews, and the movie even came out in a new 70mm print at a few cinemas a couple of years ago. I can't remember the occasion, but the flyer (I have it blue-tacked to the roof above my bed, I collect that sort of crap) reads Happy Birthday Hal., but I still couldn't bring myself to sit through it again. And eventually, I realised that I needed to see it again, simply hoping to 'get it', suspecting that if I did, I might even like it.Then a 30th anniversary video edition came out in Widescreen, which I subsequently purchased and so it came to be that I viewed '2001 A Space Odyssey' the second time.And it blew my mind again.Every thing that I'd ever read about the film was right there before me, clear as day! Everything that I loved about Kubrick (by this stage I'd seen and loved Clockwork Orange, Spartacus, Full Metal Jacket, Barry Lyndon, and to a lesser extent The Shing and Lolita) was there, mechanical characters and direction expressing extraordinary themes. It was like Kubrick concentrate! I loved every single frame of the movie, it was like he'd taken every shots and scenes that grabbed me in ways I never realised why, from every movie I'd ever seen, and thrown them together in an editing suite into 2 and a bit hours worth that just happened to privilege the most important, mind-boggling, revolutionary, ambitious and all-encompassing themes ever existent.I'd crap on about what it means, but I don't really know. I could think about it for ages, but I'd just end up at the same place again. If you want to know what it means, try reading someone else's comments here! But I don't think anybody, including Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke know totally what it means, I don't think that is possible with any movie. It reads specifically to each person who sees it, like every film or text does. And I think I should shut up soon, but not before I make a couple of points.This is probably a rash statement, and I've been searching for holes in it and haven't found any yet. 2001 A Space Odyssey is the only true Science Fiction movie. If you take the Sci Fi from Star Wars (I film I admittedly love more, it is PERHAPS my all time favorite), you're left with what? An adventure movie, part western, part Japanese samurai film. If you take the Science Fiction out of 2001, you're left with nothing. 2001 IS science fiction.2001 A Space Odyssey is by critical consensus one of the best movies ever made (I'm sure you didn't know that), and one of the top five I have ever seen. I have placed the 'Keeping 2001 tape' incident as one of the wisest things I have ever done in my life, even if I ended up taping Hamburger Hill over it.Thanks for reading!I have now just realized that the time I spent writing this overlong review could have been better spent watching the movie again.

In any case, it really isn't a bad flick - I have about 3000 Batman comics, read 'em all, they haven't made A true Batman movie, but for the four that they have made - I'd rank this as #2 of the 4 - first being Batman (an 8 of 10), this one I rank a 7 and the two others 7's as well. Don't listen to the HATE BANDWAGON, give it a shot, if you're a Batman fan, you'll find a lot to like.-Kris  ","genre":"Action, Fantasy, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"4 December 1998","score":"9 out of 19 people found the following review useful","review":"  Hi - I'm surprised that everyone is jumping on the I hate this movie bandwagon.

The Weinsteins have done it again, and I for one, am grateful.  I always wondered what would become of Bubble from Absolutely Fabulous, and who knew Jane Horrocks had all of this in her? This role was perfect for her.  Ewan McGregor is always surprisingly different from one movie to the next.  Bravo for him for staying loyal to his Brassed Off director.  I suppose the big paycheck from Star Wars helps him keep it real.  Brenda Blethyn and Michael Caine are always good. Even when Brenda gets screechy, she's still funny and genuine.

While singing the praises of this movie, I feel I must rebutt some of the previous comments.  After 50 years, there is a widely held cultural context for the horrors of the Holocaust and the concentration camps, and I feel that Benigni is drawing on that in this film.  Do we really need to see the horrors and obscenity of the concentration camps again to know that they are there?  I think that bombarding the audience with horrific images can be a numbing experience, while subtle imagery (the cat searching for it's owner in the pile of clothing, the elderly and children undressing under the cold, steely gaze of the female guard, etc.) are enough to convey the complete inhumanity present.  If you really needed a little gore to convince you things were bad, there was the 2 story surreal pile of bodies emerging from the mist. Lack of gore should not be seen as a lack of condemnation of the horrors of the Holocaust, and its lack of such sets it apart from other films dealing with the same subject matter.
