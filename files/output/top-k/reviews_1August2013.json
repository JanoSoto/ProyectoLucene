[{"date":"1 August 2013","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Election (1999)Chipper, funny, clever, and well done. There are lots of exaggerated high school types (stereotypes) here, and the acting is generally wonderful. The election of the title is the voting for the school class president, and in this middle America setting there are lots of things to make fun of.The star is not one of the students, who are generally terrific, but a teacher who was in the middle of the action, Matthew Broderick. He's a decent presence, but depends on under playing things for laughs, and he's a lovable type. More interesting (and exaggerated) is Reese Witherspoon as the overachieving student who at first seems set to win the election hands down. She's funny, and convincing (even though she's a 23-year old playing a 17-year old).The challengers in the race are unlikely, funny underdogs. One is played by Chris Klein, a nice guy, a really really really nice guy (this comes into the final turn of events before the results are counted). I'm embarrassed to say I identified with him (which is not good for career development, believe me). He is also really likable and has lots of friends (I don't identify with that part), and so he's suddenly in contention. Then there is his sister, thrown into the race as a wild card, taking the stance that elections are stupid. Of course, her voters all probably boycott the balloting and you know how many votes she gets.But it gets vicious by an odd twist, and things get bad for everyone, somehow, including the teacher who tried to correct the results and, well, you'll see. It's all very funny, and silly. There is a subplot (a teacher-student fling) that intends to spice up the whole thing and this probably gets some laughs but it's forced and isn't followed up.You can easily draw flimsy parallels to our national elections with its own comedy, but this isn't a parody. It's just a situation ripe with low-hanging jokes. Which is pretty fun.
