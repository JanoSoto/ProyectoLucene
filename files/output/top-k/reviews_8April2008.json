Given the state of Hollywood today where everything is a remake or rehashed from something else, it's refreshing to see something totally original like Twin Falls Idaho. But not only does Twin Falls Idaho contain some good ideas, it's a well-crafted and utterly fascinating film.What would happen if you had to go everywhere and do everything with someone else? What would it be like? How would you do it? These are some of the questions that Twin Falls Idaho addresses. Blake and Francis Falls (Mark and Michael Polish in their writing and Michael's directing debut) are Siamese twins who have lived their whole lives attached to each other. But Francis is sick, and the brothers are determined to go out of this world together. Enter Penny, a prostitute who grows very close to them, and ends up falling for Blake.The beauty about this film is how it's constructed. The twins may be the film's focus, but Penny is our eyes. We know as much as she does, and her reactions are instantly relatable. She asks the questions that we want to ask, and the movie never gets ahead of the audience or vice versa. But the Polish brothers know that there is a story here, and they wisely focus on that. But they integrate being a Siamese twin flawlessly, and that's what raises this movie to another level.The acting by the three leads is outstanding. The Polish brothers are brilliant. They are so good at functioning as Siamese twins that it's almost impossible to believe that they are not really like that. The are used to all the questions, and the looks, and they are used to answering them, but the stares and pointing still hurt, and their desire for privacy is something they hold dear. Newcomer Michele Hicks equals them. A lesser talented actor would overact her emotions, but she understands the use of subtlety, and that's why the audience can relate to her. Everything about her character is real and genuine.Less impressive are two of the most important supporting characters, Sissy and Tre. Their desire to expose the twins (for shock value\/gossip as in Sissy's case, or money and publicity in Tre's case), come off as writer's constructs, and while the actions are genuine, the situations feel contrived (but the performances are good and very effective, especially Ant as Tre). But these missteps are saved by the performances of the other actors. Lesley Ann Warren fares better as Francine, the twins' mother who gave them up for adoption after they were born, but she's still not as good as the three principal characters. The other actors are great, such as Miles, the doctor friend of Penny's who helps her look after the twins. There are an assortment of oddball characters, but the actors keep them real and believable (unlike Wes Anderson or Terry Zwigoff).Michael Polish has the mark of a terrific director. The film is clearly a low budget indie film, but Polish makes the most of his budget so it doesn't seem like it. The tone is dark, yet strangely warm. This is a quiet movie, almost too quiet, but it helps establish the tone. Polish has respect for his material, and his film is about curiosity, and NEVER exploitative.Twin Falls Idaho isn't perfect, but the good aspects vastly outweigh its flaws. It's impossible to understand why this movie didn't get access to a wider audience, particularly since co-joined twins were, and still are, a slightly hot topic of the day. I can definitely say that this is a must-see film for everyone, especially since its messages of tolerance and respect have many parallels with today's world.

It increases the chances that the viewer will wish to watch them multiple times. Memento certainly fits this description. It is as cunning and unpredictable as any thriller I've seen, and it is one of the few films that can accurately claim Hitchcock's legacy. With so few films actually requiring audiences to think, Memento is a wonderful respite for those still concerned with the intellectual appeal of cinema.The film's strongest point is its plot which is both original and endearing. Leonard's investigations occur in color and in reverse chronological order. However, we are first presented with the event occurring in black and white which happens in chronological order. The effects of this plot structuring are exquisite. The film's progression mirrors Leonard's anterograde amnesia. In other words, Nolan tells the film both backwards and forwards simultaneously, thus each depiction of the plot adds believability to the other. Another strong point to the plot is the lack of a new love interest for Leonard. So many would-be-thrillers suffer from the unnecessary relationships which ruin the tension the film attempts to build. Even Hitchcock's films occasionally suffer from this occurrence. I suppose Christopher Nolan deserves even more credit since he wrote the screenplay. Unfortunately, the plot is difficult to follow the first time. Upon future viewings the plot will become clearer and even more satisfying.The other aspects of the film are obviously less pronounced, however, Guy Pearce does a wonderful job portraying Leonard. If the tattoos on his body are not evidence enough, then the realistic facial expressions and his genuine bewilderment is. This is method acting at its finest. Another way his performance is enhanced is the realistic setting design. The audience is not distracted by a fantastical setting which could have been employed. The room is cluttered and untidy as we would think it to be. The hotel manager takes advantage of Leonard's illness and charges him for two rooms, which only further enhances our relation to the movie. One of the definitive reasons that Memento is so entertaining and effective is that Nolan directs a man suffering with an uncommon disease in such as homely way anyone can sympathize with him and understand his plight.While Memento isn't the typical thriller, it breathes fresh air into a genre saturated with repetitive Bourne and Ocean's films. With Memento and The Prestige as successful films (I have not yet seen the later), Warner Brothers made a right decision to hand the Batman franchise to Nolan. I hope that his success will continue to revitalize the Dark Knight, but I doubt he will be able to create as intricate a plot as he did in Memento.

In other words, Nolan tells the film both backwards and forwards simultaneously, thus each depiction of the plot adds believability to the other. Another strong point to the plot is the lack of a new love interest for Leonard. So many would-be-thrillers suffer from the unnecessary relationships which ruin the tension the film attempts to build. Even Hitchcock's films occasionally suffer from this occurrence. I suppose Christopher Nolan deserves even more credit since he wrote the screenplay. Unfortunately, the plot is difficult to follow the first time. Upon future viewings the plot will become clearer and even more satisfying.The other aspects of the film are obviously less pronounced, however, Guy Pearce does a wonderful job portraying Leonard. If the tattoos on his body are not evidence enough, then the realistic facial expressions and his genuine bewilderment is. This is method acting at its finest. Another way his performance is enhanced is the realistic setting design. The audience is not distracted by a fantastical setting which could have been employed. The room is cluttered and untidy as we would think it to be. The hotel manager takes advantage of Leonard's illness and charges him for two rooms, which only further enhances our relation to the movie. One of the definitive reasons that Memento is so entertaining and effective is that Nolan directs a man suffering with an uncommon disease in such as homely way anyone can sympathize with him and understand his plight.While Memento isn't the typical thriller, it breathes fresh air into a genre saturated with repetitive Bourne and Ocean's films. With Memento and The Prestige as successful films (I have not yet seen the later), Warner Brothers made a right decision to hand the Batman franchise to Nolan. I hope that his success will continue to revitalize the Dark Knight, but I doubt he will be able to create as intricate a plot as he did in Memento.

You might laugh and ignore the comment and read something else but I think that you might have to re watch the film with a different lens to appreciated it fully. Now I know that there is no Odessa Steps in Rocky so don't laugh. One reason that I love the film so much is that the message is so simple that anyone, including children, can grab hold of it. You can't say that for Potemkin. Another reason is that the film is completely heart and shows a character that is down and out. The character comes from no where and has nothing except love in his heart for a regular looking women. So typology is something that Potemkin and Rocky share, that is to Rocky's credit. The scenes consist of seemingly everyday conversations with everyday thoughts, nothing profound is said, at least not on the surface. What is really being said here that the America Dream is alive and well, honestly that was said more in the sequels but I'm talking about the original movie. What I think is being said is that in life we go the distance. Rocky doesn't win the match, he simply goes the distance when no one except a handful of people told him that he could even fight Apollo Creed. That is the magic of the movie the magic is that we all have the ability to fight the good fight in life.

In retrospect it is just your typical Hollywood, big-budget movie attempting to cash-in on an already successful franchise, but at the the same time, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. If it was a bad movie then obviously I'd think differently, but it's not at all! The cinematography in this movie is very well put together and the soundtrack score works really well also. In effect this all adds to a really good sense of atmosphere, portraying the classic good (Hunt) and evil (Ambrose). This is all held together by Nyah Nordoff Hall (Thandie Newton), an ex-girlfriend of Ambrose's and a new love interest for Hunt, which I'd say holds up pretty well. The action sequences are well put together, from the scenes in Utah with Cruise free-climbing a Mesa, the Biocyte skyscraper scene, to the Bare island scene..all well done I think.Overall MI2 is an easy watching movie.

So it is funny and that is not a surprise. Mel Brooks knows how to make things both funny and silly so that we can gargle with giggles and barf with laughter. But the film has the main defect all Mel Brooks's films have. The humor is essentially punctual, so we have one joke after another, one smile after another, one pleasant moment after another, but there is no structural derision of the models. The final birth of an alien is funny both because of the situation in which it happens and it surprises us then, and because the alien is turned into some kind of long-tailed Fred Astaire or Zizi Jeanmaire. With a few bananas it could have impersonated Josephine Baker. The River Kwai song is funny because it surprises us too especially since we were expecting seven dwarfs and their song when going down to the mine. But that is all. Beyond this fun nothing, zilch. And that's a shame because the subject could have been a real mine of structural humor against these big space sagas that process the audience into some kind of slightly, and even at times a lot, intellectually and culturally retarded people.

A genuinely creepy and disturbing film, this tells the tale of mad doctor whose obsession with getting his daughter a new face turns murderous. Story-wise, this is highly original and amazingly interesting. It is a story of love, obsession and murder with a rather poetic and surreal feel. The three main actors are brilliant, just perfect! Pierre Brasseur is Docteur Génessier, the father who is ridden with guilt after a car crash which destroys his daughter's face. Brasseur is so good in his role, he gives what could have been a clichéd mad doctor into a human with a conscience, with feelings, someone to pity. Edith Scob is Christiane Génessier, the daughter without a face. She is beautiful in her tragic role, the final scene is beautiful, a real tearjerker. Finally, Alida Valli is Louise, Dr. Genessier's assistant. She has this somewhat innocence and charm about her, although at times she conveys a rather sinister aura.However, it is not just these three amazing actors that make this film the masterpiece it is. The haunting score, which sounds very much like circus music, is a foreshadowing to the circus of horrors we are about to witness the doctor perform. Furthermore, the gorgeous cinematography (thanks to Eugen Schüfftan) gives the movie a serene and melancholy feel. But, in one or two scenes, it also gives the movie a eerie and creepy vibe. Black and white is used exceptionally well and complements the look of the film. Of course, Franju should get a huge mention, as his direction is smooth, focused and flawless.Last but not least, the special effects for a 1960 film are quite astounding really. The surgery scene is graphic and surprisingly made me very uncomfortable. Overall, I would recommend this gem to any fan of French cinema, surreal and expressionist horror or great movies! 4½\/5 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 April 2008","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Georges Franju's 'Les Yeux sans visage' (or Eyes Without a Face) is one of the most important horror films made.

Brasseur is so good in his role, he gives what could have been a clichéd mad doctor into a human with a conscience, with feelings, someone to pity. Edith Scob is Christiane Génessier, the daughter without a face. She is beautiful in her tragic role, the final scene is beautiful, a real tearjerker. Finally, Alida Valli is Louise, Dr. Genessier's assistant. She has this somewhat innocence and charm about her, although at times she conveys a rather sinister aura.However, it is not just these three amazing actors that make this film the masterpiece it is. The haunting score, which sounds very much like circus music, is a foreshadowing to the circus of horrors we are about to witness the doctor perform. Furthermore, the gorgeous cinematography (thanks to Eugen Schüfftan) gives the movie a serene and melancholy feel. But, in one or two scenes, it also gives the movie a eerie and creepy vibe. Black and white is used exceptionally well and complements the look of the film. Of course, Franju should get a huge mention, as his direction is smooth, focused and flawless.Last but not least, the special effects for a 1960 film are quite astounding really.

It's the story of a small group of Allied soldiers, led by Sergeant Joe Gunn (Humphrey Bogart), lost in the Libyan desert, who are determined to defend a small outpost against a battalion of Germans. The outpost has a well, but the well is almost dry. It produces only drops of water. Joe and his comrades will use the promise of water to delay the Germans, fighting them off in an almost hopeless battle, to give the Allies after the fall of Tobruk a chance to regroup. Sahara hits its marks to get all of us civilians back home a reason to be proud of our fighting men, to be resolute in the fight against the Germans, and to dedicate ourselves to do what we must to win. Let's see. We've got Humphrey Bogart leading us. His Joe Gunn is sympathetic, tough and smart, a natural leader, and at heart Gunn is just an average guy. The men he winds up leading are his tank crew and a collection of men from other countries he encounters in the desert. They come from Brooklyn, of course, and from Texas, from London, South Africa, Dublin, France, the Sudan. We have the black Sudanese portrayed as a resourceful and brave man, not as comedy relief, who not only develops a friendship with the Texan but who twice saves the day for his comrades. We have an Italian prisoner who represents an Italy which is oppressed by the Germans, and a Nazi prisoner who is arrogant and vicious. We have a battle in which ingenuity and bravery manage to hold off brutal frontal attacks. And we have good men dying for a cause which is larger than they are. Sergeant Gunn calls everyone together in the blazing sun just outside the mud-brick outpost to explain what he wants to do against the oncoming battalion of Germans. He intends that they will fight to hold off and delay the enemy. He has fewer than ten men. The Germans have several hundred. I look at it this way, he tells the group. Because it is a 100-to-one shot, because it is so much more than line-of-duty, because there's so little chance of us coming out of it, I felt I ought to put it up to you. You've all got families at home, wives, mothers, sweethearts. I ain't got none, so it doesn't matter about me. I know how you feel about 'em...maybe havin' none I know even better. What you decide, you'd better decide quick. One British soldier speaks up, Well, nobody minds giving his life, but this is throwing it away. Why? Why? Joe answers, Why did your people go about their business when the Germans were throwing everything in the book at 'em? Why did your little boats take the men off the beach at Dunkirk? Why did the Russians make a stand at Moscow? Why did the Chinese move whole cities thousands of miles inland when the Japs attacked 'em? Why Bataan? Why Corregidor? Maybe they were all nuts but there's one thing they did do. They delayed the enemy and kept on delayin' 'em until we got strong enough to hit 'em harder than they were hittin' us. I ain't no general, but it seems to me that's one way to win. The first third of the movie is Joe, his tank and his crew, trying to find their way back to their lines and slowly gathering up the others. They are attacked by a German fighter and have to keep moving through a scouring sandstorm. The middle of the film is spent watching their struggle to collect the few drops of water coming from the well. More importantly, now we get to know most of the men as individuals. We also get to know just how dangerous the Nazi prisoner is. And the last third is a rouser...the preparation for what appears to be a hopeless battle, the dedication of the men as they fight and die, and then the final victory. There's no false heroics about Joe Gunn. He's just a gritty sergeant who rises to the occasion. With the exception of J. Carrol Naish, who gives one of his over-played little-man Italian performances, the actors all do fine jobs. I particularly liked Dan Duryea, Rex Ingram and Louis Mercier. One other thought.

I'm really loathe to add this codicil. Yet for all that I was absorbed, I had to suspend my disbelief too often.Sinatra is the prinicpal offender in this respect, although, typically, he also shows flashes of cool, menace and an adroit masculinity that makes you wish for more. Laurence Harvey's Shaw carries the picture with a characterisiation that manages to be less believable at exactly the same pace as his mind unravels (so, an indication that my misgivings are my own problem!).There is little that can be said in flat criticism of Angela Lansbury's toxic Harpy of a mother to Harvey's Shaw though.
