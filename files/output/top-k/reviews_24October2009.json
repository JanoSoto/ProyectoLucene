About the press in Park Row, about pulpy crime stories like those he wrote in Crimson Kimono, about war in a dozen of his movies. The Big Red One may be the most personal of all because he fought with the actual Big Red One in WWII. Those who have a passing knowledge of Fuller's persona will recognize him in Pvt Zab chewing down the end of a cigar throughout the movie. Sam Fuller himself appears as a newsreel cameraman later on. Lee Marvin, aged though he may have been for his role, was another WWII veteran and he was shot in the Pacific in much the same way he's shot in the movie. Now all the jigsaw pieces start coming together to reveal what kind of movie this is.If it appears a bit anachronistic for its time, in its bland score and vivid bright colors that seem to have escaped from a 60's movie, two years later than Apocalypse Now, five years before Full Metal Jacket, that's because it is. It's not a movie made by young people and it doesn't set out to deconstruct the war movie or search for the primeval archetype behind war the way Coppola did in the jungles of the Philippines. It's wholesome in its own episodic way, a journey of sorts that takes us from the deserts of Algeria to the landings in Sicily and Omaha beach to the heart of the beast, the crematoriums of Germany. In its own syncopated way, this is no less a journey to the heart of darkness than Apocalypse Now was. The conclusion is not mystical but it's full of raw humanity. The scope is broad (WWII in all the different battlefields of Europe) but the focus is narrow (on a small company of four young bucks and their scruffy sergeant who's haunted by demons he first encountered in a WWI battlefield). In all the various set pieces we're taken through the emphasis remains on the nailbiting buildup, the suspense and the constant waiting to kill or be killed by a stray nameless bullet, rather than a panoramic outcome of a war won or lost. Indeed, when the war ends, the soldiers only find out about it through flyers dropped from the sky, some of them even too late. Fuller experienced war firsthand and he knows war is more about constant nerve-wracking waiting than spectacular action. Being a director of the old brigade of course he stuffs the movie full of everything. Action and humor, drama and suspense, all side by side yet nothing feels misplaced or redundant, even the raid on an insane asylum takes a curious poignant turn by the end when an inmate grabs a semi-automatic and starts firing wildly at the walls yelling I am sane now. The question the movie asks is simple enough is war cold blooded murder or a form of killing necessitated by some kind of design and how far is one from the other? And even though we never become as intimate with the small group of soldiers as we do with the privates in the PBR boat in Apocalypse Now or the platoon in the boot camp of Full Metal Jacket, by the end, when a private discovers a Nazi soldier hiding inside a crematorium and Lee Marvin's sergeant takes care of a Jewish child survivor of some concentration camp, the movie emerges as poignant an indictment on the madness and despair of war as any that came before or after. Fuller made several great war movies (The Steel Helmet and Fixed Bayonets! best among them), but this may very well be his masterpiece.

I mean, everyone is great in their parts, and the older generation in the 1960s is captured too well for words, the falseness, the materialism. But young Hoffman as awkward, yearning Ben, with a foot in old and new generations (it's 1967 and he's no hippie, but he longs to break away), makes you really feel his entrapment, and his liberation by the end. And Anne Bancroft is easily his equal, as an actress, and her own entrapment as the well-to-do and unhappy Mrs. Robinson, and her ability to lever a way free, is also palpable. All of this is a marvel to watch.It's so easy to like the plot of this film, some of the other innovations get lost, like the lighting, which is daring and beautiful with its willingness to avoid mere prettiness. When the father is scolding Ben in the pool, the sunlight glares behind his head. When Ben and Mrs. Robinson are in the hotel room, whole scenes go on in darkness and we only listen. The photography overall uses this lighting and extends the takes to an almost uncanny extent, so that conversations go on very long--many minutes--with seeming directorial ease (and therefore growing tension in the frame). The writing, too, is masterful. The plot is wild enough for its time, or ours, and is handled with such matter of factness (old woman seducing a completely wile-less younger man, really now). But it's funny! Really really funny. Director Mike Nichols started as a comedian of course, partnered with Elaine Mays, and the subtle, deft handling of unlikely comebacks is both realistic and hilarious and fraught with anxiety. He's one of those directors who understands human interaction, dialog as well as silence, with vivid, subtle keenness (he made many other actor's films, the breathtaking Closer and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf for starters). Nichols uses Hoffman most of all to lead us through the topsy turvy plot.You can't forget the social commentary here, one of the best illustrations of a generation breaking free and the reasons why. It's about the generation gap, about finding what matters beyond materialism. It's about young people having enough money to not worry about survival. It's about true love without calculation, whatever the impulsiveness, and whatever the prospects of their success as a couple. And all of this is done without preachiness (notice the cross in the almost last scene) and without emotional distance. Remember, this was filmed while it was happening--the 60s are still unfinished, and their meaning undigested. There is, thankfully, no nostalgia.I've seen this film several times over the years, but it has been awhile, and I was prepared to find holes in it, or a flagging pace, or something imperfect. And I didn't. Do I like Katherine Ross in particular as the girlfriend-to-be? Not really, but she's a type that makes sense for the year. Is the music plugged in and out logically or elegantly? Well, Simon and Garfunkle's attitude and introspection makes sense, adding to the mood perfectly, and it is fit into some of the scenes like a choreographed film score (as when the car runs out of gas). Fans will note that the versions of Mrs. Robinson are very different than the album releases. But songs are repeated, sometimes a lot, and you wonder exactly why.But so what? These are the oddities that make the film more distinctive and, in a way, more memorable.

Even most of a century later, the visuals are stunning and the special effects impressive. I'm not usually overly impressed by such things, but what everyone says is true, it really is a feast for the eyes. And it was a landmark film, extremely influential.And as long as I'm pointing out the good things, let me say that I also thought the original score was excellent. And while, as many have pointed out, the pacing is painfully slow through most of the film, I will say that, towards the end, when the plot is climaxing, the story really picks up the pace and actually becomes rather exciting.But it's still an awful movie.The plot is stupid, contorted, and contrived. The characters stock, insipid, or cardboard. The themes are an unsavory amalgam of socialism, ludditism, and religion, three things I detest. The society portrayed makes no sense. Perhaps my favorite pet dumbism is the stupid machine that Our Hero takes over, which looks like a giant clock, where he has to keep swinging the arms to align with ever-changing blinking lights, a task which manages to nearly overwhelm two different men during one 10-hour shift with its excessive physical demands. Yet, this crucial Super Future High-tech device from this Super Future High-tech society that's causing incalculable suffering to the poor, downtrodden workers... took me all of 2 minutes to figure out how to automate, using technology entirely available in 1927 when they made the film. There's just no good reason for people to be tortured spinning big, heavy dials, when simple electo-magnets would get the job done cheaply, easily, safely, and vastly more reliably. But as someone else pointed out, the machinery all appears to have been designed to torture the workers rather than do anything useful.And all of this, to put forward the imbecilic message of the film, with which we are bludgeoned with all the subtlety of brass knuckles THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN HEAD AND HANDS MUST BE THE HEART!

Or more explicitly, it's neither Independence Day nor Titanic. And serious drama's marriage with Science Fiction had not been very successful with a few exceptions like Blade Runner. And Gattaca is not intended for 11-year-old.However, after all these years I only regret I didn't see Gattaca earlier. This movie had so much great qualities. From the very beginning, Gattaca had provided the audiences with a sad, blusman-like undertone in which the story expanded. Ethan Hawk's role had a puny, weak feeling attached, echoing the the millions of nobodies outside the big screen. When the story entered the 2nd Act, this sad, lament-like tone even sharpened like a very accurate prediction to the near-future, or more accurately, to our very present. Yes, Gattaca is probably the most beautiful lament for human civilization, explaining its crude, inhuman nature and the human souls' struggles in it. Nowadays it's the information era that whoever controls the information controls the world, and Gattaca built its concept on modern days and even expanded it further in a totally convincing way. Actually one can complain about the technically obsoleted visions for futuristic technologies, like the computers Ethan Hawke used are totally like kindergarten stuffs in a 2009 perspective. But anyone paying too much attention to those things very sadly missed the point of Gattaca. With limited budget and scale, it actually managed to absorb everything a functional society can offer into its simplistic but beautiful scenes. Like if you notice, the polluted, green-colored sea and the lifeless, metallic streets can make you sigh, and certainly touches your heart in a different approach than Star Wars or Aliens. Gattaca is a proof that a great sci-fi movie doesn't have to have flying cars or big explosions.I don't want to expose too much of the story, but can only tell you that this is probably the most stunning and convincing sci-fi story ever told on the big screen. Our world had long been dragged in that way for too long and this movie only followed the world's pattern and asked several hypothetical questions. The result? You will be awed. Phillip K Dick will also smile if he saw this.The characters are all great thanks to the superb directing and performances. Ethan Hawke for instance is great in his nervous, witted impersonating character, reflecting Jude Law's pessimistic and broken role. Uma Thurman and Hawke were really very electrical and made the audiences speculate in as many ways as the director wanted them to. Still, the supporting cast was also superb, drawing this beautiful pictures from all directions, and finally accomplished this one of a kind sci-fi story.I am actually lucky to see this movie back to back with Simone, which was also directed by Andrew Niccol. Now the two movies are both in my favorite Sci-fi collection.10\/10. It deserved more attention by Academy than just Art Decoration set.

Ethan Hawk's role had a puny, weak feeling attached, echoing the the millions of nobodies outside the big screen. When the story entered the 2nd Act, this sad, lament-like tone even sharpened like a very accurate prediction to the near-future, or more accurately, to our very present. Yes, Gattaca is probably the most beautiful lament for human civilization, explaining its crude, inhuman nature and the human souls' struggles in it. Nowadays it's the information era that whoever controls the information controls the world, and Gattaca built its concept on modern days and even expanded it further in a totally convincing way. Actually one can complain about the technically obsoleted visions for futuristic technologies, like the computers Ethan Hawke used are totally like kindergarten stuffs in a 2009 perspective. But anyone paying too much attention to those things very sadly missed the point of Gattaca. With limited budget and scale, it actually managed to absorb everything a functional society can offer into its simplistic but beautiful scenes. Like if you notice, the polluted, green-colored sea and the lifeless, metallic streets can make you sigh, and certainly touches your heart in a different approach than Star Wars or Aliens. Gattaca is a proof that a great sci-fi movie doesn't have to have flying cars or big explosions.I don't want to expose too much of the story, but can only tell you that this is probably the most stunning and convincing sci-fi story ever told on the big screen. Our world had long been dragged in that way for too long and this movie only followed the world's pattern and asked several hypothetical questions. The result? You will be awed. Phillip K Dick will also smile if he saw this.The characters are all great thanks to the superb directing and performances. Ethan Hawke for instance is great in his nervous, witted impersonating character, reflecting Jude Law's pessimistic and broken role. Uma Thurman and Hawke were really very electrical and made the audiences speculate in as many ways as the director wanted them to. Still, the supporting cast was also superb, drawing this beautiful pictures from all directions, and finally accomplished this one of a kind sci-fi story.I am actually lucky to see this movie back to back with Simone, which was also directed by Andrew Niccol.

Or more explicitly, it's neither Independence Day nor Titanic. And serious drama's marriage with Science Fiction had not been very successful with a few exceptions like Blade Runner.

I will admit I wasn't expecting much after reading some very negative reviews on IMDb, but I do think this particular instalment did in some ways exceed my expectations and disappointed as well. On a visual and technical level, it looks absolutely fantastic, with splendid special effects, stunning cinematography and fine scenery and costumes. The script is fairly decent, perhaps lacking the sophistication of Empire Strikes Back or New Hope, but does have some memorable lines. The action is constantly exhilarating, and Darth Maul, well played by Ray Park is a very good villain. Of course though, Darth Vader is better. Most of the performances are very good, especially Natalie Portman as Queen Padma who looked stunning and Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker who shone with his confident charm. And Jar Jar Binks is okay on the most part, and you have to love Yoda. And the music score by John Williams was outstanding, definitely one of his best works. The quality of sound and direction are also impressive. However, there were things about this film that did disappoint. One is despite the awesome visuals, strong music score and good characters, the story never quite distinguished itself. It did take a while to get going, and when it did try to get going and you could tell it wanted to, it was further disadvantaged by the uneven pacing. Liam Neeson is a fine actor, his performances in Kinsey and Schindler's List are proof of that, and I do like Ewan McGregor. But as Qui-Gon Jin and Obi Wan Kenobi, both stars give unusually wooden performances, and at times looked even embarrassed.

I rented this movie religiously as a kid along with Mad Max and Big Trouble in Little China. My mom use to say your renting phantasm 2 again??. But something shell never understand is the blood lust one gets from taking in a movie of such magnitude. Many of my friends growing up never saw this movie, and I'm not sure exactly where i first saw it. This movie packs a wallop, lots of blood of all colors, exploding body's, sinister images of graveyards and corpses. Yeah its a real treat for any fan of true horror take notice BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOY.

In this movie the killer this time is really Jason, while in the first movie it was still never the film-makers their intention to make of the Jason character a serial killer to make an entire movie franchise out of.The movie is like everything you can expect from a genre movie and it's mostly being very formulaic. Fans of the genre will find very little true originality in this one and also little surprises in it's build up and execution. Again it's mostly a movie that is all about a bunch of young people being killed one by one, while they are at a camp, nearby the Camp Crystal Lake from the first movie, despite old cycling crazy Ralph's warnings.So the movie does very little original or surprising but it also does very little wrong. That means that this movie is simply an enjoyable and also good enough genre piece to watch. As a sequel it also serves its purpose at further expanding the Jason Voorhees rampage and set the tone for its further sequels. After this movie it became all the more obvious they had all the intentions of turning this into a long running series of movies. i just wished some of the killings within this movie would had been a bit more original. It's strange that in this movie some characters are being killed in the same way. Also lots of blood and gore got cut from the eventual print, to avoid getting a X rating. It has as a result that the movie is fairly tame with its graphic killings and blood. You really feel that they were holding back, while watching this movie, also with its nudity.A typical genre movie that does very little wrong but also offers little originality within its genre6\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"24 October 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This movie continues the Friday the 13th franchise and set the standards for all of the later sequels.
