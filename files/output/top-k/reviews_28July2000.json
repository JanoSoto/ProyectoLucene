In fact if i hadn´t bought the DVD, i probably wouldn´t have watched it, and i would ended up missing one of the most beautiful movies i ever made. David Lynch, working for Disney ?! The most politicaly correct movie company ever ?! The only comparison for this must be, if the Pope sudenly got chosen to be the next Dalai Lama !!! -)Come on, someone must be kidding ! For a second i though i had bought the wrong DVD and i had bought a new Leslie Nielsen comedy instead. Well i couldn´t be more wrong, because this movie is all that i was never expecting it to be. THE STRAIGHT STORY, is one of those very rare movies that can´t be explained, it has to be felt. And so if you will like it or not, will depend mostly upon your view of life and how you feel about your own personal values.By now i´ve already seen this movie about 4 or 5 times since i bought it about a month ago and i can´t get enough of it. Each time i get sad, or tired i just put this one and get carried away by it one more time. Because let me tell you, if you like this movie, every time you start watching it, you just can´t stop untill you´ve finished. Mainly because of Richard Farnsworth. Even today i still have trouble in convincing myself that the Alvin Straight in this movie is nothing but an actor playing a character. Richard´s performance is probably the best i ever seen in my life, because we totaly forget that everything in the screen is not real. Simply brilliant. Words can not describe it, once again it´s something that has to be felt.And as if this wasn´t enough, there´s Sissy Spacek, playing one of the most touching and simple characters i ever saw. This woman also deserved a bunch of awards, in fact everyone on this film deserved to go home with plenty of prizes and recognitions. The final minutes with Harry Dean Stanton playing Alvin´s brother are simply breathtaking. Never so many things were said in so few lines of dialogue.If there´s a movie that proves how fake the Oscars are, this is it.Oh,and let´s not forgget about the magnificent soundtrack. Angelo Badalamenti, does a superior work here. Probably his best. This has to be one best soundtracks ever, not because it stays in your mind afterwards, but because it works like magic in the movie. Never intrusive, and totaly beautiful !Go see this movie. And if you think this is another soapy drama, forget it. Emotion here is not flashed right into your eyes all the time. It doesn´t show to yourself, it makes you also feel instead. And this is what makes this movie great. Not what it shows, but what we know is there. Go feel this movie. It´s that good.

Too many characters would have been too confusing.

Besides, what were you expecting? William Shakespeare?iv) It's got lots of special effects and sfx, but could you really have a movie without them? Bet the same people complaining it was all special effects and no plot would be the same people that would have been complaining if it had a good story and no special effects.

You feel bad for Kirsten's father who blames it on Joe and for their daughter Debbie who wishes they could be togehter again.  And once Joe is clean it's up to Kirsten to get the family back.  It's a heartbreaking story that is still known today as one of the best films ever  made.

You say no? I say CRADLE WILL ROCK!I appreciate Tim Robbins liberal leanings and his pro-artist stance. Rich white guys and the actor's union are both cast as bad guys here. Hooray for that. But that does not, in and of itself, make a good movie. Here, in fact, it makes an bad one. A shamefully bad one.First off, the movie has no heart, no center. There's lots of stories, but little actual character development. You never get to know these people as people. What you get is lots of wooden  dialogue where everyone reveals their political leanings. You get some potentially interesting stuff-John Turturro, Emily Watson, and John Cusack provide some humanity-but its lost in lots of clunky overbaked drama. For instance, poor Hank Azaria plays the guy who writes the title play, and all you see of him is a few scenes of him interacting with the ghosts of his past. You never get to know him beyond these scenes. These ghosts are a lady in a bride's dress and a European Kurt Weill-type fellow. You have to see these scenes to understand. They're staged in a goofy theatrical way, but that kind of hammy experimental theatre that makes you hate all theatre people. They made me giggle and feel shame. Deep shame. Which brings up another pointThe movie turns into a bad European film all the time. I'm not slamming European films as a whole. I have seen many a fine moving film from the Continent. Europeans in these wonderful films seem to have a deeper emotional capacity Americans are unfamiliar with, like the rules of soccer. I'm talking about the kind of cold, weird, artsy, stylized, whimsical, clown-filled European films that steer most of America towards Bruce Willis movies. This film takes on that tone over and over. I mean, you have a scene approaching some level of actual emotion, and wham! Clowns! Whimsy! Overacting! The last sequence of the movie is a procession of vaudeville performers-its dirty with clowns, I tell you!-bearing a coffin of a ventriloquist dummy through the streets! Merde! Shame!Let me talk about the performances. We have a lot of good actors in the movie. Some of them do well. Some do not. Most of the performances here are irritating. Vanessa Redgrave acts like Lovey from Gilligan's Island for most of the movie, then gets caught up in the cause at the end and gets so full of the joy of life, I wanted to bludgeon her. Paul Giamatti is actually annoying, no small feat for this wonderful actor. But, I don't blame these actors. They were directed to be over the top and cartoony. Two exceptions. Angus MacFayden as Orson Welles and Cary Elwes as John Houseman. Orson Welles was a serious, intense, charming visionary, not an overblown buffoonish chimp. Cary Elwes- how do you get work? Seriously. Deep shame!Finally-as I have worked myself into a froth-I blame Tim Robbins. He wrote and directed this sucker. Wrote the bad dialogue. Directed the horribly executed scenes. And his wife sings over the ending credits. The movie was obviously his pet project. That's always a scary prospect. Good directors can go bad really fast with pet projects. Steven Spielberg with ALWAYS and HOOK. John Boorman with WHERE THE HEART IS. Kevin Costner with THE POSTMAN(he sings over the end credits!). And now Tim Robbins, a terrific actor, the wonderful director of DEAD MAN WALKING, has gone to that dark well of shame with this pompous dud.  Tim-please come back soon! We're waiting for you...
