When I watch a movie, especially this type of movie (high school\/romantic comedy), I don't usually want to see a documentary. If you like watching a feel good movie, there are a lot of reasons to watch this movie.The movie has a message of redemption, in that a woman, with a terrible teenage-hood\/high school experience of having pranksters torture her, gets to relive high school and gets to set it straight.The movie sends a powerful overarching message, loudly and well stated by Drew Barrymore's character Josie. She tells off the prankster girls for trying to pull a prank at the prom on the pretty nerd, by saying some people will always try to put others down, but putting people down does not make them better. By telling them off, she set it straight and what she says is the truth, despite the unrealistic nature of this movie.But the main reason, I like to re-watch this movie over and over again is two seconds of music from a song I heard many times on the radio, but never seemed to hear the notes, I hear when it plays in the climax of this movie.During the movie's climactic scene Josie (Drew Barrymore) stands on the pitcher's mound prior to a big high school baseball championship game waiting for a man, who she accidentally hurt, to come give her, her first kiss. She hopes he will come within a five minute window, prior to the big game. She had previously written a newspaper article to make this a public event. Many people turn out to see it. They cheer for her. She puts five minutes on a clock and waits. The five minutes pass, the cheering turns to sad sounds, the crowd grows quiet, and then (if you watch this movie you should turn the volume up here and watch this scene for yourself and listen to the sounds you'll hear combined with the sights you'll see, at this point). Yeah it's predictable. So what? Most good movies are. The action of the scene and the background sounds are choreographed perfectly to the song. The last lines represent a fantastic summary of the movie and are said well.I rate the movie an eight because, it does drag at points, but I never get tired of watching that climactic scene.For those of you who really don't want to watch it, I'll add a big spoiler here (Don't read this if you intend to watch this movie)At the point just after the crowd goes sad and silent, the crowd suddenly begins to cheer again. The camera searches and we also see Josie searching through the stands but we see no one. The song Don't Worry Baby by the Beachboys begins. Then the camera finds the guy. It is the guy Josie wants to come to kiss her. He comes running out of the stands to the pitchers mound and at the second before the kiss, the familiar song suddenly has a string\/violin section which makes a sudden build to a crischendo climax (I never heard this string crischendo before). At the same time, we are looking at the couple with the camera on his back and at Josie's face and Josie during the build up to the crishendo suddenly looks up at him with tremendous excitement in her eyes. Then he kisses her, and the crowd cheering noise hit a tremendous a crischendo with the crischendo of the the strings. After a long passionate kiss he comments Sorry about being late; it took forever getting here. She comments I know the feeling. They continue kissing for several more moments, as the crowd continues frantic cheering and the song plays out.It's definitely worth watching, and I don't care how predictable or unrealistic it is.

That's why we don't f****** learn English!), and I saw it immediately. After seeing, finally, My Best Friend's Birthday (the basis of the script of True Romance) I had desires to watch for the second time this film (pretty much back in 2007 I liked it but not really as much as any other film that I would like to watch more than once) and I finally did so last night.

Clarence is a guy who will f*** all of his possibilities to make out with a nice chick by inviting her to a Kung Fu night at the cinema (you wanna take me to a Kung Fu movie?, asks the probable date of our hero and he f****** gains us more yet and certainly not her once he responds to her question, he goes like three Kung Fu movies), and who will be in his birthday, just like every year, having a good time at the cinema (fortunately the DVD of The Street Fighter is there on my shelf just waiting!) but then it happens, a dream comes true, it's paid but nevertheless it's a dream come true!

Oh and for us The Wire fans there's Paul Ben-Victor, aka Spiros Vondas, also as a mafioso). Seeing the film in 2009 is of course seeing a film full of real Hollywood stars yet is not seeing a film full of truly great acting. All of them are okay and most of them have at least a memorable bit. Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper stands out for the part in which we confirm two things and both Brad Pitt (minor role but very funny and quite relevant even though he never goes out of his place) and Gary Oldman delivers a lot of fun... the rest, well like I said they all are okay (it's nice having Elvis, by the way).And just like its performances for me True Romance is not a truly brilliant masterpiece (or a film I would like to watch again and again) but a fun ride nevertheless.

But Spaceballs is, if not his finest hour, one of the top three efforts in his long list of satirizing comedies. And geek culture would never be the same.Basically parodying the original Star Wars saga, but mixing in elements of other sci-fi mainstays, like Star Trek, Alien and others, Brooks employs his twisted skills to skewer one of the most beloved and well-known franchises in movie history and does so masterfully. There are plenty of sight-gags and word play moments, as is expected in a Mel Brooks comedy. I especially liked all the Spaceballs merchandise that constantly shows up in the film. From bed sheets to toilet paper, it's one of several running gags that I never get tired of.It features some early work by Bill Pullman and Daphne Zuniga, who would both move on to bigger things in the future. Here, they have a perfect chemistry, as the snobby-but-yielding Princess and the rugged-but-tender hero. I like that, even before they fall for each other, they already argue like an old married couple.The main stars here, though, are (the late) John Candy and Rick Moranis, both of whom are staples in the world of the 80's comedy film. John Candy has some nice scenes and gets some yuks going, but it is Rick Moranis, as the evil-but-inept Lord Dark Helmet, who basically steals the show. Most of the funniest moment and lines belong to him. From playing with his Spaceballs dolls, to having his men (literally) combing the desert for our heroes, he proves that, even in a total farce, evil is always the more interesting and fun to watch.Many others have tried to imitate Brooks style of comedic humor, most notably Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, but try as others might, they simply cannot compete with the master. Because the one thing that Mel Brooks comedy spoofs do, that others do not, is know when to not go there. His humor is tactless, without ever being tasteless.

I know there's a market for three-hanky flicks and Chris Columbus (his company name 1492) is a Spielberg protégé out to make money not history, but give us a break. Do people really exchange snippets of cracker-barrel wisdom from morning until night? Evidently the half-dozen unknown writers who worked on this derivative script thought so, but I beg to differ.Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts ploughed some of their hugely-inflated earnings into this crowd-pleaser, but no amount of emoting by Sarandon can overcome the sad fact that her character looks about 15 years too old to have a seven year-old child. She resembles his grandma. Moreover, her character exists in limbo, with no friends, mother, or other rellies to hold her hand while her nightmarishly dick-headed and sanctimonious husband makes out with a lenser half his age. That's what you get for marrying a lawyer, I guess.What gives me the creeps about this film? It's the emotional pornography. Just as porno publicises acts of privacy, this movie probes into emotionally intimate moments, e.g. when a child asks innocently Are you dying? In a truthful treatment, perhaps it would be tolerable, but in the glitzy context of a money-making vehicle, sorry, that's invasive and unpleasant.Significantly, the film-makers' slip of moral judgement concerns sex, when Julia Roberts's adulterous character spouts off-colour material at her 12 year-old putative step-daughter, and her misjudged words are endorsed and validated in the subsequent action. On the other hand, hypocritically, not the slightest whiff of the frenzied sexual activity that ostensibly drove this adultery appears in the film.I enjoyed the attitude of the 12 year-old daughter (Jena Malone) to her father's tart, and I cheered at every one of her well-aimed taunts, and those at her father as well (Ed Harris). Dad You don't walk out on your mother. Daughter No, that's your job. I never once believed the relationship depicted between the adulterous lawyer and his gormless young marriage-buster, and found his imposition of her on his suffering ex-wife to be spoiled and self-centred, although the movie thoroughly endorsed his behaviour.Of course the whole charade is an elaborate hoax. In the vast majority of such cases, when a father departs with a spring chicken, leaving the menopausal mother in the lurch, he is rarely or never seen again.

Despite its chilly Christmas setting, the film was released in the middle of a very hot summer. I was spending some time in Arizona, and going into an air-conditioned theater to watch this frosty film was like a blast of relief. The movie itself combines dark humor and wild visuals, Burton's very best big budget film.Batman (Michael Keaton) does indeed return, with a pair of villains to face this time -- abandoned child Oswald Cobblepot, aka the Penguin (Danny DeVito) and the less nefarious and more ambiguous Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer). DeVito's Penguin is at the same time less anarchic than Nicholson's Joker from the first film, and more of a threat to Batman because his schemes are more calculated and his political sensibilities more refined. As for the Catwoman, she and Batman strike up a kind of sadistic affair that's paralleled by the hesitant courtship between their alter egos, Bruce Wayne and Selena Kyle.DeVito is an excellent actor and a good choice for the Penguin, but his performance just can't match the kind of charm that Nicholson had in the first film. It's really Pfeiffer's sexy latex-draped Catwoman that makes the film. There's moments of great wit, like when she looks down at her ruined claw with an expression that suddenly takes her back to her secretary days (err... executive assistant). There's also a nice performance by Christopher Walken (with the rather not-so-subtle homage name of Max Shreck) as a greedy crimelord. He gets more time to develop this outside villain than Jack Palance had in the first one, and brings a lot of moments of great humor to the relationship with the Penguin. You almost start to like him by the end, but his score with the Catwoman must be settled.The theme of the film is, once again, duality -- but it works somewhat better than the first film, because the relationship between Catwoman and Batman is more natural and compelling. I also like the one scene with the Penguin and Batman where Penguin accuses Batman of being jealous, you're not a real freak. Really great ideas that are well developed in the interplay between these 3 bizarre personas and their alter-egos.As for Burton's direction, it's much more relaxed and distinctive in this film compared to the first one. A new Gotham set was built for Burton on the west coast (the first one was done in England), and the settings and style are more picturesque, dark, and expansive. You can tell that he had just done Edward Scissorhands and was really feeling his oats when he did this one, at the top of his game trying to top his previous effort. A lot of people, maybe Jack Nicholson fans, might disagree, but I thought that he got the tone and everything just right for this film. It's not too serious but it's also not too goofy; rather than alternating moments of seriousness and camp we get in the first film, this one has a more consistent tone as well.

But while that might be an unfair bias against the film, it is hardly without many flaws of it's own, that hinder it from being a great scary film.The biggest problem within the film, is lack of giving proper amounts of information to make something convincing. When the doctor (played solidly by Tom Atkins) shows signs that he has feelings for Ellie (played by Stacey Nelkin) and sleeps with her, it seems to come out of nowhere. There is no build up to it, nothing to indicate that they would feel that way for each other, as they've only just met over the course of a day. Later, when the doctor frees Ellie from captivity and they race to stop the broadcasts, Ellie is revealed to be one of the robots of the evil Silver Shamrock company. But how long has that been the case? Was she one all along? Why didn't she deactivate, when they blew up the factory, like the other ones did? There are just so many things like this, that it takes you out of the moment and you lose a lot of the tension the film should be generating.That isn't to say the film has nothing good about it. The performances by Tom Atkins and Dan O'Herlihy (as the villain of the piece) are very engaging, especially when they are on-screen together. O'Herlihy brilliantly captures that sense of quiet evil with his performance, as he's all smiles and charm one minute, then the heart of darkness the next. Atkins is great as the reluctant hero, who is clearly in over his head. Also, the musical score is top notch (not surprising, as it comes from John Carpenter). It is very eerie and constantly give you the feeling of dread. Even the jingle to the Silver Shamrock television ad can give you the spooks.Still, despite all that, the film ultimately suffers from some very poor script writing and lack of proper explanations. It takes what could have been one of the all-time classic scare films and turns it into a mediocre effort, that should have been thought-out more.This isn't really a bad movie, but the flaws within it keep it from being truly good. I applaud the makers for trying something different. And while the film should not be snubbed for that, it has plenty of it's own issues that lessen the appeal of it. As loathe as I am of remakes, I actually think this film could benefit from such, provided the script writing was up to par. As it stands, the film is merely watchable.

How many times have you gone swimming and hoped a shark wouldn't come? Or whether somebody's outside your shower curtain? And of course we always hum their respective themes, whether we're going after someone in a pool\/lake or making a stabbing motion with that irritating-but-effective high pitched Psycho theme. Well add silk scarves and icepicks to the list. Detective Nick Curran is investigating a case of an old rocker killed in bed while tied up and repeatedly stabbed. Their trail leads them to his girlfriend Catherine Tramell, a novelist. Interestingly, a character in one of her books is killed in the precise manner as the rocker. So is someone framing her, or does she know that people would think she's nuts for killing someone in the exact way she wrote it obviously naming her the killer? Then Nick starts to get obsessed. The sexually charged presence of Catherine affects him, making him smoke in non-smoking buildings and even having rough sex with his girlfriend. He also has to deal with Catherine's girlfriend(and not in the girl and she's a friend)Roxie, who's quite jealous. So the question becomes is Nick dating the killer he's looking for? Or is Catherine's lover a little too obsessive? The film was extremely controversial when it first came out. Not only for the sex filled narrative but also the treatment of gay and lesbians. Some gays and lesbians aren't crazy? We're not always that idealic view that we have. In a special feature on the Desperate Housewives set, Felicity Huffman recalls the scene where a woman asks isn't it great being a mom? Well yeah if you don't factor in the sleepless nights, frantic running around and calling for babysitters and housework. Same idea here. Sure Roxie is slightly off and a bit obsessive but isn't some of them? Like Norman Bates said, we all go a little mad sometimes. Now the sex in the film is never explicit. We don't see anything that'd get the film NC-17 but it sure implies a lot. We got implied oral on male and female, standard positions, tons of nudity and even some girl-on-girl lesbian kissing(sorry guys, no love scene with those 2). The unrated version just merely extends shots by a few seconds or changes the camera angle, such as Nick and Catherine's first sexual encounter. As for extra features they're not bad, including one feature that shows what was cut out(which really needs to be implemented more in these unrated editions). The commentaries are OK except you might find famed feminist author Camille Paglia a bit irritating since she's so university-lecture and overemphazing things. For example here's something she mentions about the interrogation scene The intensity of looking in this scene, looking on the part of the men, on Catherine's part, on our part, raises the temperature in the scene. There's a kind of sadism as Catherine plays with her prey. There's a kind of evocation of great movies about St. Joan, where in this case, the perverse saint, a Mary Magdalene figure, is defying her interrogators. Um, lady it's just a scene.

This arrogant American mentality puts our soldiers at another distinct disadvantage. In one of the scenes the Ranger commander disagrees with the Delta Forces Non-Commissioned Officer In Charge (NCOIC) and subsequently reprimands him by telling him, you are combat ineffective soldier!, for disobeying his directive in front of his subordinates. This may have been the most realistic depiction in the entire movie. Anyone who's been in the Army knows that Delta Forces soldiers are on an elite level rarely seen in any military setting and should be respected as such.

This is a movie that is about the love of baseball. What I enjoyed most about this story is that it felt like it was timeless, this is a movie that really doesn't age, I thought it was made in the 1990's, surprising to find out that it was made in the 1980's. The characters are so wonderful and charming, how could you not adore them and wish for Kevin Costner to succeed in making this baseball field? The love that was put into this movie shows and was a pleasure to watch.Ray Kinsella is a novice farmer who lives in rural Iowa with his wife, Annie, and their young daughter Karin. While walking through his cornfield, Ray hears a voice whisper, If you build it, he will come, and sees a vision of a baseball field. Believing he is somehow being asked to build it, and fearing he is in danger of turning into his father, Ray strongly wishes to do so. Although skeptical, Annie is supportive. Watched by incredulous neighbors, Ray plows under his corn and builds the field. A year passes without incident. Ray and Annie are eventually forced to consider replacing the field with corn to stay financially solvent. At this point Karin spots a man on the ball field who Ray discovers is Shoeless Joe Jackson, a baseball player idolized by his father. Joe is thrilled to be able to play baseball again and asks to bring others with him to the field. He later returns with the seven other players banned in the 1919 Black Sox scandal, emerging from the corn by the outfield. With the help of others Ray sticks to his faith and believes that this field means something and do whatever he can to find out what this will do for his life.I'm really glad I gave Field of Dreams a chance, it's a delightful film. We have some powerhouse performances from Costner, Liotta and Jones. I'm surprised I didn't see this movie earlier, but better late than never. I think also visually this is one of the most memorable films in is simplicity, Ray Liotta and his teammates coming out of the field and going back in was so memorizing.

Leonard, played by Guy Pearce, is a man who has no short-term memory after being attacked when trying to save his wife from a rape-murder. The rest of his life is spent in a quest for revenge - a revenge he can't remember if he's ever been able to achieve because he has no short-term memory. That's an interesting enough premise, the added piece here being the decision to offer us the story in reverse chronology - beginning with Leonard killing the man he believes to be his wife's killer (played by Joe Pantoliano) and then scene by scene retracing the story, going back just a bit at a time to fill in the details of his search, and how he came to the conclusion that Teddy was responsible. Essentially, then, the viewer is pulled into Leonard's own condition - seeing what's happening with no clue as to how it came about because we haven't seen what came before. Edited into the regression scenes are black and white scenes in which Leonard, holed up in his hotel room, essentially talks about his condition and seems to fill in some essential details about his past.It's an interesting way to present a whodunit - because the question all the way through is whether Teddy is actually the killer. The ending offers up a twist - although it isn't the biggest surprise you'll ever see, if only because the way the movie is put together you're conditioned from the beginning to expect pretty much any twist possible, it still leaves open a decent bit of uncertainty about who actually killed Lenny's wife. So, the premise and construction of the story is interesting enough. Also interesting, though, is that - while it's intriguing - I just didn't find it particularly enjoyable to watch. Perhaps it's because I didn't buy Leonard's condition - for one reason. He used photographs to jog his memory, so he took pictures of important people, places, etc,. to refer to when necessary. What's wrong with that? Well - nothing, I suppose, except that I found it passing strange that, for a guy who supposedly forgets everything within a couple of minutes of it happening, he always knew exactly which pocket to find the pictures in. He NEVER had to search for one of his photographs; there was never even a moment of hesitation when he had to refer to one. That's a small point, perhaps, but it caused a bit of a credibility gap for me. The movie's well acted by the leads and interesting enough as the pieces of the puzzle are sorted out, but for me it fizzled a bit on that admittedly relatively small point. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 September 2009","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" It's certainly a unique concept.

That's an interesting enough premise, the added piece here being the decision to offer us the story in reverse chronology - beginning with Leonard killing the man he believes to be his wife's killer (played by Joe Pantoliano) and then scene by scene retracing the story, going back just a bit at a time to fill in the details of his search, and how he came to the conclusion that Teddy was responsible. Essentially, then, the viewer is pulled into Leonard's own condition - seeing what's happening with no clue as to how it came about because we haven't seen what came before. Edited into the regression scenes are black and white scenes in which Leonard, holed up in his hotel room, essentially talks about his condition and seems to fill in some essential details about his past.It's an interesting way to present a whodunit - because the question all the way through is whether Teddy is actually the killer. The ending offers up a twist - although it isn't the biggest surprise you'll ever see, if only because the way the movie is put together you're conditioned from the beginning to expect pretty much any twist possible, it still leaves open a decent bit of uncertainty about who actually killed Lenny's wife. So, the premise and construction of the story is interesting enough. Also interesting, though, is that - while it's intriguing - I just didn't find it particularly enjoyable to watch. Perhaps it's because I didn't buy Leonard's condition - for one reason. He used photographs to jog his memory, so he took pictures of important people, places, etc,. to refer to when necessary. What's wrong with that? Well - nothing, I suppose, except that I found it passing strange that, for a guy who supposedly forgets everything within a couple of minutes of it happening, he always knew exactly which pocket to find the pictures in. He NEVER had to search for one of his photographs; there was never even a moment of hesitation when he had to refer to one. That's a small point, perhaps, but it caused a bit of a credibility gap for me.

You know these filmmakers are going to hell for this, right?STAR TREK GENERATIONS was meant to showcase the TREK TV spin off, THE NEXT GENERATION; instead, the singular event on all our minds is how Kirk is going to eat it. The legacy itself defeats the movie. But if it were not for the legacy, Kirk's downfall would be even less of an anticlimax than it already is. Captain James T. Kirk is but a minor tangential character in this mix of annoying and innocuous characters. Meanwhile, there's a bad movie going on...Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) of the 24th Century and Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner) of the 23rd Century join forces to battle a scientist named Soren (Malcolm McDowell), who is destroying stars and planets to catch an energy ribbon called The Nexus, buzzing through the universe and destroying everything in its path, while transporting the people it kills to their personal fantasy realms - you know, like the Catholic version of Heaven. Movie opens with Chekov (Walter Koenig), Scotty (James Doohan) and Kirk attending the maiden launch of Enterprise-B. Crowded by paparazzi on the bridge, in a strange mix of art-imitating-life, they meet unseasoned Captain Harriman (Alan Ruck - Cameron from FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF; hope he doesn't do to the Enterprise what he did to his dad's Ferrari...).Almost immediately, Enterprise-B must rescue two ships caught in splashy special effects - The Nexus. After beaming refugees aboard, Harriman has no idea how to outrun the Nexus (which is why he left all the planning to Ferris) and abdicates command to Kirk, who plants his ever-widening girth in the Captain's seat with a dopey grin on his face, before he begrudgingly gives it back to Harriman and reverts to his Action Hero idiom to save the day. Exactly like Spock's death in STAR TREK II, Kirk is killed by a McGuffin he runs downstairs to Do Something Jargony To Some Jargony Thingy - and is blown into space...78 Years Later...We meet the crew of THE NEXT GENERATION (TNG) in a tiresome sailing ship sequence that only TNG fans' mothers could love. Then Captain Picard leads Riker (smug Jonathan Frakes), Data (silvery Brent Spiner), Geordi (visored LeVar Burton), Crusher (insipid Gates McFadden) and other passengers, on a rescue mission to a dead space station, where they pick up a scientist named Soren, who immediately causes trouble with his devious Nexus plans and British accent. Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg) appears with a funny hat any time Picard needs information about the Nexus. She explains that if you fall into it, you're not going to care about anything and not going to want to come back. But it's the old SUPERMAN II argument You'll lose your powers forever - until he wants them back, at which point, he goes and gets them. So too, when Picard finds himself in the Nexus as the father of five kids from a Charles Dickens novel, he retains all his faculties and decides to leave.Guinan actually appears in the Nexus with Picard, driving the movie further into B-Movie dipping sauce with each idiotic line, I am onboard the Enterprise, but I'm also here... Think of me as an echo of the person you know. Then she tells Picard he can simply leave... to any point in time he chooses! So when ships are caught in the Nexus and destroyed, we know for a fact they ARE going to be all right - so what's all the fuss? It isn't Real, says Kirk later. But what IS real after Death? Would a robe and wings do it for you?Meanwhile, unimportant subplots seem to be happening in another movie Data (TNG's emotionless Vulcan analog) implants an emotion chip and becomes almost as annoying as Jar Jar Binks; ugly Klingon bitches with large ta-tas ally with Soren, kidnap Geordi and blow up Picard's Enterprise, which crash-lands with all the NEXT GEN overactors. 78 years later, and still not a seatbelt in sight.The crashed Enterprise is sucked into the Nexus, portrayed as a horrible, explosive death - but Funny Hat Exposition Lady just said it was Paradise... If you have the power to go anywhere in time, Jean-Luc, go back to when you first picked up Soren - and don't. Why go back to the moment of desperation as seconds tick away, trying to stop Soren firing a missile into the heart of a star? If you can pick up Kirk to help you, why not pick up your whole crew? Picard leaves his Dickens Thanksgiving and meets the Priceline Negotiator in the Nexus, convincing him to help stop Soren; whereupon Kirk and Picard stop Soren through the technological method of fisticuffs.

Also starring Heroes' Stephen Tobolowsky as Mitch Myerson, Tara Karsian as Mannish Applicant, Christiana Capetillo as Exotic Applicant, Jessica Lundy as Talkative Applicant and Renée Estevez as Perfect Applicant. Fonda is very good as the unknowing nice apartment owner, Leigh of course almost steal the show as the lodger from hell, it is very gripping story based on a novel, a great thriller. Very good!

It is a very dark comedy that wouldn't be funny at all if it weren't for little moments and certain characters. Much of the humor, as seen by the writers, is geared towards older teen-agers but there are moments that are very much for the adults; like the cynical teachers smoking in the meeting room and the sinister minister at the various funerals, Heather No. 3 dabbing her forehead from water at the holy fount in the church, and the quarterback's father who says I love my dead gay son. I remember when this film was released in 1989 and it caused a sensation with the industry cognoscenti in West Hollywood and became an instant cult movie. Whether it is now a classic cult film is questionable. Certainly Winona Ryder and Christian Slater went on to great careers and it's good to see them here so young and fresh and, especially in Slater's case, uninhibited in his acting and very impressive as such.Shannen Doherty, as Heather No. 2, was very new on the scene as well and she is probably the funniest of the leads, coming into her own after Heather No. 1 is murdered and Doherty takes over the mantel of the most popular girl at Westerberg High School.The parents are all portrayed as near idiots which fits the view of most 16 year olds. Every clichéd group of students is on display here. The Heathers and Veronica, the beautiful girls who rule the roost, the nerds (who are very funny), the dumpy and dull girls and the jocks.The film takes aim at all of these entities and sets out to destroy the popular students and the jocks. Christian Slater, the outsider, has come to town and like Jehovah sets off on a killing spree of Biblical proportions, using the disgruntled Veronica (Ryder) to innocently, at first, help him.The movie basically is mocking the over-emotionalism of young people, the phony hypocrisy of the teachers and the comatose indifference of parents. It hits bull's eyes in all three of these intentions. But the whole leaves a bitter taste in the mouth, even with the strangely happy and surreal ending with the change of order coming about as Veronica takes over the mantel of most popular girl and befriends the overweight and friendless Martha, a nice bit of understated comedy played by Carrie Lynn who doesn't speak a single line until the very end, when she gets the last words in the movie.'Heathers' not as clever as it once seemed and I can't rate it all that high as comedy, and as satire it really is too dark and disturbing to be really funny. It has a bitterness and cynicism that was rather a new thing in teen films at the time, and has spawned a number of copycat movies and TV shows.But the movie has a strange impact, like a spiked date-rape drink, followed by a corn nut chaser to blow all the poison out of the system. And it certainly lingers in the memory, especially the opening and closing versions of the song 'Che sera sera'.It's a good solid entertainment for younger adults and older teens but it's not one of the great dark comedies or cult classics that the promoters told us it was when it was released.

It will gnaw at your mind and make you look at life and people in a very different way, which you never did before. The Boys Next Door is just such a film for me.Director Penelope Spheeris is probably most well-known for her work on perennial comedic fare, such as Wayne's World and Black Sheep, but long before that she was a very edgy and somewhat visionary filmmaker. Some of her earliest works have a very deep social commentary to them, of which this film is one of her best (and most overlooked). This tale of two high school outcasts, who go to the big city and raise some murderous hell, almost has a modern ring to it. In the wake of real life events, like the massacres at Columbine and Virgina Tech, this film seems less the low-rent crime drama it probably was seen as when it first debuted and more like a prophecy of things to come.It is absolutely chilling in how it shows the casual use of violence by two supposed teenagers. Their lack of conscience and concern for anything or anyone, save themselves, feels like a mirror being held up to our so-called modern world. What really stuck out for me, though, was the moments of seemingly uncontainable rage expressed by the character of Roy (incredibly performed by Maxwell Caulfield). One scene that truly made my blood run cold, was after his first act of violence on a gas-station attendant, when he and his friend Bo (played by a very young Charlie Sheen, in one of his earliest leading roles) are talking about it in their hotel room, and Roy expresses that the beating wasn't good enough. That he should have killed him. The look of satisfaction on his face as he expresses these thoughts, brought out a dark symmetry to the character, which would dominate everything he does afterwards. It actually comes off like a blueprint to the mindset of such thrill-killers that we see in our real world today. I really enjoyed how the film almost plays like a docudrama in some instances, like this one.While some of the language and settings might be a bit dated, the emotion and societal insights into the mind of teenage rage are as powerful now as they ever were back in 1985 (when the film debuted). At the time, this film had a bit of controversy about it, due to the amounts of violence shown on screen, but I think that today, in our much more politically-correct minded world-view, it is the thoughts behind the violence which should be more disturbing. It is a film that has truly become MORE relevant as time has gone by, not less. If there is anything lacking in the film, it would be not enough information given on the characters life at home. We see the torment they have with not fitting in with their peers at school, as well as their fears of living out the rest of their lives at dead-end jobs, but there is little info on the role played by the family in helping these boys to be filled with such murderous contempt. There is one scene with Roy's father being shown as a neglectful parent, more interested in getting his next beer than the welfare of his son, but I felt this brief glimpse should have been expand on more. Still, even lacking in this one area, the film is still a very potent brew to behold.Make no mistake, this is not a feel good or party film. It is a shocking, and sometimes twisted, look into how society can mold a teenager into a raging killer and how easily that rage can be let loose on an unprepared society. And the fact these two characters are attractive looking, as well, only deepens the scary similarities of our current times. Despite that, however, it is certainly a very worthwhile film and is deserving of much more attention. If you are looking for a film that isn't just out to entertain you, but also make you think, this is one movie you need to seek out! But be warned... prepare to be unnerved by much of what you will see. I doubt many will walk away from this film totally unaffected, nor should they.
