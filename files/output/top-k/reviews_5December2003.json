Where Mel Gibson's character would basically go from thuhg to criminal to thug to try and get his 70 grand, Paul Bettany's character devoloped an obssession over a crime boss, so much so, that he wanted to be a better version of him. Nevertheless, both characters go about their business without much care for anything else, the consequences, or what he will ultimatley accomplish. Again, Payback had the more comical angle while Gangster No.1 had the more depressingly pathetic approach. On to the story now.  We first see the older and successful of Paul Bettany's character who hears about a former collegue getting out of prison. Then a good portion of the film is given to him reminscing about his formoer colleugue as well his rise to power.  One thing that is blatantly clear is that he has an intense obssession over Freddie Mays who is the leading crime boss in london.  As he said he love Freddies, suit, shoes, tie, demeanor, and even his cuff links.  We also see that Paul Bettany's character, who has no name and is credited as young gangster, clearly has no sense of conscience or morality.  When he find out that Freddie Mays was going to be jumped, e killed the only other guy who knew and then watched as Freddie got beaten and his wife's throat get slit. POSSIBLE SPOILER Ironically enough, even though he did backstab Freddie Mays, when all is said and done, it appears that the only way he can justify hi9mself and what he has done is threw Freddie Mays who now hates the young (or old) Gangster. in the final act of the film, we see the gangster desperatly trying to impress Freddie Mays who really wants nothing to do with him.  The gangster gets so desperate to be acknowledged that he actually tries to get Freddie to kill him kinda like all attention is good attention.  HOwever, Freddie Mays hates the gangster so much that he isnt even worth killing.  The ending speech is very similer to Denzel Washington's in Training Day, heck, they both refer to King Kong, however, the huge difference is, in Training Day, Denzel Washington lost everything but is still trying to show that he should be feared whereas, in Gangster No.1, the gangster actually has everything, money, the crime syundicate, yet he is still unhappy and tries to justify his existence by contantly reminding himself that he is number 1.  It might not be an all too original ending but it fit so well and its hard to imagine how else it could have ended.sidenote there is one particuilar scene that is both an unfliching look at murder and quite possibly a technical achievment.

The way the viewer interpreters Santa speaks wonders for there Christmas sprit and the general happiness in life. This movie is also likely to change the viewers mind about what or who Santa is.The first set of scenes were designed for the viewer to see who the main character Kris is and what he stood for and  to  provide proof to the conclusion that the viewer has drawn. The first scene in this movie has Kris Kringle walking down the streets of New York with a smile on looking into various shops to see the window displays that are being changed to Christmas themes. Kris stops at one window and instructs the man setting up the display that he is doing in incorrectly and is very polite about it. The director seems to this to show the viewer that this man will be playing Santa in the movie. The next scene Kris is walking and sees a drunken Santa trying to use a whip Kris offers his help and finds that the Santa is drunk so he tells the director of the parade and tells her she offers him the job and he agrees. The writer wrote this scene seemingly to provide more proof that Kris is Santa. After Kris's excellent performance as Santa he is offered a job as the Santa at Macy's he agrees and brings his own costume to the job (it is much nicer then the one that the company has provided). This was done again by the writer to build evidence that he is the real deal. After a few days at his job Kris has to go through psychological testing because he has mentioned that he is the real Santa he complies and says that he has taken dozens and hasn't failed one yet. This sequence of events demonstrates to the viewer that he has been questioned and doubted about is identify before and has never been proven wrong.The next set of events show the different types of people whom are split up into two groups the first those who believe in Santa and the second those who do not. This set of scenes starts with the results of Kris's test the man who administered the test claims that Kris is delusional and likely to hurt someone but a man who has tested him before (whom Kris's employer has called in) disagrees strongly saying something to the effect of though this man is delusional his is a delusion to do go and wouldn't hurt a fly (at this point Kris's employer is a non believer). In this scene the believers and nonbelievers argue about Kris's ability to do his job. Scenes continue like this for a while climaxing and towards the end of the movie when Kris is legally declared the real Santa thanks to his friends and his employer who has now has become a believer and gives Kris hope.This is a great Christmas movie for people of all ages it has drama an intelligent plot that is but to the children's story of Santa.

There is no real reason for it - in the telling of a story - but the image and the music somehow work magic.)  The soldiers mission is simple to comprehend Let us try and complete our mission and then get out of here alive; but there is a real sense of the honour and bravery that has to make up a modern army.

Instead they will cringe at badly done accents and wonder where the boy's likability  went. No loved one is spared, and the writers seemed to go out of their way to transform Lane's Justins from leather to clay. Why does the media tear down our heroes?Luke Perry's affected accent borders on parody and Cynthia Geary, (formerly Shelly on Northern Exposure), is downright unappealing as Lane's wife, Kellie. All too often TV actors lack a certain texture to make it on the big screen, and the casting here proves it. I suspect the powers that be were trying to cash in on the popularity of Perry's and Geary's television shows. The late Red Mitchell, a genuine Texan, and film actor, was excellent as the poetry spouting  Cody Lambert. Cowboy poetry is a real art form, but the real Cody Lambert wasn't known for his poetical abilities.Further evidence that Perry is no Lane Frost comes from the scene where he tosses his hat, brim down, on a chair. No self respecting cowboy would ever do that! (In fact, it was a rapid glance test for sniffing out coca-cola cowboys back in the days following Urban Cowboy when everyone and their brother was trying to pass as a real cowboy. On that subject, a lot of rodeo cowboys are treated with disdain by those from working ranches. Rodeo is an extremely expensive hobby and most real cowboys can't afford to ride any circuit other than the pasture fence line.) The vast majority of rodeo cowboys, and wage riding cowboys, for that matter, end up so stoved up that they are old men by the age of 40, something the film gave a passing nod to. Lane really did wear a wild turkey feather in his hatband, but he wasn't hurt by Red Rock, who was actually a popular bull to draw. The trailer in the picture was an insult to the man, and they did split up for awhile, but it wasn't over cheating. Tuff really did manage to hang on for 8 more seconds in honor of Lane during his ride at the 1989 National Rodeo Finals. You can say well, heck, it is only a movie, cut it some slack, but I say this is about a real man who really touched a lot of people's hearts, and those that don't know any better now only get this fractured view of him. He deserved a lot better.Then there is the way family members are portrayed. If one believes this movie, the whole Frost family had closeness issues... and that is just with the parents. Lane's siblings are ignored all together. In real life, Elsie is generous and the picture of Christian charity, and bless her for it, but this film showed her and Clyde in a pretty bad light, and doesn't say much for his real life wife either.Still, there are some interesting moments, and an absolutely priceless credit sequence where we get to see the real Lane Frost in action. Your heart can leap into your mouth watching him get busted up by those bulls and you may cheer when he gets up and walks away with that infectious grin of his. If you want to be a bullrider, you may even give it a rethink after seeing that even a champion gets stomped every once in awhile.I always bust out sobbing while those precious minutes roll by, but it is from seeing Lane ride again, and being mentally transported back in time. Those were exciting and very stressful years, and I frankly resent the director's attempt to force us into reaching for the tissues by the choice in music over the credits. (Typical country tearjerkers.) Instead of walking away in contemplation, or in marvel of Lane's life, we are left on a very big downer, a box office killer and further proof someone was asleep on the job.

Isn't that the most inspired horror idea you've ever heard ?  Pardon my sarcasm...I shouldn't be too harsh when reviewing a Friday the 13th sequel. Obviously because this entire series never intended to win any important awards. Friday the 13th is a money-making franchise and, as long as the story contains a few nasty and inventive killings, the audience is happy. So why should I be any different. I enjoyed ALL Fridays up till a certain level and I even think this third installment is a huge improvement over the second one. I might even say it slightly surpasses the original.Part 3 was directed by the same person who brought us episode 2. Steve Miner obviously learnt a few techniques in the time between his two efforts. I watched Friday the 13th part 2 only a couple of weeks ago and I already don't remember anything about it. I just know it was slow and boring with no killings worth remembering. And that's in fact the only thing that counts when making a slasher !! Memorable killings ! In that point of view, Friday the 13th part 3 is far more superior. Jason becomes a bit more creative when he's wasting the lives of his young victims and ... even more importantly... he develops his personality and own style that he'll continue to use for the rest of career. In this movie, he becomes the slow moving brute with the typical hockey-mask. Let's just say he got that mask as a gift from one of his preys. Furthermore, there's not much more to tell. Except for a few weird details. Crazy Ralph from the first two movies is being replaced by an even bigger weirdo, although his appearance is rather short. It also seems like Jason once left a survivor behind ( this sequence is explained through a flashback )...that was hard  to believe for me. And - last but not least -  even though this movie was shot in the early 80's, one of the leading characters is an authentic hippie !! Friday the 13th part 3 ranks pretty high when all the separate episodes are compared with each other, in my opinion. Plus, I think it's a pretty important movie for the series. Along with episode 6 ( which remains my personal favorite ) this movie was responsible for making Jason Vorhees the immense horror icon that he is. A must for the fans.

Picture quality is more than adequate and the characters are very well developed. The first prize has to go to the boy Isaiah himself who really was cute, no other word to describe him. The story is well executed and of course does not fail to raise emotion. What I query in the film is its political correctness. Any normal person would expect the boy to remain with his adoptive mother, as his biological mother had left him for, and even considered him, to be dead. That his biological mother, on finding out he's alive, tries to reclaim him seems normal. What is not normal, however, is that the courts give any creedence to the idea that he should be given back to her, as it is implied, on the sole grounds that he has the same colour skin as her !!! The rubbish spoken by her lawyer to the effect that black babies should be with black mothers should have been shown to be the rubbish it is, but it seems to come across as being the only argument that influenced the court's decision as, no other factor seems to have warranted the baby being returned to its biological mother. I am sure that if the roles and been reversed and that it was a white baby abandoned in a trash can adopted by a black family, the courts would have left it with its adoptive family on the basis that skin colour had no importance, only the love of a stable family. This last hypothesis is, in my opinion, the just one, but it should be applied in all cases, whatever the colour of the baby and whatever the colour of the family. One get's the impression the director wants to be good to the blacks at all costs even when the well-being of the child in this case would dictate otherwise and I call this being a victim of political correctness. Of course, the ending is diluted and we see Khaila calling back Jessica Lange to look after the child when she realises that she can't cope. Her behaviour throughout the film is quite plausible and quite understandeable. What is not, it the behaviour of her attorney and the courts. I am not an American but one of the great things about that country is the mixture of origins which has gone to forge it - people of all colours and races but all American. Once you go down the line of wanting to make a black child have a black doll, read obligatorily books about black characters, have black parents etc etc, you are starting down the same path as the Ku Klux Klan many years ago and it's not better but more of the same.

The remnants of Kubrick's message, namely that humans are soon-to-be obsolete beasts, contend with the usual Spielberg formula of corn syrup, tears, and awe, so that the result is unsettling and more than a bit curiouser and curiouser.First of all, be aware that, despite the fact that there is a full serving of the Spielberg recipe here (cute kids, dazzling special effects, a beautiful score by John Williams, social consciousness seen largely from a kid's POV, etc.), this is not a feel good movie that will appeal to the mass audience at which Spielberg usually aims. The heartland of America will find this film disturbing and will tell their neighbors to stay away. Sci fi afficionados of the hard science variety (like myself) will have mixed feelings since some of the science is, shall we say, unlikely. The fantasy\/sorcery crowd will probably be disenchanted for other reasons, although there is a glorious ending that might mist up one's eyes (it did mine). Overall, however, this is an unsettling look at humanity and where we're headin' (Is that Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?), and the treatment is definitely NOT something for the kiddies. It's liable to give them nightmares.The central hook of the film is that we are made to identify with the robotic mechas, especially Haley Joel Osment's David and Jack Angel's Teddy and Jude Law's Gigolo Joe, while being reminded that they are not human, or more properly, that they are more admirable than human. In a way the robots resemble the have-nots of the current society, the handicapped and the poor, while the humans in the persons of Monica Swinton (Frances O'Connor), her son Martin (Jake Thomas) and the Flesh Fair entrepreneur (Brendan Gleeson) represent respectively the privileged, the cruel, and the exploitive. Monica's compromised morality is made clear in the scene in the woods (which I won't describe for fear of giving away too much). One also gets the sense that she and her husband (who portray the usual kid-show parental mentality) are not actually bright enough to figure out what has happened when siblings and friends have conflicts. Monica simply sides with her biological child and throws David to the wolves, as it were.On another level this is a movie about a child's undying love for his mother, a love that lasts for two thousand years and a day and is never compromised. It is about believing in fairy tales and the miraculous, a modern day Pinocchio in Wonderland as might be dreamed up by admirers of Blade Runner (1982). In the Spielberg canon, echoes from his cinematic predecessors mesh with echoes from his own movies in a sometimes all too obvious way. Note the return of the moon (in sinister splendor) from E.T. with Teddy (who could have been retrieved from the set of Blade Runner--as could Prof. Hobby, AKA Geppetto) trudging across the top of a rise in front of it.The sets and the animations are sumptuous and beautiful. The robots and the aliens are ingeniously crafted. I very much liked the vision of a drowned Manhattan with the upper stories of the skyscrapers rising above the level of the sea (presumably from global warming), giving us a very quiet and almost contemplative Manhattan, and then the skyscrapers immersed in ice as the earth falls into a prolonged ice age. The sense of the rapid passage of awesome time reminded me a bit of Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey (1968), while Dr. Know (voice of Robin Williams) recalled The Wizard of Oz (1939), and the Blue Fairy (voice of Meryl Streep) something from Disney.This is a substantially compromised masterpiece, as it certainly had to be coming from the ghost of Kubrick as fashioned by Hollywood's most powerful and most commercially successful director, but an engaging, ambitious spiral into the future, one well worth watching one, one that will linger in the mind awhile.See this to encourage Spielberg to emphasize creativity over formula, to encourage him to make more movies that dare to offend the mass mind while intriguing the rest of us.

There was a tasteful suggestion of a sex scene. The goriness was in line with expectations, not overstated.Unlike other reviewers, I found the action straightforward enough.SPOILERSThe new Puppet Master, Dr. Magrew (George Peck) is experimenting to discover the methods the original Puppet Master, Andre Toulon, used to create semi-living puppets.  Assistants, who first carve the 444 wooden pieces that go into a puppet, can be transformed by a lightening-like effect into the inner workings of a puppet.

Road Warrior (Or Mad Max 2 in some countries) is the continuation of Max Rockatansky's life in what seems to be a post-apocalyptic future. After losing his family to a vicious gang of bikers in the first movie, Max tries to survive in the bleak and lifeless Australian post-nuclear outback. He has become a loner, a sad man with no care for the future and who lives for the moment. Although Mel Gibson's performance is very believable, he hardly talks. There's plenty of action car chases, people being hacked and maimed and ran over by merciless mack trucks, but there's also a good story. Max sort of befriends a colony of civilized people, trying to survive the insane punk-biker gangs that want to steal their fuel. It's funny to see that fuel becomes more important than water, considering all events take place in extremely arid areas. The film editing is top notch, all was done with care. Brian May's music score is thunderous (No, he's not the guy from Queen!) and the action scenes are gut wrenching and believable. I guess that's very important when you're watching a Sci-Fi film; that you actually believe everything you see. It's a tough call deciding whether this one is better than the first Mad Max, but I'd have to admit that Road Warrior moves at a frenetic pace and, despite being an almost 23 year old movie, it still holds up extremely well. Repeated viewing will only enhance the charm of this truly influential Science Fiction Masterpiece. 10 out of 10!!!

It has all the marks of an artsy-fartsy independent film--the handheld camera moves, the jumps in time, the improvised scenes--but it works. The fact it works is largely the result of the excellent leading performances by Marissa Tomei and Vincent D'Onofrio. Tomei makes her character (who's a bit of a doormat and whiner) into a likable, realistic person. If there's a better actor at playing characters who can't quite fit in their own skins than D'Onofrio, I haven't seen him. He's splendid in this film, and very funny and touching by turns. He's particularly good in the scene where his character dazzles a classroom of children with his language skills.The writer\/director\/editor Brad Anderson seems to be a bit self-conscious in his work (some scenes shout Look at me! I'm a quirky independent movie! I'm art!), and some of the film is frustrating. Is Sam Deeds, D'Onofrio's character, really a time traveller? Is he insane? Does it matter? Anderson never really seems to care about this. Then again, this ambiguity is one of the film's strengths. Perhaps the point of HAPPY ACCIDENTS is that love is what matters, rather than time, space, or mental health.It's far from a perfect film, but I'm happy I gave it 2 hours of my life, and I'll probably give it more time in the future.Wardicus ","genre":null},{"date":"5 December 2003","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Alright, HAPPY ACCIDENTS is a weird, pretentious movie.
