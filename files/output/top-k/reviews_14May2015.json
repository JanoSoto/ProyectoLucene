[{"date":"14 May 2015","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" *SPOILER ALERT* If They could put in The Jump program, karate, martial arts, etc programs into a person, why not just put in a superman program! Like the jump program was Impossible, the Superman Program Would be impossible too! If you're connected to the matrix for a long time and if you have to go pee... You pee in the matrix but where does that pee go in real life as they only connect the brain while they put you in the matrix. These put The Matrix as a 5\/10 star review from me. Another thing I do not understand is how people don't get the movie! The movie is very very easy to understand. Be-Lieve Me!If You get this movie for free, I think, I think it is your money's worth but certainly not your time's worth. Thank You. But this is my individual opinion and if you are against me, I don't give a Damn!
