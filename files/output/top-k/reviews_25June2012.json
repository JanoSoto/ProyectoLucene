Still, this classic film noir is pretty enjoyable in its own right even if the book's complex plot makes following things a touch tricky at times. But what really elevates this film, and what the studio knew at the time given their prominence in the publicity, is the electric chemistry between screen idols Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. It is a joy to watch and lifts what might have been a fairly plodding crime caper into the stuff of legend.Bogart is perfect as Philip Marlowe, a world-weary private detective summoned to the mansion of the aging General Sternwood (Charles Waldron) who asks Marlows for help when he finds himself being blackmailed. The General is convinced that it has something to do with one of his flighty daughters - the good-time-girl Carmen (Martha Vickers) or the femme fatale Vivian (Bacall). But as Marlowe digs a little deeper, it soon appears that everyone has something to hide. Marlowe's investigations turn over some unpleasant stones and as the case gets ever more complex, Marlowe can't help but feel that Vivian is the key...It may be suffering from some excessively dark scenes due to a lack of colourisation but The Big Sleep remains the classic film noir. Bogart simply IS Marlowe, wonderfully ragged at the edges and wears the expression of someone who has seen the worst the world has to offer. As a viewer with little exposure to Bogart's work (most of my movies involve at least one explosion), I had always assumed him to be a somewhat limited actor - but he is unmissable, especially when he and Bacall exchange dialogue that crackles with sexual tension and innuendo. The film is probably the closest to Raymond Chandler's vision and does the story justice, although I personally felt that some characters were underwritten and some dialogue felt difficult to understand. Maybe some of the technical advancements that have been made over the last seventy years could help iron out these particular issues but they rarely impede on the film as a whole and I can't score a movie lower just because it's old.But then again, that's part of its charm - there's no CG or big fight scenes to wow the audience but it doesn't need them. If anything, it feels more authentic than a modern version might. I still believe that instead of endless sequels or half-baked ideas like Battleship, something like this could work as a remake - the era has been captured before in the likes of LA Confidential and Road To Perdition so why wouldn't it work? It's difficult to think how the magic between Bogie and Bacall could be replicated but that's why this movie is very much recommended - some things just can't be replicated.

The situation is becoming more and more common. A teenager, a junior in his high school, discovers little by little he is attracted to men. He has a girl friend who would like the relation to go all the way, but he does not bring it there which makes him start wondering.Then he is thrown into the gay world by accident, the way most things happen in life. His first man is a sweet and maybe slightly weak predator, a senior in his high school, and a colleague at his summer workplace. The young junior falls and the senior goes to college in September. Eric will have to live alone with his recollection, his desire and the demand from his mother and society to have a normal life with a girl friend and all the rest that goes along with it. Maggie will play what she still does not know is a game.Then all that happens is accidental till it becomes a real choice. Later he will run away from a straight party when he is called a queer because he dances in a rather exuberant way. He goes to a gay night club or bar where he meets someone. The next stage later on will be to run after his first male lover and to get it finished physically and emotionally right through to the end of the physical act and to the final closure of the emotional experience.Then he will try to go back to a normal straight life and have a night with his girl friend, Maggie. But in the morning he will feel no satisfaction, no fulfillment. He will know then lying is no solution and he will move towards telling his mother and then going back to where he finds his full both physical and emotional nourishment.The film is then interesting because it describes the slow change that occurs in Eric with total sympathy and even empathy. Eric is living what practically all human beings have lived or deserve living the slow awakening of desire and search for satisfaction of that desire, the desire to be appealing to someone else, the desire to answer to the ones who are appealing to him, the desire to feel happy and satisfied when he meets with that mutual appeal which is first of all a strong emotion that becomes a passion. Then the physical act is like natural.This is not typical of gay men, but any man feels that transformation no matter who is the object of the nascent passion. I guess it is also the same thing for women though the film does not insist on the case of the Lesbian friend of Eric's and only shows the deception and frustration of Maggie when she realizes her appeal has been hijacked by Eric.This film insists on the role of the mother that moves from open hostility to acceptance without the know-how required by such a disquieting situation. If the mother accepts her son's choice, she will have to defend him and it when confronted to the dubitative hostility of other parents, not to speak of the open hostility of other teenagers, some school officials, PTA members, church representatives, etc.A good film on the problem and necessity to come out as soon as the appeal starts moving in you, though you need a confident, an accomplice, someone who understands and supports you in that transformation.

Eastman is given the chance to show off his killing skills when his best friend and war buddy Michael Jefferson, Steve James, is brutally attacked and left paralyzed for life by this gang of lowlifes the Ghetto Ghouls whom Jefferson save Eastman from being worked over,after catching them stealing, at the beer storage plant where the two worked at.Tracking the ghouls down to their ghetto clubhouse Eastman exacts revenge on them by blasting one of the gang members away and tying the other one down in the garbage strewn basement where the rats ended up feasting on him. You would think that by then in avenging his friend Michael Jefferson being paralyzed Eastmen would have gone back to his job and back with his life. Instead the guy goes completely loco taking on all the criminals in the city single handedly without even the help of the NYPD. Among Eastman's victims is mob boss Gino Pontivini, Dick Bocceili, who was shaking down the workers at the food plant or wear-house that he and Jefferson worked at. Despite dropping a tied up and helpless Gino after he tried to double cross Eastman, in not telling him that his pet Doberman pincher is guarding his home in Jersey, into a heavy duty meat grinder we later see Gino in the hospital alive and totally intact looking like Boris Karloff did in the film The Mummy.Later trying to be Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver Eastman tried to save a hooker Candy, Cindy Wilkes,from her life of sin on the streets by taking on her pimp Tony Di Beneditto who also doubles as a dealer in the under-aged male sex or chicken trade. Knocking Di Beneditto out and trying the pimp up Eastman douse him with lighter fluid and sets him on fire. Eastman later blast one of the pimp's customers a New Jersey state Senator, David Lipman, away with a mercury tipped bullet hitting him where it hurts the most in order to do the utmost damage.

He completely lost the cleverness and vulgar hilarity of his best films like Spaceballs and Young Frankenstein and replaced that humor with utter silliness and cheap slapstick gags which have been done to death. The kind of comedy he employs in his later films wasn't funny before the films and it certainly wasn't funny for his films. Dracula Dead and Loving It was Brooks' final film for which he sat in the directors chair for, and it is one of his worst. It's a spoof on Bram Stoker's ever popular Dracula story with Leslie Nielsen playing the Count. It's got the same idea as Spaceballs or Young Frankenstein but none of the same intelligence or wit. It's an unfunny sham and I honestly think Mel Brooks should be ashamed of himself for it. And who knows, maybe he was ashamed and that's why Dracula Dead and Loving It is his last film.This is a flick that feels more like someone trying desperately to be as funny as Mel Brooks rather than Mel Brooks himself. It has remnants of all the same gags we've seen in Brooks' more classic films, but it ruins them with one silly gag after another. Obviously it's supposed to be silly, stupid, and over-the-top, but it's also supposed to be funny... and it's not. I laughed once or twice during the ninety minutes of stupidity this film has to offer, and those laughs mostly came from places where I could see the old Mel Brooks.I'm not talking about physically seeing Mel Brooks because you do see him in the film as he plays Dr. Van Helsing. Sadly, even his performance is dreadful. The only decent performance of the film would have to be Leslie Nielsen's portrayal of Count Dracula, as he certainly tries his best to make the most out of an awful script. I don't know if I could have asked for a better actor to play the Count in a spoof version of the story, but I certainly could have asked for everything else to be far better. Now, I understand that not every Mel Brooks film is going to be Blazing Saddles, but they all could have at least been decent. Dracula Dead and Loving It is just terrible.

I obviously can't speak for how accurately they portrayed the real Bonnie and Clyde but they certainly do an excellent job at making them lovable and exciting characters to watch have adventures on screen. Beatty plays Clyde as a man who puts on a rough and tough no holds bars face but really has a soft spot within him. And the stunning Faye Dunaway plays Bonnie as the insanely cool and wickedly ruthless girlfriend who always wants to be part of what's happening and is never afraid of the consequences. Together they make Bonnie and Clyde such an awesome pairing that we root for the entirety of the film.Now, from what I've read Bonnie and Clyde takes some liberties with what really happened, some of them unfair changes to characters just for the sake of idealizing the story. For instance, Estelle Parsons plays Blanche, Clyde's sister in law who comes along to join the Barrow gang with Clyde's brother Buck, played by Gene Hackman. The real Blanche Barrow was still alive when this film came out and was disgusted by the way her character was portrayed and real life accounts of the Barrow gang say that Blanche was not the terrified screaming maniac that she was in the film. Part of me wishes that these sorts of things wouldn't have happened, but then again it is Hollywood and it's just a movie that doesn't claim to be 100% accurate. Therefore I can put it behind me because the result of these alterations to history made by the filmmakers make Bonnie and Clyde a much more exciting and fun filled film.Overall Bonnie and Clyde is great. It's a lot of fun, tells a great story of two of America's most infamous outlaws, and is even a little artsy in its production.

It's really just to make clear that I'm not automatically dismissive of films that aren't event driven, or feature long periods where nothing much happens.In some ways Wings of Desire isn't really about all that much and I'm not even going to try to explain the few things which do happen in the film.

The first two thirds of the movie are spent wondering what it is you're actually watching, as there's not really much in the way of dialogue (at least not much of interest). The final third of the film gives us some sort of resolve to the film, although really by this point most viewers are likely to be bored out of their mind.

If Logan's Run, which premiered in 1976, had come out a year later, there's no way anyone would've remembered it in the midst of the Star Wars pandemonium that broke out in '77. In fact, Michael Anderson's sci-fi dystopia could've used a George Lucas\/Industrial Light and Magic touch.It's not that Logan's Run lacks for imagination, however, as it's a colorful, abstract vision and Anderson is unafraid to milk the effects and the production design, even if it means exposing how cheap they look.Based on the 1967 novel by William F. Nolan and George Clayton Johnson, Logan's Run takes place in the 23rd Century when what's left of humanity lives in domed cities with pleasure and happiness being the sole focus of existence. Not a raw deal, except for the fact that everyone's killed off at age 30 in order to maintain equilibrium. This catch causes many almost-30-year-olds to try and run, and it's Logan 5's (Michael York) job as a Sandman to stop them when they do.This world is more visually fleshed out than it is through storytelling. Everyone dresses in loose-fitting clothes of either red, green or yellow to indicate their age range and silver amusement park-like trains transport people between locations. Sex is also an open part of society, but for censorship reasons that doesn't quite come across.This dystopia is the focus of the first half of the film, and consequently it's superior half. There's plenty of date special effects to laugh at, but everything's too imaginative to not get excited or fascinated by it. The renewal ceremony for 30-year-olds hoping to be selected for a longer life is one of the most bizarre and delightfully unnecessary spectacles ever committed to film.But all along we know that Logan is the seed that will disrupt the system, so this rich, weird world begins to fade once we have the context Anderson feels we need to continue with the story. Logan is very happy with his role as a Sandman, but after exterminating a runner carrying the Ankh symbol, he's asked to secretly investigate by posing undercover as a runner. When he realizes he's about to have some years taken away from him and might not get them back, he turns into an actual runner. He seeks out Jessica (Jenny Agutter), a green girl who he previously saw wearing an Ankh and together they try and find the necessary channels to escape. On their trail, however, is Francis 7 (Richard Jordan), Logan's friend and Sandman partner.Sadly, when Logan and Jessica finally escape to the outside, the movie gets remarkably dull and the script even worse. The city is somewhere near Washington D.C., as we see the Capitol, the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial all covered in vines. Writer David Zelag-Goodman then wastes our time giving Logan and Jessica lines in which they wonder what life was like here long ago on the outside, a social commentary that's anything but subtle (or necessary). Considering our curiosity is all about what goes on inside the dome, this second act disappoints.In it, we meet Peter Ustinov's character, an old man who has been living in the House of Representatives. He's the only old man these people have ever met, but he carries no secrets for us. He's vital to this world and the story, but we never feel it because we have trouble empathizing in this regard with our main characters.But Logan's Run is still gutsy, over-the-top sci fi that would make Flash Gordon shed a tear. There's so much here that you want the film to explore that it never does (I would extremely welcome the planned remake from Nicolas Winding Refn starring Ryan Gosling), but the point is that you at least think about it.

It's not necessarily that the movie was horrible or incredibly boring; it's just that I find it to be one of the most forgettable film's I've ever seen. I've watched it a few times and for some reason I never remember much about it. I remember the premise of the film and that it stars Kevin Bacon, and that's about it. So I gave it another chance to see if maybe I just hadn't paid attention in the past and&#x85;nope. It's just forgettable. It's enjoyable enough while you're watching it thought. It's not a bad little ghost tale, with a few moments of decent suspense. In the movie, Kevin Bacon is Tom Witzky, a phone line maintenance tech that isn't content with the direction his life has taken. He lives with his wife and son in a small Chicago suburb where everyone knows everyone. One night at a party, Tom is hypnotized by his sister-in-law as a gag, but the fun is over when Tom finds himself plagued with terrifying hallucinations. He is haunted by visions of a teenage girl and feels the need to dig. His flashes lead him to believe that the hypnosis has opened a new door to his mind, and his investigations might lead him to uncover a secret that would shatter his peaceful neighborhood.I guess it just might've been overshadowed by some of the bigger titles released in 1999, but I just don't remember STIR OF ECHOES getting much attention. I hadn't even remembered it myself until I grabbed it on DVD as part of a two-DVD set. It's a fine little thriller with some moments of genuine creepiness buffered by a bunch of scenes with Kevin Bacon and a shovel. There aren't a lot of big names in the film, with the obvious exception of course being Bacon. Illeana Douglas (who was slightly more popular at the time of the film's release than she is now) is in the movie as Lisa Well, the protagonist's sister-in-law\/amateur hypnotist. Douglas is a cute face but I've never seen her as much of a dramatic actor and her scenes in the movie don't feel too genuine. The rest of the film is filled out with recognizable faces and forgettable names (including the father from the TRANSFORMERS series) that normally would relegate a film of this stature to direct-to-DVD status. Everyone does a fine job but I feel some blame falls on director David Koepp, an accomplished screenwriter with limited directing experience. Bacon provides the strongest performance while others falter, and I wish the scares had been a little stronger. Granted, this is just as much a mystery as a supernatural thriller but it felt cheap. The thrills are pretty barren and I would have liked a little more torment from the tortured soul of the teenage girl (played by a young and almost unrecognizable Jennifer Morrison).I would recommend STIR OF ECHOES as a decent viewing option on a rainy day when it's playing on cable. It's not really worth spending any cash on but, if you catch it for free, it doesn't disappoint. It's tense at times with a mystery that keeps your interest engaged until the final reveal. I wish they would've built more upon the whole psychic abilities the movie hints at with Bacon and his son. I wonder if these elements were built upon further in the novel the movie is based upon. I should also mention that, while I normally hate child actors, the one in this movie isn't as aggravating bad as most. So kudos to Zachary David Cope for that. Overall, the movie has a heavy vibe of a made-for-cable piece, and it's a shame because I think in the capable hands of a director with a real vision this movie could've rivaled THE SIXTH SENSE. Instead we're treated to a mildly entertaining one-off film that most people probably don't remember. I barely did.

I was dead bored while watching this.Though yes, it's a movie aimed for children, I get that, but even as a children's film this movie has very little to offer. The action scenes and the various battles that come with the Pokémon franchise are not horrible, I suppose, but neither do they manage to provide us with anything new or exciting. They're just on par with the battles from the TV series, which is really neither a plus or a minus. Furthermore, from a fan's point of view, I guess that it's nice to see more of Ash's mom and Charizard, one of the most popular Pokémon of the franchise. But both of these characters have very limited screen time, barely even having any dialogue in Mama Ketchum's case or having any cool battle scenes in the case of the latter.The biggest flaw of this movie is its villain though. Entei, the big furry monster in the cover, has some cool scenes, I admit, but the entity behind him\/it is very... nonthreatening and uncool. Like a big pile of floating Scrabble pieces. And it never talks, which just manages to underline just how boring it is as the main antagonist\/conflict.And of course the Team Rocket is in this movie to provide cheap jokes and unwanted slapstick.

I spontaneously told him, Well, the ship will still be sinking.. Ha ha&#x85; But seriously, it's an unforgettable experience and definitely worth seeing! James Cameron invites us to revisit the RMS Titanic and thiz time in 3D. And you know what? I still get goosebumps ever since the first 10 minutes I saw thiz movie. I admit that everyone can make a review on Titanic, surely everyone has something to say about thiz movie. It's not just that the ship is gigantic but also literally big as a movie. The Director James Cameron did explore almost everything. The real tragic event with the latest forensic science and one of the most beautiful stories ever told. Thiz is the man who brought you Aliens (1986), Terminator 2 Judgment Day (1991) and Avatar (2009). A simple adventurer Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) won a ticket in a lucky hand at poker for the journey of a lifetime, where he meets a desperate aristocrat Rose (Kate Winslet) who suffers anguish after being forced to marry a rich steel tycoon Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). The journey is going to change their lives forever. The other Cast members are Kathy Bates, Bill Paxton, Frances Fisher, Victor Garber and Bernard Hill as Captain Edward James Smith. The cinematography is splendid. What I do remember is the dynamic camera movements, the afternoon sunshine, the wind, the wave, everything! I'm always impressed by how they capture the moment of I'm Flying Scene, when Jack teaches Rose how to step over the big ship's prow and spread her arms wide. The chemistry seems so natural and sincere. The love story is compelling in every possible way. It's like Romeo and Juliet kind of thing. You Jump, I jump is also one of my absolute favorite moments. Yes, we do care about Jack and Rose. The elderly Rose who is played by Gloria Stuart also deserves mention for her memorable performance. Stuart successfully brings the story alive with her powerful storytelling. The song from Celine Dion, My Heart Will Go On is not just great, but it's legendary! Once again, it is worth watching in 3D. Although thiz re-release version is the conversion result from 2D standard material to 3D, but it's your best chance to experience the magical wonder which feels like you're actually standing on the deck of Titanic. One day you can proudly tell your kids or even grandchildren that you saw Titanic in the theater. Yes, thiz will be a historic moment! I have to say, I love the ending. It's one of the greatest ending scenes in cinematic history. Spoiler Alert! After the elderly Rose passes away, in afterlife somehow she's young again and meets the love of her life Jack at staircase in the main lobby of the Titanic. Then they're just kissing. It's so sweet and overwhelming. The movie reminds us that nothing is eternal, but still a specific moment can be eternal in our hearts. So are you ready to go back to Titanic?

The special affects and the sets are done so well, and that's important because the whole movie takes place on this spaceship. So you got to feel like you're on the ship with the characters. The Alien affects are also great, and won an Oscar for best special affects. Rightfully so.The actors all do a great job. Especially Sigourney Weaver. She did this movie early in her career, but it's still one of her best performances. You really feel her emotions and her determination when she's on screen.Last but very not least are the horror elements. The movie has a very dark atmosphere, and the dark corridors of the ship and the setting only add to this. The scenes with the alien are all intense and very affective. Especially the famous chest burst scene. I also think one of the main reasons it's so scary is that it starts of a little slow, but not too slow. It lets your guard down, it builds up, and then it hits you in the face. There are also a lot of moments that catch you off guard, but I'm not going to spoil anything.This is a perfect horror film, and a perfect science fiction film. Everybody should watch this movie. Get a bunch of your friends, turn off the lights, and turn on the movie. The darkness will add to the claustrophobic setting of being hunted on this vast and dark ship.

Many people (wrongly) thought that it was part of a prequel trilogy to the Star Wars movies, in which George Lucas had (allegedly) been involved in making many years ago, but anyone expecting a film like that would only be disappointed. The film isn't as serious as Spaceballs and it's also worth noting that the effects aren't as impressive, particularly the cartoon-style CGI, but this isn't a problem due to the comedic nature of the film; decent special effects would only have detracted from the gags and OTT acting. The movie pokes fun at the nonsensical storyline of Spaceballs by itself making very little sense at all, throwing in some humorous subplots about taxes and trade embargos for good measure.The film was so successful that George managed to once again line his pockets by licensing merchandise based on the film, which is pretty funny when you consider the scene in Spaceballs where they look at Yogurt's cave; this brilliant sense of irony is just one of the many things that proves George to be a very clever man indeed. He must've had a lot of fun making this film and it shows, as there's almost nothing here which you could take even remotely seriously. This is probably my favourite comedy movie from that year, although the sequels weren't quite as good (apart from the 'noooooo!' scene in the final film, which is possibly the funniest thing to feature in a film, EVER).Having read a lot of the reviews on IMDb, it disappoints me that so many people misunderstood what George was trying to achieve. Of course as a serious sci-fi movie this doesn't work, but the film was never supposed to have any artistic merit. So sit back and enjoy the brilliant film that George has made, and may the midi-chlorians be with you!
