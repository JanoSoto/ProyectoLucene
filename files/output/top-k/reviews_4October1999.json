Singles is clearly one of his best.  In short, the film revolves around six twenty-somethings who live in Seattle, and search for the right relationship while trying to figure out who they actually are.  Crowe is always in touch with his audience, and is somehow able to capture what they have gone through during some period of their life. Campbell Scott really stands out in this one as Steve, an upwardly mobile employee of the Department of Transportation.  Steve is just like you and me (I'm willing to bet we all know somebody like him).  He's nice, relatively easy going, smart, hip, motivated and painfully in need of the right relationship.  Steve is the classic example of a the nice guy who doesn't finish last, but can't get what he wants.  Scott is brilliant in his portrayal of Steve and is somehow so honest when showing his true feelings.  Matt Dillon (another stand out) on the other hand is Cliff Poncier, a wanna be rock star (and a poor one at that) who has three jobs, including being a delivery boy for a florist.  Without digressing into the plot, let's just say that Dillon\/Poncier is the classic example of a guy who doesn't realize what he has until its gone.  Dillon's comedic timing in this film is impeccable.  You often wait to see what this good natured clown is up to next (for those of you who have seen the film installing the stereo in Janet's car, the answering machine message, etc.).Singles is one of those films that you relate to all too well.

I had heard some reviewers comparing this film to The Graduate not knowing whether that was just hype or what.  After seeing this film last night, I can tell you that this is not hype - American Beauty is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen while at the same time one of the saddest.  As the Graduate took you behind the closed doors of suburbia and revolved around Dustin Hoffman's rebellion against society's expectations, American Beauty takes you back to suburbia and is centered around Kevin Spacey's desire to rediscover the man he used to before a marriage, fatherhood, work and suburbia destroyed what he used to be.  Spacey, playing a disgruntled middle aged married man named Lester Burnham, is the centerpiece of this movie and he is magnificent. His performance is intense yet never over the top. He is also very funny (Oscar voters -> While it is early on, I doubt you will find a more worthy Best Actor Oscar candidate than Spacey). Annette Bening is also wonderful as his wife Carolyn whose finds her marriage and her relationship with her daughter crumbling away.  I never knew she had this type of performance in her.  Thora Birch is also powerful in her role as their daughter Jane. But for my money the most amazing performances in this movie came from Wes Bentley as Rick Fitts and Chris Cooper as Rick's father Col. Fitts.  Bentley is phenomenal as the boy next door who can see things for what they really are through his video camera. He is perhaps the smartest and wisest person in this film because he has not lost track of what truly matters in life, even though his homophobic ex-marine father constantly presses him to become a better man. Lastly, kudos to Mena Suvari who is this year's American women with a great role in American Pie and a nice dramatic turn in American Beauty.  I look forward to seeing her again.There were great performances in this movie but without a great story there would be nothing.  This script is terrific, it zips along at a nice pace and the dialogue is so witty.  I think it is tough to do comedy, tough to do drama but to do both so well in the same movie is an achievement.  If this movie does not win a best screenplay Oscar - then I wanna see the movie that does win it because that script is gonna have to be phenomenal. Lastly the direction and cinematography was right on the mark!! Go see this movie, they don't make films like this often.

This film is based on the highly controversial biography of the late, great Hollywood diva.  The book spawned several copycat books, making movie stars think twice about how they treat their children.  Its impact was widespread, and I believe it is a major contributor to the way we view the private lives of stars today.Joan Crawford is played by Faye Dunaway (interestingly enough a woman who Joan once pegged as a bright light when Faye was first breaking into films).  The story is about her desire to have children (she can't have any of her own) and her treatment of two that she adopted (she adopted two others but they objected to being portrayed in this film).  According to Christina, Joan was not looking for a daughter, but rather a publicity stunt to boost her sagging career.  The film recounts several incidents that have since become legendary to Crawford's life and career.  Joan has a fit when she finds wire hangers in the closet.  She massacres the rose garden when MGM terminates her contract.  The children are victims of endless abuse, including being tied to the bed at night, eating raw meat and having to choose only one gift from the dozens that they receive at birthdays and Christmas.  Even in her adult years Christina must suffer the wrath of her mother.  Returning from boarding school she stands up to her mother in front of a reporter from Redbook.  Christina is nearly strangled.  When Christina falls ill during a run in a soap opera her aging mother takes over her part, unwittingly sabotaging her career (?).Anyone who knows anything about Joan Crawford knows that she is much more complicated than this story gives her credit.  Gossip about her is legendary and any Joan Crawford biography worth the paper its printed on is full of hot innuendo.  We also know that Joan was a fighter.  At the risk of sounding cliche, in those days, you had to be!  Using her own gumption, Crawford was able to establish herself as one of the leading stars of the 1930's.  She played the shopgirl with a heart of gold and chest of steel.  Her fans loved her. When her career started to wane, primarily because the studio thought she was getting too old, Crawford must have taken it hard. I loved this movie, but I certainly don't take it seriously.  If these incidents make Crawford a child abuser, then many parents out there should pay heed.  I mean, come on.  We're all entitled to a few bad days.  And it wasn't like Christina was deprived!  In fact the movie is even smart enough to point out that Christina was an obstinent child, certainly the perfect match for her mother! Mommie Dearest is more of a tribute to a career that has become high camp.  Look at any Joan Crawford movie today and you can see just how over the top she can be.  This is not a slight to her acting, because she was good. Faye Dunaway is (for lack of a better word) fabulous playing the lead part.  Diana Scarwid is passable as daughter Christina only because her rotten performance compliments the high camp surrounding this story.  I have heard people complain that the child abuse in this movie was simply too much for them.  I say watch it from another level.

Gossip about her is legendary and any Joan Crawford biography worth the paper its printed on is full of hot innuendo.  We also know that Joan was a fighter.  At the risk of sounding cliche, in those days, you had to be!  Using her own gumption, Crawford was able to establish herself as one of the leading stars of the 1930's.  She played the shopgirl with a heart of gold and chest of steel.  Her fans loved her. When her career started to wane, primarily because the studio thought she was getting too old, Crawford must have taken it hard. I loved this movie, but I certainly don't take it seriously.  If these incidents make Crawford a child abuser, then many parents out there should pay heed.  I mean, come on.  We're all entitled to a few bad days.  And it wasn't like Christina was deprived!  In fact the movie is even smart enough to point out that Christina was an obstinent child, certainly the perfect match for her mother! Mommie Dearest is more of a tribute to a career that has become high camp.  Look at any Joan Crawford movie today and you can see just how over the top she can be.  This is not a slight to her acting, because she was good. Faye Dunaway is (for lack of a better word) fabulous playing the lead part.  Diana Scarwid is passable as daughter Christina only because her rotten performance compliments the high camp surrounding this story.  I have heard people complain that the child abuse in this movie was simply too much for them.  I say watch it from another level.  This is not a film to be taken seriously, but rather a glitzy 'drag show'.  Enjoy!

The Three Kings is not worth your time. A politically correct film about Iraqis and the Persian Gulf War neatly bundled with enough exploding violence and sidetracked stories to make it seem interesting. Three Kings doesn't work as anything but a &#145;kindlier and gentler' war story.  The film tries to present a moral tale about rag-tag men who can somehow, even in the face of war, change and be better.  The Three Godfathers is a classic moral tale told in a much more direct and realistic way.  Three Kings gives us superficial characters, stereotypic Arab behavior, and just enough overhanging guilt to paper over a contrived ending.  Yes, the coalition forces won the Gulf War but betrayed the embattled rebels in their own futile war with Saddam.  George Bush became an overnight savior but his name soon personified the fickle American Army whose presence was felt more in damage and destruction than in liberation.  And so in Three Kings, we have a reversal of form in which four men, whose initial goal is to steal back Kuwaiti gold for themselves, end up doing good instead.  The film also highlights insipid soldiers, to the point of making us wonder if they are the only kind of foot soldiers we have.  The character, Conrad Vig, is stupid, racist, loud-mouth, and out of control. Equally dumb are the chaperoned soldiers who take an arrogant and aggressive newswoman named Cruz, all over the desert.    When the movie finally tries to make a statement about war, it does so badly.  Take the interrogation between Troy Barlow and his Iraqi captor. In between electric shocks and physical torture (which don't seem to have any purpose), Barlow empathizes about how he would not want a foreign country to bomb his home and kill his children.  Three Kings could have been a fair action picture if you take out any messages.  Instead, by trying to portray sides equally, it badly diluted any messages at all.

Although for my money it lacks the even-handed emotional resonance of Ang Lee's The Ice Storm, American Beauty one-ups the previous film by trading the irreplaceably funny Oscar winner Kevin Kline for yet another irreplaceably funny Oscar winner by the name of Kevin, Mr. Spacey.  Of course many Americans have seen Spacey chew the scenery in such dynamically lively roles as The Usual Suspects, Seven, A Time to Kill and L.A. Confidential without ever being able to identify him by name.  American Beauty should remedy that situation right away.Spacey plays put-upon advertising executive Lester Burnham, a man with a penchant for masturbating in the shower, masking his contempt for the a****les in charge at the office and sitting spinelessly at the supper table listening to the insomnia-curing dementia of Tin Pan Alley tunes preferred by his rigid realtor wife Carolyn (Annette Bening). Indeed he no longer communicates with his daughter Jane(Thora Birch), a rebellious young cheerleader playing a nondescript game of follow-the-leader with her model-wannabe colleague Angela (Mena Suvari).  Of course Angela awakens Lester out of the apathetic hellhole he had been entrenched in before, and with the help of his new teen-age next-door neighbor Ricky (Wes Bentley), Lester tries to overcome his encroaching middle age through a cycle of working out, smoking pot and fantasizing of Angela in a heap of rose petals.Ricky's life indeed is no picnic, as he tries to escape the demented militance of his ex-Marine father (Chris Cooper) through a gallery of videotapes which include everything from a dead bird to a plastic bag blowing gently in the breeze.  Although labeled as an outcast at school, young Jane looks past the superficial ramblings of her experienced best friend and proceeds to look beyond Ricky's initial facade.As framed by cinematographer Conrad L. Hall (In Cold Blood), American Beauty has the same falsely bright, almost dizzyingly surreal colors which have defined such similar films as Blue Velvet and The Truman Show. Unlike those two films, however, Beauty doesn't try to evade its material through metaphor or Lynchian vision; instead, it stares unblinkingly into the lives of a group of people, each with their own little hang-ups. Indeed what forty-year old man wouldn't identify with Lester as he flips the finger to his malcontent superiors and shrugs off all responsibility in returning to that haven of simplicity, the fast-food chain?  And who wouldn't admire the sheer combination of bravado and insight Ricky contains as he provides his inspiration for Lester?  These identifiable characters form the core of Sam Mendes' debut film, an exquisite find which at times manages to expose an inherently mechanical processing behind its plotting through unbelievable shifts in logic. One scene in particular essays this (READ NO FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE!) Ricky's father sees what he believes is his son performing oral sex on Lester when in reality all he's doing is supplying him with pot.  This is a low point of Alan Ball's screenplay, which sketches this character almost to the point of stereotype (were it not for Cooper's masterly performance, one would be inclined to write this mistake off as bigger than it is).Yet this is one of the few flaws which periodically punctuate Alan Ball's biting screenplay.  Although millions of Americans live in the suburbs even now, very few have the courage to admit their own narcolepsy resulting from such deceptive terms as comfort.  By the end of American Beauty, Spacey's character begins to merit a sort of predestined glory which makes his inevitable destiny seem both heartbreaking and, finally,life-affirming.

Indeed he no longer communicates with his daughter Jane(Thora Birch), a rebellious young cheerleader playing a nondescript game of follow-the-leader with her model-wannabe colleague Angela (Mena Suvari).  Of course Angela awakens Lester out of the apathetic hellhole he had been entrenched in before, and with the help of his new teen-age next-door neighbor Ricky (Wes Bentley), Lester tries to overcome his encroaching middle age through a cycle of working out, smoking pot and fantasizing of Angela in a heap of rose petals.Ricky's life indeed is no picnic, as he tries to escape the demented militance of his ex-Marine father (Chris Cooper) through a gallery of videotapes which include everything from a dead bird to a plastic bag blowing gently in the breeze.  Although labeled as an outcast at school, young Jane looks past the superficial ramblings of her experienced best friend and proceeds to look beyond Ricky's initial facade.As framed by cinematographer Conrad L. Hall (In Cold Blood), American Beauty has the same falsely bright, almost dizzyingly surreal colors which have defined such similar films as Blue Velvet and The Truman Show. Unlike those two films, however, Beauty doesn't try to evade its material through metaphor or Lynchian vision; instead, it stares unblinkingly into the lives of a group of people, each with their own little hang-ups. Indeed what forty-year old man wouldn't identify with Lester as he flips the finger to his malcontent superiors and shrugs off all responsibility in returning to that haven of simplicity, the fast-food chain?  And who wouldn't admire the sheer combination of bravado and insight Ricky contains as he provides his inspiration for Lester?  These identifiable characters form the core of Sam Mendes' debut film, an exquisite find which at times manages to expose an inherently mechanical processing behind its plotting through unbelievable shifts in logic. One scene in particular essays this (READ NO FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE!) Ricky's father sees what he believes is his son performing oral sex on Lester when in reality all he's doing is supplying him with pot.  This is a low point of Alan Ball's screenplay, which sketches this character almost to the point of stereotype (were it not for Cooper's masterly performance, one would be inclined to write this mistake off as bigger than it is).Yet this is one of the few flaws which periodically punctuate Alan Ball's biting screenplay.  Although millions of Americans live in the suburbs even now, very few have the courage to admit their own narcolepsy resulting from such deceptive terms as comfort.  By the end of American Beauty, Spacey's character begins to merit a sort of predestined glory which makes his inevitable destiny seem both heartbreaking and, finally,life-affirming.  ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"4 October 1999","score":"","review":"  I feel it is appropriate to use John W. Campbell Jr.'s 1938 novella, Who Goes There?, as a baseline by which to compare the two films that strived to bring it to the screen; that is, The Thing(From Another World) released in 1951, and The Thing released in 1982.  Keep in mind that I consider Campbell's tale one of the best sci-fi horror stories ever written, and that it would be quite a feat to successfully adapt it to cinema. The 1951 film, directed by Christain Nyby, deviated so much from the story that it is difficult to draw many parallels between the two.  In the story, the alien is a 4 ft tall being with three red eyes, rubbery,blue,wormlike hair and multiple razor- sharp tentacles.  This alien chameleon is so intelligent that its species figured out long ago how to imitate any living creature through DNA duplication and replication.  This uncanny, insidious imitation extended to the personality and mind of it's victims.  The end of the story further highlights its superior intellect by featuring a strap-on anti-gravity device powered by a small atomic generator that it had built within the mere span of one week by scrounging spare parts at the compound - coiled wires, radio tubes, coffee-tins, glass, magnets, leather and cloth belts, etc.  The alien was killed before it could make it's escape and eventually imitate the living composition of the entire planet! In the 1951 film version, the alien is portrayed as an 8 ft tall hairless Frankenstein-like humanoid, with flesh of a vegetable- like quality which needed blood to reproduce itself through seedpods.  The film is standard horrorfare, with the expedition crew uniting together to fight and destroy the alien menace, which they eventually did, via electrocution.  The alien is not characterized as particularly intelligent, rather as a rampaging, blood-thirsty monster; making it hard to imagine such a brute was advanced enough to participate in interstellar travel.  So while, The Thing(From Another World) featured excellent direction, acting, dialogue, score and so forth under the watchful eye of producer\/shadow director, Howard Hawks, I feel he took artistic license and deviated too much from Campbell's story. There was suspense and terror to be sure, but it lacked the pervasive paranoia that Campbell conveyed so well in Who Goes There? In sharp contrast, director John Carpenter's 1982 version, The Thing, both brilliantly captures the alien's insidious chameleon-like powers (through Rob Bottin's effects) and the paranoia it induced amongst the expedition's crew.  Instead of bonding together as a cohesive unit as in the 1951 film, to fight a readily discernable foe, they fragmented in the face of a remarkably cunning enemy capable of imitating any one of them; they become deeply suspicious and paranoid of one another as any of them could be the alien in disguise, and they literally ask, is it really you, WHO GOES THERE?; echoing the name of the novella's title.  This situation runs counter to classic character development, as how could anyone be stable and well-defined with their core-identity as such risk? Who's who? who's the good guy? bad guy?  Perhaps a little unsettling to viewers and critics.  I think this film has received a  battering from movie critics because they were weaned on relishing a steady, inexorable buildup of suspense and an inevitable resolution.  However, in The Thing, this suspense is permeated with a claustrophobic paranoia and sullen dread, generating an atmospheric ambiguity - something the critics weren't comfortable with, hence, rejected. Combine this ambiguity with the critic's aversion to the graphic special effects, wholly appropriate to the storyline, but misinterpreted by them as gratuitous violence and gore, then one understands why The Thing got butchered in the reviews. Here, as in the Campbell story, MacReady is the acknowledged hero, even before he tested himself as human, for we instinctively knew he would be.  However, in the story, MacReady, with the aid of several genuinely human crewmembers, kills the alien and in doing so, literally saves the planet. Whereas, in the 1982 film, MacReady, valiant as he is, just isn't powerful enough to stop the alien. Thus, the open-ended ending; the lack of closure being a disappointment to me; I immediately thought sequel, but have yet to see one.  Also, keep in mind that in the story, the alien starts and ends with his original form, whereas in the 1982 film, the alien never has a definitive original form, being relatively amorphous throughout. In the final analysis, I like both of these films, in spite of their shortcomings; namely, the 1951 film's failure to adhere closely to the story, thereby failing to capture the essence of the imitative alien and paranoid atmosphere it generated; and the 1982 film's failure to remain faithful to the story's optimistic ending. Actually, both films stand up fairly well when referenced to Campbell's chilling tale, and even better when viewed as stand-alones. One thing is for sure, both films have earned a secure place in my video collection. ","genre":null},{"date":"4 October 1999","score":"","review":"  I feel it is appropriate to use John W.

This was patronising and offensive, and the way such films had a hidden, moral, 'parental' agenda was a complete betrayal of those for whom they presumed to speak.   HEATHERS is a fun film, but it leaves a nasty taste in the mouth - and I'm not talking about the murder spree.Lately, though, films have come along, which, like  LES 400 COUPS, relate adolescent experience from an adolescent point of view, coloured by an adolescent framework.  This is not to say the films aren't adult or complex, it's just that the grown-ups' memories have not a mocking 'mature' commentary undermining them.  RUSHMORE is the most obvious example, although SOUTH PARK is perhaps the idea's apotheosis.All of this is by way of saying that ELECTION seemed to be continuing this trend.  We are offered four voiceovers - four points of views - which leads us to expect a splintered, cubist view of experience, an unloaded battle between youth and authority as well as youth against youth (much more dramatic).  Unfortunately, there aren't really four points of view at all, just one - that of a self-righteous, feckless loser of an Ethics teacher (although the irony of having former youth star Matthew Broderick playing him is very funny).  For all its youthful sheen and energy, this is yet another white man's mid-life crisis.This is all the more surprising considering the film was made by MTV. There was a lot of sneering at this, as if the film would be just a glorified pop-video, filled with no-brainer tricks.  As it is, ELECTION is funnier, more clever and better made than most of the rubbish churned out contemptuously by major and indie alike this year.  The main problem is that the style isn't worked out properly.  The film fairly bounces along, with day-glo sets, stylised performances and dialogue, smart, oblique situations, breezy pacing, funny editing, sketch-like construction, odd camera angles. This is perfectly in keeping with a film about adolescent crises, but surely not with the story of a burned-out, washed-up, frustrated failure.  It could be argued that the style represents manic youth impinging  on his life, but the fact is that his problems have nothing (directly) to do with his pupils - they are the archetypal traumas of a man his age.ELECTION is still a very enjoyable film.  The individual teenagers are a clever microcosm of America, with the go-getters doing well, but the dorky rich kids doing just fine too.  The figure of Paul is the (unscathed) object of the film's best satire - he is the archetypal football jock - rich popular, an absolute idiot, who takes everything in his beaming, moronic stride, knowing that everything's going to be just dandy, whatever setbacks pop up.  He is such a braindead goofball, you revel in Tracy's every attempt to thwart him - better the hard-working go-getter than the smug parasite.She's a bit frightening too, though, and it's typical of the film's older male bias that she's plainly a caricature, only saved by Reece Witherspoon's brilliant observation of the neurosis, fear and anxiety behind the brittle confidence.  The story of Paul's sister is the film's most appealing and moving, a rare case of an actual human being getting through the net, although we could have done with more of her.ELECTION is quite clever on politics too, on the overwhelming, yet perfectly understandable, even admirable apathy of a generation.  Tracy's new conservatism is a joyless Orwellian horror, while the smug liberalism of Mr. M. (surely a nod to Fritz Lang's study of the corruption of childhood) is an ineffective fraud.

The action was really well done.The Story was even better.This was Arnolds best film he did as a villan.I would say the ending was a little weird., how Resse Died.

With a great supporting cast and a PERFECT casting for the lead actress, Gilda is one of the most surprising movies I have ever seen. I was completely caught off guard by the action, tension, humor, and romance that blend so perfectly.  Film noir was never so glamorous.  The evil-husband is a great another great performance, along with the men's room attendant (a great mixture of comedy, drama, and action).  One great scene after another, never a chance to stop and catch your breath, ending with a superb climax.  This one deserves a 10 in my book... and should be included in the top 250... in my opinion.

The movie, however, could best be described as fine but flawed, with the bad points outnumbering the good.The good points can be easily discussed First, there is the energetic performance of Mitzi Gaynor as Nellie Forbush, a role for which Doris Day had supposedly been considered when filming was announced. Yes, it would have been great to have had Mary Martin repeating one of her greatest stage successes. But Martin, at 45, would have been just a little too old for the part when viewed by a merciless movie camera, plus, none of her half-dozen or so movies were all that satisfactory. She seemed to need a live audience to bring out her best. Gaynor, on the other hand, had just the right qualities for the part. She had plenty of bounce, lots of personality, and, at 27, was young enough for the role. Juanita Hall was also super repeating her Broadway role as Bloody Mary. Why she had to be dubbed, and why she wasn't even nominated for Best Supporting Actress at Oscar time (Dame Wendy Hiller won for the all-but-forgotten Seperate Tables) is almost as great a mystery as Maurice Chevalier's not being nominated for Gigi that same year.So much for the good points. Most of the other performers come off as stiff, particularly John Kerr as Lieut. Cable. Ray Walston comes off as just plain wrong for Luther Billis, loud and unfunny most of the way. And Rossanno Brazzi, who was more of a prescense than an actor anyway, is all wrong as DeBeque.The biggest bone of contention, however, is just this Whose idea were those stupid colored filters, anyway? They add nothing to the film and are, in fact, just plain distracting. The first time I saw this movie, I kept adjusting the color controls on my TV, thinking that it had gone out of order.But, I guess, a flawed version of this American classic is better than no version at all. But a great R&H adaptation it is most definitely NOT! You'd have to go to Oklahoma!, The King and I, and, towering above them all, The Sound of Music for that.
