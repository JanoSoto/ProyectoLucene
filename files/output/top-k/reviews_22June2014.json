[{"date":"22 June 2014","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" With another Wachowski brothers movie on the horizon, I thought it appropriate to go back and review their first ambitious offering. For a movie that was produced in early 1999, everything about the movie still feels new. Of course some of the tech has changed over the past 15 years but it's not a hard stretch to picture that this movie takes place in today's world. The movie challenges the viewer with questions we have all asked ourselves, What would I do to preserve or gain freedom? , Is reality real? and Do I control my future or is it already decided for me by fate? The theme the Wachowski brothers present in the movie is one of basic human needs, one all humans can relate to, freedom and freewill. This theme is presented early as we discover Thomas Anderson, played by Keanu Reeves, is leading a double life. One where in the day time he is working for a successful software company as a developer and at night he is known as the underground hacker Neo. For those that know, working a 9 to 5 job is necessary but sometimes feels like a prison. I believe this is why the alter ego of Neo personifies the act of expressing freedom. By actively defying the man, Neo shows that there is something missing in his existence that he is trying to fill. This is where Morpheus, played by Laurence Fishburne, comes into the picture. He offers Neo a chance to find out what true freedom is by offering a way out of his normal routine with a simple choice, red pill or blue pill. Neo chooses to go down the rabbit hole and this is where he and the viewer discovers that the reality presented previous to this moments was all a simulation known as the Matrix that robots had created to simulate actual existence in order to keep the humans complacent as a power source. Once Neo is ejected from the Matrix he learns that the real reality is one that is bleak. The world has all but been destroyed in a human versus robot war that lead to the near extinction of the human race and the near destruction of earth. He is presented with a reality were humans are not the dominate species, but one that live a life of fear and seclusion. This motif paints a desolate picture and makes the viewer and Neo question wither it was the right decision to leave the Matrix. This plays well into the threat to the real reality, as among them, Cypher, played by Joe Pantoliano, does not think the real reality was the right choice at all and would do anything to be ignorant once again. Once we learn of the Matrix, the Wachowski brothers use some interesting techniques in their filming to highlight the hyper-reality of the matrix. They accomplish this in many of the action scenes of the movie by using the slow motion effect to emphasize the speed at which the humans that are jacked into the matrix can move. One scene in particular is where Neo successfully avoids being shot by moving out of the way of bullets as they are hurling towards him. The main conflict in the story is between the machines and the humans. The machine want to extinguish any remaining human resistance so they can continue to use the human as a power source unchallenged. They do this in the real world by deploying very aggressive, seek and destroy tactics executed by Sentinel robots. Likewise in the matrix there are regulator programs know as Agents that are actively policing any anomalies like foreign minds in the system. These oppressive concepts tie right back into the main them of freedom and freewill, the one thing the humans are seeking for themselves and all of the other humans trapped in the matrix. The key component in this conflict is Neo. He is recognized as The One that can over through the system, however it is not always clear if he is the actual One or not. There is a scene shortly after Neo exits the matrix where he is taken to see a prophet known as The Oracle, played by Gloria Foster. In his meeting with the Oracle she tells Neo that he is in fact not the one and challenges him with a life or death scenario. This is where the theme of freewill versus fate come into the balance as Neo struggles with what was revealed to him. As the movie plays out Neo is revealed to truly be The One as he chooses to not let Morpheus sacrifice himself based on what was revealed to him by the Oracle. In this act he reveals that he indeed can manipulate the matrix to his own will. However it is not fully revealed until Neo actually dies. In this scene the sound is focused on Trinity's voice, played by Carrie-Anne Moss, as she explains that Neo cannot be dead because the Oracle told her that she would fall in love with The One. Just at the nick of time as the Sentinels were destroying the human ship, Neo reanimates and now has full control of the Matrix and destroys Agent Smith , played by Hugo Weaving, just before exiting the Matrix in time to destroy the Sentinels with an EMP. The Matrix does a very good job at emphasizing its theme of freedom and freewill. The use of a great story and ground breaking visual effects for its time, really make this movie withstand the test of time and makes it and instant classic. I do not anticipate any time in the foreseeable future that a viewer will not be able to relate to the theme presented in the movie. If history has taught us anything, it's that freedom and freewill will always be front and foremost on the minds of all human beings.

With a very overblown budget, people had very high expectations about this movie, aside from the fact that Kevin Costner not only stars, but was not credited for co-directing the movie (along with Kevin Reynolds). It seems that Costner finds himself type-cast in the same roles we've seen him in before and after Waterworld (Dances with Wolves, Field of Dreams and Message in the Bottle) as a drifter trying to find a meaning to life while struggling with the world he's living in currently. The final product results in nothing more but one big mess. Not an immensely messy movie, but still enough to leave one fully disapproved. The idea for this movie is actually quite original in its rather cynical look into an uncertain future. But what really let the film down was the writing. Hollywood has proved that just because the settings are remarkable and the performances were pretty good, a movie of this calibre cannot survive on just those credits alone. Our movie shows us an Earth that has been flooded after the effects of global warming has shifted to epic proportions. The surviving humans' only dry areas are makeshift boats, self-built islands and other assorted floating contraptions. The inhabitants have the feeling of no hope in the search of finding dry land. Suddenly a hybrid appears on the scene and kid with a drawing of dry land tattooed on her back become the ray of light in finding, the planet's last dry land area. As they try to save humankind, palm trees are grown and coconut is offered for these survivors to live off by. The details have quite a lot of unsatisfying results which I will gladly elucidate. While, they show us their means of survival in this landless society that dwells upon them, the concepts never go into full effect which makes makes us care very little about them which at times becomes quite laborious to the point where I start to get seasick. I find it shameful that the nameless Mariner (Costner) may have the natural talent of breathing underwater, which is a talent to good use in this flooded atmosphere, he continuously get condemned for being a freak by the other inhabitants, which shows that their world and our world is no different in judging people who have rather unorthodox traits. Then you have nasty, evil villains who have no motive as to why they are bad to begin with. And these bad guys so smoke, therefore an overlong ant-smoking campaign appears in this movie where it should not be. So, the way I see these unlikable bunch, you have one decent civilian who's ostracized for being different, but at the same time we have villains for the sake of being villains. Hard to point the less of two evils. No? Top that off with pop culture references and you have an awkwardly absurd movie. For an enormous budget of over $175 million, the settings and the cinematography was very impressive. However, I still don't see the necessity of having to spend so much money on a rather simplistic set. I can see the effort put into building a floating landscape, but I think it would have been more frugal if they just made a non-floating scenario with more carefully crafted camera angles put into the film just to make it more vivid complete with a smaller budget. The acting was overall very overcooked in many areas. Dennis Hopper who plays the top villain as the Deacon seems to have fun here, but his role falls flat in the long end. Kevin Costner meanwhile, lacks the charm or panache as the Mariner as we wonder if he's being heroic to the people or if he's doing it for himself. The real standouts for me comes from Tina Majorino as the adorable Enola and Jeanne Tripplehorn as the legal guardian for Enola, Helen. After that the supporting cast were pretty much bland.If you like to see a more quality version of this movie, I'd suggest you purchase the Extended Edition DVD that was released in 2008.

Most have focused on the American Civil War or stories that take place during that time but not directly involved. As for western films that are based between 1870s and the early 1900s, doesn't feel all that popular of a time zone. This story however is a real life based event. Sadly, as much as I've heard and read about how terrible it was and how badly it performed at the box office, I still wanted to enjoy what was given to its viewers. IT IS a movie that is exceptionally and competently made. The actors are convincing, the music is appropriate, the realism is explicit and the story has an interesting premise. Yet, the writing and direction is what makes this film almost unbearable.The story is about lawman James Averill (Kris Kristofferson) who learns that a group government officials have decided that the immigrants of Averill's county are nothing but leeches that pillage the loyal citizens cattle for money. This is what they believe, when in fact, these judged immigrants are in fact just people trying to get by in life. To help these people, Averill makes it his mission to help these wrongfully accused individuals. This premise is great. Seeing civil unrest is a different concept that not many people see enough of now a days. At least in the movies. Along with Kristofferson, the cast includes Christopher Walken (as Nathan Champion), Brad Dourif, John Hurt, Richard Masur, Jeff Bridges and even Mickey Rourke. And they all put in very good performances. Here is where it fails though.The writing is all over the place. Even though the actors perform well, the characterizations of their roles are either misguided, unclear or confused. Here are some examples; Kristofferson's character goes through a series of flip-flops and its not just about the main plot. Bridges' character seems to have no motivation other than to faithfully follow Averill blindly. He just hops on the bandwagon. John Hurt's character opposes the government officials' plan, yet later on is spectating the whole set of events. Also he's drunk half the time saying, silly things about Paris. Then there's the main girl named Ella (Isabelle Huppert) who Averill and Champion both love. And I'm sure most viewers know how that turns out since it's a love triangle. It's because of this that the screenplay makes these characters not extremely likable. Again, they were well performed but the charm is barely there.On top of that, the direction is very, very slow. Long running time films are not a problem if they are tightly woven and the story has substance. Gettysburg (1993) by Ronald F. Maxwell is one of those films and mind you, that it's even longer than this movie. Sadly, the way the story of this conflict plays out, could've been condensed into a much shorter running time, if the story was going to move at such sluggish pace. The assumption behind all the time wasted, was that there are numerous scenes where either nothing is being said or done that has doesn't have any relevance, or the scene may just contain what looks like background shots of everyday life of that particular time. Of course, viewers want to get an idea of what life was like back in that time but it doesn't need to drag on and on and on.Adding to that never ending feeling are the actors who play the immigrants. The fact that they are playing immigrants isn't the problem because they too act very well. Viewers may have problems with the fact that subtitles aren't used. Just watching a bunch of people arguing and speaking gibberish to most is boring and uninteresting. If you don't know the language, would watching a movie spoken entirely without subtitles entertain? Probably not. And to sit through that for almost four hours is really pushing people's patience. Having immigrants speak their native language is realistic yes, but to watch it give no purpose to the plot is flat out silly. The only thing that helps it bring it to a bearable status is the production value.The set design, props and realist conflicts that take place are noteworthy. Complimenting that is Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography. Holy hannah does Zsigmond get some amazing shots. This guy gets everything from fields, mountains and forest backgrounds. Even the town and train station set pieces are amazing to look at for how enormous they are. Zsigmond was also the cinematographer for Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and later also worked on Maverick (1994). Then there's David Mansfield's music. This is Mansfield's first theatrical score and although there is no main theme or orchestra to match the film's large scope, he ironically still makes the music work by using a single guitar like instrument. The contrast of the singular music one string tunes vs its big scale match, even though they are polar opposites. It's not memorable but it did work.The grandiose production value and talented cast is its strongest asset. Sadly its not enough because everything gets squandered from slow pacing and an under whelming script that fails to develop its characters properly.

Even though the actors perform well, the characterizations of their roles are either misguided, unclear or confused. Here are some examples; Kristofferson's character goes through a series of flip-flops and its not just about the main plot. Bridges' character seems to have no motivation other than to faithfully follow Averill blindly. He just hops on the bandwagon. John Hurt's character opposes the government officials' plan, yet later on is spectating the whole set of events. Also he's drunk half the time saying, silly things about Paris. Then there's the main girl named Ella (Isabelle Huppert) who Averill and Champion both love. And I'm sure most viewers know how that turns out since it's a love triangle. It's because of this that the screenplay makes these characters not extremely likable. Again, they were well performed but the charm is barely there.On top of that, the direction is very, very slow. Long running time films are not a problem if they are tightly woven and the story has substance. Gettysburg (1993) by Ronald F. Maxwell is one of those films and mind you, that it's even longer than this movie. Sadly, the way the story of this conflict plays out, could've been condensed into a much shorter running time, if the story was going to move at such sluggish pace. The assumption behind all the time wasted, was that there are numerous scenes where either nothing is being said or done that has doesn't have any relevance, or the scene may just contain what looks like background shots of everyday life of that particular time. Of course, viewers want to get an idea of what life was like back in that time but it doesn't need to drag on and on and on.Adding to that never ending feeling are the actors who play the immigrants. The fact that they are playing immigrants isn't the problem because they too act very well. Viewers may have problems with the fact that subtitles aren't used. Just watching a bunch of people arguing and speaking gibberish to most is boring and uninteresting. If you don't know the language, would watching a movie spoken entirely without subtitles entertain? Probably not. And to sit through that for almost four hours is really pushing people's patience. Having immigrants speak their native language is realistic yes, but to watch it give no purpose to the plot is flat out silly. The only thing that helps it bring it to a bearable status is the production value.The set design, props and realist conflicts that take place are noteworthy. Complimenting that is Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography. Holy hannah does Zsigmond get some amazing shots. This guy gets everything from fields, mountains and forest backgrounds. Even the town and train station set pieces are amazing to look at for how enormous they are. Zsigmond was also the cinematographer for Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and later also worked on Maverick (1994). Then there's David Mansfield's music. This is Mansfield's first theatrical score and although there is no main theme or orchestra to match the film's large scope, he ironically still makes the music work by using a single guitar like instrument. The contrast of the singular music one string tunes vs its big scale match, even though they are polar opposites. It's not memorable but it did work.The grandiose production value and talented cast is its strongest asset. Sadly its not enough because everything gets squandered from slow pacing and an under whelming script that fails to develop its characters properly.

Most have focused on the American Civil War or stories that take place during that time but not directly involved. As for western films that are based between 1870s and the early 1900s, doesn't feel all that popular of a time zone. This story however is a real life based event. Sadly, as much as I've heard and read about how terrible it was and how badly it performed at the box office, I still wanted to enjoy what was given to its viewers. IT IS a movie that is exceptionally and competently made. The actors are convincing, the music is appropriate, the realism is explicit and the story has an interesting premise. Yet, the writing and direction is what makes this film almost unbearable.The story is about lawman James Averill (Kris Kristofferson) who learns that a group government officials have decided that the immigrants of Averill's county are nothing but leeches that pillage the loyal citizens cattle for money. This is what they believe, when in fact, these judged immigrants are in fact just people trying to get by in life. To help these people, Averill makes it his mission to help these wrongfully accused individuals. This premise is great. Seeing civil unrest is a different concept that not many people see enough of now a days. At least in the movies.

His mom teaches him about life and to chose his own destiny in life. Tom Hank plays the role of Forrest Gump. Robin Wright is Jenny Curran, Gary Sinise plays Lt. Dan, Mykelti Williamson plays Bubba, and Sally Fields plays Forrest Gump's Momma Mrs. Gump. The movie opens with Gump sitting on a park bench and he picks up a feather. He will begin telling his story starting when he first met Jenny. Jenny has helped him when he was little by telling him to run from his bullies. Forrest were leg braces as a child, and when he ran one day, his braces broke off, and he never wore them again. Forrest began to fall in love with Jenny, but she had her own demons. Jenny would move away, and Forrest would begin his journey in life. First begin the Vietnam War. At the end of the war, he would once again be reunited with Jenny. And she would also once again leave him again as she does a couple of times. As he sits and talks to everyone that would sit on the park bench, he remembers everything that he has done in his life up to the time he is sitting there. His love for his Jenny is strong. He also makes some good friends along his way. The first being Lt. Dan from the army. And Bubba from the war. He would lose Bubba in the war, but Gump tried to save him. But as Gump moves forward, he would honor his friend Bubba when Gump gets some money. Lt Dan would help Gump in the shrimping business.Another major scene takes place when we find out why Gump is sitting on the park bench. He goes to see Jenny, and finds out that he is a father. Gump also learns that Jenny is sick. They end up being married, where Lt. Dan comes back to attend the wedding. Gump spends the rest of the days taking care of Jenny, and then taking care of his son, once Jenny passes away.Thinking of a movie that is similar to Forrest Gump would be the Notebook. In the Notebook, there is narration like Forrest Gump. There is a man in love with a women, and they go different ways, but do end up back together. Both movies are symbols of love. I'm a big fan of Forrest Gump. He goes beyond everything to find his love. Even though they weren't together, he still loved her, and only her. That love he has for Jenny, would bring them back together and they would have a son. Just like his mom told him to find his own destiny in life, he never stopped searching for his Jenny.

Thus, the result was that Mancini had no ideas left on how to continue the story of Charles Lee Ray, stuck in a Good Guy Doll's body. I mean can you blame him? It was baffling enough how in the name of all that's holy how to bring back Chucky from the original Child's Play (1988). Instead of being disassembled, Chucky's head was blown off this time. How do you bring someone back after that? Mancini found a way, but it's certainly not as forgivable as it was for the first sequel.The story surprisingly makes good use of its history and starts off with showing the aged and dusty factory of where the finale of the last film ended. There, the headless body of Chucky is melted down and remade. This apparently brings him back again. The continuity is great but how is that though? It was acceptable to a point in Child's Play 2 (1990) because the original body of Chucky was just dismembered and was cleaned off and reassembled. But to be first, missing a head, being melted down entirely and then remade? As much as the first resurrection was preposterous, the idea worked. Here, it just felt like a quick way to get Chucky back up. It's not like fans wouldn't want him back but a better method of rebirth would've been appreciated.Once up and running again, the lakeshore strangler immediately finds out where Andy Barclay is, but his plans abruptly change gears. Before he finds Andy, Chucky meets a new youngster named Tyler (who's also friends with Andy). There he decides that Tyler will be his new host. The new Andy is played by Justin Whalin, who later played Jimmy Olsen in the TV series, Lois and Clark. Whalin plays Andy as a sixteen-year-old, now in military school. Well that was a quick jump in time. One year passes between films and more than half a decade whizzes by our main protagonist. Whalin looks like he could be the older version of actor Alex Vincent (who originally played Andy) so that works. But what happened to Kyle from the last film? Much of the continuity is faithful to its predeceasing stories but the small things should be paid attention to as well. Instead of Kyle, Andy befriends another girl named De Silva (Perrey Reeves), there they form a friendly relationship in a tough school. The depiction of military school isn't as accurate as one would think here. Yes, there are drills and loud commands spouted out from superior officers but as a whole, it doesn't feel as intense as it could be. Nevertheless, Andy is the only character who believes Chucky still lives. Meanwhile, he's bullied by his superiors and fellow soldiers. No surprise there, nobody wants to be friends with Andy. It's sad, but at least this is the final film involving Chucky going after Barclay.Its not needed to be said but Brad Dourif of course entertains as Chucky. His dialog is still funny and you can't help but enjoy his performance as the angry doll that can't cut a break with finding a body to inhabit. More interesting is seeing actor Andrew Robinson from Clive Barker's Hellraiser (1987) have a small role as a barber to the school. His performance isn't memorable but is comical because as a barber to a military school, his obsession with keeping short hair goes beyond normalcy. He's just crazy about keeping short hair, a little too often. For gore, the violence feels in the middle to that of the first two movies. Nothing goes all out ugly like it did in Child's Play 2 (1990), but it's also not as tame as the violence in Child's Play (1988). Either way, it's intriguing to see what twisted methods Chucky has in store this time. The cinematography is mostly competent by John R. Leonetti. What he captures on screen isn't anything beautiful but there are times where the landscape is big which helps it feel like the place Andy is in, isn't a small school. Leonetti would go on to provide camera work for many Dead Silence (2007), The Mask (1994) and The Conjuring (2013). As for music, John D'Andrea and Cory Lerios score is a mixed bag. Instead of Graeme Revells more robust orchestral score from Child's Play 2 (1990), these TV composers revert back to Synthetic tones like that of Joe Renzetti's from the original composition of Child's Play (1988). Yet, without a main theme, this duo at least kept the music sounding creepy. It's hard to say. It's obvious that this production was rushed with its plot being dragged out on the same character but at least its tone didn't change.Its plot is recycled again and its justification for certain events are totally ignored but the main grab is to see how Andy and Chucky duke it out for the final time. It could've been written much worse by comparison.

The new Andy is played by Justin Whalin, who later played Jimmy Olsen in the TV series, Lois and Clark. Whalin plays Andy as a sixteen-year-old, now in military school. Well that was a quick jump in time. One year passes between films and more than half a decade whizzes by our main protagonist. Whalin looks like he could be the older version of actor Alex Vincent (who originally played Andy) so that works. But what happened to Kyle from the last film? Much of the continuity is faithful to its predeceasing stories but the small things should be paid attention to as well. Instead of Kyle, Andy befriends another girl named De Silva (Perrey Reeves), there they form a friendly relationship in a tough school. The depiction of military school isn't as accurate as one would think here. Yes, there are drills and loud commands spouted out from superior officers but as a whole, it doesn't feel as intense as it could be. Nevertheless, Andy is the only character who believes Chucky still lives. Meanwhile, he's bullied by his superiors and fellow soldiers. No surprise there, nobody wants to be friends with Andy. It's sad, but at least this is the final film involving Chucky going after Barclay.Its not needed to be said but Brad Dourif of course entertains as Chucky. His dialog is still funny and you can't help but enjoy his performance as the angry doll that can't cut a break with finding a body to inhabit. More interesting is seeing actor Andrew Robinson from Clive Barker's Hellraiser (1987) have a small role as a barber to the school. His performance isn't memorable but is comical because as a barber to a military school, his obsession with keeping short hair goes beyond normalcy. He's just crazy about keeping short hair, a little too often. For gore, the violence feels in the middle to that of the first two movies. Nothing goes all out ugly like it did in Child's Play 2 (1990), but it's also not as tame as the violence in Child's Play (1988). Either way, it's intriguing to see what twisted methods Chucky has in store this time. The cinematography is mostly competent by John R. Leonetti. What he captures on screen isn't anything beautiful but there are times where the landscape is big which helps it feel like the place Andy is in, isn't a small school. Leonetti would go on to provide camera work for many Dead Silence (2007), The Mask (1994) and The Conjuring (2013). As for music, John D'Andrea and Cory Lerios score is a mixed bag. Instead of Graeme Revells more robust orchestral score from Child's Play 2 (1990), these TV composers revert back to Synthetic tones like that of Joe Renzetti's from the original composition of Child's Play (1988). Yet, without a main theme, this duo at least kept the music sounding creepy. It's hard to say. It's obvious that this production was rushed with its plot being dragged out on the same character but at least its tone didn't change.Its plot is recycled again and its justification for certain events are totally ignored but the main grab is to see how Andy and Chucky duke it out for the final time. It could've been written much worse by comparison.

The movie is set in a black and white motif except for a few scenes. The different lighting and shadowing with depth shots make this movie as if seeing it in first person. Oskar Schindler played by Liam Neeson, lives in Czechoslovakia and relocates to Poland after Poland was defeated by Germany within two weeks to become wealthy from the war Schindler is a war profiteer Schindler does not know any Germans in Poland to start an industry; however, Schindler knows of an enamel factory there in which to start his business. Upon arrival into Poland, Schindler works his way into the Germans minds and hearts by becoming well known during a dinner out in the town and buying dinner and drinks. Tango music is played as background music for the affect of Schindler and the Germans entwining a partnership to allow Schindler to open a factory. Schindler has his picture taken with the German elitist and his name becomes a city known name among the Germans. Schindler seeks out Stern a Judenrat and former accountant to open the factory making mess kits with a German army contract. Schindler wants to be known for doing something extraordinary and that no one else had done. Schindler begins seeing from afar the liquidation of the Jews in the Ghetto, and casts his eyes on a little girl wearing a red coat. While this child is being overlooked she escapes the lines and hides under a bed. Schindler cries for her suffrage and he begins seeing human faces and the pain the Jews are enduring. Schindler becomes well-known with Goeth a ruthless German played by Ralph Fiennes. Schindler realizes each Jew did hold a life, were a human being and belonged in a family. Schindler is arrested and Goeth speaks on Schindler's behalf and gets him out of jail, Schindler sees the ashes from Jewish bodies burning, the audience hears in the background a Billie Holiday tune, God Bless the Child. As Schindler watches Goeth with his barbaric treatment, Schindler suggests to Goeth the story of an emperor and granting mercy which Goeth used sporadically as he was an ego maniac. With the war coming to an end, Schindler decides to work out a plan to re-locate his factory and buy from Goeth Jews, and creates his list of names of over 1100.

It's the only I've ever paid twice to go see in theaters. Russell Crowe won an Oscar for his role as Maximus general of the northern Armies. Looking at the movie we see Russell Crowe portray the life of a Roman General who conquered and fought in Britania. There was no other greater honor than to win victories for your emperor who you served. The story goes from a General who had one of the most powerful armies on earth, to a slave turned gladiator who fights in a ring worth no more than the beasts in cages next to him. The betrayal of Maximus by Commodus leads us into a journey filled with danger, revenge, and love, the love of Maximus's family. Through a turn of events Maximus learns the trade of being a gladiator and wins the hearts of the crowd. Through vicious play and versatility in the ring he eventually goes to Rome where he plots his move on killing the emperor Commodus. The movie is filled with action, death, The theme of the movie is revenge and power. Straight out of the gate there is a huge power struggle between the Romans and barbarians of Britania. Power that at that point was slowly slipping away from the indigenous tribes. Commodus learned from his father that Maximus would become the new leader of Rome and give back the power to the Senate. After Maximus was betrayed and his family murdered he was found and sold by slavers to a man who was once a gladiator himself. Finding fame in the arena he eventually found himself to Rome. He plotted his revenge against Commodus and eventually faced him in the ring one on one. The final scene shows Maximus kill the Emperor with cut scenes of him going into the afterlife to meet his wife and son. This eventually leads to his death. To me sounds contributed the most to the theme of the movie. Most of the revenge scenes were in the arena where the clanging of swords and slicing of flesh showed well. During the first scenes with the barbarians chanting and sounds of war added a different element to the movie. This movie was a smash hit. It won 5 Oscars and was nominated for 7 more. With a budget being around 100 million to film and produce the movie would gross around 450 million worldwide. This would be Russell Crowes only Oscar win in a very illustrious career as a movie star.

It all comes about after Kevin suggests they make a pact - a pact that they'll all get laid by prom. After the infamous inspiring speech, in which Kevin finishes with We will get laid...., things start to get even funnier. Jim ends up making a complete fool of himself. Jim installs a webcam and a very beautiful foreign exchange student called Nadia asks if she can get some help with her studies; Jim, worried what to say, looks to both Oz and Kevin and they're like Yes!

Jim gets interrupted whilst he's on webcam as Nadia comes in, therefore leaving it on without realisation.

Hidden amongst her seemingly naïve ramblings are clues as to why she tags along with Kit and to some degree what motivates Kit.

As I have said, I have taught many students who were on the knife-edge as teenagers and, without being too immodest, helped them find purpose. If you don't provide a human being with a purpose, they will surely find alternatives &#x96; and some of them may involve crime and violence.

Why? Badlands answers this question with a hollow inconclusiveness that leaves us with a sense of impotence and despair in the face of seemingly unmotivated violence. It would be easy to get angry with Kit and Holly but it will do no good. They are beyond our anger and outside our standards of behavior. And everyone is looking for answers &#x96; even Holly. Hidden amongst her seemingly naïve ramblings are clues as to why she tags along with Kit and to some degree what motivates Kit. I don't think that there is a better description of feeling abandoned and without purpose than Holly's when she says she felt like she was left sitting in the bath after the water is gone. Hasn't every teenager felt this feeling at one stage or another? I have taught so many girls like Holly who get pregnant to boys like Kit just because it gives them a mission. I have taught boys like Kit who don't go out on killing sprees but do finish in jail because crime and punishment fills the void. No, I am not a bleeding heart. In fact the opposite, because I know that you find sympathy in the dictionary between shit and suicide. Kit and Holly become a temporary world unto themselves and vainly try to build worlds in which they can live. They aren't so different from most children in that respect.

That's not too surprising -- it was a box office flop, is rather rough around the edges, and was part of the tail end of a bunch of 90s indy romcoms that everyone would like to forget. But I think Human Nature is definitely worth revisiting, especially given the slim odds of a new Kaufman film any time soon.Like Kaufman's other films, Human Nature grapples with the artificiality and all-encompassing anxiety of everyday life. Lila and Nathan are consumed with the attempt to deny their animal nature, which in effect means denying their own bodies. But despite their hours of etiquette training and electrolysis, animality keeps bursting out. The return to the wild and the acknowledgement of the animal appears for a time as a way to escape the postmodern anxiety that Kaufman constantly grapples with. But in the end, this is too easy a solution, and primitivism becomes another mediated narrative and ultimately a postmodern joke. But the escape to the wild was fun while it lasted -- and maybe, just maybe, there's something genuinely positive there.Beyond the philosophical point, it's also funny movie that doesn't overstay its welcome. While thoroughly enjoyable, Human Nature doesn't take it easy on the audience, despite being in a genre associated with crowd-pleasing. All of the three central characters alternate between being sympathetic and repulsive, and if there's a romance we're supposed to be rooting for, it becomes very unclear by the end.Kaufman's script is as good as ever, but many of the surrounding elements are pedestrian. Michel Gondry shows no sign of his usual visual flair or directorial ambition. Rhys Ilfan is good in a role that mixes endearing dorkishness with serial-killer menace, but other than him and a brief appearance by Peter Dinklage the performances are unremarkable and quickly forgotten. None of the visual or performative elements are exactly bad, but they lack the kind of inventiveness that would have made this film truly shine. Human Nature would have benefited from a Wes Anderson or a Rian Johnson at the helm.Human Nature probably deserves its status as Kaufman\/Gondry minora, but it's still well worth watching. Like most good art, it raises more questions than it answers, leaving the audience to find a way to reconcile the demands of nature and culture. If this is the worst movie you make, you're doing something right.

None of the visual or performative elements are exactly bad, but they lack the kind of inventiveness that would have made this film truly shine. Human Nature would have benefited from a Wes Anderson or a Rian Johnson at the helm.Human Nature probably deserves its status as Kaufman\/Gondry minora, but it's still well worth watching. Like most good art, it raises more questions than it answers, leaving the audience to find a way to reconcile the demands of nature and culture. If this is the worst movie you make, you're doing something right.

I wanted to see it again mainly because it is fun to see where it is filmed, many places I am familiar with. In fact the final chase scene, supposedly in Washington D.C. and ending up in a FBI building is actually the underground parking area under One Shell Plaza in Houston, the same building I worked in for a number of years right before this was filmed. The movie is set in the areas surrounding D.C. but except for a few location shots was filmed in Houston and surrounding neighborhoods.Anyway, to the movie, a pretty interesting terrorist thriller. Jeff Bridges is professor Michael Faraday. Not many years earlier his wife, an FBI agent, had been killed in a botched raid. This heightened his interest in terrorist subjects in general. When he finds a young boy wandering down the middle of the street in his neighborhood, bleeding, he scoops him up and takes him to the hospital. That gets him to become friends with the boy's parents, neighbors he had not yet met.Those neighbors are Tim Robbins as Oliver Lang and his wife is Joan Cusack as Cheryl Lang. They seem nice enough but Michael's paranoia gets him suspicious of blueprints he finds in the Lang home, and he begins his own investigation into who these people really are.It isn't a great movie but a pretty entertaining one, Robbins and Bridges are good in their roles, as well as Cusack.SPOILERS Michael soon finds that Oliver Lang was not his original name, but a name he took as a young adult after the childhood friend of that name was killed. Michael digs and finds that he had been convicted of crimes as a teenager and now suspected he was planning to blow up an FBI building in a terrorist plot. In the end when it appears that Michael might have thwarted the plot, he in fact became an unwitting part of it. The car he was driving actually had the bomb, and in the parking garage in the basement of the building exploded killing him and many others in the building.

Lets start with the kids, for one Cathy and Chris are Way.... Older in the movie then the novel, and I found that to be a big disappointment because they start out so innocent in the Attic that after three and a half years, their innocence has been shattered to pieces. Plus Kristy Swanson and Jeb Stuart Adams were not at all how I pictured Cathy and Chris, don't know why that were chosen. And the grandmother! She is so evil, and I just do not like it one bit. In the novel it practically stated that she is evil, but there is a sense of humanity in her. Which the movie completely leaves out and just makes her so you wish her dead every minute. Changing the poison doughnuts to poison cookies was just ridiculous! Them changing the time in the Attic to one year instead of three I found unnecessary. The ending was the second biggest hit to the gut, because instead of just leaving they accidentally kill there mother, leaving absolutely no possibility for a sequel! They just screwed themselves over with that decision. And the last thing is they leave out the incest. I'm not stating that I enjoyed the incest cause I did not. I am stating that it was a huge part of the novel, which is what shocked and captured millions of people and when they take that out... The film is hollow. No passion. I find it to destroy the whole film all together. I am very disappointed by this adaption and give this a 1 out of 10, I do not recommend this movie.
