[{"date":"8 December 2009","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy were the two greatest comedy stars of the decade. Unfortunately, that decade was the 1980s and this was the late 1990s. Bowfinger disappoints more than it amuses.Martin is Bobby Bowfinger, luckless wannabe movie director who comes up with a desperate scheme to break into the big time Surreptitiously shoot action star Kit Ramsey (Murphy) so Bowfinger can feature him in a film about attacking aliens. Bowfinger thus will have Ramsey's services and marquee name without having to go through the trouble of signing or paying him.I get the feeling the inspiration for writing this movie came to Martin right after he saw Ed Wood. So much of Tim Burton's classic serio-comic celebration of the courage of believing in yourself no matter how bad you are winds up in this film it's almost a remake. Martin has fun satirizing Hollywood culture, not new territory for him or anyone else, but the digs at mindless cults and celebrity lesbians come off labored and thin.The film does start well. We watch Bowfinger carrying on a conversation with a disconnected car phone, trying to impress Robert Downey Jr. playing a slick producer. (Downey is typically brilliant here but badly underused). Meanwhile, Ramsey is counseled on his rampant paranoia by his handlers at Mind Head, the Scientology-like organization Kit belongs to. Even though I feel like I might ignite...I probably won't is his self-help mantra.Murphy is on fire, both as Kit and especially Jiff, a nerd Bowfinger hires as a stand-in when Kit is taken out of circulation for a while. Jiff is one of Murphy's sweetest and funniest characters, a gawky, brace-wearing guy whose idea of complete happiness is running coffee errands and being liked for himself. Asked about his show-business career, Jiff explains he is an active renter of Blockbuster. Will he drop his pants on camera? Jiff breaks into a surprised, embarrassed grin that's one of Murphy's best-ever moments on screen.Jiff is the one plus in the film's second half, which otherwise crumbles into a dopey and contrived farce, pushing Kit really thinking he is under alien attack while Bowfinger gets his footage. As Krumski put it in a 2000 review, it's not the contrivance that's wrong, but that the comedy is so tonally off you can't help but notice it.Maybe if Martin found better actors to beef up his supporting cast. Heather Graham is a bad actress playing a bad actress. I'm not a Christine Baranski fan, either, but she may be the victim of a script that gives her little to do. No one else even registers, not even Bowfinger's dog, and I'm a pretty easy audience for dogs.The worst performer here, it pains me to say, is Martin himself. He waves his hands around antically and plays his part too broadly, straining to sell every one of his lines as comedy gold. They aren't, like when he tells a young actor about the mystical quality called it.It's a special quality. No matter what's going on, you can't take your eye off that person.Do I have it? asks the youth.I'm sorry, I wasn't listening, what?Director Frank Oz teamed with Martin three times before with good results so it's a surprise to see this misfire. Also a shame, given Murphy doesn't collaborate with equal partners often, and brought so much to the table here. Bowfinger entertains in parts, but leaves you wishing and knowing it could have been more.
