[{"date":"15 September 2001","score":"21 out of 25 people found the following review useful","review":"  The ambiguity of youth and the road to maturity are addressed in a somewhat stoically humorous manner by the Farrelly Brothers in the comedy, `Outside Providence,' directed by Michael Corrente.  Set in New England in 1974, the story centers on Tim Dunphy (Shawn Hatosy), an irresponsible seventeen-year-old who since the untimely death of his mother has lived with his gruff, blue-collar father (Alec Baldwin), his crippled younger brother, Jackie (Tommy Bone) and a one-eyed, three-legged dog.  Life is less than idyllic for Tim, but it doesn't seem to make much difference as long as he can live in the moment and get high with his friends.  In that respect, in fact, life is pretty good.  Tim's a senior in high school with nary a care in the world, until a car accident involving drugs and alcohol lands him in big trouble, and he avoids incarceration only by the grace and intervention of one of his father's `connected' cronies.  Instead of jail time he is sent away to the prestigious prep school, Cornhill, whereupon graduation his offense will be expunged from his record.  All he has to do is toe the line and get through his senior year.  But that senior year can last a long time, especially after he meets Jane Weston (Amy Smart), the girl of his (and everybody else's) dreams.  So what is a lad to do, knuckle down, follow the rules and put his life in order-- or follow his heart?  Or, as Tim replies when a teacher asks him to name his favorite author, `Hamlet.'  To be, or not to be.  And that is the question.While not terribly original by any means, Corrente's film (which he co-wrote with Bobby and Peter Farrelly, adapted from the novel by Peter Farrelly) is funny and well presented, and has that quirky, recognizable Farrelly Brother's touch.  There's even a poignant moment or two, and most importantly, this isn't a `silly' movie, and though the characters are fairly stereotypical, Corrente manages to give it something of a fresh face and allows the humor to evolve naturally, never fishing for laughs or manipulating the situations purely for the sake of hilarity.  And it works well; there are some genuinely funny scenes, some side-splitting lines and one signature Farrelly Brothers scene that involves a flashback of the traumatic `hazing' of a freshman named Irving (Jack Ferver).Shawn Hatosy gives a believable performance as Tim, and though he's not overly charismatic or likable, he does create a character with whom many peers and parents will be able to relate.  Tim is a very real person feeling his way through a very precarious period of his life.  And beyond the humorous aspects of the film, there is actually some very credible character development evident in Tim's behavior, and in the final analysis the overall picture not only aspires to a higher level because of it, but succeeds in that regard.  Hatosy's Tim is very much the average kid who lives in your neighborhood and works at the local fast food joint while he figuring out what life is all about.  Without anything singular or remarkable about him, he is entirely true-to-life and honest.As `Old Man Dunphy,' Baldwin gives a solid performance, and with limited screen time manages to establish his character with astute precision. Like Tim, Baldwin's character is real, and serves as a kind of core for the story, and that realism of the characters is one of the strengths of the film.  The `Old Man' maintains a gruff exterior-- a bravura by which to live, if you will-- but you get a sense that there is something deeper to him, while at the same time you realize that what you see is very much a true perspective of who he really is as well.  It's a matter of Baldwin's ability as an actor enabling him to infuse some complexity into a character that could easily have been one dimensional in less capable hands.The supporting cast includes Jon Abrahams (Drugs Delaney), Richard Jenkins (Barney), George Wendt (Joey), Adam LaVorgna (Tommy the Wire), Timothy Crowe (Mr. Funderbeck), George Martin (Dean Mort), Gabriel Mann (Jack) and Kristen Shorten (Bunny Cote).  In a market veritably saturated for some time with comedies about teen angst (most of which are silly, insignificant, devoid of real humor and not worth the film they're printed on), with `Outside Providence,' Corrente and the Farrelly Brothers have to be given credit for delivering one that is truly funny while at the same time anchored in reality.  There is, in fact, more here than meets the eye upon the initial viewing.  Not only does it capture the essence of the era in which it takes place, but a sense of reality that in the end is definitive of it, as well. And it's done with humor, and without taking it over the edge, as the Farrelly Brothers are often wont to do.  Ultimately, it's a satisfying experience, and it's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 7\/10.

I'm always interested to see how Shakespeare can be modernized. Sometimes it works(10 Things I Hate About You=The Taming of the Shrew and 96 version of Romeo and Juliet)While others aren't so great(Get Over It=A Midsummers Nights Dream). In both cases it's still really exciting to see how they bring the essence of shakespeare to the screen. In my opinion when you modernize the language, the setting, and the characters it presents more of a challenge to make it truly work.So when i heard more about O and its cast i knew i just had to see this movie. I heard about its release date and i was all ready to go see it. However, due to the tragedy at Columbine the films release date was changed due to controversial themes in the movie that related too closely to the tragedy. This peaked my interest in the film even more because i love to see films with strong subject matter because it shows that the filmmaker wnats to hold nothing back and films that are more realistic in that aspect always work better for me.However Miramax could never give O a solid release date. It would be set for release and changed and so on and so forth. In the end O received about 7 different release dates. Finally a studio named Lions Gate picked the film up and gave it a Aug.31, 2001 release date. A whole 2 years after the initial release date. Now it was my time to see it and i'm happy to say i was not disappointed.This update is by far the best modernized retelling of shakespeare ever made. It stayed true to the essence of othello while adding a few little modern twist to the story. To update it for highschool certain things had to be changed for it to fit with story. First there are name changes Othello is now Odin James(O.J., did anyone else get that), Desimonda is now Desi and Iago is now Hugo. Also instead of being a member in high society, O is the msot popular person at his school(The only black student) and a star basketball player. He's dating the most popular girl in school and all these things are what fuel Hugo's jealously. Soon he slowy begins to manipulate all involved in the story untill his plans lead to a pretty tragic conclusion.What i like about the play and this version or lets jsut say this story in general is the way certain things are presented. Everyone has been jealous of someone at some point in there lives so in that aspect you can relate with the villian of the story. I did at some points. Now, don't get me wrong this guy is pretty ruthless but when you look at how he's treated by his dad, who is also his basketball coach, you begin to see what fuels his rage. He's frustrated because he feels he has a right to shine. There are several references to the Hawk in the film. Odin is a hawk because he soars above everyone else and everyone pays attention to him. He's not like everyone else thus he can't fit in with normal birds. Hugo wants to be like this an d he feels that it's his due time to soar above everyone else. I also like how it shows how easily people can be manipulated. Manipulation can truly twist someone's mind up and in this case it truly does.There are many scenes int he film that i felt worked very well in the film and these scenes stand out in my mind as the best in the film. The first one is the slam dunk contest. I coul honestly feel his rage at that point and the instrumental score in that scence was truly magnificent. The next scene is the first confrontation between desi and Odin over the scarf he gave her. the performers are so intense during this scene that it just really pulled me in. Lastly is the last 15 or 20 minutes are truly intense. The things that take place during this time frame really got to me and that's how i knew i was seeing a  good movie. It gave me that feeling in my stomach and the realism that the last 15 minutes or so presents is gripping.The ActingBy far the best aspect of this film is the acting by all involved. Every performer gives a compelling performance.Mekhi Phifer(Odin) he gives a powerful performance. He really captured all the various modes of the character. He played the sensitivity and exuberrance of the character well in the beginning of the film but when the rage and frustration of Odin begins to show this is when Mekhi is in top form. A blistering performance that could very well be the best of his career.Julia Stiles(Desi) Julia Stiles is officially the spokeswoman for william shakespeare. This i her third shakespeare update after 10 things I hate about you and Hamlet. Once again she's proving that she is one of th best actresses of her generation. She conveys the strength but also the innocence of Desi really well. She's a very capable performer and her chemistry with Mekhi Phifer is what makes certain events in the film work.Josh Hartnet(Hugo) I'm a sucker for peopel that paly villains. it jsut seems like an awesome role to play because it cna truly show your range as an actor and Josh hartnet does an admirable job. Nto only through his lines but his manuerisms. He's truly menancing in some scenes but he also has to make you understand his plight. why he's jealous, and why he does what he does. Josh Hartnett is able to pull us into his world and show us why he's so angry. This is by far the best performance of his career.Andrew Keegan(Michael) I don't understand why he's left out of most of the promotion for this film. his character plays an important role in these proceedings. Nonetheless he plays the role of the impressionable teenager quite well. I hope to see him in more roles like this that challenge his range.Rain Phoenix(Emily) i have nothing to compare her performance to but she is quite good in this film. She hits all the right notes and she is really good in the last few scenes of the film. Hope to see her in more movies.Martin Sheen(Coach Goulding) Martin Sheen gives an intense performance as the basketball coach and father of hugo. Some may think he's a little over the top but since i know coaches like this i think he hits all the right notes.Elden HensonSorry i forgot his characters name but he's also very good in the film. He plays the insecure, nerd role pretty well and his character is also very important in the films proceedings.ConclusionAs you cna see i really enjoyed this film and i encourage everyoen to go see it. This film doesn't encourage violents inf act as a 16 year old boy woh is currently in highschool it showed me that actions like this jsut aren't worth it. i tihnk there is a lesson to be learned while you're viewing this film. just go in with an open mind and i'm sure you'll enjoy it.

I hope to see him in more roles like this that challenge his range.Rain Phoenix(Emily) i have nothing to compare her performance to but she is quite good in this film. She hits all the right notes and she is really good in the last few scenes of the film. Hope to see her in more movies.Martin Sheen(Coach Goulding) Martin Sheen gives an intense performance as the basketball coach and father of hugo. Some may think he's a little over the top but since i know coaches like this i think he hits all the right notes.Elden HensonSorry i forgot his characters name but he's also very good in the film. He plays the insecure, nerd role pretty well and his character is also very important in the films proceedings.ConclusionAs you cna see i really enjoyed this film and i encourage everyoen to go see it. This film doesn't encourage violents inf act as a 16 year old boy woh is currently in highschool it showed me that actions like this jsut aren't worth it. i tihnk there is a lesson to be learned while you're viewing this film. just go in with an open mind and i'm sure you'll enjoy it.

Of course, their rewards (though only implied) are still forthcoming and, while less financial than they'd initially hoped for, they're still pretty dreamy.  Walter will go to be the patron saint of a little Indian village where he will be adored, fed, massaged, and probably end up fatter than Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now.  Curtin is going to deliver the news of Cody's death and hopefully slip right in as his surrogate.  (Apparently Cody's wife rejecting a good, sturdy man isn't even a possibility).

I have recently heard that it will be given a limited release in the states this year, and I sincerely hope that it does. This film could do for Malcolm McDowell's career what Pulp Fiction did for John Travolta. It is the most well drawn character he's been given to interpret since Clockwork Orange and as a result is the finest performance he's given in twenty-five years. This includes his wonderful turns in the Lindsay Anderson trilogy as well as Time After Time, and Royal Flash top calibre work from a performer who has been type cast and overlooked for far too long. The nameless gangster that the title implies narrates the story of his own life from 1968 to present as he rises through the ranks of street tough to crime boss. Paul Bettany (recently of Knight's Tale) portrays the younger McDowell, and must have subsisted on a steady diet of Mal's early work because he has his mannerisms down cold. His more than a passing likeness works very well for the transition between the two periods covered in the film. David Thewliss is wonderful as a dandy but deadly crew boss in swinging London and Saffron Burrows looks very at home in 60's regalia and like everyone in the film, gives a very strong Performance.This is a side of British film making that hasn't been seen in years; it seems more of a contemporary of Performance, Get Carter, and Poor Cow, than of Lock, Stock.., or Snatch (both very good films in their own right).

He attacks Hollywood movies based on the fact that the storylines are unbelievable. Well guess what, this film fits that bill perfectly.  The plot in this movie is so un-swallowable it's ridiculous.I will start with the basic plot itself, Super-CIA-Hired mastermind (Travolta) is going to steal 9+ billion dollars and get away with it, sure the CIA has hired him but every other law enforcement agency in the country is hunting him, no problem though, he has plenty of stunt doubles.  The idea is that if he gets the money to a bunch of offshore bank accounts he'll be away scott free.  I could go on and on about how easy it is to track that kind of money through nameless, untraceable bank accounts but I won't. Ok so you're thinking, That's not SO unbelievable that the movie would really warrant such a harsh judgement.  I agree.Hugh Jackman, whom I think is a wonderfull actor and who played his role in Swordfish very well, was given the role of a computer hacker.  He managed to pull it off with some panache given that the character was extremely badly written.  I realize that the general public does not care that a software worm is written in text format and doesn't involve piecing together any pretty pictures but the depiction of Jackman's character building a worm from just that, in my mind, detracted greatly from the realism of the film. Every scene that involved a computer was highly unrealistic.  Now this could be discounted because, What does the general public know about computers and hacking?  Well considering that most of the North American population interacts with computers every day I would have to give the general public as a whole some due credit for computer knowledge.  For example, a large number of people purchase goods using the internet every day.  Mass distrust in the security of this practice has finally started to fade because we are reassured constantly that sites that use 128bit encryption to handle transactions are virtually uncrackable.  Unless the cracker has access to a hell of super-computer and a lot of time, this is fairly accurate.  Now Jackman's character manages to crack that same kind of encryption on a laptop using nothing but his brain, give me a break.Furthermore, the plot is more see-through than Dom Deluise's bib after an all you can eat buffet dinner at KFC.  There was only one plot twist that anyone couldn't see at least an hour in advance.

It felt disjointed, overly sentimental, and lacked what I hoped it would have. But, after walking out, I thought about it. I thought about each scene, what it could of meant, and what was trying to be said. I came to the conclusion that I had no idea, and that in order for me to know, I had to see the movie again. So I did. And here's what I thought I've never been so enchanted, touched, moved, held spellbound,or engrossed in any movie, I possibly have ever seen. Why the difference? Because A.I. is too complicated of a movie to understand if you only see it once. Period.In my opinion this is a masterpiece, the same way Kubrick's 2001 is a masterpiece. 2001 opened to not so grand reviews (so did A.I.) and it didn't do very good business (as of now, neither has A.I.) But, today, one cannot mention great sci-fi movies without mentioning 2001. I suspect the same fate will go to A.I. Everything made infinite more sense the second time around, and the ending that so many have put into question works on every level.I say this for those who felt confused coming out of this film. See it again; all your questions will be answered.As far as the film goes, Haley Joel Osment does it again with a performance for the record-books.

There may be other things but these appear to be the main ones that reviewers tend to focus and rate a movie on.Thus, taking all these elements together into consideration how does this movie rate? Well, strictly, put it doesn't - neither did the other Jurassic park movies - nor should they - because the movies weren't written or directed to reach a high level of each of those elements. If one element was focused on - its special effects, in bringing dinosaurian to `life'. The movie was created to entertain the audience in order to appease the masses in order to return a reasonable profit margin. The whole focus I think with movies like these is to purely entertain people who want to spend an hour or two away from reality, to use their imagination to transfer themselves into the realm of sci-fi fantasy. I believe that's what Jurassic Park movies are, sci-fi fantasy. Not strictly horror or a monster movie because these so-called `monsters' happen to be based on fact (fossilized bones). The first Jurassic Park movie did very well because it was the first, to put dinosaurs on screen (the most realistic to date), with very state of art special effects. Thus, Its becomes very difficult to pique the same amount of interest in sequels, to do something very different. Its not that the first Jurassic Park was that much superior in storyline, but its storyline is inherently more in-depth because sequels tend to play off an established storyline rather then create a whole new world.If you are person who can get lost in a world of imagination then all three movies a very effective, and all three bring out the main characters of the movies, the dinosaurs. Whether one is better than the other, its matter of personal expectation and perception. For movies like these actors are very important but in-depth characterization need not be. They are not the focus even though they do bring out the storyline. Personally, I liked the third one the best. The reason why is I didn't go into the movie theatre with an expectation to see a flawless storyline. Plus, I made the mistake of reading the books first, and thus, had the expectation of going in expecting an onslaught of scientific facts (which drew me into the book the first place).If you think long and hard enough, all movies that have ever been made has had at least some flaws, gaps of logic, or inaccuracies in them because the movie averages around 1 to 3 hours long, and like a plan or strategy cant possible take into account every possible or scenario or element. Therefore, plot holes are inherent in all movies. Thus, in my opinion criticism regarding plot holes is pretty much redundant.Why did I go see this movie then? Because I'm a movie buff and a dinosaur fan. I just wanted to see somebody's perspective of what they think dinosaurs would be like if they were alive today. Frankly speaking, all three movies have a lot of inaccuracies and wild speculation in regards to dinosauria. And frankly speaking, that's okay, because these are not educational documentaries. And if you want to be educated on things dinosauria then read something from Jack Horner, Robert Bakker, David Norman, Thomas Holtz, or the like.However, having enjoyed the movie and the depiction of dinosaurian, I do have some comments on what I would liked to have seen done more in the movie. It would have been nice if the directors and screenwriters were more accurate with dinosaur facts. Instead taking Hollywood liberties with the facts, they could have taken more liberties with speculation of current dinosaurian paleontology instead.For example in Jurassic Park I velociraptors were far too big (at least twice the size - perhaps more based on the deinonychus) in the account of fossils sizes found with this species, Brachiosaurs did not chew like a cow (their jaw structure would not have allowed those movements); Lost World, stegosauria had their back plates in two parallel rows rather than a line of alternating plates (across two rows), pachycephalosaurus would have had severe head damage banging into that vehicle like that  (its skull is actually shown to be porous and fragile under strain); Jurassic Park III the tyrannosaurus should have made a least some damage to the spinosaurus if not killed it, when it bit into its neck (esp. with the expected power of  its powerful jaws).  I could go on with the inaccuracies, but you get the point.I instead would have liked to see speculation on the connection between birds and dinosaurs (esp. dromaeosaurids) and have seen colourful theropods with feathers on them, and perhaps vast difference between male and female. And maybe shown some species start to evolve into birds.  It would also have been good to see more of the speculated paternal instincts of some dinosaur species like the hadrosauridae or some theoropods (esp. nesting rituals), or the defense strategy of ceratopsians against predators (moving into a circle) If they created a park with flying reptiles like the pteranodons why not also include the sea reptiles like plesiosaurs.But like I said, this isn't made to educate.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"15 September 2001","score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":"  Unlike his fellow Australian George Miller, Bruce Beresford seems absolutely determined to make people forget he used to have a good reputation as a director with his American-mae films - Miller gave us Lorenzo's Oil and Babe (OK, he only produced it, but it counts), Beresford gave us Her Alibi and Double Jeopardy. In fairness, it was written by the team behind The Rock and produced by Aaron Spelling's ex-partner Leonard Goldberg, which would explain a lot.Even without that knowledge, you still have the fact that this is the kind of film that works best if you don't know much going in. Alas, a lot of the preview information did reveal enough to give you a basic idea - Ashley Judd, the Jeff Bridges to Wynonna's Beau (that is, as one UK critic said the talented, slim and attractive one), is convicted for murdering her hubby on circumstantial evidence, finds out that he's alive, is told by a fellow inmate and disbarred lawyer that she can find him, kill him and escape scott-free under the concept of double jeopardy (I'm no expert on the American legal system, but I'm sure it can't be that simple. And as another person here noted, taking legal advice from a convicted murderer isn't a good idea), and eventually gets out of prison on parole with the goal of finding her husband and getting her beloved son back. That means that the rest of the film is a bit predictable, but it doesn't mean that Miss Judd, unlike the ever-professional Tommy Lee Jones, has to let her obvious (though not unreasonable) disdain for the script shine through a bit too often; nor does it has to be increasingly ludicrous (sample plothole how does a parole violator manage to get from Washington State to New Orleans so easily?). Another problem for British viewers is the name of Bruce Greenwood's character - it's hard for Brits to take seriously a thriller where the heavy is called Nicholas Parsons (though in fairness, I wouldn't expect Americans to know he shares his name with a veteran UK game-show host).

Get it at Amazon.)This is a tale about the ancien régime in 18th century France before the revolution in which the moral decadence of the privileged classes rivaled that of Sodom and Gomorrah and the ancient Romans. The story comes from a novel by Choderlos de Laclos that was made into a stage play by Christopher Hampton. It is a cynical satire on human sexuality as well as a very subtle examination of sexual hypocrisy and desire, a kind of oh so sophisticated laugh at bourgeois morality that would have delighted Voltaire and Moliere and greatly amused Shakespeare. It is a tale of elaborate lechery and revenge that backfires because it seems that anybody, even the most jagged rake can fall in love, and thereby become the victim.John Malkovich plays the rake, Vicomte de Valmont, whose sole purpose in life is to seduce women, rob them of their virtue and then move on. Glenn Close plays his back-stabbing confidante and one-time lover, the Marquise de Merteuil. Michelle Pfeiffer plays the coy and virtuous Madame de Tourvel, who is to be Valmont's latest conquest. Uma Thurman is cast as a teenaged ingenue who is betrothed to Merteuil's lover while Keanu Reeves plays her naive music teacher and would be lover, Chevalier Danceny. Stephen Frears, who has directed such diverse films as The Grifters (1990) and My Beautiful Laundrette (1985), after a somewhat cryptic start, does an excellent job of bringing the biting cynicism of Laclos and Hampton to the screen.I know of two other versions of this film, Milos Forman's Valmont (1989), starring Colin Firth and Annette Bening, and Roger Vadim's Dangerous Liaisons (1960). Regrettably , I haven't seen Vadim's film, but Forman's Valmont is excellent. In polite society comparisons are said to be odious. I shall proceed anywayJohn Malkovich vs. Colin Firth. Malkovich is widely recognized as a great actor, but he is clearly miscast in this role, yet he brings a predatory dimension to the part that is in keeping with the overall psychology of the movie. Firth, while not as celebrated for his acting skills as Malkovich, is nonetheless a fine actor, and his charm and playful inventiveness are more in keeping with the character of Valmont, whom women love. Call it even.Glenn Close vs. Annette Bening. Again Close is considered the more accomplished actor, but Bening is sexier, prettier and considerably more charming. Whether that is a plus as far as the reality of the novel and play are concerned is debatable. For my part I found Bening a lot more fun to watch. Edge to Bening.Michelle Pfeiffer vs. Meg Tilly. Pfeiffer is a much bigger star and has more experience as an actress. She is beautiful, but Tilly is more passionate. Pfeiffer was nominated for an academy award for best supporting actress for her work, but did not win. Personally I thought Tilly was more believable and was especially effective in projecting first the repressed passion and then the complete abandonment as she gives herself to Valmont. Pfeiffer's portrayal of Tourvel's coy awakening, with just a hint of duplicity, and then her utter dissolution when he leaves her, was star quality. Edge to Pfeiffer.Uma Thurman vs. Fairuza Balk. I loved them both. Thurman, of course, is a more statuesque beauty with a polished and controlled acting style, but Balk's wide-eyed innocence was a delight. Call it even.Keanu Reeves vs. Henry Thomas. Thomas was cute, but almost too juvenile to be believed. Reeves seemed just right for the part. Clear edge to Reeves.Frears vs. Forman. Frears's direction was more cynical, especially in the duel between Valmont and Merteuil in which their mutual and complementary debauchery is in sharp focus. And his resolution was more clearly defined. Forman's strength was in the delight and playfulness of many of the scenes, especially those relating to the seduction of Tourvel. His direction was more comedic and he allowed a greater development of secondary characters, while Frears concentrated more on the two leads. I give a very small edge to Forman, but would not argue with those preferring Frears.Bottom line I liked Forman's movie better, but the voters at IMDb.com preferred Frears's Dangerous Liaisons, giving it an average of 7.7 stars out of ten to 6.7 for Valmont.

The Chilean born director is not yet thirty, and people are already comparing his style with all kinds of film-makers, from Orson Welles to Alfred Hitchcock.There is no doubt that Amenábar is a gifted young man and he will go a long way in the cinema world - which usually means ending up in Hollywood, and that will be that, I suppose. The Almodóvars and Amenábars, together with such delightful beings like the aforementioned Ms Cruz, Javier Bardem and Antonio Banderas, figure among Spain's principal exports in recent years.In 'Abre los Ojos' Amenábar falls back on Eduardo Noriega who had starred in his earlier film 'Tesis' (1996), this time pairing up the 'beautiful boy' with the astounding epitome of Spanish loveliness, Penelope Cruz. However Noriega's beautiful features have to be destroyed for this film, caused by a car accident as a result of unbounded jealousies by his would-be lover Najwa Nimri. From there Amenábar launches into a phantasmagorical mix of thriller-mystery verging even on science fiction, in which real life becomes intermeshed with programmed dream-life. Hardly venturing into surrealist dimensions, Amenábar maneuvers through hypothetical life-hereafter in uncannily bewildering scene-shifts that in the end, or rather as some kind of undefinable outcome, leave the story-line in a patently obscure set of parenthesis.

The dog dies too, as does the typical patriotic family trying to be heroic and defend their home. What a complete hoot this film is. How it ever got made, I will never know. It wasn't likely to be a success because it wasn't a typically patriotic blockbuster, it was expensive, and in the end it wasn't a success. It was a terrible flop, which illustrates that Americans really will never be able to laugh at themselves. It's hard to believe that Tim Burton is an american at all. This is one of the most unusual films you'll ever see. It has sophisticated humor and an all-star cast. That's a pretty rare combination. Miss at your own peril...
