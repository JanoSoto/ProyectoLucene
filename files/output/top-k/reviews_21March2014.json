This film is a heartfelt film that is pure magic and one for the entire family to enjoy. It has some beautiful, magical songs such as the much-heralded Under the Sea. The animation is light and actually pretty clear for an 80's animation film. This film is going to be impossible to resist and is one of the better Disney animated films ever made.Based of the fairytale by Hans Christensen Anderson, Ron Clements film is about how a mermaid named Ariel makes a pact with the evil sea witch, Ursula to become human and she has three days to kiss her true love or else she will turn back into a mermaid and endure being her servant for eternity.This film really has no famous voice-cast but I truly must single out Jodi Benson for her exceptional voice work. This is her first big voice role and she hits it spot on. She truly has a voice and proves it singing all these magical songs.Overall, this is a classic Disney film that harks back to the olden days of Disney. This begins the classics that were spawned out in the 1990's. A film of pure magic and a family delight. It's funny, romantic, and more emotional than one would expect. A very good film indeed.

This was returned to me by my teacher with the comment in red ink Making love does not mean this! If you mean having sexual intercourse, why not say so! I was baffled until my father explained that to the older generation (and my teacher must have been born around 1910) the phrase to make love meant simply to kiss, cuddle and whisper sweet nothings. It did not mean to have sex. Which explains why it was, as late as 1960, possible to make a film called Let's Make Love without it being banned by the censor as pornographic. (It also explains why Doris Day could include the line Make love to me! in the song Move Over, Darling without losing her good girl reputation). The film stars Marilyn Monroe and essentially inverts the plot of one of her earlier films, How to Marry a Millionaire. In that film Marilyn plays a gold-digger whose ambition is to marry a wealthy man but who ends up marrying for love. In Let's Make Love her character, Amanda Dell, is a free-thinking idealist who despises the idea of marrying for money but who ends up with a billionaire. There are also similarities to the plot of The French Line, which starred Marilyn's close friend Jane Russell, although in that film the sex roles are reversed; it is the woman who wants a man who will love her for herself, not her money, and therefore keeps her wealth a secret. In both films the man is French and the woman American. In the original script the billionaire was to have been an American and several actors, from Gary Cooper to Charlton Heston, were canvassed for the part. Gregory Peck was cast at one time, but later dropped out. Eventually the film-makers decided to make him a Frenchman, Jean-Marc Clement, and Yves Montand was chosen to play the role. (Cyd Charisse was originally slated to play Amanda before Monroe was cast). The plot involves Clement learning that he is to be satirised in an off- Broadway revue and going along to the theatre to find out more. By a misunderstanding, the director assumes that he is an actor who has come to audition for a part, and Clement ends up playing himself in the revue. He does not, however, enlighten anyone as to his true identity, as he has fallen in love with Amanda, a beautiful young actress appearing in the same show. Because he wants to be loved for himself and not for his money, and because he quickly realises that Amanda is not interested in wealth, he decides to woo her under an assumed name. This was to be Marilyn's penultimate film before her death. (Her last was to be The Misfits). She did not have a high opinion of it, having only accepted the role in order to fulfil a contractual obligation to 20th Century Fox, and described it as the worst in her career. Her husband Arthur Miller was similarly critical, even though he had contributed towards the script. Certainly, it has its weaknesses. Montand was capable of projecting great charm and personality, but he was not a fluent English speaker and his heavy accent sometimes makes his lines difficult to understand. Yet the film also has its strengths, and some of these lie in the areas where Marilyn and her husband made their contributions. The script is elegant and witty, although I cannot say how much of this is due to Miller and how much to the original scriptwriter Norman Krasna. Moreover, a lot of the success of Let's Make Love is down to Marilyn's performance. She was one of those fortunate few who seemed to get more attractive as she got older (the late Princess Diana was another), and by 1960 the ordinarily pretty girl of the early part of her career had blossomed into a genuinely beautiful woman. Yet she had done so without losing the ability to convey an innocent girl-next-door charm, which in this film is an important part of Amanda's personality. The more sensuous Charisse, a great beauty and a brilliant dancer but a mediocre actress, could never have done that so well. There are also good contributions from Tony Randall and Wilfrid Hyde-White as two of Clement's employees, and Bing Crosby, Gene Kelly and the comedian Milton Berle as themselves. (They are hired by Clement to teach him some of the tricks of showbiz). In its day Let's Make Love possibly seemed rather conservative, a romantic comedy from the sixties which was not too different from the sort of thing Hollywood was doing in the forties or even (apart from the use of colour) in the thirties. This may explain why contemporary reviews were mixed and it was not a great box office success, certainly not when compared to most other films starring Monroe. (Her previous film, Some Like It Hot, for example, had been a smash hit). Over the next decade styles of film-making were to change enormously; by 1965 a film like this would have been deeply unfashionable and by 1970 virtually inconceivable. Yet today I think we can appreciate the film for what it is, a sophisticated and amusing rom-com from a particular era in cinema history. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 March 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" During my schooldays I once wrote an essay on Chaucer in which I stated that the Wife of Bath liked to make love to lots of different men.

I've never seen any other movie that seemed so downright profound.The movie affected me on two levels it's a very touching romance with an ending that is so very sad; I often want to re-write the ending so that these guys can and will stay together. I find it totally believable that Steven and John would fall in love with one another, and I believe it every time they express their love to each other. One of the most romantic, albeit brief, moments is when John invites Steven to come live with me. But the romantic story has such a sad ending; surely there has to be a way for Steven to forgive John for the violence that John inflicted in the locker room, and forgiveness CAN happen if John tells the truth about himself to his parents and friends.That leads me to talk about the other way the movie affects me; the movie conveys, as its implicit moral, how important it is to reveal the truth about yourself to others, to come out. When I saw the movie circa 2001 or so, I found Steven's speech in the assembly hall was utterly inspiring. That speech, and the issues involved in why Steven and John break up, made me decide that I'm going to tell the truth to more people whom I have not previously told the whole truth, that I'm not going to stay closeted from anyone who deserves to know the truth. Indeed, a couple of years after I first saw the movie, I revealed that I'm gay to a room full of straight people, only one of whom already knew it.The tears John is shedding the first night he spends with Steven - the tears that start flowing when he admits to himself that he is gay - are based on two emotions fear and shame. The fear is that he'll lose the love and support of his parents and he'll lose his status as the school's Head Boy. But he's also ashamed of just plain being gay. John asks, through tear-filled eyes, as he looks into Steven's eyes, What's wrong with me? And in an important scene later, when Steven is angry with John for going out on a date with Christina, John confesses (with sadness in his eyes), I guess I went out with Christina tonight because I needed to feel good about myself. The most important reason why Steven and John break up at the end is not that John is afraid of being found out, but because of the contrast between Steven's gay pride and John's gay shame. Steven said (the night of John's date with Christina)I want you to be proud of us, but you're not! You're ashamed to be seen with me! Even though John then promised to talk to Steven and treat him like a friend while they're in school, that is not what Steven meant by be proud of us. John can't take any pride in his love for Steven unless and until John gets over the feeling of shame in just being gay.So that is why I fell in love with this movie it sends profound messages about the meaning of gay pride and in the importance of telling people the truth about yourself. Steven could have spared Jessica some heartache if he had told her, when Jessica gave Steven a kiss, that he's gay, and he would have told her the truth if it weren't for his (implied) promise to John that he was going to keep it a secret. Steven's desire to tell his parents and his classmates the truth about himself started to grow once he and John fell in love. That's when his gay pride began to grow, and it was why he wrote the little essay about what is it like to be a gay teenager.I have only a few complaints about the movie. One is a scene, at about 44 minutes in, that starts with John saying to Steven, Please, help me. I'm worried; I'm confused, and which culminates in a tender kiss. This scene lasted 6 minutes and I think the director\/actors could have trimmed it a little bit, making it 5 minutes instead. That scene has about one minute of monologue by John that seemed unnecessary. And that scene is followed, in terms of when we next see them, by a scene in which Steven says to John You finished all the bacon yesterday, which means that they've spent an entire weekend together - two consecutive nights, and they've had breakfast together two consecutive mornings - but the whole day in between is missing. I would want to hear what Steven and John talk about the first day they spend an entire day together, a day right after John has finally admitted to himself that he's gay. Finally, I'm disappointed that, in the very last scene of the movie, Steven is smiling and joking as he gets into Linda's car and goes for a drive, as if he got over the grief of his breakup with John almost immediately after it happened. He had just been sniffling and fighting back tears a moment before. He got over a major heartache much too quickly.But a few minor quibbles like that are only worth mentioning because I do love the whole movie so much. I even think a lot of people who have moral objections to homosexuality and to the concept of gay pride could be touched by this movie.

And in an important scene later, when Steven is angry with John for going out on a date with Christina, John confesses (with sadness in his eyes), I guess I went out with Christina tonight because I needed to feel good about myself. The most important reason why Steven and John break up at the end is not that John is afraid of being found out, but because of the contrast between Steven's gay pride and John's gay shame. Steven said (the night of John's date with Christina)I want you to be proud of us, but you're not! You're ashamed to be seen with me! Even though John then promised to talk to Steven and treat him like a friend while they're in school, that is not what Steven meant by be proud of us. John can't take any pride in his love for Steven unless and until John gets over the feeling of shame in just being gay.So that is why I fell in love with this movie it sends profound messages about the meaning of gay pride and in the importance of telling people the truth about yourself. Steven could have spared Jessica some heartache if he had told her, when Jessica gave Steven a kiss, that he's gay, and he would have told her the truth if it weren't for his (implied) promise to John that he was going to keep it a secret. Steven's desire to tell his parents and his classmates the truth about himself started to grow once he and John fell in love. That's when his gay pride began to grow, and it was why he wrote the little essay about what is it like to be a gay teenager.I have only a few complaints about the movie. One is a scene, at about 44 minutes in, that starts with John saying to Steven, Please, help me. I'm worried; I'm confused, and which culminates in a tender kiss. This scene lasted 6 minutes and I think the director\/actors could have trimmed it a little bit, making it 5 minutes instead. That scene has about one minute of monologue by John that seemed unnecessary. And that scene is followed, in terms of when we next see them, by a scene in which Steven says to John You finished all the bacon yesterday, which means that they've spent an entire weekend together - two consecutive nights, and they've had breakfast together two consecutive mornings - but the whole day in between is missing. I would want to hear what Steven and John talk about the first day they spend an entire day together, a day right after John has finally admitted to himself that he's gay. Finally, I'm disappointed that, in the very last scene of the movie, Steven is smiling and joking as he gets into Linda's car and goes for a drive, as if he got over the grief of his breakup with John almost immediately after it happened. He had just been sniffling and fighting back tears a moment before. He got over a major heartache much too quickly.But a few minor quibbles like that are only worth mentioning because I do love the whole movie so much. I even think a lot of people who have moral objections to homosexuality and to the concept of gay pride could be touched by this movie.

I've never seen any other movie that seemed so downright profound.The movie affected me on two levels it's a very touching romance with an ending that is so very sad; I often want to re-write the ending so that these guys can and will stay together. I find it totally believable that Steven and John would fall in love with one another, and I believe it every time they express their love to each other. One of the most romantic, albeit brief, moments is when John invites Steven to come live with me. But the romantic story has such a sad ending; surely there has to be a way for Steven to forgive John for the violence that John inflicted in the locker room, and forgiveness CAN happen if John tells the truth about himself to his parents and friends.That leads me to talk about the other way the movie affects me; the movie conveys, as its implicit moral, how important it is to reveal the truth about yourself to others, to come out. When I saw the movie circa 2001 or so, I found Steven's speech in the assembly hall was utterly inspiring. That speech, and the issues involved in why Steven and John break up, made me decide that I'm going to tell the truth to more people whom I have not previously told the whole truth, that I'm not going to stay closeted from anyone who deserves to know the truth. Indeed, a couple of years after I first saw the movie, I revealed that I'm gay to a room full of straight people, only one of whom already knew it.The tears John is shedding the first night he spends with Steven - the tears that start flowing when he admits to himself that he is gay - are based on two emotions fear and shame. The fear is that he'll lose the love and support of his parents and he'll lose his status as the school's Head Boy. But he's also ashamed of just plain being gay. John asks, through tear-filled eyes, as he looks into Steven's eyes, What's wrong with me?

Seeing Scooby, Shaggy, Fred, Daphne and Velma on a live adapted motion picture is a real treat.After the Mystery Inc. gang have gone their separate ways for two years, they each were invited to go to the whimsical resort Spooky Island, run by Mr. Emile Mondavarious (Rowan Atkinson). After they arrive, the discover that the resort affects young visitors in very strange and ghoulish ways, so it is up to Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby to realize they must reunite to solve the mystery.This is an adventurous movie from start to finish, with a predictable, but fun-filled story. Scooby is filmed in CGI, but voiced by Neil Fanning, and Freddy Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Matthew Lillard and Linda Cardellini each did a creative job in portraying Fred, Daphne, Velma and Shaggy, and each matched the original cartoon voices very well, especially Lillard's Shaggy and Cardellini's Velma. Fred and Daphne are my favorite characters in the movie; Prinze and Gellar did great in their roles and it is just interesting seeing them go from portraying characters in teenage comedies, horror\/slasher movies and Buffy the Vampire Slayer to a cartoon-based film.The special and visual effects were colorful and the island resort was a little too flashy, looking like it was ripped out of a comic book. A lot of slapstick comedy and humor gets a little too overboard or cliché, almost too childish at some point. Some movies are meant to be taken seriously and some are meant to just have fun with. Then, there are movies that are so bad and you end up not taking the movie seriously and not having fun with it. Fortunately, I didn't think Scooby-Doo was bad; it is a movie that is great for the entire family and just to enjoy. It is full of adventure and whimsical fun, but still having room to send a message of friendship and teamwork.

This is not, however, a sentimental inspirational teacher film like Goodbye Mr Chips. James Hilton's character was an elderly man looking back happily on his long years of service to the school. Andrew has not reached normal retirement age (he is probably in his fifties) but has been forced by ill-health to retire and take a less arduous, but less well-paid and less prestigious, position teaching English as a foreign language..Moreover, no teacher could be less inspirational than Andrew Crocker- Harris. His less-than-friendly nickname among his pupils is the Croc (as in crocodile- spelled thus in Rattigan's play, but this could also be heard as the Crock, British slang for broken-down old car). A brilliant scholar at Oxford, he entered the teaching profession in the idealistic belief that he had a vocation to inspire his pupils with his own love of classical literature. The intervening years have disillusioned him. He has become humourless and pedantic; his pupils either dislike him or treat him as a figure of fun and regard his lessons as a bore. His attempts to maintain discipline by using sarcastic ridicule have made him even less popular and given him an even less friendly nickname-the Hitler of the Lower Fifth. He is unpopular with his colleagues and patronised by his headmaster. His marriage to a younger woman has broken down, and his wife Laura has been having an adulterous affair with the young American chemistry teacher Frank Hunter.Rattigan's plot - attractive young married woman torn between a dull, unresponsive husband and a charming but faithless lover- is essentially that of a number of literary works, notably Madame Bovary and Anna Karenina, but whereas Flaubert and Tolstoy placed the emphasis on the woman, Rattigan is more concerned with the wronged husband. The crisis comes when Taplow, one of Andrew's pupils, unexpectedly gives him a copy of Robert Browning's translation of Aeschylus's Agamemnon. (Hence the title). Andrew is touched by the gift, but Laura spitefully suggests that the boy gave him the book, not out of kindness or love for Greek literature, but as a bribe to secure promotion to a higher class. (Aeschylus's play is significantly about an unfaithful wife who murders her husband). Rattigan's play was written in 1948 and another film version was made in 1951. Mike Figgis came under some criticism for making this film a contemporary story rather than a forties period piece, but I think he was right. Public schools are very conservative institutions, and there is little which explicitly ties the story to the forties; updating it to the nineties gave more contemporary resonance. There are a few changes to Rattigan's story and some minor details have been changed. Andrew's wife was originally called Millie, not Laura, and his nickname was the Himmler of the Lower Fifth, not Hitler. (Possibly Figgis feared that nineties' audiences would not know who Himmler was). One detail that does not ring true is the selection of the school's games master to play cricket for England. In the forties there were many amateurs playing at the top level in English cricket and the selection of a schoolmaster for England might have been plausible, but not in the nineties. The 1951  Browning Version is regarded by some as a great classic of the British cinema, but I prefer the 1994 film. Anthony Asquith's version is too emotionally reticent, too much stiff-upper-lip and not enough genuine feeling. I also felt that Jean Kent's Millie came across as too cold, hard and spiteful. With Greta Scacchi's Laura one senses, as one does not with Kent, something we are told by Andrew, namely that she is as much to be pitied as he is. She behaves badly towards her husband, but she is a victim, not only of a failed marriage, but also of the way she is treated by Frank, with whom she is deeply in love, even though he does not love her.As for Albert Finney, this is a superb performance. We can always sense that beneath his crusty exterior Andrew is a man of deep feelings, unlike Michael Redgrave who in the early scenes is too much the dry-as- dust pedant to be entirely credible when his more emotional side is revealed later on. Finney is particularly good in the scene (not in Rattigan's play) when he reads extracts from The Agamemnon in the original Greek to his class, no longer Hitler or the Croc but a man inspired by his passion for great literature. He reveals Andrew as a truly tragic hero- a man faced with the simultaneous disintegration of both his career and his marriage, but determined to face the future with stoicism. This film has one or two weaknesses. Matthew Modine as Frank is perhaps the weak link in the acting; I preferred Nigel Patrick in the original. (Frank was not an American in Rattigan's play- doubtless the producers wanted a role for a Hollywood big name). The invented sub-plot involving Taplow and the school bully struck me as unnecessary, These, however, are minor points. Overall, this Browning Version is a deeply moving human drama, one of the best British films of the nineties. 9\/10Some goofs. After the cricket match has finished we are told that Fletcher has scored 112 not out, but during the match itself we see on the scoreboard that he has already scored 123. We see in the school hall the Royal Arms bearing the motto Ich Dien, only used with the three feathers badge of the Prince of Wales. The correct motto for the Royal Arms would be Dieu Et Mon Droit.

We Brits may in recent years have accepted a fully Americanised Halloween, and sometimes even hold our own Fourth of July parties, but we just do not get the concept of Thanksgiving, so Home for the Holidays is frequently shown on British television during the Christmas season. Presumably the TV executives who so schedule it have not actually watched the film; if they had done so they would realise that the word holidays in the title actually refers to Thanksgiving. Claudia Larson is a single mother from Chicago who has just been fired from her job as an art restorer. Her sudden and unexpected loss of her employment, however, does not prevent her from flying to Baltimore to spend Thanksgiving with her parents. On the way she has rather dull conversations with her daughter and with the woman sitting next to her on the plane. When she gets there she has lots of rather dull conversations with her parents and other members of her family. Various arguments break out. Claudia finds a new male admirer. She sneezes a lot. (I think Holly Hunter had a cold). And that's about it.The screenplay was based on a short story by an obscure writer named Chris Radant, and if this film is a fair reflection of the literary merits of his story, then it is perhaps not surprising that Mr Radant has remained in obscurity. This was the second film directed by Jodie Foster (the first was Little Man Tate) and I was certainly surprised that someone of Foster's obvious intelligence and high status in Hollywood couldn't find a more promising literary property to adapt for the screen. Foster has given many great performances as an actress, but as a director she is unable to elicit contributions of a similar quality from her actors, despite the presence in the cast of several big-name stars, including Hunter, Robert Downey Jr., Anne Bancroft and Charles Durning. Too many of the actors mumble their words or speak too softly, making the dialogue difficult to follow. As a result the plot is also difficult to follow; for example I was for a long time under the impression that Claudia's gay brother Tommy's friend Leo was also his partner until it finally emerges that Leo is actually straight and his friendship with Tommy purely platonic. Incidentally, Downey's Tommy comes across the most irritating character in the whole film, which is saying something as there is a lot of competition for that particular title. (His nearest rival is Geraldine Chaplin's eccentric Aunt Glady). This would not have mattered if Tommy was supposed to be irritating, but I was left with the impression that, for all his childish antics, Downey, Foster and the scriptwriter actually wanted us to like him.The main problem with Home for the Holidays is that it's just a dull story about dull people, most of whom (Claudia being an exception) are no more likable than they are interesting. It's the sort of film where the wacky, unconventional characters like Tommy and their Aunt Glady are (beneath that facade of wacky unconventionality) just as boring as the conventional ones like Claudia's strait-laced sister Joanne and Joanne's stuffed-shirt banker husband Walter. Even their arguments are not about matters of any importance, merely endless petty bickering. It seemed like not so much a feature film as an over-extended episode from a soap opera. Given that the film is about Thanksgiving, the word turkey inevitably comes to mind. Perhaps it is not surprising that this turned out to be not only Foster's second film as director but also her last for many years until the recent The Beaver. 4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 March 2014","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" In Britain, Christmas comes but once a year, but this is evidently not enough for our American cousins, who have invented a second Christmas- lite in November, presumably for the benefit of those who just cannot wait another month for the opportunity to go and eat turkey at the homes of their nearest and dearest.

I never understood that then and I still don't really now. For me, this is a very stylish and intriguing film that has many good things about it. Its story centres on a Brooklyn private eye who is hired by a mysterious stranger to find a missing singer who owes him a debt. Everywhere he goes a trail of gruesome ritualistic murders follow. The setting is a very big part of the success of the movie and one of the reasons it has aged so well. 1950's Brooklyn, Harlem, Coney Island and Louisiana are all invoked extremely effectively and give the movie a real sense of place and atmosphere. Likewise, specific settings are well used such as the creepy evangelical church in New York or the backwater bayou in New Orleans. Intensifying the feeling is a really effective, haunting jazz soundtrack. All these things combined make for a very potent mood and atmosphere. Director Alan Parker needs to be given a lot of credit here for this. His direction is excellent and the moments of cinematic style he uses are all, not only extremely well executed, but also really effective in building atmosphere and dread. Sometimes it's totally innocuous details like tap dancing feet that are edited in such a way as to signify impending horror, similarly recurring imagery of lifts, fans and staircases are given a somewhat sinister feeling. Other times, the material is much more direct such as the notorious sex scene or the psychological flash-backs that Harry Angel experiences every so often. While little details like the mysterious nun whose face Harry never quite sees are very well integrated and scary. In other words, stylistically Angel Heart is a real success.All of this would be well and good but what takes it up a level further is the fact that the central mystery is very compelling. It has plenty of noirish detail and characters but is given further value by the way it intermingles this with voodoo and jazz music. It makes for a pretty distinctive concoction it has to be said. The production values in general seem very good here and the period detail is never less than completely convincing. The icing on the cake is of course the casting. Mickey Rourke was at the height of his powers at this time and he effortlessly fits the character of Harry Angel. Robert De Niro is very sinister in a slightly unusual role for him. Lisa Bonet is pretty memorable as the girl who Angel dalliances with in New Orleans, while Charlotte Rampling's icy persona is utilised well as a sinister fortune-teller. All-in-all, there is a considerable amount of excellent things about this production and its lukewarm response back in the 80's remains baffling.

","genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"21 March 2014","score":"","review":" With Marvel's success with all their big name superheroes recently, one character that's remained out of the spotlight is the Punisher. There's been multiple attempts at introducing the Punisher to a mainstream audience(this film, the '04 Punisher, and Punisher War Zone) but for whatever reason, none of these attempts have completely worked as none of them made much money and they don't fare any better with the critics either. It seems like the Punisher character will, at least for now, remain only as a fan favorite character of Marvel and not a multi- million dollar movie franchise like Batman or Spider-Man. But does Marvel's first attempt at introducing the character to a wide audience work, or does it deserve to be... punished? Let's find out!The plot starts off with Frank Castle already being the Punisher, the most wanted and mysterious vigilante of the city. Frank became the Punisher due to him losing his family to a car bombing by notorious mobster Gianni Franco, causing him to begin his war on crime. Over the past five years, Frank has weakened so much of the mob, Franco decides to come in and take control. This, however, has attracted the Yakuza. Lady Tanaka, the leader of the Yakuza, decides to take over all the mob families and their interests by kidnapping their children and holding them for ransom.What this film does the best, is its portrayal of the Punisher. While Dolph Lundgren was very miscast in the role, the way The Punisher himself is written is very interesting. This film surprisingly doesn't portray the Punisher as a full-on hero nor an anti- hero either. Instead, they make him out to be this very GREY moral figure that the film never completely makes its mind on whether or not is he the good guy. Sure, he kicks a lot of a$$ throughout the film but he's also shown to be a bit of a sociopath as he shows no mercy at all to crime and considers anyone who's even ASSOCIATED with the mob deserving of death. This makes him a very extreme and dangerous individual who's not even sure himself that he's doing the right thing and that's what makes his character fascinating. On one hand, we can sympathize with him and understand where he's coming from but on the other hand, he's a sociopath and his simplistic black and white view of the world certainly isn't completely true. Thankfully, the film ends on a very ambiguous note, leaving the audience decide on their own whether or not is he the good guy.The film also has pretty stylish direction for what is, essentially, an 80's B-grade action flick. The director of the film is Mark Goldblatt, who's well-known in the industry as editor for films such as The Terminator, True Lies, Terminator 2, Starship Troopers, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and many more but he's not too well-known as a DIRECTOR but I think he did a pretty solid job on this film. He told the story in a very dynamic way with very dynamic camera-work and a very brutal, gritty feel but didn't go too far with the violence like in Punisher War Zone, it felt more realistic than comic-bookish. I think he should have been given more chances to direct after this film.The score by Dennis Dreath is typical 80's action movie music and it's awesome. I love the theme for the Punisher, it sounds very tough and menacing and it fits the character very well. The score also helped heighten the excitement with the action scenes which, to be honest, weren't anything special.The action for the film just felt very weak. There's some cool hand-to- hand combat scenes here and there and seeing traditional blood squibs is always better than the digital crap we get today but the problem with the action in this movie is that it's all really forgettable. A lot of it's really short, and there's not a whole lot of exciting stunts being pulled off. All the Punisher does, is run right into enemy fire and mows them down with a machine-gun Rambo style. I would've liked to see a bit more strategy with the Punisher's killing methods and some more dangerous stunts but, I guess the action in the film's acceptable for a movie made with $9 million dollars.The pacing of the film is another problem. It moves a bit too fast for the audience to know Frank well as a character. I like what they did with him but I think they could have done more had if the film slowed down a bit and focused on HIM a bit more as opposed to the action or the other characters.The cast in the film is mostly pretty good, but Lundgren just seems really uncomfortable in the part. He seems far too lumbering and brutish for a guy who's supposed to be a very sharp, calculated assassin. I think the part should have been given to someone like Bruce Willis or Mel Gibson instead. Louis Gossett, Jr. is very believable as Jake, the cop Frank used to befriend. I buy his previous friendship with Frank very well. Jeroen Krabbe does a good job playing both Franco as a silmy mobster and a family man. But for me, the biggest scene stealer was Kim Miyori as Lady Tanaka. She came off genuinely sinister and evil but also with a sense of intelligence and manipulation. And plus, she's kinda hot. The rest of the cast did fine.Overall, The Punisher is certainly not a perfect film. Its action is underwhelming, Lundgren is miscast in the lead role, and the pacing's a little off. However, because of how interesting I found the Punisher to be as a character, and how stylish the direction was and how cool the score was, I'd say... give it a watch. Just don't expect a masterpiece. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 March 2014","score":"","review":" With Marvel's success with all their big name superheroes recently, one character that's remained out of the spotlight is the Punisher.

I like what they did with him but I think they could have done more had if the film slowed down a bit and focused on HIM a bit more as opposed to the action or the other characters.The cast in the film is mostly pretty good, but Lundgren just seems really uncomfortable in the part. He seems far too lumbering and brutish for a guy who's supposed to be a very sharp, calculated assassin. I think the part should have been given to someone like Bruce Willis or Mel Gibson instead. Louis Gossett, Jr. is very believable as Jake, the cop Frank used to befriend. I buy his previous friendship with Frank very well. Jeroen Krabbe does a good job playing both Franco as a silmy mobster and a family man. But for me, the biggest scene stealer was Kim Miyori as Lady Tanaka. She came off genuinely sinister and evil but also with a sense of intelligence and manipulation. And plus, she's kinda hot. The rest of the cast did fine.Overall, The Punisher is certainly not a perfect film. Its action is underwhelming, Lundgren is miscast in the lead role, and the pacing's a little off. However, because of how interesting I found the Punisher to be as a character, and how stylish the direction was and how cool the score was, I'd say... give it a watch. Just don't expect a masterpiece. 6\/10 ","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"21 March 2014","score":"","review":" The fascinating thing about mysteries isn't so much the matter of finding the solutions but the different possibilities that are drawn up, it's true most of the theories are incorrect but due to their plausibility who's to say things couldn't of gone this or that way.This is one of my favorite comedies but also one of my favorite mystery films and films in general.

I love the fact that despite likely suspect it's not obvious, most mysteries now unfortunately have this bad habbit of waving the answer right in front of us which really I feel nullifies the intrigue, not giving us enough of a chance to figure some things out ourselves.

It's funny how dryly funny she really is, my favorite moment was when she tells the story about a couple of her dead husbands, I find it blackly humorous not just from how bizarre the deaths were but how it makes her obviously suspicious. Martin Mull is also great as Colonel Mustard whom is hardly true to his rank since in reality he's really a complete wuss. Lesley Ann Warren whom at the time was kinda hot really fits the role of Ms. Scarlett well, she has a sort of crackling charisma.Though my favorite character is Wadsworth played by one of my favorite actors Tim Curry he is just fraking hilarious, this is probably my favorite role from him. He just has some of the best lines and dialog, I love how energetic he is as well as really smart and in control, really does work well under pressure in an uncontrollable situation and looks like any moment he could lose his composure. He's probably the only sympathetic one of the bunch (or it seems that way) since his motive in things seem more genuine. My favorite moment with him was no doubt when he explains how he solves the case by going step by step, which really involved him doing a lot of physical comedy and talking quickly which all admit was both hilarious and exhausting.The parody in this film works, there are all of the clichés and elements from those murder mansion mysteries, some obvious but others are suttle or addressed.

After all, he'd been given all the signs that the only way to secure success at the Oscars was to appear in a huge sprawling epic that crowbars in social commentary. So it would stand to reason that he would invest so much - personally and financially - to see this sprawling epic onto the screen. Sadly, lightning doesn't appear to have struck twice. There's no doubt that the film looks good on screen and it's plain to see where the money went. However, despite everything looking OK on the surface, the film is as deep as a puddle in a car park with barely a single cohesive thought between its watery ears. It simply makes no sense but hey, at least it looks good! Right? Some time in the future, the Earth has disappeared beneath the waves after the polar ice caps have melted. Drifting on the vast high seas is The Mariner (Costner), a stranger who gets by alone by trading whatever he finds. Arriving at a floating atoll, he finds himself imprisoned by the citizens who quickly have to defend themselves from marauding pirates known as Smokers. Led by the charismatic Deacon (Dennis Hopper), they are searching for a child (Tina Majorino) with a tattoo on her back which apparently leads to dry land. In the chaos, the Mariner escapes with little Enola and her protector Helen (Jeanne Tripplehorn) but does Enola really have a map to dry land and is The Mariner really all that he seems? There is plenty to give praise to Waterworld for, chiefly the look of the thing. From the Mariner's odd-looking trimaran to the huge floating sets, it's much more than Mad Max on water. The action is also first-class as jet-skis blast their way through the sets, explosions rip the screen apart and stunt work is of an exceptional standard. Sadly, the same cannot be said for the acting which is almost as wooden as the floating sets. Costner holds the same expression throughout while Hopper hams it up tremendously as the pantomime villain. The other issue I cannot ignore is the apparent lack of thought behind it. Take the apparent value in a few scraps of paper - if paper is that precious then why does Deacon smoke so much of it? There are other gaping gaps in logic like how did so many jet-skis survive such a cataclysmic event (and keep working after so many years). If Costner is trying to preach to us then why throw in little comic touches such as Deacon's ship being the extremely rusty Exxon Valdez? Why do guns simply not hit anything beyond point-blank range (and jam whenever it's least appropriate) but harpoons can hit everything at whatever range and target it's fired or thrown at? For a film set on the ocean waves, it's the lack of depth that sinks Waterworld before it gets a chance to leave port. On the surface, everything looks fine but if you stop to look at it for any longer than a few moments, the cracks are all too visible. Whether the story needed more work or Costner's influence behind the scenes needed curtailing, it's difficult to know exactly where it all began to go wrong. It's not a complete bust - it's big dumb fun that undemanding viewers can appreciate somewhat but the question that keeps popping back in my mind is was Waterworld really worth all that wonga? Frankly, it's nowhere near worth it - remember that this was the most expensive film ever made until Titanic. It's fair to say that Waterworld is certainly one film that will be remembered but not for the reasons Costner intended. It is a monstrous testament to the ego of Costner and his mistaken belief that because he has Oscars on his mantelpiece, he knows best. Dances With Wolves worked because it was different from most westerns seen at that time and it had something to say about racial differences. Waterworld is basically your average post-apocalyptic blaster but set on the waves instead of a desert somewhere. If you can separate the film from the tide of publicity about it then you'll get a kick out of a mindless but well-made action flick. But good luck - the negative press acts as an anchor to the film, dragging it down beneath the waves.

I killed that when I told you about Rebecca. It's gone. In a few hours, you've grown so much older. The despondency, regret and sense of loss that are embodied in these words are incredibly profound and typify the general atmosphere of gloom and melancholy that's such a strong and important feature of this extraordinary film.During a short stay in Monte Carlo, a naïve young lady who works as a paid companion for a rich overbearing society woman meets and falls in love with an older aristocratic Englishman called Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier). Their relationship develops rapidly and soon the young lady becomes the second Mrs de Winter (Joan Fontaine) and returns with her new husband to his enormous estate in Cornwall and his huge mansion called Manderley.Maxim is a moody widower whose first wife, Rebecca, died in a boating accident. He's often brusque with his wife and she assumes that his sudden outbursts of anger are linked to his inability to come to terms with the loss of Rebecca. When she becomes the new mistress of Manderley, the second Mrs de Winter is soon overwhelmed by her new role and starts to feel rather isolated because of the aloofness of her staff and her husband's rather distant manner. She's also surprised and intimidated by the degree to which the spectre of Rebecca seems to be ever-present as everyone in the mansion (including Maxim) seems obsessed with Rebecca.Mrs Danvers (Judith Anderson) is the cold, severe looking housekeeper who adored Rebecca and now keeps her room exactly as it was when her previous mistress was alive. Her hostility to the second Mrs de Winter is obvious from their first meeting and she does everything within her power to undermine her new mistress including trying to get her to commit suicide. The feelings of fear, inadequacy and powerlessness that the second Mrs de Winter experiences at this point are intense but soon everything changes when a sunken boat is discovered nearby with a body inside it. A whole series of revelations then follow and make it clear that so many things at Manderley were not as they had originally appeared to be.Laurence Olivier's performance as a tormented man who's haunted by his past is very good but definitely outshone by Joan Fontaine and Judith Anderson. Fontaine's expressions and body language convey her character's timidity, uncertainty and sincerity with enormous power and Judith Anderson is convincingly evil as one of movie history's most memorable villains.An interesting feature of Rebecca is the techniques that are used to make the second Mrs de Winter appear insignificant and inferior. Not only does she get cruelly dominated by her employer in Monte Carlo and consistently patronised by Maxim but she's also denied even the basic dignity of having a name. When she's first introduced to the staff at Manderley, she's made to feel uncomfortable and embarrassed because she's rain-soaked and dishevelled and visually, the distorted dimensions of the interiors of Manderley make her look physically smaller, lost and out of her depth in her impressive new surroundings.Although Alfred Hitchcock famously dismissed Rebecca as not being a Hitchcock film, it's an exceptionally good film that's very well directed with numerous touches that are characteristic of the great director's work.

He's often brusque with his wife and she assumes that his sudden outbursts of anger are linked to his inability to come to terms with the loss of Rebecca. When she becomes the new mistress of Manderley, the second Mrs de Winter is soon overwhelmed by her new role and starts to feel rather isolated because of the aloofness of her staff and her husband's rather distant manner. She's also surprised and intimidated by the degree to which the spectre of Rebecca seems to be ever-present as everyone in the mansion (including Maxim) seems obsessed with Rebecca.Mrs Danvers (Judith Anderson) is the cold, severe looking housekeeper who adored Rebecca and now keeps her room exactly as it was when her previous mistress was alive. Her hostility to the second Mrs de Winter is obvious from their first meeting and she does everything within her power to undermine her new mistress including trying to get her to commit suicide. The feelings of fear, inadequacy and powerlessness that the second Mrs de Winter experiences at this point are intense but soon everything changes when a sunken boat is discovered nearby with a body inside it. A whole series of revelations then follow and make it clear that so many things at Manderley were not as they had originally appeared to be.Laurence Olivier's performance as a tormented man who's haunted by his past is very good but definitely outshone by Joan Fontaine and Judith Anderson. Fontaine's expressions and body language convey her character's timidity, uncertainty and sincerity with enormous power and Judith Anderson is convincingly evil as one of movie history's most memorable villains.An interesting feature of Rebecca is the techniques that are used to make the second Mrs de Winter appear insignificant and inferior. Not only does she get cruelly dominated by her employer in Monte Carlo and consistently patronised by Maxim but she's also denied even the basic dignity of having a name. When she's first introduced to the staff at Manderley, she's made to feel uncomfortable and embarrassed because she's rain-soaked and dishevelled and visually, the distorted dimensions of the interiors of Manderley make her look physically smaller, lost and out of her depth in her impressive new surroundings.Although Alfred Hitchcock famously dismissed Rebecca as not being a Hitchcock film, it's an exceptionally good film that's very well directed with numerous touches that are characteristic of the great director's work.

Then he retreats into deep space after jettisoning his cargo in an attempt to signal the others that he has been blown up, hence the name 'silent running.'

Henry is a quiet man in a dystopian, industrialized world. He is thrust into a relationship and fatherhood he's not ready for and slowly finds himself succumbing to the pressure of it all.The Good This is the hardest type of film to review. It's one of interpretation, symbolism and hidden meanings. Ten different people can watch it and come away with ten different interpretations of the film, which is likely what Lynch was going for in the first place. For me personally, I am not going to take some artsy-fartsy approach to this movie and simply state if you can't understand the meaning, then it is too artistic for you. I hate that sort of thing. I get that this isn't a movie for everyone, but you have to be able to relate to the film one way or another or the concept is simply lost on the viewer. Lynch didn't lose me, but there were times when I was certainly confused. What I did love about the film was how well Lynch conveyed the plight of Henry without dialogue. The industrialization of the world Lynch portrays is a hissing, steaming, rumbling, disconcerting environment that grates on your nerves as you watch Henry toss and turn in the unsettling apartment. It reminded me a lot of the Japanese film Tetsuo The Iron Man. The imagery, such as the un-potted plants (basically, just mounds of dirt with plants in them) the radiator, the constant rain and whirring of machinery, the dream sequences... all these things captivate the viewer and regardless of whether it all makes sense, you understand Henry's fears and inner desires. As a husband and a father, I can understand the stresses of that role and for someone not prepared for it, this is a great visual and visceral way to watch that experience play out. Who wouldn't be haunted by finding out your girlfriend just gave birth to Admiral Ackbar? The Bad The movie simply gets too out there at times. I've only watched the movie once, true, but there were too many head-scratching moments and they begin to stack up by the end of the film. It ends up feeling cumbersome to watch. I feel like I could watch it ten more times and still not understand certain elements of the story. There is most certainly a core storyline to be followed that is somewhat clear and the viewer clings to that (even if it that storyline is itself somewhat ambiguous), but when we start getting to the Eraserhead sequences, most viewers are going to get left in the dust. Art-house folks will praise it for that value and give it a 10. Mainstream movie lovers will give it a 1 because, at times, it makes no sense in logical movie terms. Me, I found it fascinating, yet too metaphoric in parts, so I can give it nothing but a middle of the road grade.The Interpreted I find that films that require too much interpretation can be taxing on the viewer. I'm not saying everything has to be spelled out or wrapped up nice and neat with a big, red bow, but interpretation has it's limits for me. This one somewhat exceeded those limits. While certain aspects of the film (mostly the cinematography) were visually appealing, the feeling of what is going on? isn't an enjoyable one when watching a film, especially when the story isn't tied together all that well at the end. There were metaphorical props in this movie that, aside from not even knowing what they symbolized with respect to the story... hell, I didn't even know what I was looking at!

Thoroughly disturbed by this incident, Bill decides to call it quits with his practice. After his friend Bob Moore is murdered, Bill is coerced into taking over for him and his patients. Things become increasingly perplexing when the patients are getting killed off, and he gets involved with a sexually charged, slightly promiscuous woman, who seems to have psychological issues of her own (Jane March)This was potentially a career killer for Bruce Willis. I realize he was trying to expand his range, but this was a very risky choice for Bruce. It was ripped to shreds by the pretentious, fickle pundits. People were exasperated about the unflattering material in this movie. What did I think of it? I'm not gonna deny that this movie is a train-wreck of epic proportions, but it can be very entertaining in a so bad its good way. This is one of those turkey's that is a wet dream for bad movie lovers. It's so ludicrous that I couldn't help but enjoy myself. I watched the director's cut version. It's almost 140 minutes long (!) I can definitely see why they decided to trim it some for a theatrical release. This movie does have a murder mystery, but let's not pretend that it's what this movie is truly about. It's about salacious sex scenes, vivid ones at that. You haven't seen provocative or steamy eroticism in a mainstream movie until you've seen this one. This is somewhat of a soft-core porno at times with how it comes across. The sex is the selling point of this movie, not the mystery. As far as sex scenes are concerned, you'll be hard pressed to find much better. Willis even shows glimpse of his penis at one point! The violence is poured on thick in this one. People are stabbed, somebody is impaled through a shard of glass. We also get fun with nails and more. This one isn't afraid to be mean. The acting is enjoyable, if unexceptional. Bruce Willis is motivated in this one, I'll say that. He's likable and brave to take on such a controversial project. I wouldn't call it a great performance, but he's very solid. Jane March is sexy as a conniving woman. Her unpredictability kept her interesting. She had decent chemistry with Willis as well. I didn't really buy the intense passion they shared in all honesty, but they certainly weren't awkward. Lance Henriksen & Brad Douriff are both fun in their respective parts as patients. The ending throws in a decent twist, shades of Hitchcock as well. The problem, is that the killer is easy to guessThis movie isn't very good, though I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it. People can chastise it all they want, but I love entertainingly bad movies. Despite the over length, this is an undeniably messed up film that bad movie lovers can enjoy.
