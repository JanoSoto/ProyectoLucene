What do you think of when you read it? The talkin' to me? scene? Bickle's quietly psychotic, one sided smile? The suit? The spring-loaded gun? The mohawk? For me, it's the mohawk. There's a lot to think about in Taxi Driver, one of Martin Scorcese's best films.Taxi Driver is a slow film, or so it seems. There's very little action except for the end, and that can be a big turn-off, especially if you've seen other Scorcese films. But after you see the complete idea, things fall into place. Then you start to like the film. I saw it six hours ago, and I like it more each minute.I realize the second time around the plot follows two paths Bickle's downward spiral with Betsy and his... noble spiral with Iris. And when his downward spiral doesn't quite work out, he diverts that urge to his other arc. This view made my perception of the film clearer, knowing that the two plots bounce off each other. A second viewing is really beneficial.Many things are great. The first and foremost is Robert De Niro. I believe this is the best work I've seen him in, better than Raging Bull for sure, in my opinion. Here, he is the master of subtle. The half smile, the casual hair, it seems he's just a quiet guy, but it's much more than that. It's much more beneficial to the viewer to know he's very unstable. Not insane, just unstable. It creates edge, and tension. You feel bad for him- he's a Vietnam veteran, come back to America, living in New York. He's lonely. It's sad. I find it unfair to call him a villain, as the AFI believes. He's an anti-hero. We like him, because of our perspective. We wouldn't like to meet him. He is Taxi Driver. This is a film about Travis Bickle's descent.New York. That's where this takes place, and that's important. Most is seen through Travis' windshield, because that's all we need to see New York is the spawn of scum. That's what we need to believe. Also, neon lights are everywhere. What helps us along are some blurry shots, locations, and the catchiest, almost overused sax groove ever.Many people have praised Jodie Foster, but I really can't see it. She's in maybe a half hour of the movie, despite being so key to the plot that she's on the plot summary. *Edit* I just saw the film again, and I like her much better the second time. She's sympathetic.The last act of the film, starting with the iconic mohawk, is a cinematic masterpiece. It's a shame it took so long to get there though. I would rate this film much higher if the beginning had some kind of action, tension or intensity, to show what was to come. There's no bang in the first hour, which makes the film less enjoyable at the time. Maybe if the robbery was earlier, or if Travis had a violent customer? There's a lot about Taxi Driver I can't talk about, it has to be seen. Post-viewing, it seems much more dreamlike than you remember, and in a good way. It's the small things that complete this, the things you only remember as they happen. If only it was more engaging from the start, Taxi Driver would be in my eyes, an untouchable classic.This is a film about the human mind, and what loneliness can do to it. *Edit* After seeing the film again, it's grown on me even more.

In this film John Hammond played by Richard Attenborough created and owns a theme-park he has named Jurassic Park. This park is different than most in that it is inhabited by cloned dinosaurs. Dr. Ian Malcolm played by Jeff Goldblum, Dr. Alan Grant played by Sam Neill and Dr. Ellie Sattler played by Laura Dern are all asked to come analyze the safety factor of the park after someone is attacked. At the same time Hammonds two grandchildren Lex and Tim, played by Ariana Richards and Tim Murphy, are also visiting the park. While all of these people are observing the park things go haywire due to a power outage and the dinosaurs start attacking the people.The theme of Jurassic Park is just because you can do something, doesn't mean that you should. John Hammond was so wrapped up in being able to use his money and technology to do something that no one else has or could do, that he didn't take the time to think about the consequences. Sure, it's great to be cutting edge and create something great for people to enjoy. However, before doing something like this it would be best to stop and rationalize what you are really doing. This movie is a great example of how things can get out of hand really fast. Hammond had great intentions going into this project of his but he also put a lot of people in danger including Lex and Tim, his grandchildren. They were there to visit with him and see the park and ended up fighting for their lives. Thankfully, Dr. Malcolm and Dr. Sattler were there protecting them as best they could.It is imperative that people take the time to analyze things before taking action, especially when dealing with something as sensitive as cloning an endangered species. Dealing with something so volatile, you would never know what to expect. Hammond was so caught up with being able to do something because no one else could and with greed of how much money he could make that he didn't test the parks safety until it was too late. It would have been wise to request the Dr.'s visit before actually cloning these animals and starting a park. It would have been wise to think about those animals as well. The whole idea of creating these animals that have been extinct for millions of years and placing them on display seems a bit over the edge. While Dr. Malcolm and Dr. Sattler are amazed at the genius at the park and the beauty of the animals, they also realize from the get-go that things must be thought through scientifically and logically.One motif that is repeated throughout the film is the way the film encourages anticipation through movement. There are the scenes where you see water movement making you anticipate what is coming, how big it is and what is it going to do when it gets here? The ground may start to vibrate and this alerts the Dr.'s, the children, Hammond, etc. that something is coming. The movement of the trees and bushes in the scene where the cow is being fed to the raptor is unforgettable; you can tell by the movements what is happening. Leaving it up to the viewer's imagination was classic. This coincides with the theme nicely. Not knowing what to expect is clearly displayed throughout the film. This film thrives on the unexpected. Could Hammond really not foresee something like this happening? This film used sounds effectively. The sound worked with the movements to build to the excitement and fear for the characters, as well as, for the audience. The sound of the dinosaurs roaring make you feel like you are there and actually sends fear through the viewers. The stomping sounds of the dinosaurs approaching the characters send chills down your back. Again, the scene where the raptor is given the cow is a prime example. You can hear the cow's cries, the dinosaur attacking, the movement in the trees and the crunching sound of that poor cow being made into dinner. These sounds actually make you sit back and say, he really should of thought this thing through or is revenue really worth risking all of this for? The film Splice compares with Jurassic Park. It's another case of hindsight being 20\/20. The scientist in this film also don't stop to think things through because they are so wrapped up in creating something because they can. They splice DNA of different organisms together to create other species. One of them takes it too far and add's in her own DNA creating this creature that ends up destroying them all.In the end, technology is great; making money is great. However, when faced with a challenge or an opportunity, we must step back and decide if we should do something just because we can. It's important to remember that technology is not fool proof and the movie is a prime example of that. Take into account that things can go wrong and that negative consequences can outweigh benefits in situations. Using rationale, logic and moral code is important in any venture.

I was entertained beyond belief by these two dimwits who knew nothing in the world outside of their couch and their television. Seeing this movie young, most likely around ten, I honestly didn't like it. I found it to be boring and I hated how Beavis and Butthead left the town of Highland and ventured out into the big world.I watched it a year later and went on to like it. This is my third viewing. Now I can fully appreciate it. I understood all the jokes, but at the same time I wished the film took place in the town of Highland, I realize that the creators and the director, respectively, had to create a plot that was very large and made to fit an eighty-five minute run time. Not the usual five to ten minute run time the MTV program was used to.At the time, this movie was the near conclusion to the MTV program that ran for five years. There was rumored to be a sequel for years, and remained in development, but never happened. Fine by me. We got something better. It took fifteen years, but in 2011 it's said that the show will return to MTV with brand new episodes poking fun at music videos and viral videos. I'm skeptical, yet my excitement is through the roof.Beavis and Butthead Do America is about the two adolescents that go in search of their missing television set. Wandering into a motel, they become mistaken by a drunk named Muddy (Willis) as the men he hired to kill his wife. Saying he hired them to do his wife, the boys believe they are being payed to have sex with Muddy's wife. The boys don't object, but then become labeled the most dangerous men in America by the FBI who are in search of a mysterious chip they call the unit. The humor isn't as racy as people would expect. It maintains a PG-13 rating, and uses it neutrally. That comes off as one of its flaws, sadly. Like the South Park movie that boasted an R rating with very foul language and sex references, clearly showed what could be on the big screen differs greatly from Comedy Central. With Beavis and Butthead Do America, it does the same thing it would've done if it were a TV movie. Even The Simpson's Movie went a little further than its FOX limits.Still, it's worth it for the pleasure of seeing one of the greatest animated duos on the big screen doing what they do best, nothing. The best thing about the teens is they get in trouble, without even trying to get in trouble. They are a victim of bad timing, but somehow avoid every possible consequence. The FBI agent orders roadblocks, they are in the middle of the desert. They order the Dream America bus to stop, they get on a Nun's bus.My favorite scene is when their peace'd out teacher tries to tell them from the bottom of his heart that having no Television actually opens a window of opportunity. He claims people need to realize that we don't need TV to entertain us. After that very near and dear moment, all they pick up is entert(ain us). Beavis and Butthead Do America has gotten better with repeated viewings, but is seems it never was boring. I think being young and dumb, the film didn't sit right with me for the reasons I stated above. After the third time, it was pretty cool.Starring Mike Judge, Demi Moore, and Bruce Willis.

I was entertained beyond belief by these two dimwits who knew nothing in the world outside of their couch and their television. Seeing this movie young, most likely around ten, I honestly didn't like it. I found it to be boring and I hated how Beavis and Butthead left the town of Highland and ventured out into the big world.I watched it a year later and went on to like it. This is my third viewing. Now I can fully appreciate it. I understood all the jokes, but at the same time I wished the film took place in the town of Highland, I realize that the creators and the director, respectively, had to create a plot that was very large and made to fit an eighty-five minute run time. Not the usual five to ten minute run time the MTV program was used to.At the time, this movie was the near conclusion to the MTV program that ran for five years. There was rumored to be a sequel for years, and remained in development, but never happened. Fine by me. We got something better. It took fifteen years, but in 2011 it's said that the show will return to MTV with brand new episodes poking fun at music videos and viral videos. I'm skeptical, yet my excitement is through the roof.Beavis and Butthead Do America is about the two adolescents that go in search of their missing television set.

One thing to say is that it is extremely challenging viewing and if you are unsure of watching this make sure you know what you are in for first. Not that anything could prepare you for this film, but be aware that it is a dark and often disturbing look into some of the most troublesome aspects of human behaviour.I can't say that this is an enjoyable film - that surely isn't the right word. However, this is filmmaking at its very best, coupled with a central performance from Isabelle Huppert that genuinely deserves the high praise it has received. I was only introduced to Michael Haneke very recently, and this is only the 2nd of his films that I have seen, but he is clearly an incredibly gifted director and writer who makes films almost unlike any others I have seen.Films of sustained intensity and anxiety are quite rare, and there are very few films I have seen that are able to achieve the intense and foreboding atmosphere that Haneke, and also Isabelle Huppert, craft here. What is unique is that Haneke doesn't rely on a chilling musical score to build tension, nor is the film cast in dark and brooding light that suggests to us what the underlying nature of the story is. Haneke builds the tension with supreme subtlety and ingenious craft. The only music that is used comes from the piano playing of the characters themselves; the beautiful and artistic music is juxtaposed with the dark and secretive thoughts of Erika. We gradually delve into the troubled mind of the otherwise austere piano teacher, Erika, and get glimpses of a side of her which initially seems almost out of place. Her acts are played out to a backdrop of a sad and lonely existence, one in which she is still controlled by a domineering and rather embittered mother. The mother, played excellently by Annie Girardot, perhaps gives us a tiny insight into why Erika feels trapped and repressed.Huppert is astounding and the subtle nuances of her performance are indicative of an actress at the very top of her game. Huppert conveys so much fear, sadness, lust, anger and even love through a veneer of temperance. She constantly reminds us that these feelings are largely repressed and yet we can see them bubbling under the surface. Huppert betrays these underlying dark emotions often with as little as a slight shift in her facial expression &#x96; make no mistake this is acting of the highest calibre; subtle, understated and yet utterly powerful and compelling.The actions of Erika are often quite alarming and certainly not appealing, and yet it is the hallmark of excellence, in both Haneke's script and Huppert's performance, that we can still sympathise with this woman. Even, if it is only a fleeting glimpse of sympathy or understanding &#x96; it is still there. That is how I felt, and that is another reason why the film is so challenging. Should I feel sympathy? Should I feel anger? Should I feel disgust? Haneke doesn't insist that we feel one way or another, he lets the power of the story carry itself and the viewer is left to sift through this thickened sea of conflicting emotion.As I said at the start, I don't think I can do this film justice on paper &#x96; it has to be seen; and if you do choose to see it you will get something much more &#x96; you will feel your way through it. As I watched this film I felt an array of different emotions; I was gripped, tense, anxious, saddened, disgusted and much more. By the end I had a barrage of unanswered questions and I wasn't even sure how to feel about what I'd seen. That is the beauty, and I do mean beauty, of this incredibly thought-provoking and dark film. If after reading this you think you can stomach the content then I would encourage you to watch it for a very unique film experience.

He decides to go by car and along the road he stops at places where he had memories as a young man. He also meets few interesting characters along the road and have dreams that shows his fears of being a lonely old man.

I also didn't like how blunt some parts were in showing that he is a cold old man, it was more like Bergman was giving us facts with not much reasons behind it, of course through the movie you understand why is he that ruthless, but it was mentioned too much from different characters and too bluntly. And I must admit, unfortunately I didn't enjoy the language much (sorry!).Was it a good movie? yes indeed! but I wouldn't watch it again, it didn't leave me wondering and I was bored at the beginning.its-lalas-land.blogspot.com ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"16 June 2011","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Princess Mononoke is one of those films that you don't hear much about, but one day you stumble upon it and you have the urge to watch that movie some time.

Hoffman starts an affair with his dad's business partner's wife, however he falls in love with her daughter and things turn pretty complicated.

Although I whole heartedly believe that Dustin Hoffman is a brilliant actor, I thought he was okay in the movie, good acting but not really inspiring. Here I must give it to Anne Bancroft, she was the only one who showed extreme professionally in that movie, she was cold and bold and just a pretty good actress. One of my fav scenes was showing how suffocated Hoffman was.I thought there were good camera angles, lighting, but what I really liked was the editing! for the 60's that movie was really really well edited.

Unfortunately, the task appears to be beyond him.The Age of Innocence is Wharton's exploration into the finer details of New York high society circa the late 19th century. The focal character is attorney Newland Archer (played here by Daniel Day-Lewis), who is the walking personification of pristine high society. He is engaged to be married to the oh-so-acceptable May Welland (Winona Ryder), but then meets her scandalous cousin, the Countess Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), a black sheep now that she has separated from her husband. Suddenly Newland's heart is all atwitter and he finds himself willing to risk his reputation and social standing to pursue her.The central romance is strangely missing any romance, much less passion. Scorsese seems far more enamored of the set design, costumes and fancy finery, then he is with the people at the heart of the action. The majority of the people seem anemic, with possibly the exception of a feisty Miriam Margoyles, who seems far more scandalous than Pfeiffer with her loud and oddly hilarious outbursts. Lots of time is spent documenting the dinnerware, etiquette and bearing of the elites, to the point where one starts to cast longing gazes at their watch. And in case you don't get it, Scorsese has decided to include mind-numbingly obvious narration from the cultured tones of Joanne Woodward. Woodward's narration becomes increasingly intrusive to the point where it not only tells us that someone walks across the room (as though we did not witness it), but gives us insight into what people are thinking, as if this is not something the performances should be doing.When not doting on the lovely china, draperies and lace doilies, Scorsese employs rather annoying camera tricks to open or close scenes, and gives us endless montages of hothouse flowers ripening in stop motion - to hint at the emotion roiling beneath the surface of these well-dressed mannequins. Oh, the depth! Some of the acting is quite fine, even with the restrictions placed on it by the storyline. It is intriguing to watch Day-Lewis portray such an inhibited character as Newland Archer. We have some degree of sympathy for Newland, although he brings a lot of his misery on himself. However, we never have much respect for him, because at heart the character is incredibly weak and allows himself to repeatedly be at the mercy of those around him. Day-Lewis conveys a great deal of the frustration and angst of the character. Unfortunately, one thing that does not get conveyed is the longing and passion of his love for the Countess.This last is certainly not all Day-Lewis' fault. Pfeiffer's scandalous cousin is such a jaw-dropping bore and played by the usually reliable actress with such lifelessness that it is impossible to understand how she can awaken longing in anyone. Pfeiffer, strangely resembling a young Lucille Ball here, carries herself ramrod straight with a slight air of discomfort, as though she was bothered by hemorrhoids. She delivers her lines either haltingly or breathlessly in a manner that strains patience. Were it not for the incessant reminders, we would detect nothing interesting - much less scandalous - about her. In fact, she hardly seems to be suffering as a pariah at all since she seems to chronically show up at all of the prime spots. Even worse, her character pales in comparison to May Welland, who is supposed to be the duller of the two women.And here we have another of the film's faults. Winona Ryder is positively radiant as May and delivers one of her last great performances prior to becoming this generation's Hedy Lamarr and forgetting how to act. She does a fantastic job of portraying Archer's still waters run deep fiancée and often seems a far more intriguing love interest. When she senses the attraction between Newland and her cousin, she repeatedly offers him an out to launch his pursuit, which he fails to take her up on. Later, when Newland decides he wants an out at a far more inappropriate time, she does a grand job of insidiously psychologically closing off his paths for escape and ensuring his continued subservience to her, even if he is only going through the motions. Ryder's performance is really quite wonderful here and the fact that one remembers her character far more so than Pfeiffer's indicates a vital flaw in the piece.Due to so much exposition and pontificating on the backdrops, the film is entirely too long for its slight story and it feels it. By the time it grinds to its predictable and emotionally muted conclusion, one is more than ready for the experience to be over. The final sequence with an older Day-Lewis offered the opportunity to once again meet and continue his relationship with Pfeiffer (with the approval of his now late wife) only to culminate with him sitting dumbfounded on a bench before walking away without meeting her ranks as one of the most pointless codas on a film. Truly, the film would have been more improved had Scorsese ended it following the final confrontation between Day-Lewis and Ryder.A lovely looking film, but unless you are interested in seeing Scorsese direct a change-of-pace film or have a particular affinity for Wharton's wallows in misery, there is not a lot here to satisfy.

First and foremost the aspect of the movie that had the most heart and realism for me was the older brother Brad's infatuation with Chris the babysitter. He was always the one I identified with as a young boy. He is so enamored of her and is so awkward about it, but at the same time genuine. And yet, unlike most hokey Hollywood films he doesn't magically get the girl. This is what the blues are all about. You love a girl and she doesn't love you back. Elizabeth Shue is amazing as always and I just learned that this was her first movie. I guess as a kid you don't really realize that these people are acting or at least not in this movie because it all seems so natural. She then went on to star in Cocktail, Back to the Future II and II and then Leaving Las Vegas in 1995. Sara, the little girl was the part of this movie that is still enjoyable after all these years. It seems to me that lately children in movies are incredibly annoying or they make the movie dramatic and it isn't enjoyable.

It concocts a barely logical reason for Godzilla's sudden swim to NYC, but the destruction that the creature leaves in its path is so minimal that one wonders why so much military and scientific effort is put into the search for the creature. Indeed, NYC survives largely unscathed from Godzilla's wrath and few people seem in any genuine danger from the creature. A good deal of the destruction, in fact, comes from the blunders of the military in trying to detain the creature. Additionally, we are told that the creature is able to hide within the underground subway system, but given the enormous size of the creature that seems highly unlikely.Additionally, the film is absent of nearly any tension.

Broderick is all wrong to carry an action film and often comes across as a double holding the stage until the real leading man shows up. Azaria seems game, but Reno looks justifiably bored.

At the time that this went into production and was released, this seemed to be a sure thing as a popcorn summer hit. The duo behind the successful Independence Day would resurrect the Toho legend Godzilla from yesteryear to unleash a wave of destruction on New York. The film had massive awareness and was coming on the heels of the mega-hit Jurassic Park &#x96; so dinosaurs and their similars were definitely riding a wave of popularity.The film opens with depictions of nuclear testing by the French in the Pacific Ocean while indigenous lizards look on. Years later, this results in the gigantic mutation that is to become known as Godzilla. For some nonsensical reason, Godzilla starts swimming its way to New York City leaving a trail of underwhelming destruction in its wake. A group of disparate characters pool resources to locate the creature and end its rampage.Unfortunately, what should have been a sure thing here ends in a complete botch. The film is a haphazard mess hanging together by fraying threads.The visual effects are fairly strong, but the film keeps the creature off stage for practically the entire first half and then depicts most of its appearances in rainy darkness. Truthfully, has New York City ever been the victim of such an endless spate of torrential storms as is depicted in this film? The story is fairly asinine. It concocts a barely logical reason for Godzilla's sudden swim to NYC, but the destruction that the creature leaves in its path is so minimal that one wonders why so much military and scientific effort is put into the search for the creature. Indeed, NYC survives largely unscathed from Godzilla's wrath and few people seem in any genuine danger from the creature. A good deal of the destruction, in fact, comes from the blunders of the military in trying to detain the creature. Additionally, we are told that the creature is able to hide within the underground subway system, but given the enormous size of the creature that seems highly unlikely.Additionally, the film is absent of nearly any tension. Director Roland Emmerich imbues everything with such a strangely light-hearted tone that there is no urgency to this material or the ho-hum action scenes that he creates. In fact, the film only truly comes to life in the final 20 minutes and at that point it is simply too late and altogether too brief to salvage this sinking ship. Additionally, once we have the back story, it is hard to feel threatened by or root for the death of the title creature. In fact, some degree of kudos must go to the effects team and screenplay for drumming up sympathy for the creature's plight, particularly in its final moments on screen.By contrast, the people populating this foolishness should be so sympathetic. There are so many useless extraneous characters introduced into the action that one about needs a score card to keep track&#x85;and none of them are killed by the creature. We get Matthew Broderick's dorky scientist, French agent Jean Reno, reporter Maria Pitillo, cameraman Hank Azaria and his blowzy wife Arabella Field, Vicki Lewis' scientist and her assistant Malcolm Danare, military colonel Kevin Dunn, ineffectual mayor Michael Lerner and his assistant Lonny Goldman. The ideas on character development revolve around making Lerner and Goldman an idiotic riff on Siskel and Ebert and Reno a coffee fancier always on the hunt for a great cup of java. The film would not have suffered in the least by cutting or combining any number of these roles. For instance, the Pitillo and Lewis role could easily have been combined into one (preferably Lewis since Pitillo is a nightmare).Acting-wise, the film is equally lamentable. Broderick is all wrong to carry an action film and often comes across as a double holding the stage until the real leading man shows up. Azaria seems game, but Reno looks justifiably bored. The worst performance, hands down, comes from Pitillo, who spends the film whining, crying, pouting and delivering her lines in a voice that reminds one of a low-rent Betty Boop. Simply excruciating.
