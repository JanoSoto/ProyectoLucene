Gattaca raises questions about fate and free will; it pushes back against systemic discrimination, a topic which resonated in 1997 and even more so now. There's a lot to think about in the movie. Jude Law turns in a strong performance. The score is beautiful, elegiac. So as a philosophical inquiry, or visual art, it's pretty good. As a story, though, it stumbles on several counts. There are a few dead-ends in the plot, with the movie setting its characters\/story up for a particular turn of events and then just seemingly forgetting about them; a few tensions raised in the plot are never adequately answered. The characters in the movie (with the exception of Jude Law) do not emotionally respond to the plot like normal human beings; they are oddly flat, ignoring or gliding Vulcan-like over tragedies and heartbreak. The coolness of the characters is all the more unsettling in light of some of the wholly unexplored homoerotic and sexual tension in the film; I don't usually go out for psychological interpretation, but a Freudian reading of Gattaca would be illuminating, I think. The plot itself is a fairly heavy-handed fable. Another reviewer has noted that all the swimming scenes feel like the director is beating us over the head with the message of the story; this is true, and I'd add that Hawke's character's narration does the same thing. It may be a thriller, but it's also very nearly one of Aesop's fables. The final problem I had was that the movie felt very retro. The huge computers, the orange-tint white balance, the orderly, Spartan, wholly undecorated world of Gattaca, the classic body style cars the movie feels like a sci-fi movie filmed in the 60s or 70s, not in the late 90s. Given that 1997 was also the year that Contact came out, and its sci-fi world does not feel retro (heck, Alien was made in the 70s and feels less retro than Gattaca!), I have to assume this is a deliberate choice. But why the filmmakers decided to make their film looking twenty years old when it was brand new, I have no idea. The total lack of atmosphere and clunky machinery contributes to the flatness of the story; against it, the characters (already pretty dull) seem less interesting, not more. At this point, I realize I seem like I wholly hated the film. I didn't. As I noted, there's a lot to think about, and I will probably be thinking about its theme for months to come. Also, even if I didn't agree with the filmmakers' artistic decisions, I did enjoy watching how they were put together. It's not a great film, but it's a decent way to spend a Friday night.

This John Ford classic starring James Stewart and John Wayne brings about a very thought provoking piece to the western genre. The audience will really be challenged to evaluate what they think of right and wrong, and just how absolute the two should be. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance begs the question, will justice always prevail? The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance opens by introducing us to an aged United States Senator as he visits his hometown to attend the funeral of a dear friend. Accompanied by his wife, the audience soon learns that there is quite a history between the deceased person and the Senator. Upon the newspaper reporters' ceaseless questioning of his arrival, the senator goes on to fill them, and the audience, in on the story involving him and the deceased man. Early on in the film a powerful scene takes place in which we meet the main character, Ransom Stoddard (James Stewart) as he is riding in a carriage. Unfortunately for Ransom, he is ambushed by a vicious gang lead by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). After protecting the woman accompanying him, the gang turns their violent focus on Ransom savagely beating him and leaving him for dead. Fortunately for Ransom, Tom Doniphon (John Wayne) peels him up from the path and takes him into town to have a local family tend to his wounds. When he finally comes to, Ransom is stunned, both to see the family tending to him so attentively, and to the realization that there is no accepted idea of justice in this Wild West. Ransom is committed to his belief that justice exists everywhere and as a lawyer, refuses to take arms to protect himself against Liberty Valance and his gang of outlaws. As our story progresses, Ransom stays firm in his notion of justice ruling the land. Ransom remains with the family that took him in, he even teaches the adult daughter of the family how to read and write, eventually marrying Hallie (Vera Miles) Ransom takes his teachings a step further and seeks to educate the entire town on basic principles of law and citizenship. Liberty Valance, however, remains just as committed to keeping the law out of his land and cuts Ransom off at every pass of collective improvement. Tensions rise as the boiling point is finally reached between these two culminating in a surprising shoot-out that has the audience on the edge of their seats. First of all, it needs noted that I am a sucker for a good movie told backwards. No flashbacks took place throughout the film, we are just made aware of the ending, after which the film is told in proper succession. To me, this takes a great deal of precision by a filmmaker, which John Ford is more than capable of. When this type of storytelling is properly achieved, even though the audience knows a great deal of how the story turns out, they are no less interested in how it turns. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a wonderful display of backwards story telling. Another aspect that adds to the story telling of this film is the score. Each change in pitch is punctuated perfectly against the action being told on screen, bringing about a masterpiece of sensory symmetry. The sound effects were also a standout part of this film's experience. For instance, each time Liberty Valance used his weapon of choice, a whip, against his adversary, the sound was realistic enough to give the viewer a sharp sting on their back. Another mark of a great film, for me, is when action is fragmented well between what is seen and unseen. Much of this film reminded me of Burt Lancaster's first film The Killers (1946) in which the most pivotal scene climaxed out of frame proving that when a director can acknowledge the intelligence of the audience, they don't need to put every detail in front of their eyes. This scene, and many others like it, notably from Alfred Hitchcock, has stuck with me years after their initial viewing because there is great power in performing a scene off-camera. This story-telling device requires immense detail and thorough framing; once both of those criterion are met, the audience's mind is free to wonder imaging exactly what the action that took place on screen looked like. This imagination may provide even more depth to a scene than the director would have been able to film. To depict a scene this way also requires a great deal of trust in the actor. In this set-up, a director must be confident that the actor will display enough nonverbal emotion to cue the audience into what is taking place. One illustration of this device occurs when Ransom looks into the casket of his deceased friend and becomes angered that his boots have been removed. If Jimmy Stewart was less of an actor, or if John Ford was less a director, the audience would not have enjoyed such a scene, made all the more powerful by the pinnacle occurring off-camera. Another excellent device used by John Ford was the way he introduced us to John Wayne's character, Tom Doniphon. Tom acted as a savior to Ransom, and a savior is exactly how he was depicted the first time we see him, high upon his horse. One could also notice that Wayne's character first appearing on a horse correlates him to that of a knight, riding up to save the day, which he ultimately did for Ransom. Such direction by John Ford illustrates his legacy and allows the viewer to recognize, first-hand, why he remains a legend more than 40 years after his death.

I think this simple story makes the characters stand out all the better because it really gives them a chance to shine and come to life. It certainly also helps that Lucas was clearly a fan of those cliffhangers from previous decades because he knows how to build up scenes and milk them for everything they're worth.It's really hard to say anything fresh or new about this film but watching this first one it's easy to see why people like Hamill and Fisher became iconic in these parts.

Scarlett's character seemed to me more like a mentally-ill person, ultra immature (too much), with an extreme obsession for Ashley and for the money. I'm sure in real life there are a lot of people today, men or women, just like her, who after getting married they still feel secretly in love with the one they didn't get to have, to the point it becomes an obsession and a reason to leave, even after having a perfect life. But if this type of person was the original type developed by Margaret Mitchell, it would fit better in a thriller movie where the lover is a psycho or a stalker. As I was watching the movie and when Brett and Scarlett finally became a couple, I felt pleased that they were going to be finally a real happy couple, especially for the always charming Rhett. Of course, there's no novel nor movie without obstacles, but in here they seemed to appear out of nowhere. Scarlett with her ill-obsessions seemed to spoil it every time. She just could not see what a great husband and father Brett was and how much he loved her. Was she too immature to not see it (Rhett's love), too obsessed with money and her little palace, too obsessed with Ashley or just mentally sick and oblivious of the world around her? Just until the very end when Ashley's wife, Mel, died, she realized she could love or was in love with Brett but was too late. What a bummer!In terms of the directing choices, there were a couple of mishaps. For instance when in one scene Rhett was mourning his little daughter, completely secluded with his pain, and Melanie was able to convince him to allow the funeral, right after she left the room, she collapsed ill, as if her effort to convince Brett was too physically exhausting. Then, a short scene of the funeral is lacking, because the next scene, when Brett and Scarlett are visiting dying Mel, Rhett now looks completely fine and seems that his immense pain has gone abruptly. Also, in this scene, Scarlett looks again like a psycho woman, completely oblivious of her surrounding circumstances, who doesn't even care about her daughter who had just died nor her ultra close dying friend, but she is solely interested in getting Ashley's love at last right on the spot, regardless of the people around her (that's why she got caught) while Ashley is crying for her beloved wife. At the end of the movie she promises in a maniacal way that she will get him back. Psycho Scarlett. Definitely a very weird character only comparable to Norma Desmond's in Sunset Boulevard.I loved Mammy's acting, she became the first African American to win an academy award. Prissy's character (Butterfly McQueen) was kind of awkward too and also a little bit of a psycho as well, this can be seen when Scarlett had to go to look for the doctor after Prissy refused to do it. She's left in the scene completely out of her mind.

ActingAlright, so let me start this review by stating that I'm a die-hard fan of Jack Nicholson. So, I might be slightly transparent about the flaws of the movie, but there aren't many. This film is very hard to get a hold of actually. I stumbled upon a used DVD store and being a collector of Jack Nicholson's films and a huge fan, I immediately purchased it. I hadn't ever heard of this film until then and made a quick research on IMDb and Wikipedia about the movie. This movie's story is written by Nora Ephron and is loosely based on her life and relationship with real-life journalist Carl Bernstein. On paper, the story of the movie goes like this Divorced woman meets a sort-of heartless playboy, falls for him, marries him, has children with him, and leaves him after figuring out that he's been cheating on her. Sounds so simple, but in reality, it isn't. That's the reason why we have veteran actors like Nicholson and Meryl Streep on board. Meryl Streep is brilliant. Totally. Even in totally clichéd scenes, she performs to her fullest. Many people might be surprised, but this is actually the first film of Meryl Streep I've seen. I had always wanted to see her work ever since learning that she has the most number of Academy Award nominations for Best Actress or Supporting Actress, but never really got around to doing so. I wonder what her really brilliant performances would be like, if this was off the hook itself. Jack Nicholson plays the uber cool guy he always is and as we always have more often than not, there is a scene of him going totally crazy. But I don't want to give away too many things. You should check out the movie for yourself. This movie also marks the feature-film debut of Kevin Spacey, whom I was quite surprised to see actually, but it turned out that it was only a small cameo. Story, Screenplay and Direction Enough about actors. Lets get down to the story, screenplay and ultimately, the execution of the overall film. This film is ultra-realistic. Except a couple of teeny-tiny moments in the film, you'll be surprised at how super realistic that this film is. Being born in the 90s, I was able to get a slight sense of how life revolved in the 80s and was super-thrilled and totally upset in not being able to experience the US of that era. That is also where the film goes awry, in a sense. It is so realistic, that it loses itself onto you at a point where you wouldn't know what is going on. There are hints of Mark (Jack Nicholson) being a brilliant and a sincere reporter, but we really don't get to see much of that. However, we do get to see a couple of scenes of Rachel (Meryl Streep) working in her NY paper where she's a food journalist, but it doesn't go beyond that. Basically, the emphasis is so much on the character's emotions, especially Streep's, that the film kind of weighs down a bit when you reach the 58 minute mark. Other than this slight niggle, this film is amazing. Streep showcases her character's emotions so perfectly that you actually start to feel for her and get a tight sense of what her character is going through. Jack Nicholson shines in whatever scene he's in, as always, but is ultimately weighed down by a superb display by Meryl Streep. I was surprised that she hadn't gotten an Oscar Nomination for this, but hey, Nicholson didn't either, for 'The Shining (1980)', which was one of his best works in the 80s. Technical Work The cinematography is top-notch too, considering the fact that this was the 80s. I had initially thought that this was a Stanley Kubrick film, which always has the best camera work. But it was good to know that Mike Nichols also had an affinity towards great camera work and composition to each and every scene. Lastly, I had learned that this film had become even more popular because of the superb musical score by Carly Simon. 'Coming Around Again' is too good. Whoever you are, whatever era you were born into, you would surely have heard this song, even if you might not be able to recognize it just by reading the name. Overall, this is a brilliant film, with a very few cons. You should definitely watch it, if only for Meryl Streep's performance. This is a very, very highly underrated film.

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"18 December 2015","score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" The original Star Wars trilogy was ground-breaking in its day and attracted millions of loyal fans worldwide. So, expectations were understandably high for the first entry in the prequel trilogy. Unfortunately, rather than witnessing a new benchmark in cinematic greatness, moviegoers were instead subjected the debacle that is The Phantom Menace.Where to begin with the film's problems? For starters, most of the blame rests on the shoulders of George Lucas. Taking over the series' directorial duties for the first time since the original film, he also wrote the script & acted as executive producer. Arguably spreading himself too thin, this also put him in a position where there was no-one to seriously challenge his sometimes questionable choices for the film.Most infamously, the presence of supposedly humorous character Jar Jar Binks was a sore spot for the vast majority of viewers. Reminiscent of a bygone racist caricature, practically everything the character says or does is a source of annoyance. As an attempt at replicating the kind of comic relief supplied by C-3PO & R2-D2 in the original films, Jar Jar Binks is a spectacular failure.Binks is also a prime example of computer generated imagery run amok. Prefiguring some of today's most elaborate special effects extravaganzas, the movie is plastered with often garish CGI environments & characters. Rudimentary as they sometimes were, the special effects of the original trilogy nevertheless felt more real than these more technologically ambitious visuals.The issues with the acting & the script go hand in hand. Apart from the always dependable Liam Neeson, the acting is wooden and unconvincing. Nothing much could reasonably be expected from 10-year old Jake Lloyd but talented co-stars Natalie Portman & Ewan McGregor were hamstrung by uninteresting characterizations and stilted dialogue.

The Outlaw Josey Wales gives audience a full dose of despair almost immediately. We are introduced to Josey Wales, a post-Civil War southerner who is thoroughly disheartened by the atrocities from the war he has witnessed. Refusing to succumb to the northern way of life, Josey continues to provide for his family in the way he has always known. Once tragedy is brought upon the Wales family, Josey retaliates, then quickly adopts a vagabond life as a fugitive on the run. Josey seems quite content to live life as a loner, responsible to and for no one, until he meets a fellow he can't shake. Josey forms a bond with the young man which yields mutually beneficial results as the young man saves Josey's life in a pinch. The tale of vengeance knows no bounds as Wales escapes many seemingly impossible to survive shootouts against those responsible for his despair. Clint Eastwood is the perfect actor for the role of the loner Josey Wales. He is completely believable as a man that needs no one, nor their approval. Even playing a loner, Eastwood's performance is action packed, and intense. Also, the cinematography in this film is breathtaking. Perfect shots of trees and mountains allow the audience to feel like a silent partner, saddling up for Josey's trip. Eastwood, acting as director on this picture as well as star, also uses clean quick cuts throughout each scene, a style that he had perfected through his Dirty Harry series. Aside from the beautiful photography of the film is the starkly gloomy way it is shot. In combination with the score and motion of cuts, a morose mood encompasses the picture. This film was a joy as my introduction to Eastwood westerns, and will doubtfully be the last one I take in.

It's a film that almost requires no introduction on account of its reputation as such a monumental mess of a movie. It's easy to see why it attracted such scorn to be fair as its storyline about a shark that has the ability to follow someone &#x96; presumably via psychic powers &#x96; hundreds of miles, it's beyond ridiculous; while what the shark is precisely seeking revenge for is never fully explained. The great white itself is notable for having the unusual ability to roar like a lion, which is at the very least an unexpected skill given sharks have no vocal chords. But you know what, I consider all of the above nonsense as positive aspects which go in this film's favour. Its sheer ridiculousness kind of makes it so entertaining. The real drawback to Jaws The Revenge in my book was the excessive amounts of tedious melodrama which accounted for the majority of the first two-thirds of the run-time. But whenever the shark popped up to play, things got a lot more agreeable.Famously Michael Caine missed out picking up his Oscar for Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) in order to film one of the re-shot endings for this. The one I saw has Mario Van Peebles character ludicrously survive being pulled down into the depths of the ocean while clamped into the jaws of the shark - he tiresomely re-emerges with a few light scratches and several wise-cracks. The actual destruction of the shark itself was also somewhat unclearly achieved as well but what the hell. It's such a silly film that such issues become relatively moot points by its conclusion. Also of note was the blink-and-you'll-miss-her re-appearance of Lee Fierro reprising her role as Mrs. Kinter, so memorable as the mother of the little boy who was killed on the beach in the first movie, leading to her angry and emotional dockside confrontation with Chief Brody. In this one she now appears to be a friend of the Brody family, so bygones must be bygones.Despite its reputation, I definitely prefer this sequel to the somewhat annoying previous entry, Jaws 3D.

It is the lush emerald scenery, the lush colors, the lush texture of fabrics, the lush succulence of food...this film is a feast for the senses, a sight for sore eyes! With its mixture of the scents of summer and the moist coolness of rain, this is one of the most enchantingly atmospheric films I've ever seen! The cinematography is top-notch. Everything is filmed with the utmost care and patience. The lighting is brilliant! We don't have a conventional plot over here. It's sort of a 'phase' in the life of three sisters. A phase of feeling new things, experiencing new pleasures, realizing the strength of relationships and giving up oneself to the prevalent course of life, each sister rest assured that she can rely on her faith in her other two sisters and her own self-will to surmount all odds. All the characters have been rendered really well by the cast, especially by Tran Nu Yên-Khê who played Lien. The framing of each shot is aesthetically innovative, like when in the end after the three sisters cry on each other's shoulder, there is a shot of their bowed heads with the partings in their hair prominent. I thought that was a really good shot. The music is really nice too. The songs fuse in the life of the characters, becoming entities by themselves.The amazing part of their culture is how well they balance modernity and tradition. If it were not for the tale-tell signs of modernity one would almost be fooled into thinking it to be a period piece. This film reminded me a lot of the beautiful Chinese film 'Postman in the Mountain' directed by Huo Jianqi which is equally good. This film with its emotional subtlety, its studied pace and aesthetic superiority is an unforgettable reminder of the finer things in life and the finest aspects of film, as a medium, in existence.

A phase of feeling new things, experiencing new pleasures, realizing the strength of relationships and giving up oneself to the prevalent course of life, each sister rest assured that she can rely on her faith in her other two sisters and her own self-will to surmount all odds. All the characters have been rendered really well by the cast, especially by Tran Nu Yên-Khê who played Lien. The framing of each shot is aesthetically innovative, like when in the end after the three sisters cry on each other's shoulder, there is a shot of their bowed heads with the partings in their hair prominent. I thought that was a really good shot. The music is really nice too. The songs fuse in the life of the characters, becoming entities by themselves.The amazing part of their culture is how well they balance modernity and tradition. If it were not for the tale-tell signs of modernity one would almost be fooled into thinking it to be a period piece. This film reminded me a lot of the beautiful Chinese film 'Postman in the Mountain' directed by Huo Jianqi which is equally good. This film with its emotional subtlety, its studied pace and aesthetic superiority is an unforgettable reminder of the finer things in life and the finest aspects of film, as a medium, in existence.

It is the classic story of a vampire living up in a creepy castle. The cinematography and lighting are quite well done. Many of the scenes are gloomy and dark, especially those that emphasize Dracula's presence. Some of the scenes may have been a little too dark for my taste. However, the over all feeling of the movie stays true to what you would want and expect. The music matches up nicely, keeping the creepy dark vibe alive through out. I would recommend this film to any fan of the horror genre, and really anyone who appreciates well filmed movies. Not as good or groundbreaking as Frankenstein, but still a solid flick.

Like the cheerful Nazi, rowing his charges to their doom, drowning the cripple, in Lifeboat, here again we see his dark view of life and human beings. Lenny and George are itinerant farm workers who are forced to flee because Lenny, inadvertently, destroys what he loves. His weak, childish mind comes with deadly great physical strength. George is forced to flee with him; as the movie opens they are avoiding another angry mob hot on their trail. Their new work site has all the ingredients for the final tragedy. A cruel, sadistic bosses' son with a bored, wandering wife who takes a fatal interest in Lenny. A dream sustains these sufferers in their trials the farm they will buy someday. Lenny always bugs George to tell it to him to lessen the pain and cruelty of their endless work. Candy, the old worn-out worker, seizes upon their fantasy; after his dog is cruelly taken away from him and shot off camera, he begs them to let him throw in with them and their sad, quixotic plans. That scene is the quintessence of Steinbeck, Candy has but this old crippled, worn out dog. They harass him constantly to let them shoot it. Candy, fearing for his own job, given how old and weak he has become, accedes but immediately recants. It is too late, we hear the gunshot in the background.We see Candy curl up on his bunk, I wish somebody would take me out and shoot me. This is the central motif of Steinbeck the world's hostility and its cruelty towards the old, sick or crippled. We know what is coming, indeed, so does George. Lenny's doom haunts the movie way before it overtakes them all. He simply cannot watch Lenny every single minute. Lenny accidentally crushes a puppy to death, a harbinger of what is to come. We witness Lenny's terrifying physical power when Curley, the cruel boss, provokes him and gets every bone in his hands crushed. Yes, my friends, the plans of mice and men do amount to nothing in this cruel world. Steinbeck makes his point in a powerful fashion. I love the original but really the acting here is far superior. Malkovich and Sinise give their best readings in any movie. Malkovich gives my favorite performance here. Walston, as Candy, also steals all of his scenes. It is dark as night, just like Grapes Of Wrath, but where that ended with a note of hope this one shows us George fleeing on a train eyes filled with anguish for the worst of all duties of a protector destruction.SPOILER George is faced with this horrible Hobbesian choice kill Lenny quickly and mercifully or let the cruel mob get their hands on him. Why should you watch it? Because, if you are most unfortunate in life, this horrible choice will be yours. Soldiers on the battlefield make this choice everyday as we speak. Love, sadly, sometimes commands the most difficult duty of compassion annihilation of the loved. My favorite scene is also the hardest to endure; George tells Lenny to look over at the beautiful stream and tells him a final time about the rabbits he will own someday. He then shoots him quickly and mercifully. The scene shows you that even in destruction love can still be expressed and goodness fulfilled. When we last see him on the train, the pain in his eyes tells us all we need to know about his future. A terribly dark, sad tale that is worthy of viewing; I do not do it often but it is necessary never to hide from the worst side of life. Look the Gorgon in her face, if you do not turn to stone, you will be stronger to be of service as a protector. Steinbeck's lesson is to show you how cruel and unforgiving the world can be and to prepare you for the hardest of all choices. Yet, even in darkest night, the Light can always guide your hands.
