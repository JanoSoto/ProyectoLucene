I haven't seen the movie in about 6 years, but when I did see it; it made me feel like I went back in time to some of the great parties I grew up going to when I was in High School myself. I grew up in Southern California and we had just about every click you could think of in my school, from Surfers, Surf Punks, New Ro's, Anarchist Punks,Mod's, and Goth. So along with all of your normal High School clicks these we're some of the new ones that were added to the bunch, and back then if you belonged to any of these you were definitely different and out-casted in some cases. In other words it wasn't as normal or accepted as it is now a days. So when you talk about reading on how it was back then with true punks or any of these other groups don't try to act as if you are well versed on the lifestyles of the eighties. After what I saw what you wrote it was obvious that you had no clue as to how things were back then. I thought this was a great movie in terms of how it was back then and how so many people changed once they got to high school. (back in those times) To me that's what this movie was all about how everybody went there own ways in school back in the 80s and how it was back in the day. This was a good description of how it was, and I have yet to see another movie close to this describing life in the 80s as a teenager.Of course it was a little different for me because of the people I hung out with. Back then I had the opportunities to hang out with some of these Radio Personalities who are now famous and responsible for bringing a lot of what was the beginning of what Alternative,Techno,Punk and every new sound that was coming out back then.

Michelle and Harrison were absolutely perfect for these roles, I couldn't imagine anyone else in their parts.

They seem like an extremely loving couple and that they have everything under control. But things get scary when Claire starts to hear voices and see ghostly images around the house. Norman thinks she's crazy of course, Claire first suspects her neighbor of murdering his wife, but then she realizes she is wrong and that her husband has a deadly secret that he's kept from her and now it's after her.What Lies Beneath was a great thriller and is a guarantee chill if you watch it at night with the lights turned off. The acting was great and the atmosphere was perfect, the director really had the feel of the film and what it should of been.

The Animated Feature evolved from the Cartoon Short Subject. It was a period of about 30 years or so from the most primitive works like 1906's HUMOROUS PHASES OF FUNNY FACES to Walt Disney's SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS(1937). The animation as an art & science really made the strides, and when it was added to all of the technical achievements in film, like color, sound, etc.,we wound up with a seemingly different thing altogether.The overwhelming success of SNOW WHITE, was achieved in spite of a lot of folks in the Hollywood Establishment and The Press saying it wouldn't work and would not be a favourite at the Box Office. Insteasd of his critics getting to say, I told you so!, it was old Walt who got to do his best Nelson (from THE SIMPSONS) impersonation by giving a loud and clear,Ha Ha! It has been that Mr. Disney had no musical training*, yet possessed a great sense what was good, and what would be the best type or particular pre-existing songs to use in his animated cartoon shorts. Not to rely on his own layman's 'horse sense' kind of judgment, Walt sought counsel in film collaborators, the Host of Many of the Classical Music Radio Broadcasts of Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra, Mr. Deems Taylor. His other chief consultant in these musical matters was, no doubt, was one Mr. Leopold Stokowski who is the on and screen Conductor of his own Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra and, if I may be so bold, was quite a 'Ham' in front of the movie camera.Now the Walt Disney Studio had probably the best equipped, trained and talented group of Artists, Animators and Script Writers in the World. It was a veritable 'Animation Army' and no other company, except maybe Max & Dave Fleischer's, could even compare.So, there would be no problem with doing the stories. Once the number of segments and their lengths were determined, Walt had the horses to deliver the visuals. The animation or moving of the drawn image had already hit its peak several years earlier and the artists & animators would have benefit of such processes as Disney's Exclusive Multi-Plane camera.After the selection of the Classical Pieces to be used and adapted to each of the segments, and story lines developed and assigned to various Disney Animation Teams, it would seem that the job was just about done. Well, it just wasn't true. This greatest of Disney's projects was just getting started.The fundamental problem of 'The Concert Feature' (its working title)was one that really did not plague earlier animated films, at least not to this extent. FANTASIA was being billed as a completely new form of entertainment! It was beginning to live up to that claim.In making this Classical Music and Animated Film feature film, the Disney staff was working with two absolutes. On the one hand the fine application of the stop action photography. The other was the magnificent combination of the fine sounds of the Symphony Orchestra, which combine to give a single, beautiful feast to our auditory nerves, our hearing. This was clearly an exercise in bringing the two widely disparate sensual stimuli.So combining he two should present no new problem. After all the world has had sound movies or Talkies for some time now. There seemed to be no trouble in synchronizing the voice with the lip movement. Any problems in that area had surely been worked out long ago. Talking Pictures were nothing new, and this FANTASIA was surely no different. After all, we had already seen SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS and PINOCCHIO (1940) and they proved to be highly successful and handy at the old Box Office, to boot!But their is no great amount of 'spoken' word by the animated characters. Other than our M.C., Mr. Taylor and a brief sojourn by Mickey Mouse into the Real World, there is none. The synchronization would be that of proper mood and correct movement to be coordinated with the rising and falling of the melodious sound track.Okay, let us concede that it wasn't easy, but the Disney crew did it! They brought about the on screen marriage of the sound and the imagery. But there's one problem left.The object of FANTASIA, as was so explicitly stated by Deems Taylor at the very beginning, was to present the audience with images and stories that were conjured up by the Disney Artists. The story segments would be, in many cases, far different from those of the Composers' original intents. Well, we concede that they succeeded.But there remains one major problem. In the process of making this 'Concert Feature', the production staff was essentially blending opposites in the Symphonic Score with the Bright and Beautiful Moving Images. They succeeded in combining Fire and Water, representing the two elements.But what about the other element, one that these various musicians and scribblers had no control over. And this element is at least as strong as the Images and Music. It is the Power of Imagination, not that of the Creative Team, but that of the Movie Audience. That would be the only obstacle they could not control. And it begs the question, why would anyone want to 'interpret' these musical segments when it will be done by the imagination, anyone's imagination.Please,don't think I disapprove of FANTASIA. To the contrary, I love it (and I've never needed to turn on to view it.) If nothing else, our Uncle Walt brought truly beautiful, Long Hair music to the mass audience of movie-goers.

It's a later Chaplin film, where he's no longer the iconic Tramp, yet in a way the logic of one of those films in terms of the society at large is still being toyed with. This time, instead of being on poverty row with holes in his shoes and a sweet and enduring love for a street girl, he plays a king whose country has gone to war and without many prospects financially comes to America to do commercials for products that he would surely rather not be pushing on the public. As life does imitate art (as far as the stereotype goes it does have a ring of constant truth), Chaplin at the time was an exile, kicked out of America for being a supposed communist, and with his non-prolific career going a little bit on the slide, he made the film as a quasi-light attack on American consumerism, of the vanity and stupidity that can come out of prosperity.But at the same time, there is still the sensibility that Chaplin loves life and individuals, if not certain groups. This can be seen in the child character- one of Chaplin's own sons- who through his very intelligent but arrogant manner is one of the nicer and funniest characters in the film. While a lot of the humor, sometimes rather dry, is in seeing Chaplin's King and his assistant\/butler talk of money problems and in the observations of the 'other', the best scenes come in showing what levels King Shadhov has to sink to in trying to pay his expensive hotel bills and stay afloat in a strange land. My favorite scenes where Shadhov's botched plastic surgery debacle, where it's funnier seeing the King trying not to laugh at a slapstick spectacle than the actual spectacle itself, and the scenes of the King trying to shill the items, often to the dissatisfied directors (I'm reminded of Lost in Translation, and in fact Chaplin's scenes are probably more successful than Coppola's).Although the film is preachy at times- it's best when Chaplin goes for the more succinct jabs as opposed to the grandstanding, ironic since it worked perfectly at the end of the Great Dictator- the overall high-spirited and serenely theatrical direction makes this a worthwhile effort. Far from being the controversial film it got a reputation as following a non-release in the 50s in the US, it's only a cunning satire, with moments light and foreboding, and it deserves to be seen just as much as Chaplin's classics (if only by his fans, who might be apprehensive at the filmmaker making too many 'statements').

Max (Mel Gibson) drives along in his V-8 Interceptor with his dog trying to keep out of trouble & simply survive, gasoline has become the new currency & is in short supply so when Max stumbles upon a small community who refine gasoline & have loads of it he tries to do a deal with them to fill his car up & get as much juice as he can carry. However a gang of thugs & killers lead by Lord Humungus (Kjell Nilsson) want the refinery for themselves & will kill to get it, Max becomes involved & agrees to help the community out...This Autralian production was co-written & directed by George Miller & was the second in the Mad Max trilogy of films & in my humble yet worthwhile opinion is easily the best of the three. The script by Miller, Terry Hayes & Brian Hannant is a fantastic action flick from start to finish, it's a 'pure' & 'raw' action film in the sense there's a simple yet effective story in which the makers have crafted some truly exhilarating stunts & actions scenes around. The character's are surprisingly well developed & fleshed out considering there is actually very little dialogue with Max himself a man of few words, this works well though. The film moves along like a rocket at 95 odd minutes there's barely time to catch your breath before the next explosion or car chase. I loved it from start to finish, the explosions, the car chases, the wanton destruction, the vehicular mayhem, the violence & there's even a very good story here as well. I watched this last night on cable TV & the announcer said 'Now it's Mad Max 2 which contains strong language & violence' then he paused for a few seconds & then in a very self assured voice said 'It's like Waterwolrd but better'! He was right on all counts & this is just an absolute top action film without any one-liners, silly romances or stupid sub plots that get in the way & slow things down.Director Miller obviously used the experience he gained on the original Mad Max (1979) on this sequel & improved everything along with making the explosions bigger & the stunt work better, the stunt work is amazing without any CGI computer effects in sight. Everything was done as a physical stunt on set & it looks brilliant, the final chase with the truck & the gang has to be maybe my favourite vehicle chase ever. There's lots of individual scenes which are just works of art in the action film genre in Mad Max 2, there is also one of the biggest explosions your ever likely to see on film at the end as the compound is blown to (very little) pieces. I don't know how I can praise it more to be honest. Then there's the wonderfully realised post apocalyptic setting, obviously a lot of Australia is a barren wasteland so in that regard it was shot in the right place but the costumes, guns, crossbows & vehicles just look right & haven't dated at all, if Mad Max 2 came out this week it would still look good & futuristic. I'm not sure about the homosexual tone some of the gang members have though. There isn't much graphic violence but there's enough here & the amazing stunt work more than compensates. There is one queasy scene though when Max eats a can of dog food & seems to be enjoying it a little too much...This was apparently the most expensive Australian film made up to that point & it shows with terrific production values. It's very well made with impressive sets & the already mentioned fantastic stunt work. The acting is as what it needs to be, Mel Gibson who wasn't a big star at the time does a decent job.Mad Max 2 is a fantastic old school action flick where stunt men & women actually put their lives on the line to produce some spectacular action scenes unlike these days of course where it's all computer effects so in that regard I doubt we'll see another film like it.

However a gang of thugs & killers lead by Lord Humungus (Kjell Nilsson) want the refinery for themselves & will kill to get it, Max becomes involved & agrees to help the community out...This Autralian production was co-written & directed by George Miller & was the second in the Mad Max trilogy of films & in my humble yet worthwhile opinion is easily the best of the three. The script by Miller, Terry Hayes & Brian Hannant is a fantastic action flick from start to finish, it's a 'pure' & 'raw' action film in the sense there's a simple yet effective story in which the makers have crafted some truly exhilarating stunts & actions scenes around. The character's are surprisingly well developed & fleshed out considering there is actually very little dialogue with Max himself a man of few words, this works well though. The film moves along like a rocket at 95 odd minutes there's barely time to catch your breath before the next explosion or car chase. I loved it from start to finish, the explosions, the car chases, the wanton destruction, the vehicular mayhem, the violence & there's even a very good story here as well. I watched this last night on cable TV & the announcer said 'Now it's Mad Max 2 which contains strong language & violence' then he paused for a few seconds & then in a very self assured voice said 'It's like Waterwolrd but better'! He was right on all counts & this is just an absolute top action film without any one-liners, silly romances or stupid sub plots that get in the way & slow things down.Director Miller obviously used the experience he gained on the original Mad Max (1979) on this sequel & improved everything along with making the explosions bigger & the stunt work better, the stunt work is amazing without any CGI computer effects in sight. Everything was done as a physical stunt on set & it looks brilliant, the final chase with the truck & the gang has to be maybe my favourite vehicle chase ever. There's lots of individual scenes which are just works of art in the action film genre in Mad Max 2, there is also one of the biggest explosions your ever likely to see on film at the end as the compound is blown to (very little) pieces. I don't know how I can praise it more to be honest. Then there's the wonderfully realised post apocalyptic setting, obviously a lot of Australia is a barren wasteland so in that regard it was shot in the right place but the costumes, guns, crossbows & vehicles just look right & haven't dated at all, if Mad Max 2 came out this week it would still look good & futuristic. I'm not sure about the homosexual tone some of the gang members have though. There isn't much graphic violence but there's enough here & the amazing stunt work more than compensates. There is one queasy scene though when Max eats a can of dog food & seems to be enjoying it a little too much...This was apparently the most expensive Australian film made up to that point & it shows with terrific production values. It's very well made with impressive sets & the already mentioned fantastic stunt work. The acting is as what it needs to be, Mel Gibson who wasn't a big star at the time does a decent job.Mad Max 2 is a fantastic old school action flick where stunt men & women actually put their lives on the line to produce some spectacular action scenes unlike these days of course where it's all computer effects so in that regard I doubt we'll see another film like it. Absolutely brilliant & it's one of my all time favourite action films.

This British movie came out near the end of that 90s period, just about the time new drug cocktails were beginning to change the life course of HIV sufferers. The movie is set just before that time, and its gay characters are too familiar with the dying of their community. As one of them here says when challenged by a hospital nurse during a friend's last hours, We've done this before. I first read about this movie in a glowing NY Times review when it received its very limited American release a decade ago, and wished I could see it. Now I have, thanks to Netflix. Though the AIDS epidemic is always in the background, the center of the movie is the unlikely &#150; but all the more believable &#150; relationship between a handsome, sexy young dancer played by Jason Flemyng, and an overweight, alcoholic therapist played by Antony Sher. The actors and the screenwriter take care to help us understand how these two mismatched souls become mates, and in doing so, elicit sympathy for these two deeply flawed individuals. This may have been a low budget indie flick, but it features the virtuoso acting that we so often associate with British thespians, not only from Flemyng and Sher, but in a lovely turn by Dorothy Tutin as a batty old dance company manager who is sinking into dementia even as the younger members of her company are dying off. This all makes the movie sound pretty grim, but in fact it's lively and funny. The movie's chief asset, aside from its performances, is its snappy and sophisticated dialogue by Martin Sherman (who wrote Bent). This is an adult love story, though no one ever says I love you. The two lovers are both painfully imperfect humans, like all of us, who cannot manage their interactions with anything like the smoothness that psychobabble books (or Hollywood movies) suggest they should. Even the therapist who helps other folks manage their traumas cannot manage his own with grace. The highlights of the movie are the sharply written duets between the two protagonists as they navigate their very rocky relationship. My chief reservation about the movie is a plot dive into some sappy melodrama as the dancer's climactic farewell performance approaches, but even so, the movie earns its sentimental wash more than most with the careful, sophisticated development of its characters. I forgave &#150; alright, I even succumbed to &#150; the last act sentimentality. And finally, I can't resist a brief reference to Mr. Flemyng's attractiveness. I first noticed him oozing sex appeal in Stealing Beauty, and then playing the bully villain in Hollow Reed. Alas, in recent years, he seldom seems to turn up on American screens doing anything much worth watching. Pity. He's plenty worth watching in Alive and Kicking.

Death here certainly is a figurative death, the death of passion, of real authenticity, the death of life in such a busy, conventional, conformed, sexual (the adult shop, the trivial question) and fearful society which is filled with blinded, dead people who choose not to be alive. The scene of the coffee shop where Becky (Scarlett Johansson) works shows us a lot. The guy in the wheelchair who later is revealed by Becky that he does so only because he is lazy and who answers the trivial question about an organ, which is slightly above the uterus on the female, to get a free coffee, and a woman who orders the coffee and cuts off Becky's talk to her by starting with the word NO both show us how cold, unfriendly and dead the world is. Everybody is so busy and so caught up with their lives and jobs and personal issues that they just don't care for each other. There are only three people who are alive in the movie but are considered as boring, weird, or even dead people by the society Enid, Seymour, and the old man waiting for the canceled bus. If you look closely the scene in which Enid and Becky talk to the old man, you will notice that the old man blocks out part of the phrase not in service, making it look like NOTICE; and near the left upper corner of the chair there is a word LIFE; both of them making NOTICE LIFE. At the end, Enid, in the red dress, stands right in that position, making the terms appear the same way, NOTICE LIFE. Seemingly, only Enid, Seymour and the old man, despite what others may say, can see and live their lives honestly when others fall into conformity and the certain lifestyles that the society designs for them. Then, at the end, the empty bus serves as the metaphor of the gateway for those people like the old man and Enid to escape to the world they belong rather than living in such a dead world full of ghosts. However, the movie also gives you a second option, which Seymour chooses, is to stay and try to adjust in the dead, structural world. He comes back with his mother and sees the physiologist. That's what you ARE SUPPOSED TO DO when you are old and do not have a wife\/ girlfriend. You have problems. Go to your mother or see the doctor. Enid is brave. She chooses to follow the wise old man, leaving this world and finding her belonging world. The idea of waiting for the bus is also nice. Mostly in life we are so busy going out and looking for something that we really need or want and we can never see it (Enid and Becky's games of following people, and trying to look for something); maybe sometimes, we should just sit down, relax, and then it will come to us. The movie starts off when the girls graduate high school. This is a good start because after high school, people must find for themselves new identities, deserting their old identities\/ lifestyles which were found in high school. Becky stands for all those people. She tries to conform herself. She finds a job, an apartment. She tries to follow the rules at her job (this is just speculation since she is not fired constantly like Enid is) and to fit in. In the coffee shop scene, she tells Enid that you'll get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos and Enid responses that but those are our people and then Becky acts like she is uncomfortable or upset with that idea. Or when they talk about the neighborhood, Enid says This is such a weird neighborhood, and Becky replies This is a totally NORMAL, average neighborhood; Becky no longer sees what Enid sees anymore because they are both so different now. Becky already adapts herself to the dead world; then both of the girls feel alienated from each other. Lastly, the authenticity smeared by the modern world is also the central theme in the movie. The thing that separates Enid from everyone is her sense of authenticity. She hates the obnoxiousness, the phoniness of the people around her who try to conform. When she dyes her hair, she is trying to find back the old true 1977 original punk rock look, not modern punk and Becky, who is already changed, does not get it either like the rest of other people in the shop. Theme about authenticity is also portrayed in the fake authentic fifties diner Wowsville or in the bar in which Seymour and Enid are. The lady Seymour talks to says that if he wants to listen authentic blues, he should listen to Blue Hammers; or the rock band on stage say that they is going to play some authentic blue that is gonna ROCK your world. Or the thing about the poster to show how the society essentially haven't changed that much. People still hate each other but they hide better. There are also many other interesting things in the movie such as Enid is mostly in RED clothes all the time. Red represents for fire, energy, passion, or blood which is vital for life. Again, Enid is the one who is figuratively alive in the movie. Or, Seymour sounds like sees more. So Seymour definitely sees more of the world and himself than Enid does. Or the old, ragged jean on the pavement, or the art class, etc. After all, this is a great movie if you choose to invest your brain energy to it. In fact, all the good movies require thinking and analyzing. GREAT MOVIE!!!

After watching it, I could understand why it has received its fair share of criticism from a good number of fantasy fans, and I wasn't absolutely blown away myself, but certainly couldn't totally trash it like some have. Nothing changed when I watched the movie a second time.A baby girl named Elora Danan is born in the dungeons of the evil Queen Bavmorda, and according to a prophecy, this child will bring the Queen's reign to an end! Aware of this prophecy, Bavmorda plans to have this baby destroyed, but a midwife saves Elora and takes her away in her cradle. When the Queen's Hounds appear, the midwife places the baby in the river before they can reach her. After floating a long distance down the river in her cradle, Elora finally stops by a village of Nelwyns (little people), and is found by the children of Willow Ufgood, a farmer and magician's apprentice in the village. After some persuading, Willow agrees to adopt Elora. Soon, Willow finds himself on a journey, where he is to make sure the prophecy is fulfilled! This movie is over two hours long, so a lot happens in it. Certain plot elements are poorly thought out, such as the scenes with swordsman Madmartigan and the Queen's daughter, Sorsha, some of which don't make a lot of sense. Fortunately, although this kind of thing does lower the quality of the movie a bit, it doesn't ruin the entire thing. Willow has its merits, including some excitement (not as much as there could have been, but still some), as well as occasional funny moments (probably especially the part where Madmartigan, played by Val Kilmer, is introduced). So, if you're a fan medieval fantasy movies, this one isn't guaranteed to blow you away, but it's probably worth a try, and if you start watching and find that you don't like it, well, you can always stop watching.

Nothing changed when I watched the movie a second time.A baby girl named Elora Danan is born in the dungeons of the evil Queen Bavmorda, and according to a prophecy, this child will bring the Queen's reign to an end! Aware of this prophecy, Bavmorda plans to have this baby destroyed, but a midwife saves Elora and takes her away in her cradle. When the Queen's Hounds appear, the midwife places the baby in the river before they can reach her. After floating a long distance down the river in her cradle, Elora finally stops by a village of Nelwyns (little people), and is found by the children of Willow Ufgood, a farmer and magician's apprentice in the village. After some persuading, Willow agrees to adopt Elora. Soon, Willow finds himself on a journey, where he is to make sure the prophecy is fulfilled! This movie is over two hours long, so a lot happens in it. Certain plot elements are poorly thought out, such as the scenes with swordsman Madmartigan and the Queen's daughter, Sorsha, some of which don't make a lot of sense. Fortunately, although this kind of thing does lower the quality of the movie a bit, it doesn't ruin the entire thing. Willow has its merits, including some excitement (not as much as there could have been, but still some), as well as occasional funny moments (probably especially the part where Madmartigan, played by Val Kilmer, is introduced). So, if you're a fan medieval fantasy movies, this one isn't guaranteed to blow you away, but it's probably worth a try, and if you start watching and find that you don't like it, well, you can always stop watching.

Well, it wasn't, but it was something that I've not seen in a long time.Steven McQueen plays this serious kid who finds out about the blob and tries to make everyone believe him and rather failing. It takes a theater of screaming people to wake the people up and make them fight the monster. Maybe one of the first horror movies to place teenagers in a position where they have to convince close-minded adults.Now, the starting theme song is the funniest song ever for a horror movie. I've hummed it obsessively since I've heard it, making me look ridiculous. The blob itself looks like marmalade and Steve's girlfriend seems to have acted well only when he lied the directors that she was an actress. However, the film does have a fresh feeling and the story is fluent and watchable. The end kind of spoils everything, but afterward you can boast you have seen a horror classic.Speaking of the remake it brought everything the original narrowly missed the death of the annoying shop owner, the actual special effects showing people dissolving, the attack in the theater, the phone booth, not to mention a cutey like Shawnee Smith who can actually act a little and a Kevin Dillon that really looked like the rebel Steve was supposed to represent. And then the masterpiece of bringing the corrupt and greedy American Army to get slurped.I would really love to see a good remake of The Blob, but I wouldn't wait until 2018 for it.

It's not supposed to BE a black hole. Produced two years after George Lucas's space opera adventure STAR WARS conquered the box office, this 1979 Disney feature was made as an answer to that film. It was budgeted at a then staggering cost of $20 million, and boasted superior special effects as well as spooky production designs, and to this day they remain among the highest points of THE BLACK HOLE.Which is more than what can be said about the movie as a whole. For a production designed to be an outer space epic, THE BLACK HOLE -- which involves a crew (accompanied by a floating and talking robot, V.I.N.CENT., voiced by an uncredited Roddy McDowall) trapped in an impressively immense vessel called the U.S.S. Cygnus perched dangerously on the edge of the titular mass -- plays out very much like Disney's own 20,000 LAEGUES UNDER THE SEA in space. In particular, the commander of the Cygnus, played with scenery chewing glee by Maximillian Schell, is very reminiscent of James Mason's Captain Nemo from that film, only more ruthless.Contrary to that Disney production about the travels of the Nautilus (and, yes, Lucas's FLASH GORDON-style space romp), however, THE BLACK HOLE is narrowly devoid of many important qualities required to even make it a near classic. The concept of exploring a terrifying force in outer space is an interesting one; however, the script handles it clumsily not only in numerous grievous errors in terms of space logic (Did any of the writers know that you can't survive in outer space with no suit on?) but with the lack of a compelling or interesting narrative to drive the whole show by. In particular, the secret revelation about the Cygnus and its captain are not hard to guess.Incidentally, although Disney commissioned a high-profile cast with names such as Schell, McDowell, and PSYCHO's Anthony Perkins, few turn in anything in the way of an inspired performance (Schell and McDowell fare best, but Perkins, along with his co-stars, is surprisingly stiff and lifeless). As such, the audience does not connect with the crew or even feel more hatred for the villain, despite Schell's commanding performance.The only characters to rise above this exception are the robots, particularly McDowell as the heroic and kitschily named V.I.N.CENT and Schell's ominous, scarlet-colored giant dubbed, funnily enough, Maximillian. Although much of the dialogue V.I.N.CENT spouts consists of groan-worthy one-liners, he and his companion, battered up Old B.O.B., liven up the screen with more personality than their human counterparts. (Although there are those who found them to be pretty cloying; my real issue is that they look like Fisher-Price toys!) And of course, Maximillian is a very formidable villain, his presence invoking terror to the audience. That he doesn't say one word in the film makes him all the more menacing.It is widely agreed by many that the special effects I mentioned earlier are what hold THE BLACK HOLE together, although some of them reek of age, particularly some bad matte painting, but aside from that and the robots, the only other positive is the foreboding musical score provided by John Barry. Although repetitive at times, it suits the dark tone of the film very well and is hard to forget.The real problem with THE BLACK HOLE is that it's droningly dull for more than two-thirds of its ninety-something minute running time. Much of that time is spent exploring the Cygnus with the cast spouting stiff, uninspired dialogue. Things finally pick up in the latter third, but again, there are some serious flaws in the conception of several action scenes. Most notably ridiculous is when a giant asteroid crashes through the hull and rolls down a massive hallway. While this sequence is very memorable, it only serves as yet another example of the incompetence of the writers' lack of knowledge about outer space.When everyone finally descends into the black hole itself, we get a disturbing and powerful sequence involving Heaven and Hell. It's surreal and vaguely similar to the climax of Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY, but while it's an engrossing highlight, the whole sequence comes completely out of nowhere. Worse still, it sadly undermines the epic premise and provides for a very baffling and frustratingly unexplained conclusion.The special effects, robots, and music prevent THE BLACK HOLE from being a complete waste of time, but considering how this movie was Disney's response to STAR WARS, it's unfortunate that it fails to provide even a spark of excitement. Had it been in more experienced hands, who knows how THE BLACK HOLE would have turned out? As it stands as a whole, however, it's only so-so.

Jump cuts are over-used, and seem out of place in terms of the feel and period setting of the film. Less obtrusive craftsmanship would allow the audience to give the story the full attention it deserves.

When the typist arrives, full of hero worship, she discovers he has two days to finish and deliver a completed script -- and all he has is the title The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower. Though Paris is all about how the two write the screenplay, this is not a movie about the throes of creation (any more than another comedy about a writer, Throw momma from the Train.) The problem with movies about writers is that a writer's life consists of sitting around staring at the blank pages in the typewriter (then) or a blank computer screen (now). Usually some outside element has to be introduced to make a movie about a writer interesting. Paris makes the process of writing the screenplay a surrogate for wooing, as the increasingly desperate (and amorous) Holden dictates to Hepburn (who, as an aspiring writer, offers a few suggestions of her own). What makes this movie more a fantasy than a romantic comedy is that the movie they are writing -- The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower -- plays out on-screen, with Holden and Hepburn taking the leads.It must have looked really good on paper. And some of it plays well (as when Holden, after dictating the plot of his movie changes his mind and starts again from an earlier scene, making the movie-within-a-movie rewind). It's all good fun, the way these two people who are falling in love and refuse to admit it, preferring to play out their fantasies in the film they are writing. Holden and Hepburn are perfectly charming doing it.Unfortunately, the movie they're writing is too silly for words. If this is the stuff Holden cranks out for a living, it's a wonder he's rich and famous (are any movie writers rich and\/or famous?) There is some good stuff here. An unbilled Tony Curtis (a major star at the time) is a delight as he makes repeated and unflattering appearances in The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower. Curtis had made comedies (Some Like it Hot) but was coming off several serious movies (Taras Bulba, 'The Outsider, The Great Impostor) when he was slipped into Paris when it Sizzles. This movie seems to mark Curtis' slide into increasingly inconsequential 60s comedies.More often, Paris When it Sizzles fizzles as it makes the mistake of the sillier 1960s comedies. For instance, at a wild party (a must in the more inane comedies of the period) Mel Ferrer, who everyone at the time knew as Audrey Hepburn's husband, as well as a big-screen actor in his own right, makes an unbilled cameo playing Dr. Jekyll. There's no rhyme or reason to his appearance, other than to give a giggle to readers of Photoplay at the appearance of Hepburn's hubbie. Yet someone must have thought Ferrer's mere appearance would have had the audience rolling in the aisles.Paris possibly helped inspire that sort of 1960s wackiness where film-makers thought simply being silly for the sake of silliness, apropos of nothing, with a twist of pseudo-psychedelicness, would prove funny. What's New Pussycat, Casino Royale and other nonsense ensued.Hepburn didn't like the finished flick, and Holden may well have had this movie in mind when he wondered if acting was any way for a grown man to make a living; but Paris slips under the wire as a success on the star power of Holden, Hepburn and Curtis (and a billed appearance by Noel Coward, who was a grand old man of entertainment at that time, though he's too old here to show why). Even with all that star power the movie sometimes seems to be running on fumes, especially when it gets just a smidge too silly. But it never tries to be anything other than what it is. It has no pretensions. It simply is; and if you like silliness, and big movie stars acting like children, and don't want to watch a movie that makes you think much, you might enjoy this stuff.One word about the romance angle. Much is made about the age difference between Holden and Hepburn. It's only eleven years. Hepburn was thirty-five or so at the time, while Holden was yet on the sunny side of fifty. But Holden is beginning to show wear (especially when he dons his glasses) while Hepburn (possibly due to ingenious makeup) looks fresh as a daisy. Obviously Hepburn isn't playing a thirty-five-year-old. But they're both adults and they seem to be enjoying themselves.The biggest puzzle is the title. It seems like a better title would be The Girl Who Stole the Eiffel Tower. But I suppose that might mislead some people into thinking it was a tense, Hitchcockian mystery.

In some ways, this Bonder can be viewed as a final chapter in the saga of Felix Leiter, Bond's CIA liaison, who was introduced way back in the 1st one (Dr.No). He's played here by actor Hedison, the only actor returning for a 2nd go-around as Leiter (after Live and Let Die). He's getting married at the start of this one and Bond is his best man; the wedding is delayed briefly when the two agents make it their business to arrest drug lord Sanchez, who had slipped into Florida for some R&R, such as cutting out hearts. This teaser and then the wedding lend a humanistic tone to the Bond saga, something we'd noted in Dalton's previous effort The Living Daylights, and which we'd only seen briefly back in On Her Majesty's Secret Service a full 20 years earlier. So, it's not as if we've had time to become accustomed to such a tone - Bond is better known as the invulnerable super-agent, perhaps not laughing in the face of death but at least shrugging it off. But, the kicker is, if we had to pick the one Bond actor to go renegade on us - to have his license revoked and go off on a personal mission of vengeance - it would have to be Dalton. I certainly can't picture Moore in this role; Connery - maybe, and possibly Lazenby. But, Moore? He'd find some way to retain his license to kill and sneak away while 'on leave' or some such thing. Of course, the newest Bond, Craig, has the same rebellious qualities which we see here, but he didn't show up until almost 20 years after this one and he played a younger, untried version.This one also marked Dalton's last stab at Bond after only a duo of films and also features the last versions of M and Moneypenny that we see here. Q would show up in a few more of the Brosnan films; his role is again expanded here (as in Octopussy), having him take an active part in the unauthorized mission, confirming what we'd always suspected - he's the uncle figure to Bond, where-as M is the stern father figure. The scene of Q showing up with his latest bag of gadgets reminds me of an old relative arriving in time for Christmas with a bag of goodies for the kids. This Bonder has a few such nice touches, suggesting family and friendship; there's even mention of Bond's deceased wife. But, the strongest element is friendship - Bond probably doesn't have too many true friends (they tend to die prematurely, for one thing), so when a couple of them are dealt with brutally, he takes personal offense. This passion Dalton displays, subverted into relentless revenge, works within the confines of this off kilter Bonder; it seemed like a Die Hard-type thriller when it was released, Americanized and certainly not Bondish, upsetting many fans at the time of release. However, time has been kind to this one, much like On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and it can be looked upon now as just a different, darker approach among the 20+ Bonders to date - the one where Bond dishes out payback for himself and a friend, not for Queen and Country. There's an escalation of the usual violence - some of the deaths are particularly grisly for a Bonder - including a return to the use of sharks, which seem to pop up in every few Bonders.The vendetta, uh, mission takes him to Isthmus City down in South America, where, again, it appears as if we've entered some Scarface domain, not the Bond universe. Bond somewhat infiltrates Sanchez' organization, consisting of sadistic henchmen and opportunistic sleazeballs. As before, Dalton as Bond seems always surrounded by visceral danger and frightening threats - you can tell this guy's more than a bit nervous in some scenes - and inadvertently causes the deaths of other white hats. There's chasing on the water, in the air and, in the climax, on some narrow roads, where we we see some unlikely stunts using tanker trucks - but this is when we're reminded it is a Bond thriller, after all; most of these are exciting and spectacular. You also gotta hand it to actor Davi, who creates a memorable villain as the ruthless, VERY sadistic and, ultimately paranoid Sanchez. In a nod to previous Bond villains, the filmmakers even have a lizard perched on Sanchez' shoulder in one scene, to make sure we understand who we're dealing with. But, Davi manages, by the end, to convey that his killer is not just about the money (in fact, he cares less and less about the bucks as the story proceeds) - he enjoys the thrill of the kill, the passion, if you will, of evil, to counterpoint Bond's drive for cold justice. Therefore, his demise is particularly satisfying and marked the end of the eighties preoccupation with wealth, to boot. The two femme fatales are uneven in their performances; both end up on Bond's side and neither is a good fit for him. Bond would return only six years later in Goldeneye - Dalton would not.
