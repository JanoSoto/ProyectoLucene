I had extremely high expectations for this film &#150; maybe because this film deserves such high expectations from younger audiences. Casablanca is about Rick (Humphrey Bogart), a nightclub owner who is a lonely man and has a life filled with one-night stands and glasses of wine. He does not want to be attached to anything personally or politically, but he has receive hold of two transit letters. Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), who is a Czech nationalist writer and his wife, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) has come to Rick's in search of exit visas because on their way to America, they must arrive at Casablanca first, and visas are hard to come by. Surprisingly, Rick and Ilsa were former lovers who met in Paris, and Ilsa was also the only woman Rick has ever loved. Their relationship ended when Rick flees the city from German armies and the plan was that they leave together. When Ilsa did not come to the train station, Rick left without Ilsa and hasn't seen her since. Rick is both angry and frustrated when he sees Ilsa, but he finds out that he still really loves her and might be also willing to help her and her husband.One of the great things about Casablanca is that it has a great story, rich in detail and is nicely done. This is why it is often cited as one of the Best Films Ever Made. Not only that is flourishes with romance but, it transforms into a worthy epic that moves quickly along the plot. As we watch the film, we find that Rick and Ilsa still love each other very much and are perfect for each other, but the two searches for the right thing to do, which is probably the hardest thing for both of them to do. They must leave each other because that is what is best for them.The problem in this film is that everything happens quickly. (Yes, I complain about Lost in Translation being too slow but now I'm complaining that Casablanca is too quick &#150; how the heck can people please me?) This is one of the films that I wished that just went a little longer and maybe &#150; just maybe &#150; I would be pleased. I also wished the plot delve deeper into the characters because apparently, the flashback scene of Rick and Ilsa wasn't enough for me. I wished the story explored the characters a bit more, but of course, I think Ingrid Bergman's drop of tear coming from the edge of her eyes is quite enough for the film.The performances are really good. I don't think any modern movie stars can really compete with Bogart and Bergman. They are fantastic together. There is also Henreid, who has terrific scenes in the film. Conrad Veidt, who plays Strasser whose only goal is to capture Laszlo and is far more than the typical Nazi villain. Claude Rains plays Louis, who has always secured his and Rick's friendship (Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.). There is of course, Dooley Wilson, who played Sam and I think one of my favorite songs of all time has to be As Time Goes By. I really enjoyed this film. I don't love it as much as I thought I would, but I really enjoyed it. Casablanca is often compared to Gone with the Wind and unfortunately, I think I still like Gone with the Wind a lot better. Casablanca is gorgeous for a black-and-white film. (But face it, all black-and-white films are gorgeous.) The ending closes with some promise of a world of less regrets, but more memories. It is nice to know that Rick and Ilsa will always have Paris and Casablanca.

It turned out that the audience watching this on the suburban main street cinema in St-Lambert, Quebec, were for the most part dumbfounded. Here was a film about a scriptwriter writing a script and altering the story as he went along in order to fulfill a mercenary obligation to create the most fulfilling, popcorn-selling entertainment possible, spoofing every movie convention in the process, out-Stanley-Donen-ing Donen's Charade, which was itself an attempt to out-Hitchcock Hitchcock's films. It was brainy, satirical, cynical and the first obvious deconstruction of what makes movies tick. Being a remake of a French 1952 film by Julien Duvivier (scripted by cinema pioneer Henri Jeanson) called La Fête à Henriette made it even more derivative. Being scripted by George Axelrod (of Manchurian Candidate fame) made it challenging. Unfortunately, trying to salvage the film itself with the oldest movie cliché of them all - the redemptive power of love - made the happy ending definitely tongue-in-cheek and a tad less than sincere. But then there was so much to fill the viewer's time between the outrageous premise and the outrageous ending, it can be said that the thoughtful film-fan did get more than his money's worth. One of my favourite scenes is near the end, when the hero punches the heroine's boyfriend in public, which triggers a series of imitative violent acts in the impressionable public - including two Parisian kids starting a fight. What better illustration of the power of (American) movie violence to modify its audience's behaviour? So, which is it, silly entertainment or thoughtful thesis about the power of the narrative and of its many accepted conventions? Whatever you think of this film, it is at least partly responsible for the creation of the sixties pull-all-the stops, over-the top satirical-and-socially-conscious school of absurdist comedy which ran the gamut from Laugh-In and The Monkees on TV to manic but oh-so-hip-for-the-times movies like Don't Make Waves, Lord Love A Duck, Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feeling so Sad, Candy and The Magic Christian.P.S.

Bunuel in particular used his unique imagery to make oblique satires of government and religion and the bourgeoisie; he also had a wicked sense of humor.

It is amazing what of the film I retained in memory. Most of what I remembered was the sheer brilliance of Paul Newman. In seeing it the second time, I'm 24 years older, I've worked for attorneys, I've had an experience with the justice system. And still, what I take away from The Verdict is the sheer brilliance of Paul Newman. After Matthew McConnaughey made A Time to Kill, he asked his agents if he could meet Paul Newman. I guess someone told him they were similar. Newman said to him, This is a time to not take yourself seriously and your work very seriously. When Matthew McConnaughey has a 50+ year career, you'll talk (I'll be gone) - but it's evident that Paul Newman takes his work very seriously indeed.The Verdict is an old story - the drunken attorney who takes a case -think The People Against O'Hara for one - but this one has a stunning cast which includes Jack Warden, James Mason, Charlotte Rampling and Lindsay Crouse. And it asks one of life's great questions - what do you do when losing is just not an option? Drunken, disillusioned, ambulance-chasing Frank Galvin takes a slam-dunk hospital negligence case thrown to him by an investigator friend (Warden). His expert witness tells him he can win. So Galvin doesn't tell his client about a lowball offer, takes the thing to trial, loses his star witness, hires a pathetic expert, is reported by his client for failing to give them the offer they would have happily taken - simply put, there's no paddle but if he doesn't get down the river, any hope of reconstituting his life is over. Gone. David Mamet's script stacks everything against Frank but when you're fighting for your life, failure is not an option.Newman is a wonder with his loser posture and hyperventilation and his desperateness. It's in his voice, it's on his face, it's in his smile, it's in his shaking hands. He's up against James Mason and his huge law firm, a smug, well-dressed bunch who will stop at nothing to win. One might think this type of firm is a cliché; it isn't. One of the characters says it best - You have no loyalty to anyone, you don't care who you hurt. You're all whores. Unfortunately in real life, all attorneys are pretty much the same, but at least in film we occasionally are shown a decent one. When this film was made, the public had not yet been subjected to the Dream Team, the Robert Blake Case, the Menendez Brothers. But even today, knowing better, you can't help but buy into Newman's frantic sincerity.The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent, with top honors going to Mason's smooth Concannon and Lindsay Crouse, who gives us the most powerful five minutes of the film with her magnificent performance as the admission nurse.Is it a manipulative film? As hell. Is it feel good? You betcha. But take it from someone who knows an unfortunate truth - that justice is for the rich who pull in favors and have the money to fight, everyone lies their teeth off, and the jury system is sad - if I can be swept away by The Verdict and by Paul Newman's performance (another Oscar he was cheated out of) - you're gonna eat it up.

When Matthew McConnaughey has a 50+ year career, you'll talk (I'll be gone) - but it's evident that Paul Newman takes his work very seriously indeed.The Verdict is an old story - the drunken attorney who takes a case -think The People Against O'Hara for one - but this one has a stunning cast which includes Jack Warden, James Mason, Charlotte Rampling and Lindsay Crouse. And it asks one of life's great questions - what do you do when losing is just not an option? Drunken, disillusioned, ambulance-chasing Frank Galvin takes a slam-dunk hospital negligence case thrown to him by an investigator friend (Warden). His expert witness tells him he can win. So Galvin doesn't tell his client about a lowball offer, takes the thing to trial, loses his star witness, hires a pathetic expert, is reported by his client for failing to give them the offer they would have happily taken - simply put, there's no paddle but if he doesn't get down the river, any hope of reconstituting his life is over. Gone. David Mamet's script stacks everything against Frank but when you're fighting for your life, failure is not an option.Newman is a wonder with his loser posture and hyperventilation and his desperateness. It's in his voice, it's on his face, it's in his smile, it's in his shaking hands. He's up against James Mason and his huge law firm, a smug, well-dressed bunch who will stop at nothing to win. One might think this type of firm is a cliché; it isn't. One of the characters says it best - You have no loyalty to anyone, you don't care who you hurt. You're all whores. Unfortunately in real life, all attorneys are pretty much the same, but at least in film we occasionally are shown a decent one. When this film was made, the public had not yet been subjected to the Dream Team, the Robert Blake Case, the Menendez Brothers. But even today, knowing better, you can't help but buy into Newman's frantic sincerity.The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent, with top honors going to Mason's smooth Concannon and Lindsay Crouse, who gives us the most powerful five minutes of the film with her magnificent performance as the admission nurse.Is it a manipulative film? As hell. Is it feel good? You betcha. But take it from someone who knows an unfortunate truth - that justice is for the rich who pull in favors and have the money to fight, everyone lies their teeth off, and the jury system is sad - if I can be swept away by The Verdict and by Paul Newman's performance (another Oscar he was cheated out of) - you're gonna eat it up.

All the characters are great, and the story is pretty good as well, plus Nicolas Cage is simply amazing in this!. While it did take a little while to get going, it was always entertaining, and Nicolas Cage proves once more that he can play a top notch Action hero, plus I haven't seen the original but Really enjoyed this remake. One of my favorite stunts is when cage uses the Mustang (Elanora) and is all surrounded by Cop cars, he decides to do a big jump, as that was really cool, and I have to say I enjoyed this more then Fast And The Furious(even though that was pretty good too), plus it's pretty well made and written as well. I also loved how Cage drove in reverse to avoid getting nailed by this huge truck, and Angelina Jolie isn't too shabby in her role, plus I really dug the ending, as it was quite cool!. It's basically brainless entertainment but great brainless entertainment, and Christopher Eccleston played a pretty good villain, plus it's often quite tense at times. This is a great Car theft film, that's really quite entertaining, with some wicked Car chases, and fun performances all around, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great!. Dominic Sena does a great! Job here with very good camera work, awesome angles, and lots of other cool shots as well, plus he kept the film at a very fast pace. The Acting is a lot of fun!. Nicolas Cage is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is a major bad ass, looked damn cool, was extremely likable, had good chemistry with Duvall, Jolie and Ribisi, proved he is good at being an action hero too, brought lots of charisma,as he was so convincing! (Cage Rules!!!!!!!). Giovanni Ribisi is excellent playing Cage's younger brother Kip, he was likable, and you root for Cage to get him out of danger,although sometimes he was a bit too low key, but that's a minor thing. Angelina Jolie didn't have all that much to do but did what she had to rather well, she was also really quite sexy, as I'm not overly fussed on her as other people are, but I dug her here, maybe there is something to her after all. Will Patton is great as Watley, he had a cool character I really dug him. Delroy Lindo is always a plus in any film he's in here is no different he played another awesome Cop role!. Timothy Olyphant is usually awesome but disappointed me here, as he was too restrained, he still had a couple of good scenes though. Christopher Eccleston is pretty good as the villain he was menacing and did a good job. Robert Duvall is fantastic as always and did just fine in his role, I just wished he had more screen time. Chi McBride is funny here in his role he was good. Rest of the cast are fine.

It is an intriguing choice for a character who had earlier stated to her husband You don't love me. I am something you have caught. Some kind of wild animal you have trapped. Aware of this, the young lady who has so far fooled a lot of rich men and escaped the law, prefers marriage to jail. She is smart, a woman who embezzles her employers to buy rich gifts for her mother, aware of modesty in dress (keeps pulling her skirt over her knees) and a convincing liar. Like Notorious, the marriage is one of convenience, or so it appears&#151;the end of the film is open-ended.For those who are not aware of it, Hitchcock fired the initial scriptwriter (a male), who honestly felt the rape of the wife by the husband was out character with male lead played by Sean Connery. The replaced scriptwriter (a lady) wrote the sequence which was used, in a suggestive way rather than a graphic way. Hitchcock loved to slip in sex even if it was out of character. Lesbianism is suggested by the husband's sister-in-law's remark What a dish! a remark one would associate from the opposite sex. (Hitchcock similarly played with homosexuality in Rope). A critical scene that could be mistaken for child molestation was probably an innocent gesture mistaken by the mother.Hitchcock usually was attentive to visuals and sound. This is an unusual film where the director swings from one extreme of high sophistication to absolute stupidity. The opening shots of the woman walking away with the yellow handbag are stunning.

Close attention to faces, like Hitchcock or Scorsese. You feel like you know these people and feel the pain they feel, with not much screen time. That's a credit to both the leads, but even the bit players manage to convey a lot with little time.Unlike some reviewers I find the transformation of the main character, Hoskins (spoiler follows!), quite believable. This is a mind controlled by rituals and symbols, and he already knows that Felicia is not like his other victims, because she came willingly into his house. He seems to regret what he's about to do, and he admits when pressed by the evangelists that he's not a good man, and that he stole her money to keep her close to him. Had she cried out or been rescued by them, it would have been a hackneyed chance ending. Having him open the door, accept the redemption promised by the Christians, and having her stare a long last stare at him before departing, seems to me the perfect ending. She makes a choice rather than panicking, and this seems to render her calm at the epilogue believable and refreshing. Like anyone who's been through a terrible trauma, even (in her mind the abortion is) complicit in one, they learn to re-form their identity around events and cope. He (Hoskins) killed her unborn child as he killed those other women. She was a witness, merely. She does not condemn herself for falling for his lies. Nor even condemn him. He's just a sick thing, best out of the world and on to accepting the redemption of the next, before he can do more harm, before he can recant. All of this makes sense from her (more religious) and his (more desperate) point of view. It's a great ending. I don't know why anyone would consider it rushed, unnatural or whatever. Hoskins' character himself comments on the chance events that cause outcomes to occur very differently. For instance, if Felicia were to turn her head in the pub, she'd see her man. But she doesn't. This alone determines the fate of her child. Or if she were not kicked out of the hostel, she would not have returned to his house. And so on. I don't think a story like this is problematic for ending on yet another turn of fate. In many ways, the story is about exactly that kind of turn, and Hoskins' character seems formed by many such turns himself - mostly wrong ones. Except at the end, where he makes the right choice.It's almost as if Egoyan is commenting on the fragility of lives led by rituals and symbols, and how chaotic our lives become if we get tied up with those who lose track of empathy as their moral guide. How sad that is. Hoskins' return to his boyhood, in black and white, at his own end, demonstrates how lonely his life has been outside the rituals and symbols of his mother's cooking show. Makes me shudder at child stars.

","genre":"Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"1 April 2006","score":"","review":" Egoyan's visual skills make this a really wonderful film to watch The painfully slow pans, worthy of Kurosawa, and detail-filled backgrounds, like Ridley Scott without the overload. Close attention to faces, like Hitchcock or Scorsese. You feel like you know these people and feel the pain they feel, with not much screen time. That's a credit to both the leads, but even the bit players manage to convey a lot with little time.Unlike some reviewers I find the transformation of the main character, Hoskins (spoiler follows!), quite believable. This is a mind controlled by rituals and symbols, and he already knows that Felicia is not like his other victims, because she came willingly into his house. He seems to regret what he's about to do, and he admits when pressed by the evangelists that he's not a good man, and that he stole her money to keep her close to him. Had she cried out or been rescued by them, it would have been a hackneyed chance ending. Having him open the door, accept the redemption promised by the Christians, and having her stare a long last stare at him before departing, seems to me the perfect ending. She makes a choice rather than panicking, and this seems to render her calm at the epilogue believable and refreshing. Like anyone who's been through a terrible trauma, even (in her mind the abortion is) complicit in one, they learn to re-form their identity around events and cope. He (Hoskins) killed her unborn child as he killed those other women. She was a witness, merely. She does not condemn herself for falling for his lies. Nor even condemn him. He's just a sick thing, best out of the world and on to accepting the redemption of the next, before he can do more harm, before he can recant. All of this makes sense from her (more religious) and his (more desperate) point of view. It's a great ending. I don't know why anyone would consider it rushed, unnatural or whatever. Hoskins' character himself comments on the chance events that cause outcomes to occur very differently. For instance, if Felicia were to turn her head in the pub, she'd see her man. But she doesn't. This alone determines the fate of her child. Or if she were not kicked out of the hostel, she would not have returned to his house. And so on. I don't think a story like this is problematic for ending on yet another turn of fate.

When this happens I usually attribute it to poor diction by the cast members. This would be very difficult to do in the case of Twelfth Night which has a uniformly excellent cast. Nevertheless my experience is that this problem is always exacerbated during the performance of any classic work which has been significantly transposed in either space of time, and I therefore do not generally enthuse about productions featuring Shakespearean plays as contemporary works. This film of Twelfth Night is actually set in the nineteenth century, and is also geographically transposed from Illyria to what is clearly Cornwall. Unfortunately I personally found this to be even more confusing than a completely contemporary performance. With Shakespeare in modern dress, one must accept the cast travelling by automobile or aeroplane and using modern electronic equipment, but here we have a period piece where the sixteenth century dialogue is spoken by actors in nineteenth century attire and interspersed by the playing of modern musical instruments and games, the use of period firearms, the riding of bicycles, and travel by stagecoach. For me such changes created great incongruities which destroyed the illusion of reality that all dramatic works have to try to create, and thus made the plot even more difficult to follow. So I am sorry but I cannot share the enthusiasm of many other viewers whose comments are recorded here.That said, I must acknowledge that the performances are outstanding and the play flows in a way which many more traditional versions do not. Twelfth Night is one of Shakespeare's finest plays, with many complex characters who can constantly surprise the audience without in any way derailing the ongoing comedy, and this makes the play a joy to watch. Unfortunately only too often this comedy is reduced to near slapstick, which completely hides the depth Shakespeare wrote into most of the characters he created. Nunn's presentation is one of the best I have seen for gradually revealing these unexpected facets of character as his (greatly shortened) play develops. The longer I watched it the more at home I felt, and the nearer I came to at last being drawn into the performance. I can readily understand that those who do not share the reservations I have expressed above would be likely to rate this film very highly. In particular the performances of Ben Kingsley as Feste and of Helen Bonham Carter as Olivia are of award winning quality. The photography is also delightful, and the film shows none of the blips in continuity that so often take place when a heavily cut play by Shakespeare is filmed. Overall I have rated this film at 5 stars; but readers of these comments should recognise that I would have liked to give it a higher rating if only I had been able to forget occasionally that I was watching actors playing rather strange and hybrid parts.

Kurtz's memory - any more than being back in Saigon was an accident. There is no way to tell his story without telling my own. And if his story really is a confession, then so is mine. Shoot, who wrote the narration? Because those are pretty classic lines. Make a good Sig but it has to be under a hundred characters. Here's something probably under a 100 charging a man with murder in this place was like handing out speeding tickets in the Indy 500. He is sent up with Chef (Fredrick Forrest), Mr. Clean (a 14 year old Larry Fishburne), Lance (Sam Bottoms) and Chief (Albert Hall), who are all (except Chief) young and inexperienced soldiers. In the films most famous scene, they are chauffeured to the mouth of their river by Robert Duvall and his air Calvary, who bomb a Vietnamese village to clear the area for surfing. The famous detail is that the helicopters are blasting Wagners Ride of the Valkeries as they attack the village.From there the film descends, one scene after another, into a world of chaotic insanity and madness. One of the most memorable scenes is when they pass the last American outpost on the river. Soldiers carrying suitcases swim into the river desperately, crying out take me home! When Willard goes onto the crazily lit bridge (we only see his face every time a flare goes up) he asks a soldier who the commanding officer is. The soldier looks horrified and replies Aint you? Finally, the film reaches the end of the river. Only a couple of the men are left. Men hang from the trees and skulls decorate the sides of the river. Heads and severed limbs and graffiti (one which says Apocalypse Now) cover the ancient temple. The beret, Kurtz (played by Marlon Brando) recites poetry and Willard is disturbed to discover the many parallels between him and Kurtz. Kurtz's biggest admirer is The Photojournalist played by Dennis Hopper, who says things like You don't talk to the Colonel. You listen to him...he's a poet-warrior in the classic sense. This is a stunning film to watch, and what is more stunning I can see this again and again and again and never get bored of it.Original or Redux? There isn't much difference between the two versions. You might want to see Redux for an interesting new way to look at the film (the scenes have been rearranged into a different order) but I would see the original first, which stays closer to the novel on which the film is based, Conrad's Heart of Darkness.Arresting a man for murder in this place was like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500...good line.

They are written in no order) I'm not sure if there could possibly be a more fitting title for this film than Apocalypse Now. The famous opening scene shows a line of trees for about a minute as we hear helicopters chop-chopping in and out of the frame. We begin to hear the first notes to The Doors' The End and as the first words are spoken the entire forest is hit by napalm and bursts into flame silently. Then it fades on one half of the screen to a shot of Martin Sheen's face, and the helicopters are really the ceiling fan? And all the children, are insane! All the children... The first lines spoken in the film is Sheen narrating Saigon. (expleteive). I'm still only in Saigon. He continues to narrate his life story. How he fought in Vietnam, went home. Couldn't stand being away from the jungle. Only word he said to his wife was yes to a divorce. And now he was back here. Still only in Saigon. Every minute I stay in this room, I get weaker, and every minute Charlie squats in the bush, he gets stronger. Each time I looked around, the walls moved in a little tighter. Sheen, drunk, tears apart his room and cuts himself punching a mirror. Having fun yet? The next morning he is in luck - HQ gives him a top secret mission up the river into Cambodia, to kill a Green Beret colonel who has lost his mind and commands his soldiers to commit atrocities while they worship him as a king. Willard narrates I was going to the worst place in the world and I didn't even know it yet.

After an amazing run of films (Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart, and Fire Walk With Me), Lynch unleashed his worst creation yet on an unsuspecting public. And yet Lost Highway should have been his pinnacle! Bill Pullman! Robert Loggia! Robert Blake as the Devil (sort of)! Balthazar Getty! Patricia Arquette! What a cast and what an intriguing premise--man maybe kills his wife who may not actually be dead but then becomes someone else in prison. It's like Hitchcock and Luis Bunuel made a movie together. But Lost Highway doesn't even come close to living up to expectations. Why? Simply put It's soulless. It honestly feels as though Lynch was going through the motions, picking up ideas from his past films and putting them to use in a different setting. He aims for a convoluted narrative and gets it; he searches the dream world for inspiration but comes up wanting. The story, with its dichotomous nature, should work better than it does, but the use of the two leads doesn't really add anything to the film. And, frankly, Bergman did the two actors as the same character thing better in Persona. And Hitchcock's Vertigo gives you a better I thought you were dead woman than Lost Highway. Most of Lynch's films play with conventions and ideas that are clearly connected to earlier films; Lost Highway feels derivative. The best part of the film, from my perspective, is the thoroughly creepy Robert Blake. Lynch's films inevitably have great bogeymen and the Blake character is no exception. He's eerie and frightening. I was 17 when I saw this film in 1997 and I had nightmares. The rest of the film pales (no pun intended) in comparison to Blake. However, here's the caveat Watch this movie. If you've never seen a Lynch film, don't start here. If you like the man's work, though, make sure you see it. It's a polarizing film and one that certain people actually like. It's also definitely better a fascinating trainwreck of a picture.

He then gets off the train only to find the station is barricaded, so he trys to find a new route. He does make it home, but things have been changing. He's been having visions of his tour of Vietnam, and they all seem weird as he does not remember them. Eventually he starts to see more weird things, people, or creatures are hunting him down. He tries to find more information from the army- but the army denies all, even that he was ever in the Vietnam war. He gets a call from an old army buddy, who is freaking out. Saying he's going to hell, that they're coming for him. After the meeting, his car explodes taking his life. Strange things continue to occur up until Jacob is injured. He is then dragged through a seemingly hellish hospital, where they tell him he is dead and experiment. He wakes up to be rushed out by his chiropractor (A seemingly angelic character) who heals his injury and gives Jacob advice. The demons, or whatever you'd like to call them, are not taking him to be tortured in inferno, but if he is to make peace and accept the fact that they are coming for him they are really angels trying to take his soul from the cruel earth. He gets another call, he's found the information he's needed from the army. As everyone knows, the army has been rumored to have experimented with drugs to make Super soldiers, well, this was confirmed by this strange man who has also been following Jacob. He was commissioned during the Vietnam war to create a drug for making super soldiers, The Ladder. The ladder was a dangerous drug- first tested on primapes. They then used it on Jacob's unit, saying that they'd get the highest kill ratio. They did, however, the invisible force from the beginning was their allies. Their kill ration increased, but the ladder made them so violent they began to kill each other, and apparently this drug was the cause of everything Jacob has been seeing. He tries to get in contact with his 2 remaining children and his ex-wife, but cannot find them. He remembers what his doctor told him, and as he is alone with the creatures, accepts his fate. And the demon becomes his dead son, who takes him to heaven. They then have one final twist for the viewers- none of it happened. You see a Vietnam medic camp, and the medics are operating on Jacob, he has just died after the attack seen in the supposed flash backs.\/SPOILERS END \/REVIEWI highly recommend seeing Jacob's Ladder, it's rare you see a film quite like it. Certain shots and scenes have their own visual style, and the acting is actually pretty good, and the story is great, and some sequences are so downright weird and creepy what's there NOT to love about a film like this???? \/REVIEW END 5\/5 ","genre":"Drama, Horror, Mystery"},{"date":"1 April 2006","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Whether you watch the entire trilogy every month or only watched this movie because a friend made you, you can pretty much agree that the thing that is really driving the movies is the character of Ash. At the beginning of the story Ash is the calm simple person that we all are (the S-mart employee in this movie) but as the story progresses, he transforms into the chainsaw wielding ultimate badass with a sawed off shotgun that we all wish we could be. The character of Ash is in his prime from the point he says Groovy in Evil Dead 2 until the point he says Groovy in Army of Darkness when he replaces his chainsaw with a metallic hand. The chainsaw hand and the sawed off shotgun are a large part of the character of Ash. So why does Sam Rami decide to give Ash his hand back and make him fight with medieval weapons in Army of Darkness. With out the Ash from the first Evil Dead movies, Army of Darkness seems to be almost a different genre of movie. The final battle seems to be more like Jason and the Argonauts than Evil Dead. Still the movie is not without its moments. The first encounter between Ash and Badash one of my most memorable. (This one actually does involve the use of a shotgun) Also everyone knows the Boomstick line. (I went to high school with kids who could recite the entire monologue) All in all the film is a good one. It is very funny and deserves the cult status that it has achieved in this day and age. Although I personally wanted to see more of Ash in action, I guess I will just have to pray for Evil Dead 4.

The combination of the music and picture was something new at the time, and still it is. Composer Mr. Morricone was very talented man, in my mind he understood what the music and sounds can really do the movie. In the beginning of the film, where you can hear the coyotes howling, and next you can hear human's and orchestral voice of the same theme. The camera shootings are also great. The silence of dialogs at the first ten minutes was me unbelievable. As a spectator i have to concentrate very carefully what is happening next and why is nobody talking??! And next was history. Atmosphere of this film is huge and the actors co-operation are incredible. Even if the movie is quite long, the time still run fast. And i have this feeling that is it already ends.

In a way, Tony is a violent anarchist, always angry, always wanting more, whether thats money, coke or women. This kind of approach to life is what these guys are after, to be feared and respected. Its amazing to think, a film that was made over 20 years ago is having an effect on the youth today. But it makes me laugh when I see 50 Cent and other rappers trying to act like Tony.Anyway...As for the film, well its genius, to people who haven't seen the film or now nothing about films in general, when you say scarface to them they immediately think of the violence and the drug related scenes that have hung over the films head. But when you watch the film, it isn't very violent, yes it does have short outbursts of violence but not whole scenes donated to it, in a way its more intellectual movie. I'd like to say at this point, I'm not one of those types who are trying to ban violent movies, on the contrary, I love violent films, its just that films like Reservoir dogs, Pulp Fiction and Scarface have built up these untrue reputations of being really violent when there not.Al Pacino is also amazing in these film, I believe that either this or The Godfather Part 2 is his finest role, but we all now how good how Al is in this movie, so I ain't' saying anymore.The film also does this really cool thing in which the audience has a love\/hate relationship with Tony, at the beginning of the film you find yourself cheering him on, but at the end after he kills his best friend, you want him to meet his grisly end.Anyway, enough from me, if you haven't seen it go to your local video store and rent it out. No wait, don't do that go and buy it instead.THE WORLD IS YOURS...
