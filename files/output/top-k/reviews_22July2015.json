[{"date":"22 July 2015","score":"","review":" Run Lola RunRun Lola Run is an extremely loud and graphic short movie. The high-paced and action- packed film sets the scene as the audience hopes to catch up. For example, within minutes the audience is given a setting with a man that is in dire need of $100,000 within 20 minutes. The scene is reset every time Manni (the man that lost the money) and\/or Lola (Manni's girlfriend) are killed. Lola is sent in a scramble to come up with the $100,000 before it is too late. Considering this is a German film it is not out of the question to consider the background of German Expressionism to take center stage in Run Lola Run. According to German Expressionism, German films are generally set in an urban setting and showcase anti-heroic main characters. The audience knows that Manni is most likely engaged in illegal activities because the abundance of police in the film. Manni and Lola aren't exactly everyday heroes seen on the big screen. Run Lola Run also fits the bill as an Expressionist film because of its overall storyline is complete mayhem from beginning to end. This adrenaline-fueled flick seemed like an hour-long video game. Lola was not satisfied with the rules of life, or the game, until she received her desired result. This writer's light bulb beamed brightest when she 'remembered' the safety switch was on the handgun. She did not have to be told how to use the weapon because she had fired the weapon 10 minutes earlier. The concept of breaking the rules to life also applied to the casino scene. Lola was able to will her way to win money at a roulette table even though the odds were completely stacked against her. The color themes used in Run Lola Run also captivated this writer's attention. The color was sequenced according to scenes. Firstly, Lola has red hair and is surrounded in an apartment predominately of a red nature. Not to mention, the bag of money that Lola and Manni stole in the first scene was also red. The second scene featured more of an overarching green scene that showcased a green moneybag, the green painting that Lola threw angrily at her father, as well as Manni describing how Lola would meet a man with green eyes after his unfortunate death. Lastly the third 'life' previewed multiple color schemes. This writer noticed the color gold throughout the 'last-life' scene. Most notably, the color gold was used as the final moneybag and the gold clock that signified the running out of time. Not only was the color gold used but also the color white in the 'final-life' scene. Some examples include the audience finally seeing the inside of the ambulance, the white ball used in roulette, and the white money chips also used in roulette. These colors may not point to exact explanations in the plot. But it was fascinating to see the development of the storyline as well as the transformation of color throughout the film. On a final note, this film had this writer on-edge and engaged for the duration of its hour and twelve minute runtime.

I watched this in U.S. History class and I wasn't expecting much from it. The true story civil rights movement genre is prone to a lot of problems with being biased, unrealistic, and overly dramatic. Also, the movie of this genre I'd seen most recently was Selma Lord Selma (the Disney one, not the one that came out this past winter) and it delivers one the worst possible versions of the civil rights movement. However, The Long Walk Home gave me a pleasant surprise by cutting down on the genre clichés for the most part. It isn't perfect, but there isn't too much to improve on.The primary thing that sets this apart from other black history movies is that it's character driven rather than event driven. Usually the story is weakened by the less cinematically pleasing sequence of historical events that the movie is based on. Here the story was more concentrated onto a few individuals and was driven by their interactions. The only real historical event depicted was the climax with the white mob. This was main thing that made this movie good instead of great for me, because the whole climatic scene felt pretty clichéd. I know that it would have been a big deal and involved a lot of courage, but it still turned me off a bit.The two main characters are Odessa Cotter, the black maid, and her white employer Miriam Thompson. Miriam is probably the more prominent character because of her arc from indifference to support of the boycott. Odessa joins the boycott by walking to work every day and doesn't go through any change, but remains a solid and believable character. Miriam's husband Norman and his brother Tunker are the antagonists of sorts since they oppose the boycott. The other minor characters consist of Miriam's daughter, who is also the narrator, and Odessa's husband and three kids. The way Miriam and Norman are written are what really set this movie apart for me. I had kind of been thinking that the southern white population of the time would have a bigger reason for segregation than blind racism, and Miriam and Norman provided the answer. Neither of them are really racist, but Norman's fear of the general white population pressures him into joining the anti-black movement. Similarly, Miriam's fear of Norman leads her to remain neutral, and therefore safe, in matters of race. I thought that was great, not only because it made for better characters, but also because it showed the white population's faults without completely demonizing them. That's not to say that racism isn't wrong, but it does show true racial equality.The script was pretty well written in terms of having a good story structure, B+ dialogue, and not going overboard or holding back too much with the discrimination scenes. The acting was fair, and might even be disappointing since you have a couple of bigger name actors. I don't know how historically accurate it was, but I doubt there are any inaccuracies that will make people mad.The movie doesn't make any huge anti-racism statements. Racism isn't completely gone in America in the sense that blacks are still generally associated, whether justly or not, with the more run down and dangerous neighborhoods. That said, I think most American's can agree that racial equality has and is becoming more prevalent.So if you want a civil rights movie, I would recommend this more highly than most. There's a lot of dialogue, which might be something to be conscious of. It's not bad as a family movie. There's a little violence and obviously a bit of racial profanity, but nothing you can't let your fourth or fifth grader watch. So give it a shot unless you absolutely hate historical movies.

AT THE EARTH'S CORE in fact is reminiscent of Jules Verne stories like JOURNEY TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH, although it is supposedly from a story by Edgar Rice Burroughs. The low-rent action and outrageous imagery make this film a must for any '70s fan. The decade's influence is clear, as a number of native tribesmen sport fetching afros! Although the film is cheaply made (it employs VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA-style shaking cameras to simulate movement), on the plus side it is a fast-paced adventure tale which never lets up and gives in to characterisation or depth of any sort. In essence it's a series of fight scenes, which take the form of monster vs. monster, man vs. man, man vs. monster. Tacky, ludicrous and awful, this is truly the nadir of British cinema. But...it manages to be exciting, hilarious and a damned good ride through a strange, psychedelic prehistoric land, enlivened by strong performances from two genre veterans.AT THE EARTH'S CORE has a number of spaced-out, obviously drug-induced sequences which are hilarious to watch. The first is the bit where Peter Cushing, no less, is being chased through the cardboard jungle by a giant bird man! I've seen some weird stuff in my time but this really takes the biscuit. The bird men are guys with huge rubber heads on, strange how they remain so motionless throughout the film. The second moment is when a group of people stop to watch some men in monster suits battle it out, kind of like a wacky GODZILLA moment which has been inserted in the film. For a start it's not for one minute believable or realistic, and also the bellowing noises these monsters make are hilarious! More wackiness ensues when a psychic connection between the bird and rodent men is revealed, with the bird guys blinking their green eyes to give commands, these birds are truly strange and yet wonderfully artistic. Especially the noises that are made, which are strangely computerised! Another hilarious moment comes when Peter Cushing shoots a fire breathing, pincushion-like monster with some arrows, it falls off a cliff and explodes in a rib-tickling scene, so cheap and yet so comic. You probably have to have a weird sense of humour like me to appreciate these admittedly dodgy delights. Other merry moments include a caveman with a blatantly cardboard weapon and bird men flying around on visible wires.You've probably grasped the kind of naïve charm this film holds for me by now, but the three main actors are also reasons to watch. Firstly we have low-budget British actress Caroline Munro as the token love interest in highly revealing costume, then there's Doug McClure as the American hero, sporting a disgusting striped jacket. McClure's charm is one which you have to view to really appreciate, but let's just say he's fun as the brawny, indestructible hero type. However it's Peter Cushing who steals the show, this time around being the comic relief, a major departure from his usually heroic or sinister roles. His doddering old man is a great creation, and his dialogue is along the lines of they're so excitable, like all foreigners and You cannot mesmerise me, I'm British! (reused from a similar line in HORROR EXPRESS). The novelty value of seeing him terrorised by these men in suits is great.You wouldn't get away with tackiness like this in a film anymore, that's for sure. Cheap, with atrocious back projection; rubbery, cardboard, yet fun, AT THE EARTH'S CORE is one for the child in all of us - the child who truly appreciate the delights of bad film making.

The low-rent action and outrageous imagery make this film a must for any '70s fan. The decade's influence is clear, as a number of native tribesmen sport fetching afros! Although the film is cheaply made (it employs VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA-style shaking cameras to simulate movement), on the plus side it is a fast-paced adventure tale which never lets up and gives in to characterisation or depth of any sort. In essence it's a series of fight scenes, which take the form of monster vs. monster, man vs. man, man vs. monster. Tacky, ludicrous and awful, this is truly the nadir of British cinema. But...it manages to be exciting, hilarious and a damned good ride through a strange, psychedelic prehistoric land, enlivened by strong performances from two genre veterans.AT THE EARTH'S CORE has a number of spaced-out, obviously drug-induced sequences which are hilarious to watch. The first is the bit where Peter Cushing, no less, is being chased through the cardboard jungle by a giant bird man! I've seen some weird stuff in my time but this really takes the biscuit. The bird men are guys with huge rubber heads on, strange how they remain so motionless throughout the film. The second moment is when a group of people stop to watch some men in monster suits battle it out, kind of like a wacky GODZILLA moment which has been inserted in the film. For a start it's not for one minute believable or realistic, and also the bellowing noises these monsters make are hilarious! More wackiness ensues when a psychic connection between the bird and rodent men is revealed, with the bird guys blinking their green eyes to give commands, these birds are truly strange and yet wonderfully artistic. Especially the noises that are made, which are strangely computerised! Another hilarious moment comes when Peter Cushing shoots a fire breathing, pincushion-like monster with some arrows, it falls off a cliff and explodes in a rib-tickling scene, so cheap and yet so comic. You probably have to have a weird sense of humour like me to appreciate these admittedly dodgy delights. Other merry moments include a caveman with a blatantly cardboard weapon and bird men flying around on visible wires.You've probably grasped the kind of naïve charm this film holds for me by now, but the three main actors are also reasons to watch. Firstly we have low-budget British actress Caroline Munro as the token love interest in highly revealing costume, then there's Doug McClure as the American hero, sporting a disgusting striped jacket. McClure's charm is one which you have to view to really appreciate, but let's just say he's fun as the brawny, indestructible hero type. However it's Peter Cushing who steals the show, this time around being the comic relief, a major departure from his usually heroic or sinister roles. His doddering old man is a great creation, and his dialogue is along the lines of they're so excitable, like all foreigners and You cannot mesmerise me, I'm British! (reused from a similar line in HORROR EXPRESS). The novelty value of seeing him terrorised by these men in suits is great.You wouldn't get away with tackiness like this in a film anymore, that's for sure. Cheap, with atrocious back projection; rubbery, cardboard, yet fun, AT THE EARTH'S CORE is one for the child in all of us - the child who truly appreciate the delights of bad film making.

Is it worth it? Yes it is, yes it is, oh yes it is. Personally, I enjoyed this one more than the first, as it has more action, more laughs, and more excitement in it than the first film. Basically, the filmmakers from the first film take the previous formula, they change the setting, and they add some more action to it, and we get this movie, a film that's got twice as much action and laughs than ever before. Some of the critics complained that the movie was too cartoonish and sadistic as far as its gags were concerned. In my opinion, I didn't think that, as the gags were hilarious, and also, it's a movie, what is in the movie isn't supposed to be realistic. Basically, if you enjoyed the first film, then you will probably end up enjoying this one even more, as the laughs are even bigger than in the previous film.As with the first film, the cast in the movie all do very well jobs with their acting. Once again, Macaulay Culkin is superb in his role as Kevin McCallister, who is stranded again, but this time in New York. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are hilarious in their roles as Harry and Marv, the two burglars from the first film who haven't forgotten about their last encounter with Kevin. Tim Curry gives a hilarious performance as the concierge of a hotel that becomes very suspicious of Kevin. Basically, the entire cast did well, but Culkin, Pesci, Stern, and Curry did the best in my opinion. Like I said with the first film, Culkin was one of the greatest child actors in show business.As I said, this movie contains numerous hysterical bits. There's a hysterical scene where Kevin puts an inflatable Bozo The Clown in the shower, and when Tim Curry sneaks into the room to see what Kevin's up to, Kevin plays a recording of his uncle, causing Tim Curry to get startled and run out of the room, then there's the scene with the gangster movie. However, the funniest scenes occur in the climax, where Kevin does what he did to Marv and Harry in the previous film, set up traps for them, and boy, the laughs come rolling in big quantities in those scenes.If you enjoyed Home Alone, then Home Alone 2 is something that you've got to see, as it is even better than the first film. Why there can't be comedies like this one nowadays I have absolutely no clue, perhaps if they did, then maybe the movie industry would be better. So if you want laughs, then this is a movie that will do it, and when it gives laughs, it gives big ones at that. In fact, if you want to do something really fun, then watch this movie right after you watch the first one, that will really fulfill your comedy desire.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 July 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" One year after Kevin was left home alone and had to defeat a pair of bumbling burglars, he accidentally finds himself in New York City, and the same criminals are not far behind.Considering how much I enjoyed the first Home Alone movie, I thought that it would be worth it to see the second film.

Aided by the darkest tone yet seen in a superhero film, a brooding Michael Keaton and an enormous performance from Jack Nicholson, it was a big hit and spawned a franchise.Unlike the only other really successful superhero film we had to go at the time, Richard Donner's Superman, Batman does not get bogged down in origins. We learn, through flashbacks well into the film's run, that Bruce Wayne saw his parents murdered by Jack Napier when he was a child, and this led to him becoming a vigilante. How he learned martial arts, developed weapons, and ended up with a bat obsession is anyone's guess. The police and media are trying to work out what to make of stories of this weird guy jumping around wearing a batsuit, kicking ass and killing criminals, and so are we.What Burton does focus on is Nicholson, understandable given that some estimates have Nicholson being paid upwards of $60 million for his appearance by the time all the box office and merchandising receipts were cashed. This is the Joker's origin story, a sleazy mob enforcer, horribly disfigured and driven mad after being betrayed by mob boss Carl Grissom. Nicholson is equal parts menacing and funny. He is a sadistic, unstable force of nature who commits atrocities and then laughs about it, including one scene where he makes a TV commercial featuring people he has killed promoting a poison he's unleashed on the public. Not a light character, but a lot of fun to watch.Against this kind of insane evil, we need a hero to get behind, and playing off Nicholson's enormous performance, Keaton provides a strong adversary. Disturbed, brooding, but driven, this is a man who will kill for the greater good and hold evil accountable. He's no Elliott Ness, but by the time the final confrontation unfolds, we know where he stands and can get behind him.The supporting cast, while somewhat wasted, are all welcome. Specifically Michael Gough as Alfred, the Wayne Family Butler. Kim Basinger is a typical damsel in distress as Vikki Vale, Billy Dee Williams is criminally wasted as Harvey Dent.I've often heard people say of this film that it is not dark and doesn't have Batman in it enough. I'm not certain they watched the same film I did. Nicholson's Joker is a frightening creation, perhaps even more frightening for the humour he indulges in as he commits acts of considerable evil.

It may actually be better if Farrah Fawcett plays dumber. Its unabashed ridiculing of leftist environmental movement probably left the critics cold. Its low brow humor also doesn't help. But everybody has to love the hilarious outtakes. ","genre":"Action, Comedy, Sport"}]
