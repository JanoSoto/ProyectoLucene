He couldn't wait to see this movie that was heralded by Spielberg and others as a bonafide docudrama, a true story based on a young man in WWII who lost three brothers to death behind enemy lines, and the most stunning war movie to ever hit Hollywood's silver screen.Both he and I were shocked by the brutal reality of the scenes on the beach. That was truly amazing cinematography and imagery by Spielberg. Sure, both he and I noticed the many unrealistic aspects of even these scenes, minor errors in small details, but my grandfather said those scenes were closer to the reality than any movie had come yet.But both my grandfather (a veteran and retired military historian) and I (a hobby historian) noticed the movie soon changed. While the movie was without a doubt strong with feeling an imagery, the realism is soon gone. The soldiers are out of character, the special effects overdone, and the military equipment (particularly the Tiger tanks) used\/referenced incorrect. The worst part was that this movie, heralded as a true story didn't have enough truth in it to fill an eye-dropper.This movie was not, however, a failure. Spielberg did an excellent job at creating a fictitious storyline that almost seems like it was real, and then used the Hollywood glitz and glamour to create his version of WWII. This movie is extremely well done for a war movie, and well worth watching as long as the viewer remembers two important things 1) This movie is NOT real. 2) This movie is NOT a true story. There was no Pvt. Ryan. This movie is *extremely* loosely based on the losses of two families in WWII -- the Nilands, who lost two of their four sons (one was MIA and later found, and the other wandered around in enemy territory for 18 days before finding his way back to camp and being told he was being sent home), and the Sullivans, who lost all five of their sons in a 1942 loss at sea. (For more on those five, watch the film The Sullivans.) Neither situation involved what was seen in the film.This movie should be rated on three separate scales. The only true rating for this movie can be on it's ability to entertain and hold the viewers interest (nine out of ten by both my grandfather and I). For its rating on realistically portraying the general conditions on WWII, it measures about a six and a half, and on its realism as far as based on a true story, this movie deserves a zero, because it is entirely fictionalised.Definitely see this movie, but if you're looking for realism in a 1998 war film, check out The Thin Red Line. Both its storyline and its basic cinematography is more realistic and true. It is only for true war buffs though -- the movie rates high for both realism and truth, but fairly low for entertainment value because of Malick's attempt at keeping it realistic.

So I watched it and I have to say that it was very interesting. I have never seen a movie like this before. The plot is quite strange but, hey, what do you expect when watching a portrait of a serial killer! Sometimes it looked a little bit like a documentary but, I think, that created the atmosphere of the movie. You`re right in the middle, you observe (almost) every killing but, nevertheless, I felt some kind of sympathy for Henry. He`s sick and he has to kill somebody (he`s kinda addicted to it) but then it was interesting to see how he developed feelings for the girl (for the first time in his life?).... Well, I could write on and on because it is a kind of film you don`t get to see that often. I love the directing in this one. The camera and the actors told everything. There was no need for excessive tilts and pans and cuts. Just simple and smooth. Good, interesting, disturbing, unusual and tough stuff which is worth watching.

So I watched it and I have to say that it was very interesting. I have never seen a movie like this before. The plot is quite strange but, hey, what do you expect when watching a portrait of a serial killer! Sometimes it looked a little bit like a documentary but, I think, that created the atmosphere of the movie. You`re right in the middle, you observe (almost) every killing but, nevertheless, I felt some kind of sympathy for Henry. He`s sick and he has to kill somebody (he`s kinda addicted to it) but then it was interesting to see how he developed feelings for the girl (for the first time in his life?)....

The only movie of this type that comes close to Groundhog day, in my most humble opinion, is As Good As it Gets.     See Groundhog day.

I was 8 or 9. I fell in love with a)Julie Andrews b) Angela Cartwright c) Cinerama d) Rogers & Hammerstein and e) Chris Plummer Hamming it up in great style. So many things to love. Particularly the orchestrations. How I wish the classic soundtrack included healthy measures of the incidental music, for example from Do-Re-Mi. That wonderful scherzando toy piano-sound version of Favorite Things as the family teem out of the Von Trapp estate's gates. Such a shame there were never enough good projects for Julie Andrews. I remember when she used to appear on shows after TSOM and sort of tried to shrug it off like a ghost, and yet it has turned out to be the defining performance of her career, and rightfully so. She has such a deft touch with humor, in fact that is one of the aspects of TSOM people overlook, in many areas it is done with great lightness-of-touch. As noted by others Richard Haydn's Heil Hitler and countless others. And the scene in the Abbey graveyard with the torches is made truly eerie, especially on wide screen as the torch beams play and the shadows deepen and the Trapps huddle. In my opinion it is these little homey touches (the runners-up at the Music Festival) of humor which make the whole so infectious.And the script is superb. You have to look for your life. You have to lead the life you were born to lead. plain and powerful. To Your face is all red in my favorite scene in the whole movie The Landler sequence. When Julie and the Captain suddenly spark high voltage. And then the wonderful line I can't remember the rest seems so true to life. It's the best.
