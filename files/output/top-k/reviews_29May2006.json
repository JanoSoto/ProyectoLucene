This was especially odd because it wasn't the kind of film Lynch had been putting out in the last 15 -20 years. Those were dark and shocking films (Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart, Mulholland Drive) and this is the opposite. I know it disappointed a lot of his fans. Others were delighted by it. Count me as one of the latter, and I own all three of those dark films, too.This was another supposed-true life story, here detailing an elderly man's trip in a seated lawnmower from western Iowa all the way to Wisconsin to see his ailing brother who he hasn't talked to in years but wants to see before the latter dies. Well, I guess that premise - an old man driving a lawn mower 400 miles - still makes this an odd film of sorts, so Lynch stays in character with that! Richard Farnsworth plays the title role. He is the type of guy, face-wise, voice-wise, low-key personality-wise, that just about everyone likes. The wrinkles on his face tell many a story. It was so sad to hear what happened to him in real life a year after this film was released.The first 25 minutes of this film isn't much, and not always pleasant as it shows the main character's adult and mentally-challenged child (Sissy Spacek) and her tragic past, but once Alvin Straight (Farnsworth) begins his trip, the story picks up. I played this for several friends and they thought the film NEVER picked up, but I am more generous with it. I think it's a hidden gem. To them, it was a sleeping pill.I found his trip pretty fascinating but you have to realize in advance this is NOT going to be a suspenseful Lynch crime story. It IS slow and if that's okay with you, you might like this. Charm enters the picture in some of people Alvin meets along the way, such as a wayward young girl running away and some nice town folks who help the old man out when he gets in trouble. (Henry Cada as Daniel Riordan, is a standout in that regard.) Harry Dean Stanton gets third billing, but that's a joke he's only in the final few minutes of the movie!The Iowa scenery is pleasant. I lived there for several years and can attest to the rolling hills and the rich soil. It's a nice state with nice people....like this movie.

It is truly a period piece and as such, it is a powerful chiller-thriller.A hit on Broadway, 'The Bad Seed' was translated into film as though it were a play; hence various commentators speak of its staginess and sometimes overwrought acting as if they were serious objections to the enjoyability of the movie. But does anyone complain that 'Dracula' was stagy and overwrought? No, because the movie is classic in and of itself, and so is 'The Bad Seed'.Translate your mind back to the early nineteen-fifties and 'The Bad Seed' takes on new levels of meaning and challenge. Christine Penrose, whose military husband is called away from home, is raising her darling daughter Rhoda on her own when things start slowly coming apart. Rhoda is the perfect eight-year-old, a pretty, intelligent and very affectionate child, in crinoline dresses and blonde braids, to whom everyone around gives praise and, often, gifts. She is always grateful and loving in her delight with what she gets. What is wrong with this picture? Rhoda wants something very badly, something she feels she won and has been unjustly denied, something that disappeared when its owner died a sudden, tragic death. So why does it turn up in Rhoda's possessions? Christine Penmark has no idea what is going on. Children were not believed to have mature personalities according to the psychology of the day, and the case of Leopold and Loeb was brutal and startling, and apparently a singular aberration, just a few years before the play debuted. There was then no way to explain what Christine begins to perceive that Rhoda takes what she wants if she can't charm her way to it, and anyone who gets in her way she simply 'removes'. This wasn't supposed to happen in the 1950's. Today we may be more reliably informed, especially to the statistics that point clearly to the 'nurture rather than nature' explanation, but Christine is alone with her manipulative little murderess with no world-view to encompass what she faces. Her confusion and denial aren't weaknesses of character but the product of the general understanding of the day.It is not until she has a chance encounter with a criminal psychologist who posits the 'nature, not nurture' theory of criminality, and then digs more deeply into the dark secret of her own childhood that things begin to add up, and Christine Penmark herself unravels in as ghastly a manner as her life has done.The play is in black and white, and so are the performances and the ethics and morality of its message. Rhoda has only two sides to her the apparently good, affectionate, perfect angel and the manifestly evil, selfish, deadly crocodile-brained killer. Patty MacCormack is excellent in the dual portrayal, and her performance as a child actress is an achievement seldom rivaled and never bettered.Nancy Kelly's utter devastation, step by step, is carefully crafted and touched with a dread terror that recognizes, though never states, that Christine knows that she herself is not safe around Rhoda, let alone anyone else. Her response to that knowledge is telling; she is the mother of a murderess, after all.The performances of Henry Jones as the unsavory handyman the audience ends up wanting Rhoda to put out of our misery and Eileen Heckart as the bereft and alcoholic mother of Rhoda's dead schoolmate are both stand-outs. Again, look to the time of the filming. People had no access to the psychiatric and sociological services both of these two characters needed in spades. People like them were out there in the 50's, more of them than we -- five decades or so later -- want to think, and without help or restraints we expect to come naturally now. Terrifying or pitiable, they were there when the movie was made.I read the book before I saw the movie, so I expected the original ending and was somewhat disappointed that it was changed. But the add-on tag is yet another level of good v. evil, one the audience might embrace emotionally if not intellectually, and perhaps more reflective of other beliefs of the 1950's, also.Beware if the Penmarks move in next door.

And it has a few really very fine moments, starting with a very slight one that most are going to miss, the Credits. A lot of character is packed into the poses of the silent Valdez riding the stagecoach as guard, from the way he pulls up his coat against the cold, and then the way he chomps his apple and slices off a piece for the driver. Too bad the rest of the movie could have shifted to that kind of subtlety. But I have said even so. And so it is, everything in this film is bang bam square in the face, from its blatant racism to the very milquetoast of Valdez one to the Superman lost my cape Valdez two few westerns weaknesses have been so much their strengths. If there is, however one blatant overweening irreparable weakness its is Cypher. He just is so overwrought he is embarrassing. And Lancaster, silent, screwing in his long range rifle and starting to mow down Cyphers men, is great. For about a minute you follow his eyes over the gun and revel in his greatness. As for the plot, forget it. As full of holes as most movies. Susan Clark, admitting she killed her husband also has a fine, toothy moment. The really truly great thing about this film however is the acrobatics of Lancaster, taking us nearly all the way back to the Crimson Pirate. Just look at him scamper and grab, practically somersaulting about nobody in the history of cinema ever had anything close to his physical presence, his balletic glide and grace, his long loopy way of snatching and holding things. And this movie puts it all very center stage. That alone gives this a high place in the Lancaster canon. Don't miss it.

Lancasters accent from central casting is a bit overdone, even hokey, as is most of the story. Overdone. Even so there is a nice feel to this thing. And it has a few really very fine moments, starting with a very slight one that most are going to miss, the Credits. A lot of character is packed into the poses of the silent Valdez riding the stagecoach as guard, from the way he pulls up his coat against the cold, and then the way he chomps his apple and slices off a piece for the driver. Too bad the rest of the movie could have shifted to that kind of subtlety. But I have said even so. And so it is, everything in this film is bang bam square in the face, from its blatant racism to the very milquetoast of Valdez one to the Superman lost my cape Valdez two few westerns weaknesses have been so much their strengths. If there is, however one blatant overweening irreparable weakness its is Cypher. He just is so overwrought he is embarrassing. And Lancaster, silent, screwing in his long range rifle and starting to mow down Cyphers men, is great. For about a minute you follow his eyes over the gun and revel in his greatness. As for the plot, forget it. As full of holes as most movies. Susan Clark, admitting she killed her husband also has a fine, toothy moment.

In its 3 hour run time it manages to pull off telling two stories. One that takes place in the 1950s, and one that takes place in the 1920s. In the 1920s we see Vito Corleone arriving in New York City and making a name for himself among the wealthy gangsters, starting a family, and eventually becoming Don of the Corleone crime family. The exact parallel is the 1950s story, where we see Vito's son Michael in his new role as Don of the Corleone family as he starts his own family. The Godfather Part II is a superior film to the original because it tells a much more interesting story, and it does a better job at portraying what an organized crime family is really like.All of the great actors from the original are back including James Caan in a flashback sequence. Al Pacino comes across as a great bad guy, and he seems to be ten times more cold hearted than his father ever was. He's a changed man. He started off a legitimate man who wanted nothing to do with his family's business, but now he's more into it than ever before. This movie features Al Pacino's second best performance in a film (second to Dog Day Afternoon), and it shows what kind of actor he truly is. This is the film that made Robert De Niro a star, and rightly so. Robert De Niro portrays young Vito Corleone on his rise to power in New York. This is Robert De Niro's first big role and he plays it like he's been doing it for years. The best thing about it is that just about every line of his dialogue is in Italian, and yet you still enjoy his performance.The Godfather Part II contains the most realistic view of the mafia ever portrayed in film. In fact it's so realistic that the central characters don't even refer to it as the mafia. The Godfather Part II tells a more interesting story than the original, and it's more fun to sit through.

The Bridge on the River Kwai is outstanding in all departments. Based on a French novel by Pierre Boulle which in turn was a literary adaptation of a true story, director David Lean, with the able assistance of blacklisted screenwriters Michael Wilson and Carl Foreman, has fashioned a remarkable motion picture that shows, more than most at first realize, the senselessness and madness of war. Lean was also helped tremendously by Jack Hildyard's cinematography, making the jungles of Ceylon come alive for the camera. One telling scene that pinpoints the majesty of Lean and Hildyard's collaboration is when Cmdr. Shears (William Holden) is lost in the wilds while attempting to escape from the POW camp. A strange looking bird flopping overhead turns out to be a kite.

Yet he has the admirable quality of also being a gentleman and a role model for the men under his command. His fortitude and perseverance in a near death encounter with the Japanese POW commander, Col. Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), make him a martyr for his men and his country.

Saito is Col. Nicholson's nemesis and foil. Saito bends all the rules for his on egomania; yet he is intelligent enough to know when to falter. It becomes easy for Maj. Clipton to convince Saito not to shoot Nicholson in front of witnesses. Saito sees the bridge project as a means for his own salvation and advancement, also knowing that if he fails he will likely be executed, at best demoted and shamed. Saito not being a by-the-book officer finds it easy after a self-saving catharsis to be pragmatic.A wild card in the game is the cynic with a conscience, Cmdr. Shears. He has learned to be a con man from his experiences in the US navy at war. Much of the humor in the film is provided by Shears, having some truly laughable comebacks for the ever so serious British officers. Maj.

The consensus of opinion is that the most sensible thing for Major Shears to do is to go ahead and jump, and hope for the best. To which Shears retorts dryly, With or without a parachute?

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"29 May 2006","score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" The directorial debut of the obviously multi-talented Matthew Bright turned out one of the coolest movies of the entire 90's decade, a witty and sometimes truly original Indie-film with some genuine 70's exploitation trademarks. The story is a very personal and dared interpretation of the famous Little Red Riding Hood fairy-tale, transposed from the woods to present day California and featuring more appropriate menaces like prostitution, serial killers, drug addiction and child abuse. In her most fabulous performance ever (her recent brilliant portrayal of June Carter in Walk the Line not included), Reese Witherspoon stars as an illiterate and very unlucky teenager stuck in the lowest social class with a street-walking mother and a sex-hungry stepfather. When welfare officers once again try to put her in a foster family, she hopes to flee to her grandmother but ends even deeper in hell. She's offered a ride by a seemly caring psychologist who turns out a sadistic murderer that is difficult to beat! Freeway works as a disturbing thriller, but also as a tongue-in-cheek black comedy that illustrates human decay from a teenager's perspective. There are quite a lot of (major) plot holes in the script and some sequences &#150; especially in the second half of the film &#150; are a bit redundant, but Matthew Bright keeps it all very interesting with a fast pace and stylish art direction. Apart from Witherspoon and the always adequate Kiefer Sutherland, great acting talents can be found in the supportive cast, like Dan Hedaya, Amanda Plummer, Michael T. Weiss and Brittany Murphy. Even Brooke Shields is amazing in the last role you'd ever expect her to play! Danny Elfman's unique and quite petrifying musical score also contributes in making Freeway one of the most sensational post-Pulp Fiction thrillers and definitely a future classic.
