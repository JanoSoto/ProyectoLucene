There is no doubt that Mr. Winston was one of the elite of his time when it came to making creatures in cinema. Surprisingly, this particular horror film is Stan Winston's directorial debut and although he isn't an actual story telling visionary like Stephen King or Clive Barker, it is clear that he tried to make it match to the other forms of horror that were already released. Unfortunately, the demon Pumpkinhead is probably one of the lesser-known horror villains in recent memory. If anything, it is a well made guilty pleasure horror film for most.The story is about widower countryman Ed Harley (Lance Henriksen), a loving father who's son Billy, means everything to him. One day when a group of traveling city kids pass by and accidentally kill Billy, Ed calls upon a demon named Pumpkinhead to take his vengeance on the people who killed his son. But that's not all, apparently with resurrecting this creature come some extremely unpleasant side effects. Which in fact, these side effects can get kind of confusing. It's not to say that the writing is bad but there wasn't any clarification on what was happening with these side effects. Plus, there was a character in the film that could have explained this. It's not like no one knew how Pumpkinhead does his work. Other than that, the writing is fine.Even for the slew of no name actors that took part in the film give believable performances. When the city kids realize they hit Billy, the nervousness and tension feels real between all of them. Also what's cool is that Jeff East, the actor who played Young Clark Kent in Richard Donner's Superman (1978) is in here too. Lance Henriksen no doubt puts in a good performance as the emotional father who grieves over the only thing that meant something to him. Perhaps what gave this film an interesting edge is that the location isn't the normal setting. The story takes place on rural landscape. Nothing feels cleanly - yeah sure the setting wasn't clean in Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) either, but it was only in certain places. Here, everywhere feels dirty, inside and out. It's a different feel that most horror films don't have anymore.This pretty much goes hand-in-hand with set decorator Kurt Gauger's work, which gives the backgrounds a very dusty rural feel. Helping that feeling come around full circle is Richard Stone's score to the film. He doesn't create a main theme, but his incorporation of instruments that sound like they belong on a farm match the setting and images with ease. He even includes some emotional tunes. However, his ability to help bring out the horror elements to the film is underdeveloped. Thankfully, Pumpkinhead himself looks like a force that shouldn't be messed with - especially for 1988. When the cicadas sound, you know he's around. Although according to sources, that Stan Winston didn't have any time to inject his input into the concept, the design of Pumpkinhead is somewhat of a knock off. Much of the structure looks similar to that of the Alien (1979) franchise - which Winston did work on. I guess it's difficult to come up with a design to a creature called Pumpkinhead. It is a little off putting. As for gore goes, the death scenes are in the middle. Some can be graphic while others are cut too early to determine whether it was. Adding to the sometimes hard to see visuals are the dual color tones that are frequently used; dark blue for the wilderness and orange red for the inside of houses. I don't know if there's a deeper meaning to it but it may make viewers wish that there were more of a color palette to the film. Unfortunately, with all these factors accounted for, the actual terror factor of this film is quite low unless you are extremely young or you're not a horror fan in general. It's still a good movie but it's not scary like it could've been.Even with creature effects master, Stan Winston directing, Pumpkinhead rarely scares. That's not to say it isn't entertaining though. The performances are believable, the sets feel real and the creature itself is presented professionally.

Even though some may perceive some of the scenes as grotesque and barbaric, the movie presents a well-balanced view of life in Roman times. It is certainly entertaining, artistic and thoughtful in its own way.With an outstanding cast of actors, Gladiator has shown to the world that great movies can still be made when enough attention is given to every single detail of production. Certainly the movie was a success because of its script and seasoned and measured acting performances. It was also Oliver Reed's farewell performance, which fully encompassed his abilities as an actor. Perhaps it was pure fate that the casting director and production team chose him for the role. Nevertheless, it is hard to imagine someone else playing his role.This is certainly a movie that must be seen on the big screen uninterruptedly. And once you have seen it, please grab a history book and learn few more things about the ancestral heritage of the Roman empire.

Mel Brooks used the resources of his own production company, Brooksfilms, to give David Lynch his first chance at a mainstream directing job with The Elephant Man. Patton reiterates that Stuart Cornfeld convinced him to do so by dragging Brooks to a midnight screening of Eraserhead. Since I was young, I've had the utmost admiration for Mel Brooks. And let me tell you something sister, E-Head's unsettling.I hate this movie.Slimy slithering intestines don't flutter my fancy.Did that sentence make you feel gross? It should; hopefully it scares you away completely. Because that's all this movie does; it seeks to disturb the viewer. So in that department Mission Accomplished, Mr. Lynch.This is by far his worst.It's smart; don't get me wrong. But originality only goes so far with me. When the ride gets painful, stars begin falling off. It's not fun, enjoyable nor educational.Some consider it thought-provoking. I don't.To be more specific, Eraserhead is about the fears of fatherhood. Despite the cover, it doesn't disturb in a manner akin to horror flicks.It's about depravity and inhabits it's own dark shred of sadness that doesn't require a specific genre. Let's call it what it is A student film.There's a lot I don't like.In particular, I really hate the fetus-stomping blonde (or Lady in Radiator, played by Laurel Near) with the fatty cheeks. It's never fun when she shows up; out of tune and singing the saddest song ever. Any scene involving the deformed baby, its grotesque skin disease or the anxiety-inducing wail of sorrow; I'd happily discharge from my brain. It's the single cringe-worthiest hundred minutes of my life. And I've seen a couple movies that'll convert an entire nunnery.Jack Nance as Henry Spencer is very good.The Girl Across the Hall (played by Judith Anna Roberts) is also solid. She dons a low cut dress and walks with a sinewy strut that'll entrance.But all the acting is good, I suppose. Allen Joseph as Mr. X is an oddball who offers the only chuckle.Lynch apparently likes featuring scenes of a spotlight on an empty stage. The shame idea shows up in Mulholland Drive. I don't know what the hell with to do with it.More often I wonder whether it's worth the ponder.Towards the beginning, Henry traverses squat mounds of ashy dust while a train whistle blares in the background. Considering the subject material, I wonder if it's in reference to Ernest Hemingway's Hills Like White Elephants. That short story's about debating abortion and a couple torn up by unexpected pregnancy.And it's Hemingway; it's wildly unpleasant. But much more enjoyable than Eraserhead.Okay, I'll slow down with the pessimism for a moment.To be honest with you I could hate on this movie a lot more than I'm going to. It has redeeming qualities but they bring the rating up to a whopping one star. I'm not mad about it; it's just not what I go to a movie for.These moments of redemption are few and far between. There's a lot of intricate camera angles involving shadows and how they fall on the characters. Even the majority of the smart stuff leaves a bad taste in my mouth! Like the leafless twig thrust into a pile of soil upon the nightstand. Dirt granules certainly spill onto his mattress on occasion.There are two particularly noteworthy scenes. They're both gross and unsettling, but somehow they shine amidst the pit of yuck.When Henry's in bed with a woman, they're wrapped up in the sheets like a spider, and her teeth are chattering like she's freezing. The spindly way she's twisting, contorting and toiling amidst the covers is creepy and discomforting.The other scene involves Henry making love to a woman, and their infidelity descending into milky white tub water situated in the center of the bed. It's a beautiful shot and really a thought-provoking scene with a fascinating dynamic.But even then, it's still pretty unsettling.Ugh! There's so much filth in Henry's room. The sound effects and score are constantly ghoulish, grotesque, creaky, whistley, shadowy, lurid, crackly, scratchy and overall irksome.It's an Odyssey through disgust, silt and darkness. And it's the rockiest ride amidst a meteor shower.Do yourself a favor and skip Eraserhead, and check out Mulholland Drive or Blue Velvet instead. Only the biggest of Lynch's fans will like this. It's 'un-good.'By the way, I don't know what he saw in it, but I still highly admire Mel Brooks.Looks like it's time to catch The Elephant Man.

Stone fails to capture the essence of the conflict and most important to capture the reality of the situation. He portrays and depicts the right wing as terrorists while failing to show that the left guerrillas were even worse in their actions. The left guerrillas destroyed the country and everything that was good about it. The guerrillas enrolled child soldiers and spread hatred among Salvadorians. Stone failed to show how the right wing actually tried to help a country divided by a communist movement occurring across a Latin American level. Most important, what truly is offensive is the assassination of Monseñor Romero. This is so false, since Monseñor was shot by a sniper who nobody ever saw or knew who it was. Also, to this day nobody knows who is responsible for this assassination. This is a good film in the sense of fiction, because James Woods and Belushi give out an excellent performance. But this movie does not depict the reality of the situation at all. Please do not use it as a way of educating people about the war in El Salvador, because this is nothing like it. This is pure fiction and plus it is all shot in Mexico. To be fair I enjoy the acting but the movie should have never been called Salvador, because it has nothing to do with the real conflict. Do not be misguided or fooled by Stone's leftist tendency. I have much respect for Mr. Stone but here he just shows how he really is an advocate for the modern socialist movement.

Batman & Robin is a campy disaster complete with bad performances, cringe-worthy lines of dialog, dumb characters, and distracting neon lights that annoyingly show during almost every scene.Batman (George Clooney) and Robin (Chris O'Donnell) are called to the Gotham City Museum to stop a robbery underway by freeze-ray wielding super villain Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Freeze manages to escape, putting a strain on Batman and Robin's partnership. Meanwhile, he deadly Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) and an ex-con turned super soldier Bane (Jeep Swenson) head to Gotham in an attempt for Ivy's plan of saving the world's plants, and ends up forming a team with Mr. Freeze. From the one-line spurting Mr. Freeze to the bat-nipple wear Batman, the characters of the film are the largest problem with it. Schwarzenegger has the look of Mr. Freeze, but his acting talent is playing muscles-of- steel action heroes and does not posses what was needed to pull off the emotional and dramatic back story involving his mortally ill wife (Vendela Kirsebom). George Clooney possesses the elegant, playboy style of Bruce Wayne, but not the tormented and darker Batman. Bane in this movie is played as a bumbling idiot to serve as a strongman for the heroes to fight.The film tries to have the campy feel to it like the Adam West and Burt Ward show from the '60s had, but this attempt fails with the inclusion of Mr. Freeze's tragic back story and the subplot involving beloved butler Alfred (Michael Gough) dying.While the movie does have a reason to include every single one of its characters, with none of them included for fan service or just for the sake of having characters, the same can not be said about the vehicles and gadgets of the film, which exist solely for toys and marketing.Batman & Robin is a brainless movie that relies more on flashy effects and marketing than it does on its story and characters. Yes, the film is bad and there were a lot of bad elements, but I would say this is more of a let down than one of the worst movies ever.

From the one-line spurting Mr. Freeze to the bat-nipple wear Batman, the characters of the film are the largest problem with it. Schwarzenegger has the look of Mr. Freeze, but his acting talent is playing muscles-of- steel action heroes and does not posses what was needed to pull off the emotional and dramatic back story involving his mortally ill wife (Vendela Kirsebom). George Clooney possesses the elegant, playboy style of Bruce Wayne, but not the tormented and darker Batman. Bane in this movie is played as a bumbling idiot to serve as a strongman for the heroes to fight.The film tries to have the campy feel to it like the Adam West and Burt Ward show from the '60s had, but this attempt fails with the inclusion of Mr. Freeze's tragic back story and the subplot involving beloved butler Alfred (Michael Gough) dying.While the movie does have a reason to include every single one of its characters, with none of them included for fan service or just for the sake of having characters, the same can not be said about the vehicles and gadgets of the film, which exist solely for toys and marketing.Batman & Robin is a brainless movie that relies more on flashy effects and marketing than it does on its story and characters. Yes, the film is bad and there were a lot of bad elements, but I would say this is more of a let down than one of the worst movies ever. For those people saying this is the worst movie ever, I envy you because you have not seen the terrible junk I've unfortunately sat through.

Yes -- the movie is about the downfall of the old South, how people learn to survive thru desperate times, but mostly it's a saddening portrait of lost souls, in my opinion. The movie begins as 2 plantations in the pre-Civil war south live a life of grandeur but it is soon challenged by an inevitable war that threatens to ruin the fantasy world that they lived in -- and thus is Gone with the Wind. Scarlett is a character that is used to getting what she wants due to her prestige or her good looks -- but she definitely can't handle things initially with they don't go her own way. She learns to manipulate and do whatever it takes to attempt to have her needs satisfied but constantly is denied her main pursuit which is trying to get her sister's fiancée to love her, and she pursues this up to almost the end of the movie. Rhett Butler is a wanderer who is really a lot like Scarlett but does eventually learn primarily because of having a daughter. This movie, based on the Margaret Mitchell novel, is mostly about character and shows us the examples of good and bad and the results of each's actions. The good souls are portrayed by Maureen O'Hara and Leslie Howard. Maureen as Scarlett's sister rarely does any wrong and Howard's character continually fight's off his temptations, but the other main characters do very little right. With so much sadness in this movie it's amazing it is so well liked. I believe the deeper meaning comes thru and people cling to that as I did while viewing this very uniquely filmed movie which does some amazing things with shadows with the cinematography overall being excellent. Despite the long length of the movie it keeps your interest, but I believe it would be a hard movie to watch more than once...I'm glad I gave it the once, and I understand why the movie was so critically acclaimed.

Yes -- the movie is about the downfall of the old South, how people learn to survive thru desperate times, but mostly it's a saddening portrait of lost souls, in my opinion. The movie begins as 2 plantations in the pre-Civil war south live a life of grandeur but it is soon challenged by an inevitable war that threatens to ruin the fantasy world that they lived in -- and thus is Gone with the Wind. Scarlett is a character that is used to getting what she wants due to her prestige or her good looks -- but she definitely can't handle things initially with they don't go her own way. She learns to manipulate and do whatever it takes to attempt to have her needs satisfied but constantly is denied her main pursuit which is trying to get her sister's fiancée to love her, and she pursues this up to almost the end of the movie. Rhett Butler is a wanderer who is really a lot like Scarlett but does eventually learn primarily because of having a daughter. This movie, based on the Margaret Mitchell novel, is mostly about character and shows us the examples of good and bad and the results of each's actions.

I guess that Disney intended the movie as a morality tale.Some other things *Stromboli is a volcano off the coast of Sicily. Woody Guthrie wrote a song about Ingrid Bergman and basically said that he wanted to get slinky with her on Stromboli. Billy Bragg put the song to music.*I see that Mel Blanc did Gideon's hiccups, making this one of his rare contributions to Disney. He was already providing voices for the Looney Tunes, and soon after got signed exclusively to Warner Bros.*The nose-growing scene enabled me to reference Nixon (with whom Walt Disney was big buddies).*The treatment of gambling as a moral vice no longer applies since gambling has become an important part of the economy.*Italy looks really idealistic in the movie, but Mussolini's brutal occupation of Libya and Ethiopia calls that into question.The point is, Disney's Pinocchio is a product of its time. An enjoyably weird version of the story is the 1975 Soviet movie Adventures of Buratino, based on The Golden Key, or the Adventures of Buratino, Aleksey N. Tolstoy's retelling of the story. Even though the movie got made under Brezhnev's stagnation, it's basically Pinocchio meets The Partridge Family. Seriously, it's one of those movies that makes you think What am I watching? Equally kooky were About Little Red Riding Hood (in which Little Red Riding Hood acts demented) and Mary Poppins, Goodbye (yes, there was actually a Soviet version of Mary Poppins).Anyway, we can accept this movie for what it is.
