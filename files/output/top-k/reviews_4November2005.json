I haven't laughed that much during a movie since a long time. The movie was extremely fun and entertaining. The humor is slapstick\/cartoon like. It was like watching one of those old Hannah-Barbera cartoons. The comical sequences were constructed extremely well and the timing by director Blake Edwards was brilliant! I laughed and smiled my way through this movie.The story and the situations in this movie are just crazy! It's typical Blake Edwards like and the humor in it can be compared to his early Pink Panther movies. There are some unforgettable comical moments and situations. The movie features a great stereotypical Western Saloon fight in which everyone fights everyone and it also features a great good old fashioned pie fight. 2 fine examples of some hilarious and memorable comical sequences. The movie is truly supported by the highly fun musical score by Henry Mancini.The movie has an absolutely amazing cast. Tony Curtis is a perfect leading man and Jack Lemmon is highly entertaining as the stereotypical 'villain'. Lemmon plays a double-role in this movie, besides Professor Fate he also plays Prince Hapnik. I had never seen him playing a character(s) like this in a movie. It is extremely over-the-top of course but it's highly fun to watch and he seemed to had lots of fun playing in this movie. His dumb stereotypical henchman is played by Peter Falk, before he got fame for playing Lt. Columbo. Natalie Wood is also enjoyable in her role.Only thing that too bad about this movie is that it's too long. The movie is like two and an halve hours long. It's not that the movie ever gets boring or tiresome after a while. It's just that some of the events in the movie feel stretched out and are perhaps a bit overdone. They could and should had reduced the movie to keep it more consistent.If you like silly cartoon-like humor or are a fan of the Pink Panther movie's, than this is an absolute must see! As a matter fact, everyone should just simply watch this movie!

The great thing about the Halloween series was how true to its roots it managed to stay. Every other horror franchise from Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street sold out long before they hit a number 5. Freddy Krueger suddenly became a comedian and Jason did the same routine in every movie with a different cast. The beauty of Halloween though was that it managed to stay scary and not turn Michael Myers into a joke.This film destroyed all of that.The biggest mistake is in the writing. The main arc of the entire series was Michael and his family. This movie focuses on that part of the story for maybe 15 minutes in the beginning (with Jamie Lee Curtis returning as Michael's unlucky little sibling), then veers so far off course it makes you wonder how a franchise can go down the toilet so quickly. The rest of the movie is just about a bunch of (annoying) college kids running around in a booby-trapped Myers' house with cameras as part of a reality show broadcast on the Web. Of course the kicker is that the REAL Michael Myers has decided to come back to his childhood home, and doesn't exactly like his new guests. We can't blame him.Every character here is stock. There's the goody goody you just know is going to be involved in the final chase scene, the sick perverted boy we all know is going to bite it, etc. They're the same characters from every other bad horror movie ever made. The previous Halloweens at least took pride in having good characters you actually cared about. It meant something when they died. Now all you can do is cheer Michael on as he slashes his way through some of the most annoying characters.The acting isn't nearly up to par, either. I realize this is the 8th film in the series, but who are these people? They can't act their way out of a paper bag, did the casting department just stop trying, or did these people win their roles through a contest or something? I'd like to know. Whenever the characters scream or try to show fear, it's so badly acted you just have to laugh at the comedic value of it all.In fact, at the halfway point of the movie you'll be laughing (or crying possibly) at how easy it is to take a respectable series and drag it through the mud.The only saving grace is Rosenthal's direction and the oddly good cinematography. Rosenthal does his best with the crap script he's been given, I doubt anyone could have improved upon it. And the cinematography is really quite great...the lighting and color of some shots are outstanding for a film of this type and the whole movie is bathed in orange and blue hues. I like it! Good stuff.Unfortunately that can't save this movie.This is basically just Friday the 13th in a house. Kids come around, masked killer shows up, kills them all of one by one. That's it. This movie alone managed to turn a once clever and meaningful series into a standard run-of-the-mill slasher movie. The main focus of the entire series is gone. Now we get hilariously bad acting, cheesy scares, and nauseating one-liners (the previous installments never resorted to comedy).Busta Rhymes steals the show though, with acting so bad it makes you afraid for all the wrong reasons.Just pretend this franchise ended with the at least respectable H20 and forget this travesty ever happened.R.I.P.

Obviously, I went into this film knowing that I was letting myself in for something truly terrible - but even so, nothing could prepare me for just how BAD this is. To be honest, I'm still in shock - how ever did this film manage to get a release? How did Ed Wood ever dare to make a movie with that script? How the actors dare to even be a part of it? All of these questions and more remain unanswered, and all the foggy elements surrounding the movie are matched by the huge amount of unanswered questions about the movie's plot. One of the many things that Ed Wood doesn't seem to have any grasp of is plot coherency. Some of the plot holes on display are so large that you could shove Tor Johnson into them, and still have room for at least three more terrible actors. The film follows the popular fifties idea of aliens landing on earth. These are actually the most stupid aliens ever to be seen in a motion picture, and the plan that they've cobbled together proves that. They want to destroy Earth, yet they want the 'earthlings' to believe that aliens exist, and the only way that they do that is by resurrecting the dead. Basically, Ed Wood wanted to make a movie about aliens and zombies.Many people give this train wreck plaudits for being 'fun'; but personally, I've only ever been more bored watching a movie once, and that was while viewing The Blair Witch Project. Some of 'unintentional humour' is actually quite funny, and I couldn't help giggling after the film had ended; but I don't watch films to laugh at how crap the director is, and the fact that there's no characters, plot coherency, decent acting or anything else just renders this film a very torrid time indeed. This film is famous for being the last one that Bela Lugosi ever made; even though he's only in it for a few seconds, while some guy in a cape fills in for him after his death; which is probably the most ridiculous death sequence ever to grace the silver screen. The rest of the cast are equally terrible, with Vampira and Tor Johnson standing out the most, but only because they look so stupid. The film kicks off with a narration sequence, and this really sets the right mood for the rest of the movie. The voice-over is so unbelievably cheesy that it's hard not to cringe every time it features. I realise that this movie isn't meant to be taken seriously, but as far as I'm concerned; Ed Wood has wasted seventy-five minutes of my time with this stupid film, and it really does deserve all the criticism it gets.

I have a little 9-year-old brother and it delights me to think that at least one little boy his age-in another galaxy or not-is not that horrible. Poor little Jake has suffered much criticism, i think he did a good job. After all, he was following a script and a young boy of nine can't be expected to be the best actor ever. Then there is Jar-Jar. i don't see why people don't like him so much. i think he is a fantastic character, though granted he is not my favourite. Yes, he is a little annoying at times, but some people seem to be incapable of using their imaginations! All the aliens in the star wars galaxy are different, unique. if they weren't it would be just plain boring. Star wars episode one was designed to introduce the characters of star wars... the famous Anakin and where he came from, the as yet unknown mother of Luke and Leia, Yoda, Obi-Wan and what the Jedi were before things changed drastically. It also introduces the idea of the Sith. Darth Maul wasn't such a bad character... Can anyone imagine him talking more then he does? It wouldn't be right. Yes, it is sad how the tradition of Talking through crossed lightsabers is broken, but whats to be said? You are weak! So... are you the master, or the apprentice. The Jedi council will be really interested to know. You will never defeat the Sith! No.... it wouldn't work, at least not for me. I loved the pod-racing. The sound they make as they round the bends, the aspect of danger that is portrayed, a little boy facing the odds with only the Force he doesn't even know.

The Bannister scene where their having out in a classic daughter, mother fiasco was all but McClaine....the heart to heart earlier in the movie when Streep comes in(past curfew which she knows better being middle aged and just getting out of a drug clinic)however not she is drug free, but yet this doesn't surprise her mother, McClaine figures she was up to no good. And yet this is another thing that bothers me throughout the film is when everyone in the cast, at least each character mentions Streep had just gotten out of a drug clinic and she isn't thinking rationally or she needs to reevaluate this or that....it really got to the part I wanted to just to sit and take each fingernail out one by one, it was just tedious, but yet , it was really the only flaw in the movie....oh wait, it wasn't necessary to put Dennis Quaid in the movie since these two had no chemistry , and a love you and then a one night stand, or lets make this two night stands didn't dish out too well as a smart , intelligent woman like Streep would've saw this a mile away.As for Nichols, he kept it simple, as though he did in the late eighties and early nineties and even to today. I don't think age has anything to do with it, but he is a sucker for melodramatic stories and his characters out stage his directing here....not saying he isn't a good director, because he is a fabulous director , but he keeps it short here and lets Streep and McClaine have fun with their characters and keep it lively and real. But if you want to see a Nichols film, I would recommend The Graduate or Who's Afraid Of Virginia Wolf? Shirley dominates her role in every turn, from the part where the drag queens idolize her, well pretty much drooling over her, to the ending of the picture where she puts it in her mind at last, to see her daughter cocoon as she did, maybe even knowing in the deep and darkness of her subconscious her daughter had maybe the same , if more potential and ambition after all.Streep....well she did get a Oscar nomination....do I agree....as long as McClaine got one too, but she didn't, but it's OK, this is just more Hollywood nonsense! A movie that tells you that addicts can find love too, or that they can change and they can even go back from the beginning and search for that one thing that reminded them in the end what it was all worth.....love....and Postcards From The Edge determined to show addicts like Streep herself and lil ol' Shirley, the alcoholic that can control herself are indeed people and change is somehow in their process of rehabilitating!!!

The Bannister scene where their having out in a classic daughter, mother fiasco was all but McClaine....the heart to heart earlier in the movie when Streep comes in(past curfew which she knows better being middle aged and just getting out of a drug clinic)however not she is drug free, but yet this doesn't surprise her mother, McClaine figures she was up to no good.

Capra's themes come back to haunt us, much like the haunting play Our Town, where the young dead wife gets a chance to re-live one day, one easy day in the life of a 12-year old. Here, we see what life would be like without George. We all suffer our own existence, yet like George with his own personal angel, we all have our little angels ringing bells reminding us that we have purpose in our suffering. In It's a Wonderful Life, we get to see that George's simple purpose, in his small town Savings and Loan, is a kind of microcosm of the greater good, a greater good that is possible in all of mankind.

I'm glad I did. I've heard good things about this movie, but didn't know too much about it. Never the less I really liked what I saw. This is truly a timeless classic and one of the best films there are.Benjamin Braddock is an insecure 21 year-old who has a scholarship and a future a head of him. He just don't know what he want's to do with that future. He get's involved with Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's partner and long time family friend. Then one day the Robinson's daughter comes back home and after spending time with her, Ben sees his life heading in a new direction.The story is great. It's a story that can be cute, funny, dramatic and intriguing. The screenwriter makes use of these possibilities and does so well. The story is well written and the characters are great. You get to love them and hate them and you get to understand their behavior. There's good drift in the story and you get interested and want to watch the rest.Dustin Hoffman is excellent and nothing less. His portray of Ben Braddock is great. I don't think I've seen him deliver such a performance ever (not in those of his movies I've seen). Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson is also great. She gives her character life (or lack of) in a great way. The rest of the cast also lives up to the leads and delivers great performances.Like several films in the 60's this makes use of songs that would later become radio hits rather than a classic score. It works excellent. I, however, didn't like the way they played Scarborugh Fair three times in a row with a couple of minutes in between, but it still does the job very well and the rest of Paul Simons songs fits this movie like a glove. It sets the mood and is something more to listen to then just a score. It's different and it's excellent. The other sound work is also very good.The cinematography is really a gem. The lightning is just nice and the composition of the shots are good. Only thing that pulls the cinematography down one point is some odd zooms that not always fit in, but that's not a big issue and apart from that it's excellent. The editing is also really good. There are some pretty nice transitions at one point and the rest of the film is nicely chopped as well. It's technically very good and very enjoying to watch.The Graduate is a timeless gem. I saw it and didn't think for one second that this is the 60's. The theme is timeless and there are no particular references to the 60's. That makes this move great and enjoyable still today and I hope for generations to come. This is in my opinion a movie everyone could watch and enjoy.

I'm glad I did. I've heard good things about this movie, but didn't know too much about it. Never the less I really liked what I saw. This is truly a timeless classic and one of the best films there are.Benjamin Braddock is an insecure 21 year-old who has a scholarship and a future a head of him. He just don't know what he want's to do with that future. He get's involved with Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's partner and long time family friend. Then one day the Robinson's daughter comes back home and after spending time with her, Ben sees his life heading in a new direction.The story is great. It's a story that can be cute, funny, dramatic and intriguing. The screenwriter makes use of these possibilities and does so well. The story is well written and the characters are great. You get to love them and hate them and you get to understand their behavior. There's good drift in the story and you get interested and want to watch the rest.Dustin Hoffman is excellent and nothing less. His portray of Ben Braddock is great. I don't think I've seen him deliver such a performance ever (not in those of his movies I've seen). Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson is also great. She gives her character life (or lack of) in a great way. The rest of the cast also lives up to the leads and delivers great performances.Like several films in the 60's this makes use of songs that would later become radio hits rather than a classic score. It works excellent. I, however, didn't like the way they played Scarborugh Fair three times in a row with a couple of minutes in between, but it still does the job very well and the rest of Paul Simons songs fits this movie like a glove. It sets the mood and is something more to listen to then just a score. It's different and it's excellent. The other sound work is also very good.The cinematography is really a gem. The lightning is just nice and the composition of the shots are good. Only thing that pulls the cinematography down one point is some odd zooms that not always fit in, but that's not a big issue and apart from that it's excellent. The editing is also really good. There are some pretty nice transitions at one point and the rest of the film is nicely chopped as well. It's technically very good and very enjoying to watch.The Graduate is a timeless gem.

It was Valentine's day, 1999. I couldn't really tell you about the boy, because I don't remember much about him at all. I only remember walking out of that movie theater with such an incredible sense of awe. I felt as though I understood so much more about Life, Death, Love, Loss and Courage.No movie had ever touched me like What Dreams May Come and to this day, that is still the case. I am now 19 years old, and I watch it at least once a month. Sometimes more. I still laugh and cry as if I have never seen it before. The cast could not be better, and the story is one you will never forget.The more love you discover throughout your life... The more this movie will mean to you. It changed me. Made me stronger. I never thought that I would ever say that about a movie, but all the same, it's true.The score, composed by Michael Kamen is just as amazing. Subtle and powerful at the same time. I would recommend both the movie and the soundtrack to everyone I know... Oh wait... I have!
