The time of the mods has long since passed and for most people only lives on through music by bands such as The Who or Yardbirds (who appear in the film) or movies like Blow-Up. Antonioni's Blow-Up is set in mid-sixties or mod London. The very same time and place that was parodied in Austin Powers It is here we meet the main character Thomas (David Hemmings). He is a professional photographer and he's quite good at it. Thomas may not seem cool by the standards of today's audiences who are often subjected to less cerebral entertainments. At its time of release it was the most successful art house movie of all time, was nominated for two Academy Awards, and was generally viewed as the best film of 1966. Many have never heard of it today. Some feel that it is dated but after a recent viewing I felt I was being transported to this time and place. There are not many movies that truly create a setting and a mood, but Blow-Up certainly does. If you were to find yourself walking down the street and you heard someone say fab or call a purse diabolical you might laugh to yourself at the ridiculousness of such absurd slang, but as the film settles around you the speech of these characters no longer seems absurd. The dialogue here is witty and sharp such as when the girl in the antique store tells Thomas, Money is always a problem. The dialogue is also somewhat sparse and is usually load-bearing. POSSIBLE SPOILERS For the first forty-five minutes of the film we settle ourselves into Thomas' world. He is cool but he is also detached. He takes pictures of models and has women more than willing to sleep with him so that he will photograph them later but he is indifferent to this. The only two women he seems to care about is his next-door neighbors girlfriend who he may or may not be in love with and Vanessa Redgrave's character. He eventually tells Redgrave You look at a pretty girl and that's that. Thomas leads a glamorous life but somehow it is empty. He is looking for substance in life or at least something to care about . He eventually finds it. He is working on a book that will mostly feature photographs of the homeless. One day he heads to the park and ends up taking some pictures of a couple. The woman sees him and chases after him demanding that he give her the film. Later she tries to seduce him to get the film back, but he purposefully gives her the wrong roll. When he develops the photos from the park he sees that he may have actually photographed a murder. This awakes him out of the stupor and monotony of his daily life. Roger Ebert says that he feels that the movie is mostly about how people are only truly fulfilled when they are doing what they are best at and that is certainly valid. I also felt, like many others that the movie was at least partially commenting on how sometimes the things we don't see are the most important. SPOILER The teens participating in Rag Week playing tennis with an invisible ball certainly indicate the importance of visibility. As they play tennis with not visible ball or rackets we hear the sounds of tennis in the background. Is it important that we can't see the ball? No because the teens can and perhaps so can Thomas. Blow-Up never gives us a definitive solution to the mystery or a climax to the suspense. For me what makes this movie special is simply how well its photographed, directed, acted, and written. Some feel it is over-rated, but I disagree, I feel that those of us who have been charmed and entertained by this forgotten masterpiece want simply to proclaim its greatness to the movie-going public. If there's time for another Fast and Furious movie, there must be time for a great film like Blow-Up.

It also has some really annoying animated effects. Not a good thing to open with, perhaps it's done to lower expectations or something. The second story turns out to be pretty good (by comparison at least), it's really entertaining and has a good twist to it. It makes no sense that the bellboy would get to the wrong room given the lights on his control panel, but that's just details. Then come the parts the audience showed up for, the ones directed by people they've ever heard of. Robert Rodriguez gives us a rather good segment, which gets better towards the ending. Nothing special though, decent and nothing more. Tarantino's is by far the best segment, and involves some of his typical situation comedy and dialogues. The outcome is also brilliant and unexpected. But what I like most about this movie are the pieces that tie it all together, which have a neurotic Tim Roth acting neurotic. Seeing him acting out his bizarre character is the most fun to be found in this movie, it's a really cool kind of over-acting.

I found myself liking it more than I ever did before. Was it the fact that I was feeling nostalgic or does the film really stand some test of time? I am more inclined to go with the second choice. I watched through and was impressed with Heston's acting - always found him to be a good actor. I was impressed with the attention to detail by Boris Sagal the director. I thought how a film like this must have been a nightmare to make back then. They used Los Angeles as the desolate setting for an apocalyptic novel about one man surviving some kind of germ warfare. At night you had some mutant survivors try and kill him. The city then in the day shots must be barren of humans and their collective presence. This film gives us this most impressively with not one micro-atom of help from the computer. The script is the only problem I have ever had with the film. The Omega Man is another adaptation of that wonderful science fiction novel I Am Legend by Richard Matheson. The first version was the Italian film with Vincent Price called The Last Man on Earth. Though I have always felt - and still do - that that film is a better film, The Omega Man has much to offer and maybe its script is growing on me as I age and seem to be more preoccupied with the stuff of anxieties more. In fact the first half of this film is quite excellent as Heston shows us what a day in his life is like. We feel his loneliness, his pain, his strength to survive. We vicariously race down emptied streets, throw away cars and clothes in this consumer heaven, watch a movie seen more time than would like to be counted, and play chess with a bust of Julius Caesar. Definitely not the kind of bust Heston wants to make moves on! Night brings dangers and the film gets a bit melodramatic in some spots here, and the music, the lingo, the attitudes are 100% seventies\/late sixties, but all that, for me at least, add to the film rather than detract. Sure some of The Omega Man is cheesy. Some of the script is lacking. The second half of the film isn't always quite sure where it is going or want it wants to achieve. These are credible arguments, but the first half of the film is outstanding, the direction is crisp and taut, and Charlton Heston shows why=he is an actor's actor giving a fine performance basically acting off himself throughout much of the film.

It probably does matter if you have come to identify with the hero and have recognized his driven, obsessed personality, but if you haven't, and the editing itself doesn't grab you, there's not much to discuss about the matter, you like it or you don't.The problem of the story is another matter. First, it's odd that the complaints are frequently contrary - either too complicated or too straightforward. This raises the question, what kind of story these differing complaining audiences expect from a 'police procedural' movie. It also raises the question of whether the latent political issues of the film are coming through to such audiences, since the complications of the story really derive from the class conflict between the blue-collar detectives and the criminals who enjoy wealth and influence. And its important that none of these complaints either account for, or show interest in, the fact that the core of the narrative is that of an actual narcotics investigation of the middle '60s.Finally, most of those who give the film a bad review utterly ignore the personality issue - the film is, to some extent, a character study of a street-smart cop who has no life and who has become too obsessed with his job to get it done properly - the American mobsters get busted but the 'French connection' himself gets away.These issues also have political ramifications. Director Friedkin is obviously wary of being too blunt on the matter, but in the actual events from which the film is derived, the only criminals who got jail time were those without money and influence; the real-life 'French connection' was allowed to disappear back to France because he happened to be a war-time buddy of Charles DeGaulle. And the $30,000,000 heroin shipment finally did reach the street by leaking through an increasingly corrupt New York City police department - which showed its gratitude to the detective who broke the case (Popeye Egan) by firing him without pension for 'behavior unbecoming' without hearing (he later sued and won).I don't know, somehow I find such stories, or episodes from them, and their ramifications, inherently interesting. If you don't, this film is probably not for you.But just as a film, it must be said that there's a rugged, even occasionally crude but always energetic, craftsmanship on display here.

It probably does matter if you have come to identify with the hero and have recognized his driven, obsessed personality, but if you haven't, and the editing itself doesn't grab you, there's not much to discuss about the matter, you like it or you don't.The problem of the story is another matter. First, it's odd that the complaints are frequently contrary - either too complicated or too straightforward. This raises the question, what kind of story these differing complaining audiences expect from a 'police procedural' movie. It also raises the question of whether the latent political issues of the film are coming through to such audiences, since the complications of the story really derive from the class conflict between the blue-collar detectives and the criminals who enjoy wealth and influence. And its important that none of these complaints either account for, or show interest in, the fact that the core of the narrative is that of an actual narcotics investigation of the middle '60s.Finally, most of those who give the film a bad review utterly ignore the personality issue - the film is, to some extent, a character study of a street-smart cop who has no life and who has become too obsessed with his job to get it done properly - the American mobsters get busted but the 'French connection' himself gets away.These issues also have political ramifications. Director Friedkin is obviously wary of being too blunt on the matter, but in the actual events from which the film is derived, the only criminals who got jail time were those without money and influence; the real-life 'French connection' was allowed to disappear back to France because he happened to be a war-time buddy of Charles DeGaulle.

The basic plot of HIGH NOON is fairly simple In the western town of Hadleyville, New Mexico, word arrives that bad man Frank Miller is out of prison and headed back to town aboard the noon train. The just retired sheriff, Will Kane, puts off his plans to leave town with his newlywed bride in order to face the returning outlaw and his gang. But Kane can't put together a posse to defend the town; all the townspeople, while largely respectful of Kane, are either too afraid or are otherwise sympathetic to Miller. Thus, Kane is left to stand alone against the Miller gang and their threats of apparent violence.In Foreman's vision it can be assumed that the Miller gang represents the House Un-American Activities Committee and all the conservatives who took an overtly pro-active stand against the threat of communism. Kane represents the few outspoken liberals who stood up to the bullying and found themselves alone in the street as the cowardly masses (the townspeople) hid in fear. Thus the irony is that Foreman wrote an allegory hoping to promote subliminal leftist propaganda as a means of rebuking the conservative assumption that liberal filmmakers might introduce subliminal leftist propaganda into their work.But quite unintentionally, the film illustrates the flawed thinking behind McCarthy-era hysteria and behind any noble and\/or sinister plans that Foreman might have had. The film can just as easily be re-interpreted so that the Miller gang represents the communists and their sympathizers, with Kane symbolizing bravely patriotic conservatives &#x96;- left standing alone in the street as the cowardly masses hid in fear. Indeed, this so-called communist western is rife with elements that are strongly, if not uniquely, American; not the least of which is the central character of Will Kane. Strong and determined, albeit also fearful and uncertain, as played beautifully by Gary Cooper, Kane stands as a noble symbol of tough American leadership &#x96;- be it liberal or conservative. Driven by a sincere sense of responsibility, Kane bravely stands his ground, even as many of the citizens of Hadleyville encourage him, indeed, beg him to leave. The socialist image of strength by the uniting of the individuals is pretty much brushed aside.Thus, there is the flaw Make it too obvious and the propaganda becomes too weighed down in its profundity. Make it too subtle and it might not even be noticed. Make it too generic and it becomes so open to interpretation that the message might be meaningless. In the end, the propaganda is only as successful and meaningful as an audience will allow it to be. Thus, as a message movie, HIGH NOON is of minimal value; it is embraced for exactly the opposite reasons that its creator intended. But as a western movie, the film both embraces and rejects the ethos of the genre. In the end, there are many things to admire about the film -- and things that justify John Wayne's notorious disgust with it -- but being pro-communist isn't one of them.To some extent, HIGH NOON is the thinking man's western. Until the very end, there isn't much action in the film; but there is a lot of discussion, bargaining, theorizing and explaining. To some degree, the story would work as a play. As Kane goes from one to another, all the townsfolk have their reasons for not standing with the sheriff some are afraid, some have families, some too old, some too weak. Some just don't see it as their fight to fight. The cowardly masses aren't so much cowardly as reluctant to look for trouble. In a way, Kane isn't just the last defense against encroaching trouble, he is the lightning rod that attracts it. The war with the Miller gang is his battle, it is part of a war that he took on, even if it was on behalf of people who ultimately turn their backs on him. His feelings of betrayal by his fellow man are just, made all the worst by the realization that he really can't argue with them and has no means to force them to help. And that, oddly enough, is what makes the film so American.In the traditional western, such as Wayne's RIO BRAVO, they might be reluctant to take up arms, but in the end the citizens would stand up for what is right. And they would do so for their own reasons. In HIGH NOON, the citizens refuse to help, also for their own reasons. Wayne's view of America might be more positive and Foreman's more negative, but they both see the same America; a country based on the right of individuals to decide for themselves, free of the heavy hand of governmental power. It is that freedom, which for better or worse, makes America. Foreman sees that as a flaw, not a simple American reality. The townspeople may be wrong to refuse to help, but it is their right. Whatever the consequences.HIGH NOON is a revisionist western. John Wayne's beloved image of the west, wherein the sharing of hardships binds the citizens together is supplanted by a new image, where the successful establishment of a town separates and disunites the citizens. Brave as he may be, Will Kane is also foolish in believing that by making their battle his battle during dark days that they will continue to follow his lead when times are good. In giving the townspeople the safety of civilization, Kane has also given them the freedom to question his wisdom and to say no to his pleas. In the end, like so many leaders, Kane leaves town, bitter and forsaken; feeling his sacrifices are unappreciated, his victory empty.Is it any wonder that HIGH NOON is the favorite film of American presidents, be it Bill Clinton or George W.

Yet somehow it never live up to its pretensions.The beginning was almost a cliché of the genre, in which Hawke as naive rookie gets treated with cynical contempt by his street-wise bad-ass mentor, Washington. The whole thing has a slightly de-ja-vu look about it, as other equally good movies resonate in one's memory. But just as it begins shuffling towards Boredom Street, the plot quickens and undergoes a dramatic and unexpected shift. A likable bad guy, played by reliable Scott Glenn is ruthlessly slain by the mentor (who has clearly crossed the line) in punctuation for stealing his $4million stash. The whole thing is rigged to look like a shake-down that went wrong. It certainly gets your attention. Needless to say; the rookie wants no part of it and declines his share in the pay-off. You know from that point on that a collision course is inevitable. Later this rookie is left in the hands of a bunch of homicidal Hispanics who have evidently been paid by his mentor to whack him. He survives this experience by a coincidence that borders upon the supernatural and is rather hard to take seriously. Still; he does, and now goes after his 'villain' mentor. After that we are back to formulaic again. The ending is as weak as the beginning. Our rookie survives, the mentor gets wasted (by Russian mafia types) there's a brief off-camera newscast voice-over explaining that he's a 'hero' cop who died in the line of duty, blah,blah, blah.A group of shady senior law officers referred to as the Three Wise Men and who are also evidently rotten as hell - of which Tom Berenger is wasted in a cameo role - are never seen or heard from again. It's a very incomplete and unsatisfactory denouement. I'm left thinking that the money or the celluloid just ran out before the story could be wound up.You can see hints of 'Serpico' - which is more believable, 'The Rookie' - which is more fun, 'Deep Cover' which is more gripping, and one or two others. This work is adequate. The script is decent; acting is mostly good; location, lighting and sound do the business. Editing seems a bit choppy at times.

He lives alone on a boat in a marina near Wilmington, outside of L.A. But after being contacted by the sister of the young woman who supplied his new heart, he feels obligated to pursue the case. The police and the other agencies of social control of course discourage him, wanting to slough the case off. But there are a few personal friends who warily lend him support. He investigates the case, while his friendship with the donor's sister grows into a more intense relationship.The murderer is discovered and dies violently at the end, but he and his motive are both perfunctory. (He was responsible for Clint's new heart because he wanted to continue the game they had been playing. Eastwood seems attracted to scripts in which he and the criminal share some sort of bond.) There's some interesting casting. The LAPD lieutenant is Hispanic and at one point shouts angrily at Eastwood that his organ came from an Hispanic woman and What a waste of a good Mexican heart! He also warns Clint that if things go wrong he'd better sign up for an ***hole transplant because he's going to tear him a new one. The character uses his ethnic background but there's nothing politically correct about it.Similarly, the victim's sister is Hispanic but she's not one of filmdom's raving Latina beauties or insinuatingly appealing women like Rachel Ticotin or Elizabeth Pena.

The cast includes Van Heflin as Joe Starrett, Jean Arthur (in what is to be her final film appearance) plays his wife Marian and Brandon De Wilde as their little boy, Joey. The Starrett family alongside many others are living in the vicinity of a small community with no established law. In other words, trouble flows frequently and the peacemakers of the bunch find themselves and their property threatened by wild and stubborn cowboys, who harbor an intent to drive the settlers out of town.Meanwhile, a cattleman named Ryker (Emile Meyer) wants to buy the Starrett property, but Joe is adamant in his decision and refuses. Leaving him with no alternative Ryker sends for an infamous gunslinger named Wilson to take care of Starrett, but Shane ultimately intervenes and saves the town from overpowering corruption.Shane is a movie about conflict; about how one man, a stranger, can put a troubled town back on its feet and, at the same time, change the standing of one family. The showdown between Shane and Wilson, played by Jack Palance, is short, quick and to the point. Palance has such a strong presence as Wilson, yet all it takes is a single bullet. That scene looked and felt like a real showdown. It is a beautiful looking movie with wonderful cinematography, not to mention a story that really gets into your heart.

I was most impressed with it's brilliant use of Technicolor cinematography and the dazzling displays of swordsmanship, with many action sequences well placed from start to finish.As others have mentioned, it's hard to picture anyone else in the role of the title character other than Errol Flynn, so it was a surprise to learn that Warner Brothers' first choice for the lead was James Cagney. Cagney however played hardball with the studio, so they went with the actor who made such a splash in 1935's Captain Blood. I tried picturing Cagney in the green tights and involuntarily began to chuckle at the image, but Flynn and his cohorts seemed to look ideal in their outfits. Flynn's natural athleticism is certainly on display here; the scene that really surprised me was the one where he grabbed the rope of the castle gate, the weight of which hauled him to the top of the barricade as he scrambled up for an even better vantage. I guess it could have been a stunt double, but it sure was an impressive maneuver.I recall seeing a documentary on Steven Spielberg stating that he took some of his inspiration for the 'Star Wars' franchise from pirate and adventure flicks of the 1930's. That's certainly evident in the light saber scenes we're all familiar with, but what I noticed here was how much the hooded cloaks of the Jedi Knights might have been modeled after the garb of King Richard the Lion-Heart and his men. Something to think about.I've seen Basil Rathbone before primarily in his portrayal of detective Sherlock Holmes, and only in black and white pictures of the era.

The film was hardly a masterpiece (the story and some of the characters were fairly unrealistic, many easy-to-notice and major bloopers), but the films finer points over powered the weaknesses.Jurassic Park was basically a special effects demonstration, but a well crafted one. With that said, Jurassic Park III has more in common with its predecessor than many would give it credit for. However, JP III lacks the fore mentioned finer points that made the original work. The acting is flat, quite flat. Even Jurassic Park veteran Sam Neil, who gave a solid performance as the charter Alan Grant in the first film, is stiff in his acting this time around. The other issue is the film's pace. Jurassic Park had suspenseful timing. It would build up tension and then release it at well chosen moments. Jurassic Park III tries to just throw dinosaur themed action at you as fast as it can, without effectively building up the moment. As for the story, well it is actually pretty lame. It is a sad excuse for a sequel plot.The cinematography in Jurassic Park III isn't poorly done, but it can't compare to the cleverness of Jurassic Park's constantly iconic and dramatically chosen points of view. Not all in this movie is bad. The dinosaurs themselves don't disappoint. If anyone in Jurassic Park III should be nominated for best actor, it should be one of its CGI or animatronic cast members who are actually more convincing than the flesh and blood human cast. There are moments when it is a real challenge to tell apart the late Stan Winston's practical dinosaurs from Industrail Light and Magic's CGI ones. It is a pure delight to watch the roaring, hissing, winged, and clawed creatures interact with the scenery, fight, and destroy on the screen. If only they could tear apart the lame story and dull characters in the process...

There have been many changes to the genre over the last couple of decades, perhaps the most significant when the genre went digital with the psychologically frightening Blair Witch Project. But as times grow many horrors are spurned with little effect on the viewers who expect someone hiding with typical music and degrading stereotypes, for example The Hole.Psycho, released in the early 1960's, may have lost an edge in sharpness with technology inevitability taking control over scares but the shock and drama encoded remain intact and is still a favourite amongst horror fanatics and the shower scene is still debated as one of Alfred Hitchcock's best.Starting off Psycho sets Janet Leigh and John Gavin debating their future and soon Leigh has money and sets off on her own. This act of selfishness and greed brings viewers right up to scratch as her angelic image is far from her devilish actions and we soon have a thriller on our hands. And soon we also have Anthony Perkins to contend with.Perkins brings a sharp and twisted shock to the story with a disturbing portrayal of a lonely man wanting company and as we see his stalkerish obsession mixed with his bizarre hobby we dive right into the infamous scene and the shock will surprise and entertain you with a swirling and dramatic depiction of the consequences by Hitchcock.Again the English director shows a sharp intensity in story telling with fast moving montages and a clever use of bird eye view angles to capture the shocking story in its full intensity.This horror drama has one of the finest musical scores I personally have ever heard for such a genre. The opening sharp cut title sequences and credits role with a finely established mixture of sophistication and sharpness that generates a feeling of excitement and tension to set you up for the film.As far as horror films go these days you will see a helpless stereotype waiting for the inevitable to happen. Therefore it is refreshing to know that some classic horrors will still shock and surprise and Psycho is at the top of that list.
