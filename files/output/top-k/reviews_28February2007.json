[{"date":"28 February 2007","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" A film by a director from India staring an actress from Australia in a story about one of Britain's most well-known monarchs. But hey, it works. This is a lavish costume drama of a semi-historical account of the Ascension to the thrown and the early years of the reign of Elizabeth I. Henry VIII is the second Tudor king and after his death his son the Protestant Edward VI becomes a boy king but dies as a teenager. Edward's cousin, the Catholic Jane Grey becomes the regent queen for nine days and is executed and the Catholic Mary I who is the daughter of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon becomes Queen. Mary in the five years of her reign earns the title of Bloody Mary for executing more people than had been executed in the previous century and a half. Childless, she dies of ovarian cancer and her half sister, the Protestant Elizabeth who is the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, becomes Queen Elizabeth I also known as Gloriana, Good Queen Bess and the Virgin Queen. Elizabeth is also the sixth and last Tudor monarch. This film is filled with castle intrigue, the fight for power, and the religious clash between Protestants and Catholics in a post Henry VIII and post Reformation world. Cate Blanchette who had only appeared in a handful of films won acclaim for her staring role in the film Oscar & Lucinda is cast in the title role of Elizabeth which earned her her first Academy Award nomination. This film has a great ensemble cast. Joseph Fiennes is Robert Dudley the Earl of Leicester and Eliabeth's true love interest. Geoffry Rush is Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's spy master and adviser. Christopher Eccleston is Thomas Howard, the Duke of Norfolk, one of the most powerful men in England. Richard Attenborough is Sir William Cecil, Scretary of State and Elizabeth's chief adviser. Fanny Ardant is Mary of Guise the Queen Consort of Scotland who also seeks the throne of England. Vincent Cassel is Duc d'Anjou who is being considered as a possible husband for Elizabeth. Kathy Burke is Queen Mary Tudor who hates her half sister Elizabeth and once had Elizabeth imprisoned in the Tower. John Gielgud, in his final film, has a very brief on screen role as The Pope. The film can be a little confusing as it takes a dramatic license with history and tries to fit too much into a two hour run time. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Original Score, Best Art Direction and Best Makeup winning only the Oscar for makeup. Shekhar Kapur directs a script by Michael Hirst with beautiful cinematography by Remi Adelfarasin. John Myhre and Peter Howitt create stunning sets in art and set decoration and Alexandra Byrne designs elaborate period piece costumes. Jenny Shircore wins the film's only Oscar for makeup but had this not been up against some other particularly strong films for 1998 it would have won more. Director Kapur, cinematographer Adelfarasin and writer Michael Hirst have reunited for the sequel The Golden Age with Blanchette reprising her role as Elizabeth and Rush back as Walsingham. I would give this an 8.0 out of 10 and will look forward to it's sequel in which Sir Walter Raliegh will be a principal character.

Years later Wallace (Mel Gibson) returns back to the farm of his father to fall in love Murron (Catherine McCormack), the same girl who gave him a flower after the burial of his father and brother years ago. Because the English noblemen have the right to deflower every new married girl, Wallace marries Murron in secret. But the young luck won't last forlong. A few English soldiers try to rape Murron at a marketplace. Wallace tries to rescue her but the agressors can catch her and kill her right on the marketplace.

It has so much, it does so much, and it delivers in so many ways, you cannot really describe the experience. Legend of Drunken Master stands as Jackie Chan's best film, and arguably the greatest martial arts film in history. That's right Bruce Lee fanatics, it tops most\/arguably all Lee films. Surely Lee had the strength and the power; but did not have the ensemble cast that Chan had, nor did Lee have any fights that can top the ones the Drunken Master engaged in throughout the 105 minutes of this kung fu madhouse.With a decent plot, good acting, and a dash of humor to go along with the frenzied action, Legend of Drunken Master is one of those rare complete martial arts films that do more than just throw fights at you. Honestly, there has yet to be a perfect martial arts film. Whether its bad acting, a weak plot, too much focus on action, a pointless romantic story attached, or way too over-the-top substance, there hasn't been a martial arts film worthy of being up there with the best films in the modern era. Jui Kuen II (as they call it overseas) is the closest to the complete package as you can get.We start the film off with Jackie Chan as the tough yet uncontrollable young kid by the name of Wong Fei-hung who accidentally takes a seal from British smugglers. The smugglers, also involved in overworking Chinese men in a factory resembling slave-like sweatshop of some sort, want the seal back. In the meantime, Wong's controversial fighting technique, drunken boxing, has been met by disapproval of his father, and wants him to refrain from ever using it. Drunken boxing also has a lot of competition and shun from others in the community. Chaos follows as soon as the British and their henchmen find out who has the seal, and vow to do whatever it takes to get it back and to spread fear in the community.The plot isn't groundbreaking, but its something different than the average martial arts film. While it still contains the themes of family, honor, respect, and dignity contained in most Chinese movies of this genre, the preservation of Chinese art is a concept not used often. Nonetheless, it works, as we see the traditional values of the Chinese being threatened by the more modern mechanisms of the Europeans. There is also a major issue with honor, as Wong's father is morally against drunken boxing, and hates it when his reputation is damaged even a little. The acting involved with the tension amongst Chan and his family is at times a bit overblown, but for the most part gets the job right.Jackie Chan is one of the few actors\/actresses in modern cinema history that can both be taken seriously and lightly. We see Chan at his playful side, especially when he is drunk. But, take away the smile, watch him pose, and you will fear him. Seeing that look in his eye right before a major fight starts can send shivers down your spine, as you know he will not back down easy, and will use whatever technique necessary to take you out. His physical appearance isn't exactly intimidating, but his agility and amazing ability to be balanced and whip out an insane combo of punches and kicks remains to be matched by anyone else out there. The best of Chan is here in terms of acting, usage of props, and kung fu. Don't let his usage of props fool you, he can engage in a brutal victory without the use of any objects. Few Jackie Chan films prove this, but Drunken Master has its share of fights without any other objects floating around.The fights are what Chan is best known for, and the fights are where the film excels towards jaw-dropping levels. From the first fight, involving swords and extending from underneath a train to a nearby house, to the final fight that lasts over 10 minutes without exaggeration; Drunken Master will wow you, will keep you on the edge of your seat, and will make you almost jump back in amazement. Hollywood does not have enough patience to spend four months on one fight alone, which is why we don't see fights in action films like the ones seen here. The final fight, involving a well-trained kicker and Chan at his drunkest stage is easily one of the best fights in history&#151;it's so well choreographed, so well-timed, and so brilliantly executed, that it deserves a spot on one of modern film's greatest achievements. Raising the bar for generations to come, the last fight mixes speed, agility, humor, combos, fast movements, and unbelievable stunts. In truth, all the clashes prior do the same, but this one puts all the others to shame.Bottom Line Missing this film would be a travesty, especially if you enjoy a good martial arts film. This time its not Chan alone that makes the film; we have a good cast of characters and fighters, a decent plot, and never really drifts into an unbelievable level unlike most action movies of today. This is Chan at his absolute best; and this is famed director Chia-Liang Liu at his best. Almost a complete package in terms of quality and substance, Legend of Drunken Master is as close as you can get to martial arts perfection; and remains the greatest martial arts film of all-time.

While it still contains the themes of family, honor, respect, and dignity contained in most Chinese movies of this genre, the preservation of Chinese art is a concept not used often. Nonetheless, it works, as we see the traditional values of the Chinese being threatened by the more modern mechanisms of the Europeans. There is also a major issue with honor, as Wong's father is morally against drunken boxing, and hates it when his reputation is damaged even a little. The acting involved with the tension amongst Chan and his family is at times a bit overblown, but for the most part gets the job right.Jackie Chan is one of the few actors\/actresses in modern cinema history that can both be taken seriously and lightly. We see Chan at his playful side, especially when he is drunk. But, take away the smile, watch him pose, and you will fear him. Seeing that look in his eye right before a major fight starts can send shivers down your spine, as you know he will not back down easy, and will use whatever technique necessary to take you out. His physical appearance isn't exactly intimidating, but his agility and amazing ability to be balanced and whip out an insane combo of punches and kicks remains to be matched by anyone else out there. The best of Chan is here in terms of acting, usage of props, and kung fu. Don't let his usage of props fool you, he can engage in a brutal victory without the use of any objects. Few Jackie Chan films prove this, but Drunken Master has its share of fights without any other objects floating around.The fights are what Chan is best known for, and the fights are where the film excels towards jaw-dropping levels. From the first fight, involving swords and extending from underneath a train to a nearby house, to the final fight that lasts over 10 minutes without exaggeration; Drunken Master will wow you, will keep you on the edge of your seat, and will make you almost jump back in amazement. Hollywood does not have enough patience to spend four months on one fight alone, which is why we don't see fights in action films like the ones seen here. The final fight, involving a well-trained kicker and Chan at his drunkest stage is easily one of the best fights in history&#151;it's so well choreographed, so well-timed, and so brilliantly executed, that it deserves a spot on one of modern film's greatest achievements. Raising the bar for generations to come, the last fight mixes speed, agility, humor, combos, fast movements, and unbelievable stunts. In truth, all the clashes prior do the same, but this one puts all the others to shame.Bottom Line Missing this film would be a travesty, especially if you enjoy a good martial arts film. This time its not Chan alone that makes the film; we have a good cast of characters and fighters, a decent plot, and never really drifts into an unbelievable level unlike most action movies of today. This is Chan at his absolute best; and this is famed director Chia-Liang Liu at his best.

It has so much, it does so much, and it delivers in so many ways, you cannot really describe the experience. Legend of Drunken Master stands as Jackie Chan's best film, and arguably the greatest martial arts film in history. That's right Bruce Lee fanatics, it tops most\/arguably all Lee films. Surely Lee had the strength and the power; but did not have the ensemble cast that Chan had, nor did Lee have any fights that can top the ones the Drunken Master engaged in throughout the 105 minutes of this kung fu madhouse.With a decent plot, good acting, and a dash of humor to go along with the frenzied action, Legend of Drunken Master is one of those rare complete martial arts films that do more than just throw fights at you. Honestly, there has yet to be a perfect martial arts film. Whether its bad acting, a weak plot, too much focus on action, a pointless romantic story attached, or way too over-the-top substance, there hasn't been a martial arts film worthy of being up there with the best films in the modern era. Jui Kuen II (as they call it overseas) is the closest to the complete package as you can get.We start the film off with Jackie Chan as the tough yet uncontrollable young kid by the name of Wong Fei-hung who accidentally takes a seal from British smugglers. The smugglers, also involved in overworking Chinese men in a factory resembling slave-like sweatshop of some sort, want the seal back. In the meantime, Wong's controversial fighting technique, drunken boxing, has been met by disapproval of his father, and wants him to refrain from ever using it. Drunken boxing also has a lot of competition and shun from others in the community. Chaos follows as soon as the British and their henchmen find out who has the seal, and vow to do whatever it takes to get it back and to spread fear in the community.The plot isn't groundbreaking, but its something different than the average martial arts film.

Its 1901 look shares features with theirs, as do some of its story elements. Everyone knows practically everyone else; and the very fact that such towns are not the sort of place where important thing happens renders what does happen peculiarly intense, as if it had been placed under a magnifying lens in a powerful light. Author Thornton Wilder and his co-writers here adapt what was a most successful and atmospheric play into a deliberately-paced by I suggest an absorbing screenplay. It has the build perhaps of Picnic with the underlying calm of a good early western; only the setting here is Grover Corners, New Hampshire, a decidedly northeastern setting.. Sam Wood directed the film with his usual understated skill; and the writers I believe have retained the best of Mr. Wilder's crisp and often memorable dialogue. The film really divides into three parts--which I would nominate as Introduction, George and Emily and Two Futures(?). George Gibbs and Emily Webb in this film become two of the best remembered characters in U.S. fiction. Sol Lesser produced, with music by Aaron Copland, whose repressed melodies seem to me perfectly to serve this understated masterwork of dramatic construction. Production designer William Cameron Menzies and cinematographer Bert Glennon here tried for an uncompromising atmosphere rather than quaint or merely attractive compositions. Julia Heron did the remarkable interiors, with simple but effective wardrobe by Edward P. Lambert. Among the cast, Martha Scott is wonderfully young and unspoiled, and as Dr. Gibbs, Thomas Mitchell plays with Fay Bainter as his wife more-than-expertly. As their neighbors Editor Webb and his wife, Guy Kibbee is unusually restrained and Beulah Bondi as usual solidly dependable or better in every scene she is given. Stuart Erwin ad Frank Craven (as the stage manager) are quite good, and young William Holden shows to much better advantage than he did in several other films of the period. The supporting cast is not given a great deal to do but they do it very seamlessly, in my opinion. But what one remembers of Our Town I assert is its haunting, almost poetic quality. The production's pace is leisurely without being slow, electrically tense without being excited and focused without becoming too sad. The story here is about life, death, youth, love, honesty and fear--and the narrative evokes these emotions in the viewer honestly I claim because it is never pretentious and never striving for the effect that it admirably earns. It is I argue a touching black-and-white classic; and it is quite well acted also throughout._____________________________________ ","genre":null},{"date":"28 February 2007","score":"12 out of 12 people found the following review useful","review":" Like Harvey, The Second Woman and Good Morning, Miss Dove, Our Town is set in an underpopulated United States town.

So, what makes this action movie so much better ? To begin with, it has Mel Gibson. This is one fine actor who shines in every role he plays , but the thing that makes him especially delightful to watch is the fact that he does not bother to be suave or eloquent in any manner,but chooses to play his act as he did the first time- that of the out-of-control,devil-may-care cop who doesn't bat an eyelid before shooting at the bad guys, and to hell with all the laws of the land. His version of the hero cop remains an original which has not been imitated by anybody till date. Probably because no one would be able to pull it off the way Gibson did! It is the first factor that makes the Lethal Weapon series the classic that it is. And then comes the Danny Glover factor. There has not been a more humane cop on the silver screen . He brilliantly portrays the warm , doting father who loves his job as much as he loves his family.When hew gets furious over the fact that his daughter is in a commercial for condoms, we not only laugh but also sympathize with him too. I do not think that any other actor shared the same chemistry with Gibson as Glover did.The rest of the cast are just sideshows, but one cannot overlook Joe Pesci. He is as humorous and lovable as he always is, and his inclusion in the plot makes for some very funny moments. And yes, who can forget the glamorous Patsy Kensit ? Her role is brief, but nonetheless,memorable. All things considered,this is one film that will remain a model for any director who wants to make an entertaining,absorbing action flick without CGI or doses of casual sex thrown in for good measure.

The scenery is off the charts, as the South American setting is beautiful and even more beautiful the next minute. Costumes and production values are also first rate. If you decided to skip this film because of the off camera controversy generated by the movie, please think it over once more. To pass over this film is to miss a truly fine work in the annals of outstanding movies of the nineties. Period.

Quite intense. Campbell Scott's Vincent is a tortured young man who only wants to live enough to prepare himself for death. Julia Roberts' Hillary is essentially her Vivian from Pretty Woman (I hope everyone who sees this film is as unimpressed as I was with the shameless allusion to Pretty Woman when Hillary steps off the bus in -- gasp -- a red suit), but it suits the film well. But the passionate acting from Roberts, yes, but mostly Scott absolutely rends one's heart. When Hillary declares that she thought this guy was going to die, the audience is right there with her. Scott's performance is so rare and so special during these opening minutes because he is not self-pitying. He is aware of his disease, and he's trying to fight it. He's beyond emotional pain, and as he struggles through the physical pain, we start to feel it too. By the time Victor announces that his treatment is finished and he's ready for a vacation, the audience is ready for one too--it's really too much to watch a character we're instantly so attracted to come so close to death so many times.However, with the change of scenery comes a change of momentum. This is not surprising considering how emotional the opening third of the movie is--I'm not sure any movie could sustain that degree of intensity for the length of a feature film. Sadly though, the couple's time in the beach house becomes, as one critic put it, a kind of music video which features long shots of endearing moments between the two main characters. I would have liked to see more *real* discussions, interactions, etc. between the two than the endless close-ups of their pretty faces. The townsfolk are superfluous--essentially they're stock characters, cut-outs of real people that serve no real purpose in the film. Vincent D'Onofrio's Gordon is the most confusing character of all. He seems to have some sort of flirtation with Hillary, but this is never developed, explained, or resolved. A shame, as it could have added more drama to a section of the film that was sorely lacking in any sort of dramatic effect.The ending of the movie isn't bad, but it never quite recovers the momentum of the earlier section. However, I find that no matter how much I dislike the middle part of the film, I keep thinking about the film as a whole, and really really liking it. If you're prone to it, this film will probably make you cry. If you're not interested in tears, it's still worth watching because at the very least it will make you appreciate how lucky you are to not be going through what Vincent goes through--not having to make the decisions or sacrifices he makes each day.I recommend watching it at least once and forming your own opinion.

It doesn't stop there..Allan feels what Ella feels and others around him see his behavioral changes which are unlike him such as outbursts of anger and profanity. Allan tries telling others about his link with Ella, but you can understand why they might be worried about his state of mind.

Maryanne has a parrot which flies into Allan's unprotected face too often and will suffer for it.The longer the film continues, the more it induces eye-rolling..the premise is so outrageous and preposterous, it's hard not to chuckle. It is one of George's most Hollywood-ish films often allowing contrivances so that Allan will escape dangerous situations when Ella goes on violent. The whole link between man and primate thanks to an experimental concoction by Geoff is never fully explained satisfactorily leaving a gaping plot hole that is a wart to what the film is trying to accomplish. It's one thing to let a monkey get away with what Ella does, but another to ask us to believe that Allan feels and sees what she does. Thankfully Kate McNeil is a delightful, welcome presence in the film bringing some class to a rather mundane Romero effort.

He is a good actor, almost a certainty when you talk British actors, and funny in all the best ways. You can be funny in a silly way or you can be a great comedian, as John Cleese is. He perfectly plays an old-fashioned English barrister, being his formal life a joke itself.Michael Palin is Cleese's partner-in-crime in the Pythons. He plays a funny role, as his character is the last thing you'd point as a delinquent. His struggle with his stud adds to the fun, but again, not in a cheap way.His nemesis is played by Kevin Kline. His s the case of those actors that have a different personality with a moustache (here) or without (Cry Freedom). He plays Otto, who hates being called stupid.Jamie Lee Curtis, at her best, plays the girl of the film. She is a bit of a teaser in pursuit if her own ambitions. Along Kline, Palin and Tom Georgeson (called in the film George Thomason)form the criminal gang.Without giving away any of the plot, and though probably most people has already seen it, I can say there's a robbery. To cover the crime, the gang try all sorts to divert the evidence and create several minutes of laughter.I must have seen this film over 10 times, and I enjoy every time. It was such a success the 4 main actors tried to recreate the chemistry in this masterpiece in 'Fearce Creatures', but this didn't work.

Because of Scorsese's fatal drug addiction, he didn't expect much more and he didn't expect to get back on track. While making Raging Bull while he suffered from the addictions, he was more than on track and he was more than on top of the game. Scorsese put on a master work as he skillfully developed enough will and strength to make Raging Bull, in the top 100 here at IMDb. This is a crown jewel, which really reminds me of Scarface (mainly because of the swearing) however, this was more meaningful than Scarface. You can't have everything when you're worried about everything. Raging Bull teaches us how easily we fall into the snares we originally set up for ourselves and how easily we fall prey to our own disasters. Scorsese has put on a lot of great films over the years and I'm looking for many more to follow from his directing. Raging Bull, I would have to say, was his best film yet if you take into account all the factors. Keep in mind, Scorsese was in a different mindset. Everyone is when thy're on drugs and I'm sure he couldn't function as well as someone he wasn't on drugs but we saw perfection from Raging Bull. We see Scorsese was also determined to prove something, to overcome the insurmountable odds that were stacked against him. However, people function better when backed into the corner. Regardless, this is still a great film, whether it be Scorsese's greatest of all time or not and we can still appreciate it regardless of how it was directed and made on.

The novel is considered as one of the greatest works of science fiction of all times. The story happens on a distant future, in a feudal intergalactic empire, where the planetary feuds are controlled by noble houses who owe obedience to the Emperor. The hero of the film is the young Paul Atreides, heir of the Ducado Atreides, responsible for the exploitation of the spice melange, in the planet Arrakis. In a story that explores the complex interactions between politics, religion, ecology and technology, the fate of Paul, its family, of Arrakis and its native inhabitants, as well as the fate of Emperor Padishah, of the powerful Space Corporation and of the mysterious female order of the Bene Gesserit, all finish linked in a confrontation that will change the course of the humanity. Frank Herbert made a great innovation in DUNE, upon using psychological, religious, philosophical and ecological elements, that were up to that time rarely used in science fiction. One of the most interesting characteristics of DUNE is the feudal atmosphere. The noble houses rule the stellar systems, its feuds. There are no robots or computers. All technology is analogical or biological. It has thus a valuation of the human figure and of the political and social intrigues. The film includes Kyle MacLachlan as Paul Atreides and a series of well known European and American actors in the supporting roles, like Francesca Annis, Sting, Jose Ferrer, Virginia Madsen, Pretty Hunt, Patrick Stewart, Max von Sydow and Jürgen Prochnow. David Lynch was chosen by producer Raffaella di Laurentiis, after she had seen The Elephant Man. At that time, Lynch was receiving several invitations, including oner for directing The Return of the Jedi. The filmings began in 1983 with a budget of more than 40 millions dollars. The first version had more than 4 hours and the final version approved by Lynch lasted around 3 hours. But Universal Pictures wanted a cut only two hours long, that could be more apellative to the public. Thus, the producers Dino di Laurentiis and Raffaella di Laurentiis and the director David Lynch had to remove several scenes and simplify sequences. The film premiered in the 3rd of December of 1984 and the expectations were great. In the first place, it was the adaptation for cinema of one of the most popular novels of science fiction. On the other hand, the director David Lynch, had several successes, as Eraserhead or The Elephant Man. The movie was was not well received by the critic and by the public, generating an income well below what was expected. Even David Lynch, in a certain way, denied the film, saying that the final cut was not of his responsibility and that the producers restrained him from having the artistic control of the production. He said I began selling me with DUNE. Looking backwards, I should admit that the fault was mine. Probably, I never should have done this film, but I saw so much possibilities. I could create an entire world. But I received immense indications from Raffaella and Dino di Laurentiis about what kind of film they expected and I could not make the final cut. The movie only obtained 27 millions of dollars in the box office. Given the total costs of 42 millions, it was considered as a finantial flop. As a result of the commercial failure and of the bad reviews, the foreseen sequels were cancelled. The critic was very hard with the film. For example, Roger Ebert wrote This movie is a real mess, an incomprehensible, ugly, unstructured, pointless excursion into the murkier realms of one of the most confusing screenplays of all time. And added that it was the worst film of the year However, with the elapse of the time, the film has been looked in another way, becoming a cult film and being praised by many new critics.
