Most of all I love the fact that everything seems to be quite dysfunctional for these characters in this movie, however, instead of moaning and groaning about it, they instead do something about it the only way they know how and fight back against the norm of society and stereotypes of society. Good for them. They may not have used the standard, conventional, by-the-book way of getting things accomplished, but nonetheless, it worked...well, I might add. But without giving too much information about the finality of the film, I will say this up until the last 10 minutes or so, the viewer thinks one thing and one thing alone. But as the ending plays out it sheds a TOTALLY different life about every single aspect of the movie. Really was a classic and ground-breaking finish. This is a must see in my humble opinion. Enjoy the masterpiece, it is delightful and very different than one may originally expect. Kudos to the individuals who directed, produced, wrote, and had anything else to do with the production of this film. It is indeed an ageless classic.

He thought that cinema is all about (Stanly Kubrick) only ! What's wrong about some glamour time? In fact, it's so right. Having a fun time is what movies were grounded on. And still are to a considerable extent; if only well-made. And in the case of (Charade), it is very well made.First of all, the script. I adore it. Look how it creates a real charade by making a story of a crime, a conflict of evil associates which leads to more crimes, with dividing the truths, hiding them, then giving them away one by one, to design a movie of non-stop murders, surprises and twists all along. Not only this, it mixes violence with sex, or let's say sex appeal, when leading this thriller hand in hand with a romantic comedy that has snappy smart lines. So the catchy formula perfects. I bet Hitchcock was jealous !Add to that the star value. Ahhh, it can't get any better than this. (Audrey Hepburn) is a dream, especially in that blue pajama. She had that iconic face and humor, lighting the screen with a smile, a gaze, or maybe a scream. And (Cary Grant) is the very definition of this movie, as a combination of sparkle and magic. He's a load of charisma, fun, vitality. The thing is you wouldn't believe his performance only; you have to fall in love with his persona also. Very few stars in the history of cinema can reach this zenith while being in their third act (Grant was 59 year old at the time, and he retired from movies for good &#x96; after couple of more movies &#x96; in 1966). 3 moments of him had his stamp utterly, forcing you to re-watch them with increasing fun every time; showering with his suit on, picking the orange competition (where Hepburn was laughing for real I suppose), and the funny face he came up with at the last scene; which was very much the best parody out of the audience's reaction towards this heavy long run of twists up to that point (which was very early for a movie back then). The rest of the cast is fine to say the least, with their different looking and speaking characters.Then, the magic continues. A music score by (Henry Mancini). That guy was elegance to movie music. He wrote, as usual, a fascinating theme. And this time it could be played whether as interestingly suspenseful or tearfully romantic. I loved the way it's played in the dining boat scene; with a vocal version of it, or in the amusement center scene; as a part of the place's music, like the whole movie is amusement center. Why writing a theme song to be played in different arrangements throughout a movie seems so old and forgotten these days ?! Undoubtedly it was part of yesterday's special charm. The cinematography is pure cozy, rather analgesic with deeply worm colors. It's the classically dazzling Hollywood movie image back then. (Stanley Donen)'s directing did very good. The fight over the building is memorable. Mixing the on-location shots with the in-studio ones was done adeptly. Yet I think that the best thing (Donen) achieved here was his 2 leading stars' so smooth performance and interplay.Though, (Hepburn)'s character was unconvincing. I didn't buy her as someone under stress or afraid for most of the time. She was having fun, falling in bottomless love with (Grant)'s character, and not having the slightest problem at all, which was a problem for me, the only problem this movie has in my viewpoint.There are some nice references along the way  mentioning American in Paris by (Gene Kelly) who's an old friend of (Stanley Donen) (they co-directed together 3 classic musicals On the Town &#x96; 1949, It's Always Fair Weather &#x96; 1955, and Singin' in the Rain &#x96; 1952). Or a line like I taught them everything they know, said by (Grant) about the young lovers' kisses, not as his character in the movie, but as himself; the romantic lead of countless movies. In terms of references to himself, (Grant) didn't feel shy admitting his age, and for more than once (the glasses to read is one), I think at the time he held a position of a movie star that allowed him to be (Cary Grant) more than his character here, whatever its true name was, and the movie friendlily toyed with that for honoring purpose. The last scene has it all. The 2 stars shine with magic. The boy, old boy, speaks to his girl about marriage; assuring that every love story has to end with marriage (notice the decorous time; which I personally love and long for). And it's the movie's last surprise, twist, whatever.. when (Grant) turns out to be a government agent; now see how that script played with the cards brilliantly, switching them to make the real thief (Walter Matthau) as the policeman, and the real policeman as the thief (Grant doesn't stop lying from the start about his identity, deciding &#x96; until this moment &#x96; that he's a thief). Sure this was the script's best game, and it saved it for last.This is nothing but great entertainment. It's full of magic's sparkle or sparkle's magic, well, you name it. At any case, worth the love, the DVD, and the fight with that snob professor! P.S  Don't care much for the remake (The Truth About Charlie &#x96; 2002) (Yes, they had the guts to remake THIS !). Enough to tell that they handed over the role of (Cary Grant) to (Mark Wahlberg). Wh@%t t*e F#^k????!!!!!!!!!

The others do nothing to intrigue me, but I am a fan of zombie films, so this was a must-see in my book... The film actually has a story. Yeah, every film has a story, but this has much more depth than that. The world is ruled by a corporation called Umbrella, and to add to that, the film has tons of underlying messages and outlooks. But sadly, film's have to rely on execution, so I didn't have the highest of expectations, especially looking at the score. Safe to say, the film does things right. The opening sequence was brilliantly done, and interestingly one of my favorite opening scenes in any movie. The film does tend to get a little confusing, and a bit too much sometimes. Sometimes they almost forgot they were showing the world ruled by a greedy corporation, but this was only some scenes. I admit some scenes were super awesome, and I was on the edge of my seat. Examples the entire 'laser scene' and the last scene. But sadly, some scenes all relied on pure action. Examples the scene where Alice shoots up the zombie dogs, and ironically they had to place a hard rock song in there too. There were only flaws here and there, and thankfully didn't send the film downward to pure nothingness. In fact, I recommend it. If your a hardcore zombie fan, and enjoy a story as well, this could be your cup of tea. The film sometimes relies on hot chicks and rock music, but the rest is nothing you'd expect. If your expecting a horror film, your out of luck. The film relies on pure action survival, and it's a good one at that, but only for a select few. PS, if your looking for more films like this one, I highly recommend Zombieland.

While Zombieland is a comedy, and your expecting that, than your going to love how it combines our today's raunchy comedy and zombie films. 7\/10.

The directing is wonderful, the plot is interesting, and the pacing throughout is spectacular. This is one of those films that is very hard to dislike, in my experience even younger audiences with lower attention spans or those who dislike black and white films have, with very few exceptions, really enjoyed this film.One aspect that I want to single out is the editing and pacing, which stands out as some of the best I've ever experienced. All but a very few scenes take place in the jury room, and yet the film is edge of your seat material throughout. More than that, every single time I watch it I feel as the jurors feel. It starts out slow, like there's nothing to deliberate. When the jurors begins speaking a little more seriously, a little more angrily, you can feel your heart beating faster. Then the tension builds even more and just when I feel like I can't handle any more, the jurors take a break and walk around the room and cool off and wipe sweat off their brows just as I do while watching. The pacing is absolutely perfect, the fact that so many films are filled with gratuitous sex and constant violence and yet fail to enthrall me like this film, it speaks volumes as far as the quality and greatness of the film in all areas.The most criticized element of the film is the ending (which I won't spoil) and really the entire process that is begun by Juror #8 (Henry Fonda), which is kind of out of bounds as far as how a jury is supposed to work. In real life, yes, what happened in the jury room, would probably have been enough for the whole situation to have led to a mistrial. But this criticism really misses the point of what is something of a message movie, although not in an obnoxious way.

Ocean's Eleven is a smart, breezy caper comedy that glides along on enough wit and cool, jazzy energy to make you enjoy getting snookered by the pretty boys.Clooney is Danny Ocean, a con man who just lost four years and his wife to a term of confinement in the New Jersey penal system. Now he wants to get even, with interest. He plans a scam involving himself and ten confederates, including right-hand man Rusty (Pitt), targeting three of Las Vegas's richest casinos in a single evening for a nine-figure haul.Asked why, Danny shrugs and says it's because it's never been tried. Frank Sinatra and his Rat Pack would say otherwise, but this Ocean's is cooler, funnier, and more suspenseful than theirs. Normally I'd rather watch Frank and Dino than George and Brad, but the latter two made the better film.Ted Griffin's script and Steven Soderbergh's direction do a lot to sell you on a clever if shaky plot. When Danny asks his wife Tess (Julia Roberts) why she dumped him, she responds with a line that keys in on the way the picture operates You've met too many people like you. Danny, Rusty, and their merry criminal associates seem to communicate mostly through nods and one-liners, not wasting time explaining things.I owe you for that thing with the guy in the place, is how one of the Eleven, money man Rueben (Elliott Gould), puts it to Danny. This in-the-know argot works for everyone else, too.A lot of movies try for the big ensemble cast, but this one finds the right balance between star power and character performances. My favorites Andy Garcia as a standout bad guy and Carl Reiner as the oldest, most sympathetic member of the Eleven.While there's not a lot of depth, you hardly mind when what you see and hear gleams and purrs the way Ocean's Eleven does. Eleven is both a puzzle picture and a love letter to Vegas at the turn of the 21st century, with its dizzying array of gaudy monstrosities and gyrating dancing girls. The music is a frothy stew of Elvis, Perry Como, Berlin, and Debussy. It pulls you in, and keeps you from thinking too hard until long after the credits roll.Yet I find Ocean's Eleven more enjoyable on re-viewings. I say this despite the plot holes in the way things work out. Plot holes or not, Ocean's Eleven puts care into how it works. You get to actually enjoying how the film sets up its misdirection plays and basks in the impossible smoothness of the lead characters. And the dialogue is hilarious.**SPOILERS BELOW***** SPOILERS Everyone has noted one thing I missed, the stacks of flyers that magically appear inside the vault. But about Danny spending all that time being beaten up in that guarded room, especially when the lights go out? Aren't there too many witnesses to trace Danny and the others to the scam? And what about the mini-scam played on young Linus (Matt Damon), when he is told Danny has been taken out of the operation, only to be surprised when Danny greets him inside an elevator?

He made his films always with this regard at the forefront. From Snow White, to Bambi, Dumbo and all of the other classic tales that he lifted from folklore and history, and, like a deity of animation, breathed life into characters that were once trapped on pages in library books.Cinderella is no different, and we see a gentle and simple tale of honesty come forth as the young girl who means no harm to anyone must overcome adversity aimed at her in the form of jealousy. An active attempt to keep her down and in her place as we see a contest of power among sisters in name only. There is almost a kind of Jane Goodall quality as we see the new matriarch push aside the offspring of the father's previous love so that her brood can benefit from the resources created by the previous marriage. Cinderella, the once much loved daughter of the household, is now relegated to servitude. But even here her spirit cannot be quelled. For in her labor lies love, and her friends, the various fauna that populate the household grounds and walls, keep her spirits up. She is isolated from people and society, but soldiers on.It is a basic story telling of how seeking consolence from another object of affection can adversely effect that which one loves; i.e. the father remarrying someone whose motives are less than altruistic. But, in the end, it is the stalwartness of the royal seneschel who knows only that his duty must be performed at the behest of the crown, for therein lies honor. And it is thus that Cinderella sees that her one moment to shine has been rewarded through an artifact of military etiquette.It's a lovely film to watch and see. There're no real deep messages, but the story reminds us that delving hastily into new relations where matters of the heart are concerned, can be perilous if the previous party has been wounded. But, it also shows us that it is trusting your heart that brings about, for lack of a better term, good things. It is a story that reminds us that opportunists may crush that which we hold dear, and unless a miracle is forth coming, the likes of which Cinderella experienced, bad things may continue to persist.Technical notes; lots of inbetweens to show us animation so smooth that nothing has been rendered like since CGI, and even CGI comes across as highly mechanical and precision oriented, a raw juxtaposition from the innate intuition of the artists who animate with gentle feeling. This is what makes Cinderella such a beautiful visual for us to sit, watch and absorb.

Does he think he is someone special, above the rest of the town, above even the preacher? Maybe the town had it right, in the first place.As the hotel clerk said, It's good for business. And everyone knows what's good for business is good for America. This gang would have spent their hard earned money in town, thus creating jobs. And as job creators, they would have been entitled to be elected to public office, unlike those liberal do-gooder politicians, whom we all know are crooks. This is the American way. The way of High Noon is the commie way. The movie was probably funded, directed and written by Kremlin stooges, like so many other commies who infiltrated Hollywood at the instructions of the USSR, spreading the gospel of godless individualism, questioning Americanist morals and winning Oscars. It worked look at the moral decay that has spread through America since this movie was released. The commies know all too well not to show such immoral fare in their countries; you will never see High Noon shown in Red China. They put individualists and free thinkers in jail or simply execute them. We could learn a thing or two from their example. Joseph McCarthy and Richard Nixon should have taken away the union cards of (F)Red Zinnemann, Karl Marx Foreman, and Gary Pinko Cooper, banned them from ever working in Hollywood again, and, in my opinion, put them in jail for being un-American, like they did so many other Hollycommies. If you are a good, God fearing Repubican, do not watch this movie. Do not allow yourself to be corrupted by the ideals of individualism, of standing up for what you believe in in the face of unanimous opposition, at the risk of your life. But feel free to write scathing reviews without watching it. I didn't.

So there is Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime doing what he does best in movies. There is just some obvious plot-holes in this that comes off just absurd, especially how in the movie a TV program can alter and change news to what they want. Just about nothing in this movie makes any sense sometimes.

Where they don't kill each other but has to run and fight these killers that work on the show that has weapons. But the runners have no weapons and have to use there environment and sometimes the items the killers carry in order to survive. The thing is this movie starts out sort of interesting and entertaining which is about the first 30 minutes. And that is before the main Running Man show with Arnie starts, but when the game begins I started to find myself lose interest. It's just predictable and boring to watch and nothing really grabbed my attention. If the absurdity in this movie doesn't bother you as much, you just might enjoy this movie a bit more. The build up can lead some audiences to believe the Running Man is going to be really entertaining show, especially with the viewers in the movie going bonkers for the show in the movie.

It's a nutty family, with a great performance by the father (gravelly voiced Eugene Palette in what may be his best role). The other sister is well played by Gail Patrick, who often played the other woman, but here played a slightly devious sibling that isn't totally unlikable.

The car chase with the helicopter and Jack Walsh's final moment over the ravine with the same helicopter are just terrific.The music is terrific too and has remained so in a way that many 80's film soundtracks haven't.Okay there, so if you like films to be great on technical level, you have a masterclass in every department.If you don't care much about excellence on a technical level and just like a good story well told, Then Midnight Run is one of the most wonderful, warm, engaging, funny, exciting and most satisfying stories you are ever likely to encounter. I mean it, whoever you are, YOU. WILL. LOVE. THIS. FILM.Oh but there is LOTS of swearing which I personally found hilarious and though virtually constant, always so expertly written and delivered it somehow never felt gratuitous. Just funny.

I know there have been other attempts over the years, but The Mummy comes the closest to hitting the mark.The Mummy, directed by Stephen Sommers, is the story of librarian and aspiring archaeologist Evelyn (Rachel Wiesz), accompanied by her brother Jonathan (John Hannah), enlisting the help of French Foreign Legion soldier Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) to find a lost Egyptian city. I prefer not to say more as this type of plot is best when the story unfolds before you.Sommers directing is fast paced. There is never a dull moment, never a talky interlude to break the tone of the action. Every scene in the film is necessary for the plot advancement. Director Sommers knows an inherent part of any action film is to keep the camera moving. There are very few static shots.The special effects, by ILM, are fantastic. I was hooked from the opening sweeping shot of a bustling city in ancient Eygpt, beautifully recreated.Brendan Fraser is a very credible action hero. As Rick O'Connell, he has such a clumsy, boyish charm you can't help but like him. With a half smile and his perchant for the understatement (You brought a new friend back from the desert, didn't you Beni?), he is almost the equal of Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones. Rachel Weisz is wonderful as the aspiring archaeologist Evelyn and John Hannah is fun as her near do well missionary brother Jonathan. Kevin J. O'Conner as scared of his own shadow Beni (I won't reveal what his role is in the story) is delightful.What keeps this film from being the equal of Raiders of the Lost Ark is the lack of character curve. Unlike Indiana Jones, who learned the hard way to respect powers he can't touch or see, I can't think of anything any of the characters in The Mummy learned.However, The Mummy is still rip-roaring entertainment. Sommers and Executive Producer Kevin Jarre (screenwriter, Glory) wisely created a film with an emphasis on action. They must have figured (rightly so) that any story about the Mummy presented to 1999 audiences would just not be scary, so the tone was changed to action\/adventure.Action films greatly rely on the ability to make the audience believe that what they see is possible within the first five to ten minutes. If this doesn't happen, the viewer will have a poor experience for the rest of the film. Most action films cannot achieve this. They shoot their bolt too early, rendering the rest of the film unbelievable. Also, the closer an action film is to related reality, the more difficult this becomes. Like Raiders of the Lost Ark (still my all time favorite action film), The Mummy allowed me to suspend my disbelief within the first ten minutes.

Yet if you watch this movie and see passed the dark sense of humour and ultra violence there is a story which is reflective of our world today.Robocop is a satire and a well thought out one at that. OCP represent the big corporations, Robocop\/Murphy represents the human spirit and this is the irony of the movie that despite Murphy becoming almost entirely machine by the company they could not destroy his human side. Murphy did not become a mindless, emotionless product that is Robocop!!His human emotional side was still too strong and Murphy's emotional journey as Robocop and losing his contact with his family give this movie depth which makes the original movie vastly superior to the hollow sequels that followed.So the analogy here is business, power, money and technology attempt to dehumanise mankind but showing that eventually human spirit will win the day and essentially this aspect is most important in life. An increasing focus in today's society I believe. In the final sequence of the movie this is emphasised by the Old Man asking Robocop what his name is, to which he replies 'Murphy'!. He was no longer the machine he was Alex Murphy the man!OK so I have now analysised this movie at its core but on a more superficial level this movie is fantastic action flick with humour added in bundles. It has some very violent scene which will stick in the memory especially the murder of Murphy.The Robocop suit special effects are brilliant, with his machine pistol style handgun being iconic and symbolic of the Robocop character. The acting is very solid and believable.

Look at the title of that play and it doesn't take a Shakespearean scholar to see where this is headed. Yes, this will be the story of the making of Romeo and Juliet. Not the true story but a fanciful notion of what might have been. And after watching this film you can't help but wish that this had actually been the way it played out. Because it's a great story. A smart one too, with a script so chock-full of brilliant little nuggets that Shakespeare himself would be proud. It's a story of forbidden love, Shakespeare weaving the events of his own life into the famous play we know so well. But along with the love there are laughs as we watch Shakespeare and his players struggle to bring Romeo and Juliet to life. And there are so many sly, witty references to other famous works of Shakespeare that it is probably impossible to catch them all. Like any great story this one requires great performers to give it life. Happily this film has great performers in abundance.Joseph Fiennes plays Shakespeare and captures wonderfully all the frustrations of a struggling playwright. He also makes for part of a great pair as Shakespeare struggles with his love which cannot be. The woman he falls for is Viola De Lesseps, a woman of privilege and, not incidentally, a huge fan of theater. She falls for Shakespeare just as hard and just as quickly as he falls for her. But unfortunately their love is doomed as she is promised in marriage to the rather odious Lord Wessex. Meanwhile Viola, huge theater fan that she is, is determined to play a role in Shakespeare's newest play despite the prohibition on women performers in this era. Disguised as a man she wins the part of Romeo. Shakespeare uncovers her true identity and their love continues to bloom even as she keeps up her charade. She is his inspiration, his lover and his lead performer. But her charade cannot last and neither can their love. Eventually, and inevitably, all hell breaks loose.The part of Viola, a dual role really, is a very challenging one to play and Gwyneth Paltrow does a magnificent job with it. She's a beautiful, radiant, charming woman who can slap on a fake mustache and a wig and fool everyone into thinking she's a man. A life with two sides and Paltrow is letter-perfect throughout. As a woman she's a wonderful lover. As a man she's a heck of a performer. Of course her dual life causes complications. It also causes laughs. This is not a film to leave you rolling in the aisles but there is a lot of good comedy here, and smart comedy at that. And while it is Fiennes and Paltrow at the heart of the story who are most responsible for carrying the film there are so many other fine performances here. As Queen Elizabeth Judi Dench isn't on the screen much but she makes the most of every moment she has. Such a great presence and she manages to provide some humor as well. Geoffrey Rush, Tom Wilkinson and Colin Firth all get their moments to shine. And playing a cocky, egotistical actor there's Ben Affleck, who plays the part with a knowing wink and plays it wonderfully. This is a film with a lot of charm and plenty of wit. Maybe it never hits the highest comedic heights but it will probably have you smiling throughout. Yes, as so many have stated, the fact that it beat out Saving Private Ryan for Best Picture is rather baffling. Doesn't mean it's not a good film in its own right though. The screenplay is brilliant, the performances are terrific. It makes for, if not Best Picture material, a thoroughly enjoyable diversion.

Like any great story this one requires great performers to give it life. Happily this film has great performers in abundance.Joseph Fiennes plays Shakespeare and captures wonderfully all the frustrations of a struggling playwright. He also makes for part of a great pair as Shakespeare struggles with his love which cannot be. The woman he falls for is Viola De Lesseps, a woman of privilege and, not incidentally, a huge fan of theater. She falls for Shakespeare just as hard and just as quickly as he falls for her. But unfortunately their love is doomed as she is promised in marriage to the rather odious Lord Wessex. Meanwhile Viola, huge theater fan that she is, is determined to play a role in Shakespeare's newest play despite the prohibition on women performers in this era. Disguised as a man she wins the part of Romeo. Shakespeare uncovers her true identity and their love continues to bloom even as she keeps up her charade. She is his inspiration, his lover and his lead performer. But her charade cannot last and neither can their love. Eventually, and inevitably, all hell breaks loose.The part of Viola, a dual role really, is a very challenging one to play and Gwyneth Paltrow does a magnificent job with it. She's a beautiful, radiant, charming woman who can slap on a fake mustache and a wig and fool everyone into thinking she's a man. A life with two sides and Paltrow is letter-perfect throughout. As a woman she's a wonderful lover. As a man she's a heck of a performer. Of course her dual life causes complications. It also causes laughs. This is not a film to leave you rolling in the aisles but there is a lot of good comedy here, and smart comedy at that. And while it is Fiennes and Paltrow at the heart of the story who are most responsible for carrying the film there are so many other fine performances here. As Queen Elizabeth Judi Dench isn't on the screen much but she makes the most of every moment she has. Such a great presence and she manages to provide some humor as well. Geoffrey Rush, Tom Wilkinson and Colin Firth all get their moments to shine. And playing a cocky, egotistical actor there's Ben Affleck, who plays the part with a knowing wink and plays it wonderfully. This is a film with a lot of charm and plenty of wit. Maybe it never hits the highest comedic heights but it will probably have you smiling throughout. Yes, as so many have stated, the fact that it beat out Saving Private Ryan for Best Picture is rather baffling. Doesn't mean it's not a good film in its own right though. The screenplay is brilliant, the performances are terrific. It makes for, if not Best Picture material, a thoroughly enjoyable diversion.

Look at the title of that play and it doesn't take a Shakespearean scholar to see where this is headed. Yes, this will be the story of the making of Romeo and Juliet. Not the true story but a fanciful notion of what might have been. And after watching this film you can't help but wish that this had actually been the way it played out. Because it's a great story. A smart one too, with a script so chock-full of brilliant little nuggets that Shakespeare himself would be proud. It's a story of forbidden love, Shakespeare weaving the events of his own life into the famous play we know so well. But along with the love there are laughs as we watch Shakespeare and his players struggle to bring Romeo and Juliet to life. And there are so many sly, witty references to other famous works of Shakespeare that it is probably impossible to catch them all.
