This time terrorists don't hijack ship but train full of passengers including the deadly cook Ryback (Seagal) and his niece Sarah. The terrorists are led by madman who was fired from the government in which he invented a military weapon that is used in space. He and his colleagues want now to avenge his firing and all the wrongs, and they demand huge amount of money in order to maintain the peace; the madman has all the equipment in the train to control his deadly invention above and he definitely is willing to use it if he doesn't get the money and co-operation from the helpless government. But he doesn't know Casey the cook Ryback is also on the train, and he is pretty p***ed of because his niece is in danger among all the other passengers.This film is a routine actioner with the usual charisma of Steven Seagal and his fighting abilities. Murphy does his job with talent as a director and there are some great bits of photography, for example the scene where the train is reflected in the lake and there are also some interesting camera angles in the film. The film is also pretty exciting (if not always believable), so I really managed to watch this without any problem, and the fact is that I'm not any fan of Seagal's. Under Siege 2 is very violent and has plenty of gun fights and fist\/kicking action and the film is incredibly roughly cut in UK to get the 18 rating. I watched the uncut version and it is raw and violent most of the time, if not as violent as Seagal's most brutal film, Out For Justice. Under Siege 2 Dark Territory is nothing special, but still pretty exciting, greatly directed, photographed and staged action film. There are some stupid comic elements and funny and irritating one liners, mostly from the bag boy, so without these stupid and usual flaws, this film would be even more noteworthy little actioner. Now it is among many others and makes the same mistakes in this department as many others have made, too. I give this 5\/10 and appreciate Geoff Murphy's direction.

The makings of a great drama are clearly there the beginning of the end of Anakin \/ roots of Vader, the love story, the rise of the Empire, the fall of the Republic, etc., etc.I was expecting too much it seems. Let's start with the good points the visual effects, as always, are simply stunning. The sound also makes for an amazing cinematic experience, it is really this sensory ride that everyone expects from the Star Wars franchise, and Attack does not fail to deliver on this point. At the same time, however, this visual \/ audio extravaganza almost takes away from getting more deeply involved in the film, the plot, the characters...(more on that later).The screen presence of Ewan's Obi-Wan is truly superb and is matched only by Portman's strong performance. Hayden does a decent job, but ends up being too whiney - (I guess that runs in the adolescent Skywalker genes - a.k.a. Luke in the original Star Wars) - and actually despite the audiences expectation that he will fall to the dark side, his ability to portray a convincing conflict between the force and the dark side was disappointing. I think it would have been far more powerful if he was truly a rising Jedi with superior talent, a greatness that somehow falls to the dark side.Instead, he is portrayed as a spoiled brat with an inflated sense of entitlement, yet there is no SUBSTANCE there (a recurring theme, hence my title). Wouldn't it have been far more powerful if he was a truly engaging, likeable leader who is ultimately destined to fall? As it is now, I almost want him to become the bad guy - its too easy - not complex enough - the viewer can handle this.Furthermore, Senator Palpatine is clearly Darth Sidious - why make it so obvious - another case of giving substance to the wrong areas - why not make Anakin's character more complex, darker, yet great?This comes back to Obi-Wan, the other Jedis and the Force in general. The force was such a central and critical theme to all of the middle trilogy Star Wars - why stray from this path? In fact, given the historical context in which the 1st trilogy plays out, shouldn't the Force not be an even greater force in these films? It seems to have become some kind of a punch-line like when Obi-Wan tell Anikan may the force be with you before his assignment. Disappointing.Finally, the love story. I thought that for a few scenes, the film was going to cut to a digital version of the Sound of Music and a bunch of aliens would come busting out of the hills singing Doe a Deer - NO!! If you want a simple lesson on how to portray a tense love story develop within the context of a SciFi - you don't have to go far - watch Empire Strikes Back and the scenes between Han Solo and Leia put the ones from Clones to utter shame.*** minor spoiler alert ***On the lighter side, it was great to see Yoda in action, but I have another slight complaint here Master Yoda is clearly revered as the most powerful Jedi, now when he comes up against Count Dooku (who is not even the Master equivalant) he actually puts up a draw against Yoda - to make the math stack up, Yoda should actually wipe the floor with Dooku...Finally, it was great seeing R2 and 3PO back in action, so all is not lost!In all, a decent film, that somehow got lost in all of the minor subplots and digitalization this trilogy should get back to its roots the Force, the Dark Side, the conflict between good and evil, the relationships between Master and apprentice, friends and enemies, the Yin and Yang philosophy that has made the first trilogy classics.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"15 July 2002","score":"","review":"  I'll admit that the title of my commentary may be a bit harsh.But after the Phantom Menace fiasco, I was really expecting a much deeper, more complex film. The makings of a great drama are clearly there the beginning of the end of Anakin \/ roots of Vader, the love story, the rise of the Empire, the fall of the Republic, etc., etc.I was expecting too much it seems. Let's start with the good points the visual effects, as always, are simply stunning. The sound also makes for an amazing cinematic experience, it is really this sensory ride that everyone expects from the Star Wars franchise, and Attack does not fail to deliver on this point. At the same time, however, this visual \/ audio extravaganza almost takes away from getting more deeply involved in the film, the plot, the characters...(more on that later).The screen presence of Ewan's Obi-Wan is truly superb and is matched only by Portman's strong performance. Hayden does a decent job, but ends up being too whiney - (I guess that runs in the adolescent Skywalker genes - a.k.a. Luke in the original Star Wars) - and actually despite the audiences expectation that he will fall to the dark side, his ability to portray a convincing conflict between the force and the dark side was disappointing. I think it would have been far more powerful if he was truly a rising Jedi with superior talent, a greatness that somehow falls to the dark side.Instead, he is portrayed as a spoiled brat with an inflated sense of entitlement, yet there is no SUBSTANCE there (a recurring theme, hence my title). Wouldn't it have been far more powerful if he was a truly engaging, likeable leader who is ultimately destined to fall? As it is now, I almost want him to become the bad guy - its too easy - not complex enough - the viewer can handle this.Furthermore, Senator Palpatine is clearly Darth Sidious - why make it so obvious - another case of giving substance to the wrong areas - why not make Anakin's character more complex, darker, yet great?This comes back to Obi-Wan, the other Jedis and the Force in general. The force was such a central and critical theme to all of the middle trilogy Star Wars - why stray from this path? In fact, given the historical context in which the 1st trilogy plays out, shouldn't the Force not be an even greater force in these films? It seems to have become some kind of a punch-line like when Obi-Wan tell Anikan may the force be with you before his assignment. Disappointing.Finally, the love story.

The film was shot on the Iranian-Afghan border (the Taliban, who were then in power, refused to allow filming in Afghanistan). Conditions were primitive. Makhmalbaf and his crew received constant threats and had to wear a disguise every day to survive. Yet, Kandahar succeeds in illuminating the extreme poverty and hunger in Afghanistan, the conditions of women who must hide their identity behind their burqas (veils), and the constant, daily threat of landmines left over from the Russian-Afghani War.

In a desperate bid to save her, Nafas decides to travel back to the city of Kandahar.

I don't care if I get attacked for my review on this piece of crap.  I am sick and tired of reading reviews of you true Halloween Fans about how good this movie is.  This movie is pointless. Now that Laurie Storde is dead there is no more story to tell.  Dr. Loomis is dead, everyone is dead.  There is Josh Hartnett but we all know he will not be in another Halloween film because he is too big of a star now.  So for the rest of the series we are going to be stuck with idiotic college students who have nothing to do with Michael Myers's past.  H20 had the perfect ending to the series, Laurie got her revenge and Michael finally was dead.  But that idiot MOUSTAPHA AKKAD got money hungry again and greenlighted this piece of garbage.  Like one reviewer said earlier that he regrets killing of Ellie Cornell's character Rachel because of the fans, well what about Laurie Strode, she was the first and main star besides Loomis in the series, and does he regret killing her off, No!  I know Jamie lee Curtis did not want to be in this film, and you know what I do not blame her one bit!  Look who she would have been acting with, BUSTA CRAP and TYRA BANKS.  But do something with the character some other way.  The series is now pointless, his whole family is dead, there is no more story to tell. Now this series is just going to turn into a Jason movie.  I like Jason Movies but I always thought Halloween had a better storyline than Friday the 13th.  Now its just going to be KILL KILL KILL anyone.  That is not How Michael Myers works, he does not kill for fun, he kills because he kills his family.  His family is dead.  So now we are stuck with idiots who have nothing to do with Michael.  That is why it should have ended with H20. This movie also makes H20 pointless.  The whole point was for Laurie Strode to get her revenge and win,  but this movie took all that away from it for the sake of money.  I am sorry for complaining so much, I am just really insulted that how this series is going to end up in the future.  I grew up watching these movies, and I know some of the sequals were bad, (PART 5 and 6) but at least those movies has characters attached to Myers.  This one has no one.  And if I get attacked for my review well so be it.  This is how my feelings feel and they are not going to change,  worst wishes to Halloween 9.

It starts off under this immediately interesting premise, with Damon's character progressively educating himself about his identity through the gradual realization of his own ignorance to the true reality of who he is. The more he learns, the more he realizes that he doesn't know, as the saying goes. And we are more than willing to tag along and make all of these thrilling discoveries with him.The movie has a remarkable amount of strong points, but almost as many weak points. It grows a little frustrating after a while as we learn how much Marie is willing to put up with in order to stay with this guy. It's kind of important that she's there because, as he said in the most amusing line in the film, she's the only person he knows. On the other hand, it's hard to imagine that someone as good-looking as Franka Potente has been having such a hard time finding a boyfriend that she is willing to go through the car chases and gunfights and explosions that are involved with her new friend, who hasn't told her his name because he didn't even know it himself. And why did he pay her $20,000 for the ride to Paris? Did that serve any purpose in the film other than illustrating the massive amount of money that he has at his disposal?  On the one hand, it's easy to see how weak the scriptwriting is when we consider the real logistics of Marie deciding to stay by Jason's side (if that IS his real name&#133;) through all of this mess, but on the other hand, we are willing to forgive things like that because the rest of the movie is so good. Some of the action scenes are a little extensive, but even most of those are forgivable. There is a scene, for example, where Bourne pushes a man's body off of a flight of stairs and over a drop of four or five stories, is able to concentrate enough to shoot a guy a couple of flights down, and then uses the body as a sort of cushion to break his fall. This is something that I've always wondered about (I can't remember why, but I've wondered why I haven't seen someone do this in an action movie before. Maybe now I know why). Now, if Bourne is capable of doing half the things that we've seen him do in this movie, I'm more than willing to believe that he could pull something like this off, although the landing didn't look real at all. Now all I need is to see more people simply shooting the guy who's holding a gun to a hostage's head, demanding escape. I'm sick and tired of seeing cops put their guns down and let the bad guy go instead of just shooting him in the head when they had him in their crosshairs. I saw Charlie Sheen do it in Navy Seals, I just wish more action films would catch on and quit with the weak scripts. Remember that scene in Snatch when Mickey O'Neil threw that first punch and knocked that huge guy out? Something similar happened in The Bourne identity when Bourne is sleeping on a bench in a snow-covered park and two police officers come to tell him to move along, and he ends up beating them both to the ground before he even really realizes what he's doing. This is what makes the movie fun. Sure, it's not the most intellectually involved screenplay, and it's even been done before in almost exactly the same form, but it's fun to go along with this character as he discovers all of these skills that he has, especially since he doesn't even know why he has them. (spoilers) There are times during the film when there are so many possible identities that may each be the real one (if there IS a real one) that it gets confusing as to which identity he is investigating or which one is thought dead by his enemies. However, whenever this does happen, it only serves to concentrate more attention on the action and the physical aspect of the film, which is clearly its strongest asset. We eventually learn that Jason Bourne is a $30 million government weapon, and if I remember correctly, there was nothing in the film to suggest for certain that Jason was not some sort of cyborg, including that first kiss scene. When Marie put that first peck on his lips, he stood there staring at her for a few moments too long, like he was consulting his memory banks trying to figure out how to react in this sort of situation. Besides, if he were a cyborg, it would explain his bulletproof shoulder blades!  Here's a guy that has survived floating for an unknown period of time unconscious in the ocean (okay, THAT hints that he's not a cyborg), two bullet wounds to the back that would have punctured both lungs and probably his heart if it weren't for the above-mentioned bulletproof shoulder blades, and who can pull all sorts of fight moves that make Neo and Morpheus look like kids, and we are taken along with him as he desperately tries to figure out who he is. It's not exactly clear who the bad guy(s) is or are in this film, which only serves to add to the suspense and fun created within it. It's an interesting and refreshing change to see the kind of character development that we see in this film, where we grow to like and to root for this guy with amnesia only to later learn that he was pretty much the mastermind of the botched assassination attempt. Given that, he can't really be seen as the good guy, but I guess that since he only wants to forget all that and start a new life with Marie we're meant to see him that way.And speaking of which, this is the first element of the film where it starts to falter. This guy is a trained government assassin, yet he is completely derailed by a couple of kids at the crucial point in his mission. Sure, it would not be a pleasant thing to see an African leader murdered in a film in front of his kids, but you have to wonder where that $30 million went if he is so easily weakened. But if you can look past the questionable female presence in the film (questionable only because no woman on earth would go through all this for a good looking guy) and the obligatory ending (I remember watching the conclusion of all of Bourne's troubles, and just waiting for the impending reunion scene), you will get a quality action film. There are some scenes where the movie knows it's messing up (such as when Bourne amazingly knows EXACLTY where the shotgun is in a house that he has only spent one night in), but it is always sure to correct itself sometime during the film (in this case, in the scene where he explains to Marie that he knows that the best place to find a gun right now is in the cab of the gray pick-up truck out front).  Of course, we can't understand how he could know this, but that's beside the point because we aren't meant to discover a full understanding of who he was before the assassination attempt. The Bourne Identity is not about who Jason Bourne was before he lost his memory, its about who he is as a human being underneath all of the training that he was given by the government and the purpose of which he no longer understands or believes in. He doesn't want to be an assassin, he wants a normal life with Marie. We're just here to see the conflict involved in getting rid of one life and starting the other. These are very different themes for one movie to deal with, which is why it falters at some points, but the action and the acting and sheer fast-paced excitement over-shadow the lesser elements, making The Bourne Identity a very worthy action thriller.

In his hip is found a device with an account number from a bank in Switzerland. The man is now on a search for his true identity and finds out more than he wanted to know. I found this movie to be just spectacular, I was upset when they finally made me leave the theatre, I wanted more. I'm a big fan of movies involving spies and intrigue, so when I saw the preview I had to check this one out. Before the movie started I was pleased to see a preview for Reign of Fire, which I plan to see this weekend, the preview was awesome and definitely prepared me for action, which I was wanting to see. In the back of my head I was doubting my reason for coming to see it, it is a movie with Matt Damon, who I only liked in Dogma. But my fear of it being something like a spy movie for teeny-boppers was extinguished. This movie was awesome, it was a film I could watch over and over again. The action was incredible, Matt Damon kicked ass and I don't even like him! The chase scene with the Mini-Coop was pretty inventive, I would have never thought one could race one. Doug Liman used his cast and his locations very well. He showed Paris as Paris, by not putting the Eifel Tower in every shot, actually, I barely remember it being in there at all. Matt Damon was perfect in this role, Franka Potente seemed a little static to me(but I'm used to seeing her in Run Lola Run), Chris Cooper was excellent as the villian, so to say, with his brass, American-style gung-ho attitude which made his performance memorable. The cameo of Julia Stiles though I really didn't enjoy, it was nice that she was in there, but her talents were not really used. I felt that they could have switched her and Franka Potente, now that would've probably worked. Overall, this film was worth it, I definitely classify it with my favourite film of this genre, The Day of the Jackal. Go see it if you, I was sure not disappointed, in fact I've recommended it to everyone I know.

So dark and so creepy, yet so cool and hip at the same time. Michael Mann is without a doubt, one of the finest directors ever. This would be the first of the three Thomas Harris stories dealing with Hannibal Lechter, although in this film, Lechter is more of a minor player. By the way, in this film Hannibal is played by Brian Cox and his performance is incredible. Cox is creepy and disturbing, the way he should be, instead of the over the top way he was played by Hopkins. The movie deals with FBI agent Will Graham, a retired FBI agent that in his prime, had the ability to get into the minds of serial killers and interpret why they did certain things. This helped him to catch the monsters and put them away. Sadly, living in the minds of monsters can have a very negative effect on your own life. Graham has trouble getting the images out of his head and he is forced into retirement.  However, there is a serial killer called the Tooth Fairy that is murdering entire families while they sleep and the FBI is stumped. Once again Graham is pressured into coming out of retirement and prompted to get back into the mind of this maniac destroying families. This film was made in the mid-1980's, while Mann was still very much involved in his TV show Miami Vice and you can see some (many) similarities. The music, dress and sets are very Art Deco. Sonny Crockett never makes an appearance, but you might expect to see him. I have always felt that this was arguably the best movie of the three books (it was the best book for sure). Silence.. was excellent as well (also a great book). However, Hannibal was one of the worst movies ever made (the book was rotten as well). Sadly, the studio decided to re-name the movie Manhunter instead of Red Dragon at the last minute, which commercially killed the film. Many Harris readers did not know that this movie was based on the book. However, Mann makes the most of it by directing a great film. I see now, that the studios are re-making this film with a big budget and cast. I don't think it necessary. They ought to re-make Hannibal. **** out of **** for Red Dragon, I mean Manhunter.
