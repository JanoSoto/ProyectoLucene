For that, we have TV shows, which are more apt for this kind of judging alone based on their lower budgets and overall format. No, a movie should be to a large extent judged on its ability to take your breath away, to leave you as a different person than you were before and make you feel like you've gone on an epic adventure. That is why many of my favorite films of all time are epics.That is why The Wizard of Oz is not on my top 100 movies of all time list and this is. Strangely enough, those two movies form a dichotomy. TWoZ, with its color and fantasy plot, was a harbinger of things to come. This film, which is openly a wistful remembrance of the Antebellum South, was a send-off to the past.Yes, one could consider this film problematic for reasons, particularly racial ones, that I have absolutely no desire to discuss in the content of this review. I will just say that if you are going through movies that are artistic pinnacles yet troublesome when viewed with modern glasses, you could do a lot worse. Check out The Birth of a Nation if you want to see why. Still, say what you want against this movie in that regard.But do concede that viewed from an artistic viewpoint, the viewpoint that I always prefer to talk about a movie from, it is a triumph. A sweaty, bloody, four hour, epic triumph. When I watch this, I feel like I have been given wings and a time machine and told to just go. There is a reason this film has not inspired as much as did The Wizard of Oz. Actually, there are... quite a few reasons for that. But I'm talking about the scale. It's the same reason there are far more Potter wannabes than true LOTR wannabes. Whatever reasons you state, they do make a difference. The Wizard of Oz inspired many light fantasies to come. This didn't directly inspire very many notable films at all (with the notable exception of Barry Lyndon, but i'll talk about that movies creepy similarities to this one when I discuss the former).Combine that with the fact that three-hour-plus epics are as rare as dinosaurs nowadays, and you get a movie that is unique, different, and separated from the culture in which we know live. This fascinates me. Around the two-hour mark, when Scarlet rides off from a burning city, I felt emotions few movies have made me feel. Inspiration via the stunningly shot landscape, the best of many beautiful ones in this movie. A true sense of scale; the movie is only half over, but I get a feeling that I've been through so much already. Change; the winds of such were certainly in this scene. Romantic. Depressing. Hopeful. And wholly cinematic. It is the kind of scene that doesn't exist in film any more. The closest that you get is a television special. And if you can't find the beauty in that, Well frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn. The characters are timeless. Clark Gable's Rhett Butler is suave and sophisticated yet fallible. I have seen many failed attempts to show a character like this, so it is refreshing to see it done right. It is like going to the mountains after driving through New Jersey. What so many movies get wrong about these kinds of characters is that they are not just striking and, for lack of a better term, cool. They are that way for a purpose. To use a common and only slightly disconnected example, people would not be such big Han Solo fans if Han was a construction man. Yes, that's more of an aesthetic analysis than a character one. But without aesthetic and presentation, there is nothing to wow our senses as our brain works through the plot of the film. And for this film, there is a lot of plot. What I love about these longer movies is that they don't end on the climax. Many moviegoers nowadays don't have the patience for this technique, but it's one of my favorites. If they made a four hour LOTR movie when it first came out, it would have had The Scouring of the Shire, one of my favorite chapters in it. But it is a good choice from a narrative standpoint as well. A story has five basic stages. Exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. Many tales forget the fourth in favor of a snappy resolution. But it is my personal favorite step, one I like to call 'The Hero Goes Home' step. Rarely has it worked as well as it does in Gone With the Wind. You feel the entire plot arc of the main character.Who the main character is deserves special mention in my eyes. It is Scarlett O'Hara, a young Southern belle who has to adapt to a changing social climate. Even these days, a protagonist in an epic drama who is a female is rare. Even these days, a protagonist in an epic drama who is a villain or anti-hero is rare. Yet this film, released in 1939, not a year known for its liberated climate, had both. I don't know whether to applaud this film or tear down so- called modern film for this. Maybe I should do both. It certainly makes for a more interesting story narratively speaking. Scarlett is, in my opinion, the most interesting of a posse of complex characters.So ends this review. I sincerely hope it did not take you as long to read as it did to watch this movie. Now go forth back into your lives. Because tomorrow is another day.

Early into the movie, it's evident that this film lacks the heart & soul of its predecessors and diverges a lot from the usual formula that had kept the fans around despite the poor sequels.Despite more budget, Rocky V fails to make proper use of it for the set pieces are similar to how they were in the first film, there is nothing to mention about its camera-work, Editing is disappointing for the entire 104 minutes of its runtime fails to offer anything interesting and for the most part, it's just plain boring cinema. Performances aren't worthy of mention at all for Stallone hams like crazy, so does the rest of the cast, the relationship between Balboa & his son is ineffectively handled, and the ending is just lame.On an overall scale, Rocky V is without a doubt the weakest instalment in the franchise and a sequel that shouldn't have been made in the first place. Stallone has gone on to discard it in the later years but his screenplay for that movie was just as bad. Although it's a shame that what was supposed to be the series finale didn't end the saga on a high note, it's also a relief considering that it made Stallone go back to the roots of the first picture and take ample time to draw out a fitting conclusion, which arrived 16 years later in the form of the much superior Rocky Balboa. Skip this one!

The screenplay isn't good at all for the plot wastes time on sequences that don't even play any relevant role in the final outcome, not much is added to reprising characters while the new ones are instantly forgettable.There isn't much to talk about its technical aspects for none of the elements have anything new to offer and while its reduced runtime is a welcome change, the final fight this film was building itself to ends up sooner than expected and on that scale, it's disappointing. As far as performances go, everyone fails to make their mark while Mr. T leaves no stone unturned to make his character one of the lamest ever to step into the ring.On an overall scale, Rocky III might be fun for those who had a good time with Rocky II but it marks a departure from what the first film was all about. There are a couple of interesting moments in the picture but most of it is forgettable. Stallone's input both in front & behind the camera continues its downfall, the dialogues are pretty much garbage, the finale fails to live up to its hype, and although Bill Conti's score feels repetitive, it's the only element that fares as per expectations.

In this film Sinbad (John Phillip Law) and crew mount a quest across the seas to solve the riddle of a map, accompanied by a slave girl with a strange eye tattoo on her palm (Caroline Munro), a masked Vizier (Douglas Wilmer) and a humorous green recruit (Kurt Christian). Meanwhile the evil sorcerer Koura is on their trail (Tom Baker).Sinbad adventures play like a Middle Eastern version of Conan the Barbarian, albeit with a slightly funner edge and a less dour protagonist. So, if you love Conan you'll likely appreciate all three of these Sinbad films. And even though I describe these movies as having a fun edge, they're not goofy. They're serious sword & sorcery movies; the protagonists just exude the joy and vitality of living.The items I demand in a Sinbad adventure are obvious A good casting choice for Sinbad, a great adventure story, exotic locations, a colorful assortment of likable characters & love-to-hate villains, beautiful women, and quality F\/X work (for the era). The Golden Voyage delivers in most of these areas, although the production values seem kinda cheap here and there. While John Phillip Law fits the Arabic role of Sinbad better than Kerwin Mathews, Patrick Wayne is even better in the sequel. Caroline is easily the most beautiful woman to appear in all three films despite the stiff competition from the likes of Kathryn Grant, Jane Seymour and Taryn Power.The score is fitting, the F\/X work is entertaining in a nostalgic way, and the Spanish locations are good, what we see of them anyway. This brings up the film's biggest weakness (to me anyway) It's too set-bound with most of the sets being the bowels of ancient temples or caverns. I can handle this because it's just one film in a trilogy, but the enclosed\/underground sets take away from the sea-going high adventure one expects with Sinbad. Furthermore, like I said, the production values are easily the least of the three. However, the movie makes up for it with perhaps the most colorful cast of characters, including the green-skinned tribe.All three Sinbad movies are very different since each has a different person in the title role, not to mention the rest of the characters.

If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.In only a span of six years, John Hughes managed to direct some of the best comedies from the 80's which surprisingly hold up very well to this day. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is still regarded as a classic in the genre and despite being a simple mainstream movie, Matthew Broderick delivers such an iconic performance that many teens continue to fall in love with his character as the decades pass. The gags are handled with perfect comedic timing and the soundtrack has become such a recognizable tune in pop culture. I don't know exactly what it is that has made this such a beloved film amongst American teenagers, but it seems to transcend generations over time because of its accessibility. It's a light comedy about being young and mischievous that simply seems to delight and captivate audiences who are looking for some form of escape. It's rare for a film with a simple premise like this to continue captivating audiences over time and even those teens who watched it in the 80's and are now mature decide to go back and revisit it for nostalgic purposes or to introduce it to their now teenage sons. This is just further proof that no one had the comedic touch that Hughes had in the 80's with his teenage comedies. I still prefer Planes, Trains, and Automobiles as his go to movie, but Ferris Bueller was a delightful experience. I look forward to catching up with some more of his classic films. I remember having seen classic scenes of this movie, but this was my first time watching it from beginning to end and I was delighted and surprised because I didn't think I would ever like Broderick as much as I did here. This is by far his best performance.The film takes place in Chicago where we are introduced to Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick), a senior in High School who has decided to take the day off from school by fooling his parents into thinking he's sick. Ferris constantly breaks the fourth wall and speaks to the audience letting them know what he's thinking. His plan is so well thought out that even his friends at school think he's developed a serious condition and are trying to raise money for his treatment. He's the sort of guy that everyone in school dreams of being and his life motto is simply to enjoy life to the fullest. He personifies the spirit of youth and that is what makes him such a likable guy despite acting irresponsable at times. The only people who don't believe him are his sister, Jeanie (Jennifer Grey), who is angry everyone keeps on falling for his lame excuses, and the school principal Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) who is determined to discover his lie and make him lose the school year for it. Ferris has everything planned out very carefully and is convinced his plan will work. He calls his best friend, Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), who has also taken a sick leave, but in his case he's really feeling bad. Ferris convinces him to come pick him up and together they come up with a plan to help Ferris's girlfriend, Sloane (Mia Sara), get out of classes. In a hilarious scene the duo call Principal Rooney impersonating Sloane's father and asking him to give his daughter permission to leave the school because her grandmother has passed away. Ferris then convinces Cameron to take his father's Ferrari and the adventure begins for the three friends through the streets of Chicago. Hughes has always excelled as a screenwriter and he is responsible for some of the funniest comedies from the 80's and 90's. He didn't direct as many films, but he has been involved with many scripts. In Ferris Bueller he seems to have written a simple but perfectly executed script of a young teenager who is trying to live life to the fullest. He could've come out as cocky, but there is some heart to his character and it becomes incredibly hard not to root for him, especially when Hughes put so much emphasis during the opening scene portraying the dullness of High School life and then introducing Principal Rooney as such a douchebag. The scenes where he is desperately trying to uncover Ferris's plan are incredibly cartoonish and over the top, but it is funny nonetheless. There are also a few heart felt scenes between Ferris and Cameron which make his character even more likable despite his bad influence. Broderick delivers the performance of his career and there are very few actors who can break the fourth wall the way he did here without interrupting the flow of the story (the other who comes to mind is John Cusack). There is also a great scene in which Ferris covers one of The Beatle's song in a parade that simply adds to the already amazing soundtrack. Jones is hilarious as Rooney and it's not often that these over the top villains are portrayed well. He never comes off annoying, and that's something difficult to achieve. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a comedy that has transcended time and generations and it may come as a surprise to many considering it's such a light and simple premise, but Hughes manages to work his magic. http\/\/estebueno10.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"24 September 2015","score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Life moves pretty fast.

It's rare for a film with a simple premise like this to continue captivating audiences over time and even those teens who watched it in the 80's and are now mature decide to go back and revisit it for nostalgic purposes or to introduce it to their now teenage sons. This is just further proof that no one had the comedic touch that Hughes had in the 80's with his teenage comedies. I still prefer Planes, Trains, and Automobiles as his go to movie, but Ferris Bueller was a delightful experience. I look forward to catching up with some more of his classic films. I remember having seen classic scenes of this movie, but this was my first time watching it from beginning to end and I was delighted and surprised because I didn't think I would ever like Broderick as much as I did here. This is by far his best performance.The film takes place in Chicago where we are introduced to Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick), a senior in High School who has decided to take the day off from school by fooling his parents into thinking he's sick. Ferris constantly breaks the fourth wall and speaks to the audience letting them know what he's thinking. His plan is so well thought out that even his friends at school think he's developed a serious condition and are trying to raise money for his treatment. He's the sort of guy that everyone in school dreams of being and his life motto is simply to enjoy life to the fullest. He personifies the spirit of youth and that is what makes him such a likable guy despite acting irresponsable at times. The only people who don't believe him are his sister, Jeanie (Jennifer Grey), who is angry everyone keeps on falling for his lame excuses, and the school principal Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) who is determined to discover his lie and make him lose the school year for it. Ferris has everything planned out very carefully and is convinced his plan will work. He calls his best friend, Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), who has also taken a sick leave, but in his case he's really feeling bad. Ferris convinces him to come pick him up and together they come up with a plan to help Ferris's girlfriend, Sloane (Mia Sara), get out of classes. In a hilarious scene the duo call Principal Rooney impersonating Sloane's father and asking him to give his daughter permission to leave the school because her grandmother has passed away. Ferris then convinces Cameron to take his father's Ferrari and the adventure begins for the three friends through the streets of Chicago. Hughes has always excelled as a screenwriter and he is responsible for some of the funniest comedies from the 80's and 90's. He didn't direct as many films, but he has been involved with many scripts. In Ferris Bueller he seems to have written a simple but perfectly executed script of a young teenager who is trying to live life to the fullest. He could've come out as cocky, but there is some heart to his character and it becomes incredibly hard not to root for him, especially when Hughes put so much emphasis during the opening scene portraying the dullness of High School life and then introducing Principal Rooney as such a douchebag. The scenes where he is desperately trying to uncover Ferris's plan are incredibly cartoonish and over the top, but it is funny nonetheless. There are also a few heart felt scenes between Ferris and Cameron which make his character even more likable despite his bad influence. Broderick delivers the performance of his career and there are very few actors who can break the fourth wall the way he did here without interrupting the flow of the story (the other who comes to mind is John Cusack). There is also a great scene in which Ferris covers one of The Beatle's song in a parade that simply adds to the already amazing soundtrack. Jones is hilarious as Rooney and it's not often that these over the top villains are portrayed well. He never comes off annoying, and that's something difficult to achieve. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is a comedy that has transcended time and generations and it may come as a surprise to many considering it's such a light and simple premise, but Hughes manages to work his magic. http\/\/estebueno10.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"24 September 2015","score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.In only a span of six years, John Hughes managed to direct some of the best comedies from the 80's which surprisingly hold up very well to this day. Ferris Bueller's Day Off is still regarded as a classic in the genre and despite being a simple mainstream movie, Matthew Broderick delivers such an iconic performance that many teens continue to fall in love with his character as the decades pass. The gags are handled with perfect comedic timing and the soundtrack has become such a recognizable tune in pop culture.

The shortcomings that were evident in the direction & writing aspects of Rocky II & Rocky III continue here as well, the action segments range from impressive to absurd, and the drama is once again a weak element.The technical aspects are more refined, Bill Conti's absence from the music department is felt at times, and watching Apollo Creed getting beaten to a pulp after such an exaggerated entrance of his is no doubt hilarious as hell. The reprising cast has been in stealth mode since the first movie and nothing much changes here. Dolph Lundgren however does well with what he's given and makes his character of Ivan Drago truly frightening to an extent.On an overall scale, Rocky IV is definitely more enjoyable, entertaining & rewarding than the previous two entries and the final fight also manages to live up to its hype to finish the story on a rousing high but the inconsistency in its storytelling department and shallow work from its cast never really allow this sequel to lift from the ground and even with more budget & bigger ambitions, it fails to emulate the overall success of the original.

It's an instant classic which everyone should watch and enjoy.

From the seemingly cliché lifestyle Truman lives, with friendly neighbors, a steady job, and even the typical adult look with his suit and briefcase, Truman lives the life that the average American in the 80s would want to have, and there is nothing wrong with his life at all. But is his life really perfect? Since meeting his first love, nothing in his life has seemed to be quite the same, and he wants to know why. This movie is a perfectly executed film about how the perfect life is unachievable, but his life may not be as great as everyone seems to think.The film was very well done. A few of the things that the movie did well were the way that it gave the main character, Truman, personality with almost everything he did, whether it be his personality quirks or the very catchy things he says, almost every part of Truman is extremely memorable. All of the characters meshed well, and had very good acting to go along with it. Despite being a funny twist on a problem that society faces, being the media and the issues with it, you do not really find yourself laughing at this movie. It takes a tone that really drags you into the thought processes and feelings of Truman using dark humor which is hard to catch onto. Going with the actual movie and its plot, many small things fit the movie perfectly to add to the overall experience, such as the soundtrack, and make the movie really great. The greatest part of the film is one that you will really feel upon seeing it, and it is the ending (no spoilers). It was perfectly executed and left a huge lasting impression on me after seeing the film, wishing that the movie was not yet over. Overall, the movie was well done, with a genius way of presenting a satire. If you would like a great movie that will require some thinking to really get involved in, this is the movie for you.

Everyone says it's one of the best coming-of-age comedies out there, and it's maintained that title for nearly 3 decades now. The movie starts off very promising, immediately setting itself apart from a sea of derivative titles in the coming-of-age comedy genre, with its rather original protagonist. Most conventional high school films are about an unpopular kid's rise to popularity despite numerous challenges, popular kids bullying and rejecting them, etc. Ferris Bueller, on the other hand, is already popular. He's handsome. He's got a girlfriend. All the things that the protagonist has at the end of most high school movies, Ferris Bueller starts his day off with. However, I now understand why kids like him are usually the villain, because Ferris Bueller is just an unbelievable asshole. He fakes sickness to get out of school, something we've all done and can relate to, but then he drags his actually sick friend, Cameron, out of bed using all kinds of manipulation, not because he enjoys hanging out with him, but because he needs a ride. He then pressures Cameron to steal his dad's Ferrari, drives to school with the henceforth stressed-out Cameron to pick up his girlfriend, effectively turning him into the third wheel for the remainder of the day. In fact, they barely talk to the guy from that point. Oh, and he doesn't return the car after all this, instead he drives recklessly for a while, to yet further worried protest from Cameron that goes ignored, then takes it to a garage and hands the keys to a random guy (who also proceeds to drive recklessly with it). He then spends the rest of day doing the weirdest crap. He could drive around in the Ferrari for example, or go do drugs or smoke or drink like normal kids do when they skip school, or maybe use his popularity and his confidence to get Cameron a girl as well, but instead he uses his day off to dine at a fancy restaurant and go to a museum. What high school kid ditches school to go to museum? Oh, and apparently he is so popular, that he can use his citywide influence to be the star of a whole parade. I'm all for the anti-hero approach to the otherwise over-told high school story, but Ferris Bueller is not a good anti-hero. You can't relate to him and you don't root for him, except only when the school principal develops a strange obsession with exposing Ferris Bueller's whole plan, and only then because the principal is an even bigger asshole. The story is mostly not so believable, and none of the characters are very layered or developed. From the weirdly adult choice of entertainment, to the variety of strange and hardly believable events that unfold, such as the principal's obsession, or Cameron entering a catatonic state at some point, to the parade scene, the film feels like a collection of random events sparsely unfolding between a lot of silence or uninteresting\/unfunny dialog. A big portion of the film is just kinda awkward. In my opinion, what makes most teenage movies great, is how relatable they are to all of us, and to our own adolescent experiences. As teenagers they helped us get through our own lives and as adults they make us laugh at who we used to be. In my opinion, Ferris Bueller's Day Off fails in this regard. Maybe if I was myself still a teenager, or kind of an asshole, I would appreciate this film more. To its credit it doesn't look like it's a movie that hasn't aged well, though that would at least explain why such a bad movie is so highly spoken of.

One of my favorites is when the title character, played by Julia Roberts, complains she isn't taken seriously because she didn't go to law school.Law school! moans her boss, Ed Masry (Albert Finney). At this point, I'd settle for charm school.Never mind Masry Erin Brockovich, at least the movie, has charm coming out of its ears. From Erin's many abrasive wisecracks to her more sensitive dealings with the good people of Hinkley, California, this is a high-impact touchy-feely drama that works familiar territory in unusual ways, making for engaging entertainment.Girl-power enthusiasts will enjoy how Roberts inhabits her role with surprising gusto and some jaw-dropping language, coming off a bit like George C. Scott did in Patton, albeit with a much different wardrobe.The contributions of two women behind the scenes are equally worthy of note Screenwriter Susannah Grant and editor Anne V. Coates. Grant capably juggles her two key themes, of corporate malfeasance and personal self-discovery by binding them with a common thread of motherhood. There are cute moments and heartbreaking moments; the strength of Grant's writing is they all feel like authentic moments on screen.Coates, who edited Lawrence Of Arabia, keeps the story moving with sharp cuts that invest you in drama without bogging you down in details. Right after Erin first meets Masry, to tell him about her hit-and-run case, we cut to her telling her story in a courtroom (only one of two courtroom scenes in the whole film, both brief.) The whole film moves like that, not rat-a-tat, but alert to keeping scenes tight where they can be, without shortchanging the emotional arc.As far as guys go, Finney is enjoyably easy-going, quite a departure from his Angry Young Man persona of the 1960s sporting a doughy Texas accent. He's consistently likable as Erin's constructive- minded foil. Aaron Eckhart is also effective playing a character far removed from his usual sinister-smoothy roles. And Erin Brockovich contains probably the most clever use of character actor Tracey Walter you'll ever see, a tribute to both his acting skill and Coates' cuts.Steven Soderbergh may be the most consequential director of the 21st century so far, for the way his films manage to both engage and challenge audiences. Here, the emphasis is more on the former. Still, his use of hand-held cameras for small, intimate scenes, and his refusal to overplay the heavy drama represent significant departures from the usual Hollywood treatments.Brockovich doesn't make for much of a final statement. It shortchanges the emotional issues it raises, content instead to tout a historic cash settlement that can't help but land a bit flat. The real Brockovich, like Patton, may not live up to the great build-up she gets here. But for at least two hours, Roberts, Soderbergh, and company are too good for you to care about that.

One of my favorites is when the title character, played by Julia Roberts, complains she isn't taken seriously because she didn't go to law school.Law school! moans her boss, Ed Masry (Albert Finney). At this point, I'd settle for charm school.Never mind Masry Erin Brockovich, at least the movie, has charm coming out of its ears. From Erin's many abrasive wisecracks to her more sensitive dealings with the good people of Hinkley, California, this is a high-impact touchy-feely drama that works familiar territory in unusual ways, making for engaging entertainment.Girl-power enthusiasts will enjoy how Roberts inhabits her role with surprising gusto and some jaw-dropping language, coming off a bit like George C. Scott did in Patton, albeit with a much different wardrobe.The contributions of two women behind the scenes are equally worthy of note Screenwriter Susannah Grant and editor Anne V. Coates. Grant capably juggles her two key themes, of corporate malfeasance and personal self-discovery by binding them with a common thread of motherhood. There are cute moments and heartbreaking moments; the strength of Grant's writing is they all feel like authentic moments on screen.Coates, who edited Lawrence Of Arabia, keeps the story moving with sharp cuts that invest you in drama without bogging you down in details. Right after Erin first meets Masry, to tell him about her hit-and-run case, we cut to her telling her story in a courtroom (only one of two courtroom scenes in the whole film, both brief.) The whole film moves like that, not rat-a-tat, but alert to keeping scenes tight where they can be, without shortchanging the emotional arc.As far as guys go, Finney is enjoyably easy-going, quite a departure from his Angry Young Man persona of the 1960s sporting a doughy Texas accent. He's consistently likable as Erin's constructive- minded foil. Aaron Eckhart is also effective playing a character far removed from his usual sinister-smoothy roles. And Erin Brockovich contains probably the most clever use of character actor Tracey Walter you'll ever see, a tribute to both his acting skill and Coates' cuts.Steven Soderbergh may be the most consequential director of the 21st century so far, for the way his films manage to both engage and challenge audiences. Here, the emphasis is more on the former. Still, his use of hand-held cameras for small, intimate scenes, and his refusal to overplay the heavy drama represent significant departures from the usual Hollywood treatments.Brockovich doesn't make for much of a final statement. It shortchanges the emotional issues it raises, content instead to tout a historic cash settlement that can't help but land a bit flat. The real Brockovich, like Patton, may not live up to the great build-up she gets here. But for at least two hours, Roberts, Soderbergh, and company are too good for you to care about that.
