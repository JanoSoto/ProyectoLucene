They tend to be feel good, gooey, sentimental ventures, and the cynical modern man might want to look down on all that. But then... It's Christmas, darn it, happy happy joy joy is what it's all about. And then again, there's the occasional Yuletide tale like Dr Seuss' classic Grinch book which cheers you up while remaining a bit edgy. After all, it does revolve around a character who DOESN'T like Christmas, and who takes it upon himself to steal it away from the Whos of Whoville. Of course, as we all know, the Grinch will end up realizing that the holiday spirit isn't something you buy in a store and his heart will grow three sizes, but before that he does get to instigate mucho mayhem and revel in his own evilness, and that's gotta be cool... Especially when the Grinch is portrayed by Jim Carrey in a manic (even by Carrey standards) performance!But then again, what was a perfect story for a little book with lots of pictures or a 22 minute animated TV special can't possibly sustain a feature length picture. Hence, director Ron Howard had to bring a lot of new stuff in, and for the most part, he succeeded beautifully. What he did was spend a lot more time with the Whos. In Dr Seuss' book just a bunch of odd looking people who dig Christmas, but in Howard's version, they're regular people who just happen to have snouts and live in a gorgeously designed, Tim Burton meets Candyland style town in a snowflake. They can be mean and selfish sometimes, they cheat on their wives, they are careless... And when Christmas time comes, they get lost in the stockings and ribbons and presents and decorations and shopping madness, and sorta forget what it's all about. Something little Cindy Lou Who is aware of, and she wants to do something about it. The way she sees it, how good can Christmas be if there's a Grinch left out in his mountainside lair? She feels that in the spirit of the season, the Whos should try to include him.But who is the Grinch anyway? Here's the other place where Howard expiates the source material, by giving the Grinch a back story. Not only was he born with a heart two sizes too small and green fur all over, but it turns out that he got picked on in grade school, that he had a crush on a classmate but only made a fool of himself and chose to leave the world behind and go immerse himself in resentment and self-loathing in the town dump. Mmm, I know, it's a bit annoying how there's always got to be a damn Freudian motivation to everything, like oh, the Grinch was humiliated on Christmas as a kid, so now he hates the whole thing, and he's even gonna steal it! As for the stuff with the Whos, it sometimes feels like just what it is, filling, but then again, how can you complain when the movie is such a marvel to be seen! I often found myself in awe before the wonderful images Howard shows us. Whoville, with the endless holiday decorations, the cute little pastel houses, the countless lights, the bright colors, the snow... Then the Whos themselves, who are very peculiar and colorful in their own right, with the bizarre make up job that gives them snouts and big teeth.Last but not least is Jim Carrey's Grinch, who lights up the movie every time he's on screen. Sure, there's the brilliant make-up job done by Rick Baker, hiding Carrey under all that green fur, a doggish face and yellow eyes, but what's really surprising is that Carrey still comes through, as if he truly morphed into the Grinch's skin. He remains exceptionally expressive and natural, and Carrey is free to chew up a whole damn lot of scenery and be gleefully mean, playful and sarcastic. For a harmless little family film, the movie can be quite offbeat and laugh-out-loud hilarious, especially in the scenes where the Grinch is by himself in his cave being self-conscious about his state of reclusion, arguing with his echo and going around hating intensely the Whos, alphabetically! If only for Carrey's hyperactive, larger than life performance, this How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a must see, but even beyond that, it's a fine Christmas film that will delight kids and grown-ups alike.

After all, it does revolve around a character who DOESN'T like Christmas, and who takes it upon himself to steal it away from the Whos of Whoville. Of course, as we all know, the Grinch will end up realizing that the holiday spirit isn't something you buy in a store and his heart will grow three sizes, but before that he does get to instigate mucho mayhem and revel in his own evilness, and that's gotta be cool... Especially when the Grinch is portrayed by Jim Carrey in a manic (even by Carrey standards) performance!But then again, what was a perfect story for a little book with lots of pictures or a 22 minute animated TV special can't possibly sustain a feature length picture. Hence, director Ron Howard had to bring a lot of new stuff in, and for the most part, he succeeded beautifully. What he did was spend a lot more time with the Whos. In Dr Seuss' book just a bunch of odd looking people who dig Christmas, but in Howard's version, they're regular people who just happen to have snouts and live in a gorgeously designed, Tim Burton meets Candyland style town in a snowflake. They can be mean and selfish sometimes, they cheat on their wives, they are careless... And when Christmas time comes, they get lost in the stockings and ribbons and presents and decorations and shopping madness, and sorta forget what it's all about. Something little Cindy Lou Who is aware of, and she wants to do something about it. The way she sees it, how good can Christmas be if there's a Grinch left out in his mountainside lair? She feels that in the spirit of the season, the Whos should try to include him.But who is the Grinch anyway? Here's the other place where Howard expiates the source material, by giving the Grinch a back story. Not only was he born with a heart two sizes too small and green fur all over, but it turns out that he got picked on in grade school, that he had a crush on a classmate but only made a fool of himself and chose to leave the world behind and go immerse himself in resentment and self-loathing in the town dump. Mmm, I know, it's a bit annoying how there's always got to be a damn Freudian motivation to everything, like oh, the Grinch was humiliated on Christmas as a kid, so now he hates the whole thing, and he's even gonna steal it! As for the stuff with the Whos, it sometimes feels like just what it is, filling, but then again, how can you complain when the movie is such a marvel to be seen! I often found myself in awe before the wonderful images Howard shows us. Whoville, with the endless holiday decorations, the cute little pastel houses, the countless lights, the bright colors, the snow... Then the Whos themselves, who are very peculiar and colorful in their own right, with the bizarre make up job that gives them snouts and big teeth.Last but not least is Jim Carrey's Grinch, who lights up the movie every time he's on screen. Sure, there's the brilliant make-up job done by Rick Baker, hiding Carrey under all that green fur, a doggish face and yellow eyes, but what's really surprising is that Carrey still comes through, as if he truly morphed into the Grinch's skin. He remains exceptionally expressive and natural, and Carrey is free to chew up a whole damn lot of scenery and be gleefully mean, playful and sarcastic. For a harmless little family film, the movie can be quite offbeat and laugh-out-loud hilarious, especially in the scenes where the Grinch is by himself in his cave being self-conscious about his state of reclusion, arguing with his echo and going around hating intensely the Whos, alphabetically! If only for Carrey's hyperactive, larger than life performance, this How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a must see, but even beyond that, it's a fine Christmas film that will delight kids and grown-ups alike.

I believe there were six other people in the entire theater that Saturday night. This is not a good sign for a movie on its opening weekend. Original Sin stars the aforementioned Mrs. Billy Bob Thornton, and Antonio Banderas. Who, I have concluded is perhaps one of the luckiest actors in film today, he has romped about with Salma Hayek, (in Desperado) and now Angelina Jolie.

Shortly thereafter Luis begins noticing inconsistencies in what he knows of her from her letters, and her actions. Is this really Julia? Things begin to get stranger when Julia refuses to write to her sister back in the states. Julia's love for the theater is immediately apparent, and so might be some telling signs of infidelity. Luis great sex is about to end when a man claiming to be a private investigator shows up and wants to see Julia. Mr. Private Investigator, Billy, is an evil man, and I cheered for his death. Luis, blinded by the great sex, (as we men are prone to) stupidly goes and puts Julia's name on all his bank accounts. Julia disappears, leaving Luis with about $65. Gee, Didn't see that coming did you?  Luis decides he is going to devote himself to hunting her down and killing her, then the story takes some interesting twists and turns, and we find out that Julia isn't really the bad girl at all, she's totally controlled by someone else. We feel for Jolie's character, that's for sure.Luis genuinely loves Julia, and it would seem that the controlled Julia honestly has fallen in love with Luis. So, how can they be together when Julia is ordered to kill Luis? You'll have to see the movie to find out, I won't give it all away.Instead, I shall discuss the scenes.  The scenery, the story set in Cuba has great sets, there are numerous elaborate looking houses, all set to a period long ago. The place sure looks like it would be nice. Of course, it's only in the movies.SEX!  Umm, the sex scenes I mean.  OK, so we get to see Angelina's Boobs, they aren't all bouncing all over the place, instead we get some tastefully done love scenes between her and Antonio. Guys will have to endure seeing Antonio's butt in order to see Angelina's boobs, not a bad trade off. But, this wasn't a film which left me needing to go home and change my underwear.  The number of nudey scenes aren't even that many, and this isn't terribly disappointing. I had expected some big time erotic thriller story, but instead, was left with more of a love story with some sex and killings thrown in. How about that acting?  Seemed awful good to me. What I did find nice was how this film is narrated at points by Angelina's character while she is telling a priest her story as she waits to be executed in Jail. You are left to wonder throughout most of the film, OK, what did she do? Who does she kill? How did she get caught? It is my opinion that the narration and the incarceration helped the film, rather than took away from it. It kept the audience with questions.Most of these things will be answered. We don't know exactly why she is thrown in jail to be executed, but it could be one of a few things. We also must assume she is caught when trying to save the one she loves. Finally putting her love of someone above what she has been forced to do for so long, and her own self preservation. Antonio plays the left behind lover filled with rage very well, and we see the internal strife he must combat when he finally catches up with Julia, does he love her enough to not kill her? Of course. Does he want her back? Of course. Shortly after catching up with her, there is a GREAT scene where he answers the door. Well worth not spoiling it by giving it away.The Private Investigator or Billy  He is convincing to Luis as someone who is there to help him, but really has ulterior motives. He is evil, he needs to die, and needs to die a slow painful death. See, he had that kind of effect on me, therefore, his performance was very well done. God, I really love Angelina Jolie's lips, don't you think she can do a real good you know what? I'm sure she swallow everything.The implied gang rape.  Sure, it isn't shown, and that's a good thing. But I abhor rape, and found it not necessary to the story in the least bit. The Cutting.  Julia\/Bonnie has some scars on her back. We even see another line added to her four scars, but we don't really know what the point of them is. If it is a way of keeping track of how many men she's seduced and stolen their money, it sure seems stupid. Finally.....

Luis great sex is about to end when a man claiming to be a private investigator shows up and wants to see Julia. Mr. Private Investigator, Billy, is an evil man, and I cheered for his death. Luis, blinded by the great sex, (as we men are prone to) stupidly goes and puts Julia's name on all his bank accounts. Julia disappears, leaving Luis with about $65. Gee, Didn't see that coming did you?  Luis decides he is going to devote himself to hunting her down and killing her, then the story takes some interesting twists and turns, and we find out that Julia isn't really the bad girl at all, she's totally controlled by someone else. We feel for Jolie's character, that's for sure.Luis genuinely loves Julia, and it would seem that the controlled Julia honestly has fallen in love with Luis. So, how can they be together when Julia is ordered to kill Luis? You'll have to see the movie to find out, I won't give it all away.Instead, I shall discuss the scenes.  The scenery, the story set in Cuba has great sets, there are numerous elaborate looking houses, all set to a period long ago. The place sure looks like it would be nice. Of course, it's only in the movies.SEX!  Umm, the sex scenes I mean.  OK, so we get to see Angelina's Boobs, they aren't all bouncing all over the place, instead we get some tastefully done love scenes between her and Antonio. Guys will have to endure seeing Antonio's butt in order to see Angelina's boobs, not a bad trade off. But, this wasn't a film which left me needing to go home and change my underwear.  The number of nudey scenes aren't even that many, and this isn't terribly disappointing. I had expected some big time erotic thriller story, but instead, was left with more of a love story with some sex and killings thrown in. How about that acting?  Seemed awful good to me. What I did find nice was how this film is narrated at points by Angelina's character while she is telling a priest her story as she waits to be executed in Jail. You are left to wonder throughout most of the film, OK, what did she do? Who does she kill? How did she get caught? It is my opinion that the narration and the incarceration helped the film, rather than took away from it. It kept the audience with questions.Most of these things will be answered. We don't know exactly why she is thrown in jail to be executed, but it could be one of a few things. We also must assume she is caught when trying to save the one she loves. Finally putting her love of someone above what she has been forced to do for so long, and her own self preservation. Antonio plays the left behind lover filled with rage very well, and we see the internal strife he must combat when he finally catches up with Julia, does he love her enough to not kill her? Of course. Does he want her back? Of course. Shortly after catching up with her, there is a GREAT scene where he answers the door. Well worth not spoiling it by giving it away.The Private Investigator or Billy  He is convincing to Luis as someone who is there to help him, but really has ulterior motives. He is evil, he needs to die, and needs to die a slow painful death. See, he had that kind of effect on me, therefore, his performance was very well done. God, I really love Angelina Jolie's lips, don't you think she can do a real good you know what? I'm sure she swallow everything.The implied gang rape.  Sure, it isn't shown, and that's a good thing. But I abhor rape, and found it not necessary to the story in the least bit. The Cutting.  Julia\/Bonnie has some scars on her back. We even see another line added to her four scars, but we don't really know what the point of them is. If it is a way of keeping track of how many men she's seduced and stolen their money, it sure seems stupid. Finally.....  I would say that Original Sin will come and go from the theater in another week or so do to terrible marketing, and judging by the size of the audience, terrible ticket sales. This is to bad, Original Sin is a decent film which would better fit in the winter film line up.Oh, and one more thing.  It is just amusing to hear how often who-res are brought up in the film. Someone even tells Luis to just go get a good who-re and everything will be better.

I've never heard of them before, and I hope to never hear of them again.This was the perfect opportunity to showcase one of the several worlds in the game's franchise Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, Dragonlance, Ravenloft, even Birthright.

Yes, there are dungeons, and there are dragons, and even a passing nod to the infamous beholder, the eye-stalked creature CGIs that are briefly seen from a distance.

If I were in your place, I would be ashamed.No stars from me.
