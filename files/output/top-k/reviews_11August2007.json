[{"date":"11 August 2007","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Near the beginning of the film, the protagonist, played brilliantly by Jeff Bridges, while teaching a class on terrorism, focuses on a bombing of a federal building in St Louis and someone accused of being the bomber. (Both are of course fictional, but no doubt inspired by the Oaklahoma City bombing of 1995). Bridges points out during his lecture that all terrorist atrocities of this nature need a scape-goat, whether they be innocent or guilty. He further asserts that sometimes the truth is sacrificed in order to provide the public with its sacrificial villain brought to justice in order that the illusion of comfort and stability be returned to the public. But Bridges hypothesizes that the criminal may be the wrong man and infers that he was brought to justice on false pretenses and from public pressure to find quickly the man responsible. It is easier to point the finger at one man and use slight discrepancies in character to fuel a caricatured image largely created by the media than to look at a larger more complex picture that might involve more individuals.This idea permeates the entire film of Arlington Road, and it even becomes the rhetoric of the ending in an unexpected way. Briefly, the story revolves around two dads, Bridges and Tim Robbins, whose lives intersect through a happenstance coincidence in which Bridges saves Robbins' son who was involved in a freak accident involving fireworks. The two become friends, and so do their sons. Even Bridge's girlfriend and Robbins' wife become close as well. As a kind of backdrop to the entire story, we learn that Bridges is a widower and his wife was an FBI agent killed in a mistaken raid on a reclusive family in the backwoods of Virginia. His girlfriend is one of his former students.As he becomes closer to the Robbins, Bridges notices that some of Robbins' information about his life and work do not add up. Robbins claims he is an architect working on a shopping mall, but notices that the blueprints represent an office building, not a multi-story office complex. He also appears to have lied about attending a particular college. Bridges digs deeper into the secrets of Robbins' past and becomes terrified by what he finds. Robbins begins seeming like an incarnation of the kinds of terrorists he studies and presents to his classes.The pacing of Robbins' investigation, and the entire film, is brilliant, with almost every scene entirely from Bridges' point of view. Simultaneously, Bridges' findings gradually unravel at a pace that fits with the character and situation. The acting is superb with a first-rate cast, with Robbins in particular perfectly suited as the emotionless yet banal-seeming neighbor who appears to be hiding something beneath his phony smile and diabolical eyes. Even Joan Cusack does a fine job as Robbins' wife where at first we believe she appears innocent.... The climax and the ending are unexpected but fit the rhetoric of the entire film as first proposed by the terrorism lecture. You'll have to see it from beginning to end to understand it.This is an uncommonly deep action movie with a lot of plot, character, theme and story that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Occasionally the sudden appearance of a particular character was enough to make me jump. I would go further but I don't want to spoil it for you. This film makes the later Die Hard and Lethal Weapon movies appear tame.

Jump forward to near the end of the Civil War & Bill dies, his gang is the last to accept amnesty from the Union to stop their fighting. The gang, but not Josey, decide to accept the Union's most generous offer but the Union think they are better off dead & shoot them all despite Josey Wales best attempt to save them. The Union send Captain Terrill (Bill McKinney) & ex outlaw Fletcher (John Vernon) to find & kill Josey as well as putting a large reward on his head which means his journey to Mexico becomes a perilous one...Staring & directed by Clint Eastwood who replaced Philip Kaufman as director which was a controversial move & prompted the DGA to rule that no current cast or crew could replace a director on a film & has since been known as the 'Eastwood Rule', anyway The Outlaw Josey Wales is considered to be a classic amongst many but that's not a feeling which I share as I thought it was a touch dull. The script by Philip Kaufman & Sonia Chernus was based on the novel 'Gone to Texas' by Forrest Carter & is as much a drama as a traditional Western which is fine if you like watching films that last for well over two hours where not that much actually happens, to me it just felt like Wales on horse back riding from one situation to another without much purpose to it. I couldn't really get into it, I didn't like the character's that much, I didn't think the story was anything special & it's pretty slow going at times with a run time that lasts over two hours. I don't know why really but I just sat there watching it & just not being able to get into the story or particularly caring about what was going on, I thought it was alright for sure but just not the solid gold classic I had been lead to believe. Overall a bit of a disappointment as I expected better.Director Eastwood does a fine job although it's likely that some of Kaufman's footage he shot before he was replaced found it's way into the final cut with some impressive cinematography which utilises the barren landscapes & the period detail. There's not much action in this one, no one other than Wales seems able to shoot straight as Wales blows everyone away with out much trouble. As I said this feels more like a drama set in the wild west rather than an action packed shoot 'em up. The violence is kept to a minimum with a few bloody gunshot wounds & nothing else.Technically the film is very good with good period detail & production values, set in Texas it was shot mostly in Arizona & Utah. The acting is fine by all involved. You wouldn't have thought The Outlaw Josey Wales would have much in common with Killer Klowns From Outer Space (1988) but both Royal Dano & John Vernon who appear in this featured in Killer Klowns From Outer Space. From The Outlaw Josey Wales to Killer Klowns From Outer Space, there's not that much difference there.The Outlaw Josey Wales is an average Western as far as I'm concerned but i could easily see how someone might like it much more, I just couldn't get into the story or character's that much unfortunately. Followed by The Return of Josey Wales (1986) with Michael Parks taking Eastwood's staring & directing duties.

I suppose that I am also telling quite a bit of what's going on so, yes, if you haven't seen it, stop here, see it and then come back and see if you don't agree.No, it isn't very deep (as some here have intimated) but it could make you think deep thoughts if you follow the various threads that unfold.Venus Crucified (the blasphemous painting in question) is a pointed reference to the killing of the sacred feminine by the Christian Church (although I do not think that was intended by it's Messiah).The symbolism isn't terribly subtle either, there are snakes in the garden, for sure; but there are a number of references to the savagery of life in mid-twentieth century Australia - people eaten off by sharks and (other) snakes attacking children in a newspaper headline near the end. There was repeated references to the Titanic, too, including, so it seemed, that the minister and his wife may have sailed on it to Australia! (The sirens calling the ship to it's demise? The whole thing a dream of a passenger on that ship?? Who knows, eh?) The symbolism was a bit off in one scene that depicted the minister and bishop going through the museum without looking at any of the wonderful paintings along the gallery on the way to the offensive work; but the church is not above owning a huge collection of art, some of it quite controversial. That bit of 'ignorant indifference' didn't play too well on this viewer; but I suppose it was a jab at the tight-assed attitude of the clergy in general.The girls are charming in the old fashioned sense - just as the original sirens charmed sailors to their doom, they charmed the minister's wife to her 'moral doom'.Dream sequences were, like real dreams, sometimes hard to know if they were 'real' or not - just as Gidy is conned into thinking what she really saw was just her dream; and that dream was 'telling her' to do what she wanted to do in the first place.Near the end when Devlin catches the hammer, it all fell into perspective, not only for me but for Estella as well.I don't think this film was ever intended to be a deep, heavy look into any morality; it was a bit of a romp through the human condition leaving one with a little fatalistic approach to morality - life has many ugly sides (sharks, snakes, etc.) but leave room for a little fun too. The minister (Anthony\/Hugh Grant) also allows that some things are best not told. There is a difference between not telling something and telling a lie, though; and that was left right out.Frankly the morality being sold in this flick is just a bit too frivolous for real life, at least in most settings. People do get hurt, lives are affected, and there are often consequences for those so-called harmless trysts. John Lennon would have us Imagine this and that but in the end he lived the good life off of the proceeds of his capitalistic ventures. That is how life is; this movie is how dreams are. All-in-all, it was nice dream. That's what movies should be; so in being that, it was a very good movie.
