I hope the 2001 version takes all the technological gifts we have and does a great job of reproducing the original and doesn't have Kevin Bacon as a contemporary scientist, doing his thing. The track record is pretty lousy on remakes. I want this one to dazzle us, not exploit us!

We find out that she has a relationship with someone who is secretly cheating on her.  We discover her profession and how she came to get there.

The Kubrick\/Spielberg influences are evident throughout - the almost in some respects clinical set design combined with a level of subdued and well placed lighting that adds a much needed dimension to the visuals.The second act enters the Pinocchio theme - David searches for the mystical 'Blue Fairy' - the only being that can make David into a true boy and therefore be truly loved by his new mother.He is accompanied by another Cybertronics construct, Joe Gigilo, who as the name suggests, is a pleasure unit with a sassy step and quick wit.

While I am definitely not here to rebut these comments, as is always said, everyone has their own opinion. My reason for posting this most likely long winded review is not only to say how much I enjoyed A.I., but also to say why this film is rich, and very rewarding, if not, an absolute mind job.First, the acting. Incredible job by Haley Joel Osment, this kid will most certainly go far; every action David responds to or does himself is so pure and filled with a childlike wonder. Yet at the same time I couldn't help but feel sorry for him at times, because all he wanted to do was love - and people were not giving him the programmed response he was made with, or expected, you could say. This only made him more confused, and more sad. Then we have Gigolo Joe - the freshest character I have seen in years. You can't help but love the guy, he's funny, he's wise and he always seems to know what to do. The line said to him, 'Hey Joe, whaddya know?' is simple yet has huge remembrance, and will probably be used (again) for quite a while after the film. Even the rest of the cast, minor parts, extras, must deserve mention - The mother, who just can't get over grieving for her real son, and then forced to endure this robot boy (or mecha, as they are called). At times David weirds her out, other times she just doesn't get him. The father, who's just trying to keep a family together; other mecha's, who try to serve as best they can, or who just try to survive against a world still filled with hatred for things that are different.Second, the story. What can I say? I seriously do not know. Admittedly it is very weird. Very, very warped and tones that only Kubrick could manage to pull off in a way that simply oozes atmosphere. People, be thankful Spielberg was at the helm for this one - he's turned the vomittron rollercoaster down a notch and made us comfortable in viewing Kubricks warped masterpiece. Not too sure how much Spielberg influence went into the 'world' and setting, but the viewer only has a glimpse of a futuristic world and society that could have been much more. This, however, is where the richness I was talking about before comes into it. The main characters, and how they respond to this world are full of emotion and, like the viewer, full of questions too. I can't (and I won't) even begin to describe the complications, ramifications and plot matter David and Gigolo Joe go through in their time together. If you've come across the Japanese animation likes of Neon Genesis Evangelion, Serial Experiments Lain or even Boogiepop Phantom, these three are just about the only things I can compare to the film A.I. to.

My reason for posting this most likely long winded review is not only to say how much I enjoyed A.I., but also to say why this film is rich, and very rewarding, if not, an absolute mind job.First, the acting. Incredible job by Haley Joel Osment, this kid will most certainly go far; every action David responds to or does himself is so pure and filled with a childlike wonder. Yet at the same time I couldn't help but feel sorry for him at times, because all he wanted to do was love - and people were not giving him the programmed response he was made with, or expected, you could say. This only made him more confused, and more sad. Then we have Gigolo Joe - the freshest character I have seen in years. You can't help but love the guy, he's funny, he's wise and he always seems to know what to do. The line said to him, 'Hey Joe, whaddya know?' is simple yet has huge remembrance, and will probably be used (again) for quite a while after the film. Even the rest of the cast, minor parts, extras, must deserve mention - The mother, who just can't get over grieving for her real son, and then forced to endure this robot boy (or mecha, as they are called). At times David weirds her out, other times she just doesn't get him. The father, who's just trying to keep a family together; other mecha's, who try to serve as best they can, or who just try to survive against a world still filled with hatred for things that are different.Second, the story. What can I say? I seriously do not know. Admittedly it is very weird. Very, very warped and tones that only Kubrick could manage to pull off in a way that simply oozes atmosphere. People, be thankful Spielberg was at the helm for this one - he's turned the vomittron rollercoaster down a notch and made us comfortable in viewing Kubricks warped masterpiece. Not too sure how much Spielberg influence went into the 'world' and setting, but the viewer only has a glimpse of a futuristic world and society that could have been much more. This, however, is where the richness I was talking about before comes into it. The main characters, and how they respond to this world are full of emotion and, like the viewer, full of questions too. I can't (and I won't) even begin to describe the complications, ramifications and plot matter David and Gigolo Joe go through in their time together. If you've come across the Japanese animation likes of Neon Genesis Evangelion, Serial Experiments Lain or even Boogiepop Phantom, these three are just about the only things I can compare to the film A.I. to.

Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against the Bond films, but a film like this is much more valuable and unique in its approach and doesn't cut corners to please the crowd.  The film is highlighted by two great performances.  I've never seen Pierce Brosnan play a villain.  I've always admired his method of acting.  He has that cool, suave, seductive presence.  Hell, I'm a heterosexual male and I feel seduced by him at times.  After all these years in the biz, he's still a very handsome man.  As a villain, he still plays that cool Bond-like character, but with a dark, sadistic twist.  Geoffrey Rush is one of my favorite actors.  I loved him in Shine and I loved him in Quills.  He's a terrific method actor who WILL go the whole nine for his roles.  In this case, he learned all there was to know about tailoring.  He delivers another captivating, memorable performance and I hope he wins the Oscar this year, to make up for him losing for Quills.  Veteran Irish actor Brendan Gleeson is superb as an alcoholic Panamanian who led the rebellion against General Noreiga.

John Boorman is a veteran director (Hope and Glory, Deliverance) and he believes in getting authentic shots of Panama, rather than shooting in Puerto Rico or Cuba like some other filmmaker would probably do to cut corners.  And there are some great shots of the beautiful scenery.  There's no Central Casting Agency in Panama, so all the cops we see are real cops, all the hookers are real hookers.

It sure didn't look like much in the previews.  That's why I found it surprisingly delightful.  I laughed a good deal, and often kept a smile on my face.  There are certain moments where they push the fish-out-of-water gags too far (drinking out the toilet?  that was too much!) and brief moments of crude humor that we could've done without.  But we are stuck in the eye of this tornado of gross-out comedies, and believe me this is nothing!  I think you'll find it surprisingly tame, and you can even watch it with the whole family. Watching the great Jean Reno is worth the admission alone.  He turns in another fine performance.  Of course, I wasn't too thrilled (like always) about the little subplot involving Christina Applegate's nice, naive character engaged to this stuck-up, unlikable airhead (Matt Ross).  But I'm going to let that slide, since it was damn funny watching his stuck-up character get humiliated in some of the gags.  Then again, this is a magical fantasy where it's important to suspend disbelief.  I also have to note Tara Reid, who annoyed the hell out of me as the stereotypical blonde airhead in Josie and the Pussycats.

This is the kind of quirky, dangerous, offbeat humor the intelligent moviegoer can really sink his teeth into; toss in a couple of characters you care about, a couple of characters you really want to see get hurt, a storyline you don't expect, and add some way flash dialogue.  The musical choices made for this movie are perfect; I downloaded a couple of singles from the soundtrack and then just went out and bought the cd.  If you enjoyed Get Shorty, Pulp Fiction, or Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, do not wait one more minute you must go now and rent this film.

Perhaps the story is a little convoluted but a couple (let alone my 50+) viewings will clarify the plot, and the complexity of structure only adds interest each time you watch it. It may not quite be Mitchum's best performance but is his (and Jane Greer's) best film.It's a very unusual film of its time in the use of real locations and the minimising of back projection and artificial sets. I love films with exotic locations so Acapulco and San Francisco do very nicely. For example using real settings for the evening beach and human fishing scenes is so much superior to using a studio lot, and since this was a B film on its release we can only imagine how awful some of these sets might  have been with its modest budget. The cinematography of Nicholas Musuraca is superb, lending realism so much so that you can almost smell the grease at the gas station and feel the breeze coming off the lake in the opening scene. The dialogue is both clever and witty and worthy of Raymond Chandler  himself. It gives great lines to many characters in a film that has many interesting supporting roles and reveals enough about many of them to extend them to 3 dimensions. Whit Sterling, as played by Kirk Douglas, is a powerful villain with a certain sly charm. Joe Stephanos an apparently easygoing heavy still carries his inferiority complex (vis-a-vis Jeff Bailey) with an insight into his doomed future. Even the Kid 'speaks'  volumes on his understanding of Jeff's confused and complex character. Jane Greer was perfect as the beautifully cold Kathie Moffat who has all the men wrapped around her fingers showing the lovability of a Preying Mantis. Well writting about this film just makes me want to watch it again, I just love this movie and you should too !

That said, this was so bad I found it unwatchable. It is bad enough to watch a horror film where the characters\/victims are stupid.  To have to watch a horror film where the characters are beyond stupid and just robotically performing totally unbelievable antics simply because they were contrived and written down by a writer in an amateurish script is intolerable.This film starts out with a static shot of a rolling, deserted two lane highway.  Two headlights appear on the horizon.  As they approach the voices of two people can be faintly heard.  As the car approaches, the voices grow in volume.  Then, the car dips behind a ridge and the voices become quiet. The car crests the ridge, much closer now, and we can finally clearly hear the two inhabitants talking in the car.  Finally the car passes camera as we cut to the interior.  Total elapsed time somwhere between two minutes and a lifetime.  I couldn't tell specifically.  I almost fell asleep.  Bernardo Bertolucci would have even cautioned against a shot this long.Soon after, a supercharged, old, rusty truck with blackened windows harasses the two occupants of the car from the opening shot by honking its horn and swerving back and forth behind them.  The teenage boy suddenly forgets how to drive a car and starts swerving around too.  The girl, his sister, becomes hysterical and starts screaming at her brother.  Finally the old truck makes it past them.  I believe that the driver in the truck was just frustrated with having to share the road with such idiots.  The truck drives off ahead.At this point about sixty-eight years of insipid dialog occur between the brother and sister.  All this made worse by the constant cracking of the boy's voice.  I guess by the dialog that they are supposed to be college age, yet he is clearly going through puberty judging by the jarring pitch shifts into the stratosphere that his voice undergoes.Finally the kids in the car catch up to the driver of the truck who is dumping bodies wrapped in sheets into a drain pipe.  The truck driver sees them and gets back in his truck.  He zooms up to the kids and smashes their car off the road into a field.  Does the truck driver stop at this point, get out and kill the two kids?  Of course not.  That wasn't written in the script dummy.This film had not a single thing of any value within the first half hour. It may have had Oscar quality material in the middle and end but I can't possible see how.  At least there were a couple of good visual effects shots in Battlefield Earth (possibly the worst film ever... until now).
