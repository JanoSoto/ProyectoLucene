[{"date":"4 April 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Milo&#x9A; Forman is a legendary filmmaker, he's made the best of films during his heyday. I've always been a fan of his, always loved his work. 'Man Of The Moon' however, ranks amongst his okay efforts. A biographical film about the late American entertainer Andy Kaufman, comes a biopic, that doesn't really entertain.Kaufman was an amazing entertainer, who got in Tony Clifton & Latka Gravas, both of which are legendary today. 'Man On The Moon' brings the biopic to life, but, it could've been better. The film beings with a bang, but slides as soon Kaufman becomes a flop star. Some biopics are worth-watching again and again and again, but 'Man On The Moon', despite being an honest effort, isn't one of those gems.Carrey is the highlight of the film, playing Kaufman from top to bottom. He's fantastic in every dialog he delivers, A Golden Globe isn't all, he at least deserved to earn a Nomination at the Academy Awards. Courtney Love is excellent. She's always been an actress to watch! DeVito is his usual self, which is passable. Paul Giamatti is good, while Jerry Lawler hams.On the whole, 'Man On The Moon' isn't the best biopic in any angle, but it surely deserves a watch for Carrey's fantastic performance.
