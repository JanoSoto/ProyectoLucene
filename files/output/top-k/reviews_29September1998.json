[{"date":"29 September 1998","score":"","review":"  Ronin is a great action film that seems to want to be a character study and doesn't quite make it, but it remains a great action film nonetheless. De Niro plays a former American government agent who has been hired by an Irish woman named Dierdre (McElhone) to obtain, as part of a team of other shadowy folk, the film's McGuffin, a briefcase with an unknown valuable something in it, a la Pulp Fiction.  What follows is a number of rather amusing, but not very deep, dialogue scenes interspersed with some magnificent action sequences.  The longest car chase in the film (there are several) has to stand as one of the finest examples of this action-movie mainstay.  It is notable for its impressive technical proficiency, its high excitment level, and for the great joy that the director seems to have taken in making it; the number of destroyed automobiles left in its wake reach almost Blues Brothers-esque proportions.  There are a number of other impressive action scenes, all set in very scenic parts of France, and together they form the real core of the movie.  The De Niro character is given quite a bit of development time, but I at least never felt that I learned that much about his true motivations and feelings.  No matter; the visceral aspects of this movie are more than enough to make it well worth seeing.Overall Rating 8 (out of 10), or 3 1\/2 stars (out of 4) ","genre":null},{"date":"29 September 1998","score":"","review":"  Ronin is a great action film that seems to want to be a character study and doesn't quite make it, but it remains a great action film nonetheless.

Deniro is well cast as a expatriate CIA operative that is the somewhat moral center of this tale.  The car chases however are very well done, reminiscent of The French Connection.  Jean Reno also gives a strong performance, contrasting and blending with Deniro quite well.  Not a classic by any means, but a well executed thriller with a well-thought out story.
