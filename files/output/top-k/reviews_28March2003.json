What I got was a scary, thrilling, fun, occasionally hilarious, and overall excellent...  meld of Duel and The Hitcher.Okay, so the plot is nothing special, and we've seen it all before, but that is a very easy flaw to forgive once this movie gets rolling, because it is just so damned good!I didn't think Hollywood was making films like this any more.  The core cast is pretty, of course, but they are none the less excellent.  Steve Zahn has flawless comic timing, even making me laugh with gallows humour during some of the more tense scenes.  Walker should be bland and boring, but somehow he isn't.  As Zahn's little brother, he is engaging and likeable.  Leelee Sobieski isn't given much to do, sadly, but she is very pleasant to watch on the screen, and is a fine actress in her own right.  A bit more character development would have made her just as engaging as the two brothers.Dahl directs with considerable talent and style.  The action and suspense scenes are superb, but his quieter moments of romance, family matters, and humour are also handled very well.  We get to peek into the trio's minds and emotions, and come to like them and care about their fate.  When things get rough, the film is even more nerve-wracking because the bad stuff on the screen is happening to solid, real characters who we care about.  Let me tell you, the tension gets close to unbearable.  I was yelling at the screen - No!  Don't do it!  Don't open the door! and so on - which is something I rarely do.My advice to you is, if you like horror, action, and suspense, rush out and rent or buy this film immediately.  Don't watch the trailer, though, as it spoils some great moments.See it in a double feature with Jeepers Creepers, the other surprisingly good teen horror road movie of recent years.

That being The Man with No Name trilogy.Here we have three strong characters surviving for themselves and for survival sakes.  They go through a common search for confederate gold.  While they are doing this, all around them the world is going insane in one of the most brutal and bloodiest wars every.  We are talking about the Civil War of course.    Who are the Characters.  They are the characters of the title of course;The Good - Clint Eastwood.  A hired mercenary, who is tired of playing by the rules, because there are none.  He kills other mercenaries, for the express intent of stealing their human bounty.  He, like the other two goes through the film trying to get his hands on stolen confederate gold for the express purpose of personnel wealth.  Yet he is good, because, like in the previous two films of the trilogy he has a conscience, and at times cares about his victims and at times makes decisions to have mercy.   To me he represents God.   He is silent and gives out vengeance like god.  He is also merciful.The Bad - Lee Van Cleef.   In a role completely cut off from his role in #2 of the series (For a few dollars more).  He has the same purpose as the Good, but he has no morals at all.  He has no pity, and enjoys his acts of giving pain to others.  He represents the Devil.  He is even called angel eyes.   Remember the Satan is a fallen angel?  The ugly - Eli Wallach.  In his greatest role.   Also goes through the film with the same purpose as the others.  He is a thief and cold blooded killer.  He has little pity and even less conscience.  But he does not play out his actions out of joy, but rather for plain survival.  Killing and stealing is all he knows, and he is played with and used in turn by both The Good (god) and the Bad (Satan).  He represents the common man.   This is also the reason that he is the most compelling character in the film.It is true that what I have said up to know sounds allegoric and surreal.

","genre":"Western"},{"date":"28 March 2003","score":"24 out of 32 people found the following review useful","review":"  This is a pretty good drama with an excellent cast of characters.  The story centers around Michael Douglas, who plays a division head in a high tech company in Seattle that is undergoing a merger.  Demi Moore plays his old girlfriend, an aggressive corporate executive, who comes in and snatches away the job promotion he was counting on, then failing to seduce him after hours, files a false sexual harassment with the company in order to get rid of him.It's interesting that although the story revolves around Michael Douglas's plight, it's the women who set the events in motion and who help the protagonist resolve the problem he's presented with.  Female empowerment is the main theme of this movie.Demi Moore gets perhaps her best movie role ever by playing the sexual predator to Michael Douglas's easygoing mid-level manager.  She knows how to play the corporate game much better than him, and quickly boxes him into a dicey situation.  How does a guy explain that it was his female boss who hit on him and not the other way around as she claims?   Demi Moore controls the situation well for most of the movie, and plays the villain so well that the viewer really enjoys when she finally gets her comeuppance.Roma Maffia does an excellent job of playing Michael Douglas's lawyer.  He's lost on how to respond to the sexual harassment charges and what to do to preserve his job, and she forcefully takes over his defense and steers him towards a successful resolution.  She also understands how the game is played and keeps her nerve when the company comes after her client. Caroline Goodall plays Michael Douglas's wife and displays a perfect combination of anger and support while he resolves the charges against him.  A lawyer herself, she understands the situation her husband has gotten into much better than he does, and is there for him as both an advisor and partner.

Richard Pryor's performance isn't extremely memorable; the actor to see this film for is John Candy, who steals the show as soon as we see him.Pryor plays Brewster, a man who is offered a strange proposition by some elderly men. If he can blow 30 million dollars in a month, he inherits 300 million left to him in a will. If he doesn't, he's left with the remainder of what they give him. And he can NOT tell anyone about their deal. So Brewster agrees, and starts wasting the cash. But soon this turns bad as his good pal John Candy innocently tries to make him money, and people begin to suspect something is wrong. Why is Brewster wasting away his money like it's paper with no value?Brewster's Millions has been done seven times before, apparently, but I could only trace down five a 1914 version, a 1921 version, a 1926 version, a 1935 version, and a 1945 remake with Dennis O'Keefe. That last version ranked in about a half hour shorter than the Richard Pryor film, and this 1985 version probably would have been better off with that length as well.Pryor doesn't really stand out as Brewster. I can think of others who would have fit the part better. But I guess it's good they chose him over Eddie Murphy. John Candy is really the one to keep an eye on during the film, and you can't help but keep an eye on him since he draws your attention from the start. His character is sweet, good-natured, but at the same time a businessman trying to make some dough for him and his pal Pryor. Candy really envelops his character, as always, and steals the show. It's nowhere near his best performance, but it's still great. This is the first comedy outing for director Walter Hill, who went on to film comedies such as Red Heat with Schwarzenegger and Belushi. He uses many of the same formulas as he did in Red Heat, as well. It's never that funny, but worth seeing once or twice. Herschel Weingrad & Timothy Harris, who both wrote the film Trading Places (*see below), use the same humor (see below) in this film as they did in Trading Places. Funny people in odd situations doing odd things. They use a simple theme and expand it. Unfortunately, it didn't expand here as much as it could--and should--have.The beginning of the movie is funny, I'll give it that. When Brewster first gets the money and is trying to blow it--those are the funny parts. It's a bit like films where the hero is learning to adapt to his new abilities (Spider-Man) or the movies where something is very original and funny but starts to get a tiny bit tiresome later on (Delirious). The same goes for Brewster's Millions it is funny in the beginning, but it starts to get a bit tiresome after a while. There are only so many gags available when you are talking about a man having to waste money in a certain amount of days.For some reason, the eighties comedies really sparked an interest in films with people in odd places doing odd things. *Trading Places, Delirious, just to name a few. They are fanciful, imaginative, and sometimes not that funny. Brewster's Millions is the half-way point between funny and average. It is one of those comedies from the eighties retreading familiar terrain. Its humor is that of many comedies from the eighties with famous comedians.

So Happy takes his rough-life to the golf course and single-handedly dismantles what golfing is all about He turns golf into a cool sport, instead of an old sport. He verbally assaults both caddies, spectators and golf balls, throws his golf clubs into the distance, dives under water in a pond to retrieve a missing golf ball, and tackles an alligator on a golf course. Yep, it's Sandler all right. And the best thing about Gilmore is that not only is he a TERRIFIC golf player, but the ratings on the television have gone up major points. Just as everything is starting to turn out for Happy, another problem wanders along. Evil golfer Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald) has purposely bought Grandma's house to tease Happy. So Shooter makes a deal with Happy that if he wins the final competition, he gets the house back.

But regardless of Sandler's personal life and personality, he fit the persona of Happy Gilmore like a glove. I mean, really, who else do you expect to be shouting at people and throwing golf clubs about in a film like this? Exactly. Adam Sandler.There are a lot of stupid things in this movie, including the mandatory on-the-side-romance. But I must say, it's not as tragic as the romance in Billy Madison.I couldn't help but feel the movie took the easy way out a few times, and kind of cheated the audience. For example In one scene they are going over the ratings, and the main golf guy says the ratings are so high that they won't get rid of Gilmore. This is while a television is playing with Happy swearing and throwing golf clubs around. The golf administrators seem pretty pathetically shallow to just say, Hey, the rating's are up! He's a keeper! when Happy is doing that. This may sound like real-life marketing, but when you see the film, you'll know what I mean. Another thing is how almost everything and everyone other than the main characters are a bunch of shallow freaks. The movie plays a lot like Billy Madison in that sort of way. Many of the characters--other than Happy and the main cast--are shallow idiots. Unfortunately, sometimes this results in the audience being treated as an idiot as well. And then there are certain bits that are just too dumb, even for a slapstick of this measure. For example, in one scene, a maniac drives his car onto the golf course and runs over Happy. The way it is done os so over-the-top that you can't help but think, what were they thinking?  But it's not a biggie I don't go into films like these expecting an epic. I just wish they would put a bit more thought into it.Happy Gilmore may not be the most thoughtfully inventive film to come out of Hollywood in recent years, but that doesn't matter in a film like this.

This is the case for almost EVERY review of Unfaithful. Aside from the occasional positive comment that I have read by other IMDB users, and the glowing review given by Margaret Pommeranz on the (Australian) Movie Show (four and a half stars, if I remember correctly), this film seems to have met with either negative or ambivalent reactions from everyone. And this surprises me immensely, because I was overwhelmed by it. I expected quite a good, slightly arty film with good performances (particularly from Diane Lane, who really impressed me in Coppola's The Cotton Club). What I got was a film which I think will be one of my favourites for many years to come.The criticisms that I have read of Unfaithful don't confuse me because they disagree with me. I can accept that - no really, I can, although I don't see how anyone could miss the brilliant acting (one user comment said that any Hollywood actress could have done Diane Lane's performance - well, I DO look forward to the J.Lo remake in a few years), or the amazing photography, this being one of the most lush and seductive films I have seen in a long time. It's the way in which the reviewers have seemingly missed the entire point of the film, or fell asleep half-way through it.Firstly, I will concede that Connie's motivations were unclear (although I'd call it subtlety, rather than poor scripting), but they weren't as unclear as many people would have you believe. Nor did Lyne simplify the relationship between Connie and Paul (someone called him Marcel - perhaps they DID watch another movie, or just couldn't spell his surname) - in fact, I would suggest that anyone who thought Connie was willing to sleep with the first guy she met would do well to rewatch this film and see the way that her mind works (or do you need a voice-over narration in addition to Lane's phenomenal performance?). In addition to this, I have read complaints about nudity (because apparently has no place in an erotic drama\/thriller), technical problems (the reviewer who mentioned this loved the movie, but had issues with constant shots of the entire microphone, shots which he\/she found very hard to ignore, but which I managed to miss completely) and the apparently cliched narrative. In response to the latter, I don't want to give anything away, but this film, although addressing a common topic (ie. adultery), is by no means a traditional Hollywood film, and certainly doesn't treat the topic in the same way that every other film has. Many may find the ending unfulfilling, but I can't comprehend the idea of it being cloying and unoriginal. And even if the narrative itself is conventional, the way in which it is handled by cast, director and technical crew (if you can forgive the microphone shots, I suppose) puts it so far above any of its counterparts as to warrant a much warmer reception than it seems to have been given.Diane Lane deserved the Oscar for this, without question. Unfortunately, her film came in a year when every single Best Actress nominee was of nearly equal quality. As you can see, I liked it - and wish that more people felt the same way about it. The only suggestion I can offer is that, if you have yet to see it, then don't go into it expecting a standard thriller - in fact, it can be quite slow-moving at times. But let it be what it is, because it does a damn good job at that.

Let's go through this one fault at a time, and keep in mind that I didn't whatch all of it, so if it turns brilliant after an hour or so, please accept my apologies- The singing. Meaning the voices and performances of the actors. Not really too bad. But still, someone who could really sing would have been better. It is after all a musical.- The music. Dreadful. Sure, in theory it seems like a good idea to take many different, but good songs, take a bit of this and a bit of that, and give it all the same sound, more or less. But it is just terrible. No song they sing can ever rise above the fact that you have heard it better elsewhere. Not only that, much of the music doesn't fit in, and the whole score is rather weak.- The plot. I really do believe that I could have written a better one myself. There are no surprises, and it is in no way original. This is the greatest dissapointment in the film, that the plot is so transparrent. If you like it because it is a tragic lovestory, there are so many better films out there. Someone compared this movie to west side story. Not a too original plot there either, but the mood and music, not to say the dancing, is completely in another league.- The editing. A bit more personal opinion here; I just didn't like it. Too many scenes were chaotic.I believe that was all. I gave this movie a 1, maby a bit prejudiced by the fact that so many gave it a good rating. I hate it when people admire that which should not be admired.

And about an hour into the movie we turned it of. Why? Because it was really, really boring. Let's go through this one fault at a time, and keep in mind that I didn't whatch all of it, so if it turns brilliant after an hour or so, please accept my apologies- The singing. Meaning the voices and performances of the actors. Not really too bad. But still, someone who could really sing would have been better. It is after all a musical.- The music. Dreadful. Sure, in theory it seems like a good idea to take many different, but good songs, take a bit of this and a bit of that, and give it all the same sound, more or less. But it is just terrible. No song they sing can ever rise above the fact that you have heard it better elsewhere. Not only that, much of the music doesn't fit in, and the whole score is rather weak.- The plot. I really do believe that I could have written a better one myself. There are no surprises, and it is in no way original. This is the greatest dissapointment in the film, that the plot is so transparrent. If you like it because it is a tragic lovestory, there are so many better films out there. Someone compared this movie to west side story. Not a too original plot there either, but the mood and music, not to say the dancing, is completely in another league.- The editing. A bit more personal opinion here; I just didn't like it. Too many scenes were chaotic.I believe that was all. I gave this movie a 1, maby a bit prejudiced by the fact that so many gave it a good rating. I hate it when people admire that which should not be admired. Both me and my friend are interested in films, and have through this developed the sort of expertise that all reviewers here claim to have. This is not a macho-attack on a chick-flick, it is a reflected review of a really boring film.

Paul Verhoeven is just a bad director, and Joe Eszterhas is an even worse writer!  It's not camp, it's just bad.  I might argue that a movie like this is demeaning to women, but it's just too horrible not to laugh at.  I love watching this movie with friends as we laugh our asses off at the ridiculous dialogue and situations. Why the hell would Molly ask this physically and verbally abusive girl to move in with her?  Wouldn't Nomi have to give fingerprints to the police to get a cabaret license to work as a stripper?  Which she wouldn't get because of her criminal record!  You could go crazy trying to justify the contrivances and fill in the plot holes.  They honestly thought they were making a good movie.

Cats Don't Dance can be enjoyed whether you're age 4 (close to my youngest child) or age 40 (close to me).  The movie uses bright and crisp colors which make you pay attention---and you'll have to!  Cats moves at a rapid pace.  I'm always apprehensive when I hear about animated musicals because the songs usually stink.  However, I think the songs and musical sequences in Cats are better than those in most Disney hit movies.  Darla Dimples's performance singing Big And Loud is an animated classic.  My kids sing Cats songs just for fun.  They've seen the movie (by their own request) almost 20 times.  By the way, I knew Natalie Cole was a good singer, but who knew that Scott Bakula was too?  Cats Don't Dance has great dialogue (Danny and Sawyer at her job, the same two cats arguing while a disaster ensues, and Danny meeting with Darla Dimple at her home are among my favorite scenes.  If characters are going to achieve a good and noble goal in a movie, there MUST be worthy foils trying to stop them.  Cats Don't Dance has two of the best villians ever in Darla Dimple and her behemoth of a butler Max.  Darla takes being two-faced to a whole new level.  (Notice at least twice in the movie when the red bow on her head looks more like two horns)  Max is so huge that he actually blocks out light!  His laugh is chillingly amazing and Max the the BEST line of dialogue in the movie How does the kitty cat gooooooooooooooo? Danny 'Meow?'  Very goooooooooood. Every character in this movie (most of whom are animals) are drawn exaggeratedly and that fits perfectly for the theme and tone of this movie. Cats is a funny, wild ride for children and adults.  If you like animation and\/or musicals and\/or clever comedy, you'll love Cats Don't Dance. It's a shame this great movie isn't more popular.  Hopefully good word-of-mouth (and word-of-internet) will change that.

The result is a deft, reckless, amusing and entertaining heavy-handed movie. There isn't much to bicker about here. Meg Ryan and Matthew Broderick show tremendous colour and prove to be likeable characters as the vengeful stalkers. Tcheky Karyo is funny as the clumsy French fool. Kelly Preston is the least convicted of the four main characters, but is still relatively good. The film has its own generally funny slapstick moments that compensate for the lack of verbal wit. The narrative that follows is good enough to keep you wanting more, and the jokes are all very well timed. The title Robert Palmer song adds to the reckless, but endearing epitome of the film. The directing styles aren't amazing, but they're hip and stylish for the most part.Overall, it isn't film of the century and is far from outstanding, but `Addicted to Love' is original, entertaining and very funny for the most part. I give it 6.8 out of 10.
