How could these people in their early twenties be suffering through so many problems? People usually wait until their 40's before going through a mid-life crisis, they argued. Well, let me just say that life immediately after college can be a struggle. My first year after it was pretty much a disaster, but most young people usually figure things out and hit their stride eventually. The characters we meet in St. Elmo's Fire have all kinds of problems to deal with, and it's fun to see the choices and mistakes they make.The cast is terrific, but there are so many main characters that we don't get to know all of them perhaps as well as we'd like to. We have Rob Lowe as a womanizer, dead-beat dad who cannot hold a job. Emilio Estevez only seems interested in winning over Andie MacDowell (who wouldn't be) and will take any job that he feels might impress her. Demi Moore is broke and spends too much time romancing her boss. She looks amazing in this film, as she does in so many others. Mare Winningham is a rich young Jewish gal who'd rather dish out meals to the homeless than go into her family's greeting card business. Ally Sheedy and Judd Nelson have an odd relationship. He screws around constantly on her but justifies his behavior since she refuses to marry him! Sheedy seems like the most normal character by far. Then there's Andrew McCarthy who plays the typically mousy character we've come to associate with him over the years. He's a sensitive writer who most people think is gay since he's never had a girlfriend. He's really been lusting after Sheedy all these years, and at one point in the film, he gets a shot at her.As you might imagine, with all those characters it's hard for the film to stay focused on any of them for very long. Many of their subplots don't always intersect, and even a trip to the bathroom could cause you to miss out on a key plot development or two. Perhaps Joel Schumacher's frenetic pace was not right for the film. I think these characters were strong enough that they should have slowed things down and developed them a little more thoroughly. Maybe John Hughes could have done a better job, but still Schumacher does his best.Most of the problems these characters face do happen to real people to some degree or another. We've all had crushes like Estevez, and they can be truly humiliating. Some of the financial trouble that Moore and Lowe are experiencing can often be cured by simply making better decisions. Those two appeared to be the most screwed up, and least likely to make it in the long run. But at 22, you still have plenty of time left to make things right. Perhaps there is a script out there that covers these characters 20 years down the line, and tells us what they're up to now.The film grossed just under $40 million and is still worth a viewing today. Hard to believe it was rated R when it was released.8 of 10 stars.The Hound.

Jake and crew live in a low income housing area surrounded by stray dogs, wire fences and piles of garbage. Jake is an alcoholic wife beater, and right from the start you are shown just how ugly and mean a man can be.This is a graphic journey into the dangers of living below the poverty line in a bad area and the negative effect it has on a family's life. Jake and wife Beth (an unforgettably strong performance by Rena Owen) have 5 children Nig, Gracie, Mark and 2 younger children who play a very small role. Nig has joined a vicious gang and disowned his father, Mark is taken into social welfare after a court hearing and Gracie is the shinning beacon in this bleak movie. Grace is an intelligent, thoughtful and caring girl who stands by her mother and helps her siblings as best she can, whilst her father drinks, shouts and beats his way through his miserable life.Jake's family suffer under him, most of all his wife, who seems to be on the receiving end of his short temper throughout the film. There is a brutal and violent scene during a drunken house party, where Jake beats his wife to a pulp for refusing to cook eggs for Jake's friend Uncle Bully, you even see her blood on the walls and doors the next morning!!. Beth still sticks with Jake through the violence and appalling behaviour, a point is made that she still loves him, below the tattoo'd beast there is a man she loves.Things take a further descent when Gracie commits suicide by hanging herself in the back garden. It is at this point that Jake and Beth cut ties over their daughters death, after a tense and upfront confrontation in their kitchen. Gracie is then sent off in a traditional Maori funeral in Beth's home village, Gracie's family are all there, all apart from Jake who is drowning his sorrows over another beer.Things come to a climax when Beth discovers Gracie's reason for suicide whilst reading her scrapbook ( a book which Jake earlier ripped apart after Grace answered him back). Beth goes straight to Jake's bar to put some wrong things right...and I couldn't have wished for a better ending.This isn't a pleasant film to watch, but it is powerful and gripping enough to keep you watching till the last minute.

Clark Gable apparently didn't want to be Rhett Butler and did not lobby for an Oscar enough, having one earlier in the 1930's. Gable came in at least third behind Robert Donat (winner-Mr Chips) and Jimmy Stewart. The Rhett Butler in the book was more severe, dangerous, jealous, and frankly more appealing.It is interesting that little info survives about relations between Vivien Leigh and Olivia de Havilland.

But I guess when we are going through a series of experiences many of us turn our face to the concept of God. While the movie makes us think on regret it barely reminds us the concept of divine repentance then this question arises in my mind if you do not see regret in a sense of divinity why do you carry the ending of the movie to a biblical portion?(At the end of the movie, an unlikely event occurs frogs rain from the sky. While the plague of frogs is unexpected,there have been real-life reports of frogs being sucked into waterspouts and raining to the ground miles inland) ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"27 November 2005","score":"9 out of 13 people found the following review useful","review":" After the excellent Exotica, Atom Egoyan misfired with this warped and uninvolving 'adaptation' of Russell Banks's novel. Using the same understated and unsentimental style he employed in Exotica, Egoyan tries to make the story of a bus tragedy in a remote snow-laden Canadian town an intellectual puzzle of sorts; yet this story of small town immorality is in dire need of a Lifetime TV movie makeover rather than a deconstruction of its own willfuly obscure narrative. This is where the film is a spectacular failure - the story is too human for Egoyan's dehumanizing narratives. Egoyan is at sea when it comes to dealing with conventional emotions; he would rather intellectualize as he did in Exotica and The Adjuster. That's why I feel the film feels forced. It's simply not deep enough for Egoyan. So what does he do, he constructs a simplistic analogy with the Pied Piper (not in the novel)that seeks to add depth to the original novel but feels too literary and self-conscious to be cinematic.Yet this is Egoyan's most critically acclaimed film and that is baffling. Ian Holm as the lawyer Mitchell Stevens is miscast. His accent veers from English to Canadian and back again. How do we take him seriously? Sarah Polley is also as understated as ever which seems to be her style. As for the rest, they all perform to expectation which means we have to endure silences and odd, offbeat yet contrived dialog. Egoyan's detached directorial stance which served him in so well in previous film, is exposed here as a ruse. Where pathos and empathy should be invoked by the tragic scenario, the director's own penchant for obscurantism clouds any human interest.

Never hearing good or bad things on it and just knowing that it is similar to Crash (2004). So, instinctively I bought it thinking it will be amazing. To no surprise it is. This film is unlike everything else at the time but it does everything so well.There is approximately 8 stories intertwined, one where Frank T.J. Mackey(Cruise) is a chauvinistic male parading around on stage as if he is god to everyone. Another that deals with Earl Patridge (Robards), Linda Partridge (Moore), and Earl's nurse Phil Parma (Hoffman). See how complicated this is getting and that is just a small portion of how complicated this film is. As far as the acting is concerned it is just amazing, I don't like Tom Cruise that much but I would have to say that this film is his highlight. It is nice to see everyone acting so well and not just one or the other acting better.Everything is shot and lit beautifully and it seems that Anderson is just as amazing with the camera movements as he is with writing such a complicated story. Even if you do not appreciate camera shots you will appreciate a single just over 2 minutes (straight no cuts) long take in the school and studio, in the film. The one major thing that this film had was a great sense of emotion that just keeps building up more and more. As the viewer they suck you in with such a great and funny start where it will slowly but surely get to the climax. If you are watching this film for just a very intense and gripping story like Identity (2003) then you are mistaken. As much as this film is very complicated you will know what is going on half way through the film but that doesn't matter because when you arrived at the conclusion you will be so satisfied with the ending that it will not matter what you knew or didn't know about what was happening or going to happen. In myself saying that you will know the ending is false, because you will not I just say that you will have an understanding of what is going on in the entire film.The only problem anyone that I have heard has had with this film is that it is was too long, well luckily enough I love films that are long because for me they seem like an instant thing. Where you gain just enough time for everything to come to a wonderful conclusion. Such as Meet Joe Black(1998), Gladiator(2000), and Lord of The Rings (2001 - 2003). You will be thinking is this person on dope...LOTR is the perfect amount of time. Well I found that if many films need time to come to a conclusion, then they will. But Magnolia will come to its amazing conclusion without you even knowing it.The only problem with this review is that I can not give out information about the story or else I threaten to ruin the build up to the climax. Instead of myself ruining this film I urge anyone who has not seen or heard of this film to watch it because it is a beautiful thing to go to waste.
