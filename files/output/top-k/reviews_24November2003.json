True, the storyline may have trouble holding the average Joe's attention.  But, as any history major or Civil War buff can tell you, director Ang Lee did his homework when he made Ride With the Devil.If you're looking for a pseudo-historical drama full of modern verbal anachronisms, impossible non-stop action sequences, and numerous clearly unresearched historical contexts, rent Shanghai Knights.  The language in Ride With the Devil reflects most accurately how the people of the time spoke, according to the letters and written narratives we have from that period.  True, the actors in the film may speak slowly and repeat themselves often, but this is true not only of the time but also of Southern dialects of today.  The floweriness of the language reflects the way the people of Jake and Jack's class thought, to the best of our knowledge.The manner in which the cause of Southern liberty was portrayed in the film is also a very non-partisan, as well as accurate, way of putting history into film.  Most southerners owned no slaves, and cared less whether slavery continued forever or ended within minutes.  Thus the New Englander's view of slavery as the sole cause of the war is highly inaccurate from a southern standpoint.  Ride With the Devil portrays the war in the West for what it was--neighbor taking up arms against neighbor simply because an army had invaded their home and caused the inhabitants to take sides.  The scene where Jake and Jack are eating with their host family in the winter holds some of the greatest Civil War movie dialogue I have ever heard.  The host says something to the effect of, The Yankees won't stop until the entire world thinks, acts and speaks as they do.As to the sudden action sequences followed by periods of little or no action, any soldier who has spent time in a combat situation can tell you that this is nothing but accurate.  War (even guerilla war) is a sequence of spending weeks of boredom and training interspersed with moments of intense violence and terror.  I felt that Ride With the Devil portrayed this aspect of the conflict very well.  The bushwhackers in the film talked about things and did things that real bushwhackers would have done during the war. To me, the accuracies in costume, weaponry, fighting and living conditions were astounding.  I was hooked the moment I saw the upturned US belt buckle in the scene where Jake and Jack take revenge for Jack's family's death.  The speech given to the bushwhackers to persuade them to raid Lawrence, Kansas, and the raid, itself, were both very well done and appeared to be very well researched.As to the actual depth of the characters, themselves, it may seem that there is nothing to admire about Jake and his drift-along way of looking at things and living, but that is where the average amateur film critic is wrong.  Many of the men who fought in the war had no deep-rooted convictions about the side on which they served.  Indeed, there are far too many circumstances where we know that men switched sides (especially in the West) periodically for their own well-being or that of their families.  The character of Jake Rodell (Toby McGuire) is typical of the men who fought in that part of the country, merely trying to stay alive and enhance himself in the eyes of his neighbors at the same time.  Jake exhibits the traits of mercy, gratitude and civility far more than any of the other characters in the film.

True, the storyline may have trouble holding the average Joe's attention.  But, as any history major or Civil War buff can tell you, director Ang Lee did his homework when he made Ride With the Devil.If you're looking for a pseudo-historical drama full of modern verbal anachronisms, impossible non-stop action sequences, and numerous clearly unresearched historical contexts, rent Shanghai Knights.  The language in Ride With the Devil reflects most accurately how the people of the time spoke, according to the letters and written narratives we have from that period.  True, the actors in the film may speak slowly and repeat themselves often, but this is true not only of the time but also of Southern dialects of today.  The floweriness of the language reflects the way the people of Jake and Jack's class thought, to the best of our knowledge.The manner in which the cause of Southern liberty was portrayed in the film is also a very non-partisan, as well as accurate, way of putting history into film.  Most southerners owned no slaves, and cared less whether slavery continued forever or ended within minutes.  Thus the New Englander's view of slavery as the sole cause of the war is highly inaccurate from a southern standpoint.  Ride With the Devil portrays the war in the West for what it was--neighbor taking up arms against neighbor simply because an army had invaded their home and caused the inhabitants to take sides.  The scene where Jake and Jack are eating with their host family in the winter holds some of the greatest Civil War movie dialogue I have ever heard.  The host says something to the effect of, The Yankees won't stop until the entire world thinks, acts and speaks as they do.As to the sudden action sequences followed by periods of little or no action, any soldier who has spent time in a combat situation can tell you that this is nothing but accurate.  War (even guerilla war) is a sequence of spending weeks of boredom and training interspersed with moments of intense violence and terror.  I felt that Ride With the Devil portrayed this aspect of the conflict very well.  The bushwhackers in the film talked about things and did things that real bushwhackers would have done during the war. To me, the accuracies in costume, weaponry, fighting and living conditions were astounding.  I was hooked the moment I saw the upturned US belt buckle in the scene where Jake and Jack take revenge for Jack's family's death.  The speech given to the bushwhackers to persuade them to raid Lawrence, Kansas, and the raid, itself, were both very well done and appeared to be very well researched.As to the actual depth of the characters, themselves, it may seem that there is nothing to admire about Jake and his drift-along way of looking at things and living, but that is where the average amateur film critic is wrong.  Many of the men who fought in the war had no deep-rooted convictions about the side on which they served.  Indeed, there are far too many circumstances where we know that men switched sides (especially in the West) periodically for their own well-being or that of their families.  The character of Jake Rodell (Toby McGuire) is typical of the men who fought in that part of the country, merely trying to stay alive and enhance himself in the eyes of his neighbors at the same time.  Jake exhibits the traits of mercy, gratitude and civility far more than any of the other characters in the film.

You have your cowboys and Indians chasing each other, exciting chase and fight scenes and some sort of a plot or another.  What was just described is your typical western movie.  Yet, `The Searchers' didn't seem to follow this generality of movie making.  \tAlthough there were many negative things about the movie, it stepped away from the `norm' and that is a very positive aspect to the film. \tThe opening scene has a door opening, and the story begins.  `The Searchers' is a tale of a tragic event, which causes a little girl, Debbie (Natalie Wood), to get taken away from her Uncle, Ethan (John Wayne), and brother, Martin (Geoffrey Hunter), among her immediate family.  Once Ethan and Marty notice that Debbie was missing, they take off by horse and search for her for years to come.   This is about the extent of the plot.  Doesn't sound very exciting, and well, to be honest, sometimes it really isn't.  The movie didn't necessarily make you lose interest in it; it was just slow and very repetitive sometimes.  \t`The Searchers' seemed to skip from scene to scene very abruptly and it would introduce characters into a new scene without even mentioning them, leaving you to wonder where they came from and how they got there.\t`The Searchers' seemed to often skip from idea to idea as well.  There would be something happening in one scene and there would be questions coming up in your mind, such as, `why are they going there?' or `where did that come from?'  For example, in one part of the film, Ethan and a few others went out into the desert on horseback, and while they were leaving, Mrs. Edwards went after them saying something to the extent of `no Ethan, don't go!' Yet, it doesn't explain why he's leaving or what he's leaving for.\tOverall, the movie was rather confusing, yet at the same time it was still very well done.  Another issue the movie had was the acting.  Half of the acting was tolerable, but the other half wasn't even nearly close to that.  I think the worst actor\/actress in the entire movie was, one of the daughters, Lucy.  She was random and she had no expressions.  Harsh, but her acting talent was non-existent.  John Wayne and Geoffrey Hunter are about the only ones with any talent in their body, so it seems.   So, as discussed thus far, there are problems with acting and the portrayal of scenes and ideas.  Though, the cinematography of the movie was wonderful.  The sets were well done and well placed, while the costumes of the characters were also portrayed very well.  `The Searchers' had perfect music, as well.  It's been said that, in plays, `a good pit is never heard.'  Well, the same idea goes for movies.  If the musicality of the movie is just right, nothing will stick out, and that is exactly what happened in this movie.  It was placed at the right times and it never stuck out, giving the movie just the right zing to it. So, in short, `The Searchers' is lacking in acting ability and plot, but the overall feel of the film is what makes the balance perfect and is what makes it become a great film.  Possessing the title of one of the best westerns ever made is one name that should stay with `The Searchers.'  Even though the movie is slow at times, it is definitely worthwhile to watch.  Opening with a clever beginning scene, it does just the opposite in the latter, so with a door closing, the plot has finally wrapped and the film has ended.

The subject of 'The Good Son' is kind of disturbing and also somewhat unrealistic.The plot is basically as follows. Elijah Wood plays a young boy who's mother died and his father leaves him with his uncle and his wife's house in Maine. There he befriends his cousin, played by Macaulay Culkin. Soon Wood discovers his cousin's homicidal tendencies (kills a dog, causes a pile-up, etc.). It comes to a whole new level when Wood finds out Culkin's character killed his baby brother several years ago, and plans to kill his younger sister. He threatens to tell his aunt and uncle, but Culkin makes it clear he won't allow that.Overall, 'The Good Son,' is an average thriller. Some chills here and there and a decent climax, but the film has many flaws. First, the script isn't that great, and the dialogue is unrealistic (esp. Macaulay's character, which seems more like an philosophical serial killer than a disturbed child). The plot itself is unrealistic (I doubt there have been very many homicidal children). The acting is also mediocre, neither of the leads show any real talent in their roles.My biggest problem with this film is that it's subject matter is extremely disturbing. Who really wants to see a movie where a young boy - that could be their son, nephew, grandson, etc. - kill off his siblings? I'd have to wonder what disturbed minds in Hollywood thought out this film. I could've probably forgiven this film's poorly thought-ought plot, had everything else about the film been good.Want to see a great thriller? Check out Hitchcock or something along the lines of 'The Sixth Sense.' This movie is a low-end thriller with very little thrills and overall, isn't too entertaining.Rating 4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"24 November 2003","score":"3 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":"  The first thing I noticed about the plot of this film is that it's awful similar to 'The Bad Seed,' in which a young girl is the homicidal child.

Elijah Wood plays a young boy who's mother died and his father leaves him with his uncle and his wife's house in Maine. There he befriends his cousin, played by Macaulay Culkin. Soon Wood discovers his cousin's homicidal tendencies (kills a dog, causes a pile-up, etc.). It comes to a whole new level when Wood finds out Culkin's character killed his baby brother several years ago, and plans to kill his younger sister. He threatens to tell his aunt and uncle, but Culkin makes it clear he won't allow that.Overall, 'The Good Son,' is an average thriller. Some chills here and there and a decent climax, but the film has many flaws. First, the script isn't that great, and the dialogue is unrealistic (esp. Macaulay's character, which seems more like an philosophical serial killer than a disturbed child). The plot itself is unrealistic (I doubt there have been very many homicidal children). The acting is also mediocre, neither of the leads show any real talent in their roles.My biggest problem with this film is that it's subject matter is extremely disturbing. Who really wants to see a movie where a young boy - that could be their son, nephew, grandson, etc. - kill off his siblings? I'd have to wonder what disturbed minds in Hollywood thought out this film. I could've probably forgiven this film's poorly thought-ought plot, had everything else about the film been good.Want to see a great thriller? Check out Hitchcock or something along the lines of 'The Sixth Sense.' This movie is a low-end thriller with very little thrills and overall, isn't too entertaining.Rating 4\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"24 November 2003","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Decent drug movie, complete with Velvet's reference in the title.  I thought it was about on par with Requiem for a Dream, which I also liked.  Crudup is a very watchable actor, and Black is always a good time.I had to laugh after reading a review on the Allmovie.com web-site.  Here's a snippet of that review;>>Along FH's journey to self-enlightenment, however, we're treated to a smattering of compelling moments the shocking car accident that opens the film; the split-screen overdose of demented building contractor Wayne (Denis Leary, in an all-too-brief performance); and the surreal hospital job FH and his friend Georgie (the ubiquitous Jack Black) keep in order to score drugs - any drugs. Our hero occasionally lapses into hallucinatory dream sequences which, at their best, recall Fellini; at their worst, they feel like warmed-over fantasy sequences from Ally McBeal.<<I was reading this online while watching the film, and just about blew a gasket when Greg Germann from Ally showed up in the 1st hospital room emergency scene (which was the best part of the movie for me).I think the thing that hit me the most (again) was the soundtrack, especially the Tommy Roe song Sweet Pea.  I haven't heard that song since my sister quit buying 45's around 1969, and I listen to a lot of retro radio shows (including a cool three hour 60's & 70's show every Sunday).  Kudos to Alison Maclean and the producers for unearthing that one.  I was really stunned, and had to go back and watch Samantha Morton's bump-n-grind to it again.  The rest of the period music was also good (including the recent Wilco cuts), but for some reason, Imdb doesn't have a soundtrack listing on the site for JESUS' SON!  What's up with that?

Quite a few of the jokes were misfires, and some of them,were unfunny, but this is a mostly pretty funny spoof of Dracula that i enjoyed very much. I saw this years a go on VHS and enjoyed it then, so i decided to pick up the DVD, and i'm glad i did, because it's a pretty funny film, with great characters and performances. Most of the critics panned this, however i don't see why, sure it has quite a few jokes that are unfunny, however there plenty of laughs to be had, and it's an enjoyable viewing any time. It had some great lines (Master Master, I mean Mister Mister!), and it was fun to watch Leslie steal Lugosi's accent. This is a funny film, that i highly recommend you give it a watch, buy it if you get it cheap. The Direction is good. Mel Brooks does a good job here adding lots of slapstick humor good camera work, and he kept the film funny for the most part throughout. there is a tiny bit of blood. we get a bloody paper cut, and, a impaling with a stake(extremely bloody, but it's all comical). The Acting is excellent!.Leslie Nielsen is AMAZING as always and was hilarious here, i loved the Bela like accent, and he was a lot of fun to watch! (Leslie rules!). Peter MacNicol is extremely hilarious here, i absolutely love this guy, he is one funny guy, and he was fantastic here as Renfield, and has some of the funniest lines. Steven Weber was okay but got on my nerves, and his chemistry with Amy Yasbeck was off. Amy Yasbeck is gorgeous, and does fine with what she has to do.Mel Brooks is very funny as Van Helsing i liked him. Lysette Anthony is okay and nothing more.
