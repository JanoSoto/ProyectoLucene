I've read the reviews given and I gather it took a bit of a caning from the US critics, but from the reviews provided by the general public it seems more to be a 'love it or hate it' type movie and the fact that a fair few seem to love it, touting it as the worst movie ever made seems a bit harsh.I got to see this movie recently (on digital satellite in the UK), and I found it to be quite amusing. Its by no means a classic and is unlikely to ever be presented in a Top 100 Comedies list, but there's enough here to warrant a viewing at least. As a Brit I have absolutely no idea who Lewis and Clark were (although I can make an assumption having watched this movie) so the historical aspect is lost on me but I don't think that's particularly important or hinders the enjoyment of the film. In basic terms this film follows an expedition to be the first to reach the Pacific side of America.The characters are sufficiently different to each other and the cast play their roles as well as can be expected. Perry's style is most definitely based on visual and facial expressions and he uses it well as the foppish Leslie Edwards. Farley plays the over-the-top lout with no graces which forms the basis of most of his roles and he provides a suitable complement to Perry's character. The leading lady (Lisa Barbuscia)  is absolutely stunning although she isn't used a great deal. The rest of the supporting cast do their jobs well, providing an alternative target for the humour. The humour presented here is not particularly sophisticated, but the film has some funny moments while the rest is at least amusing enough to raise a smile and keep you watching - if you like this kind of humour that is. Its mainly slapstick and the dialogue is a poor-man's Blazing Saddles.The first 15 minutes of the film gives you a reasonable idea of what is to follow, and if you hated it up to that point you probably are not going to enjoy the rest. Its one of those films that either strikes a chord with you or falls flat - if you are in the latter camp you will hate it, but that does not necessarily make it a terrible film.

It was successful in this regard, grossing (no pun intended) close to $70 million on a meager $15 million budget.  The film clearly targets MTV males and it knows its audience, offering plenty of gratuitous female nudity and chauvinistic aphorisms like, `It's not cheating if you're not in the same area code.'  I really don't have a problem with nudity, but having half a dozen scenes that linger gapingly on topless women who don't contribute anything to the story is nothing more than tasteless voyeurism used to pump up the testosterone factor.The story itself is a flimsy and predictable excuse for a sitcom.  Writer\/Director Todd Phillips throws so much outlandish foolishness at the audience that he can't help but get a laugh every few minutes.  In this regard, I have to give him credit for a job well done.  He manages the actors and the comedy bits well and keeps the pace up.The acting is probably the best part of the film.  Breckin Meyer is excellent as the tortured hero trying to beat the videotape of his indiscretion to his girlfriend's dorm room.

Angela Bennett (Bullock) is a computer whiz kid who works out of her home finding flaws in and debugging new programs sent to her on disc by her employer.  One day she inadvertently stumbles across one that is so big it sets off a chain reaction of intrigue that places her at the eye of the storm, though she hasn't a clue as to what it's all about.  All she knows is that suddenly she's not herself any more; at least according the records stored on hard drives everywhere.  And it's only the beginning of complications, the likes of which would give anyone with even the slightest bit of paranoia nightmares. \tWith a plot that would make Kafka proud, this precursor to the even more paranoia-inducing `Enemy Of The State,' is a dark, cautionary tale of the misuse of a  technology that has quickly encompassed virtually every walk of life, yet without anyone having first harnessed the full fury of it's potential.  A work of fiction?  Of course; one could even say `science' fiction.  But in this case the technology is already in place, and anyone who wants YOU badly enough need look no further than the data base of the DMV, a credit card bureau or the Post Office, and they will quickly know more about you than you know yourself.  For those who would scoff, there's an old adage that goes something like  Anything that can be used `for' you can also be used `against' you.  At the very least it's food for thought that could keep those with opposing views on the matter debating endlessly.  Or, as in this case of this movie, it's enough to drive the average computer hacker to the brink of madness.  Shades of Lovecraft. \tAt any rate, Winkler has given us an engrossing film that is intense and so exasperating, as you can only sit by and watch helplessly as he puts Angela through her paces, while Bullock makes it all convincing with an excellent performance, making Angela believable as an average girl-next-door whose frame of reference doesn't go much beyond her computer screen.  And all without making her too innocent or naive; she strikes an honest chord with her character that makes her one with whom the audience can readily identify, which is one of the strengths of the movie.  She evokes such empathy that it's easy to feel what it would be like to be in her place; and through her eyes, it's not a pretty sight.   \tThe supporting cast includes Jeremy Northam (Jack), Dennis Miller (Alan), Diane Baker (Mrs. Bennett), Wendy Gazelle (Ruth Marx) and Ken Howard (Bergstrom).

And if `The Net' is any indication, buckle your seat belts, because it's going to be an intense, bumpy-- and highly entertaining-- ride (as already evidenced by `The Matrix,' as well as the aforementioned `EOTS').  It's inevitable that the questions of possibility or probability will arise, especially when a film like this has a contemporary setting; but the most important thing to remember is that if projects such as this fall into capable hands, we'll all be in for some exciting cinema.

The only songs are the opening and closing credits (by Tom Jones and Sting, respectively).  Instead, it's the animated tale of redemption.Now, it's a silly movie.  The humor is hardly highbrow.  A lot of it relies upon the snideness of David Spade's persona, but I like that sort of thing and I laughed all the way through it.And with Eartha Kitt in this, it becomes that much better.  She makes the perfect villain (and with a small nod to her past as Catwoman from the old TV Batman series).The jokes come fast and furious with the jabs and barbs hitting everyone, including the movie, itself.  Dare I say it?  Yes, I do.  Disney has finally figured out that spark of zaniness that has always been a hallmark of Warner Brothers cartoons.  I've always felt that Warner Brothers knew how to make a short while Disney knew how to make a full-length and never the twain shall meet.

Finally I had the chance to see it on video, and I must say this movie kicks every tearjerker Hollywood movie out there. I do not mean to classify this a tearjerker, 'cause it is not.It is a tale of people living with a dark secret and wanting to get rid of this finally after a long time. I did not know the secret before I started watching this, so 30 minutes or so into the movie it hit me smack in the face as if I had driven into a wall at 50 mph. It was so shocking to hear it that I felt very uncomfortable watching people in so much pain being misunderstood, exiled.The biggest asset in this movie must be the Dogme 95 Manifest. The emotions in the story are perfectly portrayed by all of the magnificent cast, who are truly awesome. The emotions do not come from some composer's teary soundtrack or a director of photography's lighting, this is pure and simple an actor's movie. Vinterberg directs this cast with such confidence that you are bolted to your chair for 105 minutes.The symbolic constant reappearance of Christian (Ulrich Thomsen) was a great find in letting him portray the secret that won't go away and will come back to haunt the family, his way of playing this character was riveting, always on the bring of insanity, but on the other in total control of his feelings. The brother Michael (Thomas Bo Larsen) is the obnoxious rascist person who has trouble with just about everybody. He doesn't know anything about this secret and can't believe a word his brother is saying. Sister Helene (Paprika Steen) is the one who doesn't want the secret to come out in order to save the family from its own dark secrets, during the course of the movie she is eating by her own guilt and ultimately gives in to it. Sister Linda (Lene Laub Oksen) is the sister who has committed suicide a year before this story unfolds because of this horrible secret. Certainly the most tragic of all characters was the mother (Birthe Neumann) of all the children, she has known about this all along and doesn't want anybody to know this secret either to protect her husband or in fear of her husband. She has lost a daughter to this secret and has to live constantly on the edge between truth and lies.Certainly not everybody will like this movie as much as I did.

I can't honestly speak for whether the current IMDb credit that he gets is referring to a specific Lovecraft story, but it's clear that Michael DeLuca's script was heavily influenced by the general themes of Lovecraft's work, the blending of fact and fantasy and the doubt of whether there is such a thing as absolute truth and absolute reality.Frankly, In the Mouth of Madness is a super concept and then very little more. It shouldn't be surprising that DeLuca's day job involves running New Line Pictures. This movie is a great pitch and then no real story telling, despite the game efforts of director John Carpenter.Sam Neill plays John Trent, an insurance investigator who always know when people are lying. As the film begins, Trent is already several tacos short of a combination plate. He's been tossed in an asylum and you know that this is a bad asylum because John Glover (generally prone to playing crazy characters himself) is sitting at the front desk. And then, to make matters worse, David Warner (who absurdly is now best known to audiences as one of the heavies in Titanic...) is called in to get his story.Apparently Trent was called in to track down a reclusive mystery writer who disappeared several chapters short of the conclusion of his most recent novel. Trent, of course, is a man you can't fool. You can't mess with his head. And the writer, Sutter Cane, has a reputation for writing books that drive people crazy. So it would be a battle of wills if it weren't so one-sided. Trent is sent off to a small New Hampshire town with Cane's editor (or agent, the distinctions get confusing at a certain point) and as soon as they get to the town they discover that something really bad is brewing. And to say anything more would probably confuse you, me, and anybody planning on seeing the movie.In the Mouth of Madness has a very familiar feel for fans of Carpenter's work. The plot contains elements of Village of the Damned and the special effects look a bit like the nasty creature in The Thing. Everything, however, looks really cheap. The New Hampshire town looks like a two location set. There's a town square and a scary Byzantine church. The actors are all cardboard cutouts, from Neill, who's completely incapable of carrying the film by himself (in fact, including his best Australian films, has he ever been given so much responsibility on screen?) to the completely amateurish Julie Carmen as his travelling companion. The supporting performances by Warner, Glover, Jurgen Prochnow, and Jurgen Prochnow are all just awful. The raises my major question (And the is accompanied by a **MAJOR SPOILER!!!!**)Is the movie supposed to be bad? Or at least tacky in the ways that I've mentioned? As the final scene involves Trent going to see In the Mouth of Madness, can we just assume that in a metatextual sense this movie is cheesy because it's a cheesy adapatation of a cheesy imaginary book? Is the Hobb's End silly looking because it's not even supposed to be a real city? Are the performances bad because the characters are intentionally one dimensional? Is the entire film just supposed to be a bad film within a film? And as such is it just an homage to the classic British science fiction tradition from Lovecraft to Quatermass, etc?I think I may enjoy it more on that level. If there's a kind of multi-layered calculation that restricts quality than maybe it even succeeds for me. If you take the film as an examination of diminished audience returns, than it comments of low brow adapations of good books, etc. The evil force taking over the minds of everybody who reads Cane's books may capture the minds of the intelligent, but the film is supposed to attack people who don't read. It's low brow, then, for the sake of being low brow. And that may be very interesting.Left to its own devices, though, I just found myself remembering how wonderfully scary The Thing, Halloween, and the Fog are. And how Carpenter at his best used to be the master of tightly wound action plots, like Escape from New York and Assault on Precinct 13. I also found myself appreciating Lovecraft's skill even though he's never been a favorite of mine. At least he was always more successful in examining the rips in reality that he depicted.

And to say anything more would probably confuse you, me, and anybody planning on seeing the movie.In the Mouth of Madness has a very familiar feel for fans of Carpenter's work. The plot contains elements of Village of the Damned and the special effects look a bit like the nasty creature in The Thing. Everything, however, looks really cheap. The New Hampshire town looks like a two location set. There's a town square and a scary Byzantine church. The actors are all cardboard cutouts, from Neill, who's completely incapable of carrying the film by himself (in fact, including his best Australian films, has he ever been given so much responsibility on screen?) to the completely amateurish Julie Carmen as his travelling companion. The supporting performances by Warner, Glover, Jurgen Prochnow, and Jurgen Prochnow are all just awful. The raises my major question (And the is accompanied by a **MAJOR SPOILER!!!!**)Is the movie supposed to be bad? Or at least tacky in the ways that I've mentioned? As the final scene involves Trent going to see In the Mouth of Madness, can we just assume that in a metatextual sense this movie is cheesy because it's a cheesy adapatation of a cheesy imaginary book? Is the Hobb's End silly looking because it's not even supposed to be a real city? Are the performances bad because the characters are intentionally one dimensional? Is the entire film just supposed to be a bad film within a film? And as such is it just an homage to the classic British science fiction tradition from Lovecraft to Quatermass, etc?I think I may enjoy it more on that level. If there's a kind of multi-layered calculation that restricts quality than maybe it even succeeds for me. If you take the film as an examination of diminished audience returns, than it comments of low brow adapations of good books, etc. The evil force taking over the minds of everybody who reads Cane's books may capture the minds of the intelligent, but the film is supposed to attack people who don't read. It's low brow, then, for the sake of being low brow. And that may be very interesting.Left to its own devices, though, I just found myself remembering how wonderfully scary The Thing, Halloween, and the Fog are. And how Carpenter at his best used to be the master of tightly wound action plots, like Escape from New York and Assault on Precinct 13. I also found myself appreciating Lovecraft's skill even though he's never been a favorite of mine. At least he was always more successful in examining the rips in reality that he depicted. DeLuca just isn't up to the challenge.Since the movie did make me think and since I also accept the possibility that there is depth here that I'm not fully crediting, I'd give this one a 5\/10. But even that may be a little high.

Gladiator's heroic goodies and hissable baddies are so obvious even Spielberg would have complained.  For the Autobots, we have Russell Crowe.

For the Decepticons, we have Joaquim Phoenix, who killed his own dad, ordered the deaths of Crowe and his family, forces people to fight and die for his entertainment, wants to do his sister, and kicks puppies in the teeth.

It's in these moments, too, that the film's hypocrisy becomes obvious.

We can condemn the audience in the colosseum for enjoying it, while happily stuffing popcorn down our faces and cheering when Crowe stabs another gladiator.

Carry on Cleo had more emotional impact.The ending is as predictable as possible.  Did anyone really think it would end with Phoenix still in power?

Six million people like your mum and your dad, six million of your friends, six million people who had mums and dads and friends of their own.  Life is Beautiful gives us the intimacy that the numbers can't translate, and for the first time, it becomes more than words in a textbook talking dryly about the unimaginable.The first half of the movie lets us see the lives of the three lead characters, before showing us how easily they can be destroyed. Writer\/director Roberto Benigni is immensely charming in the lead role, and it's sad to see him sucked into the predictability of Hollywood.  They loved him in the movie, they laughed at the Oscars, but they'll only ever see him as a novelty item.  Don't expect any lead roles in mainstream American cinema any time soon.  The chemistry between Benigni and real-life wife Nicoletta Braschi holds the movie together, and their son is so adorable that the audience will fight over who loves him the most.  This domestic bliss and light comedy is surrounded by a growing sense of danger, and the appearance of Nazi officers becomes more frequent as the film reaches its midway point.In this atmosphere, there is a wonderful scene where Benigni is waiting at a table in a restaurant.  The guests are talking about a maths problem introduced into German textbooks, which is soaked in anti-Semitic propaganda.  Their lack of concern and interest makes a powerful point with great subtlety that the Third Reich wasn't just one man.  Before the seizure of power, the Nazi party had been immensely popular, and Germany's history of anti-Semitism had begun long before Adolf Hitler rose to prominence.The second half of the movie is where its genius becomes more obvious, but where its historical accuracy becomes more obviously flawed.  Guido (Benigni) and his family are taken to a concentration camp, and the only way he can explain the situation to his son is that it's a surprise for his birthday.  He then turns it into a game, explaining that if they get the most points they will win a tank as first prize.  This made me consider something that hadn't ever crossed my mind.  How did they explain it to the children?  It's impossible even for adults to truly understand the Nazi years, so how can they begin to explain such evil to children?Their concentration camp is bizarrely relaxed and spacious, and Benigni is allowed to walk around fairly freely.  This is where most of the criticism comes from; that it trivialises the experience.  But while it doesn't show the full horror, it shows it on a level that the audience can understand. That Guido retains his imagination and humour has also been criticised, but it's too easy to see every prisoner as a broken spirit.  This shows that resistance can be in the mind, and that it is no less powerful for being hidden.This movie embraces the idea of history from below, that by looking at the experiences of `real people' you can understand the nature of real life within history.  The Nazi years weren't just about torture and book burnings; when the books were seized and burned, how did it affect the reading habits of the German population?  Did they read less often, or read only the books that were left?

When the teacher writes `six million' on the blackboard it's hard to see past the number.  What we weren't taught was that the Holocaust wasn't about numbers, it was about people.  Six million people like your mum and your dad, six million of your friends, six million people who had mums and dads and friends of their own.  Life is Beautiful gives us the intimacy that the numbers can't translate, and for the first time, it becomes more than words in a textbook talking dryly about the unimaginable.The first half of the movie lets us see the lives of the three lead characters, before showing us how easily they can be destroyed. Writer\/director Roberto Benigni is immensely charming in the lead role, and it's sad to see him sucked into the predictability of Hollywood.  They loved him in the movie, they laughed at the Oscars, but they'll only ever see him as a novelty item.  Don't expect any lead roles in mainstream American cinema any time soon.  The chemistry between Benigni and real-life wife Nicoletta Braschi holds the movie together, and their son is so adorable that the audience will fight over who loves him the most.  This domestic bliss and light comedy is surrounded by a growing sense of danger, and the appearance of Nazi officers becomes more frequent as the film reaches its midway point.In this atmosphere, there is a wonderful scene where Benigni is waiting at a table in a restaurant.  The guests are talking about a maths problem introduced into German textbooks, which is soaked in anti-Semitic propaganda.  Their lack of concern and interest makes a powerful point with great subtlety that the Third Reich wasn't just one man.  Before the seizure of power, the Nazi party had been immensely popular, and Germany's history of anti-Semitism had begun long before Adolf Hitler rose to prominence.The second half of the movie is where its genius becomes more obvious, but where its historical accuracy becomes more obviously flawed.  Guido (Benigni) and his family are taken to a concentration camp, and the only way he can explain the situation to his son is that it's a surprise for his birthday.  He then turns it into a game, explaining that if they get the most points they will win a tank as first prize.  This made me consider something that hadn't ever crossed my mind.  How did they explain it to the children?  It's impossible even for adults to truly understand the Nazi years, so how can they begin to explain such evil to children?Their concentration camp is bizarrely relaxed and spacious, and Benigni is allowed to walk around fairly freely.  This is where most of the criticism comes from; that it trivialises the experience.  But while it doesn't show the full horror, it shows it on a level that the audience can understand. That Guido retains his imagination and humour has also been criticised, but it's too easy to see every prisoner as a broken spirit.  This shows that resistance can be in the mind, and that it is no less powerful for being hidden.This movie embraces the idea of history from below, that by looking at the experiences of `real people' you can understand the nature of real life within history.  The Nazi years weren't just about torture and book burnings; when the books were seized and burned, how did it affect the reading habits of the German population?  Did they read less often, or read only the books that were left?  This idea is the key to Life is Beautiful, and you can forgive it its inaccuracies for giving us a personal experience that can then be generalised.The ending is truly heartbreaking, and finally `six million' makes sense. Guido, his wife, and their son, were just three people, but we now understand that there were six million more just like them, who were all braver than we will ever need to be.

If you've ever seen No Cure For Cancer or Lock 'N Load, then you'll appreciate the humor coming from Denis in this movie. Sure there are more than the fare share of one-liners but Denis' character's ability to not go insane amidst the most dysfunctional family in history is hilarious. Kevin Spacey also gives us a preview of why he was so good in American Beauty. If you ever feel blue around Christmas time, just pop this movie in and you'll realize that you're family isn't so bad.

It surprised me of how much this movie pulled me into the story right from the beginning and kept my attention all the way to the end. But most importantly, it features a powerful, knockout performance by Julia Roberts in the title role. Oscar voters if you are reading this take note immediately Roberts deserves to be nominated for Best Actress and deserves to win. This is probably the best work she's ever done. Roberts dominates this film by appearing in almost every scene. Erin Brockovich is a tough-as-nails mother of three who goes to work for a law firm run by an attorney (wonderfully played by Albert Finney) who represented her in a case at the beginning of the movie. She eventually stumbles upon a monumental law case against a giant corporation (PG&E). Erin decides to take on this company at any cost. She also gets plenty of help from her boss, and the two begin a memorable fight that ends up bringing a small town to its feet and a huge corporation to its knees. Erin Brockovich not only has a great performance by Roberts, but an excellent supporting performance by Finney as her boss, who early on hilariously tells his new employee about rethinking her wardrobe (love those outfits she wears). He should get an Oscar nomination too. Oscar nominations should also go to director Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter Susannah Grant for bringing this movie to life and telling a compelling story (Soderbergh will definitely get a Best Director nomination but he'll probably be nominated for his current movie Traffic, which is also generating Oscar talk). There are a couple of moments in Erin Brockovich that I could have done without, and if the movie had been about 15-20 minutes shorter, it would have been a great movie. Nevertheless, it comes close, and Roberts splendid acting here is the driving force behind the success of this movie. If she doesn't take home the Best Actress Oscar come this March and the award ends up going to someone else, I'm going to be very upset. SHE DESERVES IT!!!!! As for the rest of Erin Brockovich, right from its smashing opening to its hilarious conclusion, it's a pretty darn good movie.***1\/2 (out of four)  ","genre":null},{"date":"22 December 2000","score":"","review":"  Erin Brockovich was a surprise to me.
