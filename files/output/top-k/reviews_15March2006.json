[{"date":"15 March 2006","score":"","review":" Every few years, it seems, a film comes out detailing the exploits of a menage a trois. Summer Lovers, Threesome, Three to Tango are a few examples. By this time, there isn't a whole lot new that can be added to the mix, though this film tries hard to be lively, edgy, funny and compelling. Robertson plays a young, struggling actress in L.A. who's in the midst of a sexual dry spell. Amazingly, in one night, she falls for two guys. One, Schaech, is a bookish, sensitive type while the other, Keeslar, is a wild, tattooed drummer in a band. She attempts to juggle the men and decide which one she truly wants to pursue, but eventually decides that she can't decide. Tentatively, she explains to each one of them that she has feelings for both of them. One night, with the help of several bottles of booze, they discover that they can actually function as a threesome, eventually living together. Unfortunately, things eventually get out of hand as Robertson begins to doubt the practicality of the situation and wonders if she can really have a life with these men. In walks film director Mabius who seems to fulfill every need she's ever had, except she doesn't feel for him the spark that she did with the other guys. Meanwhile, her funky artist friend MacDonald supplies commentary and support from the sidelines. Robertson, looking very lovely here, gives as good a performance as anyone could of such a self-indulgent, rather reckless person. She narrates the film in flashback with several in-your-face close-ups, speaking in that Gen-X way that can annoy some older viewers. Still, she's good in the film and manages, most of the time, to retain the audience's sympathy. Schaech, who smokes incessantly throughout, is attractive (despite some pronounced dark circles under his eyes) and reasonably appealing. Keeslar is, at first glance, a dumb lug, but his appeal grows throughout the film and he winds up as one of the most lovable characters. He's handsome and sexy. MacDonald enjoys her sassy role and has quite a few sarcastic and funny lines. Mabius is very likable, perhaps too likable to make this story really work since it's hard to see why he isn't good enough for Robertson. He gives an amiable, gentle, memorable performance which goes fairly unrewarded in the film. This is a revved up, colorful, splashy rendition of the old threesome genre that is often sexy and rarely boring. It looks great and has some nice acting in it. Unfortunately, it never seems particularly real and the ending is less satisfying than it would like to be (not to mention clichéd.) Additionally, two characters who claim to have gone through great change actually haven't changed at all since they barely could pull it together to even present themselves at the climax. The story is pretty much paint by numbers and it's up to the actors to fill it in and try to make it all work. It only does so marginally. Still, it's an arresting and intriguing movie with more than a few memorable sequences.

I just found another of my favorite movies of all time and this one has been hiding on me since 1995...11 freaking years!! I finally got around to watching Get Shorty and didn't stop watching it until it was done and over with and then I wanted to watch it again!! Get Shorty reminds me of Ocean's 11 in the way that it brings together some Hollywood elite for a good time and better yet an amazing story and interesting film. I have yet to see the sequel but now I absolutely cannot wait another minute to see it!! John Travolta plays one of the greatest characters in film history...Chili Palmer. A loan shark\/gangster who ends up in Hollywood while on a collection run for his new boss who he hates. Taken in by the Hollywood glam Chili meets up with a starlet and a down on his luck director in order to bring his own personal idea to the big screen. Travolta's tough guy is the best of the best...hey, hey look at me goes down in my books along with You talking to me? and I'll make you an offer you can't refuse. Travolta plays the greatest anti hero, he's mean and a bad ass and yet you love the guy and root for him. He's smart too and always outsmarts his adversaries and he has a few!! Enter the amazing Gene Hackman as the director Harry Zimm. Harry has the worst luck and it gets worse when Chili Palmer enters his life. Hackman is terrific and it's not often you see him getting beaten up, shot at, stepped on and it makes for some funny moments. Hackman should have gotten award nominations as should have Travolta. Rene Russo does what she does best...support. She's a support actor and she does well doing that. She has had scenes with more top leading men than any other actress in Hollywood and she's glamorous and does a good job. Her character Karen Flores is a little empty, there isn't a lot to it but she certainly plays her part. Danny Devito is Hollywood legend, two time Academy Award winning actor Martin Weir. Part of the sarcastic comedy is the idea of this little man being such a huge Hollywood player. His self involved, womanizing Weir is wonderful and fun to watch. Devito impresses!! Dennis Farina plays Ray Bones Barboni. I've always considered Farina as more of a TV actor, he never really opens himself up to greatness but he is pretty good up against Travolta as his nemesis and new boss. He's violent and cruel and he's stupid and Travolta gets the better of him every time. He adds to this cast for sure!! Delroy Lindo is even better as the maniacal Hollywood mobster Bo Catlett. Lindo would have made an even better villain if it was just him. The story is pretty complex and intense and has so much going on so his true acting brilliance as Bo Catlett gets buried a little but it's still great. Finally Mr. Soprano himself James Gandolfini is Bo's henchman and former Hollywood stuntman Bear. Nobody plays the tough guy better but he plays his own tough guy role to a bit of poking fun as he gets beaten by Travolta badly every time until finally he ends up on his side. Gandolfini is a great villain, always has been (check out the brilliant The Last Castle) but he's even better as a brooding sidekick.Director Barry Sonnenfeld is no stranger to comedy but most of his comedies before this and since this have been pretty juvenile. This is without a doubt his best work and probably always will be. Get Short is the exact definition of black comedy. It's funny but in a weird, twisted way and it's satirical and really pokes fun at Hollywood and stereotypes in general. The story moves so quickly and there is so much going on and so many characters but you never lose grip on any one of them and all the stories are intertwined perfectly and at the heart of it all you have the amazing Chili Palmer who Travolta embraces and creates as his own. It's a Hollywood film, heist film, comedy, gangster, buddy film, romance...you name it...it's everything and it's now probably one of my top ten favorite films of all time. Why did I wait so long??

While at a local zoo, spying on her Son Lionel & Piquita, Vera is bitten by a vicious Rat-Monkey. The bite becomes infected & despite the best efforts of Nurse McTavish (Brenda Kendall) Vera dies the following day, however she doesn't stay dead for long as she comes back as a flesh-eating zombie. Nurse McTavish is her first victim & she too rises from the dead, Lionel manages to lock them in his cellar & keep them sedated with tranquilisers. In a series of incidents that follow things spiral out of control, a mutant baby is born & more zombies are created as there seems to be no end to the bloodshed. To add to his problems Lionel's Uncle Les (Ian Watkin) turns up trying to get his hands on the Cosgrove fortune, is Lionel's relationship with Piquita doomed to failure? Will anyone discovers the horrors in Lionel's basement? It's well worth watching to find out...This New Zealand production was co-written & directed by Peter Jackson while he was still working outside the big budget Hollywood machine, he has gone on to make the Lord of the Rings Trilogy (2001 - 2003) & more recently the mega budget King Kong (2005) remake, he also has a small role in the film as the undertaker's assistant. According to the IMDb there are a few different versions of Braindead floating around with as much as 20 odd minutes difference between them, the version I will be commenting on is the full uncut 100 plus minute version that has been released in the UK containing all the gore. Now, what on Earth can I say about Braindead that hasn't already been said? Well nothing probably but in my opinion this has the the absolute finest, most brilliant, simply wonderful & just downright fantastic horror comedy ever, it's as simple & straight forward as that. The script by Jackson, Stephen Sinclair & Fran Walsh (who appears in the film credited as 'Mother at Park') has the absolute perfect combination of horror, gross out gore & comedy as it uses all three to wonderful effect throughout the entire film. I love all the over-the-top character's, from the hilarious Uncle Les to the tactless Mr. Matheson (Lewis Rowe), from the bizarre kung-fu fighting Father McGruder (Stuart Devenie) to the likable Piquita & Lionel whom I really started to feel for & the dodgy German veterinarian! The whole thing is brilliantly judged, is totally hilarious & just so entertaining. I love this film, it's as simple & straight forward as that.Director Jackson shows why he now virtually has a blank cheque from any major Hollywood studio to play with, Braindead is almost perfection in my mind. The way it's shot, the character's, the gore, the imagination & the thing moves along like a rocket. The only negatives things I can say about it is that I didn't like the ending that much & I thought the silly looking giant deformed monster spoiled things a bit. There are major continuity errors at the end, despite being covered in gallons of blood & guts at the very end when Lionel & Piquita are in the street their clothes show almost no sign of blood stains at all! While the amount of blood & gore in Braindead is highly commendable there is so much of it in quick succession that you feel slightly bombarded by it & don't have enough time to take it all in but that's a small criticism. I have seen a lot of horror films & I personally think that Braindead probably is the goriest I've seen, the sheer amount of blood spurting, severed limbs, impalings, lawnmower chopping action, flesh ripping & just general carnage is joyous to behold & is surely as extreme as any other film out there.With a budget of about $3,000,000 Braindead is very well made with some terrific special effects that will freak your girlfriend out. I'm currently thinking about a friend at work named Kelly, if I showed her this film I don't think she'd ever speak to me again! The acting is very good, Watkins as Uncle Les is just hilarious in every scene he's in. Apparently Braindead won best film, best director, best screenplay & best male dramatic performance at the prestigious 1993 New Zealand Film & TV Awards which upset a few people...Braindead is easily one of my favourite films ever & probably is my favourite horror comedy, I just think it's near perfection & as a film it contains everything I want & more besides. Although having said that it won't be the same for everyone. This is a film I could talk about all day & run out of superlatives to describe it but when all said & done I adore this film as much as any other I've ever seen.

I love all the over-the-top character's, from the hilarious Uncle Les to the tactless Mr. Matheson (Lewis Rowe), from the bizarre kung-fu fighting Father McGruder (Stuart Devenie) to the likable Piquita & Lionel whom I really started to feel for & the dodgy German veterinarian! The whole thing is brilliantly judged, is totally hilarious & just so entertaining. I love this film, it's as simple & straight forward as that.Director Jackson shows why he now virtually has a blank cheque from any major Hollywood studio to play with, Braindead is almost perfection in my mind. The way it's shot, the character's, the gore, the imagination & the thing moves along like a rocket. The only negatives things I can say about it is that I didn't like the ending that much & I thought the silly looking giant deformed monster spoiled things a bit. There are major continuity errors at the end, despite being covered in gallons of blood & guts at the very end when Lionel & Piquita are in the street their clothes show almost no sign of blood stains at all! While the amount of blood & gore in Braindead is highly commendable there is so much of it in quick succession that you feel slightly bombarded by it & don't have enough time to take it all in but that's a small criticism. I have seen a lot of horror films & I personally think that Braindead probably is the goriest I've seen, the sheer amount of blood spurting, severed limbs, impalings, lawnmower chopping action, flesh ripping & just general carnage is joyous to behold & is surely as extreme as any other film out there.With a budget of about $3,000,000 Braindead is very well made with some terrific special effects that will freak your girlfriend out. I'm currently thinking about a friend at work named Kelly, if I showed her this film I don't think she'd ever speak to me again! The acting is very good, Watkins as Uncle Les is just hilarious in every scene he's in. Apparently Braindead won best film, best director, best screenplay & best male dramatic performance at the prestigious 1993 New Zealand Film & TV Awards which upset a few people...Braindead is easily one of my favourite films ever & probably is my favourite horror comedy, I just think it's near perfection & as a film it contains everything I want & more besides. Although having said that it won't be the same for everyone. This is a film I could talk about all day & run out of superlatives to describe it but when all said & done I adore this film as much as any other I've ever seen.

You may have seen some of Cuaron's other work (e.g. remake of Great Expectations w\/Hawke and Paltrowich), but unlikely that you've seen him like this. The story's formula is not an unfamiliar one a coming-of-age episode involving two male friends, each of whom hankers for the same femme fatale (many have thus rightly compared it to Truffaut's classic, Jules et Jim). Julio and Tenoch (Gael Garcia Bernal & Diego Luna, respectively) are two Mexican upper-middle class teens and longstanding friends, as evinced by their getting high, reluctantly attending school and incessantly engaging in frank discussions about their sexual fantasies-cum-encounters (which become all the franker as the film progresses). They both have girlfriends, conveniently away on holiday to Italy, leaving the boys by themselves, but fret not, they've promised to behave and remain true! The leading lady in this foreign gem that you shamelessly balked at seeing because it involved reading subtitles, is as comely as can be, HOT in the most classy while still curvaceous of meanings (the former proved by the first scene in which we meet Luica (the delicious Maribel Verdu, who the non-troglodytes amongst ye might remember as the loveliest of the beguiling sisters in Trueba's Belle Epoque) in a formal cocktail dress, the latter proved no less indisputably by the balance of the film); consider also that her character is a woman ten years older than the two other protagonists and thus emblematic of an older, female teacher upon whom her younger male students bear great crushes. The film's replete with great local flavor, stellar vistas and beach scenery juxtaposed with unmistakable poverty, assorted Mexican pop and varied American fixtures, as well as an enrapturing leitmotif, further buttressed by Cuaron's use of stedi-cam shots, close-ups and practically lyrical lab dissolves. This ineluctably intoxicating film deals with sex in an up-front and explicit manner, quite unlike the way the Hollywood studios would dare depict it--Hollywood could never have made this movie, just another reason for you to see it. The film even informs the viewer of the unabashed means by which it intends to address the topic of sex, lust and passion by a sort of visceral, visual confrontational opening scene, with the camera espying two people (Julio and his girlfriend) having sex while promising their hearts to one another\/none other. Louisa's character is Spanish but we find her in sunny Mexico courtesy of her marriage to Tenoch's pompous author cousin. Tenoch & Julio encounter Louisa at a wedding reception, where they hit on her for the fun of it and in an effort to irk her husband, a character the audience will immediately dismiss, and whom we will later learn we were well warranted to so hastily dislike. She responds with amusement, seemingly flattered and they talk of taking a trip to an Edenic beach, called Heaven's Mouth, in the north of the country, a fictive, extemporaneous creation of Tenoch and Julio's, described in increasing detail on the heels of each other's mendacious leads (a scenario I certainly found familiar), with the boys finally asking her to join them. A few days later, after an emotional crisis I dare not divulge, she shocks them by accepting their offer to go to the paradise that doesn't even exist, so they must borrow a car and think of somewhere that might vaguely resemble such a locale. This journey becomes the crux of the film; an odyssey of self-discovery I found most conscripting. Much as Truffaut did in the aforementioned Jules and Jim and, more recently, as Jean-Pierre Juenet (Delicatessen, City of Lost Children) does in Amelie, Cuaron employs an almost surreal, stoic narrator who periodically works on our auricular senses to complement and\/or counteract the otherwise heavily\/visually vibrant emotional aspects of the film. Every once in a while, the film goes silent in an almost hypnotizing way, whereupon the narrator tells us a character?s back story, some random thought or a piece of Mexico's history; one such moment comes when the narrator tells us of the horrors our heroes would have seen had they happened to have driven down this particular stretch of road five years prior, an odd fact that soon turns out to be profoundly more relevant than was immediately apparent. The journey that the boys end up taking with Luica is enlightening to say the least and, as for the film as a whole, I can say nothing more pithy and poignant than add it to your queue!

Hell, even his wife (Diane Keaton) doesn't feel safe next to him anymore.As we witness Michael's dealings with power, corruption and murder, we're also given the chance to see what gave birth to the Corleone dynasty in the first place. We learn, through flashbacks, that a boy named Vito Andolini had to escape from his native Sicily when his father was brutally assassinated. Once at Ellis Island, his home-town was mistaken for his surname. From that day on, he would be known as Vito Corleone. Yes, it's the same Vito Corleone who made offers you can't refuse in the first movie, and this time we're shown how he slowly became a feared gangster in his younger years. It's a riveting look at yesterday's society, which doesn't differ that much from ours power is still as easy to obtain as it is to lose forever, and no matter how sophisticated man's methods can get, violence is still the best way to achieve something under specific circumstances.Just like Part I, this impeccable, superior sequel is masterfully staged by the filmmakers, their passion for the material breaking out of every single frame.

It's one of those rare times people don't complain about the fact that a thespian was replaced in a sequel (okay, so Marlon Brando wouldn't have looked young enough for the part, but otherwise he would have been perfect) De Niro's star-making turn has the power of not making you miss the older Don for the entire movie. It's a top notch performance based on gestures and looks rather than words (but then again, he only speaks Sicilian throughout the film), which would become De Niro's trademark and which he proved to master perfectly long before Travis Bickle, Jake La Motta and Jimmy Conway made their appearance.Before The Godfather Part II was released, all sequels were considered B-movies.

Shawshank I must say is a rather enjoyable watch with a decent performance from Tim Robbins, a particular good one from Morgan Freeman, a decent storyline and a nice ending. However that said I would not put it anywhere near my top 50 movies list and I'm pretty sure I could name at least 30 films, twenty of which are not even ranked in the 250 that are IMO way better than Shawshank in their use of story telling and making you study them in your head even after you've watched them many times. It would perhaps be safe to say that what ever it does for many other people it just didn't do for me.

He manages to find it but gets it taken off him by rival archaeologist, Belloq. Indy returns to America where he works at a univeristy. He gets informed that the Nazis are searching for the Ark of the Covenant in Cairo. Even worse, the Nazis are lead by Belloq. He is sent to Cairo with the help from allie, Sallah and the beautiful Marion Ravenwood to recover the lost ark before Belloq can take something away from Indy again.THE GOOD Raiders of the Lost Ark is perfect in every way possible. First I'll start with the acting and characters. Harrison Ford was perfect for the role of Indiana Jones. The movie would've sucked if Tom Selleck got the part. Karen Allen was great and good-looking as Marion Ravenwood. Paul Freeman was also good as the main villain, Belloq. John Rhys-Davies was also great as Sallah. Danny Devito would've been too comical.The screenplay was great as well. The love scenes are far from cheesy. I rather liked the scene where Indy tells Marion to kiss ever part of his body that doesn't hurt, and they end up kissing each other on the lips. Indy's smart comments were great as well, especially Didn't you guys ever go to Sunday School? When the dialogue tries to take itself seriously, it does.The action probably the best thing about this movie. From the famous boulder scene in the beginning, to the truck chase in the Cairo desert, you'll be on the edge of your seat the whole time. And who could forget the scene where Indy runs into the swordsman, and shoots him! Classic! The special effects were great as well, especially as there wasn't any CGI back then. The fibreglass boulder at the beginning looks like sheer stone. Most of the snakes in the Well of Souls sequence were hoses but you could not tell. The explosions were real, and there are a lot of them in the Indy vs Large Mechanic fight as they fight under a plane as Marion shoots things with the planes turret. Finally the scene where the ark gets opened is one of the greatest scenes ever filmed with horrifying effects that will make cower in terror(I mean scary, not bad).THE BAD You must be joking!

Example (from memory, mind you) Hey, you were going to be a lawyer like your dad, weren't you? But you let him down, right? This guy is too smart to be here! The only interesting characters are Phil and Gordon and even their stories are dumbed down by an ending meant to thrill and shock! because every movie these days needs a surprise ending.The pacing in this movie could've led to a good movie. Everything feels as if it's leading up to something better. People say these thrills are psychological despite the fact that there are no real scares that haven't been committed to film before. A guy walking in a hall in the dark being scared by a figure that the guy later thinks are birds is not original at all.

It will be, at the very least, a revelation, and at its spellbinding apex, a validation of what die-hard fans knew about him all along...that Griffith had deeply ingrained reserves of acting talent that were rarely ever mined properly.But Kazan knew it, and struck gold by casting him as the country-bumpkin sage, 'Lonesome' Rhodes.

All Quiet on the Western Front won a deserved Best Picture Academy Award in the year it came out and brought great prestige to Universal Pictures as the first Oscar in that category won by that studio.Lew Ayres is the student leader of a bunch of German school boys in 1914 who listen to the voice of their school master and enlist in the war that's just been declared. The whole class enlists and that's not hyperbole because in Germany at the time it was the boys who got the education and the girls if they got it, got it separately from the boys. I'm sure that viewers of All Quiet on the Western Front today probably are asking why that school master and so many of his generation were urging their youth on to such folly. Very simply that their generation had a quick victory in 1870 in the Franco-Prussian War. Every generation since wars were recorded figures their war experience will be the same for their children.Only it wasn't. On the western front the Allied and Central Powers armies were locked in a bitter stalemate that ran diagonally across France and Belgium from the English Channel to the Swiss border. This went on for a little over four years. In fact had it not been for the fact that America joined the Allied side and the French and British held out until they did, I'm sure an honest armistice would have been declared long before November 11, 1918.You lived, fought and died in those trenches. Either you were defending or you were attacking the other guy's trenches against murderous automatic weapon fire and long distance artillery batteries. All Quiet on the Western Front was the first great war film of the American sound era and graphically shows that.And it shows that from the enemy perspective. That's something today's audience can't appreciate, the fact that the film was from the Wilhelmine German perspective. Remember these were the enemy a dozen years before. But the experience in the trenches was universal.Lew Ayres became a star with this film and it effected him so deeply that he became a committed pacifist which caused later problems in his career. He's the voice of reason and civilization and the voice of a lost generation of Germans who would never have listened to the demagogic appeals of the Nazis. Louis Wolheim plays the veteran soldier who befriends Ayres and his school boy chums and teaches them how to survive in the trenches. It turned out to be his greatest role. He was a brutish looking man and played mostly those types in silent films. All Quiet on the Western Front would have been the start of a whole new career opening. But Wolheim died the following year just as he was to start filming The Front Page. Adolphe Menjou took the part of Walter Burns in that film which Wolheim was to have.The third really stand out performance is that of John Wray who some might remember as the brutal prison guard in Each Dawn I Die. Wray plays an officious mail man who is in the German Army Reserve. He gets called up and this little nobody gets rather impressed with himself and his new found authority as a training sergeant to Ayres and his friends.

All Quiet on the Western Front won a deserved Best Picture Academy Award in the year it came out and brought great prestige to Universal Pictures as the first Oscar in that category won by that studio.Lew Ayres is the student leader of a bunch of German school boys in 1914 who listen to the voice of their school master and enlist in the war that's just been declared. The whole class enlists and that's not hyperbole because in Germany at the time it was the boys who got the education and the girls if they got it, got it separately from the boys. I'm sure that viewers of All Quiet on the Western Front today probably are asking why that school master and so many of his generation were urging their youth on to such folly. Very simply that their generation had a quick victory in 1870 in the Franco-Prussian War. Every generation since wars were recorded figures their war experience will be the same for their children.Only it wasn't. On the western front the Allied and Central Powers armies were locked in a bitter stalemate that ran diagonally across France and Belgium from the English Channel to the Swiss border. This went on for a little over four years. In fact had it not been for the fact that America joined the Allied side and the French and British held out until they did, I'm sure an honest armistice would have been declared long before November 11, 1918.You lived, fought and died in those trenches. Either you were defending or you were attacking the other guy's trenches against murderous automatic weapon fire and long distance artillery batteries. All Quiet on the Western Front was the first great war film of the American sound era and graphically shows that.And it shows that from the enemy perspective. That's something today's audience can't appreciate, the fact that the film was from the Wilhelmine German perspective. Remember these were the enemy a dozen years before. But the experience in the trenches was universal.Lew Ayres became a star with this film and it effected him so deeply that he became a committed pacifist which caused later problems in his career. He's the voice of reason and civilization and the voice of a lost generation of Germans who would never have listened to the demagogic appeals of the Nazis. Louis Wolheim plays the veteran soldier who befriends Ayres and his school boy chums and teaches them how to survive in the trenches. It turned out to be his greatest role. He was a brutish looking man and played mostly those types in silent films. All Quiet on the Western Front would have been the start of a whole new career opening. But Wolheim died the following year just as he was to start filming The Front Page. Adolphe Menjou took the part of Walter Burns in that film which Wolheim was to have.The third really stand out performance is that of John Wray who some might remember as the brutal prison guard in Each Dawn I Die.

I'm now 37 and have made it an annual tradition to watch this movie every Independence Day.The actors portrayed America's founding fathers with humanity and honesty - not stuffy and mythologically. We see the real fear and real hopes of real men. We see the grief and hardship of the wives who must bear the burden of loneliness and chastity during the long terms that their husbands are off in Philadelphia to represent their colonies to the Continental Congress. The lyrics of the love songs sung between John Adams and his blessed wife, Abigail, are not fictional tripe, but are real words gleaned from actual letters sent between the two.What tips the scale in favor of this movie is the carefully placed humor, without which this movie would surely have failed as being too boring for modern viewers. But the humor is not tasteless or pointless jokes. Ben Franklin, the biggest jokemeister of them all, uses his humor to slam dunk logical and rational points which make the audience really think about what liberty is.The music in this movie is delightful - and even bearable for today's non-musical theater crowd. The songs tell stories, and the songs themselves make the viewer feel that it is a release of tension for the characters.While the story itself contains several minor historical errors (for example, Judge Wilson of Pennsylvania was not the person to cast the tie-breaking vote for independence), the literary license taken by 1776's authors is totally forgivable because they brought the past to life for us and made real that which was truly important. Anyone who sees this film will have a new found respect for the men who established this nation - from Congress to General Washington to the poor soldiers on the battlefield to their extended families and to the people of the Colonies themselves, without whose determination there would be no Sovereign American United States.Now, if only the President of the United States would watch this film...

At no point of time during the film did I believe that these characters would do what they ultimately would for these peasants were it not written down on a piece of paper.Yul Brenner, while a great King of Siam, is perhaps the worst cowboy ever to don a stetson. He's as stiff on the screen as the leather on his saddle. While some see this as stoicism, I interpret it as skin-deep acting. The rest of the seven protagonists aside from perhaps Charles Bronson are given no personal history at all, so you're not even quite sure what kind of qualities these particular gunmen bring to the table. James Coburn's character is a mere shadow of his Japanese counterpart, the only thing we ever come to know about him is that he throws a knife well and he dies without ever doing anything really significant or awe-inspiring.All-in-all, I would say that this was a poor adaptation of a marvelously nuanced original story that not necessarily can't be duplicated, nor would I say that the characters and themes do not translate well. What I would say is that this version is a mere husk of what it could have, and when one considers the immense talent involved, SHOULD have been in every imaginable way.

Apparently, its story is based on the old 1957 classic, An Affair to Remember (starring Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr), which I confess to not having seen.The story revolves around a recent Seattle widower named Sam, whose son Jonah, seeing his dad's loneliness, advertises via talk show radio for a new wife for him (and mother for himself). Sam receives lots of letters in reply, including one from a certain Annie in Baltimore, despite the fact that she's already engaged to that strange character, Walter. Annie is so attracted and intrigued that she in fact travels to Seattle to check Sam (and his son) out, and so on... and so forth... culminating in a real humdinger of a finale involving NYC's Empire State Building.The lead roles are done to perfection with Tom Hanks (always so natural in every film) portraying the sympathetic, lonely widower, Sam, and Meg Ryan (queen of the romantic comedy) sparkling as the sweet, innocent, and wholesome Annie. I love both these stars anyway and they have great chemistry here. Okay, maybe it's not rocket science, maybe it's corny and unlikely, but it's a really cute movie.

Every character in the movie is brought alive by the actor playing him\/her and it's just so entertaining. We did it as a stage play last winter and I was Professor Plum, so this movie has good and sentimental memories and thoughts for me. It also makes me laugh my ass off. )Every single person I know who has seen 'Clue' loves it! I think it's got something to do with the fact that Tim Curry has all those quick lines at the end and how perverted Plum is throughout with all the women, including Mrs. Peacock at one point! This is one of the best films I have ever seen. Great fun and great laughs. You could quote this movie FOREVER!!

If your one for the soopy films then this film will be the film for you it doesn't have a lot of action its more the film you would sit down with your girlfriends or even your boyfriend. With a cup of coffee i watched this film once on Christmas eve and for 2 years me and my mum were trying to find it but we counldn't remember the tite of it (which didn't help.)I have had this film for about 3 weeks now and i watch it with my mum every Sunday with a box of tissues not far from use. Its really a family film that you watch with your kids its more something you watch by yourself or with some friends its about 88 minutes long and its worth watching it all when you start watching you won't want to turn it off i promise you.
