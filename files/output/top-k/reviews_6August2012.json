This is the kind of picture that, when it's done, you want to immediately rewatch it because you know there are things that you missed.Our story concerns a disillusioned knight named Antonius Block (Max von Sydow, who gives one of cinema's finest performances) and his squire Jöns (Gunnar Björnstrand), who return home after fighting in the Crusades on an empty, desolate beach. Sweden has been victim to the plague, meaning those that have it are dying right before people's eyes, and those who don't have it are engulfed in fear. It isn't long before Block encounters the personified Death (Bengt Ekerot), who appears pale - in a black cloak - much like early, vague illustrations of the Grim Reaper character. Immediately, Block, confused about life and death itself, challenges Death to a game of chess, where if he wins, he will be spared his life.Block and Jöns, en route back to their castle, encounter Jof and his wife Mia, with their infant son, Mikael, who are stage actors in a play. From here on out, the film takes us on an unforgettable ride, as we follow both Block and Jöns's journeys throughout the middle age time period and what unfolds than is a rousing commentary on religion, life, and death.The film has the look of a period piece, but with the contents of serene drama and utter bleakness with the nice surprising inclusion of black comedy. The Seventh Seal too asks existential questions about the world around us in a manner that isn't indulgent, and offers many assumptions in its underlying text. Frequently, we see our character, Block, as hopeless and seemingly unimportant in life. He questions religion so much, and with all the mentions of death (even the appearance) we begin to wonder if he is inherently godless or atheistic in his personality.Often, the film provides us with tonal inconsistency, but it has to be the smoothest tonal inconsistency I have yet to experience. It isn't abrupt, and Bergman successfully manages to hold onto the flow of the story, never becoming too tied up with one of the underlying contexts over the other, and is fair and balanced in his work, including much of his dialog which is not cloyingly absent or annoyingly expository. It is perfectly handled and structured with elegance and purity.The Seventh Seal is one of the strongest foreign works of all time, and a film with enough on its plate to develop three or four movies. Ingmar Bergman's sharp director, distinct and graphic writing style, complimented by the cinematography of the great Gunnar Fischer bring the energy, sophistication, and true delight that is The Seventh Seal. And even with all of these heavy topics at hand, never is it depressingly grim or overly optimistic.Starring Max von Sydow, Gunnar Björnstrand, Bengt Ekerot, and Nils Poppe.

With detective, murderer, motive, method and all the red herrings stripped from the source, what remains is a handful of character names, a car, and a new film built of this basis -- an enchanting romantic chase comedy.The shadow of the gallows is, wisely, all but omitted during this pursuit what counts is the sparring between the two young protagonists, the conflict between the heroine's growing convictions and her family loyalty, and the comic relief that undercuts the tension. The bumbling police have a habit of heading straight for the heroes' secret hideaway when an express train roars down on an oncoming car, it is played for comedy, not gasps. And when the girl escapes seemingly certain death, she promptly runs back for her pet dog -- and gets caught.The real achievement of this picture is its winning charm. All too often I find myself resenting the perceived manipulation of romantic comedies, particularly the hackneyed 'they love each other because they hate each other' variety. But here, with the drama of the chase substituted for the required 'will they\/won't they' structure, Erica's headstrong loyalties blossom unchecked towards one so good-looking and so ill-used (as Tey's sardonic Inspector Grant would gently observe).Theirs is an unusually equal screen partnership, with Erica taking the lead in scenes up to and including the finale while Robert must perforce keep a low profile; yet we see her co-conspirator also mature from the callow, protesting boy of the opening scenes through flippant youth to the protective and resourceful companion who is ultimately prepared to sacrifice himself rather than destroy her life in a hopeless cause. Nova Pilbeam and Derrick de Marney are both outstanding in their portrayal of the young pair in comedy and in romance, and they make a delightful couple in whom one can believe wholeheartedly.Notable also is Mary Clare in a small but memorable part as Erica's Aunt Margaret, in whom the family detective instinct clearly runs strong, with a brief appearance from Basil Radford playing 'Uncle Basil' as a well-intentioned ally. Comedian Jerry Verno has a largely 'straight' scene as a lorry driver who provides Erica with a clue (and here, as in moments elsewhere, the repartee is actually lifted directly from the schoolgirl book-Erica). Percy Marmont makes an impression as Erica's father, caught between a wayward daughter and an unsolved murder.The actual crime and its victim take a relative background position in this story, with the opening scenes -- with their melodrama, consciously arty camera cutaways, and stilted performances -- being the weakest. All investigations lead nowhere, and ultimately the only way to clear the hero's name is for the totally unsuspected villain to confess. This is cleverly managed via a series of coincidences that ratchet up the tension, but even then only a fluke prevents his getting away with it as the protagonists exit baffled a detective story this isn't! (And it's never explained what earthly motive -- or opportunity -- this man had to steal the coat in the first place...) It does, however, provide the excuse for a mesmerising sequence featuring the hotel band, whose personnel are normally as ubiquitous as invisible as the milkman in The Thirty-Nine Steps, and a song especially written for the purpose by Lerner, Goodhart and Hoffmann, who were responsible for a number of film hits in the 1930s.This is an unpretentious and entertaining picture that wears its heart lightly on its sleeve and handles occasional moments both of emotion and of tension with a deft touch.

Yes it is factually inaccurate in some places, the CGI could do with a little brushing up and the acting could be refined slightly, but other than that, there is nothing to say this film is that bad to watch. It's pretty much just a turn off film for a rainy Saturday night and basically I have no real problems with that, just as long as it's not obnoxiously unenjoyable like other films of this calibre.The film begins showing reels of the Atomic bomb tests on the Bikini Atoll in the Pacific, and focuses specifically on the lizards that inhabit the island. The scene then cuts to a Japanese Cargo Ship, which is suddenly attacked by a large underwater creature with the loss of all but 1 of the crew. We then move to the evacuated Chernobyl, where our lead character Niko Tatopoulos is carrying out tests to see the influence of radiation on the genetics of earthworms in the area. But suddenly he is called in by the US Military to examine a large set of footprints that are spread across the Panama countryside. Meanwhile, the last surviving member of the stricken Cargo ship is asked questions by a mysterious French man played by Jean Reno, the only answer he is given is the chilling name of 'Godzilla'. The trail of the large footprints eventually leads them to Jamaica where another cargo ship has been attacked and washed ashore. The damage on the ship's hull indicates that some kind of large beast had clawed its way through the hull in order to access the large numbers of fish the ship was carrying. Meanwhile a trio of Fishing Trawlers off the Atlantic Seaboard are dragged under for some unknown reason. The film then moves to New York City where we are introduced to Niko's ex-girlfriend, who is a struggling news reporter desperate to make her name with a major story. Coincidently, her big break arrives as Godzilla begins his attack upon the city, smashing his way through buildings, stomping on many unfortunate Taxi Cabs and generally running wild in the city before disappearing from sight. Niko is then brought to New York to assist in the search for the vicious beast that lurks in the bowels of the city. Realising that Godzilla has an appetite for fish, the Military prepare a fish trap by bringing piles upon piles of fish to one place in order to lure him out. But the plan fails and after another mad dash through the city, Godzilla loses his pursuers and disappears into the city's underground. Meanwhile, using some blood samples Niko determines that Godzilla reproduces Asexually and is either about to lay eggs or has done already. However, he is kicked off the case after his girlfriend steals at Top Secret tape from his tent in an earlier scene before broadcasting it on the news. His girlfriend attempts to apologise but Niko no longer has faith in her and leaves the scene, only to find that he has been shanghaied by a group of French Secret Service agents who had previously posed as Insurance agents. They plan to assist Niko in finding Godzilla's nest by breaking back into Manhattan disguised as American Soldiers. Meanwhile, another trap is set up in Central Park to subdue Godzilla, but this also fails and after another chase scene, the creature is forced into the Hudson River where he is blasted by torpedo's from pursuing Submarines. The city assumes Godzilla destroyed and prepare to re-inhabit Manhattan. However, Niko and the French agents, followed closely by his Girlfriend (who is desperate to make up to him) and a fellow News Cameraman, discover the nest in Madison Square Garden, where several hundred eggs have been laid. As the French agents prepare to set up explosives to destroy the nest, the eggs begin to hatch and since they smell of fish, the smaller monsters attack the agents. Eventually the group find themselves cornered in the Commentators box and send a message to the outside world about the presence of the deadly reptiles that could potentially become the new dominant species on the planet if the Garden is not destroyed by US Fighter Aircraft. Responding to their demands, fighters are dispatched and with seconds to spare, our heroes escape the building just before it is levelled with missiles. However, just as the group consider the day saved, Godzilla is revealed to have survived and now in a fit of Paternal rage, chases after the group who have now commandeered a Taxi. In a daring chase across the city, the group eventually tangle Godzilla in the suspension cables of the Brooklyn Bridge, allowing the fighters to come back and finish off the beast, which falls the ground and slowly dies. The City celebrates, Jean Reno quietly disappears and Niko and his Girlfriend get back together.Although this film seems to have a typical sort of story to it, and with the numerous factual inaccuracies and errors, it really is a good popcorn movie, and like many Roland Emmerich films, they are not there to be watched with a critical eye, but more to be watched with a casual sort of attitude, where you just sit back, disengage your brain and enjoy the film.

Yes it is factually inaccurate in some places, the CGI could do with a little brushing up and the acting could be refined slightly, but other than that, there is nothing to say this film is that bad to watch. It's pretty much just a turn off film for a rainy Saturday night and basically I have no real problems with that, just as long as it's not obnoxiously unenjoyable like other films of this calibre.The film begins showing reels of the Atomic bomb tests on the Bikini Atoll in the Pacific, and focuses specifically on the lizards that inhabit the island. The scene then cuts to a Japanese Cargo Ship, which is suddenly attacked by a large underwater creature with the loss of all but 1 of the crew. We then move to the evacuated Chernobyl, where our lead character Niko Tatopoulos is carrying out tests to see the influence of radiation on the genetics of earthworms in the area. But suddenly he is called in by the US Military to examine a large set of footprints that are spread across the Panama countryside. Meanwhile, the last surviving member of the stricken Cargo ship is asked questions by a mysterious French man played by Jean Reno, the only answer he is given is the chilling name of 'Godzilla'. The trail of the large footprints eventually leads them to Jamaica where another cargo ship has been attacked and washed ashore. The damage on the ship's hull indicates that some kind of large beast had clawed its way through the hull in order to access the large numbers of fish the ship was carrying. Meanwhile a trio of Fishing Trawlers off the Atlantic Seaboard are dragged under for some unknown reason. The film then moves to New York City where we are introduced to Niko's ex-girlfriend, who is a struggling news reporter desperate to make her name with a major story. Coincidently, her big break arrives as Godzilla begins his attack upon the city, smashing his way through buildings, stomping on many unfortunate Taxi Cabs and generally running wild in the city before disappearing from sight. Niko is then brought to New York to assist in the search for the vicious beast that lurks in the bowels of the city. Realising that Godzilla has an appetite for fish, the Military prepare a fish trap by bringing piles upon piles of fish to one place in order to lure him out. But the plan fails and after another mad dash through the city, Godzilla loses his pursuers and disappears into the city's underground. Meanwhile, using some blood samples Niko determines that Godzilla reproduces Asexually and is either about to lay eggs or has done already. However, he is kicked off the case after his girlfriend steals at Top Secret tape from his tent in an earlier scene before broadcasting it on the news. His girlfriend attempts to apologise but Niko no longer has faith in her and leaves the scene, only to find that he has been shanghaied by a group of French Secret Service agents who had previously posed as Insurance agents. They plan to assist Niko in finding Godzilla's nest by breaking back into Manhattan disguised as American Soldiers. Meanwhile, another trap is set up in Central Park to subdue Godzilla, but this also fails and after another chase scene, the creature is forced into the Hudson River where he is blasted by torpedo's from pursuing Submarines. The city assumes Godzilla destroyed and prepare to re-inhabit Manhattan. However, Niko and the French agents, followed closely by his Girlfriend (who is desperate to make up to him) and a fellow News Cameraman, discover the nest in Madison Square Garden, where several hundred eggs have been laid. As the French agents prepare to set up explosives to destroy the nest, the eggs begin to hatch and since they smell of fish, the smaller monsters attack the agents.

This one I saw What you Did from 1965 is delightful. Castle was known for this low-budget films; however, being fair, this is one of his better entries.Two teen-aged girls (Sara Lane, Andi Garrett) are alone in one of the girl's isolated homes; her parents are out of town. For fun, the two make prank phone calls. They pick random names out of the phone book (males, of course) and say in a breathy voice I Saw What you Did. Most of the folks on the other end laugh it off. Just their luck, a man who just murdered his wife (John Ireland) takes them literally, although they have randomly picked his name. Brought into the mix of all this is the man's lover (Joan Crawford) who listens in on the extension phone, thinking he's carrying on with another woman! Not knowing who the girl is (this is 1965, long before the days of caller ID, cell phones, or even touch-tone) he is left stewing and scared someone has actually seen him murder his wife. It all gets quite complicated and implausible, with the curious teens driving to the man's home, spying on him from the windows. They are caught by an enraged Crawford snooping around her lover's property (she lives next-door) and, in a hilarious scene, she calls the teen girl a tramp and forces her back into her car. The film does turn deadly serious when the murderer finds out where the girls live, with an ending that is quite suspenseful. First, a bit about the cinematography; it is quite good, using the most of the darkness and creepiness that surrounds the isolated house. A word about the performances the two teen girls are delightfully bad actresses, but we don't care because they are fun to watch. John Ireland is quite good, but stone-faced and lethal throughout. Crawford is dressed to the nines, in formal evening attire and a huge necklace that looks like it could have been worn by Cleopatra! She is oddly so in love with Ireland, that she tries to blackmail him into marrying her. It's all a hoot and a holler, but there are some genuine moments of suspense. Worth checking out!

Found out and twice shot, thrown in the ocean, he loses his memory. Then he finds himself being tracked down by his CIA superiors (Chris Cooper mainly) and targeted for death. He picks up Franka Potente on the way, and both participate in a movie-long chase.Although billed as realistic, because it eschews James Bond devices, and although it has a number of realistic touches, it's still a movie and has elements of pure fantasy with respect to how the CIA operates. I viewed it as strictly entertainment, not as some sort of enlightenment about the CIA. The CIA's nefarious activities go back for decades. They do engineer coups d'etats. They do employ disinformation. They do all sorts of dirty tricks. False flag events are in their toolkit. With all that and more, I doubt very much that superior A would assassinate superior B or even assassinate an assassin for having not done his job, and that's the basic plot. I doubt that the company is that efficient at tracking people and getting new assassins on the spot to kill other assassins.As entertainment, it's a decent enough movie. But it tended to run out of steam and continuity toward the end. The other major drawback was the staging and film editing of two fights. These were only partially well done. They were not milked for all they were worth in terms of suspense. In both cases, rapid film shots substituted -- and very poorly at that -- for genuine fighting and staging. This kind of trickery simply will not do.This is a picture where I thought the acting outdid the directing. The script had some excellent set pieces, but the director did not get the most suspense out of them. It's fair to say that Doug Liman did this without being particularly experienced at directing. While he probably did a good job relative to his experience, on an absolute scale a lot was left on the table. It could be that the film editing is the weak spot, because that was too rapid in several places.At any rate, I'm interested enough to go on to the next two in the series.

All of the actors seem to be over the top macho which does them no credit, almost like they have no other emotion. Also, Kris Lambert's fake Scottish accent is pretty laughable. But apart from that, it's an amazing bit of work and a real pleasure to watch.In 1518, a Scottish Highlander and Clan Leader named Connor MacLeod leads his Clan in a battle against another Clan. However, during the battle, Connor is mortally wounded by a mysterious warrior from a far away land known as the Kurgan. Before the deadly warlord can finish him off, his fellow clansmen force him away, the Kurgan declaring 'Another time Macleod!' The townsfolk consider him to be dead and begin to mourn. But suddenly, it is revealed that he has made a full recovery from the fatal wound, causing the others to believe that there is some Satanic power at work and so they force him from their village, with only his lover Heather being his companion. 5 years go by and MacLeod lives out in the countryside with his new wife, until one day an strange old man in foreign clothing named Ramirez confronts MacLeod and explains to him that they are both part of an ancient brotherhood of immortal men who cannot be killed unless they are decapitated. MacLeod doesn't believe this at first but after being chucked in the Loch, he soon realises that Ramirez speaks the truth and he agrees to train MacLeod to become the best warrior in order to stop the Kurgan from slaying the other immortals and thereby claim 'The Prize'. As Ramirez trains him, he tells him the various parts of his immortality. He tells him of the Quickening, which is an orgasmic sensation felt whilst absorbing the life energy from another slain immortal, and about the Gathering, where the few remaining immortals will travel to a far away location to fight to the last and thereby claim the prize. He also tells him to leave Heather as she is not immortal and will eventually die from old age, but MacLeod cannot do that.However, one night whilst MacLeod is away, the Kurgan finds Ramirez and Heather in his house and the two do battle. After a long and exhausting fight inside the collapsing structure, Ramirez is defeated and the Kurgan takes his head and rapes Heather. When MacLeod returns, all he finds is the ravaged Heather amongst the rubble and the headless body of Ramirez.

The two fight and MacLeod takes his head but is arrested by the Police as he attempts to escape. Meanwhile, the Kurgan (now going as Victor Kruger) arrives in New York as the Gathering commences. Although MacLeod is set free, he is closely watched by an NYPD Forensics Detective named Brenda, who he becomes sentimentally attached to. After a short skirmish with the Kurgan, she begins to question what logic is behind MacLeod and he is reluctant to explain to her the truth behind his immortality. However, as he becomes more and more sentimentally attached, the horrors of his previous relationship with Heather begin to echo back to him.Eventually, the Kurgan finishes off the last other immortal, leaving only himself and MacLeod to end the contest. Realising now that MacLeod has become sentimental with Brenda, the Kurgan kidnaps her and challenges MacLeod to the final battle in an abandoned warehouse. Through a long and complicated fight scene, MacLeod finally defeats the Kurgan and thereby wins 'The Prize' of all knowledge and the loss of his immortality, meaning he can live a normal life and raise a family without fear of outliving them.

It appears that, similarly to modern politics, today's cinema tends to be polluted by aberrations of a certain kind - the aggressive, pervasive, and loud extremes representing a nasty insult to the common sense. Moreover, the once distinct line between the mainstream and the extreme appears to have blurred. Many mainstream movies can now be considered to be extreme in a certain sense while independent movies have grown so numerous, popular, well-organized, and influential that they managed to successfully form their own local mainstream.On one end of the specter reside many of the popular mainstream movies.

The movie still remains among the best works of its writer Amy Holden Jones and its director Donald Petrie who have both gone mainstream since then. Amy Holden Jones is now mostly known for the Beethoven franchise, whereas Donald Petrie seems to have been recently focusing on the quite lightweight, purely entertaining formulaic comedies like Miss Congeniality, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, or My Life in Ruins.In addition to the good story and the solid directing, Mystic pizza offers almost perfect casting and generally strong acting, both ensemble and individual. The movie happens to be one of the first full-length features with Julia Roberts (Daisy Arujo). Right from the beginning, it becomes clear that Ms. Roberts has a remarkable talent &#x96; something that she successfully proved in many movies that followed.Annabeth Gish and Lili Taylor were charming and convincing in the roles of the two other teen girls - Kat Arujo and Jojo.

All of these movies carry certain elements present in 'Night&#x85;' but the all-out assault and apocalyptic cannibal carnage of Romero's debut feature film meant that Zombie movies were NEVER the same afterwards.In the middle of Pennsylvania, Barbara (Judith O'Dea) and Johnny, a brother and sister visit a graveyard to visit their father's grave but unbeknownst to them the dead have begun to reawaken and, stripped of the accoutrements of civilised, conscious thought, are reduced to ravenous cannibals. Barbara escapes to a house and meets Ben (Duane Jones) and together with an assorted bunch of others try to withstand both being laid siege by zombies as well as the corrosive internal power dynamics and individual survival instincts rife within the group.One of the things which contributes to the lasting power of 'Night&#x85;' is the creation of a believable atmosphere where we can feel the reeling minds of the characters swept up into an unprecedented situation, deprived of crucial information (the cause for the dead's unholy resurrection is speculated at within the film but never categorically confirmed) and thus fumbling in the dark as to the best solution. Another key factor is that, in a similar way to 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers', the monsters here are not figures of folklore like the Wolfman, or Dracula&#x85;or even the similarly revenant Mummy, but instead are our friends, neighbours, and family members. Indeed, it is this nightmarish vision of a society's anger turned inward which has led some to see it as a critique of the family and the Vietnam war, in addition to the searing attack on racism we see in the shocking final sequence.Certainly these sociological dimensions add a fascinating layer of analysis to the film (something Romero would continue in the next instalment of the '&#x85;Dead' series 'Dawn of the Dead') but this should not detract from the visceral quality of the film which (despite the parodies and scores of lesser Zombie movies that followed) remains as bold and fresh today as it was when it was released on the unsuspecting public back in the day.**************************Public domain movie.

So to do this, she wants to have a lobotomy performed on her niece who knows too much about her dead cousin. She offers lots of money to a local mental hospital if they will perform the operation, putting an idealistic young doctor in a very difficult position. Mama is Katharine Hepburn; Niece is Elizabeth Taylor; Doctor is Montgomery Clift. Writers are Tennessee Williams and Gore Vidal. Mama has kept her dead son Sebastian's garden exactly the same since his death (complete with Venus Fly Traps and other exotic plants you've never seen in your life.) She tells the doctor that on one of their many vacations, her son claimed to have seen the face of God. Not really the face of God, have you, but the symbolism of death, his own death, and a scary sub-reality that can only come from the mind of one of the greatest playwrights of any time, Tennesee Williams.The play Garden District was probably something that was very difficult to adopt to film, that's why Gore Vidal (recently deceased as of this writing) came in to assist him. This is a story that is certainly not for all audiences, and those expecting Elizabeth Taylor to be like she was as Maggie in Williams' Cat on a Hot Tin Roof won't find that here. Hepburn, too, has crossed the line from her witty comedies with Spencer Tracy into the bizarre, a tale of carnal lust that uses the tale of sea turtles burying their eggs in the sand and the flesh-eating birds who wait for them to hatch, as well as tales of using beautiful women to procure, and the eventual cannibalism that destroys its dead protagonist.Huh? you ask. In this viewing (out of about half a dozen), I had to research other people's thoughts on the film as well, and came up with the thought that people will see things differently, as they do in many of Tennessee Williams' writings. Having seen most of his work, I can only conclude that he was writing through a tortured soul, even as a genius though as they say, every genius has some touch of madness.The performances are outstanding, although some may see them as a lot over the top. But seeing Taylor and Hepburn together is a film lover's dream, and they play well off of each other, with Montgomery Clift (still recovering from that dreadful car accident) forced to be more of an earpiece to their dramatics. This asks the question, Who really is sane?, and gives some frightening visuals of an old fashioned Bellevue like mental institution. The sight of a delighted crazy woman rocking violently as everybody laughs at the sight of Taylor threatening to jump off a stairwell may give some people nightmares, yet you feel strangely sad for the crying man whose cards fell when Taylor made her way onto the stairwell of the men's recreation area. Mercedes McCambridge is believably befuddled, although I had a hard time accepting her as Taylor's mother.

Not really the face of God, have you, but the symbolism of death, his own death, and a scary sub-reality that can only come from the mind of one of the greatest playwrights of any time, Tennesee Williams.The play Garden District was probably something that was very difficult to adopt to film, that's why Gore Vidal (recently deceased as of this writing) came in to assist him. This is a story that is certainly not for all audiences, and those expecting Elizabeth Taylor to be like she was as Maggie in Williams' Cat on a Hot Tin Roof won't find that here. Hepburn, too, has crossed the line from her witty comedies with Spencer Tracy into the bizarre, a tale of carnal lust that uses the tale of sea turtles burying their eggs in the sand and the flesh-eating birds who wait for them to hatch, as well as tales of using beautiful women to procure, and the eventual cannibalism that destroys its dead protagonist.Huh? you ask. In this viewing (out of about half a dozen), I had to research other people's thoughts on the film as well, and came up with the thought that people will see things differently, as they do in many of Tennessee Williams' writings. Having seen most of his work, I can only conclude that he was writing through a tortured soul, even as a genius though as they say, every genius has some touch of madness.The performances are outstanding, although some may see them as a lot over the top. But seeing Taylor and Hepburn together is a film lover's dream, and they play well off of each other, with Montgomery Clift (still recovering from that dreadful car accident) forced to be more of an earpiece to their dramatics. This asks the question, Who really is sane?, and gives some frightening visuals of an old fashioned Bellevue like mental institution. The sight of a delighted crazy woman rocking violently as everybody laughs at the sight of Taylor threatening to jump off a stairwell may give some people nightmares, yet you feel strangely sad for the crying man whose cards fell when Taylor made her way onto the stairwell of the men's recreation area.

Coming from the director of Cliffhanger, you just know that this film is going to have enough explosions to make Michael Bay jealous. Sure enough, the film is loaded with explosive action and hard-hitting sword fights. A lot of the action dominates the film's final act, which is pretty much an all-out extravaganza of wild swashbuckling, booming muskets, and ear-shattering cannon fire. The rest of the film is fairly light and adventurous; maybe not perfectly-paced, but not too boring either. It also tries its best to be hard-edged, but it never really feels like anything more than a mere PG-13 flick. In this day and age, the Pirates of the Caribbean series totally supplants this film in all areas.The story for CI is pretty straightforward, and dare I say standard fare. Pirates get a hold of a map, find some treasure, then duke it out. That's pretty much it. The film tries its best to make the plot roll up and down in a standard thrill-ride formula, stretching the thin story out to fill the runtime. Even though it entertains, it's not terribly deep or anything. The best that can be said is that the characters are likable (including the villain).The film looks nice, with some decent and stylish photography and editing. Acting is not too bad; I enjoyed Geena Davis, Matthew Modine, and Frank Langella in their roles. Writing is not terribly sophisticated, but it gets the job done.

Carlito is trying very hard to stay 'clean' but as often being said 'You want to run away from your past but the past will not let you go'.Carlito is wiser now but he still carries with him a code of honor that unfortunately has long become dated. He does not recognize the new changes in the crime underworld of New York and fails to understand the new rules of the game. His new relationships with his old friend and lawyer David Kleinfeld (played by Sean Penn) and at a second level with former 'buddies' Saso (Jorge Porcel) and Lalin (Viggo Mortensen) show us that Carlito is not ahead of his game anymore. Carlito begins to understand this and tries hard to stay loyal to the only thing that connects him with his past self the old love interest (Penelope Ann Miller) who has not forgotten him after all those years but at the same time does not appear to trust him anymore.I need not say more about this exceptional film that may well be De Palma's masterpiece. Al Pacino gives one of his best performances on screen. A 9.5\/10 from me.ps. The shootout at the train station is extremely tense and despite being a remarkable technical achievement I do not think it adds that much to the movie. The strengths of the movie lie elsewhere. ","genre":null},{"date":"6 August 2012","score":"","review":" Al Pacino stars as Carlito Brigante an ex drug trafficker getting out of prison and trying to settle in a new environment. Carlito is trying very hard to stay 'clean' but as often being said 'You want to run away from your past but the past will not let you go'.Carlito is wiser now but he still carries with him a code of honor that unfortunately has long become dated. He does not recognize the new changes in the crime underworld of New York and fails to understand the new rules of the game. His new relationships with his old friend and lawyer David Kleinfeld (played by Sean Penn) and at a second level with former 'buddies' Saso (Jorge Porcel) and Lalin (Viggo Mortensen) show us that Carlito is not ahead of his game anymore. Carlito begins to understand this and tries hard to stay loyal to the only thing that connects him with his past self the old love interest (Penelope Ann Miller) who has not forgotten him after all those years but at the same time does not appear to trust him anymore.I need not say more about this exceptional film that may well be De Palma's masterpiece.
