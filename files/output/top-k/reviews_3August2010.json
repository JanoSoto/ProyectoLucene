The answer is damn skippy.Legend is part of my 80's fantasy holy trifecta; the other 2 movies being The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth.Legend is about The Lord of Darkness (Tim Curry) trying to create total darkness on earth (aka Goblin Paradise) so he can be all-powerful. In order to do this he must kill the 2 existing unicorns on the planet. Well, he doesn't necessarily have to kill the unicorns, rather remove their alicorns. It is up to the nature boy Jack (Tom Cruise), The Gump (a little German dude), 2 elves, and a sassy little fairy to stop him.That is the main plot of the movie, which I think is solid. It's the perfect fantasy formula. The sub-plot is about the relationship between Jack and Princess Lili (Mia Sara). She is a princess for those of you who refuse to acknowledge the director's cut. But we'll get back to that issue. To further the sub-plot, the Lord of Darkness is also after Lili, probably because she was the hottest princess in any movie ever made.This is 1 of 2 movies I like Tom Cruise in. His performance is fine. I think the movie makes him seem better than he actually is. Tim Curry was born to play the part of Darkness. I can't think of anyone better. Mia Sara was the second girl I fell in love with all because of this movie. She was great and really showed some range. She had to play sweet and innocent at the beginning of the film, frightened and confused in the middle, and dark and evil at the end. But my favorite performance of the whole film was Robert Picardo as Meg Mucklebones. Classic! The characters of this movie are rich and vibrant. This is in part due to the acting, but maybe even more so due to the atmosphere and f\/x of the movie. The atmosphere is something that Ridley Scott excelled in during the 80's. The sets and cinematography are grand and really bring the viewer into that world.The special f\/x of the 80's are my favorite kind, meaning no CGI. The makeup for Darkness, Blix, and Meg is some of the best ever. If this movie were made today (by people other than Jackson or del Toro) then those characters would have been completely CGI. The slime on Blix's face during the beginning while talking to Darkness, oh how it glistens! Now let's get down to business Theatrical release versus Director's cut. This is my favorite part to talk about. If you're like me, you grew up with the American, Tangerine Dream, theatrical release. I fell in love with this movie. Although I've always thought the soundtrack seemed out of place. For the longest time I thought I was going crazy though. I remembered a scene from this movie from when I was young but wasn't in my theatrical release VHS when I was older. I remembered the Meg Mucklebones scene being longer than the one on my VHS. After years of research, the version of the movie I had originally seen was the PBS cut which is basically the theatrical version with a few extended scenes including the MM scene. I also found that there are 5 confirmed cuts in all.I was introduced to the director's cut in 2005. This version has extended scenes all over the place as well as just flat out new scenes. It also had re-edited versions some of the same scenes. The first time I watched this version I thought it was stupid and thought I never would watch it again. But I had to watch it again mainly because it has the extended Meg scene which is my favorite. After about 12 viewings, I find the Director's cut superior. The only thing I really don't like about it is Lili's singing scenes. While I miss the Tangerine Dream score, the Jerry Goldsmith score is much more appropriate for a fantasy film and adds to the ambiance. The Tangerine Dream score dates it. And we finally find out that Lili is a princess! This has always slightly confused me in the theatrical release. I new she was upper class but wasn't sure about her specific status. Also, on the bonus materials on the Ultimate Edition DVD, there are deleted scenes that I wish were included in the actual movie. Fun fact There were actually 4 goblins at the beginning who were searching for the unicorns. We see how the 4th one dies as well as how Blunder gets his claw hand.The only real complaint I have about the movie is this When the heroes enter the layer of Darkness, the goblins are no where to be found. They are literally never seen again in the movie. It would seem to me that they would be protecting the unicorn or the tree from intruders. I never have really understood what happened with them.Again, this movie is the best fantasy movie of all time; yes, even better than any of the Lord of the Rings movies. Comment if you disagree, I dare you. This is my second favorite Ridley Scott movie. Director's Cut 9 out of 10. American Theatrical Version 8 out of 10.

Cosmatos; Starring Sylvester Stallone, Richard Crenna, Charles Napier, Steven Berkoff et al.This is the kind of film I watch when I want a straightforward action film one invincible hero and a lot of very bad 'bad guys' who are just waiting to get killed. Sylvester Stallone is John Rambo, our invincible hero who wants his country to love him and calls war his home. But let's forget Stallone's serious intentions with this film for a while and just focus on the incredible fun this film delivers in the action department. If you want action, you need villains, and the film offers some good ones. There are a great many Vietnamese soldiers, but let's not forget the number one enemy the Communists. In short Rambo First Blood Part II delivers a lot of action, a lot of laughs and somewhere amongst the dead bodies lies its message. Before I go into a more detailed analysis, let me sketch you the film's story.The film opens in an American labor camp, located somewhere on the globe, where Rambo is working out the sentence he got after the first film. Colonel Trautman (Crenna) can get him out if he goes back to Vietnam to find some P.O.W.'s. He agrees to do so, naturally, but when he' on his way to the camp the American government once again lets him down, betrays him and thus leaving him on his own amongst the evil forces. He's captured by the Vietnamese, who are aided by Russian colonel Podovsky (Berkoff, who previously acted as the villain in Octopussy and Beverly Hills Cop), who is very, very evil. After being electrocuted as a means of torture by a big Russian bad guy, Rambo escapes with the aid of his female ally Co (Julia Nickson), who happens to be in love with him. Incredible enough the story has room for a romantic scene between the two of them. She seems to be the only one who thinks Rambo isn't expandable, except colonel Trautman, Rambo's faithful commander. Murdock (Napier), the American in charge of the operation and responsible for betraying him, is now Rambo's primary target, but first Rambo has to deal with an entire camp of Vietnamese soldiers and a Russian attack force. Rambo naturally has no trouble at all killing every single one of them, be it with bullets, arrows, explosive arrows, knifes, or his muscular body. He also manages to save the P.O.W.'s along the way mission accomplished. Murdock isn't very happy with this, since there are no more obstacles between him and Rambo's revenge, but luckily Rambo isn't the worst guy to be around with.This very sophisticated story is filmed competently by George P. Cosmatos, who handles large action set pieces while also providing some nice scenery shots. What really makes this film so much fun to watch is something else though. This film wouldn't be the 80's action 'masterpiece' it is without Jerry Goldsmith's magnificent score. His synthesizers never sounded this cool and he wields his orchestra with so much thrust that the score seems to drive the action and the visuals, instead of the other way round. Goldsmith understood the incredible cheesiness of the film and scored it accordingly, with a deliciously over the top action score. Its incredibly heroic theme makes the action seem like a ballet and the 'tender' scenes between Rambo and his female companion are scored gorgeously dramatic. Dominating all of this are Goldsmith's ferocious synthesizers, with a dominating sort of chainsaw sound, which is just too cool for words. This is truly a masterpiece amongst action scores and perhaps the most energetic score ever. Without its score the film would be utterly pathetic, with it, it almost becomes a great film. Almost&#x85; for even a great score can't save a fundamentally bad film. As I see it the key to enjoying this film lies with your intentions towards it. If you watch this film with the intention of having a fun time, enjoying the indestructibility of John Rambo and the ease with which he kills off dozens of bad guys, you'll be thoroughly entertained. Ironically though, Stallone thought this film was a very serious endeavor and that Rambo was a very serious acting job. I wouldn't be surprised if he believed he could get an Oscar for it. If you watch the film like Stallone intended, you'll see this film for the failed attempt at serious filmmaking it is. There is a message, but it lies somewhere between the dead bodies on the battlefield, as a casualty of war. That is, it could be that the film's message is one that's close to your heart (which it isn't to mine), but it is still out of place in this film. It remains a failure in many parts, but what it does bring is tremendous fun, hence my positive rating of 6 \/ 10 for this film.

So why then did this movie have to be so vulgar and mean spirited?Could'nt this have been a slightly nicer movie, with at least a few good one liners to replace all the sexist remarks? Verhoeven really over sells the product. It might've helped a bit if Showgirls was marketed as a two hour porn, but nope, it is determined to be a fictional film. As repulsive as it looks, the film is not completely dry of entertainment value. The (for lack of a better euphemism) dance numbers are hot s**t. It is certainly very demanding on Elizabeth Berkly. If only she had spent as much time with an acting coach as she did with her dance choreographer. She delivers most of her lines like an infuriated loon, for no reason. By the time we find out why her character is so angry, it is way too late. Exposition comes at the beginning of a movie, not in the last twenty minutes. Quite frankly, nobody in the cast is a respectable character. Showgirls settles for being superficially entertaining. It doesn't even attempt to make its overlarge ensemble of characters into people that we want to spend time with. The screenplay comes with a rushed ending that leaves so much unexplained. It almost opens the door for a sequel, and quite frankly I wouldn't be surprised if Verhoeven had that in mind. Little does he realize that he has sold us way too much already. Some of it is entertaining in a lobotomized way, but the rest of it is pretty gross.

The genre goes back a long ways, and has shifted its tone and changed its course many times throughout cinema history. Gangster movies can stretch from some of the best movies the world has ever seen, to some of the worst. There are many that are must see films, and then there are those that aren't worth bothering with. Donnie Brasco is one of the ones worth watching.Johnny Depp (Pirates of the Caribbean, Edward Scissorhands) plays FBI agent Joseph D. Pistone who is on a secret undercover mission to gather information on the Mafia under the alias Donnie Brasco. He is clever, sly, and also short tempered. All these play an important role in the development in his character, as well as the story. Donnie first meets and quickly befriends Benjamin Lefty Ruggiero, one of the boss' right hand men. Because of this friendship, Donnie Brasco quickly gets his foot in the door and begins working his way up the mafia ladder. Yet, it isn't long until he becomes too engulfed in his alter ego, and he watches as the operation, as well as his family life, crumble around him.Donnie Brasco is a movie filled with intelligent and fast paced dialog, with characters that are all very intriguing and equally important to the progression of the story. With the kind of cast line-up that Donnie Brasco advertises, you'd expect nothing less than superb. And that is what you get. The fantastic big name stars deliver a very believable look into the darker side of mafia life. The chemistry between Depp and Pacino is very convincing, as well as riveting and exciting. Every exchange between the two will have you wanting more. Watching two great actors such as Depp and Pacino is a delicious treat to the eyes and ears, especially with hearty and fulfilling dialog to carry their characters. I think I've made it clear that the character driven aspect of Donnie Brasco is nothing short of brilliant.Before I continue I should make note that Donnie Brasco is based on a true story. The key word in this description is always based. When a movie is based on a true story it is expected that the truth will be stretched and dramatized for cinematic effect. However, I felt that this was only slightly true for Donnie Brasco. It seems that the movie didn't deviate much from the actual events, and this leads to a large chunk of the film simply being mob men doing mob things. Of course it all builds up and plays into the climax of the film, but I found myself losing interest towards the middle of the film. The way the film ends requires a lot of events to happen to get to that point, and some of these events aren't as thrilling as one might expect. Donnie Brasco seems to slow down and lose its focus in the middle, only to pick up again towards the end.I also had a problem with the story of Donnie Brasco's home life, where he is Joe Pistone. Because of his extremely secretive job, Pistone must keep many secrets from his wife and children for their own protection. While this side story ends up playing an important role in the film, I thought these scenes seemed out of place and possibly could have been worked in better. The storyline within these scenes themselves is very important and obviously very necessary. There is also the ending. The climax of the film is fantastic and will take you by surprise, but the very ending of the film is very abrupt and makes you feel like you might have missed something. It could possibly require a second viewing to fully understand what happened, but I'm not sure yet.From a character standpoint Donnie Brasco is excellent. The characters are great and their dialog greater. It is a story that keeps you interested, yet also leaves something to be desired. Overall Donnie Brasco is well worth the watch.

My sister told me when I was 3 years old that this film just made me cry and scream with fear. So I haven't seen this film since I was a child, but I don't know why I stayed away from it. I watched The Time Machine the other day and just fell in love with it. But I can see why I was such a traumatized child, those Morlocks were crazy scary, even though you could say that this is a bit dated, but it still has such great style and effects. Rod Taylor made such a great leading man, as George he is strong, intelligent and quick witted. The funny thing about this film is that I don't think that the future of this film wasn't far fetched, it's funny that the Eloi were just a bunch of air heads, even though you find out why and feel sympathy for them. But they do not read books and just sit there to look pretty, you could call the Morlocks celebrities as they feed off of the Eloi's worshiping them. This is the film that was before Idiocracy, once again, just not too far fetched and more disturbing when you think about it.On New Year's Eve 1899, a young inventor, George discusses time as the fourth dimension with friends. He shows them a tiny machine that he claims can travel in time. He claims that a larger version can carry a man into the past or the future. When activated, the device blurs, then disappears. Most of his friends dismiss it as a trick. George heads to his lab and sits in his full-scale model. He pushes the lever forward, and watches time pass at an accelerated rate. He stops the machine on October 12, 802,701, next to a low building with a large sphinx on top. George explores the seemingly idyllic pastoral paradise and spots young adults by a river. A woman is drowning, but the others are indifferent. George rescues her, but is surprised by her lack of gratitude or other emotion. She calls herself Weena and her people the Eloi. As night falls, George is surprised to find out that the Eloi have no government, no laws, and no civilization to speak of. Weena insists they go back inside after George tries to leave, for fear of Morlocks. A creature that eats the Eloi, explaining their lack of passion for knowledge or goals, they are specifically bred to die. George has to find a way to save the Eloi and get back home finding that this wasn't the future he wanted.The Time Machine has little flaws, the effects are pretty dated, most of the world collapsing scenes were obviously smaller sets split in half. Also the make up of the Morlocks could be considered dated, even though I still found them pretty creepy. I still found the film to be very effective despite little flaws that are very easy to let go of. But the chemistry between George and Weena was very sweet but also sad as their worlds are so different, they had a beautiful romance. The story also makes you wonder, we always ask one another if we would go back or forth in time if having the option and The Time Machine questions that notion once again as George sees a very sad future. I think this was a classic film and a great adaptation of the excellent novel. I don't see how anyone could dismiss this film, it's just a great film that I cannot wait to see again. Even to this day I still get the creeps from the cheesy make up of the Morlocks.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"3 August 2010","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" One of the things that used to scare me the most when I was a child was the film, The Time Machine.

A low budget thriller, which shocked the world and cinema forever. His successful career continued when he brought us a modern horror movie, The Birds (1963), which still is seen by many as the most intelligent horror film of all time. One year after Hitchcock continued his problematic cooperation with Tippi Hedren when he made Marnie (1964). Marnie was a critical and a box office flop, but today is seen as a classic. After Marnie Hitchcock started to film a new Cold War spy-film, Torn Curtain. He had made a movie with a similar subject earlier in 1959, North By Northwest. Hitchcock has said that he didn't like the cast he had to work with. He just had to take Julie Andrews and Paul Newman because they were hot and popular at the time. Alfred Hitchcock has other problems too with his crew, he wasn't satisfied with his composer, Bernard Herrman (Psycho) and replaced him by John Addison.As many good movies so is Torn Curtain, divided into three acts. Alfred Hitchcock added the change of perspective in each of the acts. In the first act we're in the shadows, we see everything from Sarah's point of view and are unaware of Michale's secret. When the agent, who is keeping an eye on Michael starts to have suspicions we move to act two, which is told us from Michael's point of view. This act includes the famous murder of Gromek (The agent). When Michael decides to tell the truth to Sarah we move to the third act, which is told to us from the perspective of Michael and Sarah.Even that Torn Curtain is very well forgotten, it has several well remembered scenes. For instance the murder of Gromek and the Balet scene. The interesting thing in the murder scene, is the fact how it resembles the shower scene of Psycho. In 1960 when Hitchcock was directing Psycho, Bernard Herrmann suggested a score for the shower scene, but Hitchcock denied. He said that it had to be a silent scene, absolutely. The audience should only hear screams and the stabs of the knife. But when Herrman kept on trying to get his music to the scene, Hitchcock agreed to try it. After the first listen he said This scene must have a score. Well in Torn Curtain, Alfred Hitchcock once again wanted to make the murder scene quiet, but Bernard Herrman composed a score for it. After their disagreements Hitchcock fired him and replaced with another composer. Surprisingly, John Addison also composed a score for the murder scene, but Hitchcock didn't use it and made the scene silent. Which in my opinion was a perfect choice. The silence leads us to the despair of the characters and to the fear of the fear that is in ourselves. The most horrifying fear is when we start to resemble our enemies.The famous scene, near the end, happens in the Balet hall. As in Hitchcock's earlier film, The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956) the drama of the play is reflected to the drama happening in the actual story. In The Man Who Knew Too Much a bullet is shot at the same time the cymbals crash. But in Torn Curtain Paul Newman's character sees the fake fire on stage, and gets the idea of shouting Fire! in order to escape the hall.Alfred Hitchcock always combined romance, excitement and humor. Sometimes he managed to put all of these elements in one scene. For instance in the scene with the bus. He was also known from his funny and sympathetic side characters. In Torn Curtain the best are agent Gromek, Professor Gustav Lindt and the Polish lady. Gromek is a very sympathetic character, which is very good, because many tend to shows communists and other bad guys as monsters. But Hitchcock showed that he was a human just like you and I. The same that Chaplin did with The Great Dictator, the Nazis weren't monsters, the ideology they were following was. There is a funny detail about Lindt, you see his name came from Hitchcock's favorite chocolate, Lindt. He is also a very sympathetic character. Then last but not least, the Polish lady, who is portrayed from too angles. First she seems sad, sympathetic, weak and a helpful lady, but then Hitchcock showed her darker side, a demanding person who can blackmail.Torn Curtain is a very well made spy film in many ways. It's very carefully designed, the cinematography is brilliant and the world of colors in costumes and set ups, designed by Hitchcock worked perfectly. His masterful visual narrative gets in its rights in many scenes. In the opening he manages to tell us many things, only using his camera, it's cold, there are scientists, two of them are missing and the main characters are in love. The film entails some thrilling, intelligent scenes, just as the films by Hitchcock always do. The critics called the film old-fashioned, but I thought it was very good. The subject was current, and adds historical interest to the film. It might not be his best film or No North By Northwest as the critics said, but it is a very well designed thrilling Cold War spy film. And by far superior than Hitchcock's other Cold War spy film, Topaz (1969), which is not a bad film either. Torn Curtain is an exciting film, with no dull moment, and it entails some intellectual themes, typical for the films from The Cold War.

But I haven't seen this movie in so many years, thankfully it was playing on TV and I was able to relive this classic tale of one of the greatest hero's in history, Robin Hood. Now one of the things I love about this film is it's genuine charm, as dated as it is, that actually makes this film more fun. The actors, the fights, the story and just the feel good message of this movie makes me fall in love with it all over again. Olivia de Havilland is absolutely gorgeous and had such amazing chemistry with Errol Flynn, you could see why they did more films together. The classic tale of Robin Hood is told differently each time and with a different vision, this was the more fun and family friendly version. With Errol Flynn's charismatic lead role, how could you not fall in love with him? He is the greatest actor to ever portray Robin Hood and brings you into this world of stealing from the rich and giving to the poor with his merry men.When Richard, the King of England, is taken captive while returning from the Crusades, his brother John takes power and proceeds to oppress the Saxon commoners. Prince John raises their taxes, supposedly to raise Richard's ransom, but in reality to secure his own position on the throne. One man stands in his way, the Saxon Robin Hood. Robin goes alone to see Prince John at Gisbourne's castle and announces to John's assembled supporters and a contemptuous Maid Marian that he will do all in his power to oppose John and restore Richard to his rightful place. His lands and title now forfeit, Robin takes refuge in Sherwood Forest with his friend Will Scarlet. There they meet and recruit Little John. Other men join their growing band. Later, Robin provokes Friar Tuck into a sword fight, but then persuades the friar into joining him to provide spiritual guidance to the outlaws. One day, Robin and his men capture a large party of Normans transporting taxes through Sherwood. Among Robin's guests are Gisbourne, the Sheriff of Nottingham, and Maid Marian. Robin and his men liberate the tax money, swearing to a man to contribute it towards King Richard's ransom. At first, Marian is disdainful of Robin and his band of cut-throats, but becomes convinced of his good intentions. The Sheriff then comes up with a cunning scheme to capture Robin. However, Marian warns Robin's men, and they manage to rescue him when he is captured. But now Marian is in trouble and labeled a traitor, sentenced to hanging and now needs Robin to save her.Although it being dated can be fun, it can also be considered a flaw, granted it was the 1930's, so you have to cut it some slack. So sometimes you cannot take it seriously with all the fights or some of the characters. But Errol and Olivia really deliver in this movie and you cannot deny that. The sets and costumes are just amazing as well, everything came out to look so beautiful in this movie. The choreographed fight scenes also are very thrilling as well, the fencing between Robin Hood and the villains were great to watch. But my favorite scene is when he teases the friar Tuck, I just couldn't' stop laughing and having a good time as you see the actors probably enjoyed making it as well. He rides Friar Tuck into the water just to press his buttons, it's a silly scene but makes you smile. When it comes to Robin Hood, this is always the classic tale that is sure to win you over.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"3 August 2010","score":"","review":" I used to watch a ton of classic movies when I was a kid with my parents, Robin Hood of course being on the list.

One day, Robin and his men capture a large party of Normans transporting taxes through Sherwood. Among Robin's guests are Gisbourne, the Sheriff of Nottingham, and Maid Marian. Robin and his men liberate the tax money, swearing to a man to contribute it towards King Richard's ransom. At first, Marian is disdainful of Robin and his band of cut-throats, but becomes convinced of his good intentions. The Sheriff then comes up with a cunning scheme to capture Robin. However, Marian warns Robin's men, and they manage to rescue him when he is captured. But now Marian is in trouble and labeled a traitor, sentenced to hanging and now needs Robin to save her.Although it being dated can be fun, it can also be considered a flaw, granted it was the 1930's, so you have to cut it some slack. So sometimes you cannot take it seriously with all the fights or some of the characters. But Errol and Olivia really deliver in this movie and you cannot deny that. The sets and costumes are just amazing as well, everything came out to look so beautiful in this movie. The choreographed fight scenes also are very thrilling as well, the fencing between Robin Hood and the villains were great to watch. But my favorite scene is when he teases the friar Tuck, I just couldn't' stop laughing and having a good time as you see the actors probably enjoyed making it as well. He rides Friar Tuck into the water just to press his buttons, it's a silly scene but makes you smile. When it comes to Robin Hood, this is always the classic tale that is sure to win you over.8\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure"},{"date":"3 August 2010","score":"","review":" I used to watch a ton of classic movies when I was a kid with my parents, Robin Hood of course being on the list. But I haven't seen this movie in so many years, thankfully it was playing on TV and I was able to relive this classic tale of one of the greatest hero's in history, Robin Hood. Now one of the things I love about this film is it's genuine charm, as dated as it is, that actually makes this film more fun. The actors, the fights, the story and just the feel good message of this movie makes me fall in love with it all over again. Olivia de Havilland is absolutely gorgeous and had such amazing chemistry with Errol Flynn, you could see why they did more films together. The classic tale of Robin Hood is told differently each time and with a different vision, this was the more fun and family friendly version. With Errol Flynn's charismatic lead role, how could you not fall in love with him? He is the greatest actor to ever portray Robin Hood and brings you into this world of stealing from the rich and giving to the poor with his merry men.When Richard, the King of England, is taken captive while returning from the Crusades, his brother John takes power and proceeds to oppress the Saxon commoners. Prince John raises their taxes, supposedly to raise Richard's ransom, but in reality to secure his own position on the throne. One man stands in his way, the Saxon Robin Hood. Robin goes alone to see Prince John at Gisbourne's castle and announces to John's assembled supporters and a contemptuous Maid Marian that he will do all in his power to oppose John and restore Richard to his rightful place. His lands and title now forfeit, Robin takes refuge in Sherwood Forest with his friend Will Scarlet. There they meet and recruit Little John. Other men join their growing band. Later, Robin provokes Friar Tuck into a sword fight, but then persuades the friar into joining him to provide spiritual guidance to the outlaws.

He is a cop without any equal and pairs with another cop who is only second but learns fast. The action is highly packed and intense and that is exactly what we want, what we like. But is action enough to make a good film? Of course not. The film is good first of all because of the small touches of humanity that are scattered all around, a dog as a best friend, a cat as a best buddy, and you can imagine the meeting of the two on Christmas day. A boat that has a front and a back and no water all around. Several kids who are as nice as kids know how to be when they are in a good mood, and we are surprised by the high level of resistance and resilience they demonstrate in the midst of that frantic action. A few black street boys who are deliciously anti-cop and just like ice cream so much that they start forgetting they are not supposed to speak to cops. A grenade that is a smoke bomb. A birthday that turns hectic with too many candles, definitely too many, on the cake. A shooting gallery that turns funny with bullets carving nice smiles into the faces of all the culprits in the world. And that and many more details make that film a real pleasure, nearly emotional. But the film is a lot better than that. When a country starts something dirty in the world against another country or another people, sooner or later the criminals that country has trained to do the bad job will come back to haunt everyone in their tombs or a little before they put them in their tombs. Killing machines are killing machines and you cannot stop them because you decide the war is over. That's why you should never start a war anywhere in the world, and those professional trained criminals can only be put to death because they will never accept any other trial or judgment, nor any period of peace and quiet at the bottom of a jail seen as an aquarium for gold fishes. They can only end fighting with real weapons and killed by real bullets, two rather than one, from two different guns rather than only one. That's what makes this film a lasting pleasure because in the world there is always the temptation to start a new war, and after starting a first one you cannot resist starting a second to spread the feast and the fun and make hundreds of thousands of people, in uniform or not, take part in the danse macabre that leads right to the cemetery, what's more an anonymous tomb of course, or just a collective grave, a big hole with some lye on top of the dismembered bodies.

For a little bit I considered it to be my favorite in the Indiana Jones series. For a time I cooled on it, thinking it to be a retread of the masterpiece 'Raiders' and now I find myself somewhat in the middle. For one thing, it is a retread of 'Raiders'. The plot is followed to the tee, the Nazi are looking for a religious artifact they can't grasp the significance of and Indiana Jones is the force of good in their way. In some ways though I really don't mind this. Spielberg and Ford care enough about their classic hero to merely engage in repetition. The thing that really makes me continue to love 'Last Crusade' is how it follows the best aspect of 'Raiders'. 'Last Crusade' acknowledges the fact that Indiana Jones is a human being beneath the fedora. He can be scarred emotionally and physically. This is evident by not just the relationship with his Father but also his search for the Holy Grail, which really is the pinnacle of finds.I like Nazis as villains and that's why the film didn't feel like a complete retread of 'Raiders'. They fit and represent a great mythological evil. The thought of Hitler holding the Cup of Christ is enough to make any one have fear run down the spine. One thing I think that 'Last Crusade' improves on over 'Raiders' is creating the story of good and evil. The Grail represents a certain spiritual purity and the Nazis want to blacken it. The fact that we are taken to a Nazi rally only adds to our fear. The moment where Indy comes face to face with Adolf Hitler is beautifully staged and acted on Ford's part. That look of terror and disgust in Indy's eyes is classic.The search for the Grail is the search for the divine in us all- so says Denholm Elliot in a terrific performance as Marcus Brody. I think this really beautifully sums up why 'Last Crusade' is such a great film. In a lot of ways Indiana Jones isn't just fighting Nazis, he's fighting his inner demons. Much is made of the relationship between Connery and Ford. I think there are moments here when Connery and Ford surpass anything they have ever done. Connery provides some needed comic relief but he is much much more than just a sidekick for Indy to bring with on an adventure. There is a great moment where Indy brings up the death of his mother to his father. The thought that someone as suave and strong as Indiana Jones is still lost in the grief over that has very real resonance to an audience. A superhero is only as good as the skeletons in his closet. The Holy Grail isn't merely a trinket, it is the representation of all Indiana Jones has sought to be. In some ways I wish there was more time in between action sequences to really get to know Indiana Jones. He's someone I'd rather have a chat with than go on a gunslinging adventure with(although that would be pretty awesome). Indy confronting his past, his strained relationship with his father, and his vulnerabilities are what makes the search for the Grail meaningful. The last scene between Connery and Ford is probably my favorite moment of the series.

They fit and represent a great mythological evil. The thought of Hitler holding the Cup of Christ is enough to make any one have fear run down the spine. One thing I think that 'Last Crusade' improves on over 'Raiders' is creating the story of good and evil. The Grail represents a certain spiritual purity and the Nazis want to blacken it. The fact that we are taken to a Nazi rally only adds to our fear. The moment where Indy comes face to face with Adolf Hitler is beautifully staged and acted on Ford's part. That look of terror and disgust in Indy's eyes is classic.The search for the Grail is the search for the divine in us all- so says Denholm Elliot in a terrific performance as Marcus Brody. I think this really beautifully sums up why 'Last Crusade' is such a great film. In a lot of ways Indiana Jones isn't just fighting Nazis, he's fighting his inner demons. Much is made of the relationship between Connery and Ford. I think there are moments here when Connery and Ford surpass anything they have ever done. Connery provides some needed comic relief but he is much much more than just a sidekick for Indy to bring with on an adventure. There is a great moment where Indy brings up the death of his mother to his father. The thought that someone as suave and strong as Indiana Jones is still lost in the grief over that has very real resonance to an audience. A superhero is only as good as the skeletons in his closet. The Holy Grail isn't merely a trinket, it is the representation of all Indiana Jones has sought to be. In some ways I wish there was more time in between action sequences to really get to know Indiana Jones. He's someone I'd rather have a chat with than go on a gunslinging adventure with(although that would be pretty awesome). Indy confronting his past, his strained relationship with his father, and his vulnerabilities are what makes the search for the Grail meaningful. The last scene between Connery and Ford is probably my favorite moment of the series.

For a little bit I considered it to be my favorite in the Indiana Jones series. For a time I cooled on it, thinking it to be a retread of the masterpiece 'Raiders' and now I find myself somewhat in the middle. For one thing, it is a retread of 'Raiders'. The plot is followed to the tee, the Nazi are looking for a religious artifact they can't grasp the significance of and Indiana Jones is the force of good in their way. In some ways though I really don't mind this. Spielberg and Ford care enough about their classic hero to merely engage in repetition. The thing that really makes me continue to love 'Last Crusade' is how it follows the best aspect of 'Raiders'.
