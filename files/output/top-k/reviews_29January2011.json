Of course you do, it's arguably your best film, remember the script you wrote you know that super tight script, you remember the memorable and of course likable characters that gave fast, smart, and witty dialogue? You made and how great you made the character development yeah you do, a two hour and 15 min film and you just made it fly by. James Cameron you arguably made the greatest Sci-Fi Action film of all time. So when you're making Avatar 2 please work on the script, character development, of course characters and dialogue please, also make it less of a drag to watch than the first one.Sincerely,Alex LTerminator 2 like I said is arguably the best Sci-Fi Action film of all time and is in my top Ten Films of all time. The Plot The T-1000 is sent back to kill John and The Terminator a.k.a T-800 (Schwarzenegger) is sent back to protect John reprogrammed by John himself. Then the whole movie is about John, Sarah, and The Terminator needing to destroy the T-1000 and to stop judgment day from happening. The Characters Edward Furlong plays John Connor. For Furlong there are two films he is know for, this and American History X, I like him better in Terminator 2. Essentially he plays mean, messed up kids in both of them, but what seals the deal for me is his father son relationship with The Terminator. With saying that I should mention that the way the characters change was excellent, from the first film and also during this film. The Terminator changing from a killing machine into a father like figure, and Sarah from being scared to death from the future to learning that we as a human race can learn to make the future better. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays The Terminator a.k.a T-800. He actually does a better job than he did in the first Terminator, mostly due to the fact that he has more lines and the way he becomes a father figure to John. He makes himself an incredibly likable father figure machine; let's just say he becomes incredibly likable that at the end of the movie it was making me tear up a little. Linda Hamilton plays Sarah Conner the most badass female character of all time (some of you might say Ripley or The Bride but I stand my ground). I really don't know any other film Linda has been in besides the first two Terminators. In the first terminator she played this wimp of a girl and almost gets killed by the first terminator, in this one she this badass taking people out with a broomstick, stabbing people in the legs with pens or just explaining to someone how many bones there are in the human body, but is still worried about John's safety and preventing judgment day from happening, but by the end of the movie like I said she realizes that the human race is able to learn how to make the future better. (Remember it's just a movie) Robert Patrick plays the T-1000, he did an excellent job showing no emotion or sympathy for anyone else just kept a straight serious face, a killing machine, he fits the role perfectly.Everything Else Terminator 2 like I said and I will say it again is arguably the best Sci-Fi action film of all time, for me it is. I'm just gonna say that everything in the film is top notch. The sound, action, special effects, everything is perfect, a fantastic looking film. What I love about the action is that it looks real especially with the car\/motorcycle chases, Cameron did an excellent job with them and he sure knows how to direct an action scene(s). He also somehow made this two hour and 15 minute film just fly by, it never felt like a drag to watch, it was fun to watch and it is still fun to watch over and over again, I believe this is the film I've watched the most. The special effects were fantastic for the time and today they still look pretty damn good, very revolutionary for the time. But it isn't the best looking film of all time to me that goes to 2001 A Space Odyssey. What I learned by watching the film There are 206 bones in the human body The Conclusion What really made me love this film (besides being the best action film I've seen) is the characters, they are likable they are fun they make the movie worth watching until the end (besides the action). I honor James Cameron as a master of sequel making with this and Aliens. Hopefully he will continue this tradition with Avatar 2 I believe he can, but I don't think I believe too much because of the first Avatar. Avatar 2 comes out in 2014 so hopefully he will hit gold with that one. I'm not saying I hate the first Avatar, I just think it's his worst work. Terminator 2 Judgment Day with the action and especially characters and fast pace, this is what am I saying arguably, James Cameron made THE GREATEST Sci-Fi Action Film of all time.

It must have been because I was very young. I wasn't even born when the movie first aired! However, I do remember a few scenes from this movie. The ones that stuck with me throughout the years were the very, very sad scene of Bubba dying and the oh-so-famous quote Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get. This movie starts with a feather floating in the background, getting flown all over in the place, when finally it lands beside some dirty rubber shoes. The owner of these shoes, Forrest Gump, picks it up and keeps it. He just sits there, quietly all by himself, when a woman sits beside him on his bench. He then greets her and thus, begins the narration of his life story.His story is wonderful. I loved everything about it. Forrest wasn't exactly the brightest crayon in the box. On top of that, he couldn't even walk properly. His IQ was a poor 75 and he couldn't even get accepted into a public school. But his mother did everything for Forrest. His mother was great. You could see she struggling.I thought it was very cute the way Jenny and Forrest's friendship blossomed. How she invited him to sit beside her. The way they hung around with each other in their tree and just talked about anything and everything. Jenny was very protective of Forrest. When the first bullying encounter happened and Jenny told Forrest to run? That made my skin have goosebumps. It just felt good. Run, Forrest! Run! I also never realized back then that Jenny was having trouble with her father. But now, I understand. Jenny's prayer was also.. Amazing. Dear God, make me a bird. So I could fly far. Far far away from here. That just touched me.After his friendship with Jenny, Forrest met Bubba during the Vietnam War, after he finished college. During the scene where Forrest first entered the bus, it was like the first day of school all over again! Nobody would let Forrest sit with him. Until he came upon a guy who had a weird lip jutting out. That was the start of their strong brotherhood.I felt like the time they spent together was so short. I didn't even cry when Bubba died. It was weird since I was expecting to cry, seeing as how Bubba's scene was the one that stayed with me all throughout the years. I'm so disappointed in my lack of emotional attachment. But I still love Bubba. ) It was nice how Forrest went on with his shrimp catching business just for the sake of keeping his promise to Bubba.The two things that changed during my previous screenings and the one I had tonight were 1.) I liked Lt. Dan more than I thought I would and 2.) Jenny wasn't all that great.I'll talk about Lt. Dan first. First of all, I didn't even remember him! I was even shocked when I saw that his legs were cut off! See how much that didn't affect me. But he was a good friend. He became one of Forrest's best friends. He even stood up for him when one of the hookers called Forrest stupid. I thought Dan didn't care, but that proved me wrong. They even became partners with the whole Bubba-Gump thing. Sweet.Now, about Jenny. I don't see why Forrest liked her. Yes, I get that they were friends since childhood, but after they grew out of their childhood, she kept leaving him! I was so mad after she left him during the morning after. At least that sparked Forrest's will to run all over America. Hm.The ending was great. I forgot all about that. What a welcome surprise. It's just a shame that Jenny died, too, in the end. All of Forrest's loved ones passed away. All he's got left is Little Forrest. I guess in a way, that was nice. He had someone to look after and someone to look after him. ) There were a lot of great cameos that I was on a look out for. I loved that Elvis part! I even took a second look to check if that guy was really Elvis! Yes. I know. It's impossible since he's already dead, but hey! It seemed realistic. There were also meetings with different presidents. And a deal he had with a very famous fruit company. The cameos just kept coming and coming. And it worked! The main message of this movie was that life just keeps on going. Bad things are inevitable, but you can trust that there will be a million good things that will come your way. It's a movie about life. Forrest Gump teaches you things. He sees the world from a different viewpoint. Not an idiot's viewpoint. But a child-like sort-of perspective. No biases at all. Just an average things-the-way-they-actually-are perspective. This is one movie you mustn't dare miss. Wonderful movie. Just wonderful.

The cliques that they come from is the 'Brain' Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall), the 'Athlete' Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez), a 'Princess' Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald), a 'Basket Case' Allsion Reynolds (Ally Sheedy), and a 'Criminal' John Bender (Judd Nelson). Throughout this day they taunt each other, make jokes, and party, this helps them come to an understanding of each other and become friends by the end of the day. This may seem like a typical teen movie except it really hits home not just during 80's but, for every generation that has come after. They did not want to go to the school and on some levels were concerned with being cool and fitting in, not getting along with their parents but wanting to please them at some levels. The pressure they have from their peers, during the scene where they were all sitting on the library floor and Brian asks if they will still all be friends come Monday. Claire said no, that they would say hi to them and then cut them down when they walked away so their friends would not make fun of them for talking to the others.This film touches base with the pressures these teens go through at home. Claire's parents use her to get back at each other. Brian's parents expect perfection, Andrews father expect him to be a winner and put down those who are not. Allison's parents ignore her, and John's parents are physically and mentally abusive to him. Most of us could relate to one if not more of these teens home lives which makes this film feel more personal having that insight into many lives. Staying in the time period of the 80's the film 'Pretty in Pink' you see many of the same teen issues of fitting in and the pressures that come with it. When two teenagers start to like each other and they are from opposite sides of the tracks. When Andy Walsh (Molly Ringwald) and Blane McDonnagh (Andrew McCarthy) want to start dating and their friends put pressure on them about how it is not right due to they are not in the same clique. At the end they decided that they did not care and some of their friends changed their minds and others were still against it.The theme song for this film fits it perfect 'Don't forget about me' by Simple Minds. In this song it talks about telling your troubles, and how love is strange, these two things happen in the film when they all tell each other their problems and when Andrew and Allison and John and Claire have connections with each other from more than a friendship. When the song says 'will you recognize me?' this is told during the scene when Brian asks if they will still be friends on Monday. The song really relates to the fact in the movie that some are worried what will happen when they are in school with their other friends will they say each other's names? Or just walk on by.During the dance part of the film when they were playing the music in the library the camera shows the actors in a long, medium, and close up shots, this shows them dancing alone defining them from different cliques. Then we see them dancing together in long shots this helps to show that even though you can see from their appearance that they are from different worlds in this school, it shows that they are connecting with each other through the music. When they dance together you see John and Allison, then the three guys together, then the two girls. The Breakfast Club depicts what kids go through from the pressures of teen life not just from the 80's but today and generations to come. People can find themselves in one if not more of the characters and relate to the problems and pressures that they are going through.

To be honest I was inspired for some reason to watch this after revisiting STAND BY ME for the first time since I was a teenager. THE GOONIES is raucus and busy, with kids bucking for their time on screen. A cast of child actors, some of whom would become successful adult actors(particularly Josh Brolin, with Astin would hitting paydirt with RUDY and the Lord of the Rings movies), I'm not sure how director Richard Donner escaped unscathed without a stint in the nuthouse. Entering into my thirties, I have been on a nostalgia trip and this movie, truth be told, was more fitting to when I was 10, now as a father I deal with kids like these and so I shutter instead of necessarily grin with affection for these wild brats. Oh, I'm no curmudgeon, these kids are near and dear to my heart--I was their age when this movie was made and had a little brat in me as well, but I'd be lying if I didn't admit that a lot of the noise become a bit of an annoyance. Not too irritating, mind you, but putting together this many kids, crowding scenes with overlapping dialogue, can be a bit much from time to time. The energy and enthusiasm, though, is viable and rubbed off on me yet again, as always..I can not deny that. As you might expect, the Spielbergian schmaltz is laid on thick with the whole foreclosure subplot and how the Goon Docks kids ban together for one last great adventure hoping to save their home from being knocked down. Who'd of thought that caves were underneath the city containing booby traps with falling rocks, floors that fall away, skeletons galore, and even a pirate ship--those Warner Bros sets are utilized to the hilt. Even One-Eyed Willie makes an appearance. Kids should eat this up for generations to come even if we ourselves eventually grow up and find it less effective. Sloth and Chunk(with food always on the brain) are quite a pair, Mama's misbegotten(she dropped him on his face twice after giving birth to him, hence the facial malformations and child-like sensibilities)son becoming the hero at the end. Astin is the driving force behind the hunt, always motivating the pack to pursue the grand prize which might save Goon Docks.

On one simple level, it's enjoyable as a tightly made film, period. The acting, writing, editing, and photography--coordinated of course by now legendary director Billy Wilder--snaps like a whip, and two hours goes by fast. A host of minor actors pull of major performances, and the one really big name, William Holden, has the most unusual role, and he gives it an unfriendly edge that really helps save the movie. Save the movie, that is, from a kind of frivolousness. It is, at its core, a really well made sitcom. The situation is a Nazi prison camp, not the kind of place we expect humor. And the comedy comes from making fun of the Nazis, who are always fair game. The reference to Hogan's Heroes is no joke, for those who have seen that 1960s series around the same situation (even including a comic Sgt. Schultz). The producers of Stalag 17 sued the producers of Hogan's Heroes and won. But Stalag is not just a comic romp. There are shades of bitterness that reflect a real camp--almost the kind of gallows humor you need to survive a horrible situation. And there is also a serious strand about who you can trust, about finding the traitor on the inside, and about persecuting the wrong man. Strictly a studio production, this falls just three years after Wilder's Sunset Blvdwhich uses Holden in another embittered role, and which makes fun of studio productions and Hollywood in general. Though based on a Broadway play, it rises above any sense of being set on a stage, and yet it really does not achieve any sense of realism. It's just short of a farce. The narration at the start announces that here, at last, we will have a movie not about the front and fighting, but about prisoners in a prison camp. It announces, that is, that it will be a different kind of WWII film.And it is. Holden won best actor for his role. Otto Preminger, the great German director working in Hollywood (and bucking the censors there), plays the commandant of the prison. And Peter Graves is another prominent prisoner, a counterpart to Holden. The photography is by none other than the great Ernest Laszlo, and Franz Waxman heads up the music.

Strictly a studio production, this falls just three years after Wilder's Sunset Blvdwhich uses Holden in another embittered role, and which makes fun of studio productions and Hollywood in general. Though based on a Broadway play, it rises above any sense of being set on a stage, and yet it really does not achieve any sense of realism. It's just short of a farce. The narration at the start announces that here, at last, we will have a movie not about the front and fighting, but about prisoners in a prison camp. It announces, that is, that it will be a different kind of WWII film.And it is. Holden won best actor for his role. Otto Preminger, the great German director working in Hollywood (and bucking the censors there), plays the commandant of the prison. And Peter Graves is another prominent prisoner, a counterpart to Holden. The photography is by none other than the great Ernest Laszlo, and Franz Waxman heads up the music. It's no wonder it's a smart, sharp, snappy film. What it isn't, however, is deep or probing or moving. It's an entertainment, and a great one, but it keeps any larger expectations in check. And so should you. ","genre":"Drama, War"},{"date":"29 January 2011","score":"","review":" There are two kinds of people those who like The Sixth Sense better and those who like The Others better. I'm part of the first group, and with reason. For starters, the musical score. In TSS the soft, melancholic, soundtrack is part of the plot; you can't imagine one without the other. Then, even if you have a similar final twist in both, the one in TSS is more effective, having all the advantage just for having come first. Speaking of advantages, TSS got also the most important one the characters. Every one of them there is likable; we get in their shoes, we rejoice with them in their happy moments and suffer when they suffer; we feel their pain--to use a Clintonism. We load upon ourselves the emotional burden Malcolm is carrying, that of having failed to one of his child patients, we experience the night terrors of Morgan; the frustrations of Lynn, the loneliness of Anna. It's all that which maintains us completely focused in their personal stories, their sorrows, their plight, and so when the bang finally comes it hit us with full force, because it catches us looking elsewhere.In The Others instead there's no one single likable character. Now, I understand that to make the end twist credible we have to be convinced that Grace is a psychologically unbalanced woman; and that's how she comes out, but at the price of making her unlikable, even more so with her unnerving habit of locking every door after her&#x97;even when running to her kids' help!. I don't know if this was Amenábar's intention, but after 30 min I had enough; I had become unsensitized to anything that could happen to her, so when the time for real drama came I watched it all with mostly indifference. I can't possibly compare that to Toni Collette's work in TSS in a similar role. In her best moments there she even made that old empathy meter melt. As for the kids, they are weird more than anything else&#x97;even if I can understand why&#x97;and the servants are even weirder; not to mention the absent husband, who seems to have come back just for a one night stand. You can talk me all you may want about score, cinematography, acting, pacing, and so on, but this film needs something more to be able to work&#x97;as the plot itself is quite simple, to the point of lameness--and that can only be likable characters.Note something else here; the atmosphere, the mood, is not set by a combination of elements like settings, score, camera work, all of them firmly in the hands of the filmmaker, but almost exclusively by Kidman's acting work. She is the one who sets and defines the mood here and the one keeping it still for some time during the film. I understand that is most probably the director's artistic choice, but it looks a lot like laziness--Okay, let's just set the lights low and make her do the rest. That's another important difference with TSS, where Night Shyalaman's hand can be clearly seen in every frame, every image; he never lets the actors do what is his own job. Most probably such a choice was made here out of necessity, as the story is built in such a way that there's no other alternative, but that's a choice and sometimes you pay a price for the choice you made. Here, you take out Kidman's work and all you got left is unexplained noises here and there and five rather weird characters. The whole plot falls into pieces.Judging for what I see in The Others, Amenabar looks very much like any other Buñuel disciple, although I wouldn't go as far as to call him a wannabe, because he's clearly his own man, artistically. But Buñuel's influence is so obvious in this film and this isn't praise anyway. I don't remember having seen any likable character in Buñuel, because he was always tackling deeper, meatier, more complex issues than a simple puzzle about who is dead and who's not. Many times you get so lost in his films, you have to spend your time trying to find the exit or figuring them out; you don't know if what you are seeing is reality, or a dream; or which scene happened after which other, of if such scenes even happened at all. You had your hands full enough with all that to be caring much about likable characters. But in Others you got to care for them--as the twist is obvious for many from the very beginning, I guess--and if you don't, the movie loses all its interest for you (as for myself, before 20 min. I had already guessed that the servants and the kids were ghosts and was left doubting only about Grace. So much for surprise twists).The film have great suspense moments anyway, specially the ones in the junk and the piano rooms. But undoubtedly the last 15 min. are the best, as they bring about the climax and the denouement. The séance bit is excellent, but Amenábar lost there the chance to make it spookier and more consistent with the rest of the film--why they only see the alive NOW, not before? The point is, there was no need for showing the alive, as all what we--and the family--needed was to see the pencil frantically scribbling on the piece of paper, and the voices of the living, to understand the truth; just watch this scene with your eyes closed and you'll see what I mean. All in all, 6\/10. I would have given it more, but I at this point I had become rather emotionally detached from the characters.BTW would you feel comfortable living your after-life with the mother who murdered you?

It does exactly what it advertises and nothing more. 'Single White Female' delivers thrills. They aren't the best of thrills by any stretch of the imaginations. The film really plays like the most mundane of Lifetime thrillers. The only thing that keeps this from being completely forgettable is the performance by Jennifer Jason Leigh as Heddy.Leigh's performance is inspired. The character of Heddy isn't really all that interesting. She is built upon dime story psychoanalysis and is kind of annoying. Leigh however has really made the most out of a terribly written character. Leigh's performance I felt draws us away from Fonda's Allie. Which character is more compelling? The sad psychotic?

We pity her even to the point where we realize that she is capable of awful things. There are several scenes that with a lesser actress would like pretty stupid but Leigh makes them work despite our senses. I refer to the scenes where Leigh doubles as the Fonda character. The scene where Heddy reveals her haircut is chilling in a great way.

There's more that isn't altogether right, but hey, it's a story and there were good points too.I liked the love story. Even if it's just because I like to think of Uma Thurman in love with, well, anybody. Why not me then, eh?

I like to look that way at windmills myself, even those stupid modern things.That said, the film also looks great. I was going to say it looks real, but then I thought of the detectives in trench coats and hats and I thought, no, real is not the right word. It looks good, it looks like a world you can accept for real. Something that is presented you, that you can project your own thoughts onto. That's no mean feat.I thought the acting was great throughout, from Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman dancing to the guy in the wheelchair struggling up the winding stair case (well, he was out of his wheelchair there). Only, why did the other guy suddenly appear in the downstairs room? Where the heck did he come from? I didn't know Gore Vidal could act, but he does a fine job as the director.As to the general plot, should or should we not develop an improved human being, it is interesting to note that in the same year this film came out in Europe, Michel Houellebecq, the french author, published his great novel 'The elementary particles'. In it, he states in a rather dry manner that we will choose to do so. According to Houellebecq, it's even the only way out of our current predicament of chaos, wars and general misery.

Talk about ruthlessness... ) As I said, the film is rather ambiguous and can't (or won't) choose between dystopia or utopia.So, all in all, though the film is flawed, it's actually the flaws that contribute to making it a thought-provoking, sympathetic film. Seven stars for that. Why not more stars? Well, there's the brother thing. Also, I find that payoff 'I never saved anything for the swim back' quite excruciating. On the other hand, I just read a review of somebody with major birth defects who says the film is important because it sends the message that the improbable isn't impossible.

I was going to say it looks real, but then I thought of the detectives in trench coats and hats and I thought, no, real is not the right word. It looks good, it looks like a world you can accept for real. Something that is presented you, that you can project your own thoughts onto. That's no mean feat.I thought the acting was great throughout, from Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman dancing to the guy in the wheelchair struggling up the winding stair case (well, he was out of his wheelchair there). Only, why did the other guy suddenly appear in the downstairs room? Where the heck did he come from? I didn't know Gore Vidal could act, but he does a fine job as the director.As to the general plot, should or should we not develop an improved human being, it is interesting to note that in the same year this film came out in Europe, Michel Houellebecq, the french author, published his great novel 'The elementary particles'. In it, he states in a rather dry manner that we will choose to do so. According to Houellebecq, it's even the only way out of our current predicament of chaos, wars and general misery. The film unwittingly makes rather the same statement. I mean, who wouldn't choose to be part of that elite group, live longer and healthier and be part of a safer and sounder system? (eh, does anybody notice how the women select their partners these days? Talk about ruthlessness... ) As I said, the film is rather ambiguous and can't (or won't) choose between dystopia or utopia.So, all in all, though the film is flawed, it's actually the flaws that contribute to making it a thought-provoking, sympathetic film. Seven stars for that. Why not more stars? Well, there's the brother thing. Also, I find that payoff 'I never saved anything for the swim back' quite excruciating. On the other hand, I just read a review of somebody with major birth defects who says the film is important because it sends the message that the improbable isn't impossible. And then I know the story of Neil Young and his kids, especially Ben. Alright then, eight stars it'll be.

Books and movies are my great passions. I love both. That's why, whenever we have a family movie night, I usually end up getting the task of finding the right movie to watch. This is a considerably difficult process. I have to keep in mind a little sister who hates violence of any sort, a younger brother who loves superheroes, a father who enjoys Arnold Schwarzenegger action rampages, and a mother who enjoy romantic movies.I finally decided on Sister Act as the movie for tonight. I remembered watching it vaguely as a child, and loving the concept of singing and dancing nuns. All this time later, this very fun film entertained all of us when we sat down to watch.First of all, Whoopi Goldberg is a nun. If that isn't funny already, I don't know what is. Goldberg plays Deloris, a lounge singer who witnesses a mob killing courtesy of her boyfriend (Harvey Keitel). She goes on the run when he tries to have her killed. Long story short (too late), she winds up in a convent which is presided over by Maggie Smith, a stern yet not entirely unsympathetic nun. Deloris, now Sister Mary Clarence, livens things up around the convent, and becomes the choir director, turning an awful group of singers into an excellent choir. (Perhaps too quickly. It might have been fun to see them struggle a bit longer.) The premise is quite funny, and it's a real delight to have the nuns singing and dancing in some really inspired routines. The songs themselves are actually excellent, and this movie probably has my favourite version of Hail Holy Queen ever. It starts with a very traditional rendition of the song, and then morphs into something very different.The real stars in this movie are the nuns. They are all cast so well, particularly those in the choir. They all seem so sweet, friendly, and innocent, and it's riotously funny when they start singing upbeat renditions of church music.There's plenty of really good stuff in here. The religious jokes work really well, the singing nuns are a riot, and Goldberg has tremendous fun throughout the movie, along with a few other nuns. I have only one complaint. The direction is bad. It's often extremely clumsy or amateurish, and the movie's crime subplot is horribly executed. The movie is still extremely entertaining and funny, mainly due to the actors.So was this movie Oscar-worthy? Hell no. Pardon the pun. But it did what it was supposed to do it entertained us all tremendously and was tons of fun to watch. I wouldn't hesitate to watch it again. Or twice more. Maybe even more times.

The thing that struck me the most was how no one person was actually evil but when a group of people get together it's a different story.The atmosphere is genius, the layout of the town looks vivid and alive.

As I said in the start of this review when something is taught to you, you don't think to question it. The only conclusion I can come to is that it's relying on blind hatred of some offense you think happened or were told happened.

These two sisters play for a local softball team and are scouted to play professional while the men are away at war. Dottie doesn't want to leave home and play baseball she is happy at home waiting for her husband to return from the war, Kit on the other hand is very excited and anxious to leave home.The entire movie is about the focus on these two sisters and their differences. Kit is forever finding herself in her sister, Dottie's shadow, but Dottie doesn't care as much about the game as Kit does. Kit and Dottie find themselves on different teams because of the competition and family disputes, and face off in the World Series. The winning play comes down to Kit running for home base while Dottie tries to get Kit out, because Kit's determination of the game is stronger Kit slams into her sister and wins the game.The movie focuses on these two characters and their complex sibling relationship. The movie portrays Dottie as a better player than Kit but she doesn't have the heart for it, Dottie's only care is her husband and mentions a few times throughout the film that she just wants to be home with him. Kit has a drive to get away from her home, and to not be compared to her sister anymore. Even though Kit and Dottie see things differently the movie shows that siblings can have a complex relationship.This movie reminded me of the Spitfire Grill, a movie about a girl joining a family, she was perceived to be different and she was trying to earn their acceptance. Like the woman in the Spitfire Grill, Kit knew she was different than her sister and wasn't traditional like Dottie. Kit was forever trying to establish her own name, and be herself not a shadow. Percy in the Spitfire Grill was trying to be herself, even though she wasn't a traditionalist like the locals and was having a hard time trying to establish herself from this pre-conceived idea that the locals had about her.This movie starts out showing Dottie as an older woman preparing to go to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, where they will recognize the Women in Baseball, and then the movie begins a flashback as Dottie remembers how she joined with her sister and how the first league was played. The movie had great bright lighting, and soft colors on the uniform and throughout while in the 40's. Other references were made that made it realistic for the time, like the woman radio announcer speaking about the women being drug from their homes and children to play baseball and she told Mr. Harvey that like your candy you are nuts. The rules that were enforced on the ladies that played baseball also represented the time that it was set in. The women were not allowed to smoke, have men around, and had to take classes on how to be more lady like. The movie did a good job of bringing in authentic time characteristics.This movie shows just one aspect of how the women in the 40's had to fill in for the men while they were away at war, but the plot of the movie really focused on the two sisters and their relationship.

Dottie doesn't want to leave home and play baseball she is happy at home waiting for her husband to return from the war, Kit on the other hand is very excited and anxious to leave home.The entire movie is about the focus on these two sisters and their differences. Kit is forever finding herself in her sister, Dottie's shadow, but Dottie doesn't care as much about the game as Kit does. Kit and Dottie find themselves on different teams because of the competition and family disputes, and face off in the World Series. The winning play comes down to Kit running for home base while Dottie tries to get Kit out, because Kit's determination of the game is stronger Kit slams into her sister and wins the game.The movie focuses on these two characters and their complex sibling relationship. The movie portrays Dottie as a better player than Kit but she doesn't have the heart for it, Dottie's only care is her husband and mentions a few times throughout the film that she just wants to be home with him. Kit has a drive to get away from her home, and to not be compared to her sister anymore. Even though Kit and Dottie see things differently the movie shows that siblings can have a complex relationship.This movie reminded me of the Spitfire Grill, a movie about a girl joining a family, she was perceived to be different and she was trying to earn their acceptance. Like the woman in the Spitfire Grill, Kit knew she was different than her sister and wasn't traditional like Dottie. Kit was forever trying to establish her own name, and be herself not a shadow. Percy in the Spitfire Grill was trying to be herself, even though she wasn't a traditionalist like the locals and was having a hard time trying to establish herself from this pre-conceived idea that the locals had about her.This movie starts out showing Dottie as an older woman preparing to go to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, where they will recognize the Women in Baseball, and then the movie begins a flashback as Dottie remembers how she joined with her sister and how the first league was played. The movie had great bright lighting, and soft colors on the uniform and throughout while in the 40's. Other references were made that made it realistic for the time, like the woman radio announcer speaking about the women being drug from their homes and children to play baseball and she told Mr. Harvey that like your candy you are nuts. The rules that were enforced on the ladies that played baseball also represented the time that it was set in. The women were not allowed to smoke, have men around, and had to take classes on how to be more lady like. The movie did a good job of bringing in authentic time characteristics.This movie shows just one aspect of how the women in the 40's had to fill in for the men while they were away at war, but the plot of the movie really focused on the two sisters and their relationship.

'The Cowboys' in particular, should almost be a rite of passage for young boys.i know a lot about family films. don't believe it? then just check some of my other reviews online. a lot of those are kids and family. don't know. just grew up that way reading a lot of standard children's classics and fairy tales. i never grew tired of them i guess. i must be young at heart or something.i've also pointed out to people all through my life, that really good family films outside of the Disney monopoly, are often hard to find. there are those, Jim Henson, 'Yellow Submarine', 'Little Nemo in Slumberland', 'Animal Farm', to name a few, that are just as good as any Disney product and offer an alternative to the Mickey Mouse think tank. 'True Grit' is one of those.a lot of people in the past always thought it strange when i've cited John Wayne's 'True Grit' and 'The Cowboys' as great family films. i guess they were taken aback by the Duke's toughness and, especially in the case of the Cowboys', the suggestion of too much violence. maybe so, but whoever said that kid's movies should be dull and tepid. a little injection of reality can't hurt a genre that is often rooted in fantasy and unreality. and there is more coming of age philosophy in these westerns than a lot of facile family fare.'True grit' might not be as great a western as say 'Rio Bravo' or 'The searchers', it's not even as good, maybe, as a contemporary western like Walter Hill's 'Long Riders', but it's a much better film and a deserving classic than a lot of critics usually regard it to be.Johnn Wayne is a great actor with a lot of presence and rugged toughness. instead of his usual tough guy ambiguity, his performance here is very tender and gun-loaded with lots of charm. not to mention suitably tough enough for the role. i have also always felt that Kim Darby was a very underrated and under-appreciated as an actress. i've loved a few films that Darby starred in, most notably Coppolla's wonderful sci fi mystery 'The people', and the ever scary and frightening 'Don't Be Afraid of The Dark'. two extremely memorable but underrated film classics.'True Grit' is underrated as a film western and long unidentified as a family classic. every kid should see it with their parents.one footnote here; DO NOT WATCH THIS ON AMC EVER. i was stupid enough to watch this on AMC and not only were the commercials terrible (like every five minutes), but they also butchered the film to fit the time slot. this is the last time i watch a movie on broadcast. i made the same mistake the other night with BET (another offender with commercials and editing hack jobs). it's not worth it. next time i watch a movie it'll be on NetFlix or a subscription channel. in this day and age when it is easy enough to see films uncut and in their entirety, i can't understand why anyone would still present movies this way.

The plot deviates greatly from its source material, the original short story by Stephen King, and the movie ends with what seems to be a hastily thrown together action-sequence, where our heroes battle 'He Who Walks Behind The Rows', the demon that inspired the children to slaughter their parents. Complete with very questionable special effects, poor dialogue and nonsensical biblical passages, it brings what has been a fairly fun and chilling ride to a less than interesting conclusion.This is the best one of the lot.
