I can imagine it would be like making a 16 year old sit through 2001. No zooming spaceships, no lasers, no action or fighting.I am vehemently opposed to most remakes.

Actually, when I first saw this movie, I did not know who any of the above were, I just thought that the adds in the cinema looked cool, hired the video, loved it, and finally ended up buying it. Last night when we watched it, we discussed about what memorable nineties comedies were. We concluded that Empire Records, Airheads, and Clueless would leave something very memorable. As for British Comedies, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. I need not say any more. Anyway, Airheads is about three guys who have written what they considered to be a really cool song, but none of the record companies want to hear it. So they try to get it played on the air after breaking into the radio station KBBL Rebel Radio. After an initial refusal, out come some very real looking water pistols. This movie, though seeming very shallow, is actually quite deep. The major theme in this movie is that music is not what we like, but what the record companies want to sell. This is clearly seen when they are in a nightclub watching a band called the Son's of Thunder, whom lost to their band, the Lone Rangers, at a battle of the bands, yet the Son's of Thunder received the contract. Just because music is good does not mean that the record companies are going to sell it. This movie is in fact very scathing of the record industry, and the entertainment industry in particular. They do not want to know this band until they hold up the radio station and gain so much publicity that they can see a lot of money. As such they snatch up the band in an instant, and try to get a contract signed before anybody else does. They are not interested in the song, they simply want the money that their publicity will bring. Chez is completely the opposite. He wants to do it for the music, and the lifestyle. Even though he wants the money, it is the music that's important, and what is more important is that they show their fans that they can play this music and it is not some lame act buy people that are loved playing a song that an unknown wrote. This is seen when Chez uses the contract as toilet paper after learning that it was written up without hearing the song. The other interesting part of this show is the scene where Chez's past is revealed. The SWAT officer tries to turn his popularity against him by revealing that he was a school nerd who played dungeons and dragons. The great thing about this scene is that after mulling over it for a bit, others began to own up to these secret desires, showing that it is not a thing that nerds simply do, and if you have done the things then who really cares anyway. What these guys want is somebody who is real, not some plastered statue created by the record companies to simply sell records. I love this movie. The humor is witty, but it goes beyond simple comedy to really bring out what the essence of music is. Music is what you enjoy, not something to make money. There are so many instances in this movie where this is brought out. Another scene is where Chez is going through the CDs and realises that most of them are not played because the radio station does not want to play them. In this movie we see the struggle between doing something for money and doing something for the love of it. Chez does this because he loves it while the station manager wants the money. If the owners tell him to change, he isn't going to argue because he wants the money and does not care about the music. We see that doing something simply for love in the ends wins people over, because not only do a whole heap of people rock up at the radio station to cheer them on, but people in the radio station take their side as well.

This time I cleared FOUR HOURS, taking into account all the little things that distract the viewer at home, and this time I actually got to the end and had some kind of a grip on what it was all about. Here are a couple of sentences about the film before I give you my thoughts.This is a film of five acts; I've called them Home, Hunting, Nam, Home Again and Nam Again. Others may divide it up differently, but that's how I see it. The story revolves around three guys; Michael, Steven and Nick, from a Pennsylvania steel town who go off to the Vietnam war full of hope and bravado. It deals with what happens to them there and the effects it has on both them and their loved ones back home. I won't go into specifics, but the effects of their experiences resonate deeply into the community they came from. I'll leave it there or the Spoiler Police will force me to play roulette with some Vietnamese gentlemen.First of all, great music throughout, not least the main theme performed by classical guitarist, John Williams. Also the film was beautifully shot by Director of Photography, Vilmos Zsigmond. Great performances all round, particularly from; Robert De Niro as Michael, Christopher Walken as Nick and John Savage as Steven. These three really carried off quite a performance! They were ably backed up by; John Cazale as Stan, Meryl Streep as Linda, George Dzundza as John and Chuck Aspegren as Axel.Putting aside the great performances, the cinematography and the music for a moment, I have to take a second to comment on the length of the piece. It is far too long; the first two acts take up nearly half the running time and do nothing to further the story that couldn't be done in thirty to forty minutes. The sequence in Vietnam could have been expanded, for instance, there is nothing that tells us just how they ended up in the situation they did (no spoilers I'm afraid). The later acts could have been dramatically shortened also. So I reckon about an hour could have been cut from this film and it would have been just as good, if not better. I am going to give it quite a decent score despite these misgivings because it is still a very powerful drama that I actually found quite compelling at times&#x85; Recommended (with reservations).My Score 7.5\/10.IMDb Score 8.2\/10 (based on 104,871 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score 91\/100 (based on 45 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

I've watched with many different people, and most of them liked it very much. If you like Johnny Depp, you'll recognize a favorite persona young, earnest, and without a clue -- and surprisingly dangerous.The thing about Jim Jarmusch is he has no particular interest in making Hollywood movies. I think he has influenced lots of more conventional Hollywood types, and today it is very common to see a Jarmusch riff popping up. American Beauty certainly comes to mind, but there have been many more. The typical Jarmusch character has no understanding of where they are or why they are there. Stranger than Paradise, his first generally available movie, sets the tone for these sorts of characters.Why is Dead Man a black and white movie? Nine million dollars is not a huge budget, but the days when color killed the budget are long since past. Jarmusch likes striking visual effects. In this movie it surely is all the bones. Think Georgia O'Keefe. Black and white is also an homage to the traditional western, and early movies in general. Many of the background characters, the one without speaking parts, have a certain wildness in their eyes that used to be a staple of the silent era and the thirties, but quickly disappeared after world war 2. Finally, I think the B&W simplified the editing. I think only Depp, Gary Farmer, and Lance Hendricksen were with Jarmusch for every day of shooting.Robbie Muller has made many Jarmusch movies. He is a wonderful camera man with many signature shots. His pans are often supposed to represent the character's gaze, and they always work. You will never know what happens before it happens, and Robbie Muller really makes that work.There is an opening sequence that will probably make or break the movie for you. Depp is on a train heading west. The train never changes; Depp never changes. But his fellow passengers get wilder and wilder. Suddenly Crispin Glover bursts in the car and delivers a weird vision. Part of it is a paradox; you see the shoreline moving, but really it is your boat bobbing up and down. That's pretty much how the train ride works, and how the movie works right through to the end.Never try to guess a meaning or a reference in a Jarmusch movie. For instance, you won't find out why Depp is named Bill Blake until Jarmusch wants you to. Apparently the movie is jam-packed with allusions to Blake's poetry, but you'll probably miss most of them. Maybe Jarmusch is trying to imagine the mind of William Blake; it is clear he is not interpreting Blake's poetic vision.I was glad to find out the 'Indian stuff' is not only based upon true features of the American Indian culture, but that real live American Indians like what Jarmusch does with their culture in this film.Most of the cameos are villains. Villainy gives actors lots of room to create a persona and take it somewhere in a hurry. Billy Bob Thornton and Iggy Pop are super, but so is Alfred Molina and Crispin Glover. And Robert Mitchum is ridiculously good.So it's a pretty great movie, as long as you don't worry too much about what it really is supposed to mean. The stupid white man is interpreted by the crazy Indian to be a re-incarnation of William Blake. Bill Blake probably doesn't even know who he is a namesake of the poet. His death is delayed because the crazy Indian needs it to be that way. Enjoy the ride.

The stupid white man is interpreted by the crazy Indian to be a re-incarnation of William Blake. Bill Blake probably doesn't even know who he is a namesake of the poet. His death is delayed because the crazy Indian needs it to be that way. Enjoy the ride.

Now the CK review After 30 min. watching it I hadn't fallen slept and had come instead to the conclusion stated in my title. This is all about Orson Wells; about how great filmmaker and great actor he is, to which effect he uses CFK as his privileged vehicle. And with him comes the territory, so to speak. From the initial scenes we are warned we are seriously in artsy territory here, there'll be no let up to the richness of camera movements; the exhaustive use and abuse of different kinds of lightning; the endless going back and forth through different time frames--manifested by the characters' ages--the blatant, self conscious, navel gazing of the main character (and actor) Great for the artsy, the film student, the rookie filmmaker, I reckon, but somewhat lame for people like me, who see fiction movie watching mostly as a form of entertainment.But even in technical terms I found CK contrived, artificial. Despite what its fans say, it has no character development, not even of CFK himself, even when the movie is about him. For ex. he's supposed to be influent socially and politically, yet we have no inkling of what is at stake--except his political future--in that struggle with Gettys because Wells never bothered to truly put him in his social context as an active participant. We never see him interacting with real, everyday people, just with sycophants, pairs, enemies, inside his corporative shell. Where is the POV of Regular Joe? And how his own relationship with his wife, son, evolved and deteriorated? Never know. All we see are headlines. Those talking about Wells' great acting job don't know what they are talking about; he didn't play Kane as a real person&#x97;letting him be--but only as a projection of himself, of his own ego, keeping him confined in an fully enclosed environment. He was even more controlling with CFK than CFK--or WRH--ever was. And that was the lead; as for the rest of the cast, they are just references; not even cardboard cuts&#x97;except for Susie, the only one with human face, real emotion there (I'll qualify my conclusion on Wells' Kane, but only assuming he hated WRH so much he just couldn't keep the necessary distance with his cinematographic alter ego).But the main problem of CK is that it doesn't have a plot. We know from the beginning that CFK will go up and then down in life. So what's left, if characters won't be the ones saving the day? How about mood, atmosphere? No luck there either as--something ironic--Wells kills all possibility of building such things, and getting tension, thrills expectations by the side, with his ever present obsession with artsy cinema. I can picture him too absorbed with camera angles, scene framing, lenses focusing, perspective searching, lightning setting and montage editing, to have any time for plot development, which he may even come to see as a drag. And all that kills the mood, the tension. At the end, the only real touching thing in the whole flick is the Susie subplot. (many people just don't get Comingore's Susie.

It is a detailed study of how moral horror (Nazism) slowly becomes acceptable through a culture of fear and suspicion and through propaganda. The movie presents propaganda in its most primitive form, and we are tempted to be shocked that young and otherwise decent Germans could fall for it, just as it is perhaps hard to believe that the authorities would get upset about swing music and that it could become a focus for political dissidence. First, propaganda is still with us today in other forms, as anyone who has heard the constant haranguing about heroes amongst us can attest. This film was set only a few years after the first use of cultural propaganda, and people were less cynical and more nationalistic than they are today, and perhaps less cynical and more apt to accept ideological positions like Nazism. The movie shows, here and there, that propaganda is effective even if we don't believe it, or don't believe most of it. Second, the movie is historically accurate as far as I can tell. Remember that concentration camps existed in 1939 (they had been invented by the British during the Boer war) as a sort of detention centre, but certainly not extermination camps, which were created in 1942. Imagine this situation today you hear some lout say, We should ship the n******* back to Africa. You dismiss it as a stupid, hateful comment. By 2014, there is a full scale State backed plan with millions of people being shipped away. My point is that in 1939 even the most rabid Nazi (except for the leadership) probably never imagined that it could happen. beating up Jews and dissidents were more or less normal at the time. Jews had been victims for centuries, and Germans have had difficulty tolerating dissent since the time of Martin Luther. This movie is good because it shows us how it could have and did come about, little by little and with the complacency and compliance of most people, who acted out of a combination of fear, ignorance and cupidity. For example, at several points characters make comments about the uniforms the Nazis gave their lower class followers, and how these seem to make them important and aggressive. This is a forgotten point, in today's prêt-à-jeter dominated clothing market, but back then no one had many clothes everyone had work clothes, one semi-good suit or frock for receiving people at home, and one good suit or outfit for Sundays and official functions. Uniforms, well, gave uniformity and crushed individuality, and the Nazis had swell ones, overall, that must have seemed pretty snazzy to most relatively poor Party followers (Nazis made a big deal of recruiting big names to their Party, but for the most part it was the anonymous lower middle classes that supported them). No one here was going to win an Oscar, but everyone was believable and decent. An unbilled Kenneth Branagh almost steals the show as the stereotypical but believable good German who happens to be a Nazi. Frank Whaley's crippled and idealistic swing kid and Django Reinhardt admirer Arvid also deserves kudos. His one big speech is a bit botched, but that's the fault of the histrionic writing style more apt for an after school special that lays out good and evil in simple terms. It's as if the script is good when it portrays the everyday banality of horror but is unable to denounce it without getting preachy and melodramatic. It's also fun to see today's well-known actors cutting their teeth on a pretty good story (with a few cheesy exceptions, like the ending) with nice period costumes and music, as well as Prague credibly substituting for Hamburg. Overall, if you're going to waste your time watching a meh and somewhat oddball movie, watch this one. Its pacing, acting, and design are all fine, as is the script, with the exceptions noted above.

By using this method, you do not need dialogue or narration to express the feeling of tension as Poole is stalked and killed by HAL9000. This also expresses the fact that Poole is alone and defenseless in the vastness of space.The end of this film is as visually stunning is it is cryptic. After Bowman investigates the giant monolith in the orbit of Jupiter, Bowman is drawn in and experiences several minutes of flashing lights and color. After Bowman is drawn into the monolith, there are several scenes in which he watches himself age, die and then become reborn. The ending of this film leaves much of the theme open for debate and forces us as viewers to come to our own conclusions in regards to the meaning of this film.

Having previously experienced action in Italy and North Africa, the close-knit squad sets out through areas still thick with Nazis. After they lose one man in a skirmish at a bombed village, some in the group begin to question the logic of losing more lives to save a single soldier. The film's historical consultant is Stephen E.

Ryan so i missed the beginning, the epic beginning but still there were some violent fights throughout the movie. i decided to watch this movie again today.yes this is one of the very best war movies, one of my all time favorites and one of the best movies ever made. i may not be able to call it the best war movie ever but i certainly will call it the most realistic depiction of war. this is another war movie from Steven Spielberg, but this time actual on field war. it is set during the invasion of Normandy in World War II. the film is a fiction account of four brothers, four sons of Agnes Allison of Port Carbon, Pennsylvania. The brothers were killed in the American Civil War but the writer decided to include that story into World War II scenario.the opening sequence has to be one of the most memorable sequences in the history of motion Picture, the intensity of those 27 minutes is indescribable in words, shocking, intense, chilling, realistic, gory, a torture in fact. it depicts the Omaha beachhead assault of June 6, 1944. after that, seven other men along with Capt.

They differed from their more ostentatious forebears not just in setting, but in a realistic and intimate approach that went with the new generation of filmmaking. A Man for All Seasons represents the subgenre at its peak.A Man for All Seasons is derived from a play by Robert Bolt, a name most familiar from the screenplays for David Lean's epics. It stands as one of his best works. He has these brilliantly succinct and engaging ways of introducing characters. When we first meet Thomas More, he has that exchange with his servant Matthew where he implies his knowledge that Matthew has sneaked a peak at the letter. It shows More's intelligence, but also his maturity, and in a way that also endears him to us. Similarly, the little moment when the king first appears, and he jumps in the mud, there is an awkward silence as his lackeys are unsure how to react, then they all laugh when the king laughs. It tells us everything we need to know about the king's character, and by extension the state of politics in the country at the time. All the way through characters are fully rounded and familiar, yet never clichéd. One of Bolt's biggest weaknesses in the Lean screenplays was an inability to write strong female characters The part of Alice More is an exception to this.The director is Fred Zinnemann. Zinnemann has, not exactly a documentary style as some have stated, but certainly a penchant for naturalism, frequently staging little acts that make logical sense without ever delving into the banality of protracted realism. For example, in the opening scene we see Leo McKern giving the paper a little shake to dry the ink &#x96; you wouldn't see anything so everyday in a 50s historical picture. A few shots later, and we see the messenger momentarily lose his balance as he leaps out of the boat. This aspect of normality, when coupled with the impressively authentic sets and costumes, seems to bring us incredibly close to the era depicted. Zinnemann's camera is wonderfully calm and meditative, with Spartan shot compositions that show us only what we need at any given moment. Every reaction shot has some meaning, and I'm not just talking about the close-ups. Sometimes they are further back (yet still noticeable) for a more subtle touch. I'm thinking for example of John Hurt's reaction when he hears that the cup he sold for fifty shillings was worth a hundred. Zinnemann's montages of carvings and monuments give context to the scenes that precede them without being too contrived in their symbolism. The shot of fluttering leaves and the sound of bird song that open the final scene create a really beautiful moment, a hint of undaunted nature carrying on regardless.And then of course there is the magnificent cast making all this work. Paul Schofield gives a nicely subdued performance, showing us not only More's calm demeanour but also a man smothering his true thoughts, smothering even his emotions, allowing them to break through to the surface just a little in the last few scenes, and even then doing so with breathtaking control. Wendy Hiller is similarly understated, yet always hinting at the potential fieriness of Alice's personality. When her character does give full vent to her feelings, Hiller does so with such power and such precision. Even in the smaller roles, the quality of someone like Colin Blakely (Matthew) is enough to make memorable his I wish we had wings outburst. The only performance I dislike is Robert Shaw's as the king, which is conspicuously theatrical. Presumably this was intentional, paralleling as it does portrayals of Nero and the like, but it's out of step with the realism of everything else. It's a pity it resulted in Shaw's only Oscar nomination because he did much better stuff that was not so recognized.The only other problem with A Man for All Seasons is that, for all the bravery and principle with which it is carried out, Thomas More's silence regards what boils down to little more than technicalities; a mere detail of religious bureaucracy. What's more both the political and even the religious arguments against it seem fairly sensible. To my mind it somewhat blunts the presentation of More as a man of logic and shrewdness.

It starts with a judge explaining to a jury of 12 men that the only way to come to a decision of guilty is to not have any room for reasonable doubt. The judge then goes on to say if the jurors find the defendant guilty, the guilty verdict will automatically impose the death penalty. The 12 men then go to a jury room to deliberate, which is where the whole movie takes place. The defendant is a teenager accused of stabbing his father to death, with a switch blade knife. All but 1 (Davis, played by Henry Fonda) of the 12 men find the defendant guilty, immediately, without any discussion to the arguments heard during the trial. The theme for this film is justice. Eleven men were ready to sentence a teenage boy to death without even analyzing the information presented before them. For some, it seemed their verdict was for personal reasons and Davis (juror # 8) was not going to conform to the majority. The men were mean, hostile, demanding, stereotypical, rude, and impatient, but Davis didn't break. Davis went through many of the testimonials from witnesses, even acting out scenarios for the other men to get a better understanding of how he could not convict the boy, also putting doubt in the other 11 men. The men one by one started to change their votes because or Davis's analysis . The first juror to change his vote from guilty to not guilty was juror # 9, who was later identified as Mr. McCardle at the end of the movie. After many more discussions and possibilities, juror #5 changed his vote to not guilty, followed (in order) by juror # 11, juror #2, juror #6, juror #7, juror #12, juror #1 (the Foreman), juror #10, juror #4, and finally juror #3.

An example of Davis making his point includes the fact that humans can mistake things sometimes, and if it was possible that at least one of the witnesses made a mistake in what they heard or saw, they should not find this young man guilty, and if so, no justice will be served. Another movie that has justice as the theme is The Accused (1988), starring Jodie Foster and Kelly McGillis. Jodie Foster's character is gang-raped and her lawyers job is to convince a jury that this crime has actually committed by these men, and this was not consensual sex. There too were witnesses in this movie and it was also up to the jury to decide if the witness's story was credible and true. Although the opposite of 12 Angry Men (1957) because in The accused (1988), the main character was trying to convince people that a crime had been committed by a group of men for sure, and in 12 Angry Men (1957) the main character was trying to convince people that maybe they had the wrong guy. Yet, both themes for each movie was justice. The move 12 Angry men (1957) was shot in black and white. I believe this movie was filmed this way because during that time period (1957) black and white films were standard. Color television had only been introduced a few years before. Black and white also gives the viewer the option to better focus on the characters, and dialogue, and not what is surrounding. I liked how the camera would zoom into whichever juror would suddenly have doubt and change their vote. During these moments there was no need for dialogue really because after Davis gave another possibility, we knew that another juror would change their guilty verdict to a not guilty verdict during the next vote.

I also had to put myself in the position of Davis; trying to convince these men that there is absolutely room for doubt when you analyze the evidence, whether the boy committed the crime or not, there was not enough evidence to say guilty.

We even get Sidney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre, along with S.Z. Sakall.The typical movie is boy meets girls, boy loses girl, boy gets her back. In this version, Rick has already lost Ilsa, he gets her back, then he gives her up for the greater glory of France. Well, okay not France but for democracy and all that's decent. The dialogue is excellent with more memorable lines in each minute than most other movies generate in the whole show.Sigh - they all come rushing back Round up the usual suspects! Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so. 'I came to Casablanca for the waters.' 'It's a desert - there are no waters.' 'I was misinformed.' Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.The movie presents Rick as a cynical egoist, interested only in preserving himself. But we learn from his dossier that he's been involved with freedom fighters in several countries, then we learn of Ilsa. We decide that Rick is a cynic because she broke his heart, and he thinks he was a sap. Cynicism is a shell. Ilsa walks into his gin joint and back into his life, and Rick's shell thickens before our eyes. Of course, as the movie goes on, we see his shell melt away, and Rick emerges as the hero we knew was hidden deep inside all along. The dialogue is excellent, and so is the directing (Michael Curtiz). Casablanca is full of minor characters who add to the richness of the world Rick lives in, adding depth that his character hides. Through his interactions with them, their affection for him and his gruffness toward them, we see his cynicism for the shell it is. Inside that steel exterior beats a heart of concrete.The ending is superb, melodramatic, and heartbreaking without being maudlin and tearjerking. Noble, but not overdone, maintaining the breeziness and snappy dialogue in the face of Nazi jackboots. (Okay, so jackboots don't have faces, but you get the point, see.)Everything works. It all comes together and stays together throughout the whole movie.*I call Casablanca a movie because it's a great romantic movie about a guy and a girl. I call The Dresser a film because it's about marvelous characters, and we get to watch their development during the film; The Dresser is art on a high level. The Princess Bride -- I dunno where it fits. It's just my favorite fantasy epic swashbuckler that rises so far above whatever genre it is that it doesn't fit anywhere.

This is NOT a revenge movie. Anyone calling it that has not seen it. True, one of the women has been raped, but she doesn't seem to care, nor does she want revenge. The other woman who joins her simply wants excitement. If you have to compare this to an American film, try Natural Born Killers. That is closer in tone and theme than Thelma & Louise because there is nothing to like about these characters. They are cold-blooded, merciless killers who go on a rampage and enjoy murdering and having sex. Sometimes they kill the people they have sex with; other times they don't. But the bottom line is that this is truly bad filmmaking. It looks like something made by a pair of high school dropouts with no idea what the point of their film is. It is shot on video (not film), features adult film actresses, unrealistic violence, and has no impact. About half-way through, you may ask yourself why it was made. It really goes nowhere. Even if was a revenge film, it still wouldn't have been any good, because of the poor acting, poor production value and the fact that the first-time directors just haven't sharpened their talent yet. Who is the target audience for this? A porno audience? The horror film audience? It doesn't hit the mark in either genre. Who cares about the explicit sex and violence if it's so poorly made that you can't take it seriously? That is definitely the case with Baise-moi.
