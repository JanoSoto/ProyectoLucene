I can't see how anyone cannot appreciate this movie for what it is.

I would love to know what movie these people think tops this one in the horror genre.  Would it be Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, Halloween, or the countless other movies of the same ilk???  These are all movies that follow the exact same plotline...a bunch of teenagers get drunk, have sex, get killed, then one lone survivor outlasts the baddie and somehow beats him in the end only to have him respawn in the next movie.

The movie actually has a story to tell, so that means there are going to be times in the movie where plot progression takes precedent over all out gore.  The movie actually wants you to *gasp* think...about the battle between good and evil (both in the world and in the minds and hearts of the characters)and the conflict of faith and science in modern times.

I seriously don't know, because that must be one of the most neutral titles of the 90's. Well, let me tell you that this shouldn't be an indicator. Gattaca is worth at least one viewing and comes with a small recommendation of mine. It's a highly intelligent story with fairly good acting performances and directing. The story picks in on modern evolutions and that's why it's fascinating enough to keep you interested. Though it is still an exaggerated look towards the future, you fear it could be a possible scenario from time to time. That's probably the the best aspect about the whole movie. Other than most science fiction films, you feel more involved.SPOILERS AHOY !!.... In a ( and I quote ) not-too-distant-future ( I love that description ) people are no longer judged on their skin-color. Nor are they being judged on their intelligence, social background or past !! A perfect world without racism and discrimination, you say ? Think again. It's all a matter on your genes now. Normal people like you and me, who're a result of love between 2 people have no chances in this world anymore. They're too sensitive for diseases, heart-failures and overall the life expectation is very low. The ideal son or daughter now is something that you can compose yourself. Perfect in every possible way. Vincent ( Ethan Hawke ) is one of those old fashioned God's babies. He dreams about going into outer space but he totally isn't qualified to do so. Therefore he makes a deal with a handicapted überhuman ( Jude Law ). They switch lives so that Vincent can make his dream come true and Jerome can keep up his way of living. Things are going perfect until one of the project leaders is killed. With modern ways of investigation the murderer doesn't stand a chance to get away with it and the credibility of Vincent becomes doubtful all of a sudden. Especially when the investigating cop is Vincent's genetic engineered brother...END SPOILERS !!!As you can see, a very promising plot idea. I'll be the last to say that this movie is bad but it surely has many negative aspects and flaws. I can appreciate movies that are mainly story-driven but this one could have used a bit more action.

The small roles of Tony Shalhoub and especially Ernest Borgnine are surely worth a mentioning as well.  I suppose the rather large dose of sentiment in Gattaca was inevitable but still, it's rather annoying...that final swim test for example was way to fake in my opinion.

A ridiculous plot line with an almost laughable premises presents itself, and despite the far-fetched idea I found myself surrendering to the film's incredibly charm, kicking back and enjoying the onscreen mayhem.  Joe Dante brings an oddball twist of horror and loony toons-inspired comedy by making little demonic creatures have interestingly violent, yet quirky, personalities.  The gremlins hold a place as my favorite movie monsters of all time.  The real stars of the movie are Gizmo and the Gremlins (sorry Zack, Phoebe) compliments of Chris Wallas and his creature effects crew who did a spectacular job bringing the puppets to life especially in the pre-CGI age.  Watching Gremlins for the first time in years, now in the middle of the CGI age, I can honestly say I miss the days of puppets.  CGI is great for a lot of things, and CGI makes many tasks easier . . . but characters entirely done with CGI lacks the concreteness of the Gremlins puppets.  Sometimes the work is much more difficult, but I think it's worth it. I love it when the Gremlins mimic the human characters around them in speech and actions, when they perform some act of cruelty and top it off with their silly and over-the-top maniacal laughter, somehow these little demons, while terrible and viscous, take on a lovable quality to them.  They have a nice satirical edge to their personality that makes the Gremlins surpass so many creatures born into the horror genre and quickly forgotten.  And who can forget the bouncy Gremlins theme music compliments of the immensely talented Jerry Goldsmith.    Another thing I love about Gremlins is the surreal nature to everything.  The characters never quite seem real, the sets never quite look like a real place, the narration, the whole atmosphere of the town has a weird goofball fairy tale quality to it . . . but in no way is that a complaint or criticism.  Gremlins never really sets out to take place in your home town and happen to the guy next door to you, and I'm glad it doesn't.

The local library has been carrying more videotapes and DVDs now and Rebel Without a Cause caught my eye.I have always heard of the legendary James Dean but never was moved enough to watch one of his movies, so this was a perfect opportunity.I won't go into the plot synopsis as others have done a good job on that. All I will say is that I was sorely disappointed watching the movie given all the acclaim it and James Dean came with.Maybe it's the feel of the whole movie overall -- I've seen a number of other '50s movies and their actors didn't exactly chew up the scenery like many of these over-the-top performances did.  Maybe these actors and actresses in Rebel were directed by Nicholas Ray to do that to get the feeling across to the audience of that wayward intensity these bad kids and their parents all had.  Maybe, but to me, it just seemed to make the movie that much more cartoonish and caricaturish, careening from one extreme to another, back and forth, like a ride in one of those softly sprung '50s jalopies you see in the movie.Anyway, it was a chance to see the legendary James Dean on screen.  I have to admit that no other actor readily comes to mind who can so instantaneously screw up his face and go into that almost tortured and conflicted wailing soul sort of performance.  It was very melodramatic -- maybe that's the appeal of James Dean. Here's a handsome young guy, who could be tough, but at the same time show that he is so sensitive through his extreme emotional outbursts.Interesting talent to be able to and comfortable enough to do that for one's screen persona, but it's not something that would make him an acting legend for the ages in my book.  (Not having seen his other movies, I will leave that judgment open for the benefit of the doubt.)I agree with the other poster who said that if it wasn't for the tragic ending to his short life and career, James Dean may not have enjoyed the status he seems to have.  On the other hand though, there are a few times even in this somewhat lame movie, that in a certain shot or close-up, James Dean does evoke what Clint Eastwood ended up becoming.However, all-in-all, I found this movie disappointing given all the hype.

All I will say is that I was sorely disappointed watching the movie given all the acclaim it and James Dean came with.Maybe it's the feel of the whole movie overall -- I've seen a number of other '50s movies and their actors didn't exactly chew up the scenery like many of these over-the-top performances did.  Maybe these actors and actresses in Rebel were directed by Nicholas Ray to do that to get the feeling across to the audience of that wayward intensity these bad kids and their parents all had.  Maybe, but to me, it just seemed to make the movie that much more cartoonish and caricaturish, careening from one extreme to another, back and forth, like a ride in one of those softly sprung '50s jalopies you see in the movie.Anyway, it was a chance to see the legendary James Dean on screen.  I have to admit that no other actor readily comes to mind who can so instantaneously screw up his face and go into that almost tortured and conflicted wailing soul sort of performance.  It was very melodramatic -- maybe that's the appeal of James Dean. Here's a handsome young guy, who could be tough, but at the same time show that he is so sensitive through his extreme emotional outbursts.Interesting talent to be able to and comfortable enough to do that for one's screen persona, but it's not something that would make him an acting legend for the ages in my book.

On the other hand though, there are a few times even in this somewhat lame movie, that in a certain shot or close-up, James Dean does evoke what Clint Eastwood ended up becoming.However, all-in-all, I found this movie disappointing given all the hype.

Say hello to my little friend! - Tony Montana, a.k.a. Scarface.Scarface chronicles the life of a Cuban refugee who came to America in May, 1980, when Fidel Castro opened the harbor at Mariel Bay, Cuba, with the apparent intention of letting some of his people join their families back in America. As the movie's opening intro explains, it soon became obvious that Castro was doing little more than sending the scum of Cuba to America in hopes of ridding his domain of filth. Of the 125,000 Cubans who came to America that year, an estimated 25,000 had criminal backgrounds.Antonio Montana (Al Pacino) was one of those criminals who came to America from Cuba and successfully set up his own kingdom of cocaine, wealth and greed. We see him in the first few minutes of the film being interviewed by police regarding his background. He's asked about the scar that stretches from his eyebrow down to his cheek. He gives all the right responses and is sent off to a quarantine camp along with his long-time friend, Manny (Steven Bauer). After murdering a man in the camp as a favor for a Mafia kingpin named Frank (Robert Loggia), the two buddies are given green cards and released from the camp. Eventually they land another job for Frank. Their wealth and greed starts to grow.Every time we see Tony Montana he is a bit better off. Better clothes, better means of transportation. He visits his mother at her small little home in Miami to show off his fortune. He tries to give her money but she says that people like him give bad names to the hard-working Cubans (like herself) who have come to America and work legitimately for a living.But Tony's sister, Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) doesn't think so. She adores her brother and accepts 1,000 dollars from him as a present. But it backfires--soon Gina is hanging out in the fancy clubs and getting felt up by men. Tony sees this and anger lights up in his eyes like fire. This happens twice in the movie. Both times are in regards to his sister. Manny explains to Gina that Tony doesn't want her to turn out like him because she is the only thing pure left in his life.Soon Tony is so powerful that he overthrows Frank and marries his girl (Michelle Pfeiffer), who becomes so depressed that she sleeps all day and snorts all night. Nothing exceeds like excess. You should know that, Tony.Scarface is based on Howard Hawks' 1932 film of the same title that starred Paul Muni as the title character. Both movies were accused of being overly violent. Both characters from the films had a strange infatuation with their sisters. Both characters fell in love with their boss' girlfriend. But the similarities end there. The 1932 version was not about a Cuban, it was not about an empire built on drugs, and it was not very similar by any account. Al Pacino said that Muni's performance inspired him to become Tony Montana. And while some critics accuse Pacino's performance of being over the top and too flamboyant, think about this His character is a Cuban refugee who came to America and killed people for a living before taking over an empire built on drugs and crime. He lives in fear of not only others but himself. As his life proceeds he snorts cocaine so often that he can barely think. Then he has the underlying guilt of his life bearing down on his shoulders. How over the top would you act?The movie was written by Oliver Stone, who completed a final draft after many attempts by other writers, including one attempt by the director of the movie, Brian DePalma, who claims that his script was not going the way he wanted it to go. Stone made the story his, and succeeds on almost all levels of storytelling. Back when Scarface was released drugs, violence and big blowouts at the end of a movie were hardly run-o'-the-mill. The 160 + F-words in the film were not exactly standard, either. But the story is involving and sad. It is the best film about the American Dream ever made. Tony Montana wanted the world, and when he finally got what he wanted, he realized that even the world was not enough. Perhaps the best and most important scene in Scarface is the subtlest one--when Tony is sitting at his desk after he has killed Manny. He has everything he ever dreamed about and wanted in front of him--drugs, drinks, a luxurious mansion, a beautiful wife. Yet it isn't enough for him. And the reason he sits there in silence for so long is because it is then that he realizes happiness does not come from material wealth, but from the inside. And, to be honest, Tony Montana doesn't really have much of a soul inside. And he knows it.Scarface opens with its own theme song and closes with it, as well. It is more than just coincidence--when it is played in the beginning of the movie, it is during the time of Mariel Bay, and hope is everywhere for criminals. When it plays at the end, we have witnessed the American Dream from start to finish. When it plays at the end, there is no hope left for anyone.5\/5.- John Ulmer ","genre":null},{"date":"16 October 2003","score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":"  You wanna play rough?

Both movies were accused of being overly violent. Both characters from the films had a strange infatuation with their sisters. Both characters fell in love with their boss' girlfriend. But the similarities end there. The 1932 version was not about a Cuban, it was not about an empire built on drugs, and it was not very similar by any account. Al Pacino said that Muni's performance inspired him to become Tony Montana. And while some critics accuse Pacino's performance of being over the top and too flamboyant, think about this His character is a Cuban refugee who came to America and killed people for a living before taking over an empire built on drugs and crime. He lives in fear of not only others but himself. As his life proceeds he snorts cocaine so often that he can barely think. Then he has the underlying guilt of his life bearing down on his shoulders. How over the top would you act?The movie was written by Oliver Stone, who completed a final draft after many attempts by other writers, including one attempt by the director of the movie, Brian DePalma, who claims that his script was not going the way he wanted it to go. Stone made the story his, and succeeds on almost all levels of storytelling. Back when Scarface was released drugs, violence and big blowouts at the end of a movie were hardly run-o'-the-mill. The 160 + F-words in the film were not exactly standard, either. But the story is involving and sad. It is the best film about the American Dream ever made. Tony Montana wanted the world, and when he finally got what he wanted, he realized that even the world was not enough. Perhaps the best and most important scene in Scarface is the subtlest one--when Tony is sitting at his desk after he has killed Manny. He has everything he ever dreamed about and wanted in front of him--drugs, drinks, a luxurious mansion, a beautiful wife. Yet it isn't enough for him. And the reason he sits there in silence for so long is because it is then that he realizes happiness does not come from material wealth, but from the inside. And, to be honest, Tony Montana doesn't really have much of a soul inside. And he knows it.Scarface opens with its own theme song and closes with it, as well. It is more than just coincidence--when it is played in the beginning of the movie, it is during the time of Mariel Bay, and hope is everywhere for criminals. When it plays at the end, we have witnessed the American Dream from start to finish. When it plays at the end, there is no hope left for anyone.5\/5.- John Ulmer ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"16 October 2003","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  SPOILER ALERT!

Halloween II is a cold, dark and bloody slasher pic, much more violent than the original. Halloween III is a bold attempt to take the series in a new direction. Halloween 5 has a terrific visual style. The Curse of Michael Myers is (as released in its theatrical version) a butchered near-masterpiece. H20 brings quality back to the franchise. And so on and so forth. With the Halloweens, I take 'em all for what they are, and like 'em all. Except for Resurrection, since all it is is an unmitigated disaster. It's a movie so awesomely inept as to make, I don't know, The Return of Michael Myers look like The Exorcist. **SPOILERS** The explanation for how a beheaded Michael survived H20 is laughable. There's a nauseating couple of scenes at the beginning in which the myth of Michael Myers is tied in to the stories of real life serial killers (which must make fun viewing for their victims' relatives and friends, hey?). Busta Rhymes makes just about the worst lead imaginable for a Halloween movie. Michael isn't remotely frightening. The film boasts not a single shock, and not a single moment of suspense (this is a picture in which the heroine is alerted to Michael's presence behind her by an e-mail message on her palm pilot, sent by a dorky kid at a Halloween party who's dressed as Vincent Vega from Pulp Fiction, *yawn*, how clever, how very, very far we've come from Haddonfield, 1978, and how very, very not worth it it all is).

Resurrection at times almost seems like merely the pilot for a franchise starring Busta Rhymes as a businessman cum rapper cum kung fu guru who walks the earth to fight evil. Great.

The story is pretty simple and has been done before but the script is superb and all the actors are at the height of their powers.  Brando is unbelievable as Malloy--he portrays his innocence and hurt so easily--I actually started to get a lump in my throat when he comes to grips about the corruption.

Denzel Washington is serving a prison sentence for killing his wife in a domestic dispute. While away, his son has grown to become high school basketball stand-out Ray Allen (a real-life NBA player). Governor Ned Beatty promises to shorten Washington's sentence if he can convince Allen to attend Beatty's alma mater. He has one week to accomplish his goal. Naturally Allen is outraged by seeing his father again and creates a shell to keep Washington out of his life. At first this seems like a good thing, but what if all of Allen's so-called friends (coaches, relatives, girls, agents and fans) are the true antagonists here and Washington is the flawed hero? Lee is never sure what he wants to do here. The movie plays out like a chaotic basketball game with lots of action and memorable action, but in the end you do not want either team to win. Washington and Allen's relationship takes up some airtime, but so do others that leave almost as fast as they appear. The corruption in collegiate athletics and within sports agencies is also given an interesting glimpse, but alas those topics are not explored completely. He Got Game looked like it would match the brilliance of William Friedkin's Blue Chips (a flawed, but important movie), but just does not seem to have the coaching necessary. Washington is impressive and handles the material as well as he can. Allen is a complete revelation. Anfernee Hardaway had stolen the show from Nick Nolte in Blue Chips and Allen pretty much does the same thing in this one. Ray Allen seems to have unlimited potential in front of the camera and his gift could be developed more fully after his playing career ends. I have said for years that Ray Allen should be the best player in the NBA, but he has ultimately disappointed me throughout his professional career. Allen is not the problem here though. Lee's sporadic direction and a meandering script end up sending He Got Game to the locker room way too soon. 2.5 out of 5 stars.

Eckhart, his intentions somewhat unclear, begins tedious research with the help of expert Gwyneth Paltrow and soon a heartbreaking love story starts between Northam and Ehle via intense flashbacks. It appears that Eckhart is out to make a name for himself, but all that almost immediately takes a backseat as he starts to realize just how personal and passionate the past relationship was. And soon he finds that perhaps he could find love with Paltrow in the process. During the flashbacks the fact that Northam was married to a loving wife (Holly Arid) and that Ehle had a lover of her own (Lena Headey) only adds to the tragedy. Northam and Headey had a platonic marriage though and Ehle obviously finally found her one true love in him. The affair leads to what could be described as silent fireworks as the major players (past and present) are all affected in one way or another. Co-writer\/director Neil LaBute (who hit a grand slam in his film-making debut with In the Company of Men, probably one of the best films of recent memory that no one has heard about) chooses a very strange topic here and nearly pulls off a truly emotional and exceptional experience. I must admit I think the flashbacks are excellent. Northam does probably the best work of his career and Ehle matches his brilliance step-for-step. With that said, Possession fails in the present-day of its story. Gwyneth Paltrow (probably the most over-rated actress today) and Aaron Eckhart just generate no chemistry between them. They end up going through a sometimes tiring Hardy Boys routine and I found myself constantly wishing that the film would go back to the Northam and Ehle characters. Honestly I think the movie would have been a masterpiece if the old affair was the only focus. Paltrow is annoying, as usual, and Eckhart (who was really good in The Company of Men and Erin Brockovich) just seems somewhat miscast here. By its end Possession will leave you with so many emotions, many good and bad. The ending is exceptional and I was nearly completely sold on the production by that point, but I just could not get over how uneven the film was when it went back to its present day.
