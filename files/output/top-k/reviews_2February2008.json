[{"date":"2 February 2008","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Based on the poem 'The Iron Man' by Ted Hughes, Brad Bird's first feature length movie, The Iron Giant, tells the story of a huge alien robot who crashes to Earth, where he is befriended by a young boy named Hogarth, but also pursued by a paranoid US government agent.Hogarth proceeds to teach his newfound metal pal about the wonders of life, the tragedy of death, the difference between good and evil, the joys of dive-bombing into water, and the all important moral 'we are who we choose to be'. However, when the boy innocently aims his toy gun at the massive mechanoid, the robot's true purpose is revealed he is a walking array of extraterrestrial fire-power programmed to respond to aggression. And with the army on its way to apprehend the giant, it looks like the proverbial is about to hit the fan.Will the robot destroy his enemy with a series of high powered energy blasts from his in-built armoury? Or will he choose to fight his basic programming and become a hero?Featuring breath-taking CGI-enhanced animation, flawless direction, and a script that brilliantly and intelligently mixes comedy, action and drama in equal doses, The Iron Giant is an unmissable treat for all ages.In true kids' movie tradition, the story has several important messages to tell and a couple of tear-jerker scenes, but it thankfully never resorts to the heavy-handed moralising and saccharine sweet schmaltz of many an animated feature. Instead, Bird delicately handles his themes of anti-violence, freedom of choice, life and death, and sacrifice for those you love. And he does this without once feeling the need for a song and dance number. Nice one, Brad!The film also succeeds in feeling very 'real', despite its fantastical premise. This is undoubtedly down to the well developed and likable characters (brilliantly voiced by a talented cast) and the incredible attention to detail in the animation, which not only includes loads of authentic 50s design, but also throws in some great references to the sci-fi movies and comics of the time.If the majority of animated features of the past few years have left you less than impressed, do yourself a favour and track down The Iron Giant. Charming, exciting, and ultimately uplifting, it's a film that'll leave you grinning from ear to ear.

In Witness for the Prosecution, based on an Agatha Christie story and popular stage play, Sir Wilfred (Charles Laughton) is referring to his personal nurse and attendant, the chirpy and determined Miss Plimsoll (Elsa Lanchester). Sir Wilfred has strict instructions to give up everything he holds dearest, namely brandy, cigars and the excitement of criminal defense cases. Nurse Plimsoll is there to see that he does, as well as to give him his injections, make sure he swallows his pills and tuck him in for his afternoon naps. In an effort to sneak a cigar that first day back in his office, Sir Wilfred finds himself intrigued by the case of Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power). Vole is a charming, too charming, man whom we don't quite trust. He has been charged with murdering a rich, silly woman...who coincidentally changed her will in Vole's favor a week before her death. Vole stands to become a very wealthy man. There is means, motive and opportunity, and for Sir Wilfred, there is a challenge. Vole swears he's innocent, but his story is not altogether plausible. His only hope, and a shaky one it is, is the testimony of his German wife, Christine (Marlene Dietrich). She has supplied an alibi, which cannot be verified, but at least she cannot be forced to testify against her husband. Then, when the marriage is found to be invalid, who should decide to become a witness for the prosecution? Sir Wilfred is mortified but even more determined to save his client. The case, full of startling twists, legal shenanigans, first-rate performances and vivid characters, ends with a typically Agatha Christie surprise. Some argue that Christie perhaps was weak as a writer, but peerless as a storyteller, able to construct mystery plot puzzles that consistently stumped her readers until the last chapter. With Billy Wilder directing and Wilder and Harry Kurnitz, an old pro, providing the screenplay, Christie once again gives a surprise twist that leaves us open-mouthed, yet smiling at her cleverness. Thanks to Wilder and Kurnitz, we also have a conclusion that involves Sir Wilfred and Nurse Plimsoll that is immensely satisfying. If only there had been a sequel. The four leads do marvelous jobs. In a way, the movie is about two relationships, not just one. There is the relationship between Vole and his wife. They met when Vole was a sergeant stationed in Germany right after WWII. He met Christine when she was earning money entertaining in a dive for soldiers. We see some of this in flashback. With Vole's opportunistic charm and Christine's cool manner, it's difficult to determine who, if either of them, is using whom, or to what degree love enters the picture. Christine's first entrance is memorable. Says Sir Wilfred to a group of fellows awaiting Mrs. Vole, Be prepared for hysterics and even a fainting spell. Better have smelling salts handy and a nip of brandy. Then in walks Marlene Dietrich as Christine Vole, with perfect assurance. I do not think that will be necessary, she says to Sir Wilfred. I never faint because I am not sure that I will fall gracefully and I never use smelling salts because they puff up the eyes. I am Christine Vole. In the second relationship, Sir Wilfred and Nurse Plimsoll provide the acerbic and mutually bullying comic relief for the movie. The two actors, however, married in real life, manage to develop a touching inter-dependence. It's not just a smile they give as at the end, but also a modest lump in the throat. And personally, I was delighted to see Henry Daniell in a substantial secondary role. He plays Mayhew, the solicitor who brings Vole to Sir Wilfred. Daniell could look like he was sneering with disdain even if he was just admiring the view. He played some wonderfully upper-class cads and villains in a lot of so-so movies. He also was a first-rate actor, who, given the chance, could also play serious, concerned men, the kind you wouldn't mind having for a friend. He does a fine job here.

The Mosquito Coast (86) was a complete miscalculation and Dead Poets Society (89) a shameful waste that self-destructed at the last. And Green Card I have not even bothered with. Go back before '85 however and his films get better and better. Picnic at Hanging Rock (75) and Gallipoli (81) both demonstrated Weir's ability to totally involve an audience with the simplest of themes and the most 'human' of characters. The Year of Living Dangerously was yet another credit to this insightful director, a top rate drama with a distinct thriller element.Mel Gibson plays Australian Broadcasting Service reporter Guy Hamilton, an ambitious young Aussie who has landed the arguably enviable position of Jakarta correspondent. What with the rebel communists planning a military coup, Indonesia in 1965 was not the safest place to be.Chinese-Australian photographer Billy Kwan (Linda Hunt) takes a shining to Guy and so goes out of his way to help the enthusiastic journo make a name for himself, and a few friends as well. One of those friends is English diplomat Jill Bryant (Sigourney Weaver), and before long romance begins to complicate matters.Our Mr. Weir blends the human drama with the political turmoil in seamless fashion, whilst importantly focusing on the people whose lives these events affect.

A werewolf starts killing off people because he in his human form knows that the people will kill themselves if he doesn't,which is a nice twist. The movie is generally eerie probably because Stephen King was the writer of the book this film is based off.Where as I have never seen the movie on TV, except HBO, I would expect it to be a movie on the Sci-Fi channel on a Saturday. If you ever have the chance to see or buy this movie, take it, you wont be disappointed, much.

Nothing less than brilliant! The film captures the political mood of Hollywood at that time. The two main characters were interesting throughout. The ending is by far the saddest I have ever seen in any film, having two daughters myself, both very much Daddy's girls, I cry every time I watch the last scene. After they split, as he's based in Hollywood, she in NY, they decide best he doesn't see his daughter, to allow Katie's new husband to be her dad. In a chance meeting on a NY street..., 'She's beautiful, Hubble, you'd be so proud, you'll see her when you come for that drink.' 'I...I...I can't, Katie...I can't....you know I can't come...is he a good father?' 'Yes, Hubble, he's a good father, a very good father.'..........' Take care, Katie' 'And you, Hubble.....' He walks away, the music starts up again.... The End. I'm welling up now, just thinking about it!!
