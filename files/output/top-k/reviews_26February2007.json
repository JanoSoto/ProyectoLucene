None of the actors show a real sense or clue on what lifestyle was all about at that time.They seem way, way too modern. Their characters have contemporery feel that is totally out of place for the era.Not really too much you can say about them, except that they are very shallow and very, very boring.. Then there are the events themself, which almost seem like an afterthought. The planes fly in, bomb their targets and escape while we are caught with our pants down. The much ballyhooed air raid sequence looks more like a video gamoe or a sequence from Star Wars with all the CGI effects looking exactly like what they are. And how 'bout the part where FDR miraculously rises out of his wheelchair on his own? I'm surprised there wasn't a haleullah chorus and praise the Lord after that!There are so many anachronisms in this film that you can drive the proverbial Mack truck through them.

This turns out not to be so bad after all&#151;at least, not for the audience. Because now, Esme gets to take center stage and have her own movie with the little pig. And that's great because she is a bubbly, fun character. She's lively, feisty, motherly, aggressive, honest, righteous, a little gullible, and sweet. She sets out with Babe to save the farm from the bank but unfortunately, they never even reach their destination&#151;and all the action plays out in a strange city where they're stranded and forced to find a place to stay. Babe gets mixed up with a variety of city animals, some much more pleasant than others, and through all of their escapades, scary, sad, or otherwise, he ultimately winds up teaching the whole lot of them the lessons about simple kindness and courage that we know Babe is already famous for. He brings everyone together with his cute piggy power and by the end, heals both the hurting farm back home and the worlds of those living in the cold and dangerous city. And for those willing to look, the messages of this whimsical, strange film go even deeper.There are far fewer human characters than animals, but they too are well worth meeting. Esme befriends the slightly eccentric young woman who owns the only hotel around this whole insensitive city that welcomes animals. She's a thin, nervous, timid girl with a tender heart, who cares for her mysterious Uncle Fugly (in the Big Five personality types, I figure her for a definite RLOAN and Esme likely an SLUAI.) All we really know about *him* is that he has a troupe of performing monkeys and he entertains ill children as a clown&#151;he also has a speech problem and his niece is the only one who can understand his mumbles. Kind of like Kenny. (I half expect someone to say to Babe, OMG! You killed Fugly! You -------!) His death comes before we find out much more, but it is a pretty pivotal event. BTW, I've noticed so many errors in these reviews from people who obviously saw the film once, didn't pay careful enough attention, and forgot or messed up details. Like, why is there a question of whether Fugly dies or not--don't you remember his niece saying ...my Uncle Fugly on his deathbed? There ya go.At any rate, the film only has one true villain&#151;Hortense, the nasty lady who lives across the street from the hotel and is responsible for having all the strays Babe's brought in for sanctuary taken away in a very cruel manner. The landlady had tried to create a safe haven for animals and friends, but ultimately found that she could not do that in this cutthroat city. Of course, the finale is a heroic rescue scene in which everyone does their part. It involves Esme bouncing around for quite some time and ruining a very fancy dinner party in Fugly's old inflatable costume, which is the only thing she can wear after her own dress has been destroyed by former chaos. Among many, many other things, Babe saves two newborn chimpanzees and earns the respect of an old, embittered orangutan who ends up transferring his loyalty to Fugly, onto Esme. For all of the darkness this movie's accused of, it has a happy ending if I ever saw one. By the end, Esme and the landlady have clearly bonded; they work out a deal for the future that is perfect for both of them. They rent out the hotel (and it becomes the loud and obnoxious Dancelands, which should please Hortense even more than living across from a menagerie of vacationing animals). The money saves the Hoggett farm. All of the animals, from the monkeys to the poor assortment of down and out, needy strays who showed up to take advantage of Babe's hospitality to the landlady's pets to the random hotel animals who I guess have just been abandoned by their people and now need to be placed, move to the countryside and take up with the farm animals (at least for a while.) Miss Floom, the hotel landlady, now has nowhere to go-but Esme isn't about to leave her all alone. She brings her home and, I gather, practically adopts her as well, on the peaceful farm--a place to which she is infinitely better suited. From the ending I gather that she's now living either with or near Esme and Arthur, filling the role of the sort of daughter they never had (given how distant and disconnected the Hoggetts are from their own child in the first film, and what a wretched brat their granddaughter is.) Reading such things into the movie makes me appreciate it all the more; as different as it is from its predecessor, it enriches it a great deal.

Blame Warner Bros. I personally do not see anything too dark about Batman returns. What's wrong with everyone? Too dark this too dark that, nothing is too dark. It's just darker than the first. Warner Bros were unhappy with the result leading to Batman forever and the exclusion of the massively talented Tim Burton. The amount of artistic freedom he was given in Batman returns is obvious. Batman is called the dark knight, he therefore fights dark villains he is not the only black dressed person in a colorful circus which is supposedly Gotham city (If Schumacher's Gotham was supposed to be a city ravaged by crime then I'm a priest). The much desired commercialism of the last two movies is evident. In Batman forever the bat mobile was obviously designed in order to make a toy that could sell. Why else would they have put a huge fin at the back that served no purpose other than preventing the car from entering a low tunnel?.

It doesn't quite top The Haunting (1963 version), but it runs it pretty close.Firstly the plot is great. Like The Haunting, a group of paranormal investigators are paid to stay in the Belasco House, the Mount Everest of haunted houses. Belasco was a pervert and general deviant in many ways, and his spirit lives on in the house. The cast is also universally excellent, Roddy Mcdowell is very good as the only survivor of a previous stay in the house, Pamela Franklin is also great as the young medium.The Legend of Hell House almost has too much action. It lays the ghostly sightings and other paranormal activity on very thick, with one scare after another and very few lulls. This is great because it keeps the atmosphere going at all times, I can't think of another film that has so much content from start to finish. Also we know from early on that the house is very much haunted, no ambiguous insanity option in this film.The Legend of Hell House is a very well made film, the house looks excellent, the cast is very good, the atmosphere is nice and dark, the plot meanders around well and there is a really unexpected finish. To top it all there is also a possessed cat, you can't ask for much more than that. Highly recommended.

It was no Barcelona, but I sort-of enjoyed it. Although, I can't think of too many other people who would like it at all.A common theme of movie is the idea that we are programmed from a young age to be a certain way.

Another character worries that Lady and Tramp was teaching girls to be vacuous and to be attracted to assholes.In the end of Disco, the characters learn that they may have been programmed at a young age, but it didn't matter too much. Stronger social forces push their direction more than anything else. One character, fearing she's a prude, tries to sleep around only to catch herpes. The affliction forces her back into an exclusive relationship. Another character wonders if he is happy in a relationship, but a job takes him to away from that relationship before he makes the decision for himself. A third character, though perhaps mentally unstable, is now able to live a normal life thanks to modern medication.

The production is very impressive, with a fully fleshed out technicolor Siam practically bursting out of the screen. Deborah Kerr's costumes alone are just about worth the price of admission. The only thing bringing the film down somewhat is the fact that the film occasionally feels patronizing towards Asian culture and the sometimes deliberately infantile lyrics of Oscar Hammerstein, excellent in some places as far as characterization but in other places again seeming to reinforce the film's patronizing attitude towards its characters (and audience?).Brynner's performance ranks among the very best in the history of musical film. It's important that we do not see him sing or dance right away, and in fact he waits until some of the film's final scenes to actually bust out on the dance floor. When he and Kerr go into Shall We Dance? and he is practically sprinting around the dance floor barefoot, I'm sure many in the audience literally drop their jaws. In general, we can say that Brynner's performance managed to capture both the menace, dignity, and authority of the King, while at the same time he was able to wring buckets of humor from the premise of the King's attitudes about women and society in general without compromising that dignity. That alone is a great achievement, but Brynner also manages to give the character great warmth and charm, making him a very appealing character to the audience and almost making us feel that his many transgressions are just minor details in his overall makeup. Simply astounding work.Kerr is decent, actually quite good through most of the film until it comes to the point where she has to be completely angry at the King (because he would not let one of his wives escape with her lover). Then it seems like the work she's done to give this character equal dignity (and almost equal authority) with Brynner's King seems to collapse and we're left with the impression that she's a bit silly, especially as she tells the Prime Minister (Carlos Rivas) I wish I had never come to Siam! and runs off crying. We have the same problem here dramatically speaking, though to a lesser extent, that we have in South Pacific when Nellie decides she can't love the frenchman because he has native children. This doesn't have those racial problems, but it's equally unconvincing really as a dramatic stimulus, making us feel that the primary character has somehow failed to learn what we the audience have learned just through watching them go through their travails! I also feel that the ending in general was a bit rushed. We have Anna going off in a pout crying, and then in the very next scene not only is she leaving Siam but we hear the King of Siam is dying. All very abrupt and feels a bit forced, as if the King had to go onto his deathbed just to wrap the film up.As far as the humor in the King's character, although I admire the way Brynner was able to pull off all these elements, there were times when I personally felt uncomfortable to laugh at the King... something I did not feel when I saw this film as a young child in the early 80s. I guess you can say I'm more racially conscious, but it seemed to me that they were at times encouraging the audience to laugh at the King and even at his court simply because of how backward they were. For instance here we have a King who seems to have a good command of English but who mispronounces a word or skips a word in the sentence if it will make the crowd in America laugh. Not that I think the King should have spoken like an English professor, but I'm convinced that there were moments where I and most modern audiences would cringe where the film's and play's creators would have wanted us to laugh.I didn't want these comments to pass without giving notice and praise to the Little House of Uncle Thomas vignette designed by Jerome Robbins I presume and which also shows some really amazing camera work. The effects here are very cinematic but it's done in such a way that you can believe that the things you're seeing could actually have been done in the 1860s when the film was set. Really excellent work on that portion of the film.Hammerstein's lyrics do not in my opinion rise to the level of Rodgers' music. The patter songs that Brynner does like A Puzzlement are wonderful, but there are just too many songs on here that feel like an imposition of warm family vibes on the story. That's Hammerstein's MO create supremely dramatic situations and surround them with songs that wouldn't be out of place in a nursery school. Things like Hello, Young Lovers, Getting to Know You and I Whistle a Happy Tune make this musicals fan wish for the days of Rodgers and Hart when Rodgers' music could be funny without being so darn clean and family friendly. Something Wonderful is a technically superb song that is completely un-memorable, an example of where Rodgers tried to imitate Kern's style to suit Hammerstein's ambitions. But the duo do make it up to us somewhat with the superb Shall We Dance and Rodgers' solo contributions like March of the Siamese Children.All in all, this is a very solid musical entertainment. Because of Brynner's performance it is a true classic for all the ages. There is enough good here overall to outweigh the bad. This is one that people will be talking about many years after we are all gone. But it's not a perfect film.

It was WAY too dark and violent. Batman (1989) was a huge hit. So was Batman Returns in 1992. However Warner Brothers got tons of complaints from parents about Returns being far too dark and violent for their kids. So Burton didn't direct this one--he's just one of the producers and has a cute cameo as Dr. Burton at the end of the movie. This was done by Joel Schumacher whose version of Batman wasn't anywhere are dark as Burtons. Most people disagree but I actually thought this was a lot of fun.**DEFINITE SPOILERS** The film starts right off with a bang as Batman (Val Kilmer) foils a robbery engineered by Two Face (Tommy Lee Jones). He also meets sexy Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman) who is sexually attracted to him. We also get the Riddler (Jim Carrey) popping up and giving him a needlessly convoluted origin. Him and Two Face decide to team up to kill Batman and control Gotham through a mind machine (don't ask). Also Two Face causes the death of two circus acrobats and their son (Chris O'Donnell) is adopted by Bruce Wayne (Kilmer). I realize that O'Donnell is far too old for the role (he was 25 when he did this) but it works (kind of). He figures out that Wayne is Batman and joins him as Robin to fight the villains. Also Dr. Meridian is trying to psychoanalyze Wayne and has strong suspicions that he's hiding something from her... **END SPOILERS**As I said most people hate this but I had fun. It's fast, well written and well directed by Schumacher. The special effects are impressive and the movie is never boring. There are also a few cute jokes snuck in for comic book fans--Metropolis is mentioned and O'Donnell suggests Nightwing as a name for himself. If you're seeing this for O'Donnell though be warned--he doesn't show up until 30 minutes in and isn't even in costume until the movie is half over. Also there's a loud booming score which perfectly fits the movie. Also I personally like the metal suits Batman and Robin are given. However has anyone ever noticed that Robin's codpiece is bigger than Batmans?The acting wavers--Kilmer is actually quite good as Bruce Wayne\/Batman. Handsome and muscular--a huge improvement over Michael Keaton. Kidman is sexy and believable. Also I like Michael Gough as Alfred and Drew Barrymore is fun in a small role. The rest of the acting isn't that good however. O'Donnell is tall and handsome...but bland and plays Dick Grayson\/Robin as an obnoxious brat. More than once I just wanted Batman to knock him flat. I never liked Carrey and his overacting as the Riddler quickly gets annoying. Jones can be good but he hated playing Two Face...and it shows. He ends up trying to out act Carrey and it's pretty terrible. So I give it an 8 for the story, direction, Kilmer and Kidman. However O'Donnell, Carrey and Jones really got on my nerves.

Freddie Francis' work on this film is great throughout. As much as I enjoyed the film I must admit I had a few major problems, which I will go into later. Firstly the good points. Alongside the cinematography, the acting is very good. Deborah Kerr is excellent as you would expect, showing extreme paranoia and unease throughout. The two children (one of which, Pamela Franklin, would go on some years later to star in The Legend of Hell House) are fine, they are both very believable and do a great job. There are also loads of subtle references throughout the film, which are mentioned in other reviews. There are some scares, mostly the two ghosts, but as in most of these films it is the constant atmosphere of unease that should make it work. Now comes the hard part. To begin with I could not see beyond Deborah Kerrs' character as anything but crazy. She seems to add all the clues together far too easily regarding the link between the two dead servants and the children. Also, unless she had experience in such matters how she comes to the conclusion that if the children say the names of the ghosts they will be OK is very strange and a little abrupt. She is a ministers' daughter, but unless he was an exorcist I can't see it helping. This isn't a major problem but one sequence with a tear (or water droplet) later on seems to change the whole plot. Ambiguous plots and red herrings are great, but I found this a little hard to digest. The film seemed at times more of a melodrama than a spine tingler, and having watched it a second time I must admit I enjoyed it less. Excellent direction and cinematography are not enough I'm afraid. Once my mind was made up on the insane plot angle, the ghostly apparitions had little effect, and I felt anyway these were done without too much subtlety. In these films personally I feel that once the ghosts are shown I find much of the mystery is lost. A good film and recommended, but in my eyes nowhere near as sharp as The Haunting (1963), The Changeling or even The Legend of Hell House.

The first third of this film is so boring, I wonder how many first-time viewers would stick around to watch the whole thing? It's not easy.

First of all we have the maverick cop on the edge who doesn't play by the rules but gets results. Second we have him being teamed up with a by-the-book partner. Third...it's all about drugs. There are countless more, from LA setting to the Vietnam vet psycho stuff and even all the way down to the deep voiced trailer guy saying stuff like 'They'll have to work together even if it kills them' and so-forth.Opening with long travelling shot of LA, complete with an agonizingly 80s credit front, Lethal Weapon begins with the death of a porn actress, high on cocktail of white powders, who thinks she can fly. But what she really gets is a 20-storey descent to the parking lot, the fast way. I first saw Lethal Weapon on TV in about 1990 and this scene had pretty much everything cut from it, the nudity, the drugs, it's amazing people actually made sense of films back then.Anyways, before I go off on a tangent rant, the dead girl is actually the daughter of a crooked banker involved in heroin smuggling. LAPD Sargeant Roger Murtaugh is his old pal and takes the case, but not before being teamed-up with renegade, suicidal cop Martin Riggs. Together 'They don't make the rules, they break them' and 'They'll have to survive each other first' and 'blah blah blah!' Honestly, the wafer-thin plot of Lethal Weapon has truly perished with time. Bad guys smuggle heroin, cops kill them for it. There are multiple, totally absurd elements such as Riggs being a Vietnam vet despite only being about 30 at the time (meaning he was 19 when the conflict ended), the rolling around with the gun firing a gun blindly but still hitting targets is hard to swallow, the martial arts showdown seems to come out of nowhere and belongs in a different film, kids recognizing tiny special forces tattoos from a significant distance and the contrived death of Murtaugh's daughter's never seen boyfriend.In fact, a LOT of this film is contrived and rather ramshackle. Shane Black IS a great writer but this film is just too underdeveloped. We never get to see the heroin or learn anything about how the villains do business. There's not any decent amount of mystery solving or police procedure and there is absolutely NO reason at all for the film being set at Christmas. There is no festive, yuletide atmosphere or Xmasy themes. Plus, with the film being set in LA, Christmas is all blue skies and sun. It adds nothing at all.What makes Lethal Weapon watchable however are the characters and the silly banter between them. Riggs and Murtaugh really seem to click with each other as pals and I think it's this that kept the sequels coming rather than the need to tell another macho action story set in LA.And I do wish that Michael Kamen never used those damn saxophones! The score can frequently be quite jarring and annoying whenever those things start screeching. I have the limited edition score CD, but skip those tracks whenever I stick it on. But since Kamen has died in recent years I will spare him my rant over his misjudged score.Unwisely regarded as a classic, Lethal Weapon only exhibits how to weave 40 million clichés into a macho action movie. The humor is what I like best, I can leave the rest to stagnate back in the 80s, where it really belongs.

This goes for the infamous A Clockwork Orange, famously known for being one of the most controversial films of all-time. I would say it lives up to its title, especially when you look at it from the perspective of a viewer in '71. A Clockwork Orange still holds up today as being a frighteningly disturbing portrait of a ruthless mind. Though not quite as graphic as one might expect, the film holds no bars on its disturbingly genuine nature and shocking content, though all of this is a primary factor of the film's moral. A Clockwork Orange is neither exploitive, nor degrading because all the content is in equilibrium with the importance and startling impact of the film.Adapted from Anthony Burgess' novel, A Clockwork Orange follows the futuristic story of the foul, repulsive and oddly intelligent sickening screwball Alex de Large (Malcolm McDowell) and his gang of droogs. They prowl the nights with their disgusting habits of terror and take out their undesirable temperament on the unsuspecting public. Alex eventually gets arrested and put upon a scientific rehabilitation program which is supposed to make the degenerates of society normal people and eventually making it impossible for Alex to commit any kind of wrongdoing. The experiment does not quite go according to plan for the young hoodlum.For a film of such fierce, challenging, depressing and wildly vivid nature there is still so much wonder and beauty to be found from it. The sheer magnitude of the film's unparallelled intelligence, entertainment value and ingenuity is something that will grasp even the most easily offended or unpredictable of viewers. Whether you like or dislike A Clockwork Orange remains to be seen (yes, it is certainly a film that does not appeal to all tastes) because you will undoubtedly respect for many reasons.The audacious title, A Clockwork Orange is quite possibly the finest film-title ever imagined, it helps you understand the film and primarily represents the controlled mechanism for maintaining society. Ultimately, Alex becomes artificial on the outside, while still being perverted at heart. The number of morals and ethics discussed throughout the film is something that deserves the utmost appreciation of the literature essays the novel and film receives in schools around the world. Violence is an emblem of human nature, yet it is something that should be restrained and compressed through self-control. The film shows how even the most cruel and vile of human beings still have humane rudiments. The film goes into studying youth frustration, the rebellion in youth, individuality, philosophy, the breeding of control, , society ranks, conformity, realising one's problems, being somebody rather than something, freedom (being reborn\/revitalised) and how violence breeds violence. The film gives such a wonderful message and also morals for its viewers, yet sadly it is one that has been cruelly misinterpreted by the more immature viewers. The film's final line sums up a lot about what I have mentioned above in the notoriously clear, resounding and extraordinary image. Legendary director Stanley Kubrick gives a visionary adaptation from page to screen, giving the film a versatile and unique quality. The use of colourful and techno set-pieces creates the mad-world, which is so close to our own. There are so many tiny details the film holds, everything from the astonishingly unforgettable makeup to the masterful facial expressions from Malcolm McDowell all help to create a timeless experience in visceral film-making. The adaptable use of poetic slang makes you apart of the gang experience, putting you into the shoes of the one of the ultimate anti-heroes. It is poetry brimming with a glorious elegance and harsh boldness. The use of quirky dark comedy is hysterical and at the same time bewildering helping to make the viewing even more immersive. The editing it magnificently displayed through a graceful use of slow-motion and fast-forward scenes, the film's bare style is truly stunning. Malcolm McDowell's performance is one of the greatest character performances of all-time, Kubrick's casting decision is beyond perfect offering an actor the role of a lifetime.Some people have accused this vivid spectacle of a social commentary of being self-absorbed or aching mass attention. I don't see A Clockwork Orange as that, rather it's quite the opposite, it gives people a discussion point and a discussion point that questions one's own views.

It was an incredible experience and the first twenty minutes or so was intense, graphic, and completely realistic. It is known as probably one of the greatest scenes in cinema history ever. It was a great beginning to an incredible movie.Tom Hanks plays Captain John H. Miller. After surviving the attack at Omaha Beach (known now as D-Day) he and his platoon are given new orders to search for a private Ryan and bring him back home. You see, all of Ryan's brothers have been killed in combat, and since he is the last survivor, the higher ups in the U.S. military want him returned safely to his grieving mother who has already lost three of her boys.Miller of course takes the job. He doesn't much like it, but he is just following the orders of his superiors. When he tells his platoon about it, they are all against it. After all, why should they risk all their lives for one person. They gripe about it, but ultimately they followed their leader and go on the search mission behind enemy lines where Ryan's squadron was parachuted in.Along the way we learn about the characters, yet the pace never was drawn out. As the action is happening we are also learning a little bit about the characters. Vin Diesel had and early roll with this movie, and other actors include Tom Sizemore as Sergeant Mike Horvath, Edward Burns as Private Richard Reiben, Barry Pepper as Private Daniel Jackson, Adam Goldberg as Private Stanley Mellish, and Henry Thomas. All were good in their roles.This movie had excellent cinematography and editing as well as great sound. It was no wonder it won the academy awards for all of these, and I also believe that Spielberg's Oscar for Best Director was the right choice.

A bunch of half-witted aliens want Earthlings to recognize their existence, but the governments of the planet keep repelling them. Their latest, and ninth plan, for creating extra-terrestrial awareness among humans is to raise their dead, 'cause nothing says ALIENS! like the re-animated corpses of Swedish wrestlers, vampiric television hosts and Hungarian horror stars (of course Lugosi was almost literally brought back from the dead to be in this movie). The first time around, I only found the film sporadically funny. Mostly it was boring. Can't say my opinion of it raised too much, though I think I did laugh more this time around. I especially giggled at the whole concept of the Solaranite bomb, which would somehow cause the Earth's sun to explode, along with every single celestial body that sunlight touches. It's especially funny to me because they talk about the sun's light as having matter, and there used to be this really dull kid in my dorm in college who would argue that light had mass. He would literally argue with genius physics majors about this when he would get drunk on Saturday nights.

As such, Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Aniston's characters are probably some of the better written and most believable characters in the movie. (In fact, Cameron Diaz stole the show) You really do feel for some of the female casts.This, however, does not mean it gets a free pass with it's less than stellar characters... Maxine Bahns was... mediocre at best. But the rest of the male characters come across more like caricatures then real people. Mike McGlone is basically what happens if you take every alpha male stereotype, roll it through some dirt, and mix it together. I'd like to say that it's a good concept, but he comes across as just too unbelievable to me. The same can be said about John Mahoney's character, who while not as much of a caricature, can basically be summed with chauvinistic conservative patriarch who ends up screwing up their son's lives. The only person that is even remotely likable, being Edward Burns character is a little unbelievable at times too. I think the only good moments that Ed Burns has are from the scenes where he's with Cameron Diaz. And in the end, these characters are not written to be people, they were written to be ideas and archetypes to be used for commentary.However, having said that, some of the dialogue is pretty entertaining and some of the repartee between the characters are fun to listen to.The thing is though, funny dialogue doesn't give character depth.Not bad as far as a romantic comedy goes, but definitely not home run movie.

The acting is amazing, the story is gripping and the cinematography is poignant and dark.A lot films have stereotypical good characters for the audience to feel an affinity with; but make no mistake, there are no heroes in this film. One can't help but notice that the main character, although smooth and sexy, is involving him self with something ridiculously stupid. Zed also seems to have trouble standing up for him self, especially against his friend the ringleader, Eric. Even in the first 10 mins of the film he's hard to like for these reasons. He is however, the only character in the film you can feel any kind of empathy for. This is mainly because he is the main character and it's almost as if we are made to. I'm sure one could empathize with Zoë if she wasn't featured and characterized so little throughout the film. Her role is a very important one however, and I think we spend such little time with her in order to realize that Zed is just starting to live his life (Zoë means life in Greek), when he meets feels an affinity with Zoë. The audience is suppose to see what Zed sees and feel what Zed feels. He doesn't get to know Zoë well during the course of the film therefore neither do we. Another way this is achieved is through the cinematography. If you remember during the sex scene switching between the black and white horror film that was on the television and a naked Zoë from the perspective of Zed, who was lying below her. We see what he sees. Most of the shots in the first half of the film are fairly close up as well if you remember, this gives us a sense of closeness to Zed, and also of nervous tension, which is the emotion he must be feeling coming to a new city for such a reason as armed robbery.One of the things to remember when watching this film is that in order to to enjoy and appreciate a film, you don't nessecerly have to like the characters or what they do. On quite a few occasions during this film I found my self flinching, especially at the treatment and portrayal women and of course the homicidal actions of some of the main characters. However, this film is an enthralling roller coaster ride of violence, drugs and depravity and despite everything cringe worthy, it is very enjoyable. The acting is very natural, so much so that one wonders if some of it was ad-lib. Eric Stoltz is wonderful as always and Jean-Hugues Anglade is the best I've ever seen him. He plays a really good maniac!Roger Avary really should stick to what he's good at and make more films like this one.
