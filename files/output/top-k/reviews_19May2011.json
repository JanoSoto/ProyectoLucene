[{"date":"19 May 2011","score":"","review":" The opening shot is of Billy Crudup's agonized eye filling with tears as he watches a television newscaster announce that the love of his life, Jennifer Connolly, has been killed in Chile while engaged in some populist political activity. This is always a bad sign -- the first thing you see being a eyeful of tears. It portends little levity.It gets worse. As ten years pass by, Crudup begins to think he sees and hears Connolly on the streets of New York, where he works in the District Attorney's office. The first time this happens, he walking at night through a vacant parking lot and he hears Connolly whisper something from their shared past. Crudup stops, looks around, and says aloud, Sarah? Now, this is really bad. It's not bad to fantasize about Jennifer Connolly. Not at all. I do it all the time. But there is a difference between imagination and auditory hallucinations.The movie flashes back and forth between 1972 and 1982-83. In the early years, Crudup and Connolly are madly in love. He's a Harvard grad who is in the Coast Guard as a compromise between being drafted and leaving for exile in Canada. The facts as stated are a little topsy turvy inasmuch as the Coast Guard had personnel and KIAs in Vietnam while not a single son of Harvard was killed -- but okay. It's symbolic of Crudup's willingness to find a middle ground.He's a committed Democrat and Connolly is fully engaged too, but from a different direction. Crudup's ambition is to initiate social change from the top down. He jokes about becoming president. Connolly's approach is more direct. It begins at the bottom, working with the poor through the church, and moving upward, more of an international Mother Teresa than a speechifier.As if ordained by the god of screen writing, there are two reciprocal scenes in which each must meet the co-workers of the other and burst into an angry, oath-filled malediction of the hypocrisy of the others' position. At one party, Crudup blows his top at a priest and some guests; at the next, Connolly tells a crowd of well-dressed muckamucks where to go.By this time I'm thinking, Another pair of star-crossed politics, with the guy as sell-out and the woman as conscience. Well, if it worked for The Way We Were, why shouldn't it work here? But it really doesn't work very well. After learning of Connolly's death, Crudup continues to catch glimpses of her in crowds and he hears her whispers. Once, he appears to receive a phone call from her, claiming that she's not really dead but that the incident was faked for political reasons. Crudup marries the niece of one of his wealthy patrons and is elected to Congress. By this time he's really nuts.In the one truly splendid scene in the film, he joins a half dozen of his friends and relatives for a celebratory dinner at an Indian restaurant. Everyone congratulates him of course. But then he tells them he has something important to say before they order -- and he launches into a fine impression of an ordinary guy trying desperately to describe a psychosis. He can't do it well, of course; nobody can who hasn't been there. But the director, Keith Gordon, handles the scene very well. Once Crudup begins to break up and yield to speech pressure, the camera lingers on him and lets him riff. The temptation would be to cut away to the stunned stares of his guests, but the director's self discipline allows us to guess what they are. All we see, as Crudup's voice gets faster and rises in volume, is that some of the diners in the background stop talking and glance uneasily at him.The actors are all seasoned professionals. None of the principals stands out. The most winning performance, in a relatively small role, is that of Janet McTeer as Crudup's sensible sister. Connolly's looks are unimpeachable but she was at that age where supernally radiant young girls turn into ordinarily beautiful women. Crudup, I don't know. He's not magnetic in any way but he pulls it off without any major glitches.There's a final meeting -- or rather meeting -- between Crudup and Connolly in Washington just after he's been elected. In his empty apartment (empty on the night of his election!) the doorbell rings and it's Connolly in a drab wet raincoat. They hug. They kiss. They whisper. They lie on the floor and he falls asleep and when he wakes up she's gone, never to be seen again.I still don't know whether her last visit was real or not, he tells us. He doesn't? I don't know why not, because I know. We can all hope that he prunes his fantasies down to a more realistic level, at least as far as his politics are concerned. As for his love life, well, he's got Molly Parker, which is not a losing hand.

She is sleeping with Brad Pitt's character of Tyler Durden, but in the end, we find out she has really been sleeping with Norton's character. The only character's name that could give something away would be Edward Norton's character due to him not even having a name; they just call him the narrator. Brat Pitt's character always looks nice after a fight, like it didn't even happen, and that is how most girls imagine an attractive man to look like. Edward Norton's character always looks tired, run-down, and like he doesn't care about anything. Carter's character Marla looks crazy. Her hair is always messed up, as well as her make-up.The setting is mysterious and dark. It takes place in a city, but the viewers are never given a specific city, which lets them know that a fight club could be started anywhere. The mood of the film was depressing and gives off the feeling that no one cares about anything you do, and everyone's lives suck. I feel the setting and mood make Norton's character show his true colors. There are a lot of crime looking areas and run down places in the film and it could be foreshadowing how Norton's character is feeling inside. The point-of-view is the narrator, Edward Norton. Imagery I took from the film was the way Brad Pitt and Edward Norton looked. Pitt's character always was in great shape while Norton's character always looked worn out. Pitt's character is the typical standard for women of what a man should look like, and Norton's character is the typical crazy looking person people imagine. The camera angles in the film show you who is talking and, in a way, from whose point-of-view we are in at the time. In a few scenes, Norton's character breaks the fourth wall when he looks directly into the camera and talks to the audience. The music is music directors put in to add suspense and to let the viewer know when something big or important is going to happen. The movie Fight Club was an interesting and confusing movie.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"19 May 2011","score":"","review":" This is a very average movie with a very, even for that time, tired old plot. Not unbelievable, mind you, but you have seen this story in sooo many mid-80s comedies, the worst being The Secret of My Success with Michael J. Fox. That movie was insanely farcical, though.Here, the farce is toned down. There is an extremely off sequence at the start which involves the title of the movie. It doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the story. It is more of the Marx Bros. screwball comedy variety, where the rest belongs more in the vein of family comedy.Christina Applegate, who is a smart woman, played a very dumb blonde on the hit sitcom Married with Children as most everybody knows. She finally got a part where she was serviced well. Not that her character here is a genius, but she gets to play all tangents Surly, upbeat, successful and finally brought down. Sorry to say that the movie isn't that compelling as she is. There is an abundance of stock characters, like the one played by John Getz and even the one played by the mostly appealing, Joanna Cassidy. I loved her in Who Framed Roger Rabbitt and she had a great recurring character on Boston Legal as Denny Crane's scheming fianceé. The reason I find her a stock character is that she appears to be a smart woman but is brought down by her inability to see through Sue Ellen (Applegate) at the very beginning. Then again, if she did, the movie would be over.There are some good characters, like the one played by Keith Coogan. He definitely shows range as he is playing two characters with equal aplomb, the loser and the reformed. I did find his transformation believable. Applegate's transformation is a little forced. Yes, we know that she has to make amends to all the people she did wrong, including her mother. It sounds like a John Hughes coming of age tale, and you know what? It is. But just because something worked for him, doesn't necessarily mean that it is any better the second, third, fourth time.

I recall being a child and seeing Peter Lorre in movies with Vincent Price and a couple of Bugs Bunny cartoons as the mad scientist. I had always thought that he was a bit creepy. But the first time I saw M made me notice Peter Lorre as a man.I won't include any spoilers, but I did discover some things about this film. It was directed by the great Fritz Lang of Metropolis fame and was also the first film about a serial murderer. It gives a rare glimpse of the buildings and general life of pre-war Berlin, touches on the forensics of the day and, in the end, forces the viewer to take mental illness into consideration when dealing with crime in society. It's sudden cut-off at the end of the film was done before in Metropolis, but here it leaves the audience with a different thought to ponder what is to be done with people like this that commit these types of crimes? Peter Lorre was extremely convincing in this role that eventually earned him international recognition. At one point in the movie, we get a brief glimpse of his character observing himself in a mirror. We are made to wonder, What is he thinking when he sees himself there? Does he know who he is or what it is that he has done? Peter plays the character so well that it is literally the first time I really noticed him. He is young, rotund, not very attractive but something about that particular shot, even at just a few seconds, is striking to me. I noticed his character, felt a kind of disgust mingled with pity, which made me notice Peter Lorre, which made me realise his extraordinary talent to make the audience believe that he is the person that he is playing. Suddenly he becomes very attractive to me. His unusual eyes peer at his reflection and instantly he is type-cast forever in his subsequent films. Another reviewer pointed out that only liberals would have sympathy for Hans Beckert. I have to disagree strongly. Sympathy transcends all political parties. What happens in this movie is the realisation that the mentally disturbed often do NOT have control over their actions and reactions. Their brain chemistry does not function the way it does in a person that is normal. In many cases it leads them to do strange things or even what is the unthinkable. Some of these people do not know or even realise what they have done until after the action has happened. For this I pity Hans Beckert and others like him. If he knew what he was doing he would not have done it. That much is related at the end of the movie. Yet we are still left with the nagging question what does society do with these dangerous individuals that sometimes do not know what they have done? Is it right to simply imprison them? Should they undergo psychotherapy and eventually be released again or kept in an institution where they will not endanger the members of society beyond the hospital walls? Or shall we demand the ultimate price of them? How can we punish them when oftentimes their crime is not pre-meditated but instead a reaction to their brain's unusual chemistry? The debate goes on, I suppose.I would like very much to have seen Peter Lorre play other roles which he very much wanted to do. Would he have been as good as say, Jimmy Stewart, in It's A Wonderful Life? Perhaps we could never imagine him in such a role because of his great talent playing a shady foreigner. Sadly, he is gone now and we will never know how well he might have done them or what impact it could have had on his audiences.This film is a treasure for movie lovers, particularly for people that love classic cinema, the foundational pieces of art upon which our modern movies are built. Peter Lorre is a man well loved even today and whose talents will endure in the hearts and minds of his admirers.

Should they undergo psychotherapy and eventually be released again or kept in an institution where they will not endanger the members of society beyond the hospital walls? Or shall we demand the ultimate price of them? How can we punish them when oftentimes their crime is not pre-meditated but instead a reaction to their brain's unusual chemistry?

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"19 May 2011","score":"","review":" About three months ago I saw this film for the very first time. It was one of those eye-opening experiences for me. I recall being a child and seeing Peter Lorre in movies with Vincent Price and a couple of Bugs Bunny cartoons as the mad scientist. I had always thought that he was a bit creepy. But the first time I saw M made me notice Peter Lorre as a man.I won't include any spoilers, but I did discover some things about this film. It was directed by the great Fritz Lang of Metropolis fame and was also the first film about a serial murderer. It gives a rare glimpse of the buildings and general life of pre-war Berlin, touches on the forensics of the day and, in the end, forces the viewer to take mental illness into consideration when dealing with crime in society. It's sudden cut-off at the end of the film was done before in Metropolis, but here it leaves the audience with a different thought to ponder what is to be done with people like this that commit these types of crimes? Peter Lorre was extremely convincing in this role that eventually earned him international recognition. At one point in the movie, we get a brief glimpse of his character observing himself in a mirror. We are made to wonder, What is he thinking when he sees himself there? Does he know who he is or what it is that he has done? Peter plays the character so well that it is literally the first time I really noticed him. He is young, rotund, not very attractive but something about that particular shot, even at just a few seconds, is striking to me. I noticed his character, felt a kind of disgust mingled with pity, which made me notice Peter Lorre, which made me realise his extraordinary talent to make the audience believe that he is the person that he is playing. Suddenly he becomes very attractive to me. His unusual eyes peer at his reflection and instantly he is type-cast forever in his subsequent films.

That is how one of the best-written movies of the last 20 years opens. The movie that earned the first Oscar to Coen brothers and made F. McDormand into an international star. Besides, S. Buscemi and P. Stormare performances should not be forgotten either. Fargo is a story about pathetic man's pathetic plan to gain some money. It is set in Minnesota in the middle of the winter. Coen brothers are not afraid to play with genres so it is hard to tell if Fargo is a dark comedy, crime drama or something else. The movie begins in a typical bar where from the dialog between pitiful Jerry Lundergaard (W. H. Macy) and two criminals (S. Buscemi and P. Stormare) we are given the context of the story. Jerry tells that he wants to get his wife kidnapped so that he could get some ransom money from his father-in-law (H. Presnell). The deal is set and the story sets off. As usual, in Coens movies, nothing goes according to the plan of characters and the story falls into absurdity. Firstly, kidnapping ends with a three cold-blooded murders and the start of murders investigation. This is there Marge Gunderson (F. McDormand) gets into a picture. She guesses everything right from the start and shines among other foolish characters (I'm not sure I agree with you a hundred percent on your police work, there, Lou). From this moment, the story splits into three parts &#x96; investigation by Marge, pathetic Jerry's attempts to fix everything and hilarious relations between criminals. These parts come to one only at the very end of the movie that is both funny and thoughtful at the same time. One of the most significant things that made Fargo successful is the character of Jerry Lundergaard. Jerry probably is the most pathetic man in the whole movie. He is wrong in every possible way and it seems that he cares about nothing but himself (he even forgets how this kidnapping scheme will effect his son). Firstly, he works in his father-in-law's car dealership and is a lousy salesperson who sells cars by telling lies to customers and family life is no better &#x96; it seems that the true head of the family is his father-in-law. When he gets himself in some financial problems Jerry is so afraid of telling it to his father-in-law that he is prepared to steel money rather than ask for it. In addition, he even practices his speech before telling his father-in-law about the kidnapping. As the story goes further, criminals, Marge and father-in-law press Jerry more and more until he brakes down. However, there is one scene in the movie when we can see some humanity from Jerry. It is the scene there Carl Showalter (S. Buscemi) threatens to kill not only his wife but his son as well. Jerry impulsively tells to leave his son away from this and he seems to be very serious about it. Another thing to mention is a hilarious screen couple of S. Buscemi and P. Stormare. They are total opposites of one another. Carl is an annoying talky type hothead who does nothing right while Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) is a cold-blooded professional who prefers to act rather than speak. Carl seems to irritate Gaear in every possible way from blabbering about the silence of Gaear (Two can play at that game, smart guy) to an inability to deal with unexpected difficulties (I'll take care of this). It is hard to imagine how these two characters became associates. To sum up, Fargo is a well-written and well-acted story about very interesting and complex humans that makes you laugh and cry at the same time and in the end, we are left with a conclusion said by Marge &#x96; There's more to life than a little money. These words perfectly sum up the entire movie themes and help to characterize characters by dividing them in to those who do and those who do not agree with Marge's words. 2011-05-19 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 May 2011","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" A typical car shows up in a world of snow.

There's no way that could work, right? Wrong. Allen, in all of his neurotic genius, has created his own zany brand of sci-fi comedy. Of course it is all in the style of your typical Woody Allen film and sci-fi is more of a backdrop, but there is still no denying that Allen has wonderfully blended the two genres. Sleeper is a movie about Miles Monroe, played, of course, by Woody Allen. Miles was a whole foods store owner and clarinet player who died in 1973. He is revived out of cryostatis 200 years into the future where the world is suppressed by a big brother type government. Miles only wants to go back to 1973, but he eventually gets involved with a rebellion against the government.

I'd heard a lot about Bergman, about how he was one of the all-time greats, so I decided to watch The Seventh Seal. Frankly, I wasn't overly impressed. I've seen it again since then, and I liked it a lot better the second time, but my first impression was disappointment. But not long afterward, I decided to get back on the horse and give Bergman one more shot. The second movie I tried was Wild Strawberries, and that was another story altogether.The story is a relatively simple one. Professor Isak Borg (Victor Sjöström), an aging physician, is traveling to Lund to receive an honorary degree. Accompanying him is his daughter-in-law, Marianne (Ingrid Thulin). Along the way, they make various acquaintances &#x96; a trio of young travelers, an embittered married couple, Borg's mother, a former patient, etc. Each of these encounters recalls some memory, some event in Borg's life, recollections of his childhood, his family, his estranged wife, his boyhood sweetheart. Over the course of the film, Borg's life is reconstructed before our eyes, and through HIS eyes, we see our own questions being asked, our own tribulations being explored.The film has its share of many typical Bergman trademarks psychology, existential angst, questions of the existence of God, strange dream sequences, feelings of loneliness, and an exploration of the apparent meaninglessness of life. But at the same time, the film has a warmth that you don't often get from Bergman, as well as glimmers of hope, a sense that maybe all isn't lost after all.The acting is solid throughout, and the performance delivered by Sjöström is particularly touching, portraying a tired, trouble man, struggling with his own stubborn, judgmental, alienating tendencies.I've seen many Bergman films since I first saw Wild Strawberries, and he's come to be one of my favorite directors, but to this day, Wild Strawberries is my favorite of his films. To me, it's one of his most cohesive, well-conceived, clearly executed films, and its impact survives repeated viewings.

In the film, the dark variant found its true form people were dissatisfied and unheroic. Double Indemnity, and just almost every noir after it, was characterized by sadistic and brutal cultural behavior or; the complete lack of behavior. In this interpretation a clear difference was made to more romantic noirs, such as Howard Hawks' The Big Sleep (1946). The genre is both unlimited and connected; it is hard to draw the line between dark films and films that are film-noir but crime is a thing that unites them all -- it is a necessity of some kind -- it is a prism through which we can observe life as it is, ahead of all the illusions.Double Indemnity starts with a wounded insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) walking up to his partner Barton Keys' (Edward G. Robinson) office. He has got a confession to make we enter a flashback which equals most of the film. He was seduced by a beautiful woman into cheating his insurance company in order to get a double indemnity for the woman's husband's death. But soon their love turned into hatred. Film-noir can mean an attitude, series of films, sub-genre or a mode, and just like other genres -- western and gangster-film for instance -- it uses the same milieus over and over again night clubs, hotel rooms, apartments, police stations, offices, docks, run-down and luxury restaurants, rural houses that are about to collapse, boxing rings and railway stations. In a typical film-noir story there is a desperate man who gets seduced by a dangerous woman. But in Double Indemnity there is also another reason for the protagonist's action the temptation to try one's luck, to try if you could succeed in a perfect crime which is probably the reason why Alfred Hitchcock loved the film so much.The directors who created film-noir came from Europe. In M (1931) Fritz Lang developed the atmosphere for film-noir with its strong contrasts and expressionistic imagery. Since the people who created the genre were from Europe, the influences obviously came from their colony French pessimism (Duvivier), German expressionism and European surrealism. To this colorful group the director of Double Indemnity Billy Wilder also belongs to. He came to Hollywood from Austria-Hungary also in the 1930's. These filmmakers were creating a world where the latitude of man was limited; the chance of individual freedom was impossible and unreachable. The best cinematographers achieved to combine expressionism with realism, in this limited milieu, to light actual sites by aesthetic styling.Fatality, guile and cheating were always part of the thematics of film-noir and in Double Indemnity nothing is what it first appears to be and each first impression bluffs Keys' ex-girlfriend who he was going to marry turned out to be manic depressive and Phyllis first seemed to be truly worried for her husband. Then Phyllis and Walter cheated Mr. Dietrichson into signing the life insurance but Phyllis was actually cheating Walter all along. Their love had now turned into hatred. After the picture started to get clearer for Walter, he decided to double-cross Phyllis but what he didn't guess was that Phyllis knew that he knew that she was a double-crosser. They both tried to cheat each other but neither succeed in it. The whole world double-crosses and acts.The aesthetics of film-noir is often tied around big cities like New York and Los Angeles, and its visual world has its own icons too dark and narrow alleys, rainy streets, wet and moist surfaces, images of water, mirrors, shiny steel, the dim lighting of the milieus. And through visual aesthetics and first-person narrative Double Indemnity reached poetry of summer nights the Californian hills and mountains, strolling roads, old chateaus, dusty and rainy suburban blocks.The poetic-like first-person narrative and flashbacks are also a big part of film-noir. Especially after Double Indemnity which, as said, was the culmination of the genre's dynamic form. Through Walter's monologue, his confession, the story gets a deterministic twist like it was all fate, and everything we observe are constantly related to Walter's subjective truth. For its time the story is set in the year 1938 -- just like the original novel by James M. Cain -- loose from the year 1944 and WWII, to the age of recession; to its psychology and financial awareness. It gives an inner explanation why Walter is desperate and does what he does.The confessions of a murderer waiting for his death, relay a picture of life as lead by fate or chance to judgment. Only when Walter has to face death he is ready to confess, and sees life as it is -- just like Camus' Mersault. As mentioned, through this the film gets a deterministic twist, but the ending also indicates to Hollywood's censorship crime must always have its punishment. But this juvenile message is relayed to us ironically the violators of law and morality have to redeem their sins, in the double-crossing world.Billy Wilder always liked to criticize just about everything, from communism to capitalism, and from militarism to pacifism. Just like Some Like It Hot (1958) so does Double Indemnity brush the subject of the American dream. But unlike in Some Like It Hot, it's not about the different versions of the dream and the mad profusion of it but about its true naivety. In Double Indemnity the American dream is seen as a juvenile way to get satisfaction, at any price. If the film is for its themes purely about Americanism, guile, existence, anxiety and the double-crossing world, its thesis is this when fear enters the game, love suddenly turns into hatred.

In the film, the dark variant found its true form people were dissatisfied and unheroic. Double Indemnity, and just almost every noir after it, was characterized by sadistic and brutal cultural behavior or; the complete lack of behavior. In this interpretation a clear difference was made to more romantic noirs, such as Howard Hawks' The Big Sleep (1946). The genre is both unlimited and connected; it is hard to draw the line between dark films and films that are film-noir but crime is a thing that unites them all -- it is a necessity of some kind -- it is a prism through which we can observe life as it is, ahead of all the illusions.Double Indemnity starts with a wounded insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) walking up to his partner Barton Keys' (Edward G. Robinson) office. He has got a confession to make we enter a flashback which equals most of the film. He was seduced by a beautiful woman into cheating his insurance company in order to get a double indemnity for the woman's husband's death. But soon their love turned into hatred. Film-noir can mean an attitude, series of films, sub-genre or a mode, and just like other genres -- western and gangster-film for instance -- it uses the same milieus over and over again night clubs, hotel rooms, apartments, police stations, offices, docks, run-down and luxury restaurants, rural houses that are about to collapse, boxing rings and railway stations. In a typical film-noir story there is a desperate man who gets seduced by a dangerous woman. But in Double Indemnity there is also another reason for the protagonist's action the temptation to try one's luck, to try if you could succeed in a perfect crime which is probably the reason why Alfred Hitchcock loved the film so much.The directors who created film-noir came from Europe. In M (1931) Fritz Lang developed the atmosphere for film-noir with its strong contrasts and expressionistic imagery. Since the people who created the genre were from Europe, the influences obviously came from their colony French pessimism (Duvivier), German expressionism and European surrealism.

","genre":"Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"19 May 2011","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Let's use the detective film as example.At a basic level filmmakers tell us detective stories, where the man seeking 'truth' unravels a plot. Our reward is the answer to the riddle.Better filmmakers invoke the atmospheres of the places where these similar stories have taken place. Having invoked a visual memory, a set of images that we associate with a type of film, they wish to see behind the image, the processes by which it comes into being. Lynch does this, by presenting us with noir situations as they manifest in the mind. Here he we experience the detective film internally, where it was generated in the first place. Our reward, often in the absence of any easy answers, is a glimpse of the mechanisms behind the questions.And there's a select few filmmakers, sages of cinema, who emerge from this pursuit for meaning with wisdom and the ability to inform our awareness in turn. By severing the bonds that bind him to ego and the self, the journalist in The Passenger, abandons his role as the man seeking 'truth'. What we're left with is an awareness of the world as it is, a playground of possibilities and distant threats where films vaguely unfold in the background. At some point in the 70's, Polanski seemed like he could fit all the criteria. Then something happened, and he resurfaced later in Europe in a Hitchcock mode. We can practically see the transition in the two halves of Frantic, as the elusive mystery turns into a conspiracy. The Ninth Gate (and to a lesser extent The Ghost Writer) show the decadence of that mode.We have a detective here seeking hidden meanings in ancient relics.

He speaks throughout the movie through 1st person point of view and is Tyler Durden's sidekick. At first he is a well-dressed, tired, and hardworking man who is quiet. He transforms into a manly man when he meets Tyler and becomes contented with life. Tyler Durden is the other main character who technically forms fight club and leads the narrator to become what he always wanted to be. He is rough and tough. He smokes habitually and is harsh. He is portrayed this way to be more of a man than the narrator. He will fight anyone, and never takes no for an answer. The other main character is Marla. She is a cigarette addicted, suicidal woman, who also attends the support group meetings for amusement. She is dark and dirty, which contributes to her psycho personality and messed up life. The stuck in life woman has a love affair with Tyler and continues a tense and awkward relationship with the Narrator. Most incidences in this film occur in the basement of a bar, a giant decrepit house, or strings of other bars across the country. The basement of the main bar in which Fight Club is practiced is no finished basement. It has concrete floors and walls, and rickety columns. It was dirty and dark; perfect for fighting bloody fights. The big and crumbling house is the two main characters' home. It becomes the base of Fight Club turned Project Mayhem and gives the same effect as the basement of the bar. Something that really sticks a picture in your mind would be when narrator relays how Tyler believed that making soap with fat from the plastic surgery clinic was a great way to serve American Women, &#x85;their fat asses back to them. It was satisfying to see the look of women's faces if they ever found out that they were rubbing their own fat back on to themselves. It was a hilarious way to get the audience into the mind of Tyler Durden; a truly sharp and entertaining character. The camera jumps around constantly. It helps the film with the action and the confusion that the characters experience throughout the movie and was therefore a good choice on the producer's part. The music is a mix of rock, metal, and dark techno. It adds to the overall confusing and dark theme of the film along with the camera angles. If you are looking for a great movie that will make you sit down and think about a crazy man's words or if you are just looking for something action packed, Fight Club is for you. It is a superb film that will have you thinking long after viewing.

Two cartoons were missing though and I found out they were banned because of racial stereotypes' portrayals on black people, and that they would never be put on DVD, or TV again, despite all the fans' protests and all the petitions these cartoons were judged too offensive. No offense, but this is just bullshit, the only word to describe this is censorship pure and simple. And in 2004, its reign of terror wasn't over yet &#x85;I'm evoking this anecdote just to highlight the sad reality that we still live in a world governed by a scandalous hypocrisy disguising censorship under the mask of political correctness. Lenny Bruce was censored because of his use of profanity and Larry Flynt for his pornographic images. Now that the Internet trivialized sex, the new taboo is communities. The 21st century is religious, racial, sectary and unfortunately, the fight featured in The People vs. Larry Flynt had only changed the field. The War is not over; the nonsense is still governing non-independent media, and we're still brainwashed &#x85;This is why The People vs. Larry Flynt is probably one of the most important films of the last two decades. It reveals the disastrous sickness that poisons America and Occidental counties in general Political Correctness, the new dictatorship against every single principle that makes freedom of speech applicable. The message could be summarized in a simple point, in the case of absence of malice, one should make fun, mock, ridicule whatever people, institution, he or she desires. It's not up to the offender to anticipate the harm he will cause, it's up to the offended to accept the idea that whatever allowed one to talk against him, it will allow him to retort, in a satirical, serious or whatever tone he chooses to use. In one word it's called tolerance.That's exactly why The People vs. Larry Flynt is not just a pamphlet written by Milos Forman using profanity, sex, lust, and nudity as so many punctuation marks. It's an inspirational message inviting us to question our approach to tolerance, and not in a preachy way. Larry Flynt is not a model, he's a dirty mind, but as he says, he's the worst and as the worst, he'll be the perfect thermometer to measure the acceptance of a country when it comes to the use of humor. But as I also stated in a previous review of Fosse's Lenny, any simple form of thought is necessarily subversive. Any artistic creation offends a certain established order, otherwise, it's just creation but not Art. Larry Flynt offended, he broke a new taboo, but have we all forgotten that many today's standards were yesterday's taboos?! The philosophical value of The People vs. Larry Flynt is undeniable but I guess people were blinded by the profusion of nudity and lust at a point they didn't get how the film is incredibly brilliant in the demonstrations it tries to make ... sometimes in an explicitness I would have judged extreme if the course of the recent events hadn't proved how the point of the film was totally missed. Flynt paved the way to a certain philosophy of freedom that could allow many irreverent entertainers to undermine the image of sacred public, figures or institutions and even, for our delight, respectable cultural figures. But, there's more to that -something that'll make me venerate the film forever- it's the denunciation of an extreme contradiction that could threaten the application of freedom in a whole country nothing is sacred enough not to be turned into derision. And if one thing shall be sacred, it's this principle.The title sets the mood of the film which is an endless fight through so many judiciary cases involving the 'good people' and Larry Flynt, another title could have been Larry Flynt, Public Enemy N°1 but this would have been wrong as Flynt had some fans interested on boobs, vagina, and fornication. And in a way, Flynt had done a great service to his country by desensitizing them about the dirtiness of sex. While many citizens were brainwashed to believe that Wars make heroes, in one of the most obscene masquerades that lead American to an humiliating defeat in Nam, Flynt unmasked the ugly face of American pride to reconcile it, with stuff that reaches a lower level ... only to prove there's no reason to feel guilty about loving harmless stuff just because good society says so. Especially when desensitization from violence can have even more devastating effects.And on a technical level, The People vs. Larry Flynt is certainly one of the most brilliant scripts ever written swinging between an outrageous and a thought-provoking tone until getting to its point, which is the inspirational denunciation of the hypocrisy governing our world. And freedom of laughing is indeed a way to fight taboos by their own weapons. I did not take Woody Harrelson seriously in the first notes of this brilliant symphony but how wrong I was, he was quite perfect in that role, and I can't go without mentioning Edward Norton as the struggling personal attorney Alan Isaacman, and to conclude Courtney Love in what I consider one of the greatest female performances ever, and I say it again, ONE OF THE GREATEST FEMALE PERFORMANCES EVER, I wonder how she didn't get and win an Oscar. Too trashy? Gimme a break, her devotion and sincere true love towards her husband made Larry's fight so endearing, she was the soul and heart of this film, while Norton was the brain. And Larry was the guts, that despite a tragic handicap was an inspiration to every citizen, to believe in his right to please his basic instincts ... it's basic principles.

And in a way, Flynt had done a great service to his country by desensitizing them about the dirtiness of sex. While many citizens were brainwashed to believe that Wars make heroes, in one of the most obscene masquerades that lead American to an humiliating defeat in Nam, Flynt unmasked the ugly face of American pride to reconcile it, with stuff that reaches a lower level ... only to prove there's no reason to feel guilty about loving harmless stuff just because good society says so. Especially when desensitization from violence can have even more devastating effects.And on a technical level, The People vs. Larry Flynt is certainly one of the most brilliant scripts ever written swinging between an outrageous and a thought-provoking tone until getting to its point, which is the inspirational denunciation of the hypocrisy governing our world. And freedom of laughing is indeed a way to fight taboos by their own weapons. I did not take Woody Harrelson seriously in the first notes of this brilliant symphony but how wrong I was, he was quite perfect in that role, and I can't go without mentioning Edward Norton as the struggling personal attorney Alan Isaacman, and to conclude Courtney Love in what I consider one of the greatest female performances ever, and I say it again, ONE OF THE GREATEST FEMALE PERFORMANCES EVER, I wonder how she didn't get and win an Oscar. Too trashy? Gimme a break, her devotion and sincere true love towards her husband made Larry's fight so endearing, she was the soul and heart of this film, while Norton was the brain. And Larry was the guts, that despite a tragic handicap was an inspiration to every citizen, to believe in his right to please his basic instincts ... it's basic principles.

When I watched the beginning of the film I disappointed because the first forty-five minutes or so seem fairly normal and conventional. There isn't any interesting things . The story follows a happily married couple, Rosemary and a struggling actor Guy, looking for a new apartment. They find a very nice and large apartment that fits them perfectly well but has a rather disturbing history (And how many times have we seen that in movies?). Very soon they meet their new elderly neighbors. Minnie and Roman that seem very friendly, may be a bit too friendly. Soon, Rosemary gets pregnant and the couple celebrates this happening with their dear neighbors that are eager to take very good care of Rosemary and help her out as much as they can. They even talk Rosemary into seeing a doctor of their choosing. She starts to have strange dreams and soon she becomes very suspicious of her neighbors and their helping with the baby. Rosemary and Guy moved a new apartment where some bad things had happened. They wanted to have a baby. Everything begins with rosemary's pregnancy. She becomes alone, helpless, and trapped in her fears .Until the end, we don't know if her suspicions are valid. The main event seems to be the ending. She learns her baby is from Satan. Her husband and neighbors cheated her. In my opinion, this film is different. It isn't quite like any film I have ever seen. It is on the top horror films list but it wasn't scary for me.I think it is a drama instead of a horror.I was affected by Rosemary's physical appearance and also her psychology. At some point you feel pity about her. Even though it finished up with sadness. If one ask me about this movie, I strongly advise it.

But he comes out of prison a changed reformed man and tries to stop his brother (Edward Furlong) going down the same violent path he did. This violent, powerful film shocked many audiences with its brutal truth of white supremacy groups in America.The story is told brilliantly and keeps you feeling very unsettled throughout. The film often showed flashbacks revealing truths about main character Derek's past and how he ended up in prison. The flashbacks are shown in black and white, which I think works very well as it emphasises the darkness of his past. The film deals with some very violent shocking scenes that possibly aren't suitable for small children or in fact some adults. But I felt there needed to be strong violence as it wouldn't have had the same effect.The directing, photography and acting I thought were all flawless. A film that really deserves a lot more credit than it received.
