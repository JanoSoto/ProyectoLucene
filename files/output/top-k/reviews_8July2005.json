American Graffiti is the story of one crucial night in the lives of a group of small-town California teenagers in 1962. It may seem odd that by 1973 one could already make a nostalgia piece about the 1960s. But that is what Lucas has done and it works because as the events in these young people's lives take place the world is very rapidly changing all around them. By 1973 it was easy to look back at the early 1960s as being a much more innocent time, one we very well might wish we could return to.American Graffiti takes its cast of mostly unknowns (most of whom would not remain unknown for long) and gives each character his or her own story to tell. If forced to pick out one character as the lead you'd probably have to go with Ron Howard's Steve, the outgoing class president set to leave for college the next morning. Other key characters include Steve's buddy Curt, as played by Richard Dreyfuss, who is supposed to go to college with Steve but is beginning to have his doubts as to whether he should go. Cindy Williams plays Steve's girlfriend Laurie who is none too happy to be left behind as her boyfriend departs. Charles Martin Smith gives a great performance as hapless Terry The Toad who will have his own adventures with the beautiful Debbie, played by Candy Clark. Harrison Ford has a small but key role as the new guy in town. Mackenzie Phillips does a fine job as Carol, a young girl who would desperately like to hang with the older cool kids such as John Milner, played by Paul Le Mat, who has the fastest car in town. Ah yes, the cars. The cars and the terrific period music are just as much the stars of the movie as any of the actors.Over the period of one night all these characters will be faced with decisions which will in ways, some great and some small, shape their lives. It is very much a movie about coming of age as our characters make the awkward transition into adulthood. Some do it more gracefully than others. Each of their stories is interesting in its own way and all the acting performances are fine. But with the story going in so many different directions at once something gets lost. At times the film struggles to move forward as we're constantly shifting from one character's individual story to another. There are a number of great character studies here and it's fascinating to see these people grow right before our eyes in the span of just one night. However the film probably would have been much crisper and a little more entertaining if the plot was a little more focused. Three or four stories would probably have worked better than seven or eight. Then again all the characters are fascinating in their own way and the acting is so good it would be a shame to have lost any of the performances. Eventually everything comes together and the film is left with what could have been a perfect ending. Unfortunately, it's marred by an unnecessary postscript where we get more information than we need or quite frankly want. Some things are best left to our own imagination. But I guess you make do and appreciate American Graffiti for what it is and not what you might wish for it to have been.

The film focuses on young Josh Baskin (David Moskow) who is humiliated at a carnival for being too short for a ride, when he sees a wish\/fortune telling machine called Zoltar Speaks, and after his wish to be big is granted, he sees the machine was unplugged! The next morning he sees an unfamiliar face in the mirror, he has grown into an adult (Golden Globe winning winning, and Oscar nominated Tom Hanks). When his mother (The Fisher King's Mercedes Ruehl) sees him she believes he is an intruder who has kidnapped, so (after proving his identity) he can only depend on his best friend Billy Kopecki (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' Jared Rushton). They send a form to get information for another Zoltar machine location, but it might take at least 6 weeks. In the meantime Josh manages to get a lowly data-entry job at the MacMillan Toy Company. After meeting the company owner, MacMillan (Independence Day's Robert Loggia) at FAO Schwarz toy store, he impresses him with his childlike enthusiasm for toys, and a memorable duet on the giant electronic foot-operated piano playing Chopsticks and Heart and Soul. Josh is promoted to a dream job being paid simply for testing toys, he also contributes in many discussions for new toy ideas. He soon attracts the attention of beautiful, ambitious fellow toy executive Susan Lawrence (The Flintstones' Elizabeth Perkins), and a romance develops, which annoys the guy she was originally with, Paul Davenport (Home Alone's John Heard). Eventually, the information for another Zoltar machine comes, but Josh is ignoring Billy and sticking with Susan. He knows though that he should go back to his normal childhood life, and after trying to explain his situation to Susan, which she misunderstands and doesn't believe, he wishes he was a normal kid again. It is sad to see them split, but Susan does see Josh go back to normal, and she knows it is right. Also starring Jon Lovitz as Scotty Brennen and Josh Clark as Mr. Baskin. There are plenty a laughs, particularly from the childish behaviour of actors, and Hansk is a terrific performer, an essential film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy\/Musical.

Basically set during World War II, the three Rawlins children, Carrie (Cindy O'Callaghan), Charlie (Ian Weighill) and Paul (Roy Snart) have been evacuated from London to the remote village of Pepperinge Eye. They are placed in the care of reclusive woman Eglantine Price (Golden Globe nominated Angela Lansbury), the children attempt to run away, but change their minds when they spot Miss Price flying a broomstick, they find out she is an apprentice witch. Miss Price explains that she is learning witchcraft to help the British war effort, she and the children make an agreement that they will remain silent about her secret with a spell she gives them, she casts a spell on a bedknob, found by the youngest child Paul, that will cause the bed to take them to any destination they want. Miss Price receives bad news from her teacher that the correspondence school has been forced due to the war to close down, this means she will not receive the final lesson she most wanted, so she convinces Paul to help her travel on the bed, find her teacher and help bring the war to an end. The enchanted bed spell is successful, they find Miss Price's teacher, Professor Emelius Browne (David Tomlinson), he is in fact a charismatic showman who created the course from an old book he found, he is surprised to find out the spells actually work for Miss Price. Mr. Browne gives Miss Price the old book, The Spells of Astaroth, but the final spell she is looking is missing, so the group travel to find the rest of the book in Portobello Road. Petty criminal Swinburne (Bruce Forsyth) overhears they are looking for the book, he takes them to his employer, a mysterious man called the Bookman (Sam Jaffe), who has the other half of the book, but the spell remains missing, it is only engraved on the star always worn by the sorcerer Astaroth. But the Bookman reveals Astaroth kept wild animals who were given human qualities by the sorcerer, they took the star and escaped to somewhere called the Isle of Naboombu, the Bookman has found no evidence the island exists, but Paul found a storybook confirming its existence, so the group escape the Bookman and Swinburne on the enchanted bed to find the island. The bed lands in the lagoon of the island, after swimming with the fish they are flung onto land, and brought before hot- tempered lion ruler King Leonidas, who is wearing the Star of Astaroth, but to get close to it Mr. Browne volunteers to act as referee for a chaotic soccer match, which ends with the king declaring himself the winner. Following the match Mr. Browne cleverly switches the Star of Astaroth with the referee whistle, examining the medallion Miss Price confirms it has the missing spell, Substitutiary Locomotion, Leonidas discovers the theft however and chases them, but Miss Price stops him with her spell that transforms her target into a white rabbit. Back home, Miss Price is ready to experiment with the spell, but the Star has vanished back into the fantasy world it came from, Paul reveals that the spell was in his storybook all the time, Miss Price and the others test the spell, to bring inanimate objects to life, they only end up bringing more than a pair of shoes to life. Local children's refuge supervisor Mrs. Jessica Jessie Hobday (Tessie O'Shea) informs Miss Price that the children can be taken in by another family, but she wants them to stay, and Mrs. Hobday is pleased when she sees they have found a father figure with Mr. Browne, he however is wary of commitment, and he says he must return to London. A platoon of Nazi soldiers land on the coast and invade Miss Price's house, imprisoning her and the children in the local museum, but Mr. Browne comes to their rescue, and they plan to use the Substitutiary Locomotion spell to defeat and scare away the enemy soldiers. In the end however the Nazis commandos destroy Miss Price's workshop, ending her career as a witch, she is happy however that she performed some small service, and realised some time ago she would never be a proper witch, because of her reaction to Poisoned Dragon's Liver, Mr. Browne enlists in the army and leaves escorted by the Home Guard, Paul reveals he still has the magical knob, so they can continue their adventures. Also starring Roddy McDowall as Mr. Jelk, John Ericson as Colonel Heller, Arthur Gould- Porter as Captain Greer, Reginald Owen as General Teagler. Lansbury is likable being dotty, Tomlinson is entertaining enough, and the three young newcomers are alright as the cockney evacuees, the story is easy to follow, and the songs by the Sherman brothers (who also worked on Mary Poppins and The Jungle Book) are fun to sing along to, particularly The Beautiful Briny and Substitutiary Locomotion, the highlights of the film are the animated underwater and jungle football game sequences, all in all it is a fun family part-animated fantasy adventure. It won the Oscar for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Song for The Age of Not Believing and Best Music.

Following the match Mr. Browne cleverly switches the Star of Astaroth with the referee whistle, examining the medallion Miss Price confirms it has the missing spell, Substitutiary Locomotion, Leonidas discovers the theft however and chases them, but Miss Price stops him with her spell that transforms her target into a white rabbit. Back home, Miss Price is ready to experiment with the spell, but the Star has vanished back into the fantasy world it came from, Paul reveals that the spell was in his storybook all the time, Miss Price and the others test the spell, to bring inanimate objects to life, they only end up bringing more than a pair of shoes to life. Local children's refuge supervisor Mrs. Jessica Jessie Hobday (Tessie O'Shea) informs Miss Price that the children can be taken in by another family, but she wants them to stay, and Mrs. Hobday is pleased when she sees they have found a father figure with Mr. Browne, he however is wary of commitment, and he says he must return to London. A platoon of Nazi soldiers land on the coast and invade Miss Price's house, imprisoning her and the children in the local museum, but Mr. Browne comes to their rescue, and they plan to use the Substitutiary Locomotion spell to defeat and scare away the enemy soldiers. In the end however the Nazis commandos destroy Miss Price's workshop, ending her career as a witch, she is happy however that she performed some small service, and realised some time ago she would never be a proper witch, because of her reaction to Poisoned Dragon's Liver, Mr. Browne enlists in the army and leaves escorted by the Home Guard, Paul reveals he still has the magical knob, so they can continue their adventures. Also starring Roddy McDowall as Mr. Jelk, John Ericson as Colonel Heller, Arthur Gould- Porter as Captain Greer, Reginald Owen as General Teagler. Lansbury is likable being dotty, Tomlinson is entertaining enough, and the three young newcomers are alright as the cockney evacuees, the story is easy to follow, and the songs by the Sherman brothers (who also worked on Mary Poppins and The Jungle Book) are fun to sing along to, particularly The Beautiful Briny and Substitutiary Locomotion, the highlights of the film are the animated underwater and jungle football game sequences, all in all it is a fun family part-animated fantasy adventure. It won the Oscar for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Song for The Age of Not Believing and Best Music. It was number 38 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Good!

I felt it was an intelligent action movie (which is generally an oxymoron, especially for Hollywood) with an excellent cast and a good story, but lacked the character development necessary to make it truly great.

The humanistic elements of this story, especially the interaction between the two protagonists (Portman and Reno) leaves the viewer no choice but to feel sympathy and compassion for their plight. This is quite uncommon in film.I cannot believe it got no Academy attention whatsoever (actually it's not so hard to believe with all the politics that go into the choices). I will say that 1994 was an excellent year for film...a year in which the Academy Award winner Forrest Gump was probably the fourth best film behind this one, The Shawshank Redemption, and Pulp Fiction.Anyway, take my word for it.

Basically in Los Angeles in 2019, artificial humans were bioengineered some time ago, these are known as replicants, but after a bloody mutiny on an Off-World Colony replicants were declared illegal, a LAPD cop specialising in detecting replicants, called a Blade Runner, must terminate them, termination is called retirement. Retired police officer Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is detained by officer Gaff (Edward James Olmos) and brought to his former supervisor Bryant (Wild Wild West's M. Emmet Walsh) who informs him that four replicants have escaped and hijacked a ship back to Earth, they are trying to extend their their lifespan. These replicants are Leon Kowalski (Brion James), Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), Zhora (Joanna Cassidy) and Pris (Daryl Hannah), Deckard initially refuses the assignment to retire them, but Bryan threatens him, he reluctantly agrees and carries out a test at Tyrell Corporation used for Nexus-6 models, the assistant of Dr. Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel), experimental replicant Rachael (Sean Young), believes herself to be human, given false memories, but a more extensive test is required. Roy and Leon do their own investigation to find a way to extend their lifespan, which for a replicant is four years, and they learn about genetic designer J.F. Sebastian (William Sanderson), Pris later finds him and manipulates him to gain her trust, Rachael meanwhile visits Deckard herself and tries to prove her humanity, showing him a family photo, but he explains that her memories are implanted, taken from a real person, she leaves in tears. Deckard finds and searches Leon's hotel room, he is then lead to the strip club where Zhora works, he chases and kills her, Bryant then comes and tells him to kill Rachael, who has departed from Tyrell Corporation, he does spot her in a crowd, but is attacked by Leon, until Rachael kills him using Deckard's gun. While Deckard and Rachael return to his apartment where he promises not to hunt her, they share an intimate moment, and he stops her from leaving, meanwhile at Sebastian's apartment Roy tells Pris the others are dead, Sebastian reveals he also has a short lifespan, due to the genetic premature aging disorder Methuselah Syndrome. They go together to see Dr. Tyrell at his penthouse, Roy demands more life from his maker, Tyrell says that this is impossible, dismisses doing questionable things and praising Roy's advanced design and accomplishments in his short life, Roy kisses Tyrell, then kills him, Sebastian manages to escape alone in the elevator. Deckard finds Sebastian's apartment and ambushed by Pris, he manages to kill her just as Roy returns, Roy's body is starting to shut down, he chases Deckard through the building up to the roof, Deckard tries to jump across to another roof, but ends up hanging, Roy jumps across to watch him as his grip loosens, but Roy hoists him onto the roof and saves him. In his last moments of his life Roy delivers a monologue about how his memories are about to be lost (this was improvised by Hauer), Deckard watches silently as Roy dies in front of him. Gaff arrives and shouts to his Deckard, It's too bad she won't live, but then again, who does?, he returns to his apartment and finds Rachael there, depending on the version you are watching, Deckard and Rachael either leave the apartment block to an uncertain future, or drive through an idyllic pastoral landscape. There are three versions of the film to watch the 1982 original, the 1992 Director's Cut (which drops Ford's narration and has a bleaker happy ending), and 2007's The Final Cut (where Scott had complete artistic control, and contains an extended unicorn dream sequence). Ford is really good as the gloomy but determined ex-cop, Young is suitably mysterious, Hauer is exceptional as the nasty android with fake memories of a nonexistent childhood, and the supporting cast members do well also, it is well directed by Scott, and the story is interesting and relatively easy to follow, but what really makes this film ahead of its time is the neon-drenched metropolis, the darkened world full of flying vehicles and cool looking buildings, it is a fantastic futuristic science- fiction thriller. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Visual Effects, it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Production Design\/Art Direction, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing, Best Make Up Artist, Best Score for Vangelis (Chariots of Fire), Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score.

There are three versions of the film to watch the 1982 original, the 1992 Director's Cut (which drops Ford's narration and has a bleaker happy ending), and 2007's The Final Cut (where Scott had complete artistic control, and contains an extended unicorn dream sequence). Ford is really good as the gloomy but determined ex-cop, Young is suitably mysterious, Hauer is exceptional as the nasty android with fake memories of a nonexistent childhood, and the supporting cast members do well also, it is well directed by Scott, and the story is interesting and relatively easy to follow, but what really makes this film ahead of its time is the neon-drenched metropolis, the darkened world full of flying vehicles and cool looking buildings, it is a fantastic futuristic science- fiction thriller. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Visual Effects, it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Production Design\/Art Direction, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing, Best Make Up Artist, Best Score for Vangelis (Chariots of Fire), Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Harrison Ford was number 5 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 74 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 8 on The 100 Greatest Films. Very good!

It's just the most absurd reason to start nuclear war. Yet it also weirdly has a ring of truth. There you are, you're a General in the American Air Force, responsible for thousands of men and the safety of the country, and your sexual prowess slowly begins to ebb away. What do you do? Do you accept it like a normal human being and seek help? Do you just ignore it? Or do you let it drive you mad and then concoct elaborate conspiracy theories to explain your inability to get it up? Ripper certainly goes for the final option. Only this is a man who can drop nuclear bombs and who has an Air Force that can avenge his sexual impotence. The end of the world and the final big bang are his last orgasm.And when you watch the film it's amusing to notice Ripper's two big penis substitutes &#150; his large cigar and his huge gun. He's obviously compensating for his sexual shortcomings. And the excuses he makes are hilarious. I can't help but crack up when he talks about loss of essence, bodily fluids and fatigue. What is the virile American male who's insecure about his sexual potency meant do? Nuke everyone of course! And the phallic symbols aren't only restricted to General Ripper. If the copulating aeroplanes aren't bad enough then there's Major Kong with a huge bomb between his legs. He whoops in orgasmic delight as he fulfils Ripper's revenge by dropping the General's substitute penis on the Russians. That'll teach anyone who laughs at his flaccidity! But staying on the subject of sex in Dr Strangelove, another thing that tickles me is the way that the Nazi, the Commie and the Yank agree that using a mineshaft (snigger, snigger) to have sex with lots of women is a terrific idea. Nothing builds bridges like promises of post-nuclear war orgies. Oh, and I also love the moment when Sellers as Strangelove gazes down at his groin with wide-eyed alarm as his rouge Nazi hand does something off-screen&#133; However, it's not all about sex (although Kubrick rightly shows that most things are about sex). Dr Strangelove is also about the stupidity of authority and the blind way we accept it. I mean, surely if someone is a General or a leader of a nation, they must know what they're doing. They must be right in the head. They must have our best intentions at heart. Right? Of course it's a lot of rubbish. People in power are just as crazy, if not more so, than everyone else. Yet like sheep we all go along with it. Just take how gleefully Kong ensures humanity's demise. He doesn't ask questions, he just goes along for the ride, whooping all the way. And then there are the soldiers forced to fight one another. It's always the ordinary people who end up paying. And how insane is the idea of a nuclear deterrent anyway. Whatever happens no one can win. Whoever fires first, the result is always mutual annihilation. But perhaps Ripper does everyone a favour by ending the insanity with his own brand of madness.As you can probably gather, Ripper is my favourite character. Buck Turgidson, though, would have to be my second. I love his cold rationalism &#150; Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed. But I do say no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops. Uh, depending on the breaks &#150; and his blind, patriotic pride &#150; Does he have a chance? Hell yeah! He's the red blooded American male who's happy to cheat, lie and shout in order to get his way. And he's strangely endearing. Sure he's a loudmouth and he's really not that smart, but like Homer Simpson you just can't help but warm to him. And I also crack up at his prayer. It's very American to talk coldly about carnage and then give thanks to god. And speaking of the fictitious one, I also love the way that Ripper sends his bombers off to nuke Russia and those pesky Commie atheists and then says that God willing we will prevail and in peace and freedom of fear. As always, the religious have a terrific way with hypocrisy.But it would be remiss of me to talk about Dr Strangelove and not mention Peter Sellers. He's magnificent. Each three of his creations is superb. But although Strangelove gets most of the attention, it's probably Mandrake that I like the most. He's just so terribly British. I mean, just take the calm, rather frightened way that he talks to Ripper. And the blasé way that his mentions his torture. And I still crack up when he mentions his gammy leg. He's a sane voice in the mouth of madness.But there's so much that I love about Dr Strangelove and so many moments I could mention. However, it all really comes down to one thing.

What begins as a simple plan to walk in, get the cash and walk out in ten minutes turns into a desperate battle for survival as the cops turn up and the whole thing turns into a hostage situation. There's hardly any cash in the vault anyway as Sonny is given the wrong information, and if that's not disappointing enough, there's a load of irritating women employees and a manager who appear to add tension to the situation by occasionally revealing how much they hate these thieves and making a mockery of their plan. Yet as the film goes on the hostages do begin to sympathise with why they decided to rob their bank and the tension subsides somewhat although the mood is still kept to nerve snapping effect. As the cops move in using family members and other tactics to draw them out you feel that time is running out, and that the chance of the robbers getting away is about a million to one. In their final bid to escape, by holding the hostages at gunpoint and demanding a jet out of the country, it turns to tragedy. How you ask? well I suggest you buy it or tape it or both, heck it's such a good film it's worth it.The tension is excruciating and Pacino is on unbelievable form as the man facing the prison doors or his grave, the mood created by Sidney Lumet is spectacular and the only reason it gets a 9 is because it simply is not as good entertainment as say, Taxi Driver, The Silence of the Lambs or The Godfather. It is no doubt a very good film and I could watch it over and over again, but it does not get a 10. Yet I expect many would give it ten, and they may be right.

Al Pacino is Sonny, a young punk who decides one hot afternoon to rob a bank with his friend Sal so that he can pay for his lover's sex change operation. What begins as a simple plan to walk in, get the cash and walk out in ten minutes turns into a desperate battle for survival as the cops turn up and the whole thing turns into a hostage situation. There's hardly any cash in the vault anyway as Sonny is given the wrong information, and if that's not disappointing enough, there's a load of irritating women employees and a manager who appear to add tension to the situation by occasionally revealing how much they hate these thieves and making a mockery of their plan. Yet as the film goes on the hostages do begin to sympathise with why they decided to rob their bank and the tension subsides somewhat although the mood is still kept to nerve snapping effect. As the cops move in using family members and other tactics to draw them out you feel that time is running out, and that the chance of the robbers getting away is about a million to one. In their final bid to escape, by holding the hostages at gunpoint and demanding a jet out of the country, it turns to tragedy. How you ask? well I suggest you buy it or tape it or both, heck it's such a good film it's worth it.The tension is excruciating and Pacino is on unbelievable form as the man facing the prison doors or his grave, the mood created by Sidney Lumet is spectacular and the only reason it gets a 9 is because it simply is not as good entertainment as say, Taxi Driver, The Silence of the Lambs or The Godfather. It is no doubt a very good film and I could watch it over and over again, but it does not get a 10. Yet I expect many would give it ten, and they may be right.

Flik decides to leave the island, with Princess Atta's (Julia Louis-Dreyfuss) permission, to find warrior bugs to fight the grasshoppers, and to his disbelief, what he brings back is a bunch of circus clowns. These are Slim (David Hyde Pierce) the stick insect, Heimlich (Joe Ranft) the fat German caterpillar, Francis (Small Soldiers' Denis Leary) the ladybird, Manny (Jonathan Harris) the magician bug with assistant Gypsy Moth (Madeline Kahn) and Rosie (Jumanji's Bonnie Hunt) the black widow spider.

His approach to the 2nd novel is not to try and replicate Kubrick's metaphysical bullshit - that'd be fatal, instead Hyams plan was simply to fashion a deep space adventure with enough intellectual weight not to embarrass anyone, least of all Arthur C.Clarke and he certainly achieves as much. Its very conventional stuff compared to 2001 but would it be like urinating in Holy water to suggest that its a damn sight more coherent, character focused and more satisfying as a result?

Firstly, I want to be scared and enjoy the adrenaline rush of the jumps. Secondly, I want to lose myself within some kind of dark fantasy setup. Despite the fact that Scream fails to provide on either, it's a great movie in it's own right, but I think it's time Scream was referred to as what it is, a suspense thriller, and not a balls to the wall horror movie.With that comment out the way, I can say this Scream is the best movie I've seen of it's kind. It has no pretensions to being an out and out horror movie, whereas it's copycats seemed to set out to be scary as hell and fell flat on their faces. The main reason it's such a joy to behold is this lack of pretension. Most modern horror blockbusters make themselves out to be the best thing since sliced bread within the first ten seconds of the trailer. They rarely are. Scream is happy to be Scream, and it doesn't really mind about how scary you find it so long as you're enjoying it.The cast are pretty annoying (par for the course with a Hollywood horror), but since this is a slasher parody that follows the 'cast iron genre rules' it's worth noting that a few of them are roadkill by the end of the movie. However, aggravatingly enough whereas in Fri 13th or Halloween, anyone who's a complete dummy or a lush or whatever will dead cert be on the end of an axe by the movies end, most of the victims in Scream have little or no relation to the greater plot, something that irked me a bit, as you'd know every death was coming because it'd go back to the random person who only just appeared last scene. It almost seemed that Craven and Williams didn't want any of their stars to die (aside from Drew Barrymore, who in the only shock in the movie is fairly unpleasantly slashed to death and hung in the opening sequence). Add to this the fact that most of the deaths had a 'I've had worse' type effect on me (even the aforementioned sequence is relatively non-violent in comparison to a Jason or Freddy film) as opposed to shocking me, and the horror aspect pretty much failed to have any impact on me.Aside from the fact that Scream is only scary if you're 14 (in which case you shouldn't have been watching it anyway lol), and the cast is full of people I've had my fill of (Please, someone cast Matthew Lillard in one of these movies and pickaxe his head in the first five minutes!), Scream has a pretty cool (for the time, it's now been copied to death) plot line, even if I did guess whodunit in the opening sequence. The plot twists around and around, and if you haven't seen a lot of these films, it'll probably throw you for a loop. It's well worth watching just to see the intrigue and mystery unfold.Add to this an original looking killer, some cool black humour, and there's a lot of reasons to watch Scream. It's an enjoyable, unassuming movie with slick production values and a good script and storyline. However, it has got its flaws and I disagree with its classic status. If you're into movies with the 90s\/00s brat pack in them (Drew Barrymore, Matthew Lillard, Neve Campbell etc) you'll love this, and if you want a soft entry into horror, check this out as it's a fine place to start, but I would suggest you check out some real, non Hollywood horror as well, not merely confine yourself to the 'horror revival' genre Scream sits in, as frankly, movies like Maniac Cop, Ginger Snaps and Candyman (all of which come firmly recommended) make sitting through Scream seem like a walk in a happy happy field full of dandelions and bunnies.
