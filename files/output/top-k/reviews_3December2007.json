One has to like the chemistry between a very dapper and young Henry Fonda (Charles Pike) and a very beautiful and young Barbara Stanwyck (Jean Harrington\/Lady Eve). The two worked perfectly together and made a believable couple.For all the chemistry, I must confess that the first half of the movie did little for me. Charles and Jean meet on a cruise from South America to the United States. Unknown to Charles, Jean and her father (Charles Coburn) are con artists who seek to bilk people out of their money in card games. Love, however, intervenes. Jean and Charles fall head over heels, and Jean doesn't want Charles to be cheated. Charles, however, discovers her identity and ends the relationship. I didn't find much funny in this part of the movie. It picks up, however, in the second half. Jean decides to get her revenge by masquerading as an English heiress of some sort; hoping to get Charles to fall for her again and then take his money. The humour picks up here. First, it's hard to tell from scene to scene whether Eve loves Charles or not. Henry Fonda's physical comedy at the dinner (tripping over couches a la Dick Van Dyke) and constantly having food and assorted other things spilled all over him is truly funny, and the scene on the train after they marry, as Eve takes her revenge by telling her new husband about all the men in her life, whom he knew nothing about, got me laughing.I was never clear about the importance of the snake, except to draw some sort of connection between this Eve and the Eve of the biblical creation narrative, although I'm not sure why that connection was necessary to the story.As I said at the outset, this is a pleasant movie, but in my view nothing more than that.

A retarded Indian (Benicio del Toro) is picked up for the crime. Del Toro has a record of child abuse and other offenses, some physical evidence linking him to the girl is found in the cab of his truck, an eyewitness places him at the scene of the killing, and under coaxing he confesses. Then he grabs a gun and shoots himself. The horrified Nicholson doesn't believe the confession and thinks Del Toro was innocent. He pledges to the dead girl's parents that he'll find the killer. Nicholson settles into an old café. Soon a beautiful younger woman (Robin Wright Penn) and her daughter move in with him and they become a family. The problem is that Penn's daughter is a beautiful eight-year-old girl child who reminds Nicholson of the murder victim. He goes to such unusual lengths to protect her from the killer he believes to be still at large and operating in the vicinity that he alienates his friends on the police force and drives Penn and her daughter away. He uses the girl as bait to trap the rapist who, the film suggests, was killed in a highway accident while hurrying to meet and harm the girl. Of course, no one realizes that the charred corpse in the burning car is the rapist, and that Nicholson's anxiety was justified. The last scene has a half-mad, fainéant Nicholson sitting in the dust in front of his now-dilapidated and ruined café, drunk, gesticulating wildly and talking to himself -- a lone and tragic figure in the wind.I was unable to figure out what all the fuss was about. I don't mind tragedies but they have to develop out of something, don't they? Nicholson promises to catch the killer\/rapist. He does what he can, even at the risk of his own family, and he appears to succeed, though he doesn't know it, and it costs him everything he has. Where is his tragic flaw? His downfall, like the car accident that kills the rapist, seems entirely arbitrary. It doesn't flow out of anything that has preceded it. Okay, let Nicholson fall, but give us a reason for it, some hamartia -- Othello's jealousy or Caesar's ambition -- even on a small scale. But what do we carry away from this film? Don't make promises you can't keep? Sometimes a film can get away with this kind of diffuse narrative if it's handled stylishly. (I still have to concentrate in order to figure out the plot of Chinatown.) But this isn't handled with any kind of artistry. The director, Sean Penn, sets the story in and around Reno but we get no sense of place. Reno is a raffish, vulgar little city. The surroundings, the Great Basin Desert and the Sierra Nevada, are raw and majestic. But, aside from a few shots of Nicholson fishing, we don't get much of an impression of it. I'm not asking for pretty postcards, just some atmosphere.Nicholson gives a performance that is slow and stiff or, let's say, thoughtful, but mostly he's Jake Gittes with a hangover. Robin Wright Penn is more animated, perhaps the liveliest person in the movie, and she's just about the right age. The little girl is enchanting, like a painting of a beautiful child, and she seems like a natural actress. Other actors of note have small roles that don't add much. But Benicio Del Toro is great as the barely interpretable Indian, his face mostly hidden by a voluminous witch-like growth of hair.Penn seems to love close ups. There are a plenitude of close up. Not just close ups of faces, but close ups of eyes and close ups of noses and close ups of ornaments dangling from rear-view mirrors. There's a close up of a hook being removed from a trout's mouth. Is claustrophobia supposed to be a THEME of some sort? The motivations are weak as well. What is it that convinces Nicholson's cop that Del Toro is innocent? And why does Nicholson so stupidly swear on a home-made cross, pledge your soul's salvation, that he will catch the killer? When Nicholson learns from the little girl that she has made a date with the wizard who gives her bon-bons, he lets her bicycle to the picnic site, and then surrounds it with policemen, including a SWAT team. At no time is she in any danger. So why does this drive Robin Wright Penn into hysterics so that she beats Nicholson, clutches her wailing daughter, and leaves him flat? Why doesn't she just heap her calumny upon him. Or make him take ANOTHER pledge on a home-made cross that he'll never do it again.The film is sluggish and unenlightening. The story remains an interesting promise, unfulfilled.

Inside, the guests are crowding in for an unexpectedly cramped night after an avalanche delays the train that is to take many of them away. There's nothing ominous in this however, as the guests seem mostly filled with good cheer and petty arguments over accommodations and noise-making. Nothing ominous until a sinister hand reaches out and silences the singer to whom Dame May Witty as governess Miss Froy is paying rapt attention....And so begins one of Hitch's best known British thrillers. Like The Man Who Knew Too Much this suffers a bit from slightly excessive exposition, though it's more entertaining this time 'round, and more obviously significant to the story to come. Miss Froy and several other guests we've been introduced to, including a somewhat snotty young woman (Margaret Rutherford) returning to England to be married, a musicologist and linguist who quickly becomes infatuated with her (Michael Redgrave) and a couple of rather gay cricket enthusiasts (Naunton Wayne and Basil Radford), soon board the train that is to take them out of the country, and into mystery as Miss Froy suddenly disappears and leaves the young woman wondering if she's insane as the rest of the passengers act as if they've never seen her.It's murder and spies, and the film builds in excitement to an extended shoot-out and standoff in the woods, in which the worst excesses of Hitchcock's overt patriotism and the none-too-subtle allegory about pacifism in the face of the oncoming war come to the front. Cecil Parker's Eric Todhunter has been a cad throughout the film, but in the last scenes his cowardice proves deadly and we can almost see Hitch smirking in satisfaction.That doesn't ruin the film, which is full of rich characterizations and wonderful set-pieces like the scene in the magician's baggage car, but it does cheapen the effect and date the film somewhat, and for me it's a major reason why I can't place it among Hitchcock's very best.

Cecil Parker's Eric Todhunter has been a cad throughout the film, but in the last scenes his cowardice proves deadly and we can almost see Hitch smirking in satisfaction.That doesn't ruin the film, which is full of rich characterizations and wonderful set-pieces like the scene in the magician's baggage car, but it does cheapen the effect and date the film somewhat, and for me it's a major reason why I can't place it among Hitchcock's very best.

Inside, the guests are crowding in for an unexpectedly cramped night after an avalanche delays the train that is to take many of them away. There's nothing ominous in this however, as the guests seem mostly filled with good cheer and petty arguments over accommodations and noise-making. Nothing ominous until a sinister hand reaches out and silences the singer to whom Dame May Witty as governess Miss Froy is paying rapt attention....And so begins one of Hitch's best known British thrillers.

Mel Gibson takes the main role this time around and delivers an enjoyably mean performance as a ruthlessly single-minded anti-hero. Payback had a rather chequered production history, and it is somewhat surprising that the finished article emerges as stylish and well-made as it does. Generally-speaking, though, this is a film with plenty going for it.Tough crook Porter (Mel Gibson), aided by his wife Lynn (Deborah Kara Unger) and partner Val Resnick (Gregg Henry), steals money from a Chinese Triad gang. Later, Porter is betrayed by his accomplices &#150; his wife shoots him in the back, and she and Resnick take off with the loot. Porter survives the shooting and some while later returns to the streets of Chicago to get back his money. He doesn't want revenge, he doesn't even want the entire sum from the robbery &#150; just his half of the heist, a seemingly paltry $70,000. Having tracked down Resnick, Porter learns that his former partner-in-crime has used the money to pay his way into a crime organisation called the Outfit. Resnck claims that he can't get the cash back, so with methodical ruthlessness Porter works his way up the criminal food chain in his quest to retrieve his money. First on the list is crime lord Carter (William Devane); later the urbane Fairfax (James Coburn); eventually the stakes get so high that the head honcho Bronson (Kris Kristofferson) has to get involved. Porter is hunted by enemies on all sides &#150; and can only trust his loyal hooker friend Rosie (Maria Bello) &#150; as he closes in on his seventy grand.It's wonderfully ironic how any of the crime lords that Porter comes across during the movie could pay him his money with ease. At one point, Fairfax guffaws in disbelief that Porter could possibly be going to such lengths for such a small amount of money &#150; Seventy grand! he scoffs. Hell, my suits cost more than that! The character of Porter is a thief with his own moral code &#150; what he steals becomes his, and he intends to collect whatever is due him! The film is shot through in bleached colour, giving it a grey and grainy appearance reminiscent of the hard-boiled crime capers of the 60s and 70s. It's an effective and atmospheric touch. Parts of the film are slightly too-stylized and damage the gritty tone &#150; most of the sequences featuring Lucy Liu and her Triad buddies, for example. But there are other moments that are judged very well indeed. Porter's brief and brutal meeting with Carter; the original robbery of the money from the Triad; an electrifying torture scene during which Porter has his toes mutilated by a hammer-wielding lackey; and the explosive ending during which our anti-hero turns the tables on his adversaries from a seemingly hopeless situation. While not perfect by any means, Payback is a solid thriller that delivers the goods. It also marks a welcome switch from the occasional sentimentality that can be found in some of Gibson's 90s films back to the raw, unapologetic style of his Mad Max movies.

The majority of such productions are known for taking significant liberties with the work, mainly in terms of length and editing. And such is the main selling point for director\/star Kenneth Branagh's incarnation of the tragic prince of Denmark the work is presented unabridged and unashamed of it, and as such, is one of the most unquestionably faithful Shakespearian cinematic adaptations as of yet. Considered by many to be the definitive film version of the play, Branagh's Hamlet is by no means a flawless film, but a powerful and faithful enough work to merit a viewing. Branagh's passion and keep grasp on his source material is evident, as is the astute evidence paid to even the most minute details of the sprawling work. To take a four hour long (the sheer length in itself will unquestionably be enough to deter some viewers either from taking in the film or watching it in a single sitting) Shakespearian play and infuse it with enough zest and energy to keep it interesting for a contemporary audience is no small feat indeed, but to his credit, Branagh performs such a task admirably. The film's mostly strong, but somewhat uneven pacing, including some quintessential contextual flashback sequences, intriguing cinematography and Patrick Doyle's rousing (if slightly overdone) musical score are engaging, and benefit the film immensely. The period adaptation, to 1890s civil war era works surprisingly well, considering the many less than favourable attempts to adapt Shakespearian dramas into a contemporary time period, (Baz Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet comes disconcertingly to mind...) and the vibrant and expansive period sets and costumes are visually delightful, adding a sense of epic splendour to the production. However, considering Branagh's considerable talent and directorial attentiveness, it is a shame indeed that the production still feels like it is missing something, or falling tantalisingly short of the emotional depth and breadth one might hope for in one of Shakespeare's more emotional works. A disappointing number of the film's key emotional moments either come across as disappointingly flat or toeing the line of melodramatic hysteria, though for the most part, Branagh keeps the emotional tension to an appropriate simmer. Also, for such a dialogue intensive work, many of the actors' delivery feels overly stagey, frequently drawing the audience out of the emotional intensity of the moment. However, despite such complaints, on the whole the film performs admirably - it is only a slight disappointment that there is a consistent feel of the full (admittably vast) potential not quite being filled. In such a dramatic work as Hamlet, the performances are key, and thankfully, Branagh has played his cards right by assembling a stellar cast to bring his vision to life. As the title character himself, Branagh manages a precisely poised balance between the brooding, flamboyant and lethal aspects of the character. His careful research and preparation show through his deliberately crafted performance (even his forays into the melodramatic tend to infuse the often imbalanced character with a fitting unusual edge) - it would be difficult to imagine an overall more satisfying Hamlet. Kate Winslet is easily one of the film's strongest points, typically powerful, charismatic and tremendously impressive as the harried Ophelia, Hamlet's love interest. Derek Jacobi gives a strong performance as the Machiavellian King Claudius, infusing the role with the necessary depth to make Claudius a troubled and lamenting character rather than a one dimensional antagonist. As Hamlet's troubled mother Gertrude, Julie Christie, years after her initial call to fame, demonstrates her ability to still craft elegant, credible and tremendously powerful performances. Richard Briers makes for an excellent Polonius, but unfortunately Nicholas Farrell and Michael Maloney prove miscast with little charisma and tendencies to overact as Horatio and Laertes respectively. Branagh also makes use of a supporting cast chock full of famous faces to both keep viewers interested and instill intrinsic value into characters that might otherwise be considered inconsequential. Billy Crystal is perfectly cast as the comic relief Gravedigger, and Robin Williams and Jack Lemmon are put to good use in minuscule yet nonetheless amusing roles as Osric and Marcellus. Brian Blessed is a formidable presence as the Ghost of Hamlet's father, and Charlton Heston and Rosemary Harris are endearing in the Player interlude. Also, unseen in the abridged cut of the production are entertaining cameos from Gerard Dépardieu, Richard Attenborough and Judi Dench.Shakespeare aficionados will have much to appreciate, as Branagh's passion for his source material and distinct directorial touch help carry the film through its regrettable weaker moments and occasional lapses in emotional poignancy and acting. While the staggering running time and period dialogue will doubtlessly prove too daunting for those unaccustomed to the works of Shakespeare, those willing to make the investment will find Branagh's work to be among the most faithful and entertaining film adaptations of the Bard's works.

Considering the tremendous ambition of the task, Branagh's film, while by no means perfect, should still be considered nothing less than a laudable success. -8\/10 ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"3 December 2007","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" A cycle of terror ...Every month, when the moon is at its fullest, the usually quiet town of Tarker's Mills is visited by what the townspeople think is a homicidal maniac.

","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"3 December 2007","score":"5 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Bob and Jill Lawrence are a middle-class English couple on holiday in Switzerland; Jill is a crack shot and narrowly loses a competition because of interference from their beloved daughter, but this doesn't stop the Lawrences from doing everything possible to save their daughter when she is kidnapped by a group of spies planning an assassination that the Lawrences have accidentally learned about. The first quarter or so of the movie didn't really move all that well, a bit too much cuteness and exposition given the short running time, but once the locale shifts to London and Bob decides to take matters into his own hands the plot quickens and the film picks up considerably. The dentist-chair scene is as riveting as anything in Hitchcock's British filmography, and Peter Lorre is commanding as the leader of the desperate would-be assassins. I particularly liked the novelty of having a great knock-down, drag-out fight with chairs and pews in a church, and the atmosphere of the interiors in the old hideaway house, with the (expected and foreshadowed) reappearance of crack-shot Jill's talents make for a taut and thrilling finish. A bit more judicious editing and this might well have been a great one; as it is, well worth seeing for Hitchcock or Lorre fans.

The opening scene begins with a darkening minor bass-horn which produces a cold, mysterious, and empty atmosphere. The viewer sees a mega-mansion in the background perched on top of a hill with a luminous light spilling out through an open window. As images of the mansion move closer and closer towards the window, the music crescendo's louder and louder and finally climaxes with a sudden bass\/drum roll as the light turns off inside. The tension and release of the parallel music here suggests that something dramatic has, or is about to take place inside that room. It is a musical cue to what the viewer is about to uncover&#151;that is, the light of the world's largest newspaper tycoon has just turned off, or died. Diegetic and non-diegetic music is used frequently throughout the film to help convey the rise of Kane's empire of selfishness, his attraction for money and power, his manipulation on public opinion, and the pollution of his family. A diegetic song written specifically to hail Kane as a great newspaper publisher is sung during a banquet party his staff throws for him. Here Kane is seen as the center of attention as he dances with a group of women who flower over him and sing praises to his name. This song expressly demonstrates the rise of Kane's egotism. Even earlier in the film during the news reel sequence, a tapestry of events from Kane's life is displayed with non-diegetic drums and pompous horns to help reflect Kane's smugness towards money and power. During a time-lapsed sequence over Kane eating breakfast with his first wife, both mickey-mousing and non-diegetic elements are used to heighten the disintegration of his first marriage. Fast-paced camera swipes (accompanied with the tingling of bells and strings) are mickey-moused with the progression of each scene&#151;showing the further decay of their marriage each time. The non-diegetic music becomes more and more morose to enhance and foreshadow the inevitable divorce. Sound is also used to capture the empty and regretful life of Kane. During a particular scene with his second wife constructing a jigsaw puzzle, he engages her in a shallow conversation about not wanting to move to New York. As he walks through the immensely spacious halls of the mansion, their voices are heard deeply echoing off the empty and lonely walls&#151;giving the impression of isolation. This diegetic sound is to reflect Kane's inner emptiness and loss of personal childhood innocence to the debauchery of materialism. Sound becomes dramatic and crucial in the scene where Kane's second wife leaves him. As he tears apart the materialized and wealthy room he has built for her, foley sounds are heard emphasizing the crashing of chairs and shelves, and the ripping of pillows and blankets. The sound increasing here reflects Kane's retrospective regret in all that he has lost and also that which was most dear to him. The intensity of these sounds then contrasts perfectly when he picks up the snow-globe&#151;all sounds vanish. In the midst of silence, the viewer then hears a faint and muffled, Rosebud, from Kane's mouth. The sound of this word resonates with the viewer; echoing forth Kane's long-lost childhood to when he was first taken from the innocence and youth of his home and forced into the scandalous and corrupt world of politics and media.
