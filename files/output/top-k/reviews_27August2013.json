He uses great visual techniques and editing to move the story along at a breakneck speed. The film score is basically techno music, but it fits the mood and feel of the film perfectly. And then there is Potente, she has such great charisma and presence that you can't help but be drawn in and cheer for her.

I just watched Memento last night and was looking at other reviews. I might not have wrote my own but there are way to many people just over rating this movie. Yes was a it good to watch yea. Unique sort of. I know this film was made a while back but the backward story telling or puzzle story telling has been done before. Many have sighted Pulp Fiction. This is just a story telling tool and whether it has been done before or not is not the point. Was it done well. Yes. It also suited the getting into the POV of the main characters head. For this the movie was very well done.As far as acting it is hard to grade for me. Short scenes leave little chance to truly show off what talent may or may not be there. Over all you do get a sense of the chars but its really just a superficial view of them. I think this was done on purpose by the film maker to hide what comes next. Did the actors fit their roles yes but they fit their roles for the moment. The moment of each scene. You see what they are like in that moment in time before who they really are is revealed. This works for the first half the movie and once you figure out things they seem more like actors just saying lines. The true trick or gimmick is not the backward story telling but the fact that every scene... wait spoiler... is built upon illusions and lies. From the very first scenes on is all a series of lies and illusions. This is what actually is very well done and different, because even in lies there is truth. However by the time you get half way through the movie you already figured out where these lies will lead and how they lead back to the first scene. To me there was no major plot twist it was just now following the trail to see how it plays out. This to me is were the film begins to lag and no longer holds any suspense. Two thoughts on this. One is that really in the end the actual story was a weak plot. There was nothing to the story but questions. This could be what the film maker wanted. What is real what is not. Who is not telling the truth who is. Or maybe they are all telling a bit of the truth. Maybe its Leonard who is not facing the truth. That the truth is to hard to face so he creates his own. Or that the world is nothing but the lies which we want to believe. Maybe a mix of it all. OK so it makes you think but I was thinking this half way through the movie. We do get hints that maybe the Leonard and Sammy are one but nothings really answered. Leonard manipulates his world by what he wants to believe by writing it down. Others manipulate him into believing things are not what they seem.It is the ending which I believe is the let down. We are filled with not only the suppose twist with Teddy and what he tells Leonard but we are left with who is telling the truth. All we are left with is that Leonard actually doesn't want to know the truth. This leaves the viewer sitting through 2 hours of film that from the very start the main char is seeking the truth that he never really wants to know in the end. He killed the only one who perhaps knew the truth at the start of the movie. How ironic.One more note. My opinion is the black and white scenes are Leonard's lies he is creating to hide what happened and the color scenes are the lies or half truths the world is showing him. Otherwise he remembers his lies or what he wants to and the color scenes is what the world unveils to him. He reconstructs his world with what he writes down. Unique, different but I would not say brilliant. Good beginning but fades and becomes predictable in the end. You realize the question the film maker is asking and that he isn't going to tell you half way through the film. Writing for first half 10 second half 6. Plot 7. Did it keep me on the edge. 5 Overall I give it a 7 because I liked it. Its is a movie you have to see once just not the type I would see again.

Don't mistake my 8 for this being a cinematic masterpiece. But as one of the all time great Stallone fans I found this indubitably entertaining. It has a masterful performance of a villain (James Woods), a ton of ridiculous campy one liners, an equally campy and gratuitous red light sex scene that tries to channel 9 1\/2 Weeks and Stallone being...Stallone. It was ridiculously campy and perfectly entertaining. Anyone that goes into this expecting any more than what it provides went in with ridiculous expectations. It has plenty of action, a ton of explosions, an appropriately cheesy 80's-esque storyline and the first 20 minutes is Stallone doing what he does best. The scene of him on the bus busting hooligans heads so that a woman can have a bus seat...random and awesome all at once. On the surface and by all accounts it really a terrible movie but look at it from a sheer fun and cheese factor. I don't think I had ever watched it before and it was just completely entertaining.If you love Sylvester Stallone like I do then you know what to expect from him. In The Specialist he is a quiet brooding explosions expert who becomes obsessed with his latest client. Stallone grunts and says a few one liners and kills people the way we love him to do. He is good in the role and while it doesn't stretch his acting ability by any means, it was a good role for him. Sharon Stone...man is she awful. I don't recall seeing her in anything where she impressed me. She was certainly sexy in this but her melodramatic performance is laughable. The chemistry with her and Stallone is pretty good...I actually think they're one random completely gratuitous sex scene was at least almost hot. She is definitely one of the weaker points of this film but she pulls off the role just barely. James Woods might be the number one reason to watch this movie. This isn't a new role for him, in fact I felt like I'd seen him do this before but he was great at it. He plays a maniacal former CIA operative and bomb expert who is now working private security for a mobster. He is ruthless, fast talking and downright evil. He is brilliant in this role!! He is the perfect adversary for Stallone. Eric Roberts has a small role as the sleazy son of the mob boss. Roberts is good...he plays sleazy well and the best scenes are his interactions with Woods but he is mostly expendable (no pun I swear) and doesn't make a big impression. The legendary Rod Steiger is the mob boss himself. Steiger doesn't have a huge role but he has some solid scenes (again the best of which are opposite Woods) but something about him and his charisma commands attention on screen.Director Luis Llosa isn't exactly a household name. He has had some okay films under his belt including Anaconda and Sniper and has worked with some big names with those films and this one. He seems content to stay in the realm of average. I think he probably let Stallone, Woods and Stone do what they do best and let the story unfold. The story is actually very good and was actually considered one of the best scripts in circulation in Hollywood before it was made. It has lots of twists and turns and enough explosions to keep any action fan happy. Its a drama, its a romance, its a baby-blue type erotic thriller, and its an action flick. If you don't see it for what it is then you will certainly be disappointed. Nothing about it is amazing (with the exception of maybe Woods) but everything about it is entertaining. It was a good time and it thoroughly filled my Stallone quota so for that reason I am scoring it a solid 8.

John Wayne gives one of his finest performances amongst his 150 movie roles in director John Ford's landmark western. Wayne walks a fine line between good and bad, heroic and reckless, as Ethan Edwards, an embittered confederate soldier who returns home from years of fighting in the civil war. e is a burned out loner, full of pain and anger, which is only further fuelled by the brutal massacre of his family at the hands of a Comanche tribe.Before the likes of The Man With No Name and Mad Max, Ethan Edwards was the ultimate symbol of an anti-hero. He is a dark and complex creation with inner demons. And yet he doesn't have one single scene of exposition where he talks about himself in any detail. He doesn't recount one painful experience in his life prior to returning home. He shows it purely through his expressions and attitude.As the far as the plot of the film goes, it's practically paper thin but the characters and the themes are from simple. It's by far one of the most multi-layered films I've seen. The story is set over five years as Ethan sets off on a never-ending search to try and retrieve his kidnapped niece at the hands of the Comanches and take his revenge. Ethan's obsessive quest gradually becomes darker as he battles against the wilderness, hunger, thirst, heat, cold and last but not least his nephew Martin (Jeffrey Hunter) who joins him on the long trek.One of the best aspects of the film is the relationship between these two characters, which in a way is the heart of the story. Martin is a quarter Comanche himself, so from the very beginning upon meeting him, Ethan has an instant dislike for the young man. Gradually as the pair travel together, their relationship is as hot and cold as the weather changes they face. It constantly changes between hatred, respect and affection as Ethan gradually finds some humanity throughout the journey.The film is one of the most analysed in the history of cinema, with many different interpretations of the characters motivations and back stories. For instance at the beginning of the film, we know instantly that Ethan is in love with his brother's wife. But nothing is said, we can just tell from their actions and body language. But we don't know if anything has happened between them. That's one of the most impressive things about a film that's 57 years old. It is so subtle and achieves different meanings and interpretations on subsequent viewings.It's easily one of the bleakest and most brutal westerns in terms of the events that occur throughout the story. And yet visually it's far from violent. Children are kidnapped, young women are raped and murdered, and men are shot and burned but hardly any of these despicable acts are actually shown. Ford proves that less is more. In 1957 because of the strict censorship, Ford obviously wouldn't have been allowed to show a lot of these moments but I have a feeling that even if the censors would have allowed it, he would still have filmed it in this way. Leaving the acts of violence to the viewer's imagination is much more powerful and unsettling.Because of the dark themes of the story, Ford chose to balance the tone out with some humour. The sub-plot involves Martin's on\/off relationship with a woman who is impatiently waiting for him to return home so that they can settle down together. Apart from providing some comedy, I think this situation is a nice parallel of Ethan and Martha's relationship, and contrast his present loneliness. The fact that Ethan has lost the love of his life and his inner turmoil may prevent him from having an happy future like Martin. Or if Martin loses his woman he may end up like Ethan. Forever an outsider. As the story goes on, Ethan finds some of his humanity, and it isn't portrayed in a typical Hollywood magical transformation. Instead it's a more real gradual progression, and by the end he isn't a completely different person, just a less angry one with a less prejudiced outlook on people. It's a great character arc. Ford definitely created a classic here. It deserves it's status. The likes of Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese cite it as one of the greatest films ever made and they're right. It's a visually stunning movie. The scenery is majestic. You could freeze frame many camera shots in the film and imagine it been a picture on your wall. The cinematography is so eye-catching and gorgeous. It's a masterpiece in film-making and storytelling, touching on a very dark subject matter that's wrapped up in visual beauty.

Martin is a quarter Comanche himself, so from the very beginning upon meeting him, Ethan has an instant dislike for the young man. Gradually as the pair travel together, their relationship is as hot and cold as the weather changes they face. It constantly changes between hatred, respect and affection as Ethan gradually finds some humanity throughout the journey.The film is one of the most analysed in the history of cinema, with many different interpretations of the characters motivations and back stories. For instance at the beginning of the film, we know instantly that Ethan is in love with his brother's wife. But nothing is said, we can just tell from their actions and body language. But we don't know if anything has happened between them. That's one of the most impressive things about a film that's 57 years old. It is so subtle and achieves different meanings and interpretations on subsequent viewings.It's easily one of the bleakest and most brutal westerns in terms of the events that occur throughout the story. And yet visually it's far from violent. Children are kidnapped, young women are raped and murdered, and men are shot and burned but hardly any of these despicable acts are actually shown. Ford proves that less is more. In 1957 because of the strict censorship, Ford obviously wouldn't have been allowed to show a lot of these moments but I have a feeling that even if the censors would have allowed it, he would still have filmed it in this way. Leaving the acts of violence to the viewer's imagination is much more powerful and unsettling.Because of the dark themes of the story, Ford chose to balance the tone out with some humour. The sub-plot involves Martin's on\/off relationship with a woman who is impatiently waiting for him to return home so that they can settle down together. Apart from providing some comedy, I think this situation is a nice parallel of Ethan and Martha's relationship, and contrast his present loneliness. The fact that Ethan has lost the love of his life and his inner turmoil may prevent him from having an happy future like Martin. Or if Martin loses his woman he may end up like Ethan. Forever an outsider. As the story goes on, Ethan finds some of his humanity, and it isn't portrayed in a typical Hollywood magical transformation. Instead it's a more real gradual progression, and by the end he isn't a completely different person, just a less angry one with a less prejudiced outlook on people. It's a great character arc. Ford definitely created a classic here. It deserves it's status. The likes of Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese cite it as one of the greatest films ever made and they're right. It's a visually stunning movie. The scenery is majestic. You could freeze frame many camera shots in the film and imagine it been a picture on your wall. The cinematography is so eye-catching and gorgeous. It's a masterpiece in film-making and storytelling, touching on a very dark subject matter that's wrapped up in visual beauty.

John Wayne gives one of his finest performances amongst his 150 movie roles in director John Ford's landmark western. Wayne walks a fine line between good and bad, heroic and reckless, as Ethan Edwards, an embittered confederate soldier who returns home from years of fighting in the civil war. e is a burned out loner, full of pain and anger, which is only further fuelled by the brutal massacre of his family at the hands of a Comanche tribe.Before the likes of The Man With No Name and Mad Max, Ethan Edwards was the ultimate symbol of an anti-hero. He is a dark and complex creation with inner demons. And yet he doesn't have one single scene of exposition where he talks about himself in any detail. He doesn't recount one painful experience in his life prior to returning home. He shows it purely through his expressions and attitude.As the far as the plot of the film goes, it's practically paper thin but the characters and the themes are from simple. It's by far one of the most multi-layered films I've seen. The story is set over five years as Ethan sets off on a never-ending search to try and retrieve his kidnapped niece at the hands of the Comanches and take his revenge.

The tale is simple enough... a handsome, boyish aristocrat courting alcoholism and marriage at the same time inherits a large fortune following his father's death. This requires him to take a house in London and, with the house, a manservant to run things. Enter Dirk Bogarde's Barrett, who initially seems innocuous enough. Sharp witted, polished and able, Barrett takes charge of all his master's domestic details with aplomb and the partnership between the two seems at first to go off swimmingly. Quickly enough, though, the contempt felt for Barrett by the master's fiancée (Wendy Craig as the implacably shrewish Susan) sets things on a dangerous downward path leading James Fox's Tony, by degrees, into an inferno of self destruction.The acting is uniformly superb. Bogarde is a marvel, as usual... here he is sly, devilish, calculating several moves ahead of his putative boss as he engineers a quiet and invidious sort of mayhem. Sarah Miles plays a seemingly idiotic coquette who exercises total command of the proceedings behind a succession of cunning masks. James Fox handles his transformation from n'eer do well gentleman to something out of a painting by Goya or Francis Bacon with great finesse.The cinematography and editing are beautiful and greatly contribute to the strained and intensely suspenseful atmosphere pervading this movie. The only weak point in the whole thing, and it is a minor weakness, is the overuse of one song throughout the movie. The producers should have splurged a bit more on the music or kept it more unobtrusive.I think The Servant was the inspiration, at least partly, for several other works I previously enjoyed.

Then there are the great genre films, which work within their genre confines while expanding the boundaries for genre films to come.Such is the police procedural The French Connection.The streets of New York City have been bone-dry of heroin for some time, but vice detective Jimmy Popeye Doyle (Gene Hackman) has his eye out for a big score. He sets his sights on a candy-store owner named Boca (Tony Lo Bianco). Boca, it turns out, has a connection in Marseilles who is offering 60 kilos of junk for a half-million dollars. Can Popeye and his team catch Boca before his connection catches the next ship home?For a cop movie, The French Connection moves rather differently. Exposition is held to a minimum as we spend the first half of the movie watching stake-outs and tailings, often playing in conjunction with Don Ellis' moody, jazzy score. We watch Popeye and his partner Cloudy Russo (Roy Scheider) roust bar patrons and tangle with federal agents, but we don't get long conversations or scenes where someone explains what it's all about.When French Connection came out, this confused a lot of people. MAD magazine did a parody where a character we see meet an unfortunate end at the outset keeps coming back and asking Yeah, but WHAT'S the connection? Even now, there are those who say the film is too confusing and others who say everything that happens on screen makes sense to anyone paying attention.They're both wrong. French Connection is a film of stylish misdirection, keeping you guessing because you aren't supposed to be that clued in. Director William Friedkin is doing his own version of Popeye's famous pick-your-feet-in-Poughkeepsie rant on us, playing us to expect one thing when we get something else. The result makes for lively, smart entertainment.The film's big scene is where this all pays off Popeye's famous chase, of a secondary character named Nicoli (Marcel Bozzuffi) through the crowded streets of the city, Popeye in a borrowed car, Nicoli on an elevated train. It's a fine sequence in isolation, but really takes off in context with the rest of the movie, where we've been kept waiting and watching for something to break for an hour, feeling as stifled as Popeye and Cloudy in their stakeout car.Friedkin in the DVD commentary talks about working with both French New Wave influences and documentary-style pacing, trying to make each moment as real as possible. This could be deadly except for the strong acting on display. Hackman earned an Academy Award for sheer intensity, making every moment on screen as visceral as possible.The actors around him are great, especially Scheider and Fernando Rey as the very cool lead villain, a Corsican boatyard operator who confesses to an associate at one point that I haven't done an honest day's work since I climbed off the crane. It's fun watching Popeye getting hosed down all the time by his superior, played by Eddie Egan who was Popeye for all practical purposes in the real case. Egan and other real people are integrated so smoothly into the film you think they're method actors, too.The film plays fast and loose with reality at times. From the roof of a tall building, Doyle watches someone running across a street at the end of one shot, and is running after him just yards away in the next. A famous scene with a car in a garage has left generations of viewers asking the simple question How? But if you accept this as part of Friedkin's effective gamesmanship, you are amply rewarded with riveting, believable entertainment.What's the connection? the guy in MAD wanted to know.

How true to life it is, or how well it works as a standalone movie? I ask because if A Beautiful Mind is judged by the first criterion, it fails pretty badly on many counts. We are provided with a watered down, glammed-up version of the life of John Nash, cutting out many of the 'gory details'. If we take the second criterion, it's a masterpiece, proof (as if we needed it) of how good Ron Howard is as a director, and how well Russell Crowe can act.The movie tells the life story of economist John Nash, whom we first meet when he starts at Princeton. He is socially awkward, bullied in part by his fellow students, and spends all of his time trying to come up with some original work. The only person he seems to get on with is his roommate, played by Paul Bettany, and the two characters spend a lot of great scenes with each other. After Princeton, he works for the US government as a codebreaker and at MIT. He meets Alicia, who goes on to become his wife, but is becoming too infatuated with his 'government work', with Ed Harris' character constantly on his case.I only summarise the plot in this much detail because there is a point, around the hour mark, where we discover that a large portion of it isn't real. John is really a paranoid schizophrenic, and a few of the characters are mere figments of his imagination. I went into the film knowing this in part, and guessed fairly early on that one of the characters wasn't real using 'Sixth Sense' logic (doesn't actually interact with anyone except the delusional character). The other main one completely astounded me. This is even more of a credit to Howard, since he makes the aftermath of the reveal even more interesting and shocking than the reveal itself. One of the great parts of having a fairly early twist is that the rest of the film is very unexpected, and keeps taking you to surprising places. I won't say much more, because going into this film without many spoilers makes it even better.Watching the film, I wondered why Russell Crowe hasn't performed this well in any film recently. He is at the top of his game playing Nash, with fantastic awkwardness, an extremely believable accent, and character traits which seem very well studied. At first glance, he seems to be playing an intelligent Rain Man\/Forrest Gump, but there's so much more depth to his performance.

Well, what we would have in this movie, and to be honest with you, if you gave everybody in Big Brother guns and turned the house into a shooting gallery, I would still not watch it, and not because I don't like violence, but because I find these shows really boring.In fact, I found this movie really boring. There was simply way too much D&M (deep and meaningfuls) in this film to keep me at all interested, and the fact that these characters were all fictional, sort of, not actually did, make the D&Ms all that more pointless and painful to sit through. In a way the violent scenes are few and far between, and even then that stupid voice over makes it even worse.Okay, yes, I understand that the whole idea of this film was to speculate on where society was heading with its craze for reality-TV, and it is not like society has not been there before. Ancient Rome was famous for its blood sports, and the gladiatorial arena did not have foul conduct rules. Basically you were given a sword and told to kill the other gladiator, or, if the audience simply wanted blood, throwing some unarmed prisoner into a pit full of wild animals and see who won.Actually, public executions have been a form of entertainment for quite a while, and in many cases still are.

People typically imagine Chance, Shadow and Sassy from Homeward Bound The Incredible Journey. There is, however, another film in which a farm cat and a pug embark on a journey all their own. The Adventures of Milo and Otis (1986) is a heartwarming story of a pug, Otis, who sets out to find his lost cat friend, Milo.Before examining this film in further detail I will acknowledge the controversy behind this movie. The living animals used in this film were put through some extremely dangerous situations. Any time the director sends a cat over a waterfall in a wooden box it is sure to get some animal cruelty charges. Despite what I may believe about whether or not there was animal abuse on the set of this movie, I still rate this film as I would any other film.Only one actor was used in the film (not including animals). Dudley Moore did the voice over work including narration and character voices. Exquisite voice work keeps the film moving smoothly. Each character had a distinct voice, and the inflection in the voice made the narration interesting. With limited amount of voices the music is an imperative addition to keep the audiences attention. The music fits the tone of the story although at times it does become repetitive. The cinematography is done well. The camera angles and pans allow the story to flow smoothly and effortlessly. A smart script offers genuine emotion with drama and comedy mixed flawlessly.Despite repetitive music and the thought of animal abuse, the movie is very well edited and put together. The entertainment value for children is very high. The playful feel of the movie will hold the attention of the entire family.

It may not be the caliber of Goodfellas and Raging Bull but it is still a powerful and moving film. In the movie we follow paramedic Frank (Nicolas Cage) over three nights as he begins to unravel from stress and starts seeing ghosts and visions of people he has not been able to save. The film is a dark and intense character study with Cage turning in one of his best performances. Scorsese continues to show why he is one of the greatest directors by establishing an evocative tone and creating unforgettable scenes. This may not be a frenetic as some of his other films, but it is still a visual treat in every way. This is not a happy film but, thanks to a brilliant screenplay by Paul Schrader, it is a profound and moving meditation on death and how it affects us. Bringing Out the Dead is a truly great film full of sorrow, morbid humor, and intensity and deserves to be considered among Scorsese's best.

Unfortunately, I don't think I ever did play the game, at least not outside of an arcade version. Certainly not on Playstation or Sega or Nintendo. Yes, I am that old.Anyway, I love these movies. There is not any one part of any of these movies I don't like. If I could watch them all the time I would. Not because of the walking dead, but because Milla Yovovich is hot! It doesn't hurt that we see Milla almost nude a couple of times and there is a nipple glimpse; I won't call it a nipple slip, it was there on purpose.Anyway, like I said, there is literally nothing about any of the Resident Evil movies I don't like. However, as has become my custom in my reviews I have to list my all time favorite scenes. There are three I absolutely love.The first is the scene where the group of soldiers along with Alice (Milla Yovovich) and Spence (James Purefoy) attempt to turn off the Red Queen. Four of the soldiers enter a corridor which leads to the Red Queen's mainframe; after opening the door to her mainframe, the Red Queen closes the doors at both ends and traps the four soldiers. The Red Queen activates her defenses, in the form of lasers; first one that travels along one line, then one that moves up and down depending on if the soldier jumps or crouches, and finally a laser that turns into a grid and slices through the last soldier.I like a lot of the scenes where Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) is the macho soldier. At one point she tells another character to blow her, hilarious. Several scenes into the movie after being bit, Rain is taunting the zombies by dripping blood from a wound in her hand down from pipes the group (Alice, Rain, Spence, Matt and Kaplan) is crawling along.The second scene I like is when the remaining members of the group, minus Kaplan, figure our that Spence is the one who released the T- Virus. Alice attempts to stop Spence's escape but he does so anyway, after a long speech how he did everything for Alice. In the end Alice doesn't buy anything that Spence says and he leaves. But Spence doesn't get far. He is soon killed by a Licker, a mutated monster that is hunting the survivors.The final scene I like is when the Licker attacks the train as the survivors are trying to make their way out of the Hive and the Mansion. The Licker claws it's way to the control end of the train, scratching Matt's arm in the process. When it reaches the controls of the train it attacks Kaplan and kills him, then goes after Alice, Matt and Rain. While Alice and Matt are fighting the Licker, Rain finally turns into a zombie. Now Alice and Matt have to fight the Licker and Rain. Alice traps the Licker's tongue with a pipe and stabs it with another pipe trapping it, yelling to Matt to open the doors to the undercarriage. Matt does this by shooting Rain in the forehead forcing her back into the button for the doors. The Licker falls through the door and from the electricity of the third rail catches fire. Alice closes the doors and cuts the tongue of the Licker letting it tumble away from the train.I said it before, and I'll say it again. I love these movies. I give this one 10 stars out of 10.

Director Frank Capra filmed several different endings, and probably chose the best one, but ultimately found them all lacking in some way. I share his view, but even without a satisfying climax, Meet John Doe represents the motion picture industry at its absolute best. Gary Cooper is perfect as Long John Willoughby, a homeless ex-baseball pitcher with a bum arm. Walter Brennan turns in perhaps his greatest role, as The Colonel, a grumpy fellow who calls people Healots and utters the memorable line, I know the world's been shaved by a drunken barber. Barbara Stanwyck, as always, turns in a compelling performance. Capra invariably supplied his movies with a wealth of strong background characters, and Meet John Doe is no exception. Regis Toomey, at one time a leading man in the early talkies, is particularly good as Bert the Soda Jerk. The script sets up one of the most intriguing premises imaginable; reporter Stanwyck, in a bid to save her job and build circulation, invents a character, John Doe, who threatens to jump off the roof of the highest building in town on Christmas Eve, if people don't start being nicer to each other. His column I Protest, becomes so popular that the newspaper has to produce an actual John Doe, and Cooper wins the part. Gradually, the naive, well meaning Cooper begins to believe in what John Doe is saying, and falls in love with Stanwyck, who has been co-opted by powerful forces, led by the dastardly Edward Arnold, playing the evil tycoon Norton. James Gleason is great here, as the drunken editor who tries to warn Cooper that Stanwyck is a phony. He's perfect for Capra's type of movie, so it's a surprise that this is the only one he ever appeared in. The drama in this film is everywhere; Cooper's affection for Stanwyck, whose hard boiled heart begins to melt, the burgeoning populist John Doe political movement, and the uncertain resolution to John Doe's dilemma. As it becomes obvious that people are not going to start treating each other better, the question becomes- will Cooper actually jump on Christmas Eve? Does he still believe in an ideology that Stanwyck created, for dishonest and cynical reasons? Meet John Doe features Capra's typical dark look at humanity, as exemplified by Stanwyck's deviousness, and the ugly mob mentality of the John Doe supporters as they turn on Cooper. However, again as always, Capra turns that pessimistic view into a fairy tale-like optimism, as Stanwyck comes to believe in Cooper and thus her own philosophy, and the mob realizes realizes the error of its ways. In Capra's films, no matter how extensive the corruption appears, justice always triumphs and the little guy always wins. Thus, it was predictable that Capra would choose the happiest ending possible, with Cooper being saved from jumping at the last minute, by an ill Stanwyck and the mob, represented by Toomis's soda jerk and his wife, as Gleason utters the line, There you go, Norton- the people! Try and lick that! I suppose there was really no adequate way to resolve a plot line like this, and Capra did the best he could. Regardless, Meet John Doe is head and shoulders above almost any other film Hollywood has ever produced.

He's perfect for Capra's type of movie, so it's a surprise that this is the only one he ever appeared in. The drama in this film is everywhere; Cooper's affection for Stanwyck, whose hard boiled heart begins to melt, the burgeoning populist John Doe political movement, and the uncertain resolution to John Doe's dilemma. As it becomes obvious that people are not going to start treating each other better, the question becomes- will Cooper actually jump on Christmas Eve? Does he still believe in an ideology that Stanwyck created, for dishonest and cynical reasons? Meet John Doe features Capra's typical dark look at humanity, as exemplified by Stanwyck's deviousness, and the ugly mob mentality of the John Doe supporters as they turn on Cooper. However, again as always, Capra turns that pessimistic view into a fairy tale-like optimism, as Stanwyck comes to believe in Cooper and thus her own philosophy, and the mob realizes realizes the error of its ways. In Capra's films, no matter how extensive the corruption appears, justice always triumphs and the little guy always wins. Thus, it was predictable that Capra would choose the happiest ending possible, with Cooper being saved from jumping at the last minute, by an ill Stanwyck and the mob, represented by Toomis's soda jerk and his wife, as Gleason utters the line, There you go, Norton- the people! Try and lick that! I suppose there was really no adequate way to resolve a plot line like this, and Capra did the best he could. Regardless, Meet John Doe is head and shoulders above almost any other film Hollywood has ever produced.

Yet characters don't imply a specific plot and this might be the area where theater slightly surpasses literature, as an art of 'presence' and 'personalities' mirroring our condition. More than anything, it's a show, an invitation for eyes, for ears, for feelings. And emotions can do without plots.And here we have Fellini draining his talent from the Antic Roman-Greek tragicomedy, Commedia del' Arte, Opera and maybe more than anything, from his Italian roots so devoted to fun and entertainment. More than any other director, Fellini understood the virtue of Cinema as a new form of theater, a show that doesn't rely on plots or screen writing techniques, he shoots first and we ask the question later. And what a show! Fellini will forever be admired and never equaled, thanks to his unique talent to inhabit his films with unforgettable gallery of characters, eccentrics, larger-than-life, decadent, greedy, gluttonous, sensual, ugly, outcasts, colorful faces with anonymous names and universal and timeless appeals. These people feel real because they FEEL. And we're so hypnotized by the images that we forget to care about a plot.My repetition of the word 'plot' is only an anticipation of some rational comments on Fellini's Roma or, Fellini's Roma, I must say. Yes, the film doesn't have a plot, even to those who set their minds for a surrealist tour orchestrated by the ultimate cinematic ringleader, Il Maestro Fellini. Even 8½ chronicled the very process of film-making from the author's boiling mind, even the previous Fellini's Satyricon was a take on a myth that had a story to tell, no matter how disjointed it felt. Even the nostalgic vignettes of Amarcord made a coherent ensemble, but Fellini's Roma has no focus whatsoever.But does it need one when the scope is so large, when Rome is the main protagonist, such a myth of a city that it transcends all the periods, visions and artistic possibilities. The film is constantly inhabited by Rome's aura from Fellini's perspective, hence the title. For Satyricon, it was a legal necessity, to distinguish from two films with the same title, to establish Fellini's independence from the original myth. Roma similarly establishes Fellini's independence. Except that this time, no other vision of Rome could ever compete with Fellini's, and approach the town with the same masterful audacity.Now, why a film about Rome? My guess is that it's one of the few privileged cities whose name evoke fascinating contradictions. Rome is the city of illusions. Not only by chance you have here the church, the government, the cinema. They each produce illusions. This is Gore Vidal speaking in a memorable cameo and it's probably the closest rational conclusion that can come out of this mesmerizing mess. And illusion is the key word, whether it's the illusion of church that ignited the faith of generation of Italians without abjuring them from that lust for life and voluptuous bodies so rooted in the Italian lifestyle, for politics which have plunged post-War Italy into the darkness of fascism and even Cinema doesn't escape criticism.Behind Fellini's eye, Rome oscillates between dazzling magnificence and nightmarish decadence. Fellini appears twice, as a young idealistic man who discovers the town, eats some spaghetti with the population, goes to the music-hall or visits a brothel, and the older real-life Fellini discussing with the new generation of Romans on how to make an accurate portrayal of the city. And it's ironic how nothing changed much between these times, O Tempora! O Mores yet Mussolini's Italy was as noisy, lusty and turbulent as in 1972, and ironically, Roma's self-referential aspect illustrates that both embellishment and derision work on caricatures, the very illusions, Fellini admits in his own filmmaking process.And illusion contributes to the film's most enigmatic moments, a parade of prostitutes tempting their clients, with sensual bodies to better hide the lucid tiredness in their faces, the scene followed by a sort of ecclesiastic fashion contest. Through the intriguing parallel, the iconoclast Maestro doesn't attack church but the myth of virtue that ignores the real sacred Trinity out of the Vatican limits life, love and lust. His fantasy vision works like a missing link between the eternal myth of Roma and reality. When thinking of Roma, we'll either have a vision of the Coliseum, of a fat Italian with huge bosoms serving a large plate of pasta on a summer evening, or maybe a beautiful red-haired and red-dressed woman sensually dancing at the moonlight of a lamppost, perhaps the greatest cinematic allegory of any town.And if the film works without characters, it does as well without a plot because Rome is that sensual woman with a history, a present, a future, and a past. You can't dig a subway tunnel without bumping on archaeological relics hidden in its prolific womb, like a woman who hasn't revealed all her secrets. And one of the most poignant moments, occurs when engineers find Antic frescoes in a tunnel, preserved just as if they were painted the day before, before oxygen destroys them instantly. That's the price you pay when you have a clear glimpse on reality, imagining how Romans were, would have been more salutary for its (or her) own history. And this is the power of imagination, of illusion over reality or any myth of grandeur. No need for a plot when you have such a wonderful protagonist that encapsulate all the values Italians will forever stand for, and who more entitled than Fellini to share with us a part of his vision. And no need for specific characters when you have the Italians. A famous Italian actor, if I recall correctly, said something like In Italy, there are about thirty millions actors, the rest of the population star in movies. This quote could have been the film's tag-line.

They get into a short discussion about a mysterious figure known as Batman, who has allegedly been taking out criminals in Gotham. Batman then appears, and apprehends them. As one of the muggers pleads for his life, Batman states that he won't kill him, but he wants him to tell fellow criminals about him. After the muggers are taken in by the police, a dirty cop heads into the alley to collect his payment from Jack Napier, consigliere of crime boss Carl Grissom. As Napier and the cop talk, the conversation nearly escalates to death, as guns are briefly drawn after the cop tells Napier that he will never rise in the mob due to his mental instability. Napier, also arrogant amongst his other issues, has been sleeping with Grissom's girlfriend, and as revenge he sends Napier to a chemical factory to do some mob work, but Grissom tips off the police about it. On the same night, a fundraiser for Gotham's 200th anniversary event is being held at the manor of local billionaire Bruce Wayne. At his fundraiser Bruce meets Vicki Vale, a photojournalist attracted to Gotham City by the Batman rumors. The two begin a relationship. At Axis Chemicals, the police arrive, and Napier and his cronies scatter until Batman arrives. Napier attempts to shoot Batman, but the bullets are deflected and hit Napier in the face, horribly scarring him. Napier falls back over the railing right over a vat of chemicals, Batman attempts to keep him from falling, but accidentally drops him into the chemicals. Batman flees the scene. The chemicals wash into the harbor, and a white hand reaches out from the water. It turns out Napier has survived the incident, but the chemicals have permanently stained his skin white, his hair green, and his lips bright red, and some seedy plastic surgery also leads to him having a permanent grin. After killing Grissom, Napier takes over the mob and begins to refer to himself as the Joker. Using Axis Chemicals, the Joker taints various household products, poisoning the citizens of Gotham City, and the already existing hatred the Joker has for Batman increases after he thwarts his crimes, and he becomes determined to replace Batman as the freakish center of attention in Gotham City.Batman is refreshingly different from other superhero films, it keeps the title character mysterious, and this suits him perfectly. Michael Keaton's performance is great, he's intimidating, funny, cool, and often doesn't even need to speak to sell such things, his facial expressions do the trick just fine much of the time. On the other side of the spectrum, we have the Joker Loud, attention- craving, and hilarious. It's very interesting to watch how the Joker's personality escalates, beginning as an unstable gangster with aptitudes of art to becoming a homicidal madman who scars women and creates devices more deadly than they appear. The cast is great all around, having a good love interest in Kim Basinger's Vicki Vale along with classic supporting actors like Robert Wuhl, Jack Palance, Tracey Walter, and Michael Gough. Danny Elfman's score is, in a word - incredible. Music is very important to storytelling and vice versa, the two things enhance each other immensely in this film. It suits Batman perfectly, dark yet adventurous. Prince did two songs for the film, Partyman and Trust. They may seem unnecessary or out of place to some people, but I enjoy both songs and their uses, and the scene in which Partyman is used is actually one of my favorite scenes.The production design perfectly represents the non-realism of its characters and its own universe It's fantastic, but not realistic, and it shouldn't be realistic, too many people forget the core concept is a man dressing up as a bat and fighting crime. Gotham City looks like a cross between the Emerald City and Dracula's castle, a vast noir metropolis filled with crime. Jack Napier sums up the city perfectly with his line Decent people shouldn't live here. They'd be happier someplace else, with locations like the smog-riddled Axis Chemicals and the seemingly impossibly tall Gotham Cathedral being the highlight of this dark world, which is complimented by the atmospheric skyline.

My face on the one dollar bill., and Knox's line He must have been King of the Wicker People.There's a sort of reap what you sow theme, with the character's actions in the past heavily affecting the present day story. In his youth, Jack Napier murders Bruce's parents, which causes him to become Batman. Years later, Batman accidentally drops Jack into a vat of chemicals, turning him into the Joker. The two have a great dynamic, encountering each other in various personas at various times and places. Their hatred for each other comes from so many things, which include their desire for revenge against one another, the Joker's advances on Vicki, and Batman stealing the spotlight from the Joker.The Batman series would go through many sequels and reboots of varying degrees of underrated and overrated, but none matched Batman, and most likely, none will. The closest we got, and close it is indeed, is its sequel Batman Returns.

There is a lot of cute dogs here.JLOT is a remake of old movie which used the same story . The huge difference is that old movie was a serious drama while this is a romantic comedy . Or maybe I should say a comedy with some nice love story thrown in.This is kinda forgotten movie from the 80's.Unrightfully . The 80's was a great time for comedies and some good ones might have been overlooked. Don't miss your chance to watch this one. It's a pleasant one to watch. Nothing spectacular , but enjoyable.

It's a bit creaky and stagy at times, but I really liked the film overall. I wouldn't say it has a ton of suspense, but the more psychotic Rhoda gets, it certainly does give the film an eerie type of feel. I also dug the slow burn type of build it had going for it. We know right away that something is not right with Rhoda, and that she's heartless, but it smartly lets us use our imagination for a little bit before fully revealing how demented Rhoda is. Bad Seed is also propelled by a wonderful cast. Patty McCormick is legendary as Rhoda. She is downright creepy at times, and is definitely not a kid I'd want to parent. Her manipulative & evil showcase was awesome to watch. Her chemistry with Nancy Kelly (The Mom) is excellent and often powerful; speaking of Nancy Kelly I felt for the woman in this movie; her character goes through some emotionally draining stages as the Mother who hates what her daughter has become, and I easily empathized with her plight. I adored her. William Hopper is your standard wooden actor from the 50's. His plastic style was a bit of a groaner, but he had his moments. The ending is one that will stick with you for a little while; at least it did for me. It's not necessarily disturbing, but it will make a mark in your mind with how it is done.Final Thoughts I would not recommend this to younger viewers. They will most likely be bored to tears; however. For adults that want an old school psychological study that is ahead of it's time, they will be richly rewarded.

The two detectives on the case, John Travolta and Madeleine Stowe, are honest, persistent and skilled. The story deserves a 7.5, but the telling of it doesn't match.There are two related crimes. The one under investigation is a murder by strangulation of a female captain, played by Leslie Stefanson. This looks like a rape but isn't. Travolta and Stowe eventually connect it to an earlier rape that was covered up at West Point.It's quite a good mystery. Experienced mystery viewers will have a fairly good idea of who the murderer might be but won't be sure, and all viewers will find a number of other surprises scattered through the film.James Woods takes acting honors as the superior of Stefanson. In general the whole cast is capable. His part is very well written. John Travolta's skills were evident from early on in Saturday Night Fever. He has matured, but I think he's the kind of actor who needs good writing and directing in order really to create a character and make that character stand out.The script here is not deep enough for many of the characters, including his. The story is dealing with deep personal corruption and the screenplay's surface characterizations, while matching this, do not go deep enough to hit us hard emotionally and viscerally. I didn't really believe in a number of the characters as real people. I felt they were more concocted in order to fulfill the story's requirements.The film makers infuse the picture with a dark look and atmosphere, often using color filters. This befits its neo-noir themes. The main problem with the film is in the limited capacity of its script and direction to bring the people to life. Actors can only go so far in compensating for script deficiencies. Another serious negative is the music, in my opinion. In a number of places, the film overdoes things, attempting to make large impressions either visually or musically or both. This comes off more clumsy and bombastic than anything else.The negative treatment given to the army is good, because the army has a great many problems. The film does a very good job of contrasting the army's appearances, rituals and uniforms with the corruption and problems under the surface. Even when it shows what seems to be a sincere respect and patriotism for the army, it is also making it look fairly ridiculous.The picture has a theme of the place of women in the military, but it's not explored deeply apart from the rape. The rape is suggesting there are unanswered problems here, but the overall treatment of this issue is perfunctory and ambiguous. For example, the postscript lauds the 200,000 females in the armed forces. I think that in order to get the film made, its makers needed some cooperation of the US Army, so that they inserted this at the end.What we have here is a bold story, a good story, some attractive acting, a reasonably good production design, but these are not supported by a script and direction that bring the characters to life realistically enough.
