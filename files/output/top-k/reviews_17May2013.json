[{"date":"17 May 2013","score":"","review":" A great example of how movie can be interesting and can involve you and leave you thinking without any special effects, without great script or plot... Lets face it, this movies doesn't have great script, it doesn't have great plot either. Movie plot is interesting and definitely can involve you, yet it is not a breathtaking story with many twists and turns. But there is one thing that makes this movie great, and it is acting. Because of acting this movie is breathtaking an involving and represents one great experience and one hell of a ride.Each character is important, each character is there for a reason and can't be left out. The way Matt Damon carried out his role made me speechless, his acting is superb, at times you can relate to him and feel sorry for poor underachiever Tom Ripley, but then, just moment later he gives you chills and scares you as hell. He's a beauty and a beast in one. And it's not only because of his role, in fact it's mostly because of the way he carried out his role. Jude Law gave the performance without a flaw. Moreover his acting is perfect. He embodied young playboy and adventurer so good that we all could feel what is like to be Dickie Greenleaf even for a moment, singing and drinking in jazz club in Naples or sun tanning and picking up girls on the sand beaches of Mongibello. Other actors were superb too, maybe only Gwyneth Paltrow had some, not bad, but less good moments in movie, but all in all it is a flawless acting.To sum up all characters were played by perfect actors for that role, and when that happens movie can't be bad, indeed, it will probably be as great as this one.There aren't many movies which made me relate to every one of the main characters, good or bad, and for that I give this movie 8 out of 10. To be a 9 or a perfect 10 any movie should have something in addition to perfect acting, such things as extraordinary special effects, mind blowing twists or exceptional plot. In lack of those i give Talented Mr. Ripley a perfect 8.

Filled with great, atmospheric direction,wonderful acting and a great score Blood Simple is The Coen Brothers at their best.Set in Texas,Blood Simple tells the story of bar owner Julian Marty(Dan Hedaya)who suspects that his wife Abby(Frances McDormand)is having an affair with Ray(John Getz)one of Marty's bartenders. Angry about the affair,Marty hires sleazy private detective Loren Visser(M. Emmett Walsh)to kill Abby and Ray. But Abby,Ray,Marty and Visser discover that when Blood flows nothing is simple or straight forward but Blood Simple.Released in 1985,Blood Simple was the classic debut from master filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen AKA The Coen Brothers and was the first of many masterpieces and classics from The Coen Brothers and is one of the best film debuts of all time. One of the reasons Blood Simple is a great film and a classic is because The Coen Brothers took the Film Noir genre with Blood Simple and uses the influence of Film Noir and Mystery icons such as Dashell Hammett,Raymond Chandler and James M. Cain and created an original and stylish film that grabs you by the throat right from the opening credits all the way to the end. Like any great Film Noir Blood Simple gives viewers a dark world with amoral characters and where nothing is for certain and nothing is what it seems where you're not sure who's a good or who's bad and the things that happen to the characters are unpredictable and unexpected. Blood Simple is the beginning and start of many films that The Coen Brothers deal with Film Noir and The Coens know the Film Noir genre like the back of their hands and it truly shows in this film. Blood Simple is a film that is filled with Suspense and dread where you don't what's going to happen or when and you as the viewer are on edge because of the twists and turns that happen in the film that will make you wonder what's going on and why. Blood Simple sometimes has the feel of a Horror film because of the way people are getting killed and blood being all over the place and the sense of darkness and fear that hangs over the film where the characters and the viewers are put into a paranoid state of mind and you have to look over both shoulders. What I also love about the film is the dark and twisted sense of humor the film has because there are some moments in the film that are balanced between being serious and funny and absurd as well as offbeat and over the top where anything and everything can happen in a morbid and insane fashion which is something that has happened in many of The Coen Brothers films. The photography by Barry Sonnenfield is beautiful and dark and makes Texas look like a haunting nightmare and a isolated land that makes the characters feel alone. The screenplay by The Coen Brothers is amazing with Coens giving the characters memorable and funny dialog and giving the film and the characters many great moments. The main characters in the film are not always likable but are memorable and strike a perfect balance between good and evil with Ray and Abby they feel they're doing good despite their actions where as Marty and Private Detective Visser are pure evil with no likable or redeemable qualities. That being there are no good guys and bad guys just characters with moral ambiguity. The violence in the film is brutal,bloody and uncompromising and when the violence happens it is fast and unexpected and when you at the screen the violence will shock you and disturb you. The final 12-15 minutes of this film are masterful and is filled with great suspense and terror. It's a great conclusion that you won't forget and is one of the Coen Brothers best endings.The cast does great jobs in their roles. John Getz is great and effective as Ray,Abby's boyfriend,Getz bringing depth and believability to the role. Frances McDormand is wonderful and memorable as Abby,with McDormand making Abby likable and sympathetic. Great character actor Dan Hedaya is amazing as the Julian Marty,Abby's unstable husband. Another great character actor M. Emmett Walsh is brilliant as private detective Loren Visser,who in my opinion is one of the best villains in film history. Walsh is menacing,unforgettable and funny in the role. Samm-Art Williams is fantastic and funny in his role as Maurice,one of Marty's bartenders. Also,lookout for an uncredited voice cameo from Holly Hunter.The direction by The Coen Brothers is excellent,with the Coens always moving the camera and great angles and shots giving the film a dark atmosphere. Great direction by The Coens.The score by Carter Burwell is is wonderful,dark and effective and fits with the films dark tone. A powerful score by Burwell. I also loved the use of the classic tune The Same Old Song by The Four Tops.In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Film Noir,Mystery-Thrillers or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see Blood Simple,a brilliant,unforgettable classic from The Coen Brothers that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"17 May 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Blood Simple is one of the best Film Noir\/Mystery\/Thrillers ever made and a excellent debut from The Coen Brothers.

I had avoided it because I was under the incorrect impression, as so many people are, that this was a plot less and needlessly gory B movie. Although I have no issue with gory movies, I do prefer that they have a story.Amusingly enough, I saw this movie on a first date. That evening consisted of Tank Girl, Day of the Dead, and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. I liked the guy enough that I was willing to watch his movie, even though I was adamant I wouldn't like it. I am glad I did watch it, because I had been denying myself the viewing of an absolutely brilliant horror film.There are definitely misconceptions surrounding this movie. Like Psycho and other horror films, parts of this movie are taken from the life of Ed Gein. However, these parts are small and mostly insignificant. The scene in the house will all the bones lying around is really the only thing that comes from this story. Gein was also not a serial killer, as he only murdered two people and was more notorious as a grave robber. And he definitely never cut people up with chain saws.One of the things that shocked me was the lack of blood and gore in this movie. It did, however, have something in common with Psycho. The camera work definitely gives the impression of gore and it is easy to walk away from this movie assuming that there was a lot more blood and guts than there actually was. The horror comes from so many places that actual gore is not necessary. The victims are less expectant than most horror victims and that in itself is disturbing. But Sally's approximately 20 minutes straight horror and scream fest are more unsettling than any amount of blood and violence could ever be. It takes you deeply into the horror she went through and by the time she is in the back of that pickup truck, yelling at Leatherface, you know you have felt it. The silent way the movie ends is reflective of what you must be feeling if this is the first time you have ever seen this movie.If you have avoided seeing this movie for any reason but like horror, watch it. Two movies defined 1970's horror The Exorcist and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. There is little gore in this movie, because it will hit you on a psychological level that no amount of blood and guts can equal. An absolutely amazing and brilliant movie and well worth you time.

I had avoided it because I was under the incorrect impression, as so many people are, that this was a plot less and needlessly gory B movie. Although I have no issue with gory movies, I do prefer that they have a story.Amusingly enough, I saw this movie on a first date. That evening consisted of Tank Girl, Day of the Dead, and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. I liked the guy enough that I was willing to watch his movie, even though I was adamant I wouldn't like it. I am glad I did watch it, because I had been denying myself the viewing of an absolutely brilliant horror film.There are definitely misconceptions surrounding this movie. Like Psycho and other horror films, parts of this movie are taken from the life of Ed Gein. However, these parts are small and mostly insignificant. The scene in the house will all the bones lying around is really the only thing that comes from this story. Gein was also not a serial killer, as he only murdered two people and was more notorious as a grave robber. And he definitely never cut people up with chain saws.One of the things that shocked me was the lack of blood and gore in this movie. It did, however, have something in common with Psycho. The camera work definitely gives the impression of gore and it is easy to walk away from this movie assuming that there was a lot more blood and guts than there actually was. The horror comes from so many places that actual gore is not necessary. The victims are less expectant than most horror victims and that in itself is disturbing. But Sally's approximately 20 minutes straight horror and scream fest are more unsettling than any amount of blood and violence could ever be. It takes you deeply into the horror she went through and by the time she is in the back of that pickup truck, yelling at Leatherface, you know you have felt it. The silent way the movie ends is reflective of what you must be feeling if this is the first time you have ever seen this movie.If you have avoided seeing this movie for any reason but like horror, watch it. Two movies defined 1970's horror The Exorcist and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. There is little gore in this movie, because it will hit you on a psychological level that no amount of blood and guts can equal. An absolutely amazing and brilliant movie and well worth you time.

While I still have no sympathy for anyone or anything in the movie, I think the movie is nevertheless a lot more coherent than I initially thought, and for this - and also for the excellent filmography - I am giving it an 8\/10. (1)A friend of mine suggested this movie is about the various possibilities of existence which cannot be realized simultaneously in real life. I felt this wasn't right but I didn't have another interpretation to offer. But now I do. Let's see what Weronika and Veronique are all about(a) SimilaritiesThey are both sickly creatures. They have a father, they don't have a mother. They are both engaged with music. They know and interact with a series of characters of no consequence (the aunt, the colleague from school, etc.) They both appear in a love relationship where their lovers are more involved than themselves. They both dismiss those lovers. They both have a plastic (?) ball and are fascinated by what the world looks like as reflected through it. They both watch an old woman through the window. They both seem to drift without touching the world around them. They both see their doppelgänger.(b) DifferencesWeronika lives in Poland. She is not independent (lives with her dad \/ aunt). She seems young and inexperienced. She moves to another city for the sake of her aunt. Feels that she is not alone in the world. She dies singing.Veronique lives in France. She is financially independent (she lives on her own, has her own job). She seems more mature, and already anchored in music (she has a music teacher, she teaches music). She quits her music lessons although her teacher thinks she has a great talent. She feels alone in the world. She falls in love (Weronika never seems in love; talking to her aunt, she seems excited to have slept with that guy but abandons him). She accepts the game played on her by the anonymous stalker. She becomes acquainted with her puppeteer. She sees her doppelgänger, in the end. She begins to see how he may be the one manipulating her. Veronique's story begins as Weronika dies. This chronological details is supported by the photo \/ negative from Poland, which is the moment when the stories of the two girls become anchored in reality and aligned in a particular chronological order.So far, what does this movie seem to be about? Let's say that Veronique's first apparition and inexplicable grief is a premonition of what might happen to her if she continues taking music lessons \/ trying to make a career in music. This premonition leads her to abandon her existential possibility of realizing her potential through music. Having abandoned this possibility (I don't feel like it should be called her 'ideal' - Veronique doesn't really seem to have a passion, a dream, an ideal!), she somehow loses her path. Is she the ballerina who breaks her leg and then turns into a butterfly, as the ballerina in the puppeteer's story? This seems rather to be Weronika's story. Veronique refuses to break her leg, so there's no question of her turning into a butterfly. Is, then, the movie about a character with a talent for music to whom her talent is fatal, and for whom abandoning the talent would lead to perdition all the same? If yes, then the movie does make sense, although I'm still not sure about the puppeteer. It's as if the puppeteer had somehow condemned both these girls to death, and loves them when they have accepted their sentence. (Antek too could be some kind of a puppeteer he tells Weronika he loves her only after she had come to the city and was already pursuing her talent! Likewise, Alexandre too tells Veronique he loves her only after she had accepted to enter the game of the anonymous caller.)If this death sentence were the true meaning of the movie, then it also would be easier to understand why Veronique has two lovers (the first, unnamed one, and then, Alexandre), and Weronika only one Veronique quits music and drives away her first lover, and this could be a rejection of dying for her talent. Her condemnation to death is, however, still there having failed to kill her through music, the puppeteer steps in himself.The weird thing about this interpretation is that, although both girls do seem to have some relation to music, neither of them gives the impression that music is the biggest thing in their lives. Music is just something they happen to be good at, good enough to be remarked and regretted when they cannot \/ refuse to pursue it. For the rest, these girls look like lambs brought to the slaughterhouse. For example, when Weronika's aunt asks her how her audition had gone, Weronika answers something like (I don't remember the exact wording) it went TOO well. Apathetic...(2) My conclusion about the movieAfter lots of thinking, here's, then, my conclusion regarding what this movie is about I think it is about condemnation to death, regardless of other life details. This idea seems supported by that episode where Veronique holds the shoestring across the graph paper in a straight line over her recent EKG graph. The straight line of an EKG = death.Everything else in the movie is ballast. The doppelgänger thing is rather a red herring it muddles the waters without any pay-off, really.Now I understand why the music is throughout so sad \/ sinister. Also, why there is so much ballast, so many gestures of no consequence. So many attempts at a plot but with no actual realization. The characters are doomed, and that's all.

Ebert said that Raging Bull was a great movie. People would protest that they didn't want to see it because they didn't want to see a film about boxers. No, Ebert insisted. The subject matter of a film is not the heart of the film. Rather, it's how well a film is made that matters. An expertly made film about boxers is better than a badly made film about a topic you may be interested in. So, no, I'm not a man; I'm not divorced. But The Odd Couple was so well made that I fell in love with it. I surprised myself by laughing out loud throughout the film. The Odd Couple, of course, is the story of news writer Felix Unger leaving his wife and children and moving in with his friend, sports writer Oscar Madison, who is himself a divorcée. Oscar lives in an eight-room Manhattan apartment, which he used to share with his wife and their kids. Felix is neat; Oscar is messy. Sounds pretty trite.But the movie is a revelation. The script reveals surprising depth about love, hate, and human relationships. The Walter-Matthau-Jack-Lemmon team is like a well-oiled machine &#x96; they seem to have perfected their shtick together through several lifetimes. Jack Lemmon plays the entire movie completely straight. He gives the exact same kind of performance as he did when he was acting in The Days of Wine and Roses, a hyper serious film about alcoholism. When Lemmon, as Felix, is upset about his meatloaf burning, he shows as much agony as he showed in the previous film about a drunk ruining his own life. It's hysterically funny to watch this poor schmuck wrestle with his petty obsessions and compulsions, oblivious to how he affects others. Even as you laugh at him, you realize he can't help himself. Felix Unger has Asperger's. What has changed in America, and American film, that this film from 1968 feels like a time capsule from a lost moment in America? Oscar lives in a spacious, eight-room Manhattan apartment. Manhattan real estate has become more expensive, of course. But it's more than that. The words that kept going through my head as I was watching the movie were grown-up and intelligent. Oscar, Felix, and their poker buddies are six white guys. They meet and play poker. There are no scenes where these adult, white men are revealed to be inept in comparison to women, blacks, or homosexuals. There are no scenes where the sassy gay man instructs the straight men on how to dress or create romance. There are no scenes where the magical negro shows the men that they can't dance. There are no scenes where a woman puts the men down for not knowing how to take care of children or shows the men up as being blinded by lust. There are no scenes where these straight, white men are made to apologize for being straight, white men. The men are grownups. They have jobs. They wear adult clothing. They wear white shirts and ties, slacks, belts, and shiny shoes. Oscar does wear a backwards baseball cap, but he is the clown of the group. And he does not wear it throughout the film. When he goes out, he dresses properly. They speak of their marriages as if marriage were something important. They speak of their children as if they love them. They go on dates. They ask women out, dress up for the occasion, and make witty banter with subtle double entendres. While watching The Odd Couple, I thought of recent Judd Apatow comedies starring men like Jason Segel, Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill. These current male stars all play children; they all play losers. They play failed men. The humor in these films is built around what pathetic creatures they are. In Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Jason Segel, who is fat and prematurely saggy, is shown fully naked. The nakedness highlights his humiliation when his girlfriend, Sarah Marshall, dumps him. These films all use the F word over and over in a manner that feels desperate and limited. There is one very sly, very funny reference to the f word in The Odd Couple. Oscar complains to Felix Unger that he is tired of getting little notes from Felix like We are all out of cornflakes. Signed, FU. Oscar says it took him hours to figure out what FU meant. A funny joke. Delivered deliciously. The only time The Odd Couple has to refer to the F word to get a laugh. I've never felt, while watching a Judd Apatow comedy, that I was gaining any insight into the human condition. There are so many payoff moments of absurd comedy in The Odd Couple, as when Oscar steps on a vacuum cleaner cord and then takes his foot off the cord at just the right moment to send Felix reeling. But there were so many moments that made me say, Gosh, yes, that's what human relationships are like. That's what it's like to love\/hate another human being.I can't imagine a film like The Odd Couple being made today. A genuinely funny, intelligent, rich, grownup comedy about men that shines light on the human condition and that need never speak the F word to get a laugh. And I can't imagine anyone other than a Trump being able to afford that eight-room apartment in Manhattan.

They ask women out, dress up for the occasion, and make witty banter with subtle double entendres. While watching The Odd Couple, I thought of recent Judd Apatow comedies starring men like Jason Segel, Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill. These current male stars all play children; they all play losers. They play failed men. The humor in these films is built around what pathetic creatures they are. In Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Jason Segel, who is fat and prematurely saggy, is shown fully naked. The nakedness highlights his humiliation when his girlfriend, Sarah Marshall, dumps him. These films all use the F word over and over in a manner that feels desperate and limited. There is one very sly, very funny reference to the f word in The Odd Couple. Oscar complains to Felix Unger that he is tired of getting little notes from Felix like We are all out of cornflakes. Signed, FU. Oscar says it took him hours to figure out what FU meant. A funny joke. Delivered deliciously. The only time The Odd Couple has to refer to the F word to get a laugh. I've never felt, while watching a Judd Apatow comedy, that I was gaining any insight into the human condition. There are so many payoff moments of absurd comedy in The Odd Couple, as when Oscar steps on a vacuum cleaner cord and then takes his foot off the cord at just the right moment to send Felix reeling. But there were so many moments that made me say, Gosh, yes, that's what human relationships are like. That's what it's like to love\/hate another human being.I can't imagine a film like The Odd Couple being made today. A genuinely funny, intelligent, rich, grownup comedy about men that shines light on the human condition and that need never speak the F word to get a laugh.

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"17 May 2013","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I remember something that Roger Ebert said in an interview with Martin Scorcese. Ebert said that Raging Bull was a great movie. People would protest that they didn't want to see it because they didn't want to see a film about boxers. No, Ebert insisted. The subject matter of a film is not the heart of the film. Rather, it's how well a film is made that matters. An expertly made film about boxers is better than a badly made film about a topic you may be interested in. So, no, I'm not a man; I'm not divorced. But The Odd Couple was so well made that I fell in love with it. I surprised myself by laughing out loud throughout the film. The Odd Couple, of course, is the story of news writer Felix Unger leaving his wife and children and moving in with his friend, sports writer Oscar Madison, who is himself a divorcée. Oscar lives in an eight-room Manhattan apartment, which he used to share with his wife and their kids. Felix is neat; Oscar is messy. Sounds pretty trite.But the movie is a revelation. The script reveals surprising depth about love, hate, and human relationships. The Walter-Matthau-Jack-Lemmon team is like a well-oiled machine &#x96; they seem to have perfected their shtick together through several lifetimes. Jack Lemmon plays the entire movie completely straight. He gives the exact same kind of performance as he did when he was acting in The Days of Wine and Roses, a hyper serious film about alcoholism. When Lemmon, as Felix, is upset about his meatloaf burning, he shows as much agony as he showed in the previous film about a drunk ruining his own life. It's hysterically funny to watch this poor schmuck wrestle with his petty obsessions and compulsions, oblivious to how he affects others. Even as you laugh at him, you realize he can't help himself. Felix Unger has Asperger's. What has changed in America, and American film, that this film from 1968 feels like a time capsule from a lost moment in America? Oscar lives in a spacious, eight-room Manhattan apartment. Manhattan real estate has become more expensive, of course. But it's more than that. The words that kept going through my head as I was watching the movie were grown-up and intelligent. Oscar, Felix, and their poker buddies are six white guys. They meet and play poker. There are no scenes where these adult, white men are revealed to be inept in comparison to women, blacks, or homosexuals. There are no scenes where the sassy gay man instructs the straight men on how to dress or create romance. There are no scenes where the magical negro shows the men that they can't dance. There are no scenes where a woman puts the men down for not knowing how to take care of children or shows the men up as being blinded by lust.

He and a handful of colleagues, all strangers to one another, pull off a major bank heist and make off with more than two million dollars. To recover the money, a beautiful and unorthodox insurance investigator, Faye Dunaway, is brought into the case. They fall in love, or apparently fall in love, and McQueen claims he will give the money back, since he already has all he wants.I realized by the end that some important plot points had escaped me. How come McQueen winds up with ALL the loot? Does Dunaway try to outfox him and send him to jail? And where is McQueen headed in that airliner? Does he leave Dunaway with nothing but a free Mercedes? It was directed by Norman Jewison and released in 1968, a good year for movies generally. It's stylish, yes, but the style is of the period and looks a little odd from our current perspective, like watching a 1942 musical featuring Tommy Dorsey and his band, and a lot of men in uniform jitterbugging with the bobby soxers.It isn't until Dunaway's close ups that you understand the impasto of eye make up in the late 60s. And her black eyelashes are the size of window awnings on an ordinary house. They must flap in a stiff wind. The clothes are tres chic. That's not necessarily bad. Dunaway has nice knees, but otherwise, what with hats the shape of flying saucers, she seems a sterile, odorless presence on the screen. McQueen only looks slightly uncomfortable in his three-piece suits, smoking those thin cigars or demonstrating his recklessness on a golf course.The prolonged scene of their playing chess at McQueens manse has been described as extremely sexy, a kind of foreplay or at least thirdplay, and I can see why. That's clearly what the director was aiming at. But if you're not particularly turned on by either Dunaway's or McQueen, or their characters, it turns into an extended chess match, and that's all.The musical score is of the period too. Very sophisticated in a jazzy and romantic way with Burt Bacharach vocals like ba-ba-dee ba-ba-dumb of the sort that were popular at the time. They are even more pronounced in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The score isn't at all objectionable. I kind of like it. But the faddish split-screens, ripped off from Andy Warhol's Chelsea Girls and infecting the screen for the next couple of years, is a distraction and a major nuisance.It's not a terrible movie. Some of the supporting players are quite good and the viewer gets a nice tour of Boston and environs. And it must have been successful because they recently remade it, just as Hollywood now remakes every movie that ever made a nickel.

It's been spoofed, referenced, praised, and paid homage countless times. Seriously, I'm pretty sure just about every television series that's existed since the 1960s had made some reference to GOLDFINGER in some form. No matter what your opinion of the movie, no matter where your 007 tastes run, you absolutely have to respect the third James Bond adventure for what it was the first 007 movie with all of the familiar tropes that will continue through the series until the 2006 reboot. GOLDFINGER marks the first time we see Bond visiting Q in his lab to receive gadgets, not just a briefcase with hidden compartments and a Walther. We're talking real 007 gadgets. Case in point Bond's Aston Martin DB5, one of the most iconic movie vehicles in cinema. We have our first memorably over-the-top villain with fantastical plans that go above and beyond your average criminal. And then, to top it all off, we have the first official Bond movie theme. Sure, DR. NO had Monty Norman & John Barry's actual 007 theme music but I'm talking about a special song written purely for the opening sequence of the picture in question. Shirley Bassey's GOLDFINGER established a standard for all 007 movies that followed. Regardless of my opinion, this movie set the (no pun intended) gold standard for the franchise and helped it morph into what it is today. For that, GOLDFINGER should earn any Bond fan's respect and establishes it in my top favorite 007 films.So what do I actually feel about the picture? Well, I'm sure I've mentioned in my comments on some of the other Bond films that I was introduced to the franchise late in the game. The first 007 movie I saw was GOLDENEYE, and from there I transitioned into the Roger Moore era and didn't actually experience the original Connery films until later. So my Bond tastes tend to run with some of the more bizarre films with insane action set pieces and quirky villains, but that doesn't mean I don't enjoy the earlier films as well. The first few 007 movies were pretty tame in comparison very grounded villains, basic action, a more suspenseful tone. In my opinion, GOLDFINGER (despite the gadget-laden DB5 and Oddjob's novel nature) still falls into this category. It's a slower paced film and, being the mid-60s, still contains some of the clichés of the era. That's OK to me. I can dig that. GOLDFINGER is not a movie that will get me pumped and have me eagerly awaiting the next exciting moment; it just sort of cruises along at it's own speed. To be honest, when I first saw this movie at a younger age, I wasn't impressed. It was too drawn out for me to get into it. It took a few more years and a few more viewings to start appreciating it and all of its elements. It gives me the impression that the newer generation of Bond fans, accustomed to the fast-paced action of the Daniel Craig era, might have a harder time appreciating GOLDFINGER (and a lot of the Connery films).As a villain, Auric Goldfinger (Gert Fröbe) is one of the best. He's charismatic, charming, and a little bit insane. He's the first 007 villain with a major quirk defining him, in this case his obsession with gold. Goldfinger is fantastic, and I love that he perfectly sums up the role of the Bond villain for every movie to follow in a single line of dialogue. In the scene of the film where Goldfinger is addressing a room full of his criminal colleagues about his plans for Operation Grand Slam Man has climbed Mount Everest, gone to the bottom of the ocean. He's fired rockets at the moon, split the atom, achieved miracles in every field of human endeavor&#x85;except crime. And so nearly every Bond villain that followed rose above common crime with mastermind aspirations, whether it be hijacking space capsules, obliterating the world's economy with bio-weapons, or flooding silicon valley to corner the microchip market. Of course, he wouldn't be a top Bond villain without a quality henchman. Oddjob (former wrestler Harold Sakata) is a great baddie for Bond to face a silent killer with a razor-rimmed derby hat and an unquestioning loyalty to his boss. GOLDFINGER's Bond girl is Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore. She's one of the few Bond women who's tough enough on her own to hold her own in a fight or resist Bond's charms. She's tough, talented, and beautiful.With Sean Connery at his best, GOLDFINGER stands out as one of the best Bond films and has, for the most part, withstood the test of time. I hope new generations of fans, introduced through the Daniel Craig films and whatever comes after, will go back and check out movies such as GOLDFINGER to see where it all began.

It tells a story of a young couple called Kit and Holly who are on the run from the law in the wide expanses of the American mid-west. It begins with the boy shooting the girl's father and then escalates into more and more murders. Martin Sheen is very good as Kit. He is a character who evidently seems to be a psychopath, yet for most of the time he is extremely laid-back and gentle-natured. This makes his underplayed acts of spontaneous violence all the more jarring. Sissy Spacek is Holly, the naive young girl who falls under his spell; she projects just the right amount of innocence mixed with underlying morbidity. Her father, played by cult favourite Warren Oates, is similarly a complex character; while on the one hand he is entirely unreasonable when he shoots his daughter's dog as a punishment for her hanging around with Kit, on the other hand it would seem that his initial insistence that she stay away from the boy was ultimately clearly the correct advice. All of the actors put in naturalistic performances and this adds to the realism. The pacing and tone of the film overall really makes you feel the mundane slowness of the sun-baked environment it is set.The narrative is propelled not so much by action but by voice-over. The excerpts are taken from Holly's diary. This, coupled with the attractive cinematography, gives Badlands a very lyrical feel. The story itself really is somewhat limited and it doesn't, in truth, always engage. The characters are so distant that this is perhaps inevitable. There is a very non-judgemental view of their actions. It's really left to the viewer to decide what they think of what they see, and this isn't such a bad thing. It resembles Bonnie and Clyde in a lot of ways, a movie that was clearly an inspiration. While going forward, it's distinctive and delicate percussion-only music was used in the later True Romance. Showing that this is a road movie that continues to influence.

It begins with the boy shooting the girl's father and then escalates into more and more murders. Martin Sheen is very good as Kit. He is a character who evidently seems to be a psychopath, yet for most of the time he is extremely laid-back and gentle-natured. This makes his underplayed acts of spontaneous violence all the more jarring. Sissy Spacek is Holly, the naive young girl who falls under his spell; she projects just the right amount of innocence mixed with underlying morbidity. Her father, played by cult favourite Warren Oates, is similarly a complex character; while on the one hand he is entirely unreasonable when he shoots his daughter's dog as a punishment for her hanging around with Kit, on the other hand it would seem that his initial insistence that she stay away from the boy was ultimately clearly the correct advice. All of the actors put in naturalistic performances and this adds to the realism. The pacing and tone of the film overall really makes you feel the mundane slowness of the sun-baked environment it is set.The narrative is propelled not so much by action but by voice-over. The excerpts are taken from Holly's diary. This, coupled with the attractive cinematography, gives Badlands a very lyrical feel. The story itself really is somewhat limited and it doesn't, in truth, always engage. The characters are so distant that this is perhaps inevitable. There is a very non-judgemental view of their actions. It's really left to the viewer to decide what they think of what they see, and this isn't such a bad thing. It resembles Bonnie and Clyde in a lot of ways, a movie that was clearly an inspiration. While going forward, it's distinctive and delicate percussion-only music was used in the later True Romance. Showing that this is a road movie that continues to influence.

Another reason was, that the actress who played Scout (I don't care what her real name is, just read) was annoying, really really annoying.

In many ways, it is a movie about accepting responsibility and going the extra mile to do the right thing. Whether it's Picard refusing to abandon ship, or Data struggling to reject becoming a human (something he's always wanted), or Cochrane struggling to muster up the balls to test his FTL ship. Does it help to be a Star Trek fan? No, not really. It's not like they blindly reference old episodes from the show without any explanation - everything that happens is explained and easy to understand. Still, unlike JJ Abrams, this movie isn't dumbed down to encourage non-fans to give it a shot.I was surprised to find myself emotionally invested in the ending, especially after only tuning in over half-way through and having to explain several plot points to my wife (amazingly, I remembered MUCH more than I thought). And here's the crazy part, folks you know how you can be flipping through the channels, come across a show or movie you haven't seen in a long time, it keeps your interest until the first commercial break, and then you change the channel? That didn't happen. My wife and I watched the whole damn thing - it kept our attention the entire time. And when a movie can do that, you know it's worth watching.I highly recommend this movie.

I've seen it three more times since then and here's what strikes me For one, although Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry is undeniably great, practically every primary aspect of Trek is present in Forbidden Planet, which was released almost a decade before the first Star Trek pilot episode was produced (!). You name it warp drive, Captain\/First Officer\/Doctor triumvirate, babe in ultra-sexy outfits, beam down\/up (in a visual sense, at least), etc., it's all here in Forbidden Planet. The invisible id monster is truly horrifying when finally viewed. It looks like a serious rendition of the Tasmanian Devil.***SPOILER ALERT*** Don't read this brief paragraph if you don't want to know the monster's true identity. The concept that the monster is, in reality, the personification of Dr. Morbius' lower subconscious nature (i.e. the id, flesh or carnal psyche) is a fascinating revelation. ***END SPOILER*** I wasn't at all expecting such mature commentary in a 50's sci-fi flick.Furthermore, Dr. Morbius' elaboration on the former inhabitants of his planet, the Krell, is fascinating to this day and the archaic special effects hold up well.One thing that really blows me away every time I catch this flick, of course, is Anne Francis, who plays Altaira (or Alta for short), in her ultra skimpy (and cute) outfits. It doesn't matter what profound matters are going on in the film, if she's present in a scene with one of her various outfits, my eyes are completely focused on HER -- in utter awe of her jaw-dropping beauty. If you're a red-blooded male and think I'm kidding, check out the flick and see for yourself.I've heard some people complain about the scene where we are led to believe that Alta (Francis) is skinny-dipping, only to plainly observe that she's wearing a loose skin-colored bathing suit. Is this a cop-out on the film-maker's part because it was 1956? Not at all because the bathing suit is clearly visible once she steps out of the water. Despite her sheltered innocent nature, let's give Alta some credit -- she was obviously playing a little coquettish joke on the Captain, to shock him and stir up his mounting desire (it absolutely worked!).Please remember that Forbidden Planet is from 1956 and so understandably has dated aspects, like the sound effects, small portions of goofy dialogue, etc. Regardless, it must be HAILED as the honored blueprint for numerous sci-fi films and TV series to come.GRADE A ","genre":null},{"date":"17 May 2013","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Released in 1956, I didn't see Forbidden Planet until a full 40 years later.
