Patch a doctor with a mission in the 1970s attempts to treat his patients with a medicine which modern science has overlooked for years humor. After a brief stint at a mental hospital where he realizes his ability and his want to help others, Patch enters medical school. It is here in medical school where he discovers his own methods of reaching patients as a cure to the false front he witnesses in his instructors and fellow students. While his patients and fellow staff members appreciate his approach, the higher powers disapprove of his unschooled methods and attempt to prevent him from practicing. Professor Wolcott (Bob Grunten) is a go by the rule book kind of guy and disapproves of Patch's unorthodox tactics, believing that Patch should be expelled from medical school. Patch not only wants to be a doctor, but also wants to be a clown; thus he combined the two professions. There are highs and lows to Patch Adams as there are in any movie.  At the beginning of the movie, we view Patch admitting himself to a mental institution, and he meets many different people and realizes how there is no person who has the same personality as anyone else. He then enters Virginia Medical School where he meets Corinne (Monica Potter), a female medical student and develops a crush on her, but a dangerous situation with a mental patient claims her life. Patch now faces the difficult task of graduating school. Will he make it to graduation? Watch and find out. Patch Adams is a great movie, because it deals with real life characters and events. The clothing and music were both appropriate for the time period. I liked the setting for where Patch builds his shelter which gives a good feeling of home. If I were to rate this film, I would give two thumbs up.
