[{"date":"20 January 2001","score":"4 out of 13 people found the following review useful","review":"  Rounders was a movie that progressed at an average pace.  It never had a hugely suspensful string of scenes, but then again, it wasnt that type of a movie.  It had solid acting from Matt Damon and Edward Norton.  John Malkovich gave a great performance with a terrific Russian accent.Matt Damon's performance was very reminnescent of that which he gave in Good Will Hunting.  The character Damon plays in Rounders is same type of poor, working guy who is smarter than all of his friends.  I think this is Damon's best type of performance.  Given that he was excellent in The Talented Mr. Ripley, which is one of my favorite movies, Damon's ability to play the regular type of guy is what makes him so likeable.  He can pull it off better than anyone else today.Rounders takes time to develop.  It makes the watcher learn the intricate parts of different types of poker games.  If you don't like gambling or poker, keep your distance from this one.  In the grand scheme of things, rounders is a good poker movie.  It is better than The Cincinatti Kid, but of course it can't hold a candle to The Sting.  Either way, its an enjoyable movie, with a good soundtrack, and really nice cinematography. Kudos to the director.   ","genre":null},{"date":"20 January 2001","score":"4 out of 13 people found the following review useful","review":"  Rounders was a movie that progressed at an average pace.
