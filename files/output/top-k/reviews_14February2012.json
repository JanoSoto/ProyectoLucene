They are all sure the driver must be dead but when they get to him they find that he isn't quite gone; before dying he tells them how he has buried $350,000 under the 'Big W' in Santa Rosita State Park... and so begins a madcap chase as the drivers and their passengers do everything they can to make sure that they get there first. They include Dentist Melville Crump and his wife, Trucker Lenny Pike, a pair of comedy writers named Dingy and Benjy and Mr Finch, is wife and his battle-axe of a mother in law. Along the way they are joined by Lt. Col. J. Algernon Hawthorne, a British officer and the devious Otto Meyer. On the way they frequently fall out with each other, crash and have to find new vehicles and on one case even get locked in the basement of a hardware store! All the while they race towards the money they have no idea that the police led by Captain Culpepper of the Santa Rosita Police Department is watching every move they make. Most of the characters are just greedy and fairly unlikeable and that is what makes it so funny when yet another thing goes wrong for them. Even when it looks like it is all over and the money is found there is a twist that leads to somebody we hadn't even realised was in the race runs off with the cash with the others in pursuit! While the plot of this film is as simple as it gets it is a lot of fun watching the top quality cast get into a series of hilarious scrapes... it even manages to make the old cliché of slipping on a banana peel funny; largely because it couldn't have happened to a more deserving person! The greedy gang includes such comic talents as Phil Silvers, Terry Thomas, Ethel Merman, Mickey Rooney and Sid Caesar and playing it straight is Spencer Tracy as Capt. Culpepper; the man who has been waiting fifteen years to close the case of the stolen money. The action sequences look great as cars race recklessly along the mountainous desert roads; unfortunately when we see close-ups of the cars' occupants the back projection is fairly obvious although I don't know how that problem could have been avoided back then. At over two and a half hours in length, longer in some versions, the film is a bit on the long side however it does have enough laughs to sustain this length and only a few scenes drag a bit. Another thing in this film's favour compared to most modern comedies is the fact that it never relies on smut or bad language to get a laugh so is suitable for people of all ages. If you haven't seen it already check it out; it's a classic for a reason!

This is because it deals with the rawest human emotions and vulnerabilities and shows that when life is tough the need for community is greatest. Even if, maybe especially if, the members of that community are as dysfunctional and scarred as we are. For many of the characters in this movie life has been very tough indeed. The restaurant where Johnny gets a job, and where Frankie works, is at the centre of the lives of many of its regulars. It does not have Community Centre on a sign above the door &#x96; but this is, in effect, what it is. The tolerant proprietor, Nick, sympathetically portrayed by Hector Elizondo, has built that community and he is as protective of his customers as he is of his staff. Nick is a Greek-American and it is subtly suggested that the customers and employees at his little restaurant are a sort of extended Greek family - although in fact they are as ethnically diverse as New York can be.Frankie and Johnny is above all about loneliness. Frankie has a real family &#x96; we see them at the beginning at a christening &#x96; but it is clear that they have their own lives and that Frankie, partly out of choice, is not really part of that world. As the film develops we start to realise that Frankie's introspection and the barriers she erects around herself are attributable to a couple of failed relationships in the past. In one her partner left her for her best friend and in the other she was physically abused to the extent that she cannot have children. Johnny is equally damaged. We see him released from prison but it is not until quite late in the film that it is revealed that his crime, whilst serious, was a one-off fraud and that he is no serial offender. In prison he learnt to cook and that is now more than just a job to him &#x96; it has become a passion. Johnny was married but his wife left him and took their two children into a new relationship. There is a brief poignant vignette when Johnny watches his children with their mother and new father in an American dream suburban family scene &#x96; complete with white picket fence. He leaves without revealing his presence.From early in the movie it is clear that Frankie and Johnny are made for each other. Despite the wounds they carry (actual physical wounds to her head in Frankie's case) they are good caring people &#x96; albeit that like Nick they do this without wearing a Social Worker badge. Frankie has a moving relationship with a Gay neighbour, Tim (Nathan Lane) that manages to avoid being patronising or clichéd. Similarly her bonding with her fellow workers is natural and important to them all &#x96; not least Cora the archetypal strong, no-nonsense New York woman who, deep down, is as lonely as she is. Like all the characters Cora is deeper than, and different to, her veneer. When a woman heavily pregnant with twins comes to the restaurant she touches her belly and says People think I'm a tough b*tch, but it ain't true. Sh*t like this chokes me up. That Frankie and Johnny will eventually end up happily together seems obvious form the start, but that doesn't always happen in the movies does it? Along the way they battle, largely out of fear on Frankie's side. Johnny ardour is declared early on and we don't doubt that it is genuine. Frankie is more circumspect &#x96; unsurprisingly given the extent that she has been damaged by her last relationships. So whilst the romance is strong a happy ending is not certain and when it happens we are grateful because it is uplifting to think that even if the barriers are high they can sometimes be removed in the interests of true love.The casting of Frankie and Johnny is very good and all the minor characters, however crazy they may be are utterly credible because they are so well played. As for the leads both Pacino and Pfeiffer give sensitive and credible performances although both of them are so devastatingly good looking that they do seem a bit out of place amongst the ordinary New Yorkers who are very West Side in appearance rather than Upper East. Not many of them shop on Fifth Avenue whereas Frankie and Johnny do look a bit like people who habitually do this, except on dress-down day. Nevertheless although they are younger and lovelier than the characters in the original stage play (Frankie and Johnny in the Clair De Lune) this works fine and doesn't detract from the heart and the humanity of the story.A year or so after Frankie and Johnny was released the long running TV series Friends premiered. One of the central characters in Friends was, of course, Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston) who was initially a waitress in a Coffee House with a history of complex and damaging relationships behind her. Rachel Green is not Frankie &#x96; but there is a strong parallel not least because it is friends in both cases who provide the support when it's needed. Frankie says at one point I'm afraid. I'm afraid to be alone, I'm afraid not to be alone. I'm afraid of what I am, what I'm not, what I might become, what I might never become. I don't want to stay at my job for the rest of my life but I'm afraid to leave. And I'm just tired, you know, I'm just so tired of being afraid.

Of course, with the equally extravagant source material, I would expect the adaptation to be horrifically cut and toned down, washing away all the excitement of the manga, and though a lot has changed, Otomo has certainly done very, very well.The music is beyond brilliant; it gets you heart racing when it wants, it frightens you to death in the nightmare scenes, and it breaks your heart in the sad scenes. Throughout the film, I couldn't stand up, do anything else, or press the pause button. In fact, I stayed sat down, watching the end credit sequence. I was so impressed by its beauty, that I got that glorious feeling of crying, as you so do after such a brilliant film.There are a few very mild criticisms though, as the film is not without very minor flaws. The more recent English dub by Pioneer Sound is certainly more impressive than the previous Streamline sound version, but the best way to watch it is definitely in the original Japanese with subtitles on. Even if you're one of those people who hates having subtitles on, no matter what, it's much better the way it was originally written. The American voices often sound very silly and they draw away from the wonder of the story. And also, they cut out some parts from the actual film, and edited the music (no creepy organs, or 80's style action riffs!) due to some reasons I've yet to understand.Another small criticism I'd like to give is the story. Given the 2,000 A4-size page material that Otomo originally wrote and had to adapt into a 2 hour motion picture, he did a very, very good job at getting all of the most suited bits and making the necessary changes. But, if you're a casual film-goer, you may miss the points and end up lost. As for clever people, they will spot everything and realise all of the points, and the clever but complex story will affect them as it did with myself. The first time I saw it, I loved the spectacle but barely understood it, but the second time (after I'd read the books) I fell in love with the story too.I'm not sure what else to say... great story, great plot, great characters and voice performance (in the Japanese version at least), and the animation is remarkable, even for today! At 26 frames-per-second and all of the complex action, it's certainly a wonder how they achieved nearly everything with hand-drawn, hand-painted cells. It's at the level that we can only achieve with CGI today... and this is only a few artists on paper in a studio, with few computers involved.If you love anime, you HAVE to watch this film at some point. I wouldn't recommend this to anybody who won't pay attention to it, but any film- goers who love a great story along with superb spectacle, this film is totally worth it.Overall 10.0\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 February 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" It's such a huge surprise that Katsuhiro Otomo managed to pack so much wonder, beauty and pure cinematic perfection into only two hours of film.

I was so impressed by its beauty, that I got that glorious feeling of crying, as you so do after such a brilliant film.There are a few very mild criticisms though, as the film is not without very minor flaws. The more recent English dub by Pioneer Sound is certainly more impressive than the previous Streamline sound version, but the best way to watch it is definitely in the original Japanese with subtitles on. Even if you're one of those people who hates having subtitles on, no matter what, it's much better the way it was originally written. The American voices often sound very silly and they draw away from the wonder of the story. And also, they cut out some parts from the actual film, and edited the music (no creepy organs, or 80's style action riffs!) due to some reasons I've yet to understand.Another small criticism I'd like to give is the story. Given the 2,000 A4-size page material that Otomo originally wrote and had to adapt into a 2 hour motion picture, he did a very, very good job at getting all of the most suited bits and making the necessary changes. But, if you're a casual film-goer, you may miss the points and end up lost. As for clever people, they will spot everything and realise all of the points, and the clever but complex story will affect them as it did with myself. The first time I saw it, I loved the spectacle but barely understood it, but the second time (after I'd read the books) I fell in love with the story too.I'm not sure what else to say... great story, great plot, great characters and voice performance (in the Japanese version at least), and the animation is remarkable, even for today! At 26 frames-per-second and all of the complex action, it's certainly a wonder how they achieved nearly everything with hand-drawn, hand-painted cells. It's at the level that we can only achieve with CGI today... and this is only a few artists on paper in a studio, with few computers involved.If you love anime, you HAVE to watch this film at some point.

He creates a simple thread, which at first you can very easily follow. Something about looking for some girl missing, or some old coin, or find some blackmailer. This we start doing always with the detective, usually Marlowe, as our surrogate. We know what he knows, from the facts that get to him, to his thoughts - easily transpired in the books, but many times tawdry represented in films, as off voice. But every time, the unfolding of the initially simple investigation becomes filled with contradictory events, an incredible amount of new characters, and endless possibilities for explanation of the story. We get lost. So does Marlowe. And that's the point. We find ourselves suddenly pushed around, by everybody, all our mental mechanisms of understanding the story betrayed at every moment. We fall into the black hole, like Marlowe when he gets hit in the head. As if we experienced the hallucinogenic effect of the drugs that take Marlowe's notion of time and space away.This is truly powerful writing, when you think of the concept. Not great literature in the specific qualities of literature as art, but very good narrative concept. These detective stories are never about exactly how everything happen. In the end the explanation is so complicated that it becomes impossible to make credible, or so simple that it lacks interest. This is no Agatha Christie, where the intellectual mechanics of the story is what drives you to go with it. Here what matters is the world in which the story takes place, the rules of the universe where the characters live. These are literary characters, living in a literary world of their own, with very specific rules.When you bring this powerful concepts, and mix them with film, than you have something really worthy. That's what happened when filmmakers working in Hollywood, supported by visual ideas developed in Germany 10 years before, started to use this otherwise minor literature. In 1941 we had the Maltese Falcon, the first truly developed noir film, in this narrative sense. This means that when we get to this film, 3 years later, the genre is still developing, but already totally in inscribed in the mind of the viewer. This film understands what this is all about. It is competent in how it is able to cast us into the chaos of an unexplainable world. Marlowe is a pawn, from the beginning, when he finds Moose inside his office without being able to put him out or refuse his request. Actually I find it interesting how this Marlowe is much more vulnerable to the pushing around by every character than Bogart's typical Marlowe. I suppose without Bogart on the boat, the writers were able to take liberties with the character. What we have here is not the character of Chandler's books, but it's interesting to see Marlowe as a poor manipulated fellow, permanently on the edge.The problem is actually the actor. It is very rare for me to be put off by a poor performance, but in a film like this, with the central role of the detective as our surrogate in the narrative, if the actor fails so deeply as Powell failed here, the film is seriously damaged. Bogart was always limited as an actor, but at least he had enough self-awareness to project his own unique character and carry the film with it. Not Powell, all those facial gimmicks, denounced expressions. The director doesn't help, the editing is not fair for the actors (specially the men), but that's no excuse for all the distracting elements of Powell's performance. And Anne Shirley shines much more brightly than Claire Trevor.

Perfect film to watch around October and Halloween.Find it, buy it, watch it. Let's just hope Carpenter has at least one more like this still in him. By the way, I lived in New Hampshire and I'm pretty sure there aren't giant cathedrals and monsters there. Beautiful state, go visit.

I loved the novel, however as I knew this was in Bertolucci's hands - It was a risky one. First of all this is Bertolucci's take on the novel, its certainly not mine. It does not capture the spirituality of the novel, nor the sense of life, death and everything in between. it tends to focus on what a lot of his work tends to focus on and show lots of bush and sex. That said Debra Winger is a very attractive lady - but it is off putting when you're getting half a clown on while trying to come to terms with a sad and tragic love story. The trailer describes The Sheltering Sky as a womans 'dangerous and erotic journey' - sadly this is what the director opted for- stripping away the character of Kit down to someone who simply needs a screw. Debra Winger and John Malcovich are great in their parts and with a little more care and attention from a director trying to make the story tragic and beautiful instead of trying to show Debra Wingers body as much as possible, it could have been GREAT. I enjoyed it however, as I love the characters from the novel, so deep and rich and real and along with the setting and superior acting it did stir something in me apart from the obvious. I give it 7 out of 10 read the book instead. ","genre":null},{"date":"14 February 2012","score":"","review":" I'm not a fan of Bernado Bertolucci.
