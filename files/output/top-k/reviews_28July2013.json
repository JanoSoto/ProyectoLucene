One, I have not read the book, which I think in most cases is a good thing when one reviews a movie as it sets an unrealistic point of reference across mediums with varying strengths and weaknesses. A film should stand on its own regardless of however far it has (or hasn't) strayed from any source material. Two, I admit to not understanding what exactly the point of this film is. Maybe it's because I didn't grow up in the 70's, or because I'm not a girl\/woman; I don't really know.The first third or so of this film (before Trip's introduction) is dreamy and mesmerizing. The plot line likes to float a little, but used correctly it can leave the audience that much more interested in whatever over arching theme is being presented. I especially enjoy the awkward teenage humor not to mention the humor innate in the narrator's reflection on his youth. There's some very vivid imagery that would seem to lead to some character development and we get to learn a little about the people whose perspective we're getting the story from. The calm surrounding such a young and seemingly unprovoked suicide also adds some serious intrigue. As an audience, we're all asking ourselves why, or after some thought, what clever ripples will resonate throughout these characters' lives? Unfortunately, what made this first bit so darkly magical is jerked away in a flash. Abruptly the film shifts to focus solely on one sister, Lux, and even then we are only really witness to her actions, not who she is. The argument is of course that this is precisely what part the boys\/narrator sees, but without really knowing who's telling the story, there's no real way to connect the dots, to gain any understanding what level of profundity this has on our spectators or how much gravity it holds. Does any of this affect THEIR actions? Do they change what they think because of watching Lux, or are they simply mystified by Lux? We're all mystified by Lux by now, and I'm mystified at why the film isn't spending much time on why we aren't asking any questions about the other sisters aside from why are they even there? From here on out, The Virgin Suicides takes on an episodic approach that in effect shows us what we've already been shown about Lux (that she's rebellious), reinforces the isolation of the remaining three sisters, and continues the theme of bewilderment by the boys. I don't have a problem with any of this; what I wish is that the movie had explored the consequences of this behavior, the impact that these changing opinions and lifestyles had on the characters. But in this film, the characters are all very fuzzy to begin with and only remain fuzzy. We know the changing situations affect them, but not in an emotionally, relatable way.The appropriate and expected shock moment comes and goes with all the reflective voice-over, yet there's no gratification. OK, I can live with not exactly understanding why the girls did what they did, I understand that the film isn't about them, it's about the boys who observed them. But with all the contact near the end and the invitation to the boys to discover the horror, there's no sense in why the girls wanted to share this sort of twisted intimacy with people who didn't even seem to be their friends. Furthermore, the audience is alienated even more because we don't know the boys\/narrator either! Frankly, the two main parties involved in this film didn't know enough about each other to produce a substantial impact. And I really hope someone doesn't read this and think something like the whole point is how this tragedy between barely-acquaintances can stick with you... I mean maybe that is the point, but it's not a very good one, and it went through some really interesting stuff to get to a really dull conclusion.I like it, its fun to watch, but there's such a disparate element to all of what's presented that I find myself not believing that it actually ended without any further revelation.

The night after I finished my second experience of Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries, I couldn't sleep, invaded by countless thoughts about the purpose of my life, questioning every single choice I had to make since I was given that privilege, and ultimately wondering which path my sentimental life would have taken, had my heart not picked the chosen one. Wild Strawberries chronicles a series of occurrences such as melancholic reveries, nightmares, nostalgic reminiscences or real-life encounters during the unforgettable journey of Dr. Isaak Borg, an affable and educated 78-year old physician, who must travel from Stockholm to Lund to receive a Doctoris Jubilaris celebrating the 50th year after his doctorate. From our perspective, there's no doubt that Isaak was and is still an honorable man. Early in the film, he stops at a gas station and a young Max Von Sydow rememorizes the days when Isaak was a general practitioner, speaking very highly of good old Doctor Isaak Borg.If not a flawless man, Isaak immediately inspires our respect and admiration, and this is a credit to the Swedish veteran actor Victor Sjöström who exudes a powerful mixture of charismatic wisdom and sympathetic shyness. These traits are often branded as coldness by his entourage, but we personally suspect that only a defensive mind, such as his pregnant daughter-in-law Marianne, played by a breathtakingly beautiful Ingrid Thullin, would be so critical of Isaak's manners. However, as the story progresses, and as we get deeper in the relationships between Isaak and his mother, and with his son Ewald, played by the inevitable Gunnar Björnstrand, we realize that maybe, Isaak inherited from his mother (and Ewald from Isaak) this strange capability to inspire defensive mechanisms from the others. And maybe the key of some mistakes that might have undermined his life can only be drained from the well of memories.Wild Strawberries features an enigma of a man told from the other's perspectives. Given its surrealistic undertones, the film is ahead of its time, but not quite. I found personally ironic that Bergman loathed so much Citizen Kane when he unconsciously borrowed some elements from Orson Welles, except that the mystery doesn't focus on a man who's dead, but on a man who contemplates death at the twilight of his life, and wonders which other paths could have brought more happiness in his life. And as a genuine genius, Bergman understood the value of the road-movie format for character studies, that would inspire such memorable movies as Five Easy Pieces, Easy Rider, Woody Allen's Deconstructing Harry or Alexander Payne's About Schmidt.The road format is indeed crucial, as if the way that leads to our soul's abysses were like some tortuous roads with as many encounters as there are facets in our personalities. During Isaak's journey's, the most significant moment occurs when he picks up three young hitchhikers among them a lively blonde girl, Sara, played by a young Bibi Anderson. And Papa Isaak (the tender nickname she gives him) grows reciprocally fond of her, thinking back of Sara, her youth's sweetheart, as if she was resurrecting the old sparkle that defined his younger years, or reopened the concealed wound of having let Sara her slip from his hands, to one of his cousins.Each scene of Wild Strawberries carries a symbolic resonance, an embittered couple reminds of his failed marriage and a sordid episode where he symbolically lost his wife and didn't try to conquer her back, out of guilt or an apathetic weakness, surrendering to the humiliating weight of fatality. The most significant episode of the film is still the titular one, where plunged in a deep meditation, Isaak finds himself in his family cottage at the seaside, with Sara, the girl he used to court in the wild strawberries patch. Ingmar, like Proust for literature, invented a symbol to define the most cherished places of our childhood. Sadly enough, Isaak's cookie-Proust left a bitter taste. And while the pieces of the puzzle are assembled during this unforgettable road trip, Borg's odyssey highlights many aspects of his life and memories, inviting us in retrospect to question the value of our own lives. As usual, in Bergman's films, there are two levels of appreciations, as we follow the story of protagonists, we're tunneled into our own soul and are invited to meditate on the meaning of our lives, even more because we (contrarily to Isaak) can afford hope. And so does Marianne who embodies our perspective and refuses to see her husband inheriting the same traits Isaak took from her mother. Marianne's future is the fresh air that extinguishes some of Isaak's demons. For it is wise to learn from our mistakes, but even wiser and nobler to help other people to learn from ours. And this might be what the 'wild strawberries' stand for, a cinematic metaphor for this state of felicity following a great achievement. As a poet said it's when you have reached the mountain top, that you shall begin to climb. No doubt that Isaak was finally climbing his way to some peace of mind at the end of the journey.Wild Strawberries is a humanistic masterpiece inviting us to discover ourselves, to find eternal peace and happiness through our memories. This is not 'inner child' material but a survival move guided by the nihilism induced by life as a linear movement toward death, ruled by mistakes, but paved by achievements, the very tools we use to build a personal history and connect it with our family's, thus contributing to the never-ending transmission of life.If Isaak's experience can contribute to the happiness of his son, his daughter-in-law or a young stranger, his life had a purpose after all... in this vaster scheme driven by the superior forces Ingmar Bergman tried to touch through his Art, like he did, the same year with another masterpiece The Seventh Seal.

All three movies have a similar story , but it was Ted Kotcheff's (director of &#x85; Rambo  First blood  made in 1982 ) movie that first used such story . Furthermore , it's actually based on real life story of Green Beret Colonel Bo Gritz (read the F.A.Q.) . From this three movies I think that Rambo 2 is the best movie and Missing in action the worst. Uncommon valor is forgotten , but fun movie that is worth watching.It's always a pleasure to have a Gene Hackman in a movie .

His life shattered, he returns from a 'vacation' in Arizona (where he watches an 'Old West' show, where justice was made with guns) with a new mindset to kill criminals at night, as a vigilante.His actions spark the interest of the media as the people of NY start following in his footsteps and fighting back on muggers and burglars. This doesn't bode well with the politics and the police, though, as officer Frank Ochoa (even if he isn't fully unsympathetic to the vigilante's actions) is determined to catch the vigilante.Speaking about the movie itself, it is very good. Charles Bronson is great, one of the best tough guys in cinema history and still far better than most action stars from today. He makes a very good job as the disillusioned Paul Kersey. Vincent Gardenia, as Frank Ochoa, makes an adequate 'nemesis'. The movie is never dull, and quite gripping at most times.The one criticism I have is that the police had no real way to incriminate him, and he knew it, but was still scared. All of his actions WERE technically self-defense, and it wouldn't be difficult to prove at all.However, 'Death Wish' goes beyond just your typical action\/cop thriller. At a time when crime was high in big cities, it invited a question most make themselves even today how can we, the 'common citizens', react to crime? Is taking the matter on our hands, resorting to vigilantism, just another crime, or is it another face of justice? It is surprising, how people seem to love vigilantes in pure fiction (like 'Batman') yet they frown on such behavior on a more real situation. How they prefer to place the fault of crime on others, on the corruption of 'society', on politics or even on the poverty, and make the criminals look like the victims. 'They are still people! They have to be treated well, it's not their fault they did what they did!' Like Paul Kersey at the movie's beginning, to the point of being called a 'bleeding-heart liberal'... that is, before his only family ends attacked. Then the 'victims of society' become criminals who deserve death. Yet the movie is not overly one-sided, and actually questions Kersey's morality. His actions are, legally speaking, self-defense he never actually attacks people just for their looks, but waits to be attacked first (he later 'lures' the criminals, though it still is their choice to attack him). But the fact that he made himself into the judge\/jury\/executioner leads to the understanding that he considers himself above the law, and we see that he is not totally sane at all (his reactions to guns near the beginning, plus the trauma of his wife and daughter being attacked), showcasing another side of the vigilante.How easy is it to go from a righteous self-defense to flat-out murder? How easy is it to lose control? How thin would the line separating crime and justice be in this situation?It is a point for reflection, one that can truly touch the viewer and might even change how he enjoys the film. If you believe his revenge can actually be justice, or if he by the end he became just another criminal... That is a strong discussion. I have my reservations on the subject, truth be told.I liked the film, its violence actually serving a purpose rather than being done just for kicks, the actors brought the needed realism that make it work so well and the action makes it never dull.

The 2012 movie Dredd is better movie and more accurate adaptation of the comic book.Judge Dredd is a movie caught between director Danny Cannon (fan of the comic) will and Stallone\/studio insistence on making a standard popcorn fare. I can understand the hate of comic book fans for this movie to some extent. Hollywood took a dark, sarcastic, satirical comic and turned it into lightweight summer action movie. In terms of character and plot it is, by any objective standards, a failed adaptation. The history of the 2000AD universe is significantly messed around with . However , it really isn't the directionless adaptation some insist it is. It got all the basics of some challenging material right. Mega City One looks terrific. The casting was absolutely spot-on Dredd, Hershey, Fargo, McGruder, Griffin... all these actors looked and behaved exactly as their 2000AD counterparts. Fergie wasn't the same as his comic-book counterpart, but the movie version of him is much better than original. The costumes were also brilliant . We have also a cool Hammerstein robot from the ABC Warriors and the Angel Gang. Mean Machine is exactly as he is in the comic book. There are delicate hints of totalitarianism and traces of satire as well.The movie has political overtones and a pessimistic view of future where technology and social conventions are leading humans. The whole concept of the judges and their hierarchical structure is fascinating. Too bad that the movie never really explores those interesting ideas. It could be thought provoking film.Another problem is that the plot has it's share of plot holes and dumb moments . There is also too much of shouting (because for the filmmakers shouting equals big drama , obviously) which makes some of the scenes cringe worthy.Sylvester Stallone and Armand Assante both give a hammy performances as the undestructable hero and crazy villain. They have their moments of good acting , but mostly they overacting. It is however completely intentional , as you can see that they not taking their roles seriously , so in the end your having fun with them. Rob Schneider mostly irritates as the comic relief, however he does have some occasional funny moments (the voice impression , I'm alive&#x85;oh, so are you , We don't have time for that) and he helps Dredd twice near the end of the movie. Diane Lane is OK as Dredd's friend\/love interest , even if the movie doesn't really give her much to do. Max Von Sydow adds a touch of class to the whole movie. Jurgen Prochnow is uneven &#x96; sometimes good , sometimes bad. Joan Chen makes a rather pointless appearance (probably for catfight only ?).The special effects are OK , if not little dated in some places (the chase). The music by alan Silvestri is great &#x96; catchy and heroic. I liked the one-liners - I am the law , I knew you would say that.The movie is fast paced, loud , colorful and brash but not in an insulting way like Schumacher's Batman movies. It has a charm and personality that seems to have been lost in modern comic book adaptations which seem to be either very dark , gritty and serious or slaves to special effects.It's not a bad movie. It's a obvious crowd pleaser which doesn't take itself too seriously. An adequate blockbuster. Mindless fun. (unlike say Michael Bay movies which are just annoying). There are far worse comic book movies and movies overall than Judge Dredd. I give it 5\/10.

The movie was shot in 3-D, since in 1953 the movies Bwana Devil and House of Wax started a 3-D craze. But that lasted just after the release of Dial M, and therefore this movie was mostly played in 2-D. Because it's mainly set in an apartment's living room, the movie was shot in only 36 days.Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) is an ex professional tennis player who retired because his wife Margot (Grace Kelly) complained about his busy schedule and started an affair with Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). Out of jealousy, Tony decides to meet with an old acquaintance to blackmail him into murdering his wife by following a plan Tony alone devised.Being an adaptation of a play, the movie is primarily based on smart dialogue that carries the plot and manages to keep us interested while the characters try to solve the mystery, even though we know from the beginning what has happened. This is one of the things I liked the most about the movie. Then, there is the great acting Ray Milland is constantly indifferent, cold, extremely rational and doesn't let emotions interfere with his horrid plan. Grace Kelly is a typical damsel in distress but doesn't know who her saviour is supposed to be, and Robert Cummings would do anything for her. All of them, along with the supporting cast, are very convincing in their roles. That's probably why it's easy to empathise with everyone, no matter their actions.Since, like I said, Dial M was mostly shot in a living room, many people have talked about the movie as claustrophobic. I would rather say the lack of open spaces gives this movie a feeling of inevitability and hopelessness &#x96; nobody can escape their fate and we're all responsible for our actions. This also proves how much Dial M relies on good acting. Another thing I loved about this movie (and old movies in general) is the thoughtful use of soundtrack. Nowadays, the majority of mainstream movies try to evoke feelings in the audience by being too loud all the time, and that's when a soundtrack loses its purpose. In conclusion, Dial M might not appeal to all Hitchcock fans because of the lack of action and long dialogues, but it's an excellent movie nobody should miss.Rating 8\/10 Read more at http\/\/passpopcorn.wordpress.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"28 July 2013","score":"","review":" Hitchcock's Dial M for Murder is an adaptation of the successful Broadway play of the same name by Frederick Knott.

I've read that amnesia doesn't work that way (but Bourne and Memento were okay--how about the old B&W classic Random Harvest?). Me, I never watched the thing for a lesson in abnormal psychology or traumatic amnesia, and I didn't watch Bruce Willis and Steve Buscemi fly out to an approaching asteroid to learn about space science or well drilling technology, or even Physics 101 (you want realism, the fragments would have destroyed planet Earth, The End).I've read that our or our allied governments would never stage or allow a contract false flag or large scale pre-emptive attack as portrayed by Chapter, in TLKGN (but it was okay in Three Days of the Condor, or in the Tonkin Gulf and a dozen other more recent historical actual events, for that matter).This is nonsense. Someone very high up didn't like the premise and Hollywood came down hard on Shane Black's story (perhaps because they were planning something very like that). It was action\/comedy not dissimilar to the Die Hard, etc. franchise, but it was made an example of. If you want to watch a realistic documentary-style production featuring intelligence agencies, then watch The Company or a half-dozen other offerings, NOT an action\/comedy romp full of explosions and some of the wittiest dialog since Gross Point Blank. I might just as well complain that documentaries and docu-dramas deserve a 1 out of 10 because they are not funny and move too slowly.I give this movie (which I and my partner own and have watched many times just for the acting and darkly comedic dialog, timing, and delivery) a 10 on it's own merits. Not because some reviewers overseas found it too Hollywood, or some thought it appealed to 14-year-olds (like 14-year-olds shouldn't be allowed movies aimed at them), or some refused to watch it yet still felt qualified to vote and express an opinion, all the other usual suspect reasons for panning a movie and trying to sound outraged or intelligent, or whatever. Even Ebert was upset that the hero and heroine outran a fireball--see, they never put that in action\/comedy movies because everyone knows it's impossible to outrun a fireball. (So what do we do, Rog, just end the movie there? They blew up, The End.) Please, reviewers, if escapist Hollywood action\/comedies are not your thing, stop reviewing stuff which offends your literal sensibilities, or which you did not bother to watch. Go review Heidi, or Wuthering Heights, or A River Runs Through it. But what's the point in comparing this sort of thing to Hitchcock and Bergman all the time? This movie is older than the age-group it was written for, and still stands out as a classic of its type (which includes Die Hard and Lethal Weapon). Ten out of ten.
