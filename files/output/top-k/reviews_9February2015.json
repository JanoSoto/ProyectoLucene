I believe Liam Neeson and Harrison Ford were excellent as Russian captains. The movie takes place in 1961, the Russians have a new nuclear submarine. Before it leaves it is to be christened. Once the champagne bottle is released, it fails to break. All the men of K-19 were shocked. This is usually a bad sign. The crew continues to get prepared to leave. Before leaving there is an accident involving a crew member, and one of the crew has to be replaced due to being drunk on duty. The crew led by Capt. Alexei Vostrikov( Harrison Ford), and Mikhail Polenin(Liam Neeson). During this time it is the height of the Cold War. K-19 is heading toward American waters. It seems all is going well until Lt. Vadim Radtchinko(Peter Sarsgaard) notices the temperature start to rise outside the nuclear reactor room. The controls signify there is a small leak starting in the reactor room. Radtchinko relays this to Polenin, and Vostrikov. The crew must stop it before a disaster like Hiroshima happens. Polenin decides the men must work in shifts, but it keeps getting worse. When going to get the proper equipment the sub only has chemical suits, no radiation suits. The situation gets worse the men know they are doomed, but they must control the leak for a chance of survival. The men go in two's, 10 minutes max in the reactor room. They continue this until the leak is somewhat controlled. All the men take their turn except the Lt.(Sarsgaard) he freezes which doesn't look good, the men, and Polenin are disappointed. They do get the leak slowed down, and it holds for awhile, but eventually it begins again. This time it is worse, and Radtchinko vows not to let the Captains or the men down. He goes in, and tries to control it himself. The crew is hot, suffering from radiation sickness; and the readings are off the chart. Thus begins the waiting game until help can arrive. Once K-19 reaches American waters, The U.S. Navy offers assistance, but Vostrikov refuses. Making the men and Polenin wonder why. Vostrikov says he will not turn his back on Mother Russia, he will not be guilty of treason. The crew is suffering, they arrest Vostrikov and make Polenin lead captain. Polenin at first looks as if he will take this honor, but instead backs his captain. Polenin releases Vostrikov, and those that try to stage the munity I believe are arrested.. This is where I feel Vostrikov is suffering from radiation sickness, and Polenin is probably in the beginning stages. The men are dying, and almost all of them have high radiation levels. From this point the leak gets worse most men are too sick to work in shifts, and the radiation levels keep rising. Vostrikov suffering from radiation sickness, realizes he needs to get his men off this sub ASAP. He calls Moscow, but the request gets denied. He tells Polenin he wants them off ASAP. Polenin reminds him it would mean the end of his military career for in subornation. At this point Vostrikov doesn't care, in awhile another sub comes; and helps rescue the men. The men are decontaminated, and taken aboard. After the rescue Polenin, and Vostrikov get checked at the hospital along with their crew. Once they are able, a trial for in subornation begins. The damage is done, a lot of the men aboard the K-19 eventually end up losing their lives which Vostrikov and Polenin will live with forever.This story is based on a true story, and for 28 years the survivors could not tell their story until the fall of Communism in Russia. I really liked this film; and though I am a huge Neeson\/ Ford fan; it was the story that draws you in. The bravery, and sacrifice the crew went through, for the love of their Country was amazing.

Ray Tango (Sylvester Stallone) is a top L.A cop who works the big time and makes a lot of money which he shows off by the clothes and car he drives. The film starts in a fast car chase with Tango chasing a gas truck down the highway. He speeds in front and shoots the window, which in turns stops the truck. Police swarm in and start yelling at him for stopping a truck for no reason so he shoots the tank and cocaine pours out. One cop says to Tango he's reckless and thinks he's Rambo, Then Tango replies Rambo is a pussy. The action and the comedy at the start sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Gabe Cash (Kurt Russell) is a L.A cop who thinks he's the best and lives a lower class live. He goes after the guys that Tango won't waste his time on. These two end up pissing the main villain crime lord Yves Perret (Jack Palance) off, who sets in motion a plan to get Tango & Cash arrest and sent to a prison to have them killed, with the help of dirty cops. While in prison they end up joining forces to escape alive. They are tortured and beat up pretty bad, but with the help of Gabe Cash's friend and former commanding officer they make it to the top of the prison and use their belts to slide down a power line. They then go to Tango's sister's work, Katherine Kiki Tango (Teri Hatcher) helps them to her house. Cash and Kiki start to fall in love which pisses Tango off and there's a quick fight between the two. Soon Tango & Cash come together with a plan to stop for good Perret. They go to Cash's friend Owen (Michael J. Pollard) who loan them a weapon equipped truck and then they storm Perret's compound. Once inside they find out Perret's henchmen has Katherine, they end up killing the henchmen and then see Perret holding a gun to Katherine at which time Tango & Cash shoot him. They escape before the building explodes in the truck and joke about Cash wanting to date Katherine. It was a great movie with a lot of action and comedy. Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell play well of each other and use real life issues in their lives in the movie, like When Tango and Cash escape from the prison, Cash turns to Tango and asks if he stopped for coffee and a Danish.

The beginning of this movie is actually kind of laughable. Cubans and Soviets are parachuting into Colorado. They are randomly shooting civilians and rounding up undesirables into internment camps. The first scenes with what would become the Wolverines seem like a really hair-brained and paranoid gun ownership commercial, the kind that the NRA would laugh at and reject. The film is rather low budget even for its day, and it shows in places. Production values are nowhere near the quality of contemporary films such as Top Gun, Gremlins, or Fright Night. the camera work looks more similar to films like Prom Night or a made for TV series. The notable exception to this fact is that the military equipment really looks authentic, right down to the tail fin of the MiG-23 and the round turrets of the T-72s. Tony Scott should have taken note of this when he made Top Gun and used American owned MiGs in the fight sequences. Instead, he used obviously American F-5s painted black with red stars. However, as the story unfolds, this movie goes from laughable to downright touching and harrowing. Say what you want about the low budget, but some real time and effort was spent researching historical resistance movements. Anybody who has read Chuck Yeager's autobiography will recognize the plight of Michael Ironside as the downed airman helped by local resistance fighters. The reprisal killing of local men for the bombing of the Soviet command post is very reminiscent of the Nazi reprisals for the bombing death of Heydrich in occupied Czechoslovakia. The helicopter attack on the scavenging troops looks very much like footage of the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan. I would not doubt that the Soviets baited Muhajedin with food, as it was an obvious and obviously irresistible ploy to lure out starving enemy fighters. The movie was also good in that it showed what happens behind the scenes in a war. As armies fight each other on the front, counterinsurgency armies sweep the hills to flush out resistance. Occupation troops go on holiday in the film, much like the German Army mountaineers who planted the Nazi flag on Mount Erebus while their comrades were pinned down in nearby Stalingrad. Even the enemy has a human face as we see the Cubans and Soviets debate policy and lament problems in their supply lines. They are not comical villains, but actually very smart and at times sympathetic, driven, and even noble. They are 100% believable as professional soldiers serving their country. Ironically, this invasion story seems (at least to me) to be based most closely on the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The best sequence of the film is the one involving the tracking bug. How do you deal with the fact that your friend's family turned traitor and forced their son to do the same? How do you deal with executing your best friend for trying to kill you? How do you not simply expel him, knowing that he will likely be killed by the KGB for botching the job? How do you execute an enemy soldier your own age who is just as brave and committed as yourself? This was one of the best scenes in any movie of the 1980's, and it helped to elevate this film a notch toward classic territory. The 1980's were a time of increased tension between the superpowers. The American President, Ronald Reagan, came from a part of the country dominated by the motion picture and armaments industries. He ended détente as a way to please his core constituents and political patrons by creating a market for the weapons they produced. He created this market by playing up the confrontation with the Soviet Union. This created the need for a strong military and re-energized the Cold War. Years of detente with the Soviet Union ended, and a more aggressive stance followed. Likewise, the entertainment industry responded to this new political atmosphere by putting out many anti-Soviet themes in films and TV series. Numerous villains in GI Joe and Starblazers cartoons (among others) spoke with Russian accents. Those alive at the time will remember the miniseries Amerika and World War III, each of which discussed some type of Soviet invasion of the United States. These shows are every bit as ridiculous as you can remember or imagine. In this climate, it is quite remarkable to think that the creators of Red Dawn created a film as good as they did. Red Dawn is one of the few works of any kind to make the Soviet Invasion concept work in a way that appears realistic and believable, even if it ultimately proved to be too improbable to take place in reality. This movie may have its flaws, but it is not a stupid film by any means. The situations depicted in this movie really happen in every combat zone on every continent. I have no doubt that the Iraq and Afghan Wars were full of stories like this one. The movie was very prescient and wise in depicting the occupiers in the way that it did because, 20 years later, it would be the Americans that would find themselves playing out those same roles in a foreign land halfway around the world. This is a very well conceived film despite some of its weaknesses. It is just as relevant today as it was when it was made over thirty years ago.

This is a very well conceived film despite some of its weaknesses. It is just as relevant today as it was when it was made over thirty years ago. ","genre":"Action, Drama"},{"date":"9 February 2015","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I watched this one afternoon on the Esquire channel (I believe), because I just wanted to kill some time. The beginning of this movie is actually kind of laughable. Cubans and Soviets are parachuting into Colorado. They are randomly shooting civilians and rounding up undesirables into internment camps. The first scenes with what would become the Wolverines seem like a really hair-brained and paranoid gun ownership commercial, the kind that the NRA would laugh at and reject. The film is rather low budget even for its day, and it shows in places. Production values are nowhere near the quality of contemporary films such as Top Gun, Gremlins, or Fright Night. the camera work looks more similar to films like Prom Night or a made for TV series. The notable exception to this fact is that the military equipment really looks authentic, right down to the tail fin of the MiG-23 and the round turrets of the T-72s. Tony Scott should have taken note of this when he made Top Gun and used American owned MiGs in the fight sequences. Instead, he used obviously American F-5s painted black with red stars. However, as the story unfolds, this movie goes from laughable to downright touching and harrowing. Say what you want about the low budget, but some real time and effort was spent researching historical resistance movements. Anybody who has read Chuck Yeager's autobiography will recognize the plight of Michael Ironside as the downed airman helped by local resistance fighters. The reprisal killing of local men for the bombing of the Soviet command post is very reminiscent of the Nazi reprisals for the bombing death of Heydrich in occupied Czechoslovakia. The helicopter attack on the scavenging troops looks very much like footage of the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan. I would not doubt that the Soviets baited Muhajedin with food, as it was an obvious and obviously irresistible ploy to lure out starving enemy fighters. The movie was also good in that it showed what happens behind the scenes in a war. As armies fight each other on the front, counterinsurgency armies sweep the hills to flush out resistance. Occupation troops go on holiday in the film, much like the German Army mountaineers who planted the Nazi flag on Mount Erebus while their comrades were pinned down in nearby Stalingrad. Even the enemy has a human face as we see the Cubans and Soviets debate policy and lament problems in their supply lines. They are not comical villains, but actually very smart and at times sympathetic, driven, and even noble. They are 100% believable as professional soldiers serving their country. Ironically, this invasion story seems (at least to me) to be based most closely on the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The best sequence of the film is the one involving the tracking bug. How do you deal with the fact that your friend's family turned traitor and forced their son to do the same? How do you deal with executing your best friend for trying to kill you? How do you not simply expel him, knowing that he will likely be killed by the KGB for botching the job? How do you execute an enemy soldier your own age who is just as brave and committed as yourself? This was one of the best scenes in any movie of the 1980's, and it helped to elevate this film a notch toward classic territory. The 1980's were a time of increased tension between the superpowers. The American President, Ronald Reagan, came from a part of the country dominated by the motion picture and armaments industries. He ended détente as a way to please his core constituents and political patrons by creating a market for the weapons they produced. He created this market by playing up the confrontation with the Soviet Union. This created the need for a strong military and re-energized the Cold War. Years of detente with the Soviet Union ended, and a more aggressive stance followed. Likewise, the entertainment industry responded to this new political atmosphere by putting out many anti-Soviet themes in films and TV series. Numerous villains in GI Joe and Starblazers cartoons (among others) spoke with Russian accents. Those alive at the time will remember the miniseries Amerika and World War III, each of which discussed some type of Soviet invasion of the United States. These shows are every bit as ridiculous as you can remember or imagine. In this climate, it is quite remarkable to think that the creators of Red Dawn created a film as good as they did. Red Dawn is one of the few works of any kind to make the Soviet Invasion concept work in a way that appears realistic and believable, even if it ultimately proved to be too improbable to take place in reality. This movie may have its flaws, but it is not a stupid film by any means. The situations depicted in this movie really happen in every combat zone on every continent. I have no doubt that the Iraq and Afghan Wars were full of stories like this one. The movie was very prescient and wise in depicting the occupiers in the way that it did because, 20 years later, it would be the Americans that would find themselves playing out those same roles in a foreign land halfway around the world.

That doesn't happen often, but the movie was that good, even with a one-note plot, and no action or romance. Yes, it did bring back 60-year old memories, sometimes fond, sometimes not. First a few words on historical context.In the summer of 1955, Revlon cosmetics experimented with a big money quiz show, not sure how it would work in prime network time. It was called the $64,000 Question. Up to that point, quiz shows, whether radio or new-fangled TV, offered only small amounts of prize money. So this was an unimaginable amount to offer. Not surprisingly, the show was an immediate hit, earning a permanent place on the CBS network. Viewers were clearly enthralled, especially when a delicate little Dr. Joyce Brothers showed off her expert knowledge of Boxing, of all things. Thus, it was possible for contestants to win not only big money, but become minor celebrities in the process, that is, if they caught the public's fancy.Of course, network programming being a commercial enterprise, imitators soon followed, the most successful (I think) being Twenty-One. Unlike $64,000, it had the distinction of two contestants competing against one another from inside the famous isolation booths. There viewers could watch them sweat as they pondered their answers. The format was also a come-on since most everyone had played the simple card game of being the first to reach 21 in point count. I think this format had the most built-in drama of any other TV quiz show, which by 1956, were at least several.The movie, of course, exposes the biggest scandal in quiz show history, which occurred in 1956-57 on Twenty-One. I was in high school at the time and never missed these shows. I think it's fair to say that practically all viewers believed the shows were honest&#x97;I know my family did. And that's even when quiz-whiz Herb Stemple missed probably the easiest question asked him, namely, who won Best Picture Oscar from just 2-years earlier. We all shouted Marty at the screen while he appeared terminally stumped, and we felt suddenly superior to this know-it-all. Likely, more discerning viewers suspected something fishy from that point on. But remember, this was the 1950's when, coming off a triumphal big war, most everyone still believed unquestioningly in authority. My friends and family certainly did. So when the rigged nature of Twenty-One was exposed in 1959, the public was generally shocked, especially as fair-haired boy Charles Van Doren was implicated. In fact, the big money quiz format was so discredited, it didn't revive for many decades.The movie itself amounts to a narrative triumph. Skillfully scripted, acted, and produced. The contrast between the nerdy-looking Stemple and the aristocratic Van Doren is striking. So, in retrospect, it's not surprising that producers Barry and Enright would see real ratings potential in a good-looking guy with a well-known family name. Fiennes's smirking Van Doren comes across as a rather slimy character once he's been compromised. Still, that scene of him amid the outdoor intellectual gathering is one a commoner like me can only imagine. As a result, I can understand how he could be seduced into establishing a reputation separate from his illustrious father (Scofield). Then there's the blue-collar Stemple harrumphing around his cold-water flat, having trusted the producers to come through for him after he took the humiliating dive. At times he's almost a comedic figure in his thrashing about.I guess my only reservation is with Morrow's casting as the bulldog investigator Jim Goodwin. To me, he doesn't project the kind of force necessary for untangling the shenanigans or tangling with stone walling network bigshots. But then, maybe he's intended to be a Peter Falk type Columbo with his disheveled appearance and mild manner. Be that as it may, the network honcho's are well cast and appropriately slippery as they seduce Stemple and Van Doren with prize money and promises of network jobs. Viewers can almost see their numbers-crunching brains in action. Tellingly, no woman is featured in the two hour runtime; and as an odd moment of curiosity, there's no indication whether Van Doren's successor Vivian Nearing was fed her answers or not.Anyway, the movie's fascinating in what it shows about the corruptive potency of TV ratings and commercial sponsors, a risky marriage that nevertheless endures.

In Xander Cage's world, the stunts are more extreme and sporty, the parties are harder, the girls are sluttier, the locations are scuzzier, and there's absolutely no civility. Also in Cage's world, it's completely possible to make motorcycles jump in the air and flip around in impossible ways, you can start an avalanche with grenades and survive, and a GTO can be decked-out with every weapon imaginable. Despite all the dirt and toughness that goes into the character and his world, there's no masking the film's absurdities, with all its unbelievable stuntwork and silly turn of events. But, the film never makes a pretense to be anything but silly, juvenile fun. The film moves at a fast pace, has plenty of cool scenes, and it is every bit as fun of a movie as other guilty pleasure favorites in the genre (such as Charlie's Angels or Die Another Day).The plot is pretty tight and it feels complete, but it doesn't necessarily feel all that original, despite the unique premise of hiring a hardened criminal as a spy. The story has a lot of twists, which can strain believability even further, and become rather predictable. The characters are a fun bunch that are easy to watch and understand, but they are ultimately thin cardboard cutouts standing in for familiar archetypes. There is a hint of characterization around Xander, the man who starts off as a deviant and ends as a true good guy. Overall though, the film is safe, familiar, and outright derivative.The film has some really neat camera-work with a lot of good angles. Some scenes are pretty fast-cut and some are poorly shot, but by today's standards, it looks sharp and punchy. Acting is a bit over-the-top, but Vin Diesel is a lot of fun to watch as the main character, the villains are really good, the love interest isn't bad, and everybody else is okay. Writing is okay. This movie uses some really good-looking locales (mostly in Prague), as well as some okay-looking sets, props, and costumes. Special effects are pretty bad (especially the avalanche scene). The music score is decent; the film does tend to bust out with a lot of obnoxious rock and metal, but it fits.xXx is one silly action flick that can't really be taken too seriously, but as an absurd guilty pleasure, it is quite entertaining and fulfilling. There might even be some alternate universe where xXx is a halfway decent franchise; the roots for one are laid down pretty well in this film. Action movie fans should give this a rent at least once; you might think it's stupid, but you're bound to have plenty of fun with it.On home video, this movie is available with an unrated cut that inserts a few new scenes, which really aren't necessary at all. One scene is also altered to show more naked girls lying around, which is nice, but also unnecessary. I prefer the theatrical cut.3.5\/5 (Entertainment Very Good | Story Average | Film Marginal) ","genre":"Action, Adventure"},{"date":"9 February 2015","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" 'Mousehunt' was one of my favorites movies as a kid, thanks to its funny script, that held my attention, much more than I would've thought of.

Certainly that is the primary movie that it spoofs, but it extends to almost the entire sci-fi genre and beyond. If you're a huge fan of any Star Wars movies, particularly the old ones, don't be too turned off by this, or at least try not to view this film as an insult to the entire series. I'm not a Star Wars fan, but I am big into Lord of the Rings and I would love if they came out with a good satirical version of that. Mel Brooks does a pretty good job of converting the storyline of dramatic and serious sci-fi space movies into a comedy. Some of the character names are humorous adaptations of other character names, such as Lone Star, Yogurt, and Dark Helmet, but not all of them are used to generate laughs. The fundamental story line basically follows that of A New Hope, but it adds a few elements from Empire Strikes Back and even synthesizes a few plot points.The characters have distinct comedy styles, but their respective gags are constantly mixed with the other characters, giving the film some consistent variety. That said, all of the comedy is in slapstick style. Unlike Men in Tights, all of the characters have moments where they do something mildly humiliating (in a humorous way of course) and none are confident and error-less throughout. I won't get into the character personalities, but I will say who each one is representative of. Dark Helmet=Darth Vader, Lone Star=Luke Skywalker and Han Solo, Princess Vespa=Princess Leia, Barf=Chewbacca, Yogurt=Yoda, Dot=C3PO, and Colonel Sandurz= all extraneous military characters from space films. The only main character that has no real equivalent is President Skroob. I kind of feel like his character, though he comedy generated from him was decent, was kind of selfish on Mel Brooks part since he was already playing a main role as Yogurt.Though some of the comedy in spoof films is rather crude, it is nonetheless a good genre and has plenty of clean humor mixed in. There are a fair amount of situational jokes that make fun of lines or concepts from Star Wars, Star Trek, Alien, and sci-fi in general. Most of the verbal humor is independent and isn't typically used to make fun of anything (e.g. God willing we'll all come back for Spaceballs 2 The Search for More Money). It has a very strong slapstick air to it, and has a lot of the same style as Men in Tights. The PG rating is deceptive since it came out before PG-13 ratings were around, and modern ratings would likely credit this film with a low PG-13.The acting is pretty good and each part seems well cast, though the quality of the script is a matter of opinion more than anything else. Since there are a fair amount of sci-fi elements, the poor visual effects are displayed several times, but that kind of thing can sometimes improve a comedy as with Monty Python. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys satirical comedy of any kind. It's a good idea to at least have a general knowledge of any prominent sci-fi movie that came out before 87, though you can still enjoy the movie without that. It's okay to watch it with a group of friends, but probably not with anyone who's going to be offended by the ridicule of their favorite trilogy. If you're speculating whether it's worth you're time, I would recommend watching the first twenty minutes and turning it off if you think it's stupid. Overall Rating 8.1\/10.

His performance\/character is faultless and gives a completely different approach to so many other villains we see in the movies, he is calm, well educated, has an intelligent vocabulary, witty sarcasm and is brutally honest.

The greatest thing about him though is how he is caged off from the world in each of his scenes, like a monster, he isn't accessible and comes across as untouchable. The most baffling thing of all though is that despite Hopkins playing a serial killer cannibal who is criminally deranged, you actually have a strange sense of fondness towards him. At one point I felt myself feeling sorry for him, how is that even possible? Hats off to the creators and Anthony Hopkins for that to give the viewer that feeling, quite the achievement!Jodie Foster gives an incredible performance and this is easily my favourite out of all the roles she has played.

During their first meeting, the two 'hoods' aren't as dumb as they may look and enquire as to why he wishes to 'pay his own ransom.'

I won't go into too many details about what happens (or more importantly all the different ways things don't always work out the way you plan) as that's half the fun. The only thing you really need to know is that there are no car chases and the one shoot out is hardly akin to something you'd see in a Matrix film.

I won't go into too many details about what happens (or more importantly all the different ways things don't always work out the way you plan) as that's half the fun. The only thing you really need to know is that there are no car chases and the one shoot out is hardly akin to something you'd see in a Matrix film. The film ambles along from one beautifully-bleak winter's setting to the next, as the people go about their (sometimes pretty shady) business.It's fair to say that Fargo is pretty slow moving. Now, sometimes that comes as a drawback, yet here, it just seems to work. Soon a police officer is on both Jerry and the kidnappers' trail, which brings added heat on everyone concerned. And, in my opinion, this is the film's only drawback. Frances McDormand plays 'Marge,' the local sheriff who starts putting two and two together. It was on about the second viewing of Fargo that I realised what I didn't like about her. She was pregnant. Now, my reason for feeling this way is because Fargo is a pretty dark affair &#x96; you won't know who's going to come a cropper at the hands of a madman at any time. However, it's a brave film-maker who dares to harm a pregnant woman. Now, Marge is clearly the only truly 'good' character &#x96; she's smart, kind, clever and likable, but, being pregnant, you kind of know that nothing bad is going to happen to her. This, for me anyway, took away a little bit of tension from the 'chase.' But, that's just a minor gripe. If you like your crime films slow and bleak then you'll be one of the many who've enjoyed this. The Coen brothers have made plenty of good films since (and a few slightly more forgettable ones), but this one is definitely their finest hour. And, I've managed to come to the end of the review without managing to mention Steve Buscemi &#x96; he's in it too. And, as always, he's great &#x96; just in case you needed an extra reason to watch.

If that's not enough for you, Columbia pictures produced equally poignant DVD features that will really get you fired up along with deleted scenes that you don't want to miss.The movie follows a lot of the important events from the novel and the reenactment from the thespians make it all seem possible by making it all the more to appreciate the work of Jane Austen and why she was one of the great literary geniuses of her time period.Our story commences as we see a dying Henry Dashwood (Tom Wilkinson)with his only son John (James Fleet) situated at his bedside. As he lays dying he offers John his final will to him. He leaves his inheritance to him, while leaving nothing to his second wife (Gemma Jones) and his three daughters Elinor (Emma Thompson), Marianne (Kate Winslet) and Margaret (Emilie Francois). But he did insist that John watch over them and let them live in his inherited abode. However, John is married to a rather overbearing wife named Fanny (Harriet Walter) who eventually convinces John that they can look after themselves. But the women who can't get or inherit, so their only way to get out of their doldrums is to marry rich guys and find true love.Emma Thompson (Golden Globe winner for Best Screenplay) plays the eldest daughter Elinor who's an old maid who can keep her emotions in balance. Meanwhile middle daughter Marianne (Kate Winslet) is quite the polar opposite to Elinor as she is a very emotionally charged teenager who would love to have a man in her life. And the youngest daughter Margaret (Emilie Francois) who is a high-opinionated tomboy who also has a thing for romance.The story drives into full gear when Fanny's brother Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant) enters their down-trodden lives who seems to know about the dilemma these ladies are facing and shows immediate compassion towards them. He becomes like father-figure to little Margaret and has a mutual attraction to eldest daughter, Elinor. While Edward and Elinor are have a proper ways of showing their emotions, Marianne doesn't find him that attractive and she thinks he's stoic. Soon Fanny manipulates Mrs. Dashwood that Elinor only wants to marry Edward over money rather than true love. Eventually he gets called back to London.Eventually, the women get to live in a country cottage which was given to them by their matchmaking relatives. Alan Rickman breaks from type-casting to play a compassionate colonel Brandon who has feeling for the much younger Marianne and seems charmed by musicianship and her melodic voice. but Marianne has no interest in Col. Brandon even though Mrs. Jennings (Elizabeth Spriggs) about all of his good traits. However, Marianne falls head over heels with a young man named Mr. Willoughby (Greg Wise)who literally swept her off her feet after she twisted her ankle in the falling rain. She eventually enjoys Willoughby's company as they go around town on his horse-drawn carriage much to the chagrin of older sister Elinor. Just when Willoughby is about ask Marianne to marry him, he gets sent back to London for an indefinite period of time. While this is happening another lady arrives on the scene. Her name is Lucy Steele (Imogen Stubbs) who tells Elinor that she and Edward has been engaged for five years. Feeling that the Dashwood daughters' romantic lives are hopeless, Mrs. Jennings decides that the ladies should all go to London.When they reach London the climax starts to unfold. What's amazing is that the ladies and the audience are expecting a happy ending as we anticipate secrets within the characters are revealed. The acting is what carries the film the whole way through and as we watch, we feel like we are a part of these characters lives and we feel for them the whole way through.The acting isn't the only thing that makes Sense and Sensibility such an engaging film. Michael Coulter's cinematography was pure eye-candy and the costumes look and feel the time period between 1792 to 1797.

Watching the classic film is so incredibly interesting because almost everyone knows the story of Frankenstein. Being able to see the first film and how it started out is so fascinating. The concept of scary movies had only just begun in this era as companies began to form around the idea of making a movie. The movie portrays a character such as the monster as a misunderstood man who is unable to express what he really means. His groans and sluggish movements really help to create the sense of creepiness. This movie was able to shape the way scary movies would be carried out. There was no soundtrack to this movie which is odd in and of itself. Most people believe that a soundtrack to a horror movie helps build suspense and create tension. The effects in this movie that made it as creepy as it could be would be the monsters grunts and groans as he moved throughout the castle and town.

The concept of scary movies had only just begun in this era as companies began to form around the idea of making a movie. The movie portrays a character such as the monster as a misunderstood man who is unable to express what he really means. His groans and sluggish movements really help to create the sense of creepiness. This movie was able to shape the way scary movies would be carried out. There was no soundtrack to this movie which is odd in and of itself. Most people believe that a soundtrack to a horror movie helps build suspense and create tension.

It's been on my list for years after missing the theatrical release. Finally ordered it from a video store. This is what I would call,, a great movie, in that it is the type of movie where i enjoyed it from start to finish. It has a story and characters, and a good script that all blend together. Kevin Kline was great, and so was the rest of the cast. Although I always wanted to see it because Steve Martin played a serious role. That being said, what really surprised is the definite connection to 2004's Crash with Sandra Bullock. Practically the same movie. They just changed the characters and the incidents that happen. But other than that, Crash is just a remake of this movie. There is also an uncanny resemblance to Steve Martins' L.A. Story Very similar, which was released the same year. All in all a very enjoyable movie.
