It was decades ahead of its time in many ways. It influenced Spielberg, Jackson, you name it; a whole generation of filmmakers. As a kid in pre-Star Wars days, it was breathtaking to watch on TV (a station always showed it every year on Thanksgiving night after Miracle on 34th Street, go figure). Yes, by today's standards, the effects aren't perfect. But HEY! this was about 5 or 6 years after films began talking! Considering it would be some 30 years before effects would come near it, and another 15 or so before they passed it, that is something. Consider today, effects are primarily computerized, and let's not forget, something that looks like a computerized monster is no less fake (something I hope filmmakers figure out, and fast), and that is after 70 years of technological development. And after all that, they are rendered obsolete within a couple years. The fight between Kong and the T-Rex (or allosaurus) can almost stand against effects out there even today. But I digress. I shouldn't have to defend the special effects; those who say they look cheesy need only remember that our greatest triumphs today &#150; of which there are few &#150; will be laughed at years from now just the same. The acting is at times tough, but this was the first generation of talking film actors. They had nobody to learn from. Not to mention that it was the acting style of the day. Some have said the movie was about subtle in-jokes, maybe so. But it remains always a film ride that &#150; unless you are ignorant enough to expect 21st century production values &#150; will take your breath away. The segment from when the men run into the jungle after Kong up to the break after the T-Rex fight is about as breathtaking as you get. As a child, I was almost exhausted by the time that part was done. The atmosphere, the scale of adventure, the scope of story telling all first rate. Also, it so wonderfully blended the mindset of the age with its inspired story telling. It was the last era of innocence before WWII and the modern nuclear age. It was a time when little &#150; though some &#150; of the world was unexplored. A time when industrialization was taking over, and there seemed no limit to what humanity could accomplish, and no price we were not willing to pay. Dinosaurs and tribal witchdoctors, ancient stone walls and forgotten islands. And on the other side the Empire State Building (the ultimate expression of industrial might and ingenuity), airplanes (only around for a decade and a half as weapons &#150; the most 'modern' weapon available), movies (still only a couple decades old for all practical purposes), and New York City, the largest and most advanced city in the world. What contrasts! And all right at hand for the writers. In short, it made its point without having to make it obvious. It will be a long time before there are so many symbols at hand for a new story to fall into place so smoothly. And of course, the iconic image of Kong on the Empire State Building &#150; enough said.One other observation. Note that there isn't much overt morality. Nobody is really 'the bad guy'(and thus deserving of a terrible, gruesome death). The sailors killed are not 'bad' , or made bad for (horror of horrors) suggesting that they shoot at Kong first, or even daring to consider killing a helpless 50 foot gorilla. Carl Denham is not 'bad', the natives on the island are not 'bad', the victims in New York aren't bad, even Kong isn't bad, he's just doing his thing. Everyone is just doing their thing, sometimes good, sometimes bad, but never inherently bad people or animals. Today, of course, you would have the stereotypical lawyer\/corporate exec\/fanatic politician\/religious extremist\/merciless hunter; all who deserve death, because they are 'bad people' because of their ideals or beliefs (the modern acceptable prejudice). Kong would be misunderstood, a victim of horrible western heartlessness or corporate greed, and those who die deserve it for messing with his life and the purity of nature. And the soon-to-be-deceased would meet their deserved demise after a scene demonstrating their evil hearts by doing and\/or saying something blatant to drive the point of their badness home to any that might have missed it. Ah, but the good old days, when a film could actually make you wonder who the bad guy really is, and if there isn't, make you wonder even more about what you have seen and why things had to happen that way.King Kong is considered a classic. It earned it. The remake in the 1970s, flagrant in its moral sermonizing, struggled at best. Who knows, maybe Peter Jackson will navigate modern expectations with the elements of the original to produce a remake worthy of the first without turning it into a floppy CGI based morality play. Let's hope. But in all of its glory or bumbling, whichever the case will prove, let the 2005 remake never overshadow the original and its unique impression it left for generations to come. I give it a 10 only because there is not a higher score to assign.

Ah, but the good old days, when a film could actually make you wonder who the bad guy really is, and if there isn't, make you wonder even more about what you have seen and why things had to happen that way.King Kong is considered a classic. It earned it. The remake in the 1970s, flagrant in its moral sermonizing, struggled at best. Who knows, maybe Peter Jackson will navigate modern expectations with the elements of the original to produce a remake worthy of the first without turning it into a floppy CGI based morality play. Let's hope. But in all of its glory or bumbling, whichever the case will prove, let the 2005 remake never overshadow the original and its unique impression it left for generations to come. I give it a 10 only because there is not a higher score to assign.

Unlike a lot of movies of its kind, the characters were worth caring about - even the minor ones who got killed off early. How scary is it? Well, the friend I saw it with actually jumped out of her seat in one scene, throwing her popcorn all over me in the process. How funny is it? My brother recently quoted Apone at me (I don't know, is there anything you can do?) in the middle of a conversation - and it's been 15 years since he last saw the movie. How dramatic is it? I could name a hundred scenes that gripped me - not just the scary-alien stuff but Ripley's confrontation with the company's people on the space station, her nightmares, even the mood-setting opening scene in which her ship is opened and the dust is swept off her sleeping pod.How satisfying is it? It is absolutely the ONLY movie I've ever seen that actually made me cheer while watching it.

Maybe because it was so absurd and plain ugly. I wanted to see where it could get. Well, it kept being absurd and not making much sense, up until the last minute.Maybe that's what makes this movie (cough) worth seeing. At least the selection of ugly actresses was very well done. Add to that the hideous make-ups, the horrible music and the lack of viewer involvement. The movie looks like filmed theater; the landscape is cut out and out of place, the sky doesn't fit the shadows and so on (the theater of the absurd?) Of course this was deliberate, given the great (or so I've heard...) Fellini, but I don't see the point.Maybe that's the idea - watch this movie to contemplate its pointlessness or your lack of understanding. Or maybe I'm missing a whole lot of somethings.
