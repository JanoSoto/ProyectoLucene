At first, I thought my fears were confirmed, since the first five minutes of the film really does not have that many laughs... but after the first five minutes, I began laugh, and after about fifteen minutes of laughing, my stomach began to hurt, and it really did not stop until the end of the movie. As I write this, I have just gotten home from seeing it, and my stomach is still sore. This is just great comedy. It is one of the most original comedies that I have ever seen. Nothing is really borrowed, and all of the jokes work (well, maybe not all...).Eddie Murphy did a great job of bringing laughs to the screen as the paranoid action star Kit Ramsey and the nerdy fast food worker Jiff. Whenever he played the character Jiff, most people in the theater were almost bawling with laughter. Steve Martin's character, Bowfinger, is less funny, and is more of the straight man, but Martin plays him well also. Then there is Daisy, played by Heather Graham, who sleeps with all the main male characters to get to the top... she does a good job also (she does a lot of great wiggling....). The rest of the actors fulfill their characters well. What surprised me was seeing Terrence Stamp as the leader of a hilarious religious enterprise very similar to Scientology, called MindHead.This movie is great; I have not laughed this hard since I last saw Monty Python's Meaning of Life. I do not think that I have seen a comedy as original as this one for a while. Frank Oz and Steve Martin made a good team at bringing this movie to life. However, I did not laugh at a few scenes. One was a scene with a few racial jokes. Is it just me, or are racial jokes just not funny? Although I admit they are better timed and placed that in Wild Wild West, and in character, but they still made me uncomfortable. The other was a funny scene at first, but after I thought of it, it was not so funny. The scene shows a bunch of Mexicans trying to run for the border while the Border Guards are shooting at them. Bowfinger then herds some of them into his van to use as film crew. That seemed like it trivialized what they go through. However, besides that, Bowfinger is the best comedy of the year. Forget that teen comedy garbage and see this.

I can only be grateful for that occurrence, since this is one of the more compelling films to come along in quite some time. Nothing is given away by my noting that it will, undoubtedly, be compared to MIDNIGHT EXPRESS, a classic re-telling of yet another true story that is a variation on the same harrowing subject. The difference here is really the characters. Namely, two recent high-school girls of privilege who haven't a clue what goes on in the real world. Their journey into that disturbing realization serves as, generally, compelling fodder for dramatic story-telling. As I've said, this isn't the first time we've visited this genre, but its theme is decidedly different and the first-rate performances and script make the trip well worthwhile. Though kudos are in order all around, add this performance to the already impressive repertoire of the luminous Claire Danes, who makes every moment resonate with truth. Always in control as an actor, she opts for unique, informed choices, not only as the character but also in the projects she undertakes. This is not the sort of teen flick a lesser actor with her celebrity would\/should ever attempt. I applaud her restraint and unending good sense, an unfortunate rarity with most persons of her age. Sorry, that's the truth, kids. Even so, I really like the way the screenplay seems to be telling baby boomers not to be so quick to pat themselves on the back for their parenting skills (i.e. - all that baloney about being your child's best friend, UNEARNED self esteem, etc.). Almost in spite of these despicable excuses for parents, their children (at least these two girls) emerge as selfless, mature adults with more compassion than the generation that came before them.If you'd like to be entertained AND engaged by something far more frightening than make-believe witches in the woods, this is the choice for you.

Now you add the liberal left wing radical Hollywood establishment and let them loose on a target hated by the liberal left for so many years that a prescription for disaster is made.No one can believe such a spoof of Nixon and the Watergate scandal can actually be made to seem funny and it is not.The movie is too lightweight,the jokes are too obvious to take seriously(Guess who they will concentrate on?),and the writing and direction is just horrible.   The media ,liberal as it is,hates Nixon so any spoof of him is fine,it has worked before it will work again.The movie is set in the 1970's but has 1990's political correctness as the two heroes here are two teen age girls(Sounds very familar,Buffy Xena,Sabrina,Alex Mack,heroes who are female from men who bend over too much for females for their own good).Kristen Dunst has done better and Michelle Williams could have done better.In the ad photo they look great but in the movie they look smaller than life.   You know if Hoolywood can make a movie about Watergate and Nixon ,how about making a movie about 1960 election,when Nixon ,the true winner of the election,had it stolen from him by a liberal icon John F.Kennedy and his mob friends?How did Kennedy win Illnois after all it would make a great film.How about a movie concerning Clinton and his many scandals,he has had so many in his two terms one could take a pick and make a movie out of it.But don't hold your breath,liberal Hollywood is still too busy making lightweight films filled with sex,drugs,and violence the type of things the movie industry does best.   Quick now for all you teenagers out there,who ran for Vice President with Nixon on the 1960 GOP ticket?Did you say George Washington? I see a lot of teenagers out there nodding their heads saying yes. Thus as you can see Hollywood knows its' audience and knows it well.

I was expecting right wing propaganda, or possibly even (a distant outside chance) left wing propaganda I certainly wasn't expecting THIS. It isn't propaganda at all.  Deriving any kind of message at all from the film is difficult - one might be tempted to conclude that we ought to never trust people who cry cheap political insults like communist! or fascist! or racist! at the first opportunity, but that's just a thought.  At any rate, in order to get a message we have to think about the story for ourselves, very carefully, which makes it the very opposite of propaganda.Here's another bit of advice don't make the mistake, as I did, of thinking now and then that Frankenheimer is drifting from the point.  He knows exactly what he's doing at all times.  Whenever it seems he's offering some interesting diversion from the main story he's really telling the main story by other means.  How good the story is I cannot convey without saying too much.  Probably the central conceit everyone knows already, which was why Frankenheimer was right to spill most of the beans as soon as possible - but he does has one or two in reserve.  One great thing about the story is that it doesn't rely at all on us thinking it likely.Everyone, from composer to cameraman, did a fine job, and the cast does an even finer one.  Angela Lansbury gives the performance of her life.  Frank Sinatra I had never seen in a movie before, and I was surprised to discover that he can act - very well, too.  It permeates down to the minor roles. Leslie Parrish as the charming innocent is certainly charming, but also subtle.  The Manchurian Candidate would easily be the best of its kind even if it weren't the only of its kind.

I actually just watched the original last night on Encore and, personally, found it rather boring for the 40 minutes after the death of Marion Crane.  I mean, nothing really happens except Arbogast getting slashed and falling down the stairs.  Otherwise, there ain't much to it. I'll be the first to admit the film is a classic but I'm not afraid to criticize it simply because it's been touted as the best horror film of all time or because it's Hitchcock.  It's definitely ONE of the best horror films but I wouldn't go so far as the best.  And I, truthfully, had the same problem with the new one.  While I thoroughly enjoyed, that 40 minute period is just straight up boring.I must say that I enjoyed both versions equally and I didn't really see a problem with a remake.  It's just a movie, if you don't like the idea of it, don't watch it.  Simple.Now for some of the aspects and some miscellaneous comments  For those of you out there who are upset about the butt shot after Anne Heche keels over in the shower...it was originally in the 1960 version.  Hitchcock got the shot but never put it in because he knew it would most likely be rejected.  So, all Van Sant did was simply fill in what couldn't be shown 38 years ago.No harm in that.

The only reason it's being so harshly criticized is because people simply can't believe it was remade SHOT-FOR-SHOT (mostly).  So maybe Van Sant shouldn't have done it almost identical to the original.  But I don't see it as a big deal, quite personally.  It's not a masterpiece but (in my opinion) neither was the original.  Hitch made much better movies than this, among them The Birds, Frenzy, Topaz, Rope, etc., etc....this is just another remake in my opinion.

Very few people understand the craft and skill behind it.  Because I can honestly count on two hands the films that scared me, or at least left me filled with tension.

The Haunting has none of that.  The Haunting is filled with lots of loud noises, a non scary entity that shows itself at the end of the film, possessed statues, sheets that move by themselves and every other trick that should make a film like this good.

But what it needs it better camera work, even a little bit of tension and hey, how about a scare or two.  The Haunting contains none of that.  This is one of the biggest disappointments of the summer.  So here is my advice to Jan DeBont.  Whoever directed the trailer, get some pointers from them.  And get Linda Hunt to do some voice over work for the film as well, she had me glued to my seat with anticipation in the trailer ( these are its eyes ).  It's funny too, because Jan De Bont was a DP before he hit it big with Speed.  And one of the films that he was DP for was Cujo.  Now Cujo was a good horror film, not the best, but pretty good.  It's too bad that he couldn't learn from someone even like Lewis Teague, because any effort besides this one would have been better.  This is a disgrace to horror films and even as a film itself it is terrible.  You want to be scared this summer?  Go see Blair Witch and Sixth Sense.  You want to waste two hours?  Go see The Haunting!

In fact, it's downright bad. Sorry, but I'm certain of this.  There are just too many reasons for me to be wrong about all of them.The year of release (1974) marks the start of the Dungeons and Dragons era, and this is the perfect movie to act as its herald.

Sinbad and his crew must search for the golden this to partake in the ceremony of such and such in order to thwart so-and-so; the reasons offered to Sinbad don't strike me as particularly compelling ones, but he sets off without demur nonetheless.  Every so often the dungeon-master will drop him a broad hint.  There's even an oracle who speaks vaguely in verse - can you believe it?So the story isn't so great.  It isn't well presented, either.  I get the distinct impression that Harryhausen is fast-forwarding through the exposition so that he can get to the bit where he does his stop-motion. We have an encounter with the first of the five stop-motion monsters in the very first scene, before we have been properly introduced to the characters - indeed, we are never properly introduced to the characters.  (Note, though, that it IS a sequel.)  This film is really an older version of the special-effects flick, where the story and everything else is just an excuse.  The parallel goes further than you might think.  Consider that first monster.  It is, as it turns out, just a plot device, by which the wizard can magically spy on the heroes.  There was no need for it to have been a stop-motion plot device a crystal ball would have served.  The same goes for some of the later creatures.  One of them is even a humanoid, and could easily have been played by a live actor (and since the interaction between humans and stop-motion figurines is often clumsy, this would have been preferable).  Or consider the animated six-armed statue.  A similar creation actually WAS played by a live actress in The Thief of Bagdad (1940), in a better looking and far more memorable scene.  And just stop yourself a little, in the final confrontation between stop motion creations, and ask yourself if you can with any certainty say what is going on and what has been going on for the last ten minutes or so.  I couldn't.Harryhausen, in an interview, claimed that the stories of Sinbad and Greek myth have far more warmth than, say, Norse myths, and I know exactly what he means.  The Mediterranean sunlight makes this seem like a holiday of some kind - a holiday to a cultured as well as an exotic land, for The Arabian Nights and Greek myths are sophisticated fictions by highly cultured civilisations.  I'm just trying to understand what charm people see in this movie, because I still think the execution fails miserably.  Maybe another source of charm is the women.  Here we get to see a gorgeous, busty Caroline Munro, although we don't get to see very much of her - either of her body or of her character.  If it's the women you're after then check out the next in the series, Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger (1977), which has Taryn Power AND Jane Seymour, both of whom at least play some reasonably prominent role in the story AND display considerably more flesh.

Obviously the filmmakers have put more time into choosing the actors to play the characters than actually developing them. But even then if you have a free ticket or are at the multiplex during discount hours, you minds well take the time to see this film, but only expect a cheap laugh or two.The plot is a Batman rip-off with the spirited heart of The Monster Squad. It opens giving us three wannabe superheros, The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria), who can throw forks really well, The Shoveler, (William H. Macy) who has the gift of digging extremely fast and accurately with shovels, and Mr. Furious, (Ben Stiller) who relies on his red hot temper to give him extraordinary man power. And then there's the cities most beloved crime fighter, Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear), who not only works independently, but also has nothing to do with any other helper or fan of his in the city.When Captain Amazing discovers that he has no crime to fight because his talent is so effective, he decides to arrange the release of arch enemy currently being held in a high security prison; Cassanova Frankenstein (played effectively by Geoffrey Rush). When set free, however, Frankenstein arranges the capture and eventual disposal of his foe, Amazing, and leaves the city to be destroyed by evil and darkness when his plan dealing with a laser gun is put into focus.Who will save the city from depravity? The three who were once unheard of jokes soon bring together a team of crime fighters with super powers of their own The Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), who seeks revenge on one of Cassanova Frankenstein's henchmen who still lives in the 70's disco era for her fathers death, Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell of Good Burger), who thinks he can turn invisible when no one is watching him, The Spleen (Paul Reubens) a disgusting male who can pass extremely nasty smelling gas when someone pulls on his fore finger, and finally The Sphinx (Wes Studi) who is the team's mysterious and wise leader.Mystery Men has several good qualities.

The film's production design looks like something out of a Batman movie that makes a city look immense and grand, at the same time week and inefficient. The designers create a vast, atmospheric mood throughout the film, releasing a sense of adventure and sometimes excitement. The great cast makes the movie, one with the level of accuracy of 200 Cigarettes and Ed TV. The performances were also quite the treat. It is a pleasure just perceiving these big names on the screen together.The problem comes from the severe lacking of character, mood and story development. The movie begins with a senseless action scene, never introducing any of its characters to us. The plot then jumps to problems before we have knowledge of the setting where these events are actually taking place. Even at the non-spectacular ending we have trouble understanding some of the character's action to each other, mostly because we know so little about them. I do realize this production is intended to be a comedy, and some of it is funny, but do the characters have to know so little?Kinka Usher's direction here will remain a mystery.

","genre":"Action, Comedy, Fantasy"},{"date":"14 August 1999","score":"","review":" Director Kinka Usher   111minutes    Rated PG-13 (for comic action violence and some crude humor)To like a movie with as much smarts as Mystery Men, one would have to be equally as intelligent. That is not saying a whole lot. Mystery Men has one of the most underdeveloped screenplays in film history, yet at the same time manages in indulge in several very funny moments, all coming from the film's oddly acted, wonderfully portrayed characters. Obviously the filmmakers have put more time into choosing the actors to play the characters than actually developing them. But even then if you have a free ticket or are at the multiplex during discount hours, you minds well take the time to see this film, but only expect a cheap laugh or two.The plot is a Batman rip-off with the spirited heart of The Monster Squad. It opens giving us three wannabe superheros, The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria), who can throw forks really well, The Shoveler, (William H. Macy) who has the gift of digging extremely fast and accurately with shovels, and Mr. Furious, (Ben Stiller) who relies on his red hot temper to give him extraordinary man power. And then there's the cities most beloved crime fighter, Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear), who not only works independently, but also has nothing to do with any other helper or fan of his in the city.When Captain Amazing discovers that he has no crime to fight because his talent is so effective, he decides to arrange the release of arch enemy currently being held in a high security prison; Cassanova Frankenstein (played effectively by Geoffrey Rush). When set free, however, Frankenstein arranges the capture and eventual disposal of his foe, Amazing, and leaves the city to be destroyed by evil and darkness when his plan dealing with a laser gun is put into focus.Who will save the city from depravity? The three who were once unheard of jokes soon bring together a team of crime fighters with super powers of their own The Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), who seeks revenge on one of Cassanova Frankenstein's henchmen who still lives in the 70's disco era for her fathers death, Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell of Good Burger), who thinks he can turn invisible when no one is watching him, The Spleen (Paul Reubens) a disgusting male who can pass extremely nasty smelling gas when someone pulls on his fore finger, and finally The Sphinx (Wes Studi) who is the team's mysterious and wise leader.Mystery Men has several good qualities. For instance, It has a message and a point to it. The film's production design looks like something out of a Batman movie that makes a city look immense and grand, at the same time week and inefficient. The designers create a vast, atmospheric mood throughout the film, releasing a sense of adventure and sometimes excitement. The great cast makes the movie, one with the level of accuracy of 200 Cigarettes and Ed TV. The performances were also quite the treat. It is a pleasure just perceiving these big names on the screen together.The problem comes from the severe lacking of character, mood and story development. The movie begins with a senseless action scene, never introducing any of its characters to us. The plot then jumps to problems before we have knowledge of the setting where these events are actually taking place. Even at the non-spectacular ending we have trouble understanding some of the character's action to each other, mostly because we know so little about them. I do realize this production is intended to be a comedy, and some of it is funny, but do the characters have to know so little?Kinka Usher's direction here will remain a mystery.
