[{"date":"18 May 2009","score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Having seen this original all those decades ago, and recalling little if anything of it, other than Laughton's Puckish performance, after all, the observer who noted that Gable was Gable uttered a no-brainer. That said, what bemuses this still-breathing, if barely, onlooker is the hoohah over subsequent versions of the yarn. Especially that of the Brando retake. Sight unseen, Brando at the very least had to be one take closer to an acting performance than Gable, who was, well, just one more of those over-hyped Gollywood dreamboats of yore. Yes, he was rather charming vis-a-vis Claudette in that Columbia throwaway, It Happened One Night? But, for all his excesses of baggage AND Group Theater mumblings, Brando should be excoriated for his disrespect of Milestone, even as he may be excused for his pant-ripping appetites. He too was, simply, like James Dean as well, just one more overblown staple of the Hollywood mills that ground exceeding fine, chiefly in the perceptions, not to mention the ratings and rankings, of generations to come. I count myself among those few who found Brando's bellowings in Streetcar less than convincing, and his motorbikings not all that much more persuasive. He did, finally, achieve a degree of dignity as the Don in The Godfather, but that is as much due to the casting as it was to the portrayal. Brando, like Gable and Dean, was a paean to the promotions of the Hollywood fraternity of praise singers, apologies to the author of The Charioteer. That millions, both in dollars and in the audience, continue to pay serious homage is a tribute to the efficacy of the entertainment Machiavellis and Tsun-tzus and Goebbelses. Consider who is not convinced that both Gone with the Afflatus and that shameless Titanic are both classic cinema? Well, so they are, as popcorn merchants. But as works of art? Finally, again, sight unseen, the Brit Bounty with its weighty cast, would HAVE to be an improvement on BOTH Yankee versions. And, as an irreverent, yet one more, observation?, I find it rich that Richard Harris found Brando er, ah, overripe.
