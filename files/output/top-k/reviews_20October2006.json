The action takes place in the early seventies, a time when the city was an essential stop on the hippie trail, largely because of the easy availability of drugs. (It was doubtless this reputation that was responsible for the Crosby Stills and Nash hit Marrakesh Express, the railway systems of North Africa not normally being regarded as a major source of inspiration for songwriters).There were, however, some in the hippie community whose interest in the city was less pharmaceutical than spiritual, this being a period of great interest in alternative forms of religion. Just as some young Westerners travelled to India or the Far East to sit at the feet of a guru, so Julia, the main character in the film, has been drawn to Morocco by her interest in the mystical Islamic Sufi tradition. She is a young Englishwoman who has travelled to Marrakesh with her two young daughters Bea and Lucy. She has formed a relationship with a young Moroccan, but has no job, and her only sources of income are the maintenance cheques she receives at irregular intervals from the estranged boyfriend who is the father of her children.The film has two strengths. One is its vivid photography, which well captures the brilliant light and colours of Marrakesh (a fascinating if exhausting place to visit). The other is the charm and naturalness of the two young actresses who play Bea and Lucy. The two girls are carefully distinguished; Lucy is happy with her life in Morocco, whereas Bea, the elder, wants nothing more than to return to a normal life in London. (The odd title Hideous Kinky is a meaningless phrase invented by the two girls as part of a children's game).The film does not, however, have much else going for it. Morocco seems to have a strange effect on European filmmakers; I was reminded of Bernardo Bertolucci's The Sheltering Sky, another beautifully photographed but lifeless film set in the same country. Hideous Kinky is not quite as bad as Bertolucci's mammoth epic of tedium (for a start it is considerably shorter), but it is still dull and uninteresting. One reviewer describes it as refreshingly free of a rigorous story line, which he evidently intended as praise but which struck me as a euphemism for having nowhere to go and nothing to say. Kate Winslet could do little with the character of Julia, who came across as a rather unattractive personality. It is ironical that someone so intent on the annihilation of the ego (the goal of Sufism) should be so egotistical; she is so obsessed with her own spiritual journey that she neglects her children. The film, however, misses the opportunity to explore the ironies and contradictions in the hippie shopping-cart attitude to religion.Following the immense success of Titanic, Winslet was in the enviable position of being able to choose just about any role she wanted. A small-scale, low-budget European art film like Hideous Kinky was therefore a strange career move, but doubtless Winslet wanted to prove to the world and to herself that, despite having played the leading role in a huge blockbuster, she was still a quirky free spirit. (Another egotistical way of annihilating one's ego?) Watching the film, however, I was reminded of that quote from Ken Loach's Poor Cow, immortalising a dull West London suburb- When Tom was in work the world was our oyster.

When Carla is edged out of an important contract she was negotiating by a slimy colleague she exploits Paul's criminality by having him steal the contract back. The colleague quickly realises that she's behind the robbery, but when he confronts her, Paul's readiness to punch people in the face comes in handy too - but this thuggery comes at a price. Paul is given a 'going over' by some mob acquaintances as a reminder about an unpaid debt. He formulates a plan which utilises Carla's unique lip reading abilities to rip-off a gang of violent bank robbers. It's now Carla's turn to enter a frightening new world.The fourth feature from director Jacques Audiard, 'READ MY LIPS' begins as a thoroughly engaging romantic drama between two marginalised losers only to shift gears halfway through into an edgy thriller where their symbiotic shortcomings turn them into winners. The leads are excellent; effortlessly convincing us that this odd couple could really connect. Carla's first meeting with Paul is an enjoyable farce in which she attempts to circumnavigate his surly reticence and jailbird manners only to discover that he was, until very recently, a jailbird.

Vincent Cassel plays Paul as a cornered dog who only really seems at home when he's receiving a beating or concocting the rip-off that is likely to get him killed.Like many French films, 'READ MY LIPS' appears, at first, to be about nothing in particular until you scratch beneath the surface and find that it's probably about everything. The only bum note is a subplot concerning the missing wife of Paul's parole officer; a device that seems contrived only to help steer the main thrust of the story into a neat little feelgood cul-de-sac.It was the French 'New Wave' of the 60's that first introduced the concept of 'genre' to film making and I've always felt that any medium is somewhat compromised when you have to use a system of labels to help define it; so it's always a pleasure to discover a film that seems to transcend genre, or better still, defy it.

In the crucial opening scenes, the film should assert itself and make the viewers take notice and get interested in the rest of the film. Here, in Mute Witness, we find a prime example of this.*Scene spoiler* In the first 5-10 minutes, the film opens to a very Hitchcockian scene of a pretty blonde lady in her apartment, with the radio on. She's wandering around, applying lipstick, dolling herself up, and ignoring the news report of a serial killer on the loose. Of course, the serial killer is in her house, and monitoring her moves, knife in hand. She hears a noise, looks in a room, and there is her partner in a pool of blood. At the very point of her screams, she turns around to be faced with the knife-wielding maniac, who stabs her repeatedly in a brutal and horrifying act.......then something odd happens. As the woman convulses in her death throes, the killer sits down and takes out a cigarette to watch his victim perish. Before he finds his lighter, his cigarette is lit...from someone else in the room! The camera pans out, and we realise that there are more and more people in the room, some taking notes, some filming, some recording the death, and that the lady is taking an awfully long time to die, and making a very hammy job of it too. When the audience realises what's going on, and the whole scene is part of a film, the suspenseful and horrific scene takes on an element of humour.*End Scene Spoiler* I have highlighted this opening scene for several reasons. Firstly, it portrays the atmosphere of the whole movie perfectly. A thriller in the style of Hitchcock or De Palma, with some very disorientating, and even blackly humorous moments. - It conveys a central subject matter (that of the difference between a 'movie screen death' and a 'snuff film death', an issue which is elaborated on later in the film), and finally, it introduces the viewer to the characters, all as silently as possible.The plot of Mute Witness centres around Billy Hughes, an American special effects make-up artist who is working on the set of the film, being shot in a large warehouse in Moscow. Billy cannot speak, but she communicates in sign language through her sister. After the end of an evening's filming, Billy inadvertently finds herself locked in the warehouse by accident, and in her attempt to escape, is witness to two of the crew making what first appears to be a porno film, but turns out to be a snuff movie. Suddenly, her escape from the warehouse is a matter of life and death.Without doubt, the first half of the film is powerful and absolutely gripping. Billy's saving grace, and her handicap is the fact that she isn't able to utter a sound. (In fact, in my opinion, one of the best aspects of the film is the fact that it isn't chock-full of women screaming). There are some utterly disturbing moments, and some superb set-pieces of real suspense (The corridoor, and the elevator shaft are perfect examples). The timing is fluid, and the whole first half is an incredibly satisfying experience in itself.The second half of the film introduces new concepts. While there are still several suspenseful moments, the focus is on plot twists. New characters are introduced, and it is ambiguous as to whose side they are on. While there is nothing wrong per se with the second half of the film, it just doesn't quite measure up to the first half. There are some neat moments of black humour that perfectly juxtapose and punctuate some very dramatic scenes, but there are also some very lame comedy moments (coming specifically from Billy's sister and her fiancée, who happens to be the director of the movie Billy is working on), that almost ruin the film, just because they are badly misplaced and\/or mistimed and ruin the pace. - At the end, the twists keep coming at a rapid-fire speed, and the climax of the film is, appropriately, as tense as the first half.There are several things that really make the movie work. The barriers of communication that Billy must face, both as a mute, and as an American in Moscow, mean that even an emergency call for help becomes a dangerous situation. The actress that plays Billy, Natasha Zudina, does a wonderful job in the film, with an engaging on-screen prescence, and a brilliant performance, and finally, the direction as a whole, but most particularly in the first half of the film, which truly is a study in Alfred Hitchcock's suspense\/thriller film techniques.As I have already said, though, the let-downs in the film are from some terrible comic relief moments that really do not need to be added. There is already a consistent and effective streak of dark humour that appears in the film without the need for the characters of Karen Hughes and Andy Clarke (The sister and the moviemaker) to turn their scenes into some unusual sit-com. However, despite these shortcomings, the film is a thoroughly enjoyable thriller, and ideal for a group viewing at halloween. (Certainly better than the usual slasher horror film...!)

Charm and class and charisma and comic timing. Color and culture. It is the perfect romance set in a perfect frame and the irony of how painful life and love can be makes it bittersweet yet tasty. Just like the song.The reason I believe Sleepless in Seattle was such a hit was that it was as if Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks were the children of Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr, walking where their parents had walked, loving as their parents had loved and finding in a new generation that true love really does conquer all the world, the flesh and the devil can throw at us.Maybe it's because I still pray, in my quiet manly way, as Grant does while watching Kerr in the chapel, to find such a love. But to think of such things while watching such a movie is another guilty pleasure.So if you get your man to watch this movie with you, ladies, don't mind if he snarls at it or squawks or teases.

Based on the director's own novel LEGION it should be noted as proving quite influential on many successful serial killer thrillers that followed after 1990, especially in my view SE7EN. Much of the Gemini killers gruesome modus operandi appears to have inspired a lot of John Doe's handy work in Andrew Kevin Walker's 1995 thriller. For example, witness the discovery and aftermath of Father Dyer's hospital bedside murder. The clinical and thorough procedure carried out by the Gemini killer here bears a stark resemblance to various scenes in SE7EN. And again in this scene, the discovery of It's A Wonderful Life on the wall has echoes of similar discoveries by the detectives in SE7EN. This is not a criticism of that later film though, far from it. It just merely emphasises what a shame it was that William Peter Blatty's film was so ignored simply for being slightly ahead of it's time. Both films remain thoroughly well acted and entertaining thrillers and truth be told SE7EN is the overall better film given it's brilliant climax, an area where EXORCIST III fails somewhat. As many have noted it appears the producers tacked on the exorcism scene, it certainly plays and feels that way. However, the concluding minutes of the film do deliver some nice shocks. The catatonic nurse certainly knows how to liven up a house visit.For me this film succeeds in it's brilliantly paced set pieces and not so much in it's sum parts. The scenes with George C. Scott and Ed Flanders are superbly played as are Scott's encounters with Nancy Fish's Nurse Allerton. The atmosphere, in no small way aided by the Georgetown setting, is suitably eerie as was very much the case in the original film THE EXORCIST. This is heightened early on in the confessional scene where we are privy to an unseen strangers confession to the serial killings. All we see here are interior shots of the confessional booth but on the priests side only. It's the chilling dialogue from the other side that drives the scene.The much talked about corridor scene during the nurse's night shift is a master class in suspense and spine tingling shock play. You never forget the first time you watch that scene. Even on repeated viewings, you know what's coming but the pay off hit's the button every time. It makes Ben Gardiner's eye popping head shock in Jaws seem like child's play and far more effective than the modern trend in horror films today of stabbing a orchestral hit to punctuate a false shock every few minutes. In fact there is little score in this film and many scenes feature periods of total silence. This perhaps is a technique Blatty picked up from Friedkin's directorship of the 1973 original. That film also benefited from sharp juxtapositions of sound against periods of silence. Certainly, given the expertise these sort of tricks are employed with, it's a shame Blatty hasn't directed more.Mention should also go to Brad Dourif whose scenes with Scott are engaging. Jason Miller's brief appearances are also good, again posing the question why he didn't show up in other good roles after the original film? As I say, the obviously bolted on exorcism scenes only serve to disappoint shifting what could have been an excellent thriller into a no man's land of horror hokum. As it is I rate THE EXORCIST III as very good example of a well acted suspense thriller that undoubtedly influenced other film makers and writers.

As this movie's release date approached, I felt shamed into doing it. The first attempt was not encouraging. The prologue launches into an explanation of the differences between the three types of Hobbits, for heaven's sake! Was this really necessary? I'll read The Hobbit, I thought. Maybe that'll help, and after all, it is the start of the story. This lightly taken decision changed my life. Suddenly I was in Tolkien's brilliantly realised world. This saga of the Ring is very simply the veritable mother lode of stories, from the first comical meeting in The Hobbit between the naive, totally unsuspecting Bilbo, and the canny, worldly wise Gandalf, until LotR's final concluding moment when Samwise Gamgee returns home to his family, with his heroic life behind him and another, just as full, in front. I was now concerned that the movies would not live up to Tolkien's writings, but I need not have worried. After first seeing The Fellowship of the Ring, I felt inspired and exhilarated by this triumph of movie-making, so good in every detail. The two Ians, as Bilbo and Gandalf, launch the tale perfectly, with a powerful meeting of hearts, minds and wills. The movie's pacing is ideal, with Tolkien's meandering opening chapters distilled into a tension filled embarking of the hobbits' epic journey. Christopher Lee is magnificent as the evil Sarumann, Viggo Mortensen flawlessly portrays the mysterious Strider, and the unfairly criticised Liv Tyler is totally convincing as the brave, beautiful Arwen. Peter Jackson's direction is simply brilliant throughout the whole movie. For example, The Council of Elrond scene is wonderfully balanced and nuanced, showing off Jackson's self-assured willingness to take risks. The stirring moment when the Fellowship is formed is immediately cheekily undermined by Pippin's ridiculous question.The criticism that the movie is too episodic, or even worse, a mere road movie, is rather ill-informed. After, Tolkien wrote it this way, and the story should follow the original narrative very closely until the overall scenario and the characters within the Fellowship are established going into The Two Towers. Besides, the overall thrust of the story is so compelling that Hollywood-style convention is not even a consideration. When the Fellowship hits the road the movie really kicks into gear. Sean Bean brings his powerful presence to the screen, which with the arrival of Cate Blanchett's Galadriel helps the movie compensate for the loss of Ian McKellen once Gandalf takes his famous dive into depths of the dwarf mine of Moria.It is in Moria, of course, that the ever increasing tension finally explodes into breathlessly exciting action sequences. This extended sequence is the pivot of the whole movie, with Ian McKellen gently implying to Frodo that he, Gandalf, may have to die to ensure the Quest's survival, before all hell breaks loose. Jackson, aided by Howard Shore's excellent score, takes us on a tremendous emotional roller-coaster which culminates with the unforgettable scene of the Fellowship sprawled on sun-bleached rocks bitterly grieving Gandalf's apparent death. Epic movie making simply does not get any better than this.The following interlude in Lothlorien is a potentially awkward, because the Elves are very hard characters to portray convincingly. How can a young, beautiful woman like Cate Blanchett pretend to be unmeasured thousands of years old? At first, I was not convinced by her very slow, mannered speech, but by the end of the Mirror of Galadriel scene I felt the essence of the character had been conveyed, with incomprehensible power, yet also compassion for Frodo. Elijah Wood does some of his best work in the whole trilogy in this part of FotR, effectively conveying Frodo's quiet determination to see through the Quest in the face of more and more terrifying odds.Far too often, a movie of exceptional quality for most of its length ends with a whimper, not a bang. In the case of FotR, this was never a risk, due to Jackson's commitment to putting Tolkien's story onto the screen without compromising its integrity. We are transfixed by the horror and confusion of the Uruk-hai attack at Parth Galen while the Fellowship is broken. Viggo Mortensen truly comes into his own here, showing truly kingly qualities during the fight scenes, then when he farewells Frodo, comforts the dying Boromir, and charges Legolas and Gimli to join his pursuit of the Uruks. Sean Bean is simply unforgettable, and Sean Astin is excellent in foreshadowing Sam's total devotion to his master during the rest of the story. Nearly everyone I spoke to about the film shared the same feeling, which was hard it was to contemplate a year's wait before we could all enjoy The Two Towers!Some comments about the Extended Edition are appropriate because those who have not read the books may doubt the need for it. The EE is a more uncompromised vision of FotR, which adds some of the richness of Tolkien's incredibly detailed books. After the original prologue Jackson adds Bilbo's hilarious introduction to the world of Hobbits, and a later there are two added scenes which add depth to Sam's character, mentioning his crush on Rosie and his desire to know more about the mysterious world of the Elves. The added mystery of the man Strider's origins and relationship to the Elves is also delved into with two more new scenes, on the road from Bree, and in Rivendell itself. Many of the existing scenes are extended, adding greatly to plot and character development. The Council of Elrond scene now adds greatly to the menace of the Ring. Personally, I love the way the extended scenes enrich Aragorn's and Boromir's complicated relationship of mutual respect yet also mistrust concerning the Ring.

Very difficult to criticise, it truly is a gem for all gangster film lovers. Robert De Niro was masterful not even Pacino,Brando,Nicholson could have portrayed the character of Jimmy Conway as well in my opinion. The intensity and just utter brilliance that De Niro's ability brings to the character dose not allow you to look away from him. Few actors have that ability in my opinion, Brando and Pacino are two who do and who would have struggled to match De Niro. De Niro was supported well to say the least with great performances by Joe Pesci, Ray Liotta and Paul Sorvino. Every time you watch this film you see something different and it reminds you that this film is a masterpiece. Martin Scorsese had truly excelled himself in this film, he's created a benchmark for all future gangster films and to this day nothing has come moderately close. it amazes me how this film never won Best Picture at the Oscars.

Well it has Will Smith in it. Need I say more? Will Smith made that movie a splash hit, with a lot of help from his Co Stars of course! Every single movie that Will Smith has made I have seen. The movies have great story lines, great plots, but Will just puts the icing on the cake for every movie he does. He adds a sense of real life to every movie he makes, and every girl swoons if they see he has a new movie out. I will be walking back to class and see lockers and lockers full of Will Smiths pictures! I see binders and binders filled with his pictures. He makes movies big hits. Every movie he does, never goes down the drain, and is one of those classic movies over and over again. I hope that he stays in movie business for a very long time. My teacher was one of the marines in the beginning of the movie, he said Will was like a normal guy. He was a excellent actor, remember everything, but a normal guy. He even played with Will's son. He's not one of those snotty actors living in billion dollar mansions, but a real guy. Some people don't like him, say he should stick to singing or playing small roles in tiny episodes. Well those people are idiots. He definitely is a great singer and absolutely, he he is a great actor. If they learn to see what I see then they will realize at last that Will Smith has got great potential and talent. I know he has been in tons of movies. But he could triple that by ten. I hope he never stops. Even in his old age he will be funny and make people grabbing there sides not to laugh. I just love Will Smith and hope on one day actually being able to meet him and tell him what a great idol he has been for me. If he can come up from the hood, and become rich and famous. A geeky girl from a small hick school could become a singer, or a actress. But only will I dream. LOL.

At the height of the popularity of Bart Simpson, Disney released another adaptation of the classic starring a new up-and-coming child actor named Elijah Wood as Huck and a Yale graduate named Courtney B. Vance as Jim. But wait! The stars just keep on coming; Back-to-back Oscar-winner Jason Robards as the King, pre-Harry Potterized Robbie Coltrane as the Duke, Ron Hellboy Perlman (I could've sworn it was Tom Waits!) as Huck's drunk pappy, and Anne Heche (still hiding her cuckoo) as Mary Jane Wilks. There are also cameos by Six Feet Under's Frances Conroy, Curtis Booger Armstrong, and Pete's younger brother Pete Danny Tamberelli. There are quite a few dark moments for this PG-rated film, but maybe that's a big part of why I support it; Huck's gun-wielding confrontation with his father happens to be my favorite scene, though it's certainly not the darkest (That would be Billy's big scene.). The end of the movie is quite different from the end of the book - of course, they took the happily-ever-after approach - which sucks and ultimately makes a film filled with beautiful scenery and an unbelievably terrific score by Bill Conti seem like just another piece of Disnefluff. I know a bad ending can slay an entire movie, but one can't deny there's some good stuff in this one.
