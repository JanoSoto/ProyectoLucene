He doesn't like his work and gets no sense of reward from it, attempting instead to drown his sorrows by putting together the perfect apartment. He can't sleep and feels alienated from the world at large; he's become so desperate to relate to others that he's taken to visiting support groups for patients with terminal diseases so that he'll have people to talk to. One day on a business flight, he discovers Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charming iconoclast who sells soap. Tyler doesn't put much stock in the materialistic world, and he believes that one can learn a great deal through pain, misfortune, and chaos. Tyler cheerfully challenges his new friend to a fight. Our Narrator finds that bare-knuckle brawling makes him feel more alive than he has in years, and soon the two become friends and roommates, meeting informally to fight once a week. As more men join in, the fight club becomes an underground sensation, even though it's a closely guarded secret among the participants. (First rule Don't talk about fight club.

But as our Narrator and Tyler bond through violence, a strange situation becomes more complicated when Tyler becomes involved with Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), whom our Narrator became infatuated with when they were both crashing the support-group circuit.

My attempt here is to give my thoughts on some of Alfred Hitchcock's decisions in making this early 1970s film, and why they were good or not.The innocent-man-on-the-run is a good concept, as proved by earlier Hitchcock films. The mistake in Frenzy is the protagonist is not shown to be a likable man in any way. Right after an opening scene where a naked body is found in the Thames River in London, we see Richard being fired from his job as a bartender when he is spotted drinking some of the boss's product. He insisted he was going to pay for it, that he always does. The boss explains, Whether stealing or drinking (on the job), I can't use him. (paraphrasing).Then we see Richard visiting a lonely hearts club office, which his ex-wife operates. He is somewhat rude to the receptionist, and then is rather nasty to the ex-wife, for no reason we can see. She invites him to supper and secretly slips some money into his pocket.I think the film is somewhat sloppy in that it appears that Richard has to spend the first night after he is fired in a Salvation Army center. I think very few men who hold jobs are put out of their living quarters the very day they are fired from their jobs. There was no mention of him being about to be evicted without being fired, so his immediate homeless condition seemed wrong.He finds the money, about $50, and immediately decides to live it up at a fancy hotel, taking his girlfriend barmaid to spend the night with him. I again had trouble understanding this suddenly homeless fellow who just lost his job, showing no interest in even looking for other work or a cheap place to stay, but throwing away the few pounds he has on a fancy hotel.(Spoiler alert) Meanwhile, that fruit-market friend of Richard's, named Robert, shows up at the lonely hearts club the next day while the receptionist is out to lunch. His talk soon turns a bit scary for her. She tries to humor him, saying she will meet him somewhere later, but he grabs her and we see a prolonged, uncomfortable rape scene, climaxed by him killing her with his necktie.I have read that Hitchcock followed the scene depicted in the book upon which this movie was based, only that the book was more graphic and disturbing.I believe movie directors in general are always figuring that their film needs to go farther than earlier films. This applies to any kind of violent scene, love scene, whatever. They figure this scene won't seem intense if the viewers can remember a film from a couple of years ago that was similar but was more intense. Hitchcock figured Frenzy had to have us see a more disturbing murder than the first one in Psycho. The reasoning is similar to why amusement parks keep building roller coasters higher and faster.In a similar way, movies through the decades have delighted in showing more and more of the female anatomy, to attract the interest of male viewers. By the time this film was made, you could actually show things in films that were totally not allowed in regular films a few years before. The titillating, voyeurism is the only reason I can find to explain why Hitchcock let us see Richard's girlfriend get up from the bed and head for the other room while totally naked. It would have been simple to have her grab a robe or towel or just have the camera not show all that it did, and have the same scene.Later, at the second killing, we see nothing of the killing, we just figure it happens while the camera backs away from the place, down the stairs and out the door. Here Hitchcock shrewdly knows that scenes left to the viewers' imagination can be highly dramatic and gripping.Richard is betrayed by Robert and arrested, immediately figuring out that Robert must be the killer. Here is where I had the biggest trouble with the film. We never see any scenes of Richard explaining his innocence to the police. He immediately figures it has to be Robert, but we don't know what he told the police. You would think that some of these murders would have been committed while Richard was bar-tending and that would make the detective quite doubtful of Richard being the guy. Just the fact that the one murder they figured they could pin on him was his ex-wife in her office, one day after he was seen there, would seem to be obvious that he wouldn't have killed her there, if anywhere. He would be a logical suspect to begin with. Too easy.Instead we hear he is convicted and the climax comes right as he is about to get revenge on Robert.What we needed to make this a better movie was some reason to like Richard. We needed to see him going about trying to get proof that Robert was the killer, like in Hitchcock's better films about the innocent man on the run. Instead, he has no chance of doing this, and only tries to kill him in revenge.I think Hitchcock missed the essential elements that made Young and Innocent, Saboteur, The Wrong Man and North by Northwest such great films. There were some neat camera shots and I liked the poor detective with his gourmet wife, but the story missed the key scenes and the character we were supposed to care about, was not a nice guy at all.We see Babs getting into a big argument with her boss at the pub.

Maybe time has taken its toll on the viewing experience of Sluizer's movie, because when I rented and watched it last night, I was not very impressed. The premise of the movie is still interesting enough and, although a little rough around the edges, the cinematography and direction is well crafted.The story of a man who becomes obsessed with uncovering what happened to his girlfriend after she vanished from a gas station three years ago is told effectively and uses a goal driven narrative to makes the viewer identify with the protagonist. Just as Rex becomes more and more determined to find out what happened, while the loving feelings for the girl are long gone, so are we. The kidnapper taunts Rex and the audience by promising answers but only if we let him stay in control. But ultimately I found the movie terribly flawed through major plot holes and was left a bit baffled by the amazing ratings it got. If Rex kept getting post cards and letters from the kidnapper, why did he not go to the police and shared those messages? Surely that would have helped hunting down the bad guy. And swallowing the sleeping pill is, hands down, one of the craziest, stupidest things I've ever seen in a scary movie. Especially since the kidnapper keeps phrasing his promises of revelation as if he was going to kill Rex. I understand Rex's obsession, but at this point the movie lost me and I detached myself from the protagonist. And last but not least The bad guy gets away with burying Rex alive. How insane is that? He drove through three countries with the guy in the car, passed two borders, had stopovers and was even stopped by a police car. And after Rex goes missing nobody has a clue where he went? Having the movie end on that note was a total let-down. It's especially disappointing because the movie refrained from giving the audience a happy ending, which is rare and should be encouraged.

The director, Billy Wilder, has opened it up a bit to show the assembly area in the middle of a dismal continental winter in Germany but most of the action takes place inside Barracks Four, where about two dozen Air Force sergeants are kept as POWs.William Holden gets the lead and is the pivotal figure but it's really an ensemble movie with memorable characters and some equally impressive scenes. It may seem a bit hokey now but when it ran on Broadway in 1951 and 1952, the war was only a few years behind us and still fresh in our memories, so what seems stilted now was news at the time.Among the two dozen inmates of Barracks Four, Holden is the odd man out, a wheeler and dealer with a treasure chest of wine, cigarettes, silk stockings, and other delicacies. The sociologist, Erving Goffman, described such places as total institutions in which life was regimented. Part of any functioning total institution was what he called the small reward system.

In fact, more than the film's characterizing food, Lasse Hallström's Chocolat symbolizes these little pleasures and delights that, once you taste them, make you inevitably wonder if it's worth troubling over the mightier matters of life especially when it's governed by the rigid hand of morality, when succumbing to the temptation or luring people into it, become a difficult, even perilous, mission.Chocolat is set in a French village with an unmemorable name, one of these 'once upon a time' old-fashioned little places, whose people live according to tacit rules and codes that remained unperturbed for centuries. It's a village à la Frank Capra with a mayor, a priest, a grouchy lady, an old mourning widow, a lonely man walking across the street with his dog, a mad woman who hides a concealed wound in her heart, and so one and so forth. And the village's austere and apparently sinister stagnancy only calls for a stranger to break the morbid routine. Her name is Vianne Rocher, and the village, naturally, will never be the same after her arrival.I wonder how the producers were convinced to make a film that exploits so many of the usual archetypes that nourished our classic knowledge, in a world that got so eagerly sucked into the progresses of technology, action and fast-paced thrillers. Indeed, when fairytale and sentimentality mostly belong to animation, Chocolat's presence feels as awkward as Vianne's in the village. They probably thought that it's today's very audience that would need that kind of nostalgic escapism or that the film would never fail to touch the hearts, because the heroine is portrayed by Juliette Binoche. And yes, as Vianne Rocher, Binoche is the secret ingredient that gives the film its delicious flavor.Only Binoche could carry the perfect mixture of alluring tenderness and enigmatic confidence, she's not just the typical 'cute shop owner', she's the embodiment of that sly wind blowing from the North, like a fresh air about to dust off the village's preconceived ideas, and undermine the dominance of mayor Comte de Reynaud, played by Alfred Molina. His antagonism with Vianne starts with her inconvenient timing; she opens a chocolate shop during the Lent, much more at Sunday hours. His invitation (more like a polite coercion) to join the church forces her to reveal that she's not religious, not married, which makes the existence of her seven-year-old daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) even more accusing.And with her unusual lifestyle, fittingly red clothing and seemingly defiant attitude toward religion (despite its optimistic and good-hearted facade), Vianne doesn't get the warmest welcome from the townspeople. Yet she's ready to win each heart, one by one, all it will take is one taste from each one's favorite chocolate (which she mysteriously guesses) to reignite a marital flame, or even draw a smile in the face of Armande, her opinionated landlady, played by Judi Dench, the second perfect casting of the film. Armande's bitterness is the sad result of a conflict with her overprotective daughter Caroline (Carrie Ann-Moss) who's forbidden her son Luc to visit his 'badly-influencing' grandmother. The chocolate shop soon becomes the refuge for Armande and Luc to meet each other and develop a secret bond.The other subplots involve Josephine (Lena Olin) who's brutalized by Serge, her drunken husband, the bartender played by Peter Stormare, and as expected, her growing friendship with Vianne gives her enough confidence to stand against Serge during a violent assault, when she finally overpowers him with a skillet. Thankfully, this is the kind of uninspired caricature that only works because the movie doesn't get any further. The film remains faithful to its initial tone, and never falls in the temptation to depict the religious townspeople as intolerant bigots. And even Molina remains closer to a more aristocratic version of Hercule Poirot than any other mustached villain; he's a man whose prejudices are rooted in marital troubles that led him to vent his anger on a free-spirited female like Vianne. But the film intelligently avoids the reverse Manichaeism that would have placed religion or men as the obligatory scapegoats.Chocolat is all about allowing one's spirit to elevate beyond the limits dictated by a book, and find one's own truth within the inner beauty of what life, or God for that matter, has to offer. Little Anouk has an imaginary friend named Pantoufle, a kangaroo with an injured leg, but it's just an innocent touch to highlight that she's inherited her mother's mysterious sparkle. A romance also blooms with the arrival of a group of gypsies, drafting along the river, among them the handsome guitar player named Roux (Johnny Depp). Depp's chemistry with Binoche never feels like a plot device we do believe a woman who was so badly received would embrace newcomers with a more generous heart. At the end, all the characters' arcs close in an emotionally satisfying way, not always unpredictable, but it doesn't really affect the enjoyment.Of course, it's tempting to judge Chocolat with more cynical eyes, but how about imagining how respectful to the audience's sensitivity, the film remains? How one-dimensionally feminist it would have been if other women were victims of men's abuses, how simplistically sentimental if a mother-and-daughter argument between Armande and Caroline had broken, while a simple look was enough to show that the two women finally made peace. And finally, how dreadfully caricatured if an angry torch-wielding mob came to burn the chocolate shop&#x85; well, I'm grateful to the story for not having taken this path and yet kept the overall simplicity of its plot without depicting the villagers as a one-dimensional bunch, in a way or another.The film's spirit is magnificently conveyed by a catchy guitar tune, transporting us in a universe where benign and innocent temptations, open the Pandora box where we can find the key to our own happiness.

What Spielberg has done here has transcended the viewing of a motion picture and created an experience in movie making. This is emotional, unbelievable storytelling and a depiction of a war that makes you feel like you are there. Now is this the most original story ever told? No. The storm of Normandy has been shown before. The story has been told before. (This is pretty much another story like that of the Brother's Sullivan, who are talked about in the movie)However - It has NEVER been depicted like this EVER! The first thirty minutes of this movie will have you glued to the screen. If there is popcorn in front of you it will NOT be getting touched let alone passed anywhere. It is brutal, real, amazing, shocking, TRUE and for a movie the most real battle scene ever put on screen. Spielberg puts you on the beach. The sounds alone envelope you. This is a movie for the big screen and surround sound. Also, I must mention the amazing John William's musical score is nothing less then brilliant accompanying the visuals on screen. That music alone tells such an emotional fantastic story!Actual War veterans who lived through this part of our history said for the most part that what you are seeing on screen by Spielberg is the closest thing ever depicted of that war besides actually being there.

I had heard about this but never seen it before. It was OK for its time.The movie is about a group of teenagers who have just graduated and it is their last night in town before they go off to college.The movie runs along quite smoothly. There is not a lot happening to be honest. It is about the relationships between these kids with their friends and girlfriends. There are some very nice cars in it, and even some car street races. These were shot very well and were really entertaining. Especially the final crash! There are so many different things going on during this time. The whole film is set during one night which is a nice touch.You have Curt who can't decide if he wants to leave for college as he is having second thoughts. Curt is played by Richard Dreyfuss. Richard did a great job like always. I think Richard is a great actor and should make more movies. He has already made so many classic films. Steve is Curts friend who is going to college with Curt. Curt is happy to be going to college and wants to spend one final night with his girlfriend before he leaves her behind&#x85; the problem is, Steve doesn't really know how to talk to her and things do not go as smoothly as he hopes. Steve is played by Ron Howard. Ron was OK, but he is not the best actor. He did make me laugh a few times though which was great. Ron is a much better director than he ever was an actor so I am glad he found his feet behind the camera after Happy Days&#x85; although I did love Happy Days when I was a kid.Other cast members were Paul Le Mat, Charles Martin Smith, Cindy Williams, Candy Clark, Mackenzie Phillips, Bo Hopkins and a very young Harrison Ford. The cast was quite good. There was not anyone that was that bad. There were a few moments in the film that I thought the acting wasn't brilliant, but back in 1973 when this film was made, the acting was a completely different class than it is now.The soundtrack to the movie was brilliant. I love the old songs that were played throughout the movie. I think it is possibly the perfect soundtrack to the era of the film. I have always thought the 60s looked awesome. If I could travel through time I would visit the 60s.The action sequences were OK and the story was OK. I have seen similar movies to this and they all pretty much are similar to each other, but I still enjoyed this.I will give this 6 out of 10.Your car is uglier than I am!For more reviews, please like my Facebook pagehttps\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews\/456572047728204?ref=hl ","genre":null},{"date":"21 October 2013","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" American GRAFFITIA very early George Lucas film.

Richard did a great job like always. I think Richard is a great actor and should make more movies. He has already made so many classic films. Steve is Curts friend who is going to college with Curt. Curt is happy to be going to college and wants to spend one final night with his girlfriend before he leaves her behind&#x85; the problem is, Steve doesn't really know how to talk to her and things do not go as smoothly as he hopes. Steve is played by Ron Howard. Ron was OK, but he is not the best actor. He did make me laugh a few times though which was great. Ron is a much better director than he ever was an actor so I am glad he found his feet behind the camera after Happy Days&#x85; although I did love Happy Days when I was a kid.Other cast members were Paul Le Mat, Charles Martin Smith, Cindy Williams, Candy Clark, Mackenzie Phillips, Bo Hopkins and a very young Harrison Ford. The cast was quite good. There was not anyone that was that bad. There were a few moments in the film that I thought the acting wasn't brilliant, but back in 1973 when this film was made, the acting was a completely different class than it is now.The soundtrack to the movie was brilliant.

I had heard about this but never seen it before. It was OK for its time.The movie is about a group of teenagers who have just graduated and it is their last night in town before they go off to college.The movie runs along quite smoothly. There is not a lot happening to be honest. It is about the relationships between these kids with their friends and girlfriends. There are some very nice cars in it, and even some car street races.

I have always said that if Great Britain were defeated in war, I hoped we should find a Hitler to lead us back to our rightful position among the nations. - Winston Churchill Heavily influenced by Jean Renoir's La Grande Illusion (1937), Billy Wilder's Stalag 17 takes place within a German prisoner of war camp during World War 2's final years. The film was released in 1953 and is regarded as one of Wilder's early masterpieces.Stalag's first half develops a subplot in which J.J Sefton, an American black marketeer, is suspected by his comrades of having spied for their German captors. This subplot has been read as a comment on McCarthyism, but if that were so, its resolution, in which Sefton and his buddies band together to weed out the real rat, misses the historical lesson of McCarthyism entirely.Stalag 17 is aided greatly by Ernest Laszlo's grim black-and-white cinematography. Wilder's direction is also expert, though the film too often prettifies life in the camps. This is a feel good POW movie, very Hollywood, and anticipates Wilder's later, lighter, Lubitsch styled comedies (as well as the transvestite humour of Some Like It Hot). On the flip side, Wilder teases out a number of very bittersweet and even grim moments, and his Sefton character, infectiously played by William Holden, is always interesting. Pragmatism incarnate, Sefton is a profiteer, a merchant, always taking bets and treating the survival of his comrades as a game of profit, loss, risk and reward. Like Rick in Casablanca, Sefton then calls himself into action, the film ending with him risking his guts for another human being. Is this an act of altruism, though, or another scheme by Sefton undertaken solely because he likes the odds? Bizarrely, Wilder portrays Sefton's profiteering as being detrimental within both the collective confines of the barracks, and the larger landscape of war. When Sefton is labelled a traitor by his fellow Americans, his bounty and profits are then appropriated by the group and distributed amongst the men. Ironically, Allied involvement in WW2 was designed to stop precisely this kind of collectivism. As the Governor of the Bank of England himself quipped, British loans to Hitler should be seen as an investment against Bolshevism and communism. Far from an enemy, the monarchs and aristocrats across Europe, of whom Winston Churchill himself belonged (most of the royalty in Germany, England and Russia were related), championed the German Army. Fearful of revolutions, civil wars, and losing their power, they saw Hitler (and even Mussolini, who Churchill routinely praised) as a weapon to be used against Marxists, Jews, Bolsheviks and Russia itself. A further irony is that, without Stalin's bloody brand of collectivization, Hitler perhaps wouldn't have been defeated; statistically, 79-89% of all Nazi casualties were inflicted by the Soviets.Stalag 17 would prove hugely influential, shaping everything form The Bridge On The River Kwai to The Great Escape to Papillon to King Rat. It would influence the farcical TV show Hogan's Heroes, and would be one of Wilder's last dramas (Witness for the Prosecution and The Spirit of St Louis would follow some years later), the director gradually moving toward comedies.8\/10 &#x96; Worth two viewings.

Of course its all conjecture, but if I were to guess this would be my interpretation of the title.The movie opens with an introduction to Harry and Sara Goldfarb, an overindulged young man whose only concern is his next fix and a doting single mother who yearns for her son's well-being. Sara's only escape from the drudgery of her routine suburban life is her daily escape through television, in particular a weight loss show called 'Juice by Tappy'. The carefree, drug fueled existence of Harry, his gorgeous girlfriend Marion and friend Tyrone sets up a sharp contrast to the lonely, ordinariness of Sara's life, her obsession with television, and her diet fads. We are seduced by a life of excitement, danger, rule breaking, youthful dreams with endless possibilities, drugs and sex. The glamour of these drug- induced utopias make Harry and Tyrone's schemes seem like a means to beautiful possibilities. This constantly switches between the manic lifestyle that Sara's desperation to lose weight has led her to. Her depression and loneliness is alleviated by an unexpected invitation into a world of glamour, however this soon gives way to an anxiety that she no longer fits in. In her desperation we see her becoming completely reliant on 'diet pills'. Morning, noon, evening, night, morning, noon, evening, night, morning, noon, evening, night. She spirals further and further down the rabbit hole of addiction, tragically unaware, she seems to think its a harmless quick fix. As her body wastes away she is plagued by paranoid delusions. Even through this, she remains oblivious. A true success story in her mind. Alternately, the youngsters are constantly on the prowl for their next fix. The failure of their schemes, leaves them desperate. The movie is a work of art. Each scene is carefully choreographed visually and the soundtrack and sound effects and meticulously planned. The intensity of the mood created because of these visual and musical elements is quite magical. Reminiscent of the drama of a Scorcece film and the lurid quality of a Fincher film, it comes together in a remarkably artful way. The characters are rich and complex and each of the performances are arresting. Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans are believable, genuine and surprisingly endearing. Jennifer Connely is BEAUTIFUL, fragile and feminine. But Ellen Burstyn steals the show! Her performance is lurid, and gut wrenching.

And for George Bernard Shaw's Pygmallion, all it took was the ingenuity of Moss Hart to get together with Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Lowe to create a classic Broadway musical that not only ran for years but began several long-running touring companies and created a legendary film that is absolutely perfect in structure even if slightly overlong and featuring a leading lady some say was not right for the ingénue role.I disagree when it comes to the presence of Audrey Hepburn in this part. Yes, Julie Andrews had what it took on Broadway not to only be the messy looking flower girl but the great lady in beautiful gowns as well. She also had the windpipes to belt out such classics as Wouldn't It Be Loverly? and I Could Have Danced All Night. Jack Warner obviously didn't want to take the chance on an unknown (even though she really wasn't unknown; She was popular for TV and theater, having played Guenevere in Camelot) so Audrey Hepburn was cast. Envisioned by audiences and critics as too glamorous for the rags she wore while selling flowers, she didn't get the praise she deserved, even if those same audiences and critics did go ooh and ah! when she stepped down the stairs in her glamorous outfits for the Ascot Gavotte and the later ball sequence.Rex Harrison does repeat his role as the very ego-maniacal Henry Higgins, the eternal teacher of language who bets his pal Colonel Pickering (Wilfred Hyde White) that he can turn a flower girl into a duchess. It takes lots of chocolates and marbles being swallowed before Eliza (Hepburn) can be presented to London society where she meets Higgins' aristocratic but kind mother (Gladys Cooper). Eliza bedazzles society with her earthiness, especially Freddie Eynsford Hill (Jeremy Brett) who of sings his love for her in the breathtaking On the Street Where You Live. But can Eliza escape from her past, especially when she keeps running into her blaggard father Alfred (the wonderful Stanley Holloway) who first sings of With a Little Bit of Luck as he avoids work, cops, and getting married. That last part of course, changes when he announces he's Getting Married in the Morning. The extremely heavy set woman Holloway dances with in this big production number is none other than Ayllene Gibbons, the bed-ridden mother who devours a whole turkey in the cult classic The Loved One. This film is jam-packed with moments of greatness, from the rose-filled opening credits and that fabulous overture, the delightfully campy Ascot Gavotte (two wealthy matrons eying each other when each of them shows up in the same original), the presence of Higgins' former student (Theodore Bikel) who exposes Eliza as a fraud, and finally the show-down between Higgins and Eliza after he has exploited her and the venomous Without You that leads to her declaring to him that you shall never see me again.Yes, there's something about Higgins that makes him a male chauvinist pig, but there's also something very gentle and tender about him, even if he is adverse to showing it. You can see men like this existing in this time and sure in their ego of who they are and how they lived their life. All Eliza wanted was the chance to become a lady and work in a real flower shop rather than sell them on the street, so no gold digger is she. Mona Washbourne plays housekeeper Mrs. Pearce with a loving yet imperious character who finally stands up for Eliza, and Gladys Cooper is noble yet not without spunk as Higgins' moral but outspoken mother. Sharp-eyed classic film fans will recognize Isobel Elsom as Freddie's mother, remembering her with glee as the matron murdered by Ida Lupino and her sisters in Ladies in Retirement 23 years before.Artistically, musically and technically speaking, this is outstanding on every level. It is one of those films one must try to see on a big screen during one's lifetime, and with its 50th anniversary coming up, a big-screen re-release is certainly not a bad idea. Director George Cukor finally won his long-awaited Oscar for this, and while Audrey Hepburn failed to be nominated (in a year where Julie Andrews won for Mary Poppins), her contributions to the film cannot be ignored, either. Some may quibble that Marni Nixon's dubbing of Hepburn too quickly looses its cockney accent when, after declaring The Rain in Spain Stays Mainly in the Plain she begins to sing of Dancing All Night with narry an aye or garn in earshot, but when you've got all this other brilliance, why care?

This film is jam-packed with moments of greatness, from the rose-filled opening credits and that fabulous overture, the delightfully campy Ascot Gavotte (two wealthy matrons eying each other when each of them shows up in the same original), the presence of Higgins' former student (Theodore Bikel) who exposes Eliza as a fraud, and finally the show-down between Higgins and Eliza after he has exploited her and the venomous Without You that leads to her declaring to him that you shall never see me again.Yes, there's something about Higgins that makes him a male chauvinist pig, but there's also something very gentle and tender about him, even if he is adverse to showing it. You can see men like this existing in this time and sure in their ego of who they are and how they lived their life. All Eliza wanted was the chance to become a lady and work in a real flower shop rather than sell them on the street, so no gold digger is she. Mona Washbourne plays housekeeper Mrs. Pearce with a loving yet imperious character who finally stands up for Eliza, and Gladys Cooper is noble yet not without spunk as Higgins' moral but outspoken mother. Sharp-eyed classic film fans will recognize Isobel Elsom as Freddie's mother, remembering her with glee as the matron murdered by Ida Lupino and her sisters in Ladies in Retirement 23 years before.Artistically, musically and technically speaking, this is outstanding on every level. It is one of those films one must try to see on a big screen during one's lifetime, and with its 50th anniversary coming up, a big-screen re-release is certainly not a bad idea. Director George Cukor finally won his long-awaited Oscar for this, and while Audrey Hepburn failed to be nominated (in a year where Julie Andrews won for Mary Poppins), her contributions to the film cannot be ignored, either. Some may quibble that Marni Nixon's dubbing of Hepburn too quickly looses its cockney accent when, after declaring The Rain in Spain Stays Mainly in the Plain she begins to sing of Dancing All Night with narry an aye or garn in earshot, but when you've got all this other brilliance, why care?

Yes, like the billions of other fans, I have seen this so many times I pretty much know it by heart. Like The Wizard of Oz, I have seen it both on television and the big screen, and have decided that for at least the next 10 years, I am leaving it alone. Still, one cannot forget about it, no matter how hard one tries. With sing-along showings of it at the Hollywood Bowl, constant dredging up at piano bars and the many spoofs it has received, The Sound of Music has not died in my heart, just become momentarily dormant.I actually prefer the stage version (a 1995 revival) to the movie, as it was not overloaded with helicopter covered shots of the Alps or constant liederhosen clad kids, and basically stuck to the flour of the story rather than the frosting. Yet, there is something unshakable of Julie Andrews in her second big Nanny film as Maria Rainer Von Trapp, the former postulate who ends up marrying her employer and helps him escape from the Nazis.In the first dozen times I saw this, I of course was overwhelmed by the helicopter shot of the Alps that eventually closes in on Julie twirling around the mountainside. What I did miss was the opening verse of the title song, sung so simply by Mary Martin in the 1959 original and Rebecca Luker decades later. The opening is equivalent to that of director Robert Wise's other big movie musical, West Side Story, even if the locations and mood are as far from each other as they can get. When the nuns sing of their issues with Maria (which includes a future General Hospital legend, Anna Lee, as well as movie musical dubber Marni Nixon), I am in delight, because like those nuns, I too am conflicted by her. So how will she deal with the seven bratty children of Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) and his whistle blowing and his baroness fiancée (a cynical Eleanor Parker)? This sweet set-up, though, has serious overtones as World War II is blooming as much as the edelweiss, and after Maria and the Captain fall in love, the world changes from teaching the kids the notes to sing to finding a way to get out a country that while beautiful on the outside is in danger of becoming ugly on the inside. This changes the second half of the film (as it did the play) from a learning experience for all of these characters to a survival lesson where they must struggle to Climb Every Mountain.Somewhat overproduced and certainly extremely long, it is still a crowd- pleaser that I can't recommend highly enough. Yes, my rating is not a 10, but that's from possibly too many viewings, sometimes too soon. Everybody shines in the film, although in a few particular moments, Plummer's phrasing and delivery of his dialog seems a bit awkward. It's nice to see Richard Haydn playing a character not as annoying as those he did in The Late George Apley and Sitting Pretty; He's obviously an opportunist and not afraid to admit it, yet in a few spots, shows definite heroism. Parker gets some great bitchy lines to deliver and adds some needed salt into the sugary proceedings.The heart and soul of the film, though, is Peggy Wood's Mother Superior, the equivalent in Rodgers and Hammerstein's cavalcade to Oklahoma's Aunt Eller, Carousel's Nettie, South Pacific's Bloody Mary and The King and I's Madame Thiang. She's not without some imperfections, and when she barrels out her line, Are you in love with him?, it seems as if she's looking for a good piece of gossip. But when Anna Lee and Portia Nelson (later All My Children's long-time baby sitter Mrs. Gurney) admit they have sinned, her reaction is priceless and a proper send-off. Family Guy crudely spoofed this scene years later.As for Julie Andrews, how can you not like her? She didn't get to repeat her Broadway roles at all, but fortunately 20th Century Fox got her for this, and I must say, her Maria is certainly more appealing as a Nanny than her Mary Poppins. It's obvious that she loves these children, is humble and far from the other worldly creature of the role for which she had just won an Oscar.

Outstanding theater can make you weep, and in the case of West Side Story, it isn't just the tragedy of the story but the way it is told through song and dance with Leonard Bernstein's music, Stephen Sondheim's lyrics and Jerome Robbins' choreography. Bring on Robert Wise to take on the dramatic sequences (sharing credit with Robbins) and you have a great start already. Casting choices for the leads aside, everything else meshes, turning into a film that 50 years later is sure to impress. A recent Broadway revival also managed to bring the Broadway show back to life, utilizing the changes of certain songs for mood and emotion, particularly switching the location of Gee Officer Krupke! and Cool to different acts than the original production to increase tension and bring the audience even deeper into the story.Also recently on Broadway, West Side Story's original source, Romeo and Juliet, was altered to suit racial tensions, but while that was an important part of West Side Story's legacy, it was unnecessary for Romeo and Juliet. Here, late 1950's\/early 1960's Manhattan is utilized as the playground for two gangs of different backgrounds the mainland born Jets and the Puerto Rican natives, the Sharks. Neither gang is devoid of sympathy and unlike Romeo and Juliet, there is certainly no villain. Riff of The Jets is certainly decent, yet misguided, and all Bernardo of The Sharks wants is to be accepted into his new land and make a home with his sister Maria and girlfriend Anita. It is obvious by their manners that Bernardo and his pals probably tried to be cordial to the Jets but individual prejudices got in the way to prevent that. Even so, the Jets are products of their upbringing, and while the gang is obviously violent and the newcomers hot-tempered, neither one can be blamed other than what society had pushed them into becoming.Jerome Robbins' choreography is prevalent from the start, the opening airshot of Manhattan and surrounding eras pouring into the close-up of the gangs at war. The dance is masculine and exciting, and there is never any evidence of any of these men being any less than macho. Even the rumble later on is disturbingly choreographed, as is the post-rumble Cool! where the Jets prepare to go on after tragedy has struck. To lighten things up, Robbins has the fun but tense Dance at the Gym (hosted by none other than The Addams Family's John Astin!) and the hopeful America, changed from the original all-female version to include the male Sharks as well.Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood have been riddled with attacks of miscasting, and I do agree that they are not the most magnetic of screen lovers. The heat, however, does come on when Rita Moreno (replacing Chita Rivera as Anita) and George Chakaris get together as Anita and Bernardo, and their chemistry is intense yet playful. During the Quintet reprise of Tonight! it is Moreno's preparation for Bernardo's arrival that reveals the sexual passion she feels and makes what happens even more tragic.

I'm sure many a gay man jumped out of their seats in laughter when she guest starred on The Nanny and started a scene with Fran Drescher by saying A boy like that to kill your brother...High praise, too, for Russ Tamblyn for his role of Riff.

(I'm referring to certain lyrics in West Side Story).

Outstanding theater can make you weep, and in the case of West Side Story, it isn't just the tragedy of the story but the way it is told through song and dance with Leonard Bernstein's music, Stephen Sondheim's lyrics and Jerome Robbins' choreography. Bring on Robert Wise to take on the dramatic sequences (sharing credit with Robbins) and you have a great start already. Casting choices for the leads aside, everything else meshes, turning into a film that 50 years later is sure to impress. A recent Broadway revival also managed to bring the Broadway show back to life, utilizing the changes of certain songs for mood and emotion, particularly switching the location of Gee Officer Krupke! and Cool to different acts than the original production to increase tension and bring the audience even deeper into the story.Also recently on Broadway, West Side Story's original source, Romeo and Juliet, was altered to suit racial tensions, but while that was an important part of West Side Story's legacy, it was unnecessary for Romeo and Juliet. Here, late 1950's\/early 1960's Manhattan is utilized as the playground for two gangs of different backgrounds the mainland born Jets and the Puerto Rican natives, the Sharks. Neither gang is devoid of sympathy and unlike Romeo and Juliet, there is certainly no villain. Riff of The Jets is certainly decent, yet misguided, and all Bernardo of The Sharks wants is to be accepted into his new land and make a home with his sister Maria and girlfriend Anita. It is obvious by their manners that Bernardo and his pals probably tried to be cordial to the Jets but individual prejudices got in the way to prevent that. Even so, the Jets are products of their upbringing, and while the gang is obviously violent and the newcomers hot-tempered, neither one can be blamed other than what society had pushed them into becoming.Jerome Robbins' choreography is prevalent from the start, the opening airshot of Manhattan and surrounding eras pouring into the close-up of the gangs at war. The dance is masculine and exciting, and there is never any evidence of any of these men being any less than macho. Even the rumble later on is disturbingly choreographed, as is the post-rumble Cool! where the Jets prepare to go on after tragedy has struck. To lighten things up, Robbins has the fun but tense Dance at the Gym (hosted by none other than The Addams Family's John Astin!) and the hopeful America, changed from the original all-female version to include the male Sharks as well.Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood have been riddled with attacks of miscasting, and I do agree that they are not the most magnetic of screen lovers. The heat, however, does come on when Rita Moreno (replacing Chita Rivera as Anita) and George Chakaris get together as Anita and Bernardo, and their chemistry is intense yet playful. During the Quintet reprise of Tonight! it is Moreno's preparation for Bernardo's arrival that reveals the sexual passion she feels and makes what happens even more tragic.

I've found that his efforts in that genre to be on the mediocre side, at best (yes, even Halloween). - But, for him to dare to tackle a Comedy\/Romance was a certified boo-boo that came mighty close to falling flat on its supremely unfunny face.About the only thing that kept Big Trouble's head above water were the sequences involving the amusing and often over-the-top battles of wild Kung Fu fighting. And, yes, even these scenes got a tad tiresome after seeing it done one too many times.At this point I don't think that I need to re-cap Big Trouble's story-line for you. Once you wade through its excessive muck it all comes down to being just a badly-contrived Boy-Meets-Girl story that features lots of fancy, bright lights and other such embellishments to hoodwink the viewer into thinking that this film is actually something more than it really is.Yes, we are all certainly entitled to our own opinions about Big Trouble, but, to be told that I must excuse this film's glaring flaws and irksome inadequacies just because it was a product of the inexcusable 80s is just not satisfactory enough for me.
