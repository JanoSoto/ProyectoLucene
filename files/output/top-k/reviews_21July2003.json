[{"date":"21 July 2003","score":"","review":"  Election is a 1999 comedy starring Matthew Broderick, Reese Witherspoon and Chris Klein. The film follows under early narratives of the three main characters to give the audience a preview of things to come. Mr McAllister (Broderick) is the most popular teacher at Carver High and has won Teacher of The Year several years in a row. One thing that really gets to him is the annoying overachiever Tracy Flick (Witherspoon) who is always first with the hand up to answer questions in his History class. This is also thrown in with the fact Tracy had a fling with a teacher called Mr Novotny, one of McAllister's best friends and thus had gotten Novotny fired.Tracy decides to run for student body president and McAllister doesn't want to see Tracy winning everything. He will do anything to stop her and that includes getting Paul Metzler (Klein) to run against Tracy and hampering with the ballots for the student president. Throw in a few other, rather uneeded sub-plots such as Metzler's lesbian adopted little sister Tammy who decides to run again Paul for dating the girl she believes to be her soulmate, and you've got the basic view of the film that director Payne aimed to achieve.I recently purchased the DVD after a year or so of first seeing the movie. I found this to be a very entertaining film with many funny scenes and all round fun - even though others disagree. Tracy is extremely irrtating and you love to hate her - this is Reese Witherspoon after all, one of the most charismatic, funny and charming actresses of this generation. I rate this her second best performance behind the 2001 hit Legally Blonde.4 stars out of 5.
