It is completely subjective.Those who laughed at or with Andy Kaufman may like this Movie because it is basically Andy's material mimicked by Jim Carrey's in the skin performance. There is really not much else. Maybe an attempt to make the Comedian seem Human and we should empathize, forgive, and try to understand. It is a hit and miss Movie with some real Actors playing themselves that lend a you are there feel, but who among you really wants to be there. It is not a pleasant place or a fun time. According to the Movie, Kauffman spent most of His energy behind the scenes trying to convince everyone that everything is a joke.He comes across as probably the most misunderstood Performer in the History of Show Business. He did receive his 15 Minutes and an amount of Fortune. Deservedly or not, the troubled Man squandered it (or did He?). The Movie is as painful to watch, at times, as an Andy Kaufman skit. But there is quite an amount of Pathos toward the end that may soften it a bit for Mainstream Viewers. Overall it is a well crafted Movie that isn't very enlightening or entertaining or funny. Kind of like one of His Gigs. ","genre":null},{"date":"2 July 2013","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Comedy amounts to this. You either laugh or you don't.

","genre":"Biography, Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"2 July 2013","score":"","review":" This Neil Simon's comedy-drama incorporates a wry sense of Jewish humor as well as a wit of dialogue mostly missing in today's 21st century movies of the same genre. Unlike the more comedic belly laughs of today's cerebral funny stuff, Simon's movie has a more genuine cultural flavor that seamlessly enhances the ethnic ambiance and underlying nature of the film. The voice over blends in well with the mental dialogue that ordinary people often talk to themselves about. What is striking about this movie is its rhythm from friendly, how are you, get acquainted flow transitioning to the more intimate harshness of Jewish sternness of cold harsh personality derived from the likely bitter survival mode that many Jewish families suffered through during World War II. But Simon taps into the dysfunctional aftermath and subsequent emotional suffering of their offspring so well on display in this movie. What this movie accomplishes is a blend of comedy and drama in a manner that is both artistically well thought out but at the same time creating an environment and narrative that captures an audience's attention while all the while offering a constant running commentary underneath. Unlike such over the top comedic characters as Sandra Bullock in All Above Steve (2009), the characters of Simon's play are more real, taking the Jewish character and their own internal humor as his opening to the family dynamics of comedy. Unlike an usual ironic plot twist as Ricky Gervais's character contending with ghosts in Ghost Town (2008), or the unusual setting of irony used with Tropic Thunder (2008) where a group of actors finding themselves in a real war, or where men play as women in Connie and Carla (2004), Simon's movie offers up a more authentic flavor of family life and the psychological turmoil surrounding life experiences. Another ethnically layered movie with a rich comedic blend of narrative and plot outline might be Greek themed My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002), the disability-themed Lars and the Real Girl (2007), or the beauty competition for little girls concept of Little Miss Sunshine (2006), the Nanny Diaries (2007) with Scarlett Johansson, or the more recent gold standard Silver Lining Playbook (2012). While not as complex and more difficult balance as in the more darker comedy-drama in Death to Smoochy (2002) with Robin Williams, Lost in Yonkers surprisingly incorporates some of the dramatic intensity as approaching the emotive fulfillment as found in more serious dramas as in Margot at the Wedding (2007) or The Human Stain (2003).

Released in 1961, it puffs up location shots on Oahu and Elvis at his most machismo appearing in elegant suits, upscale resort wear and at his best physical tone ever in the skimpiest swimwear the censors would allow. Angela Lansbury, playing a rare turn for her as a physical comic marrying earlier her chauffeur in Atlanta and flying to Oahu to live and raise Elvis, has the only other superstar turn. There are more songs packed in than usual, two actually lyric rewrites of classic melodies and none representing Elvis' most famous contributions to the music world. The major money maker of his long film career, most of the storyboard is bot pleasant and enticing. The exception is the scene in which Elvis is expected to be the tour guide and chaperone of four teenage girls on vacation on the island, unaware their chaperone is the secret fiancée of Elvis' father's American mainland boss. Some of the tense sequences, when a young charge acts out by climbing into Elvis' bed to then bait Elvis into spending time behind bars when his fists fly at a hotel bar to then crash a stolen jeep as an underage driver on the lam, seem a bit to R rated and too melodramatic for the flow of a mild comedy with a mild romantic fantasy ending.
