[{"date":"10 February 2003","score":"","review":"  This teen movie was one of the teen movies of the late 90s that seemed to set the standard for the rest.  Teen movies after this seemed to echo this movie.  With movies like She's All That and Ten Things I Hate About You coming out around the same time as this movie, this movie was a breath of fresh air.  Sure, the point of this movie is for a guy to try to hook up with a girl.  This occurs in many teen movies.  But I liked how in this movie the guy was sort of the underdog, and he was chasing after the pretty popular girl.  In many teen movies you find a bad boy trying to change a girl into something she's not so that she becomes popular and liked by many.   Ethan Embry plays a great Preston Meyers.  He makes him down to earth but with a dorky edge.  Preston is the type of guy you'd love to hang out with.  He's not the most popular guy in the world, but he would be a great friend.  Jennifer Love Hewitt (in the teen movie world I like to call her Teen Movie Princess Love) plays Amanda Beckett.  Amanda is the type of girl you don't want to like, but in the end you know you just have to like her.  She's popular and pretty and kind of ditzy, but she makes up for it in the long run. The rest of the cast is great too.  We see a white homeboy Kenny Fisher (Seth Green), a friendly girl with not too many friends named Denise (Lauren Ambrose), a nerd who turns out to be one cool guy (Charlie Korsimo).  Also, check out main roles by Peter Facinelli, Erik Palladino, and more.  Plus smaller roles by later made even more famous people like Jamie Prestley, Melissa Joan Heart, Sean Patrick Thomas, Donald Faison, Selma Blair, Sara Rue, Jenna Elfman, Breckin Meyer, Liv Tyler, Jerry O'Connell, and more.  Oh yes, and it has a kick butt soundtrack.

Adrien Grenier plays Chase Hammond.  He's shown as the smart guy who is really a cutie even without the makeover.  Nicole Maris, his next door neighbor and one of the most popular girls in school, is played by Melissa Joan Heart.  I am not that big of a fan of Melissa, although I did like her early days on Clarissa Explains It All.  In this movie, Melissa's acting is just a good as it is on Sabrina The Teenage Witch, which isn't that great, but does get the job done and in a good way.  All through the movie kids, teens, and adults alike ask themselves Will Chase and Nicole go to the dance together?  I guess you'll never know unless you watch the movie, or I guess you know even if you haven't seen it.  Oh, but if you haven't seen it you missed an awesome soundtrack with songs like Crazy by Britney Spears (okay can you tell I was using sarcasm?).

Angie cooks for her father and brothers but one night she decides to let them fend for themselves, and she and Flipper get a little too friendly.  Make that a LOT too friendly.  One possible reason for her behavior  Angie's brothers mistreat her boyfriend because it seems no one is good enough for their sister.  Imagine what they would do to Flipper if they ever met him now. The rest of the movie focuses primarily on the reactions of various people to interracial romance and on a seemingly irrelevant plot line involving Flipper's crack-addicted brother Gator (another good performance, by Samuel L.Jackson), a real character who starts out funny and later becomes terrifying.  The black women in the movie get together and talk about how they're no longer good enough for black men; Flipper's wife is light-skinned but apparently that wasn't enough any more.  Angie's friends believe a black man coming into their neighborhood would likely get killed for trying to date one of their women.  And one of Angie's friends is disgusted by the whole idea of a black man.  The Italian men discuss a number of different views.

This just can't be a good film. Choice of music is indeed a rather contemporary, but soon cheerful atmosphere grabs your attention and the movie turns out to be one of the funniest and warmest medieval age comedies. Not that there's much movies in that genre though.Film features totally inaccurate history, popular modern music, such as rock, in comparison to historical scenery and a lot of little puns related to our times. Opening scene with We Will Rock You is just brilliant in all corniness.All elements are just plain wrong, but oddly enough they work perfectly together. Actors look like they've had fun of their lifetime and it shows up on a screen. Everyone seems to be enjoying their role. Paul Bettany as a writer Geoffrey Chaucer and Sir William's Herald did a fantastic work. Applause for him and his speeches!The way jousting was filmed did work very well and wasn't stretched to be too long or pathetic. Love story within the film wasn't tacky at all and supported other parts well.Story itself is a rather simple one with basic Hollywood cliches and the plot is wayyy predictable. That doesn't matter at all as the pace is pretty fast and the mood is joyful. It did even raise some emotions to surface despite of corny elements.I think Knights Tale shows a lively and even some ways a more realistic picture of people and life in old ages than many serious movies do. People had a sense of humor back then too, I assume. But knowledge of history is definitely not needed and the more you are interested in historical accuracy, the less you'll enjoy this experience.

We have seen comic books such as Blade, the X-men, Spider-Man, and now Daredevil made into movies.  And while most of these movies are great (with the exception of Daredevil because I haven't seen it yet), there is one movie in particular that came out in 1989 that stands head and shoulders above the rest of the pack.Batman is a dark movie with dark characters in it.  It isn't light-hearted nor are there amazing CGI fighting scenes as there are in Spider-man. However, there were four main people involved with the movie that really made it work.First, the director Tim Burton.  Burton is a dark director with a distinct vision of the world that makes his style easy to separate from the rest of Hollywood.  If Batman were directed by anybody else when it was made, it would have bombed miserably.  With Burton at the helm, the audience was not only able to witness Batman take on the Joker, but they also got a good look at the psychology of good vs. evil.  This was an approach that works with Batman because when the utility belt and bullet-proof costume are taken away from him, Bruce Wayne is an ordinary man with no super powers like those possessed by Superman and Spider-man.Second and third, the actors Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson.  While Keaton gave a great performance as the psychologically scarred caped-crusader, Nicholson stole the show with his rendition of the Joker. Could anybody have played these roles any better?  Keaton's private and reserved approach to playing Bruce Wayne was well done, and Nicholson is just his same brilliant self throughout the movie.  This duo had a great chemistry that could not be repeated with other actors in the three Batman sequels.Forth, Danny Elfman.  The music that was composed by Danny Elfman gave the movie itself a dark sound that helped set the tone for this dark movie. Elfman and Burton have worked together on many projects before and after this movie, but it is Batman that remains one of the best works for both men.  Elfman's somber musical tone not only reinforces the dark aspect of the movie, but in some cases, it stands out on its own.With the presence of these four people within this movie, there is no doubt that Batman will withstand the test of time as being one of the best superhero movies ever made.

But ever since then I've thought about it a little more, and now I would have to say that it's probably as good as everyone says it is. Quentin Tarantino did a wonderful job with this truly unique movie, which will keep viewers on the edge of their seats with thrills, surprises, and tense scenes. These and a great cast make it one of the greatest gangster movies of all time. Four criminals are assembled to pull off the perfect crime A huge robbery of a jewelry store. But their heist turns into an ambush when the cops unexpectedly arrive sooner than they thought. Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) escapes with a severely injured Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), and Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) gets away from the cops in a stolen car. Wisecracking Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), who recently got out of jail, went nuts during the robbery. Mr. White becomes suspicious of him, and accuses him of being the police informer he believes is in the group. Blonde, however, captured a cop as proof that he isn't the police informer. But who is? The twist filled plot unravels into a story that shows how the Reservoir Dogs came to be, and all of the flashbacks lead up to the disrupted robbery. Reservoir Dogs is a film that is filled to the rafters with great suspense and strong yet funny humor. Tarantino puts you right in the middle of it all with the flashback sequences, like when Mr. Orange tells Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney), `Nice Guy' Eddie Cabot (Chris Penn) and Mr. Blonde the story of when he walked into a bathroom filled with cops with a suitcase full of marijuana in his hands. I loved the film's beginning with the Dogs in the coffee shop, and of course, the ever-famous walking scene. The movie carries a lot of power and action that's perfectly done, allowing for some very memorable scenes. However, Tarantino also loads it with tons of violence and profanity, putting the F word in almost every sentence spoken. I was just praying that there would be a 10-second span with no cussing. But I guess that's just Quentin Tarantino, and the violence and profanity don't take the fun out of the ride (Although those elements would overshadow some of the good elements in Pulp Fiction). All in all, Reservoir Dogs is a cool movie with fun thrills, cool scenes, and memorable performances.

It was a bit silly, but it wasn't completely retarded either.They might have changed a lot coming from the game, but the only unforgivable change was the Kilrathi (see above). The fighters, carriers, and cruisers have a very plausable military look to them while still retaining some of the Wing Commander feel- plus there are realistic additions, like the ability to close off the launch bay on the famous Tiger's Claw carrier.I'm too tired to write a full review right now, but I have to say this movie is not as awful as you may think.

Sure, the actors were a bunch of pretty boys and girls, and the Kilrathi looked like rubber mice stuffed into battle armour, but the movie managed to do several things for me.(Some minor spoilers, but no real plot givaways following...)Battle in space is more realistically portrayed than many other movies I have seen. Cruisers fighting actually take time to fire at one another and move slowly because of their immense intertia. My favorite scene in *all* space type action movies is still Wing Commander's Give them a broadside, Mr. Gerald.To the person who was wondering why, upon engaging silent mode, he shhhd a crew member... although this seems unlikely in space, the ship was LANDED on a small asteroid. The Kilrathi (in the games, and also in the books based on the games) have probes that would be more than capable of dropping down to the surface of the asteroids and detecting vibrations.

After watching it again and having super low expectations I have to say it wasn't as bad as I remembered.  Granted, it still has some MAJOR flaws in the film, due to John Carpenter in my opinion (not a fan of his work, as you can tell from my other reviews of his films).This film really could have been great, without too much work and editing.  First of all get rid of the stupid Surgeon General of Beverly Hills character...in fact get rid of the entire scene (Bruce Campbell, I love your work, but I'm sorry, you've got go).  Secondly, get rid of Peter Fonda's character and any scene involving surfing within the film.  Next, axe Pam Grier's character, or at least give her a character overhaul and rethink the whole transsexual thing...pretty dumb!  And lastly, make a few minor adjustments here and there on various things and you've got yourself a pretty decent movie.I remember being less than impressed with the film's special effects when I first saw it.

Badlands is the best lovers-on-the-lam movie I've ever seen (it certainly makes True Romance look like a gimmicky fraud of a movie). Malick somehow manages to make everything seem painfully beautiful his landscape, his actors, his dialogue. There's something always elegiac about his movies.There's a picture of James Dean I saw from his youth -- a baseball team photo -- and the caption said something about how it captured his face, and in it, wisdom and sadness far beyond his years. That's what Malick does in his films and particularly in this film.He must have been a fan of James Dean (probably one of the reasons he chose to make Badlands, as a sort of homage), but not in the sense that coolness comes from a perfectly combed coiffure, a red leather jacket (which it wasn't -- it was a windbreaker) and a dark brood. There's a similar story here to that of Giant, set on a farm with that remarkable house, two men and one girl. Only Giant didn't have a philosophizing and very strange little girl.

Malick uses Manz as a sort of channel. If this is indeed some fashion of his own story, Malick tells us through her, with he visualized by Shepard, which is a somewhat brilliant approach. Manz is strangely philosophical; at once blunt and abstract. The story is obviously centered around her -- I don't see why this wouldn't be obvious -- but she's pushed into the background, commenting on the characters and informing us like God from above.As always with Malick, his film is mesmerizing and hypnotic. I was surprised that the film was only a little over an hour-and-a-half. The great Ennio Morricone created a wonderful score for this film that seems to forebode impending doom. Unlike his more famous spaghetti western scores, it's never overly-flamboyant.

All the acting is great,Brendan Fraser made a great likeable hero and he needs to be likeable so you don't want him to die in the suspenseful moments. I also really liked John Hannah as the comic relief. The only charectar I didn't particularly enjoy was Rachel Weisz's(all she really did was scream and get saved but she was pretty funny in the drunk scene). In conclusion see this movie for a fun time. I also recommend the Indiana Jones series.)

The movie had action, drama, love, comedy, and it was very well executed. It kinda felt like Con-Air when I watched that. It's one of those movies that isn't the best movie in the world, but you can watch it over and over, and the whole movie feels like a pre-movie preview. Always something happening, and it doesn't bore you at all.It's pretty fast paced and a very fun movie. I recommend it to all, especially Bruce Willis fans.Don't listen to the other cheesed**k wanna be film critics here, just watch the movie, you won't be disappointed.

First, this old creepy truck comes up out of no where on the bumper of the kids' car.  After giving them a scare, it finally passes them. Then a little ways down the road, they see someone dumping, what looks like a body down this pipe.  Then, the truck chases them again, which was very scary and finally runs them off the road. Throughout this, we get some laughs as the brother and sister exchange insults.  Darry gets the bright idea of looking down the pipe.  And what he finds down there is sick.  Later, we learn it is called the house of pain. One complaint is I would have liked this basement to have been more explained. As a matter of fact, it would have been nice to have been told a little bit more about the history of the Creeper.  And just because the church was burned, one would think the police still would have found the bodies and bones of the people in the basement.So, the two kids make it to a diner, where they get a phone call from a psychic, with a mysterious warning.  The next great scary scene is when they are driving back to the church with the police car behind them. Darry and Trish are talking while we see the Creeper on top of the police car in the background.It is still suspencful as they encounter the cat lady, and she confronts the Creeper.  After that it starts to get stupid and turns into the same old same old B horror movie with the killer chasing the stupid kids.  Basically from this point, the Creeper gets run over and follows the kids to a police station.  The psychic lady should have explained how the creature suddenly develops wings and maybe given other spooky stories about it.  In the finally scene, we see what the Creeper wanted, but that can be figured out by the song.FINAL VERDICT  The movie could have used a little more blood and gore. The first half was terrific and scary.  The second half is a cliche of a B horror movie.  The director and writer must have gotten lazy at that point.  Overall, I recommend this just because the first part is so good and the latter part isn't really bad, it is just predictable and unoriginal.

It seems like it would be the type of movie you could let your little ones see, but this movie doesn't use the best language and some things are a little too graphic for them.  Could be down right scary for little ones.  But since it is PG 13, I think that 13 and older is the right ages to see this one.  If you aren't a Jim Carrey fan, I doubt you would like this movie.  I am not a big Jim Carrey fan, but I did enjoy this movie.  This is Cameron Diaz's first movie --- ever.  And she does a great job in this movie.  She looks like a seasoned pro at acting.  Jim and Cameron have some great chemistry together in this movie, making this movie funny with a twist of romance.  I think one of my favorite characters in this movie was Milo the Dog, played by Max the Dog.  He was cute, spunky, and had some of the most memorable times on screen.  I really liked it when he put the mask on.  Much laughs.  It's a fun movie because the mask makes whoever is wearing it turn into what they feel deep down inside --- whether that be romantic and suave or mean and violent.  And when Jim wears the mask, expect lots and lots of humorous facial expressions and cartoon like imagery. ","genre":null},{"date":"10 February 2003","score":"","review":"  What a fun movie.
