Now I understand one reason why so many people hate it; that version has been cut up worse than the victim in a low-budget slasher movie. It's hideously trashed, and the censors turned a movie which rants against the glamorization of violence into a movie which glamorizes violence.Now I'm not generally a fan of violent movies for the sake of violence; I rate Tarantino's best at 2 or 3\/10 and I still think the worst parts of Natural Born Killers are those where much of Tarantino's original script was left in. But in this case there's a reason for the violence; in order to show how much the media glamorizes and encourages violent behaviour, Stone *has* to show us the contrast between what Micky and Mallory actually do and the dire TV shows which turn their killings into entertainment. We have to see how sick they really are, and how the media turn them into fun-loving celebrities who just happen to kill people.All in all, it's a great commentary on the soulless fight for ratings in the media, the hypocrisy of cops, the idiocy of media-sponsored fandom, and the hidden undercurrent of rage in modern society which is just waiting to spill out into the streets. One of my favorite movies of all time.Oh, but watch the Director's Cut; don't even think about wasting your time on the censored version.

At age 12, during a visit with my family to the famous Farmer's Market in Los Angeles, I found myself standing next to screen legend Gloria Swanson, and to her astonishment I not only knew who she was, but informed her that she was robbed when she was not given an Oscar for her performance in Sunset Boulevard. That was 34 years ago, and I still believe Gloria should have taken home the golden man.  Her brilliant performance has not been dimmed by the passage of time and the film is still an unchanged masterpiece. Brilliantly directed by Billy Wilder, who wrote the script with Charles Brackett, it was a side of Hollywood that was totally unseen before.  (The Hollywood of 1950 still believed their own publicity.)  But this story, so biting in its reality left many shocked and angry.  Wilder held the mirror up, and few were pleased with the reflection.  (Legend has it that MGM boss, Louis B. Mayer, stormed out of a screening and had to be subdued before he could punch the nose of very amused Billy Wilder.) I have seen the film countless times and never tire of seeing it again, so recently when I noticed that American Movie Classics was showing it one afternoon, I tuned in.  But this time, I made a promise to myself to keep my eyes off Gloria Swanson.  Her charactor of Norma Desmond so dominates the story that even when she is off screen, she is all you can think about.  So the film began and I watched everybody but her and was amazed that I saw the film in a totally different light. At first, I was extremely sympathetic to Joe Gillis, played by William Holden.  After all, he was struggling writer who just wanted his shot at success.  Circumstances, not by his choice, threw him into the world of Norma Desmond, a world where her star had shone bright above all the others, but dimmed, as he described, 10,000 midnights ago.  It was here that my feelings for Joe changed for the first time.  As I said, the film is so dominated by the presence of Gloria Swanson that I had failed to see something that was very plain for all to see.  Joe Gillis, as played by Holden, was not a victim at all, he was the guy in the black hat.  He was the bad guy. The original choice of to play Joe was 29 year-old Montgomery Clift.  This casting would have validated the supposed age difference between Norma and Joe. Clift, who had been in a similar liaison in the early stages of his career with singer Libby Holman, got cold feet and backed out of the project.  Holden was the replacement for two reasons, he was under contract with Paramount and he was available.  So despite his initial reservations, William Holden accepted the role.  Gloria Swanson looked the same age as the 31 year-old Holden, a fact that did not go unnoticed by Gloria herself. Wilder had requested the make up department to age the youthful looking 49 year-old actress during pre-production test shots until a frustrated Swanson snapped back; Why don't you try and make him (Holden) look younger?Holden plays Joe with a hard edge, a self-loathing for everyone including himself.  He feels compelled to take from Norma, feel pity for her, but hate her nonetheless.  His preference for Betty Schaefer (played by 21 year-old Nancy Olson) now seems a mystery.  Why this plain Jane over the glamorous Norma? The ending of the film also changed for me.  Joe really murdered Norma, not the other way around.  He knew how unbalanced  she was, yet he pushed her over the edge with glee.  When Norma takes the gun and aims it at Joe, I found myself feeling that the bastard got his just deserts, and felt satisfaction when he plunged into the pool riddled with bullets. Billy Wilder's first draft of the this story was a comedy that he wrote with Mae West in mind.  This Norma Desmond did in fact return to Paramount and would make Salome as her return to the people out there in the dark, which was so over the top the public assumed it was a comedy, becoming a huge hit, making Norma a star all over again. (This concept was used seventeen years later by Mel Brooks in The Producers.)  Apparently, Mae was not amused about playing a has-been, and Wilder re-wrote the treatment as a drama.  In a way, I'm sorry he changed the ending.  I would have loved to have seen Norma have the last laugh.

We followed Luke and Luke alone.  `The Empire Strikes Back' split the action at the end into two streams we saw Leia and Han fighting for their freedom, and Luke Skywalker confronting Vader.  `Return of the Jedi' split things three ways Endor, Death Star, rebel fleet.  And what do you know, `The Phantom Menace' divides the final action into FOUR streams.  If this trend continues things will start to get silly.  They already have.It's tempting to view `Return of the Jedi' as a sour omen of things to come. Lucas hired Richard `whatever you say, George' Marquand to direct his third Star Wars movie, which accounts for the general sluggishness.  He threw in pointlessly cuddly Ewoks.  Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher abandon the more adult romance of the previous film in order to play unconvincing second fiddles to all these furry things.  While John Williams's score retains its power, his source music is pretty weak.  Compared to the first two movies the dialogue is bland.  (It would get much blander come 1999.)  The story is an unimaginative re-hash of earlier work, except for Lucas's idea that bigger is better.  If the rebels have to do THREE things at once to travel INSIDE the EVEN BIGGER, DEADLIER Death Star with MORE SHIPS THAN EVER BEFORE in order to achieve an EVEN GREATER victory, it will surely make things more exciting - right?  Whatever you say, George.Special effects are particularly disappointing.  They're actually weaker than in the first two movies, with unbelievable - and I mean, literally unbelievable - muppets strewn all over the landscape.  (The blue vinyl elephant thing in Jabba's court gets my vote for most ridiculous alien.)  Oddly enough the digital adjustments of 1997 only made matters worse.  The computer-generated pop singer Lucas created looks every bit as fake as that stupid animal with the big lips it replaced - it merely looks fake in a different way; and, furthermore, the presence of the computer creatures makes the puppets look more fake than they would otherwise look, and vice versa.  Perhaps it doesn't matter very much.  The special effects, creature effects, costumes AND art direction, had all deteriorated, with or without digital vandalism.Yet despite all this the release of `The Phantom Menace' makes `Return of the Jedi' look better than ever.  The chief difference between the two is that the latter, unlike the former, has a reason for being made in the first place.  The story begun in the first two movies needed a conclusion.  It DIDN'T need a prologue.  If the conclusion stumbles a bit, well, we must take the rough with the smooth obviously the story had to end SOME way.  In any event, `Return of the Jedi' isn't a bad movie.  It coasts on the energy of the early movies, but it gets where it's going.

A plea to Christopher Guest  please please please make a director's cut DVD (even if it has to be multi-volumes).. there has got to be at least 10 hours of it that are at least half as hilarious as the released version.
