Overflowing with imagination and creativity, it manages to breathe new life into that trickiest of cinematic genres &#150; the surrealist satire.  Like all films that dare to take risks, `Being John Malkovich' sometimes stumbles in the paths it chooses to take, but at least its course is always an innovative and fascinating one.John Cusack stars as Craig Schwartz, a soft-spoken nebbish leading a life less of quiet desperation than of overwhelming blandness.  Unable to support himself as a puppeteer, he finally succumbs to his wife's pressure to seek out a job, landing a position as file clerk in a bizarre company located on the 7 ½ th floor of a Manhattan office building.  One of the triumphs of the film is that it portrays the surreal in such an understated and quiet way. This floor has ceilings so low that the people who work on it must continually crouch as they move about their business, yet they all accept that fact with an uncomplaining and unquestioning good humor.  Even when Schwartz discovers a strange portal hidden behind some cabinets leading directly into John Malkovich's brain, all those to whom Craig reveals his secret take very little convincing both to believe him and to experiment with it themselves.  Thus, by creating a world that already appears slightly askew in its reality &#150; Craig's wife, in addition, runs a pet shop and therefore fills their house with a menagerie of exotic animals &#150;the film makes it possible for us to go along with the characters' otherwise inexplicably blasé reactions.Writer Charlie Kaufman and director Spike Jonze hit upon a number of fascinating themes in the course of their bizarre musings.  Craig, for instance, learns that there exists a certain safety in the tediousness of everyday life, for the moment he allows the extraordinary to enter his ordered world he unleashes passions - that have been long dormant both in himself and his wife - which he finds himself unable to control.  His wife, in particular, whom he has mistakenly pigeonholed as a woman concerned only with the humdrum domesticities associated with married life, provides him with a rude awakening as she begins to surpass him in her burgeoning obsession with experiencing the excitements of sexual liberation.  Craig also discovers the terrifying truth about himself, that, beneath the façade of a meek, mild-mannered artist there lurks the soul of a repressed despot, as he comes more and more to relish the ability to move into Malkovich's mind and control his thoughts and actions &#150; much as with his beloved puppets, but now on a much more grand, much more malevolent scale.  The film generates much of its comic tension through the complex sexual interplay that develops among Craig, his wife, Lotte, and his alluring but enigmatic co-worker, Maxine, in whom both husband and wife develop a more than passing sexual interest.  With tinges of `No Exit,' the three characters find themselves caught in a frustrating world of overlapping and therefore clashing sexual desires and passions.The film demonstrates a real stroke of genius in its casting.  John Cusack, with his look of understated bewilderment, perfectly conveys the soul of a man too long accustomed to expecting little in the way of surprise out of life.  Catherine Keener brilliantly captures the detached cynicism and taunting coolness that makes her such an enthralling sexual temptation to both Craig and Lotte.  And whose audacious decision was it to cast Cameron Diaz as the near-dowdy second fiddle to Kenner, to make her the NON-sex object in the film?  As for Mr. Malkovich himself, he seems to be having the self-deprecating time of his life as he allows himself and even his lack of general public name recognition to become targets for gentle ribbing.`Being John Malkovich' is not a perfect movie.  It occasionally sags in places and suffers from some repetition and, like many utterly original and audacious works, it sometimes alienates its audience through its quality of often-cold calculation.  At moments in which the iconoclasm seems to become an end in itself, one may be tempted to see the film in emperor's-new-clothes terms, wondering if what one is seeing is really as brilliant as it appears or just an intellectual scam being played on a self-congratulatory elite audience.

I never thought it would, to be honest.  Episodes IV, V, and VI were so far ahead of their time when they were released that they made movie history.  It's very difficult to top something like that.  While this film is packed with computer animation and has some very excellent action scenes (the pod race scene is excellent), I believe that the animation put the film over the edge.  Put simply, there was just too much of it.  I'm sure that every director and studio just loves computer animation, and this film had pretty good effects!

The storyline here is actually pretty good, and follows well with the type of plot that should be expected of any Star Wars film.  This movie certainly remains true to its roots , so to speak, and that was nice to see.  I'm also glad that Lucas didn't stray from the art of telling a good story by showing us events happening in other areas.  He also kept the usual Star Wars scene change of having the current scene replaced by one in a different place by having the new scene move in across the old one.

However, I think that Natalie Portman (Queen Amidala) steals the show here.  Her acting is above that of Carrie Fisher as the female 'lead' in the earlier Star Wars series, and it will be interesting to see how they develop her character in the rest of the prequels.This film is mandatory for any Star Wars fan, but I'm sure it will have a lower appeal to the average person, which is the reason why Episodes IV, V, and VI were released earlier in the first place.

The storyline here is actually pretty good, and follows well with the type of plot that should be expected of any Star Wars film.  This movie certainly remains true to its roots , so to speak, and that was nice to see.  I'm also glad that Lucas didn't stray from the art of telling a good story by showing us events happening in other areas.  He also kept the usual Star Wars scene change of having the current scene replaced by one in a different place by having the new scene move in across the old one.  While some believe that is a 'cheesy' effect, it still remains familiar, and I'm glad it's kept here.Liam Neeson (Qui-Gon Jinn) and Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan) are good in their roles, and Jake Lloyd is excellent as a young Anakin Skywalker.  However, I think that Natalie Portman (Queen Amidala) steals the show here.  Her acting is above that of Carrie Fisher as the female 'lead' in the earlier Star Wars series, and it will be interesting to see how they develop her character in the rest of the prequels.This film is mandatory for any Star Wars fan, but I'm sure it will have a lower appeal to the average person, which is the reason why Episodes IV, V, and VI were released earlier in the first place.  However, The Phantom Menace carries on the tradition of one of the best science-fiction franchises in the history of film.My Rating  9.5\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"3 June 2000","score":"","review":"  I found Man on the Moon to be an entertaining and informative film on the life of Andy Kauffman.

I'm sure this is partly due in no small part with a star power draw like Ben A. and Matt D.  But I got the feeling this is pointed towards the MiddleoftheroadAmericanCatholic. (Yes, this writer is a card-carrying member of this club...)In the movie, Bethany (Linda Fiorentino), a Catholic abortion clinic worker (just the kind of person who becomes most in touch with God) who is going thru a crisis of faith is visited in the night by a seraphim (Alan Rickman) who informs her that she is to stop two fallen angels from entering a church or otherwise cease existence as we know it.  The two fallen angels, Loki and Bartleby (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck), are responsible for the early biblical wrath of God events, and have fallen out of favor (banished to Wisconsin), and are looking for a way back in.  When a Cardinal introduces a Catholicism Wow! campaign complete with Buddy Christ icon, they hear about a loophole-Plenary Indulgence-in which anyone who goes into this church is forgiven of their sins.  Their ticket back to heaven.  Along the way, Bethany gets help from Rufus (Chris Rock), the unknown 13th apostle, heavenly muse Serendipity (Salma Hayek), and Jay and Silent Bob (natch) in a much more expanded role in the movie.  Round out this movie universe with demon Azrael (Jason Lee), who has his own agenda against Lucifer, and his lackeys who are helping clear the path for Loki and Bartleby, and even a cameo by God.People of a decidedly non-Catholic persuasion may have a harder time appreciating the finer points of the dialog and passing it off as boring biblical background, and the violence and gore may definitely turn off people who had no idea of what they were getting into when they walked in the theatre\/rented the movie. (The poop demon probably could've been left out, but it was sort of a turning point in the plot) I could also see the more fundamentalist types finding the thought provoking concepts proffered in the film to be downright offensive.  On the surface the film may skewer some of the inconsistencies of Catholicism but the core idea of faith in God (or insert Supreme Being here) is ultimately underscored.  Anyone not willing to open their mind a little need not apply.Having heard the original cut clocking in at close to 3 hours some of the slower spots may have been able to explain themselves out a little better, but given the amount of territory covered, the script was mighty meaty with what still remained.  This script did make sense to this reviewerwithaCatholicbackground...I honestly can't find much fault with anybody's roles in this, and yes, Salma held her own, but definitely no Oscar nominations from this role. Alan Rickman has his Cynical Brit role down to a science, but still thoroughly enjoyable.  To find out Jay and Silent Bob had a major role in this film (you must see the other Smith films to appreciate this duo) pleased me to no end.  Chris Rock as Rufus was great, and Linda Fiorentino played a character that showed a real humanity for someone on a mission from God-you have to wonder if all the Saints went thru such deep upheaval. And of final noteworthiness, it was a very interesting plot twist when the fallen angels take a role reversal of sorts-the fury switching from Loki to Bartleby was simply inspired.  Yes. Ben and Matt did well with their roles...A very captivating movie more likely appreciated by those of us who had Catholicism as an intrinsic part of our childhood and who have grown to a larger perspective.

While this one doesn't come close (and it doesn't try), it is still an entertaining movie.Jakob Heym (Robin Williams) is a man living in one of the many Jewish ghettos of the time.  While outside the ghetto, he hears a newscast on the radio which tells him the Russians are about 400 kilometers away from his home there.  This starts a chain of events which lead the occupants of the ghetto to believe he has a radio hidden in his apartment, something which the Gestapo certainly frown upon.  This allows Jakob to bring hope to the inhabitants of such a dreary place.Despite the darkness of the events that this storyline revolves around, this movie still contains some humor.  Of course, with Robin Williams in it, we shouldn't expect any less.  As Jakob says, that was how we got by.  Williams is above average in this film, but that's not to say that this is his best work to date.  He is supported by an excellent cast, who are good in their roles, especially young Hannah Taylor-Gordon in the role of Lina.What brought this film down a couple of notches for me was the ending, which you will see when you watch it.

The best film about the Holocaust by far was Schindler's List, and I don't think that any film will be able to top that one.  While this one doesn't come close (and it doesn't try), it is still an entertaining movie.Jakob Heym (Robin Williams) is a man living in one of the many Jewish ghettos of the time.  While outside the ghetto, he hears a newscast on the radio which tells him the Russians are about 400 kilometers away from his home there.  This starts a chain of events which lead the occupants of the ghetto to believe he has a radio hidden in his apartment, something which the Gestapo certainly frown upon.  This allows Jakob to bring hope to the inhabitants of such a dreary place.Despite the darkness of the events that this storyline revolves around, this movie still contains some humor.

Those two were ultra-serious roles for him and to forray into comedy was perfect. It was a perfect role, perfect timing and a perfect opportunity to show people that he could play something other than the heavy or the bad guy. MY COUSIN VINNY is really just a distant cousin of his character in Goodfellas anyway.  Just imagine one of the guys in Goodfellas that didn't want to follow in the footsteps of the rest of the gangsters and this is him. Vinny is a foul mouthed, sometime violent, insecure but smart man.  He went to law school but took six attempts before he passed the bar.  They are definitely similar characters.  The difference is that Goodfellas was a serious film with a funny side and My Cousin Vinny is an absolutely hilarious film with a somewhat serious side.What makes the film work as well as it does, is many things.  First of all you have the fish out of water scenario with Vinny and his fiancee Lisa, wearing leather jackets and cowboy boots down in the south where it seems everyone is wearing overalls and they hang out in establishments where their best selling feature is chicken and pool.You also have a great supporting cast that features Lane Smith as a very animated D.A. that has to hammer home every point to his jury like they were morons.  He says the word truth is a word that comes down from England where all of our ancestors come, and looking at him incredulously is some of the black jury members.  Fred Gwynne supplies some of the best comedy for the film with his constant badgering of Vinny.  Everything from his suit, to his enunciation of words like youts, to his court room impropriety to his just plain dislike of him.  Gwynne and Pesci are so opposite as people. Gwynne being a giant of a man with a southern drawl and a long, virile face while Pesci is a short man with a distinct New Yawk slur and a pudgy, baby looking face.  They are complete opposites and much of the hilarity comes from their inability to see eye to eye on many things.It also has to said that Marisa Tomei is brilliant in this film.  There are people out there that try to demean her Oscar triumph that year because the favourite did not win like anticipated.  But her performance here is nothing short of Oscar worthy.  She is a gifted actress and her comedic timing in this film is bang on, or as she would say,  dead on balls accurate.

In any case, with Top Gun I have decided to be as to the point as possible. I won't talk about the story or it's characters too much because, I can't think of anyone who hasn't seen this film.Top Gun is one of those powerhouse films whose impact is unparalleled. It profits from repeat viewings and it's stylistic touches often take the breath away. Most go on to say that it's effects on the cinema screen enhance it's entertainment value by a a factor of 10. I wouldn't know; I was only 7 years old when it came out.But Top Gun is a more important film that it's ever been credit for. I say this because, to date it remains the defining achievement of the Bruckheimer\/ Simpson production team. This production team reshaped the face of the slick action film almost single-handedly. I would like to work the stretch and say that they almost created a new genre of film, but that would be pushing it. Today, all action films cannot survive without various essential components; handsome stars, pulsating soundtrack, powerful cinematography, new and inventive action shots, exotic locales.......Top Gun was the first on the scene to adequately and successfully combine all these elements into one film. It is a trendsetter and has, needless to say, inspired the production of thousands of other films. Top Gun is a film everybody knows, and it carries with it an incredible subliminal effect. I say this because, even if your not conscious of it, Top Gun and it's influence is consistently at play in the back of our minds when we talk about film. Almost any film!Today Bruckheimer (Simpson passed away 2 years ago) and his team are the paragons of this field. Most producers go unnoticed by the average audience; a huge number however, recognize and acknowledge Bruckheimer as a huge player and I can vouch for many who are just as eager to watch a Tom Cruise film as they are a Jerry Bruckheimer production. His influence is immense and this is all thanks to Top Gun being the revolutionary action film that is is.As with many of Tony Scott's films (Days of Thunder, Last Boy Scout, True Romance) this film is about a cocky sure-fire character who thinks he has all the answers until he gets a whiff of the real world and it's responsibilities and undergoes a major character change. He experiences various heartaches; from love and love lost to the loss of those dear to him, and he must overcome all this and find the strength to win the day and thereby prove his real mettle and evolution. This story has been used ad infinitum but in this case the hero-zero-hero story is so well complemented by the 80's slickness brought to the foreground by Bruckheimer\/ Simpson. Cruise should consider himself the world's most fortunate actor; Top Gun is one of the most important films of the 20th century and Tom Cruise was it's star. If the man did nothing else, he would have attained God-like status as an actor and continue to be lionized by an adoring public.Many film-makers will despise this film; it has made it near impossbile for small budget productions to make a deep impact. Sure there are a number that make it, but Top Gun ensured that lest an action flick carry a budget of over $100 million, it would never survive. That said, all the things that make the hairs stand on the back of our necks today have been inspired, to a large extent, from this film. Even the cinema trailers today need to pack a whopping punch to make the audience eager. If you notice, movie previews today, look like they cost as much as the actual film. This genre of film packs a lethal punch. Only the big fish can swim; the small will be devoured!!Make no mistake about it, Top Gun is a vital contribution to modern day cinema.

Struck by the Frank Mccourts life, by his struggle through extreme poverty--I belive this is a film anyone who is not afraid to view something more captivatiing then what they think their lives are like, should see. It made me think, these days, there are people who waste food, for instance. In this film, wasting food was considred a deadly sin. I was appaled by the conditions of his life. Before I used to throw away food, ill admit, but then I saw this, and never again had I thrown away so much food and things. There is not much charactar development, probably because its a true story, but the story itself is heart-felt, and insipring to watch this boy rise from the poverty of Old Ireland, to become a famous writer towards all. It truly shows us, just how much we should work hard and not be lazy, just how much we should NOT waste food and belongings, but most of all, it shows us that no matter how bad you think your life is, we should open our eyes, and look around, and not be so sellfish on ourselves.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"3 June 2000","score":"","review":"  I had put off watching this film for a long time.  I have always seen David Mamet as an excellent screenwriter and director, and I look forward to seeing what he has done for the upcoming Hannibal.  However, this film didn't seem to be one that would hold my interest.After finally viewing it, nothing could be further from the truth.  This is another of Mamet's excellent efforts.  I have always found Mamet's characters to be his strong point, and this is no exception.  His representation of the average working man is right on par.  This movie centers mainly on the characters, and not on outside events which they cannot control.  Each of the main characters in this film are responsible for their own actions, and they each decide their fate.  An excellent character study.Jack Lemmon shines in his role, as do Al Pacino and Kevin Spacey.  (In fact, Al Pacino was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.)  Of course, we can't expect anything else from these actors, as all have shown themselves to be highly regarded in dramatic roles.  Ed Harris makes a good showing, and Alec Baldwin is surprisingly effective as well.As I have mentioned in other reviews, I often like to be entertained while having to think about a film at the same time.  This film allows for this.  However, while this is an excellent Mamet film, it's not his best.  For one of his best in my opinion, have a look at Homicide, but don't let young children watch it because of the excessive (but still not overdone) coarse language.My Rating  8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"3 June 2000","score":"","review":"  I had put off watching this film for a long time.
