How could a title and premise that simultaneously stupid and generic be anything more than the sum of its exorbitantly familiar parts? It doesn't help that every plot summary reads roughly exactly how you'd expect it to; even stray quotations out of context play like recycled outtakes from American Pie. If anything, it seems amazing how barefaced the film is about its complete unoriginality. So do yourself a favour &#x96; stop reading plot summaries, perusing online quotes, and just go see the film instead. Don't watch the trailer. Even stop reading this review. Stop it. Please stop.What are you doing still reading? I asked you nicely and everything! &#x85;I have failed at my objective.The inevitable twist, of course all of the above claims are actually true. And yet, somehow, Wet Hot American Summer remains an almost uncomfortably enjoyable watch. This is a film that gleefully tries to hide how far-removed from the film you think it's going to be, patiently wearing the mask of a normal 'Murrcan teenage coming-of-age camp drama, filled with first kisses, first times, illicit substances, and plenty of second-hand embarrassment. Don't get me wrong those things are all still there. But the schmaltz of the standard framework has been jettisoned for something altogether livelier, funnier, and even more honest. 'Parody' is the term used to encompass the film's approach to genre, but it may as well function as a parody of expectations of normal narrative beats and cohesion. It's almost as if writer\/director David Wain and writer\/star Michael Showalter have tossed a pinch of magic (or at least 'special sauce') into the pressure cooker of rote garbage and let it rip with no lid, exploding everywhere in a mess too delicious to be turned down (or something&#x85; I think that metaphor got away from me). The best joke of all? It works. Weirdly well. No, this is a film whose heart and inspiration lies somewhere between the SNL-spin off insanity of Meatballs and National Lampoon, blended with a healthy helping of the surrealistic insanity of Monty Python, and culminating in just enough heartfelt personal experience to feel strangely honest, in spite of the trappings. Narratively, it plays like a collection of improv sketches with only a rough template to eventually veer back to &#x96; an Anchorman before Anchorman, if you will. Wain and Showalter take as much pleasure in making you fall in love with their earnest, archetypal characters, as they do pulling the rug out from what you would traditionally expect or even want to happen to them. Zaniness abounds, but somehow, by pushing the tropes to hyperbolic, with a side helping of irreverent and insane, ye olde teenage love subplot clichés feel far more heartfelt and credible than they would in the far flashier and stupider films that birthed them. Like any good comedy, this is a film that establishes its own internal world of conventions and possibilities. Yes, this is a world where Paul Rudd, upon finding out that, due to his negligence as a lifeguard, one of his campers has drowned, responds by offhandedly disposing of the witness&#x85; and we're expected to laugh. And if laugh you do, the film's got another one for ya. Some of the bits are shrewder satirical genius (the into town sequence hysterically lampoons every parent's stern lectures about the escalation of substance use), but the film steadily gives in to being willfully deranged, building to a finale so ridiculous it feels like the apex of a drug trip&#x85;and, thus, entirely appropriate. In many ways, the film's biggest gag is its oddly prophetic assembly of actors who would go on to become comedic superstars, and an extra level of hilarity is derived from watching them irreverently having a blast here. Rudd steals the show, exquisitely uncompromising as the camp's resident pretty-boy-dirtbag, but Amy Poehler is a close second, perfecting her routine personas as both earnestly inspirational and ferocious control freak. Bradley 'blink-and-you- might-recognize-him' Cooper, of all people, ends up headlining a romantic subplot that leads to the most unexpectedly tender moments of the film, while Christopher Meloni unabashedly steals every scene he appears in, a comedic triumph as the camp's shellshocked cook. Janeanne Garofalo and David Hyde-Pierce are both brilliantly in their element, blending sardonic barbs and rambling sweetness, as the camp's director and resident astrophysicist respectively, while Showalter himself is adorably fumbling as the lovestruck nerd (alongside a surprise cameo appearance) and Marguerite Moreau delivers some of the film's most incredibly acerbic dialogue while impressively never dropping her beaming smile. Molly Shannon uncorks a hysterically belligerent meltdown like none other, and Elizabeth Banks is hilariously dopey as one of the camp's seemingly endless slew of nymphomaniacs (go figure). Comedy this bonkers is certainly not for all tastes, but it's worth at least conceding which tastes the film should appeal to, which the film's latent cult success should attest to. Ultimately, in Wet Hot American Summer, coherence doesn't really matter like an appropriately wild party, by the end of the film, it's hard to remember who was involved in which subplot, and who's kissed who, until you realize it hardly matters, and to just go along with the ride, and leave with Jefferson Starship's Jane still pounding in your head.

This is a film that gleefully tries to hide how far-removed from the film you think it's going to be, patiently wearing the mask of a normal 'Murrcan teenage coming-of-age camp drama, filled with first kisses, first times, illicit substances, and plenty of second-hand embarrassment. Don't get me wrong those things are all still there. But the schmaltz of the standard framework has been jettisoned for something altogether livelier, funnier, and even more honest. 'Parody' is the term used to encompass the film's approach to genre, but it may as well function as a parody of expectations of normal narrative beats and cohesion. It's almost as if writer\/director David Wain and writer\/star Michael Showalter have tossed a pinch of magic (or at least 'special sauce') into the pressure cooker of rote garbage and let it rip with no lid, exploding everywhere in a mess too delicious to be turned down (or something&#x85; I think that metaphor got away from me). The best joke of all? It works. Weirdly well. No, this is a film whose heart and inspiration lies somewhere between the SNL-spin off insanity of Meatballs and National Lampoon, blended with a healthy helping of the surrealistic insanity of Monty Python, and culminating in just enough heartfelt personal experience to feel strangely honest, in spite of the trappings. Narratively, it plays like a collection of improv sketches with only a rough template to eventually veer back to &#x96; an Anchorman before Anchorman, if you will. Wain and Showalter take as much pleasure in making you fall in love with their earnest, archetypal characters, as they do pulling the rug out from what you would traditionally expect or even want to happen to them. Zaniness abounds, but somehow, by pushing the tropes to hyperbolic, with a side helping of irreverent and insane, ye olde teenage love subplot clichés feel far more heartfelt and credible than they would in the far flashier and stupider films that birthed them. Like any good comedy, this is a film that establishes its own internal world of conventions and possibilities. Yes, this is a world where Paul Rudd, upon finding out that, due to his negligence as a lifeguard, one of his campers has drowned, responds by offhandedly disposing of the witness&#x85; and we're expected to laugh. And if laugh you do, the film's got another one for ya. Some of the bits are shrewder satirical genius (the into town sequence hysterically lampoons every parent's stern lectures about the escalation of substance use), but the film steadily gives in to being willfully deranged, building to a finale so ridiculous it feels like the apex of a drug trip&#x85;and, thus, entirely appropriate. In many ways, the film's biggest gag is its oddly prophetic assembly of actors who would go on to become comedic superstars, and an extra level of hilarity is derived from watching them irreverently having a blast here. Rudd steals the show, exquisitely uncompromising as the camp's resident pretty-boy-dirtbag, but Amy Poehler is a close second, perfecting her routine personas as both earnestly inspirational and ferocious control freak. Bradley 'blink-and-you- might-recognize-him' Cooper, of all people, ends up headlining a romantic subplot that leads to the most unexpectedly tender moments of the film, while Christopher Meloni unabashedly steals every scene he appears in, a comedic triumph as the camp's shellshocked cook. Janeanne Garofalo and David Hyde-Pierce are both brilliantly in their element, blending sardonic barbs and rambling sweetness, as the camp's director and resident astrophysicist respectively, while Showalter himself is adorably fumbling as the lovestruck nerd (alongside a surprise cameo appearance) and Marguerite Moreau delivers some of the film's most incredibly acerbic dialogue while impressively never dropping her beaming smile. Molly Shannon uncorks a hysterically belligerent meltdown like none other, and Elizabeth Banks is hilariously dopey as one of the camp's seemingly endless slew of nymphomaniacs (go figure). Comedy this bonkers is certainly not for all tastes, but it's worth at least conceding which tastes the film should appeal to, which the film's latent cult success should attest to. Ultimately, in Wet Hot American Summer, coherence doesn't really matter like an appropriately wild party, by the end of the film, it's hard to remember who was involved in which subplot, and who's kissed who, until you realize it hardly matters, and to just go along with the ride, and leave with Jefferson Starship's Jane still pounding in your head. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go hump the refrigerator. -8\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"28 July 2015","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This movie could have been a lot better, it's premise is great (asteroid on course to strike earth, mission sent to destroy asteroid fails, only very few people on Earth are selected to live on after the asteroid hits, leaving the rest to die a horrible death BUT they have many months before this happens so they must all still live together and wait for the inevitable) but what was needed to make it fulfil it's potential is completely missing.The aim of this movie is to make you care about the characters and make almost every scene in the second half either a tearjerker or a philosophical eye opener.

However, upon finding that sadistic outlaw Stacey Bridges and his two cousins have been released from prison, the townspeople decide to appease the stranger in the hope he will protect them from the three gunmen. The stranger agrees before setting himself up as a king amongst the townsfolk, who are unaware of the dark surprise he has in store for them. The townspeople soon find themselves turning against one another and tensions reach boiling point after some of their number try to kill the stranger. Meanwhile the three outlaws are fast approaching Lago, but why does the stranger bear an eerie resemblance to the town's sheriff whom they brutally whipped to death in the town's street a year previous...Clint Eastwood's second foray into directing(after the chilling Play Misty For Me), High Plains Drifter is a ghoulishly symbolic nightmare with pinches of extramundane mysticism. Despite being gorgeously existential, the movie is an ode to the Dollars trilogy and it is evident that Clint drew a lot on his association with Sergio Leone, which is why I define High Plains Drifter as a pseudo-spaghetti western. Clint was awesome as the nameless stranger, playing the part with the awe-striking, cool-headed professionalism that he crafted so masterfully as the Man With No Name. Unlike most (American) westerns, High Plains Drifter has no heroes, just villains. Let me begin by saying that the film is beautifully metaphoric in it's depiction of guilt. It is a study of the our dark side as individuals and the conscience that terrifies us so when we do something wrong, the voice in our heads that keeps us awake at night warning us that someday, we'll get what we deserve. Even those of us who claim to fear nothing at least fear their own conscience and this is cleverly represented in the movie. The stranger is this immortal being whose unyielding objective is to punish the people of Lago(and the three outlaws)for their wrongdoing. It transpires that the locals hired the trio of killers to viciously whip the stranger(formally the sheriff of Lago, Jim Duncan)to death a year before after he found that their mine was on government property. Anyway, on the surface the stranger symbolises the severe guilt felt by the townsfolk for condoning this heinous act. The three outlaws are also symbols of this burden carried by the locals as they went to prison for committing out the murder and thus are seeking violent retribution on the people upon their release. The stranger's arrival in the town highlights the sins of the townsfolk returning to haunt them, as does the outlaw's climatic attack on Lago. On the other hand, the townsfolk symbolise the evil of ordinary people who may appear righteous but deep down, are repulsively corrupt. This is an evil that indeed doesn't go unnoticed and will be dealt with, as is the case in the film. Many will make of the film's symbolism differently, but that's just my ten pence worth. High Plains Drifter featured top notch performances all round. Verna Bloom and Marianna Hill were both fantastic, as was Geoffrey Lewis as the savage Bridges.

","genre":null},{"date":"28 July 2015","score":"","review":" When a mysterious stranger(Clint Eastwood)rides into the sleepy town of Lago, his presence is met with extreme anxiety by the townsfolk. However, upon finding that sadistic outlaw Stacey Bridges and his two cousins have been released from prison, the townspeople decide to appease the stranger in the hope he will protect them from the three gunmen. The stranger agrees before setting himself up as a king amongst the townsfolk, who are unaware of the dark surprise he has in store for them. The townspeople soon find themselves turning against one another and tensions reach boiling point after some of their number try to kill the stranger. Meanwhile the three outlaws are fast approaching Lago, but why does the stranger bear an eerie resemblance to the town's sheriff whom they brutally whipped to death in the town's street a year previous...Clint Eastwood's second foray into directing(after the chilling Play Misty For Me), High Plains Drifter is a ghoulishly symbolic nightmare with pinches of extramundane mysticism. Despite being gorgeously existential, the movie is an ode to the Dollars trilogy and it is evident that Clint drew a lot on his association with Sergio Leone, which is why I define High Plains Drifter as a pseudo-spaghetti western. Clint was awesome as the nameless stranger, playing the part with the awe-striking, cool-headed professionalism that he crafted so masterfully as the Man With No Name. Unlike most (American) westerns, High Plains Drifter has no heroes, just villains. Let me begin by saying that the film is beautifully metaphoric in it's depiction of guilt. It is a study of the our dark side as individuals and the conscience that terrifies us so when we do something wrong, the voice in our heads that keeps us awake at night warning us that someday, we'll get what we deserve. Even those of us who claim to fear nothing at least fear their own conscience and this is cleverly represented in the movie. The stranger is this immortal being whose unyielding objective is to punish the people of Lago(and the three outlaws)for their wrongdoing. It transpires that the locals hired the trio of killers to viciously whip the stranger(formally the sheriff of Lago, Jim Duncan)to death a year before after he found that their mine was on government property. Anyway, on the surface the stranger symbolises the severe guilt felt by the townsfolk for condoning this heinous act. The three outlaws are also symbols of this burden carried by the locals as they went to prison for committing out the murder and thus are seeking violent retribution on the people upon their release. The stranger's arrival in the town highlights the sins of the townsfolk returning to haunt them, as does the outlaw's climatic attack on Lago. On the other hand, the townsfolk symbolise the evil of ordinary people who may appear righteous but deep down, are repulsively corrupt. This is an evil that indeed doesn't go unnoticed and will be dealt with, as is the case in the film. Many will make of the film's symbolism differently, but that's just my ten pence worth. High Plains Drifter featured top notch performances all round. Verna Bloom and Marianna Hill were both fantastic, as was Geoffrey Lewis as the savage Bridges.

Despite being a box office hit on its release, the reviews were largely mediocre and, reading them in retrospect, fairly on target. With the Ed Helms reboot coming out, I decided to catch it again as an adult, and I must say that the rose-colored glasses of nostalgic sentiment coupled with the gaggle of increasingly dreadful sequels, give the original Vacation a reputation of hilarity that it simply does not live up to. In fact, it has aged badly.The simple story centers on the Griswold family (dad Chevy Chase, mom Beverly D'Angelo and siblings Anthony Michael Hall and Dana Barron) and their disaster plagued cross country road trip to Wally World. Pretty much everyone can relate to family trips, especially from childhood, that went horribly awry, which should give Vacation fertile ground to mine. Unfortunately, it too often misses the mark and ultimately wears out its welcome long before we reach the final destination.On the plus side, the film has a fun postcards opening credits sequence paired with Lindsay Buckingham's rousing Holiday Road. Then it starts to deteriorate. A huge problem rests with the central character of Clark Griswold and the performance by Chase. Anyone is sympathetic with well-intentioned travel plans that blow up due to circumstances beyond one's control (i.e., bad accommodations, car trouble, nasty relatives, unplanned side trips, weather, etc.) and can laugh about them after the fact. Much of this should be the focus of the comedy, but very little of these are exploited in this film. Instead, the film takes the low road and too many of the comical moments stem from Clark being a complete imbecile. He makes choices and has reactions that few, if any, sane human beings would. To make matters worse, he is also a rather mean-spirited jerk. We can laugh and be sympathetic with a likable well-meaning guy of average intelligence running into vacation road blocks beyond his control, but it becomes less funny when the guy is actually a fairly unlikable jerk whose foolishness is often the starting point of the problems.Also, a number of the jokes are simply not that funny and the side trips and subplots often seem little more than padding. The film also has its fair share of mean-spiritedness, which sours any good humor. Christie Brinkley makes several appearances as a hottie in a sportscar who keeps ostentatiously flirting with Chase on the road. Overlooking the fact that one cannot fathom why someone who looks like Brinkley would be wasting her time relentlessly trying to seduce a shlub like Clark with his wife sitting in full view in the passenger seat, what kind of jerk would unabashedly leer back with his rather lovely significant other present. This all culminates in a hotel swimming pool sequence that goes no where, other than to allow son Hall to give Chase a reverse father doesn't know best pep talk that rings hollow.A side trip to visit redneck relatives, led by a criminally unfunny Randy Quaid, is fairly laughless and seems present only to pad time and saddle the Griswolds with a hated aunt (Imogene Coca) and her dog. This could have been funny, but the film is so mean-spirited that instead of some great verbal banter between comedy legend Coca and Chase (and company), we instead end up with Chase murdering her dog by tying it to the bumper and dragging it to death and then precipitating Coca's fatal heart attack and then leaving her cadaver on her son's front stoop with a note. Oh the hilarity! This might be understandable if the aunt were a character of great villainy, but other than being mildly unpleasant, she does nothing to generate this level of malevolence towards her. If there is anyone in the audience that can relate to vacation memories like this, then I suggest you move quickly away from them and make for the exits.Chase's performance clumsily lurches between abject stupidity and meanness. D'Angelo, stuck in the stereotypical long-suffering wife straight man role (are there any other kinds in these comedies), acquits herself well despite having so few notes to play. Hall keeps trying to find something to do with his role long after the writers have given up. He has it made compared to Barron, who only gets a few reaction shots and nothing funny. Apparently, women need to play it straight and only guys can be funny. Coca seems game, but she is only on hand for a nasty gag at her expense.By the time the Griswolds do get to Wally World, the viewer is exhausted and not from laughing. The film has long since run out of gas. It has seemed like an endless trip and shortly after departure has ceased to resemble anything like a funny disastrous road trip that friends or family would regale you with. Truly, at least 20 minutes or so could be cut from the film to its benefit.

If there is anyone in the audience that can relate to vacation memories like this, then I suggest you move quickly away from them and make for the exits.Chase's performance clumsily lurches between abject stupidity and meanness. D'Angelo, stuck in the stereotypical long-suffering wife straight man role (are there any other kinds in these comedies), acquits herself well despite having so few notes to play. Hall keeps trying to find something to do with his role long after the writers have given up. He has it made compared to Barron, who only gets a few reaction shots and nothing funny. Apparently, women need to play it straight and only guys can be funny. Coca seems game, but she is only on hand for a nasty gag at her expense.By the time the Griswolds do get to Wally World, the viewer is exhausted and not from laughing. The film has long since run out of gas. It has seemed like an endless trip and shortly after departure has ceased to resemble anything like a funny disastrous road trip that friends or family would regale you with. Truly, at least 20 minutes or so could be cut from the film to its benefit. This mediocre film was followed by the even worse European Vacation and Vegas Vacation, and a barely tolerable step up from those with Christmas Vacation.

Excellent. ","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Fantasy"},{"date":"28 July 2015","score":"","review":" I can't believe its been 30 years since this film was released. A little girl is forced to grow up very quickly when her little brother is taken and at risk of being turned into a Goblin, but the sets made (by M.C. Escher), the puppets (from Jim Henson) the romance between Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) and the Goblin King (David Bowie), was just magical. A modern day version of this film would just have used CGI but its nostalgic and wonderful to see real puppets in action in a kids film. I am sure any child of the time imagined themselves running around in that maze avoiding the challenges set and having such companions as Hoggle, Ludo and Ambrocious (that last name makes me think of Ambrosia Rice Pudding for some reason). David Bowie as the Goblin King though, I'm sure he had all the girls falling at his feet he had power, mystery and I guess for the ladies looks. Labyinth is just a truly magical film a fairytale with puppets and actors instead of animation or CGI. All I can say is RIP Jim Henson, you and your puppets are truly missed, they brought to life many a legend of film and television drama.
