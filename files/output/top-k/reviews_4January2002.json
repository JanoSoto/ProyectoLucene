Up until this film's release last summer, full-length computer animated feature films had been thought of as strictly kids fare; they were marketed for them and their slant toward light entertainment was apparent in the films' bright colors and jokey characters (let it be known that films such as Toy Story and Shrek were great films regardless).  But the producers of Final Fantasy clearly had the forethought to use modern-day technology to tell a ponderous, more mature tale that had not been done previously in computer animation.  In this sense, Final Fantasy represents a new breed among its kind.  I envision that eventually we will see more and more computer animated films aimed at an older age demographic than they are currently.  However, with the poor box office this film received (which resulted in the complete shut down of Columbia and Square Pictures' computer animation department), it seems as if people such as myself who anxiously await to see what lies ahead in the ever-evolving computer animation feature film market will have to wait longer than previously hoped for.  Therefore, Final Fantasy will be one-of-a-kind for a while, even though, disappointingly, when one compares it to live-action films of its type, it is definitely not in a league by itself.  It does not contain an original idea in its entire 106 minute running time.  From the aliens impregnating one's body, to a devastatingly demolished future New York City, to the sacrificial token black character, it has all been done before.  Incoherent and cliched story-telling is the film's achilles heel.  Yet, unlike, say, The Fifth Element, at least the film attempts to be dramatic with its characters - their emotion is genuine.  And the film at least tries to distill a moral.  No matter, as the animation is truly on another level.  While lip-synching and body movement still needs to be improved, when the characters are still, they are a work of art.  Besides, after the initial shock that, yes, I am actually watching a complex combination of ones and zeros do THAT (even though occasionally it seems slightly off), that effect wears off and the film itself takes precedence.  It is just a shame that we will not see for some time how the film makers would have or will take the groundwork laid in this picture and attempt to further it.

The heist genre has been heavily sown over the years, so it is difficult to come up with a truly fresh storyline.  Still, there have been so many bad heist films that to see one of this caliber is a treat. Robert DeNiro plays Nick, a thief who wants to do one big job to get out of the business.  Marlon Brando is Max, the fence who brings Nick together with Jack (Edward Norton), the inside man who conceived the job.  This standard setup is far from original and is a staple of this type of film.  What makes it excel is the way it unfolds.  Director Frank Oz, steps out from his outstanding career with the Muppets to take on a completely different type of project, performing quite admirably.  Oz unwinds the tale deliberately, taking time to develop relationships and motivations usually missing from heist flicks.  The result is an extremely believable yarn with characters whose behavior is consistent with motivations revealed throughout the film.The story, which is a collaborative effort by four writers of little renown, is very tight.  They do a good job of creating a story that evolves effectively, adapting ingeniously to each little wrinkle they introduce.  While the probability of a double cross is pretty transparent, the ending twists a couple of times, first giving the viewer what he has been set up to expect and then delivering the unexpected.  That is good storytelling.The acting is uniformly good from a cast of accomplished actors.  DeNiro doesn't break any new ground with this character, but Nick is so familiar to him that he can't help but deliver a terrific portrayal.  This may not be a career performance for DeNiro, but there are few actors I can think of who could have played this character any better.  Marlon Brando is a legend, of course, but he has not done anything of consequence since `Apocalypse Now' (1979).  Even that was a kind of grotesquely twisted character that came nowhere near some of his great performances starting with `A Streetcar Named Desire' (1951) through `Godfather' (1972).  This is the first film I have seen him in since 1979 that shows a glimmer of his true acting ability.  Though it is a small role, Brando interprets the character with subtle undertones and a raw power that we haven't seen from him in many years.The new kid on the block (by comparison), but no less talented is Edward Norton.  I have been impressed by Norton's audacious style with each new film he has made.  Once again he adds to his range with this film, delivering a fantastic imitation of a palsied man as a cover for his inside work.  However, this is only a footnote to an otherwise powerful performance.  He conjures a seething arrogance and cunning resolve in a character determined to show the old timers how he is really the best and smartest of them all.  This is a fine addition to a growing resume of Norton's exceptional performances.Though Angela Bassett's character is really superfluous, I must give her credit for an excellent job.  Bassett infuses great emotion and sincerity into a character that is little more than a motivational point of reference for Nick's behavior.  Still, she plays every scene flat out, making the most of a limited opportunity.I was very impressed with this film on a number of levels.  I rated it a 9\/10 on the strength of how it compares with the genre.  Even taken in a broader context, I would give it a 7\/10 or 8\/10 because it is such good filmmaking.  Though a bit slow for the action junkie, it is an engaging film with plenty of entertainment value.

Veteran stars Gene Hackman, Angelica Huston, and Billy Crystal, supported by proved stars Gwenyth Paltrow and Ben Stiller, cannot spark enough on screen chemistry to carry this eccentric film. Wonderfully narrated by Alec Baldwin, the film commences by introducing us to the Tenebaum family. Far from being Royal, the three children, played by Paltrow, stiller and up and coming Luke Wilson, apparently were heralded as geniuses and enjoyed notability in their youth. Baldwin narrates the ups and downs of the children's lives, but the film doesn't fully take form until the three thirty-something children end up living back at home. Hackman plays Royal, the patriarch of a family he abandoned long ago. Finding himself broke and homeless as well as wanting to prevent his wife (they have been separated for years, but never divorced) form marrying her accountant (Danny Glover), Royal feigns illness and moves back into Tenenbaum home. The film's best asset is that Paltrow shines in her role as Margot, the adopted daughter and once known play write. This movie was as tab for Paltrow to establish herself as a serious actress, one with range, poise and intelligence. She won the Oscar race against Cate Blanchette, but hasn't made the careful choices Blanchette has made, and effectively Paltrow has become a more mainstream Hollywood celebrity. In this role, she demonstrates the range and composure that won her the Oscar for Shakespeare in Love. We forget about her performance in this summer's dismal Shallow Hal, and she truly makes us believe that a film with her name on it should be worth the view. In fact, the acting in the film was superb throughout the film. And why wouldn't it be with such an accomplished cast? Unfortunately, the chemistry between the characters in the play didn't mix. Each actor played his or her part extremely well, but these eclectic characters proved too eclectic for one another. The relationships were not believable, and the film lacked any fluidity. Aside from a few rather funny segments, the audience fidgeted and checked their watches. Even the laugh out loud parts of the film were a detriment to the overall film. They only prove how hilarious the movie could have been. The film was full of `could have beens.' With such incredible potential, the film crashes and burns. Its quirkiness and often clever humor remind us of director Wes Anderson's other films Rushmore and Bottle Rocket, but the originality of those two movies is not apparent in Tenebaums. The movie, presented like a book, and feeling like a play, drones one slowly, with subtle humour and often too clever jokes that mainstream audiences miss. Though at times enjoyable, the film fizzles and the when the credits finally rolled, the audience gave a sigh of relief.

Veteran stars Gene Hackman, Angelica Huston, and Billy Crystal, supported by proved stars Gwenyth Paltrow and Ben Stiller, cannot spark enough on screen chemistry to carry this eccentric film. Wonderfully narrated by Alec Baldwin, the film commences by introducing us to the Tenebaum family. Far from being Royal, the three children, played by Paltrow, stiller and up and coming Luke Wilson, apparently were heralded as geniuses and enjoyed notability in their youth. Baldwin narrates the ups and downs of the children's lives, but the film doesn't fully take form until the three thirty-something children end up living back at home.

Mulholland Falls doesn't have a plot as such, but it begins with what initially promises to be an intriguing mystery. A mysterious brunette (Laura Elena Harring) suffering from amnesia turns up in the apartment where bright-eyed wannabe starlet Betty (Naomi Watts) is preparing to launch her Hollywood career. The two subsequently embark on a mysterious and puzzling journey to discover the identity of the woman (now calling herself Rita). At the same time, top Hollywood director Adam (Justin Theroux - American Psycho) is being pressured into casting an unknown actress in his new movie by mysterious and threatening movie moguls. At first he refuses, but finds that the power of the faceless overlords is disturbingly persuasive. Sound promising? Well it's a wonderfully directed film noir with great dialogue and Lynch's eye for the terror lurking behind the mundane hasn't been this sharp since Blue Velvet. However, half way through the movie, and with an intriguing solution in sight, Lynch decides to tear-up the characters and plot to take us in a completely different direction. This would be fine if the new plot line bore any resemblance to the previous. Instead the viewer has wasted over an hour becoming embroiled in a mystery which Lynch has no intention of resolving. Some people call that daring, others call it infuriating. It seems Lynch was preoccupied with being mysterious. As a result many people who don't understand what the hell's happening would rather applaud than admit to being baffled. The nub of the flick rests on Lynch's attempt to show the audience the thin line between reality and fantasy by making them as unsure of what's real as the characters. However, where The Usual Suspects left audiences in awe at the revelation, viewers of Mulholland Drive will simply feel cheated - assuming they can understand what on earth's going on. It's hard not to admire Lynch's brilliant eye for the atmospheric and the surreal, but this makes the way he destroys the film so much more irritating. The sad truth is that it'll still be better than 80 per cent of cinematic releases this year, but really, if he could only keep his head out of his arse, Lynch might see that he's too talented to waste his time trying to be enigmatic.

Most people would say no, because most people have chosen a favorite already and are hesitant to stray from that conviction. Shawshank Redemption is a common, and wholly deserved, choice for many. While I also hesitate to say this is the best film ever, I can say this I am hard pressed to think of a better one. There are several films which stand on the same level (Shawshank, The Empire Strikes Back, etc.) but none that I can think of which are clear and away better than Rings. It is unquestionably the best work in the (admittedly small) genre, but this is insufficient praise when you consider that it competes with Dungeons & Dragons, Mortal Kombat, and Krull for that honor.So praise goes to the individuals that made this film the triumph that it is. First, to Ian McKellen for covering the entire range of Gandalf, from the playful hobbit-friend to the imposing and powerful wizard. To Elijah Wood, for his best turn yet as Frodo. All four of the hobbits, indeed, captured the comfort-loving and adventure-wary attitude of Tolkien's hobbits perfectly. To Viggo Mortensen, who literally lived in his armor to capture the essence of Aragorn. To Christopher Lee, a long-overdue helping of praise for his portrayal of Saruman (his recitation of the power of Sauron's eye is just chilling). To John Rhys-Davies, not nearly as underdeveloped as Gimli as some would say. He just fit to character, never letting us forget the temperament of a dwarf.

He had the vision to reshape Tolkien's story just enough to make it a masterpiece of cinema - the removal of Tom Bombadil was ideal, he being the character in Fellowship least connected to the rest of the story, who comes and goes and leaves the characters more or less unchanged, and the barrow-wights, which was so forgettable a portion of the book that I scarcely remember it. Also he had the temperance to leave the most important aspects of the story unchanged, such as the encounter with the Balrog (listen to Ian McKellen say that word in the movie. Classic!) and the Lady of the Wood.The film is littered with the details of Tolkien's Middle Earth, and makes perfect sense to one outside the fandom - I had not read the novels until after I had seen the movie twice. I don't think it's crystal clear to some people that this is the first of three; a few people in my theater who were in shock when it ended with so little resolved, but that's a minor grievance and hopefully that information will spread faster than the film.

Many of the seamless conversations and events of the film were acted in front of a blue screen, with characters interacting with wooden posts and the like. All is flawless on screen.And most of all praise goes to Peter Jackson, an admitted fan of the trilogy. He had the vision to reshape Tolkien's story just enough to make it a masterpiece of cinema - the removal of Tom Bombadil was ideal, he being the character in Fellowship least connected to the rest of the story, who comes and goes and leaves the characters more or less unchanged, and the barrow-wights, which was so forgettable a portion of the book that I scarcely remember it. Also he had the temperance to leave the most important aspects of the story unchanged, such as the encounter with the Balrog (listen to Ian McKellen say that word in the movie. Classic!) and the Lady of the Wood.The film is littered with the details of Tolkien's Middle Earth, and makes perfect sense to one outside the fandom - I had not read the novels until after I had seen the movie twice. I don't think it's crystal clear to some people that this is the first of three; a few people in my theater who were in shock when it ended with so little resolved, but that's a minor grievance and hopefully that information will spread faster than the film. Of course, that's a pretty tall order with a film like this.

For children there are some fart jokes and plenty of cat and dog slapstick but there are almost no jokes for adults that other films such as Shrek and Toy Story had in spades.Given the cast this is very surprising - Jon Lovitz is a great voice but is hardly used at all, the character of Mr Tinkles could have been a great Dr Evil character, but even he is wasted.  This is a great shame as all good children's films need to have something for adults to enjoy again.  The great cast (Maguire, Baldwin, Clarke Duncan, Sarandon, Pantoliano, Charlton Heston, Lovitz) is a good draw for adults but having almost nothing to deliver for them is a big disappointment.

Not only is the animation far more polished & detailed than its earlier predecessors, A Grand Day Out (1992) and The Wrong Trousers ('93). But in addition the story is far more engaging, light & humourous compared to the darker more mechanical nature of TWT (my least favourite of the three).For the first time, A Close Shave introduces an extra dimension to the W&G pairing, in the form of Wendolene, a lady woolshop owner who Wallace falls in love with when both he & Gromit clean her shop windows.With the addition of a female into the story we are given a little more character development concerning Wallace. The previous two stories only centred around his self-serving interests in cheese, inventions, making money and relying on his pet pooch to get him out of sticky situations. But in ACS we are offered a more rounded perspective of his personal life and his keeness to have a woman sharing his home at long last.As the film progresses the relationship between the couple grows, in spite of all the dangers & hazards that they face along the way. And by the end of the film we are left on tenterhooks as to whether Wendolene will finally move in with W&G for good!So not only is the animation and attention to detail significantly improved over TWT but so too is the characterisation and storyline. The voice of Wallace, Peter Sallis, is dependable & easy on the ear, even though he doesn't have much to say compared to the previous films.But it is to Gromit where the real plaudits lie. Because he can't speak (or bark apparently!) we have to rely on his facial expression to understand how he feels & reacts to those around him. Because of the wonderful attention to animated detail Nick Park and his crew have spent, we can connect & relate very easily to Gromit's body language, especially within his eyes. I don't think I've ever seen such wonderful expressions since Laurel & Hardy. In fact the next time you have the benefit of seeing a L&H film take note of Ollie's facial expressions to-camera and you'll understand the comparison between him & Gromit.Its now 6 years since the last W&G installment and it is to be hoped that Nick Park will do another follow up. I only hope he doesn't rely on lifeless cgi for his animation technique. On average it took NP between 2 to 3 years for each of the W&G episodes. But it was worth the wait. However, the Dreamworks Studio to which NP is affiliated, may not like having to wait such a long time for the next installment to be made, a may insist on using computer animation rather than clay to speed the production process up somewhat.Chicken Run (2000), NP's first full-feature movie in conjunction with Dreamworks was, on the whole, ok. But the story seemed so formulaic & safe that you just knew the studio had influenced the production more than NP would have liked. And as a result you get a bland film built on hype. So I only hope the next W&G doesn't follow the same route otherwise the entire W&G franchise will be ruined for the sake of the mighty dollar yet again.****\/*****  ","genre":null},{"date":"4 January 2002","score":"14 out of 17 people found the following review useful","review":"  Of all the W&G films A Close Shave is by far the best of all.

I felt the terror of their flight from the Nazgul, all the way from the Shire to Rivendell.  I was dazzled by the whole Moria sequence, and while action scenes usually don't do much for me, this time they did because I CARED.  My heart was in my throat every time they were in danger (which was most of the time!).  And, most acutely, I felt their sadness after Moria and particularly Frodo's sadness for the remainder of the movie.One thing that really impressed me was the REALISM of the movie.  The characters are often dirty, sweating and\/or bedraggled.  They don't always look attractive.  The realism throughout is part of what swept me up and brought me into another world for 3 hours.I was moved by the heroism of many of the characters Aragorn, putting his life on the line over and over again to protect Frodo; Gandalf, at the bridge at kazud-dum; Merry and Pippin, drawing off the orcs to let Frodo get to the boats; Sam, for his steadfast loyalty in the face of any and all danger; Boromir, in his final redemption; Legolas, for his sheer prowess in battle (he was a joy to watch).  Gimli seemed to get short-changed in this film; perhaps his time will come in the next one.  But mostly I was moved by Frodo.  So terrified in the first half of the movie and so sad in the second half, he nonetheless carries on with his against-all-odds quest, taking the road he knows to be right when there are many easier (but false) roads that could be taken.  His moment comes when he gets in that boat and pushes off.There were a few scenes I didn't care for, or that I thought should have been done differently, but they are minor quibbles and I won't go into them. This movie works on every level.  I have never loved a movie so much as this one.And as for those books I barely managed to struggle through ten years ago? After the movie, I ripped through them all in less than five days, hanging on every word.  I wanted to know exactly what happened, and I couldn't bear to wait two years to find out.  The movie made me care about the characters, and that makes all the difference in the world.10\/10, and then some.  Bring on Two Towers!  How will I ever manage to wait a whole year?

I never liked comparing films to the medium they came from, just judge them on their own merit. So with that in mind, LOTR-TFOTR is okay, not great by any stretch. It's basically a 3-hour chase and fight scene movie, with a few moments of character development thrown in here and there. And at 3-hours of running and fighting, that gets to be too long. I'm not against long movies if their stories warrant it, but this doesn't. After watching it I left thinking, okay, just how much did I learn about these characters? Not a lot, really. Do I care if Frodo succeeds in his quest? Am I interested in the relationship between Aragorn and Arwen? And what about the other two hobbits that were captured? And Gandalf? I'd have to say that my answer would be no. This film didn't keep me interested in the characters (except for Gandalf, maybe) enough for me to wonder what's going to happen to them. What keeps this movie moving are the characters running from one menace to another. And after what seems to be the twentieth fight scene, you almost wish they'd get killed and be over with it. I've read other reviews that mention this is the first of three books so you have to forgo any character development and get the story moving. This is completely wrong. If you don't care about the characters in the first movie, why bother to see what happens to them in the next? Are we supposed to resign ourselves to the fact that this is a trilogy and we have to see all three to fully appreciate them? No. This is a movie, and it should be judged the same as any other. There are trilogies that the first installment stands on it's own, with or without the others. Ever hear of The Godfather?. And if the answer is, well, it's true to the book and that's the way the book is, I would answer then that's the fault of the book. I know this not to be true. The book is full of character development that Peter Jackson forgo for action. And as for the special effects, I didn't think they were that great. In today's age where you can film a shot in your basement and make it look like you're on top of Mount Everest, spectacular effects are too much common-place. And honestly, some of the scenes had the obvious look of computer-generation to them. No matter how good the special effects are, your eye can still detect something's wrong. No I didn't hate the film as you might think. It was entertaining in some areas. I think the look of some of the different lands in Middle Earth had a nice feel to them.

However when his car breaks down he has to wait in a small town until it is fixed.  Unwittingly he is meets a beautiful woman and her husband, who offers him money to kill her.  With the odds stacking up against Bobby he finds himself drawn deeper into greed, theft and murder.This was a step away from political dramas and conspiracy thrillers for Oliver Stone, here he takes a standard film-noir plot and gives it his own touch.  The plot is pure noir - full of shady characters, femme fatales, double crosses and murder, but it is compelling right till the end.  It's thrilling to see Bobby become trapped in the town of Superior by a series of events (some coincidental, some deliberate) and unable to get away from the inevitable.But what Stone does makes it even better.  He films the whole thing in a style similar to that of Natural Born Killers, except not as graphic.  He uses different film stocks, he cuts in different shots of characters while they voice over - the overall effect adds to the tension and the feeling of excitement.  However he also makes good use of the wide landscape and uses long panoramic shots - this isn't a pop video director!  Another great touch is the music - it's not moody like most noirs but instead mirrors the bright desert by being upbeat and unusual, the overall effect being a very quirky feeling.The cast are roundly excellent and a great list of names.  Sean Penn is totally believable as someone who tries to avoid the unavoidable and you do feel like he's trapped.  Lopez has not been better - she is every inch the sultry femme fatale.
