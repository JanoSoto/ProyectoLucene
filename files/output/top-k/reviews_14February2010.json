And I didn't find it at any video store either. So I waited to watch it through TV and it finally happened.I got to watch the masterpiece that I read about.

I wouldn't say it's my favourite &#x96; that title goes to Roman Polanski's Chinatown &#x96; but objectively I cannot conceive any movie superior, either on technical or acting matters. It's one of the few perfect movies I know. It's also one of the movies I'd gladly pay money to see on a big screen.Using the life story of T.E. Lawrence, Lean, and his masterful screenwriter, Robert Bolt, create an epic movie about a British officer fighting in Arabia during World War I, who becomes a legend in his own time, the man known as Lawrence of Arabia.The movie shows Lawrence befriending the Arabs, organising them in an army, leading a successful terror campaign against the Turks, becoming intoxicated with his own power and attempting to create an Arab state that would be free of any British influence.Unlike the mediocre biopics that today merely illustrate a life, without any artistic flair, Lean and Bolt's masterwork celebrates the enigma that was Lawrence they show him as an apparently mediocre officer who surprised everyone by becoming a master strategist; an officer loathed by his superiors and admired by the Arabs; a man very close to treason in his ambition to create an Arab State, going against all the political aspirations foreign interests had for that area; a poet who hid a sadistic streak. Nothing is simple in this many-faced man's life. Just compare the complexity of this figure with the treatment Nelson Mandela gets in Invictus, for instance, to use one modern biopic. In less than 10 minutes Mandela is explained, he holds no mysteries, all the complexity of his existence was reworked for mass consumption. At the end of 200 minutes, people will continue to scratch their heads trying to make sense of Lawrence of Arabia's personality.As Lean develops the enigma that is Lawrence, he simultaneously rewards the viewer with some of the film-making ever. Ever shot is delicately composed, his camera captures the majesty and dread of the still desert, his characters are but ants in the wide canvases that he paints. One aspect of Lawrence personality that is much explored is his sense of superiority, and I can't think of a better way of ridiculing this than showing Lawrence as an insect on screen.Lawrence of Arabia gathers an envious cast of actors a young Peter O'Toole, who dazzled the world with his performance; Omar Sharif, who plays a friend, or the closest thing Lawrence can have to a friend; Anthony Quinn as an Arab tribe leader; Alec Guiness as Prince Feisal; Claude Rains playing a man who represents British interests in Arabia; and Jack Hawkins as the manipulative General Allenby. There are other great roles for Jose Ferrer, Anthony Quayle and Arthur Kennedy too. I may as well name every actor since I can't think of anyone who was bad in this movie.The relationships between all these characters have provided some of the finest meditations on human nature and its complexity. There's nothing simple about these men they're experienced citizens of the world, each one with his private interests that go from nationalism to political power to delusions of grandeur. Nobility, heroism, treason, ruthlessness, friendship are so pure, so serious in this movie that I have to go back to Homer to find an equal treatment of these topics in art. There's none of the self-consciousness that poisons so much modern art in this movie. The characters represent these ideas entirely without hesitation.Completing the perfection of this movie is Maurice Jarre's unforgettable score, a score so unique when one hears it one immediately knows its source. Jarre composed some of the bests scores for cinema working with David Lean, and Lawrence of Arabia is perhaps his greatest achievement. Like all else in the movie, it's perfection.

I've seen it several times and when I start thinking about it, dismantling the several aspects that constitute it, I don't find anything wrong about it. Perhaps only Lawrence of Arabia has such an equal perfect synthesis of acting, writing, cinematography, editing, story, pacing, music and atmosphere.The movie starts with private investigator J. J. Gittes following a man named Mulwray, whose wife thinks is cheating on her. Gittes takes photos and they make their way into a newspaper. Gittes unknowingly became a pawn in a smear campaign. Furthermore, he discovers that Mulwray's real wife, Evelyn, wasn't the person that hired him. And then Mulwray shows up dead.Chinatown is a movie that simultaneously draws inspiration from the source of film noir and changes this genre. It is not a coincidence that John Huston, the director considered the father of film noir (The Maltese Falcon), plays a supporting role here. Roman Polanski knows his film history and knows how to give credit where credit is due. But Huston was also a good actor so his role here is more than deserved, indeed I could not conceive this movie without his performance he plays an odious, disgusting, unrepentant bastard with such conviction it's difficult to see where the performance ends and the person begins.And then we have Faye Dunaway, playing one of the greatest femme fatales in history. She's a mix of untouchable angel and demonic temptress; she displays a cold reservation about the people around her, a misleading fragility that hides a dangerous mind. Although I've never liked Dunaway much, I think no one has come close to portraying hopeless despair and dread as she does in this movie.But Chinatown also modernises the genre. Not that film noir was ever bad, but the conception of realism is something that changes with time, and what was realistic in Out of the Past or The Maltese Falcon seems unconvincing nowadays. The tough Sam Spade gives way to J.J. Gittes, a down-to-earth private eye who worries if his involvement with murder suspects and his tinkering with evidence won't make him lose his license; and who wears a bandage in his face almost the entire movie after a knife cut. This frailty, this concern with mundane details was unthinkable in noir before Jack Nicholson. The '70s have my favourite performances by Nicholson &#x96; One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest; the movie he made with Antonionni, Professione Reporter; The Last Detail &#x96; and my absolutely favourite is his role as Gittes, an otherwise good-intentioned detective who gets involved in something that's too much for someone as insignificant as him to handle. For although he's the hero of the movie, he's that modern type of hero that achieves nothing.Chinatown is a movie where nobility and heroism meet a dead end. Fatalism, that other gift from classic noir, is much present here. Gittes is a man trying to do good in a world that has no conception of goodness anymore, and he only makes things worse, little by little, until the unforgettable (foretold) ending where everything is tied up. Few movie endings carry such a punch as Chinatown, but it's the only ending suitable.Roman Polanski and Robert Towne, the original screenwriter, deserve all the praise in the world for having created this masterpiece. So do the three main actors. And on a final note, Jerry Goldsmith also deserves recognition for his beautiful score, so beautiful and delicate in its melancholy, that it feels like the movie translated into musical notes.

It has a lot of action and a lot of blood, granted there is some story to it that makes it a step above mindless summer popcorn film. The movie was also a hit with an R rating which is why I will never understand why they weaken so many films these days, bringing them down to PG-13 thinking this is going to bring them more money. This one proves that you can make a ton of cash with an R rating. This along with other R films like 300, the entire Matrix trilogy, Hannibal (hell this one wasn't even a good movie, and a host of others yet they still insist on making most movies PG-13. Well enough of that rant, on to this film. Its story is fairly good involving the leader of an army who is basically retiring after the death of the emperor. Well his son for some reason tries to have him killed and does succeed in killing the soldier's family. Well the soldier ends up being sold and becomes a gladiator who amazes the crowd with his awesome brutality. Well he ends up competing in the coliseum where the man who had his family murder watches. So in the end a nice bloody film and one of the few best picture winners I have ever seen at the theater. I think the only other Oscar winners I have seen at the theater are Titanic and Lord of the Rings Return of the King. This one is good, I do not know if it really merited an Oscar, but I am not going to say something else deserved it that year either as I remember it being a rather weak year for movies.

Schrader wanted to turn Spielberg's alien movie into a flick about Catholicism, the film's hero on a deeply religious quest. Schrader's aim was to tell the tale of an ordinary man who is driven crazy by his obsession with communicating with God. Eventually this man, because he is a steadfast believer, gets chosen and receives a calling from what he initially thinks are UFO hallucinations. Eventually he realises that his encounters with aliens and UFOs are really visions of angels and messages from God. At one point Schrader even talked about the film ending with, not UFO as metaphor for Christ, but an actual image of Jesus lifting our hero up into the heavens.Though mostly wiped away by Spielberg, these themes of communication are still present in the final film. Scientists struggle to communicate with Mexicans, air traffic controllers spew gibberish over one another, our hero is a telecommunications repair man who has problems talking to his noisy family, whilst academics communicate with sign language and machines which look like a kid's giant xylophone.With the absence of religious metaphors, though (Spielberg is Jewish and had hated Schrader's serious religious approach), the arc of the film's hero and constant communication metaphors now becomes strangely meaningless. In the final film, our hero receives messages from aliens, leaves his annoying family, climbs a mountain, meets a UFO and blasts off into space for personal reasons. Other than a vague, very human desire to communicate with the unknown, there's very little logic in the final picture. Why is our hero obsessed with the aliens? Why does he leave his wife and kids and have an odd romantic relationship with a stranger? Why do the aliens want humans? What are the scientists doing? But such questions don't concern Spielberg. To Spielberg, Close Encounters is about far simpler things. It's about toys. It's about playing. It's about a child's wonder in the face of a vast cosmos. Spielberg has a kid's toys come to life, has scientists rolling giant globes like gleeful kids, has professors playfully making hand gestures, casts Francis Traufaunt &#x96; renowned for his films about childhood &#x96; and ends his film with scientists and aliens literally playing a series of musical notes. This is a film in which every character is a child and every special effect, every bit of machinery, a toy. One character even looks up at a UFO (all the film's UFO's look like a kid's spinning top) and yells Toys! And how did Spielberg famously get a child's face to light up during one scene? He dangled a bag of toys off screen until the kid grinned.We've seen Signs and Knowing and know that Schrader's film would have likewise been a heavy-handed slice of evangelism. What Spielberg give us, despite also being what Jonathan Rosenbaum calls dopey Hollywood mysticism, is far more powerful. This is a celebration of man's naivety, his unbridled, gleful exuberance. I've seen some serious sci-fi novelists condemn the film for being anti-science - and it is resolutely anti-science - but it also celebrates the child's view of science. The child's view that machines are like toys and that scientists and dinosaurs and aliens are the coolest things in the world and gee whiz woop-dee-doo, when I grow up I want to be just like them! So perhaps it's better to say the film isn't anti-science, rather, like Jurassic Park, it portrays a kid's enthusiasm for science.Whilst the film's plot is muddled, it also works well as a kind of UFO anthology, Spielberg regurgitating every Twilight Zone episode, sci-fi B movie and pulpy alien story he digested as a kid. And so we have the myth of the country homestead being invaded by aliens (the scariest thing he's ever directed?), of the town losing electricity, of the pilots returning with their memories wiped and of the lost ships and planes mysteriously popping up in the desert. In UFO and paranormal lore, these are all famous myths (or incidents, if you believe them to be factual). The film itself looks like it belongs to that 1950's golden era of UFOs, Roswell, Greys and the Bermuda triangle. It's a lost world of arid landscapes, farms, barns, tractors, pickup trucks, country folk and faceless military men. In a sense, Close Encounters, like the Indiana Jones Movies, is 50s trash made classy by money, simultaneously retro\/nostalgic and cutting edge.The film ends with a jaw-dropping light show, perhaps the most dazzling thing Spielberg has ever shot. But this sequence also epitomizes Spielberg at his worst. Rosenbaum calls it the fascism of spectacle; here is a director who literally uses flashing lights, dancing gizmos, loud noises and giant special effects as a substitute for content. The distractions look great, of course, but when the pyrotechnics are over, you can't help but wonder what the spectacle is actually in the service of. No surprise, then, than both Spielberg and Lucas' early careers were influenced by Lenni Reifenstall; pomp and pageantry as the ultimate form of misdirection.Incidentally, Encounters is, at its core, also about a man who escapes the annoying communication breakdown of Earth by wishing upon a star and hopping aboard a giant toy. With several references to Pinocchio, the film is thus helpful in reading Kubrick's AI, which is a kind of meta-scifi deconstruction of Spielberg, and by extension, modern cinema. It's yet another example of Spielberg's trauma avoidance, of childish characters &#x96; like David the robot &#x96; deluding and placating themselves with fantasy. These foibles suit fantasy movies fine. It's when Spielberg ventures into the real world (Amistad, Schindler etc) that schizophrenia develops, the little machine boy becoming stuck in a programming loop, perpetually whispering to the alien God's, whisk me away and make me a real director.8.5\/10 - Worth multiple viewings.

The animation varies from using pure animation to real live actors being animated over. This unfortunately leads to many scenes suddenly looking obscure and extremely dirty, but quite fascinating. The actual artwork on some of the characters is not as creative as you would expect from a fantasy film. Legolas and Boromir look very good, and so do all of the Hobbits, but Gimli doesn't look like the stereotypical fantasy dwarf you would expect to see. One other problem the film suffers from is the lack of artwork on the Orcs, you only ever see a few models, they all look generic, dirty with very little colour, and lack detail to them. Notice there is no mention of Uruk Hai.... Now that is out of the way lets move onto something that the film is strong on; audio. The voice acting throughout the film is of a really high quality, the voices are extremely clear despite the film being over 30 years old. The script is well constructed and thought through, with competent actors delivering their individual characters well. Even the Orcs, despite their appearance, behave and sound the part; sadistic, manic and unintelligent, sorta how you'd expect a disgruntled and mouldy man in a potato sack to behave. The soundtrack, is much like the voice acting, very good. It just sounds like it belongs in the film. Its hard to describe but sit back in your chair listening to it with your eyes closed, and you could probably imagine what scenes they went with.Moving on to the actual story. Unfortunately I have never read the books so I can't criticise without comparing it to Jackson' films. However on comparing the two films, both hit very similar key scenes. Jackson's films cover more scenes over two films, but Bakshi fits the first two books into two hours. That is not a problem as films never best the written versions, even Jackson omitted some scenes. But it did mean that in Bakshi's version, some characters were only mentioned in passing and not properly introduced, Eowyn and Eomer are two characters who were unfortunately overlooked. In conclusion the film has nothing on the Jackson versions, but as I said pretend Peter Jackson never existed. If you do that you can see how this film, despite being flawed in places, is a very impressive film. Not quite a masterpiece, but definitely a classic worth respect and recognition, especially as Bakshi ran out of money half way through the film.

In the horror genre, one needs to watch The Exorcist to come across a movie that matches the quality of Polanski's masterwork. The more one peers into the past, the more one comes across good horror movies. For all their tameness by modern standards, the truth is these classics are better written, plotted, acted, paced and scored.The story is by now universally known, having seeped into popular consciousness in all sorts of parodies, homages, spoofs and imitations. Let it just be said that the use of demons and the Devil has seldom been so well used in cinema. Again, one must watch The Exorcist, or perhaps its knock-off The Omen, to see it so it used with novelty and artistic quality.Mia Farrow plays Rosemary in a very seductive way, that makes it impossible for the viewer not to sympathise with her from the start. She's such a good-natured, happy woman that it's more tragic when she becomes the target of evil forces trying to control her and her pregnancy. John Cassavetes plays her husband, Guy, an apparently average joe, who's darker than she ever imagined. Ruth Gordon plays a chattering, busybody neighbor, a seemingly harmless old lady, secretly scheming against the innocent Rosemary.Polanski was at the top of his game in 1968 and directed this movie in a very elegant and innovative way. For instance, the movie is bright and colorful. When Rosemary and Guy arrive at their new apartment in the Bramford building, it's a desolate, sinister place, evocative of countless haunted houses of the past. But then they remodel it and it becomes a light, pleasant place to live in. This is one of the many departures from old movies, the idea that horror can happen in the most mundane places, by the most vulgar people.The score is harmonious and peaceful, with a lullaby as the main theme; it's a far cry from the distorted garbage that poisons so many horror movies today. Rather than highlighting the tension, it lulls the viewer into a sense of peace and safety. It's wonderfully manipulative, as horror should be.The story develops at a rational place, slowly building on the strangeness around Rosemary, introducing her to a secret world that isolates her from any help. Rosemary grows more helpless as the movie goes on, and it's a joy to watch Farrow descend into terror and despair little by little. I think this was a major improvement on his previous movie, Repulsion, in which Catherine Deneuve's character always seemed a bit crazy from the start.Although Polanski reached the zenith of film-making with Chinatown, that perfect gem of cinema, Rosemary's Baby stands as one of his best efforts and remains enjoyable and innovative after several decades.

The more one peers into the past, the more one comes across good horror movies. For all their tameness by modern standards, the truth is these classics are better written, plotted, acted, paced and scored.The story is by now universally known, having seeped into popular consciousness in all sorts of parodies, homages, spoofs and imitations. Let it just be said that the use of demons and the Devil has seldom been so well used in cinema. Again, one must watch The Exorcist, or perhaps its knock-off The Omen, to see it so it used with novelty and artistic quality.Mia Farrow plays Rosemary in a very seductive way, that makes it impossible for the viewer not to sympathise with her from the start. She's such a good-natured, happy woman that it's more tragic when she becomes the target of evil forces trying to control her and her pregnancy. John Cassavetes plays her husband, Guy, an apparently average joe, who's darker than she ever imagined. Ruth Gordon plays a chattering, busybody neighbor, a seemingly harmless old lady, secretly scheming against the innocent Rosemary.Polanski was at the top of his game in 1968 and directed this movie in a very elegant and innovative way. For instance, the movie is bright and colorful. When Rosemary and Guy arrive at their new apartment in the Bramford building, it's a desolate, sinister place, evocative of countless haunted houses of the past. But then they remodel it and it becomes a light, pleasant place to live in. This is one of the many departures from old movies, the idea that horror can happen in the most mundane places, by the most vulgar people.The score is harmonious and peaceful, with a lullaby as the main theme; it's a far cry from the distorted garbage that poisons so many horror movies today. Rather than highlighting the tension, it lulls the viewer into a sense of peace and safety. It's wonderfully manipulative, as horror should be.The story develops at a rational place, slowly building on the strangeness around Rosemary, introducing her to a secret world that isolates her from any help. Rosemary grows more helpless as the movie goes on, and it's a joy to watch Farrow descend into terror and despair little by little. I think this was a major improvement on his previous movie, Repulsion, in which Catherine Deneuve's character always seemed a bit crazy from the start.Although Polanski reached the zenith of film-making with Chinatown, that perfect gem of cinema, Rosemary's Baby stands as one of his best efforts and remains enjoyable and innovative after several decades.

According to the tale, Apaches claimed the gold as their property and kept the canyon a secret, killing any prospectors who might enter. Based on books by Texas historian J. Frank Dobbs and Will Henry that recount the legend of the Lost Adams gold mine, Mackenna's Gold tells the story of Ed Adams, an adventurer who claims that he found gold in 1864 but whose camp was attacked by the Apaches and was blinded for life. It is an exciting and imaginative film made at the end of the Western era with its elements of lost treasure lore, secret canyons, and a lost gold mine, although its special effects are severely dated.Shot around the Grand Canyon and the area north of Flagstaff and west of the Hopi Mesas in Northern Arizona, the film reunites actor Gregory Peck, producer and screenwriter Carl Foreman, and director J. Lee Thompson, the same group that had made The Guns of Navarone in 1961. Narrated by Victor Jory, Mackenna's Gold has a stellar cast that includes Peck, Omar Sharif, Telly Savalas and such prominent names as Keenan Wynn, Burgess Meredith, Eli Wallach, Edward G. Robinson, and Raymond Massey. Omar Sharif, an unlikely looking outlaw, plays the villain, a bandit named Colorado who captures Mackenna (Peck), a local marshal who saw a map to the secret canyon given to him by an old Apache warrior.Though Mackenna burned the map, the fact that he has committed it to memory is enough to prevent him from being killed by the ruthless Colorado who makes a deal with Mackenna. In exchange for leading Colorado to the gold, Mackenna will get back his guns and his freedom &#x96; as well as lovely co-hostage (Camilla Sparv). Along the way, the group is pursued by both the Cavalry and Apache warriors and are joined &#x96; or attacked &#x96; by a variety of thieves and desperados, each interested in a share of the gold. With his hands tied, Marshal Mackenna crosses a precarious rope bridge across a narrow, but very deep canyon with Colorado and his gang which includes Hesh-Ke (Julie Newmar), a jealous Apache squaw who was once involved with Mackenna, and Hachita (Ted Cassidy), an Apache warrior.When they emerge, they are on the north side of what is most likely the Little Colorado River Gorge, an area that today is off-limits and roadless with much of it lying in the Navajo Reservation. Somewhere beyond this crossing, Mackenna and Colorado look for the secret canyon with its rich vein of gold, spotting ruins high on a cliff which might have been part of an ancient mining operation. Though the film has first-rate acting, a compelling story, and gorgeous photography, it recycles most of the clichés of the genre shrieking semi-human Apaches bent on wanton killing and macho men either protecting weak women or fighting off aggressive ones and is marred by a dreadful decision to dynamite some of the most beautiful rock formations in the West as an example of retribution by the Apache gods.

'Independence Day (1996)' was a bombastic throwback to popcorn disaster movies, in which an alien civilisation attempts to annihilate the human race in a puff of fiery explosions. 'Deep Impact (1998)' and 'Armageddon (1998)' both entailed meteors on a collision-course with Earth. What was it that made us look up again? It certainly wasn't the threat of nuclear war, or the Space Race, both of which had fuelled the 1950s boom in science-fiction. Perhaps the approaching dawn of a new millennium had evoked in us the sheer insignificance of our own daily situations, casting our minds to previous generations, to an entire race&#x85; and to other races beyond our terrestrial cradle. It was inevitable that filmmakers would return to Stanley Kubrick's science-fiction masterpiece, '2001 A Space Odyssey (1968),' its titular year &#x96; then on the cusp of fruition &#x96; signaling a new age for Mankind. You'll forgive me if my review makes frequent allusions to '2001,' for Robert Zemeckis' Contact (1997)' feels, in many ways, like a feeble imitation of Kubrick's film. In both stories, the human race discovers evidence of a distant extraterrestrial civilisation, and attempts to make contact. Each film creates a sense of awe at the incalculable immensity of the Universe, and Man's own infinitesimal place within it 'Contact' does this via a wonderful computer-generated zoom-out through the solar system and the Milky Way. However, though I admire Zemeckis and Carl Sagan for taking their ideas further than most science-fiction films, I often found the film's approach clumsy and unconvincing. 'Contact' is strongest in its opening half, when SETI astronomer Dr. Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster) discovers what is believed to be radio communication from an interstellar race. The moment of first radio contact is invigoratingly suspenseful, offering some small sense of the excitement that Jerry Ehman must have felt when the Wow! signal came through in 1977. Zemeckis, ever the technical wizard, orchestrates a marvellous long-take that follows Foster from her car, through the observatory entrance, and into the laboratory.As 'Contact' strays farther from contemporary reality, it begins to get bogged-down by tiresome theistic philosophy. '2001' addressed the topic of religion only peripherally, almost dismissively; it was Arthur C. Clarke's stance that any sufficiently-advanced civilisation would be indistinguishable from God (making the notion of God almost redundant). 'Contact' tries to pander to two camps, carefully engineering a scenario by which there is no empirical evidence for Jodie Foster's experience, and then introducing empirical evidence, anyway. The climax, which unfolds following a Douglas Trumbull-inspired wormhole, is interesting, but far too safe using a human avatar to represent the extraterrestrial race is a clumsy way of avoiding having to show them, and simply reminds the viewer that they're watching a movie. Kubrick did it better thirty years earlier, housing Dave Bowman in a Louis XVI-style enclosure that is familiar yet eerily sterile. In fact, watching 'Contact' has, if nothing else, made me appreciate just how much I love '2001,' forever the pinnacle of science-fiction achievement.

If you walk alone, you're likely to end up in places no one has ever been before. This is not without its difficulties, for peculiarity breeds contempt. &#x96; Oscar Wilde Sidney Lumet's 12 Angry Men opens with a teenage boy sitting before a judge. He's been accused of murdering his father. All evidence points to him having committed the crime and even the kid's lawyer believes him to be guilty. Enter the jury 12 men tasked with settling upon a verdict. It seems certain that they will all find the kid accountable. After all, the facts prove that this kid killed his father. Don't they?The jury seclude themselves in a tiny room and take votes. 11 men find the kid guilty. One doesn't. The majority look at the 12th with bemusement. He's Henry Fonda, a mild mannered architect with a temperament of quiet confidence. How dare this guy disagree with them? How dare he stand alone? Tensions develop and the men begin to argue. Fonda plays it cool, stating that he doesn't necessarily believe the kid to be innocent, he simply wants to discuss the matter. After all, a kid's life is on the line. Why make hasty judgements? Why not talk things out, investigate the issue and dig a little deeper? Reluctantly, the others agree to talk. The kid's guilty, no doubt about it, so why not grant this wacky guy a couple hours of discussion? They're getting the day off work anyway. Humour the guy. And of course as the 12 men investigate the case, they begin to grow doubtful. Previously agreed upon truth comes crumbling down, ambiguities arise, new facts come to light, testimonies are cast in a new shade and the motives of witnesses and jurors are shown to be skewed by personal vendettas and a range of social\/racial\/personal biases.The film eventually ends with Henry Fonda, an iconic actor in one of his finest (if far too angelic) roles, having convinced the entire jury that the kid is innocent. With his quiet probing, his appeals to curiosity, truth and intellect over emotional hysteria, popular opinion and snap judgements, Fonda successfully opposes the other jurors. The film's message question the majority, test the Gods with a hammer and be suspicious of commonly held truths. And most importantly, be tactful when contesting the majority, least they threaten you with a switchblade. But who cares? Normal is only a statistical distribution anyway.Upon release, Angry was read as a cautionary tale about McCarthyism, then a hot topic. Later its message became more broad about a callous society's indifference to the less fortunate and willingness to unjustly sustain false accusations. Today, the film's almost a parody of bleeding heart liberals, many siding with the film's courtroom conservatives as a result. What is this? actor Lee J Cobb fumes in the film, Love Your Underprivileged Brother Week or something? His stance is typical today. The notion that offenders are too heavily viewed as victims of oppression, deprivation, racism, mental disorder, systemic problems etc, and so deserving of support rather than punishment.Aesthetically, 12 Angry Men is remarkable; Lumet's camera work is superb and the film drips with both atmosphere and tension. The film also differs hugely from other legal dramas, taking place almost entirely within a jury's room and so sidestepping most of the the usual genre clichés (courtroom antics, last minute testimonials, witnesses, cathartic group-hugs etc).12 Angry Men may also be the finest film shot around a table. Indeed, any director will tell you that filming large groups of people conversing over a table is one of the most taxing things to do. Keeping track of eye-lines, coverage, body positions, shooting each individual from multiple angles over and over again...it's a mighty chore just to get things down on the most basic level, let alone keep the thing feeling kinetic and fresh.So what's remarkable about 12 Angry Men is how much of a spatial movie it is. Director Sidney Lumet, who has a background in theatre (a very static medium, hence, perhaps, the initial appeal of such a claustrophobic script), charts his jury's room with a fluid camera. Watch how gorgeous his mise-en-scene is, how choreographed each character's body movements are, how Lumet's camera traces each character, assigning them spaces within the room. It's an incredibly organised little movie, Lumet dancing us deftly throughout this tiny arena, only to then spew his victors back out into the real world with a series of magnificently expansive shots.Then there's the acting. Lumet has always been an actor's director, and here he populates his film with a wealth of wonderful character actors. But Fonda's the star of course. Dressed in an angelic white suit, he's exactly the kind of morally righteous everyman hero which made many of Jimmy Stewart's early roles so popular. With a mixture of aww shucks, suave sexiness and quiet intelligence, Fonda's immediately endearing. Unfortunately, the motivations of those who oppose Fonda are at times very heavy handed (everyone but Fonda is a raging buffoon, a sneaky attempt to elevate him), each one deliberately positioned to be shot down. End result a heroic tale of progressive compassion defeating reactionary prejudice, in which the saintly conqueror of bigotry is himself bullying, has a firm agenda and is being buffeted by emotionalism.10\/10 &#x96; More great courtroom movies The Verdict, Paths of Glory, Compulsion, Death on the Staircase, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Capturing The Friedmans, The Paper Chase and Murder on a Sunday Morning. Lesser legal flicks Inherit the Wind, JFK, Adam's Rib, Anatomy of A Murder, The Caine Mutiny, Witness for the Prosecution, Miracle on 34th Street, My Cousin Vinny, Anatomy of a Murder.

He's Henry Fonda, a mild mannered architect with a temperament of quiet confidence. How dare this guy disagree with them? How dare he stand alone? Tensions develop and the men begin to argue. Fonda plays it cool, stating that he doesn't necessarily believe the kid to be innocent, he simply wants to discuss the matter. After all, a kid's life is on the line. Why make hasty judgements? Why not talk things out, investigate the issue and dig a little deeper? Reluctantly, the others agree to talk. The kid's guilty, no doubt about it, so why not grant this wacky guy a couple hours of discussion? They're getting the day off work anyway. Humour the guy. And of course as the 12 men investigate the case, they begin to grow doubtful. Previously agreed upon truth comes crumbling down, ambiguities arise, new facts come to light, testimonies are cast in a new shade and the motives of witnesses and jurors are shown to be skewed by personal vendettas and a range of social\/racial\/personal biases.The film eventually ends with Henry Fonda, an iconic actor in one of his finest (if far too angelic) roles, having convinced the entire jury that the kid is innocent. With his quiet probing, his appeals to curiosity, truth and intellect over emotional hysteria, popular opinion and snap judgements, Fonda successfully opposes the other jurors. The film's message question the majority, test the Gods with a hammer and be suspicious of commonly held truths. And most importantly, be tactful when contesting the majority, least they threaten you with a switchblade. But who cares? Normal is only a statistical distribution anyway.Upon release, Angry was read as a cautionary tale about McCarthyism, then a hot topic. Later its message became more broad about a callous society's indifference to the less fortunate and willingness to unjustly sustain false accusations. Today, the film's almost a parody of bleeding heart liberals, many siding with the film's courtroom conservatives as a result. What is this? actor Lee J Cobb fumes in the film, Love Your Underprivileged Brother Week or something? His stance is typical today. The notion that offenders are too heavily viewed as victims of oppression, deprivation, racism, mental disorder, systemic problems etc, and so deserving of support rather than punishment.Aesthetically, 12 Angry Men is remarkable; Lumet's camera work is superb and the film drips with both atmosphere and tension. The film also differs hugely from other legal dramas, taking place almost entirely within a jury's room and so sidestepping most of the the usual genre clichés (courtroom antics, last minute testimonials, witnesses, cathartic group-hugs etc).12 Angry Men may also be the finest film shot around a table. Indeed, any director will tell you that filming large groups of people conversing over a table is one of the most taxing things to do. Keeping track of eye-lines, coverage, body positions, shooting each individual from multiple angles over and over again...it's a mighty chore just to get things down on the most basic level, let alone keep the thing feeling kinetic and fresh.So what's remarkable about 12 Angry Men is how much of a spatial movie it is. Director Sidney Lumet, who has a background in theatre (a very static medium, hence, perhaps, the initial appeal of such a claustrophobic script), charts his jury's room with a fluid camera. Watch how gorgeous his mise-en-scene is, how choreographed each character's body movements are, how Lumet's camera traces each character, assigning them spaces within the room. It's an incredibly organised little movie, Lumet dancing us deftly throughout this tiny arena, only to then spew his victors back out into the real world with a series of magnificently expansive shots.Then there's the acting. Lumet has always been an actor's director, and here he populates his film with a wealth of wonderful character actors. But Fonda's the star of course. Dressed in an angelic white suit, he's exactly the kind of morally righteous everyman hero which made many of Jimmy Stewart's early roles so popular. With a mixture of aww shucks, suave sexiness and quiet intelligence, Fonda's immediately endearing. Unfortunately, the motivations of those who oppose Fonda are at times very heavy handed (everyone but Fonda is a raging buffoon, a sneaky attempt to elevate him), each one deliberately positioned to be shot down. End result a heroic tale of progressive compassion defeating reactionary prejudice, in which the saintly conqueror of bigotry is himself bullying, has a firm agenda and is being buffeted by emotionalism.10\/10 &#x96; More great courtroom movies The Verdict, Paths of Glory, Compulsion, Death on the Staircase, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Capturing The Friedmans, The Paper Chase and Murder on a Sunday Morning.

I enjoyed it and it never bored me at any moment.The movie seems to be characterized as a black comedy, but I felt it was more of a satire. I think Novocaine is commenting on the struggle we all quietly face between living a safe, conventional life and pursuing our fantasies. Frank Sangster (Steve Martin) seems to have it all, money and a beautiful fiancé, with the only glimpse of discontent being and old French movie he plays for the patients, but which is probably more for him. When the sultry Susan (Helena Bonham Carter) sits in his dental chair, his fantasies are suddenly triggered. While most men (all?) would sympathize with Frank for his temptation, we are led to believe its cause is more of a gigantic moment of weakness, not because he's unhappy with his fiancé, Jean (Laura Dern). Also, while Frank is certainly a victim, there's nothing particularly noble about his actions during the film and you don't completely sympathize with him. And even when he achieves his fantasy, it is so clichéd and paid for at such a high price, the movie doesn't ennoble Frank's fantasy. On one hand, the movie seems to be about pursuing one's dreams, but it's fairly cynical about it.One of the best aspects of the movie is the effort given to the minor characters. It felt like they tried to give everyone something interesting to do. Even Kevin Bacon shows up for a small, but very funny part. Some of the movie is predictable and implausible, but there were enough surprises to keep it interesting and if I want complete believability I'll watch a documentary.If there was any weakness in the movie, it's that, while we can understand Frank falling for Susan, there's not enough effort given to make it convincing that Susan had really fallen for Frank. This may have been on purpose early in the movie, to keep you guessing about Susan's intentions, but there should have been one scene before the movie is over which tells you why she wants to be with him. And the movie is a bit thin overall on the motivations and personality of Susan. She is apparently a drug addict and having a difficult relationship with her brother, but this is passed over too little.If you want to watch something a bit different, sort of an anti-Roxanne, this might be worth renting.

Yet, what is in between come and go is where nothing becomes everything and always the same turns into diverse and dynamic. That is what happens in GRAND HOTEL, the silver screen classic directed by Edmund Goulding, the very first all cast movie which does not constitute any vehicle reserved only for a certain celebrity. It appears to be a highly entertaining movie for all people about all different people who meet at the luxurious Grand Hotel in Berlin. Soon after you decide to see the film, you realize that it offers a unique insight into different characters, their psyches, their dreams, their intentions. Therefore, the true merit (and a rare merit) of GRAND HOTEL is not its luxury, its effects, but its people, its character development that, almost 80 years later, occurs to be as convincing as it must have been for the early 1930s audience. Indeed, to address the viewers by means of movie characters is a great success of any cinema production.We get to know these people to certain extend, which allows us to understand them and empathize with them. The wide range of personalities vividly come to our view in the opening scene and we get to know them considerably well before they go.We have a bossy General Director Preysing (Wallace Beery) who behaves in a masterful manner and perceives human relations through money and profit. Yet, where does this attitude lead him to? He enters the hotel as the eminent businessman with a thick wallet and leaves it in the most unpredictable way... There is Baron Von Gaigern (John Barrymore) who, perhaps, experiences the best lesson of life within the walls of the hotel. He gets the courage to tell the truth, yet, realizes that dirty tasks do not pay off... We have an attractive, delicious Flaemmchen (Joan Crawford) who appears to be rather a practical typist than a sentimental pianist. She is the person who makes the most genuine choice in the end... There is also a sympathetic Otto Kringelein (Lionel Barrymore) who looks for company with other people and whom the stay at the grand hotel grants the most unexpected gift of wonderful life he drinks a toast to. Cheers, poor Kringelein! As a simple man, he is, perhaps, the character that we are most likely to empathize with due to his authenticity, quest for happiness, openness, appreciation of people's company and search for love (consider the moment he dances with Flaemmchen)... Finally, we have Madame Grusinskaya (Greta Garbo), the over-dramatic ballerina who says her memorable line I want to be alone and truly wants to be alone until...a true love appears at the door of her heart. We get to know her as a true artist and as a melancholic personality whose emotional decisions take over the practical views.The movie, besides the perfect character development, can boast exceptional artistry. That applies to sets, classical music of Johann Strauss so beautifully fitted to certain moments, and performances of the true elite of the 1930s' silver screen.As I have mentioned before, GRAND HOTEL is one of the few films (especially for its day) where we do not focus on a particular celebrity but treat the whole movie as a mutual effort of artists. From sensual Joan Crawford through terrific Lewis Stone, the Barrymore brothers and great Greta Garbo... all do splendid jobs. But here the real phenomenon comes with the Swedish star so independent, so unique in the history of Hollywood. Although Garbo was known to play the leads in the movies (such was the case with most of her silents and talkies) and rather preferred to be left alone after the shooting hours, GRAND HOTEL was a true exception...she was one of many stars, first of all, and...she stayed for long after filming finding the company of those other stars enjoyable. Later, Garbo stated memorably about working with John Barrymore You have no idea what it means to me to play opposite so perfect an artist. That says for itself...GRAND HOTEL is nearly a masterpiece, the movie that you see and never forget. Since I saw it for the first time on one pleasant carnival afternoon, the charming characters have remained deeply in my memory. I have come back to this film with great pleasure several times since then.

Yet, where does this attitude lead him to? He enters the hotel as the eminent businessman with a thick wallet and leaves it in the most unpredictable way... There is Baron Von Gaigern (John Barrymore) who, perhaps, experiences the best lesson of life within the walls of the hotel. He gets the courage to tell the truth, yet, realizes that dirty tasks do not pay off... We have an attractive, delicious Flaemmchen (Joan Crawford) who appears to be rather a practical typist than a sentimental pianist. She is the person who makes the most genuine choice in the end... There is also a sympathetic Otto Kringelein (Lionel Barrymore) who looks for company with other people and whom the stay at the grand hotel grants the most unexpected gift of wonderful life he drinks a toast to. Cheers, poor Kringelein! As a simple man, he is, perhaps, the character that we are most likely to empathize with due to his authenticity, quest for happiness, openness, appreciation of people's company and search for love (consider the moment he dances with Flaemmchen)... Finally, we have Madame Grusinskaya (Greta Garbo), the over-dramatic ballerina who says her memorable line I want to be alone and truly wants to be alone until...a true love appears at the door of her heart. We get to know her as a true artist and as a melancholic personality whose emotional decisions take over the practical views.The movie, besides the perfect character development, can boast exceptional artistry. That applies to sets, classical music of Johann Strauss so beautifully fitted to certain moments, and performances of the true elite of the 1930s' silver screen.As I have mentioned before, GRAND HOTEL is one of the few films (especially for its day) where we do not focus on a particular celebrity but treat the whole movie as a mutual effort of artists. From sensual Joan Crawford through terrific Lewis Stone, the Barrymore brothers and great Greta Garbo... all do splendid jobs. But here the real phenomenon comes with the Swedish star so independent, so unique in the history of Hollywood. Although Garbo was known to play the leads in the movies (such was the case with most of her silents and talkies) and rather preferred to be left alone after the shooting hours, GRAND HOTEL was a true exception...she was one of many stars, first of all, and...she stayed for long after filming finding the company of those other stars enjoyable. Later, Garbo stated memorably about working with John Barrymore You have no idea what it means to me to play opposite so perfect an artist. That says for itself...GRAND HOTEL is nearly a masterpiece, the movie that you see and never forget. Since I saw it for the first time on one pleasant carnival afternoon, the charming characters have remained deeply in my memory. I have come back to this film with great pleasure several times since then. Indeed, it is something that comes but never goes... for who can forget good hearted Kringelein whom life offered a wondrous gift, melancholic Grusinskaya for whom love occurred greater than pearls, attractive Flaemmchen who found something more precious than work, duties, and poor Baron whose burden became too dangerous a trap... Great film with a lesson about people!

One of a lovable outlaw folk hero and small town sheriff and county fairs and bygone car culture and life on the open road. Its a simple story to be sure, but that is the charm.As for the film itself, its of course not going to win any Oscars. The acting isn't exactly fantastic in a lot of the scenes, and nothing really groundbreaking was happening there. But the characters were developed beautifully and you genuinely care about them and their adventure. Its worthwhile viewing for sure.
