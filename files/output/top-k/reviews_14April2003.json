It is excellent and has a lot of good philosophy, but it doesn't really have an ending.  In place of an ending, it has a long violent action sequence and then the fight between Agent Smith and Neo.   They are among the best action sequences and fights ever filmed, but compared to the richness of the story in the beginning, I always felt it could have been more.What I'm trying to say is that I have no doubt that MATRIX RELOADED and MATRIX REVOLUTIONS are for sure going to be at least as good as the ending of THE MATRIX.  I just hope it also has some of the stuff that made the beginning and middle of THE MATRIX great too.

Instead, think of James Bond meets Terminator, and you've probably got the picture.Harry (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a man going through turbulent times in his marriage, though he is not aware of this. He's too busy working with computer conferences. His wife (Jamie Lee Curtis) is bored with her husband, her house, her job, her life. She wants excitement. Danger. Mystery. Intrigue. And Harry's delivering none of this. So she strikes an affair with Bill Paxton, a secret agent for the government. But here's where the irony is Paxton isn't a secret agent. On the other hand, what Jamie Lee Curtis was looking for she had all along her husband, Harry, works for the FBI, CIA, or something in that vicinity. He's a spy, so to speak. His boring, dull, computer-expert persona is all a front for something more important. He and fellow spy Tom Arnold are the best of the best.The beginning of the film opens with Harry cutting through ice, floating to the top, making his way to the shore of a rich manor, shredding off his diving suit (revealing a tux, much like the underwater sequence in Goldfinger where Connery comes out with a tux), and entering the manor, which is host to a party right now. Harry then makes his way to an upstairs bedroom where he uploads info on who's been selling what on the black market.This does, of course, lead to some sort of plot with bad guys and explosions, but I didn't pay attention to that. (Well actually, I did, but to tell you the truth I can't remember a thing about the plot since I last saw the film.) The thing I do remember is that I was a bit disappointed, mainly because I had heard so many good things about this film. I mean, James Cameron, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and James Bond spoofing material...what can go wrong? Well, nothing really went wrong, but the film slows down in too many areas and tries to start a side-plot with Curtis and Schwarzenegger's marriage life, which is fine (because you have to wonder what Bond's life would be like if he was--or had stayed--married), but the film seems to divert courses just to examine this in overly-long sequences. It dabbles a bit too long in the side-plot and doesn't focus enough on what it set out to do, which is half-spoof Bond, half-spoof the Schwarzenegger\/Cameron team.Luckily this is all made up for with a terrific beginning and terrific ending. Schwarzenegger oozes with self-confidence in a not-too-ignorant kind of way, and, guess what, Tom Arnold is actually FUNNY in this movie. Yes, you read that right. Funny. Something he never seems to be, even when given the right material. In fact, Tom Arnold is so funny in this film, I found myself missing his sorry face when he wasn't on screen!Cameron has made better (The Terminator), and so has Schwarzenegger (The Terminator), but what he and Schwarzenegger set out to do comes through pretty good, even if the middle slowed down and diverted courses in the wrong direction a bit.4\/5 stars -John Ulmer ","genre":null},{"date":"14 April 2003","score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":"  True Lies works on two conditions You aren't expecting The Terminator, and you aren't expecting James Bond.

He is subtle, a bit creepy, vulnerable, itchy...and something else...OUCH...really, painfully, oddly sexually attractive. I think I need to buy these two movies to watch in the wee hours.My husband and I have had (SEMI-SPOILER!) long conversations about what we think went on after he turned off the camera with Ann.So many of his other movies don't give Spader this range of opportunities (Secretary does, happily!), except maybe Less Than Zero (with another sexy-creepy favorite, Rob't Downey Jr).It bears repeat watching, just for him.On the DVD, the director's commentary with Soderberg, is insanely annoying and inane.

I can just picture him sitting in his office, trying to come up with the inspiration to write a darker, less happy-meal-friendly Star Wars. Since he didn't do most of the writing on The Empire Strikes Back, this would be a harder task for him than one might believe.So one day, Rick McCallum hands him a copy of Black Sabbath's second album, Paranoid. Through the first three songs, Lucas has no idea what to make of it until song number four starts blaring out of the speakers - a poetic and guitar-riff masterpiece called Iron Man. Obviously, Lucas was so blown away by this song that he copied the concept and story described in the lyrics into his script. There is not a single idea in either prequel so far that hasn't been used as the basis for a song by at least Black Sabbath or half a dozen of the literally thousands of true doom metal bands that follow in their footsteps. No, not the poseurs like Slipknot or the likes of Rob Zombie, I mean the real thing such as Cathedral or Electric Wizard.Of course, Lucas wasn't totally out to lunch when he made The Phantom Menace. There was one sequence in the original story treatment in which young Anakin finds a Tusken Raider who has been wounded in battle or transit, whom he sits with and tries to help until the Tusken's clansmen come back to reclaim him. Including this scene in Episode I would have made the scene in Episode II where Anakin kills an entire colony of Tusken Raiders without pity or judgement all the more ironic (something that the film could have used, in fact), but at the same time, it would have made the idea that Lucas was listening too hard when Ozzy Osbourne sang the words ...kills the people he once saved... a little obvious to those who haven't been totally hypontised by eMpTyV.Another area where Lucas errs is all this crap about a prophecy that Anakin is supposed to fulfil. The Jedi treat Anakin as if he is some kind of commodity, despite the fact that he has lived a large portion of his life as a slave and had none of the emotional comforts that most human beings should be allowed to take for granted. Not only that, but the apparent rules of the Jedi organisation completely and utterly contradict normal, healthy human behaviour. Whereas the Force and its users seemed more like a spiritual connection to the life of the universe and those who were in touch with it during the other three films, the Jedi order has so far been made out to be more like a violent offshoot of the death cult which has begun threatening democracy in America during the prequels. At least they are timely.It is hard, therefore, for the educated, enlightened, thinking audience to give so much as a rat's about the idea that the Jedi will almost all be killed in the forthcoming episode. Just as I wouldn't give a damn if Pat Robertson or Kenneth Copeland were used as target practise by a mob of stormtroopers, I could not give a damn what happens to these high and mighty hypocrites.It's hard to say where I stand on the romance subplot. On the one hand, I can understand why Anakin and Padmé are so awkward with one another. They've already been through so much together that any feeling they have towards each other is going to be to their emotions what a small dose of pure, hospital-grade Morphine is to the average human's sense of pain. On the other hand, making out like they've had no contact with other human beings of the opposite sex beyond what is permissible in a G-rated film (ironically, this is the first of Lucas' Star Wars saga to be rated above a PG in Australia) is a big, big mistake. Any human being above the age of 13 is going to find this just too unbelievable. And then Lucas commits the ultimate blunder - giving us no reason to believe that a strong, powerful woman like Padmé would fall in love with a whiny brat like Anakin. There ARE ways to display extreme negative emotions (which are a natural part of life, contrary to what the saga's mythos will tell you) without whining.Barney, the purple dinosaur, would understand this update of the saga very well. He has said in many an episode that his wards are not good unless they have good feelings - if you substitute that for some of the dialogue in Episodes II, V, and VI, the story would make just as much sense. Lucas also seems to be into showing 19 year olds as having the same emotional and intellectual responses as nine year olds. Another Barney trademark. About the only time the level of this film is raised to something vaguely adult is when Christopher Lee is on the screen. Like Liam Neeson, he always manages to raise the standard of the film he is on a notch or three, and it is during the duel(s) with Obi-Wan and Anakin (plus the battle leading up to them) that this film manages to become at least partly satisfying on an intellectual level. The duel with Yoda spoils it slightly, with the attempt to show that training Jedi for 800+ years does make you a better fencer getting way too cartoonish and clumsy for its own good. However, the closing scenes with the clone army (by the way, why is it so trendy to portray a technology that could rid us of things like cancer for good in such a bad light?) and Anakin's wedding set a tone that should have been kept up during the entire film. It's as if in those closing moments, someone remembered what made Episodes V and VI so damned interesting.To cut a very long story short, this is nowhere near as good as the people who say this is one of the better episodes would like you to believe, but it does constitute a valiant effort to deliver a more adult science fiction story, something that Lucas should know by now that he is incapable of. Overall, this episode gets a 5 out of 10 from me, and three of those points are for Christopher Lee. The climax of the film was great (if a little sloppy at times), it's the rest of it that is the problem.

Just as I wouldn't give a damn if Pat Robertson or Kenneth Copeland were used as target practise by a mob of stormtroopers, I could not give a damn what happens to these high and mighty hypocrites.It's hard to say where I stand on the romance subplot. On the one hand, I can understand why Anakin and Padmé are so awkward with one another. They've already been through so much together that any feeling they have towards each other is going to be to their emotions what a small dose of pure, hospital-grade Morphine is to the average human's sense of pain. On the other hand, making out like they've had no contact with other human beings of the opposite sex beyond what is permissible in a G-rated film (ironically, this is the first of Lucas' Star Wars saga to be rated above a PG in Australia) is a big, big mistake. Any human being above the age of 13 is going to find this just too unbelievable. And then Lucas commits the ultimate blunder - giving us no reason to believe that a strong, powerful woman like Padmé would fall in love with a whiny brat like Anakin. There ARE ways to display extreme negative emotions (which are a natural part of life, contrary to what the saga's mythos will tell you) without whining.Barney, the purple dinosaur, would understand this update of the saga very well. He has said in many an episode that his wards are not good unless they have good feelings - if you substitute that for some of the dialogue in Episodes II, V, and VI, the story would make just as much sense. Lucas also seems to be into showing 19 year olds as having the same emotional and intellectual responses as nine year olds. Another Barney trademark. About the only time the level of this film is raised to something vaguely adult is when Christopher Lee is on the screen. Like Liam Neeson, he always manages to raise the standard of the film he is on a notch or three, and it is during the duel(s) with Obi-Wan and Anakin (plus the battle leading up to them) that this film manages to become at least partly satisfying on an intellectual level. The duel with Yoda spoils it slightly, with the attempt to show that training Jedi for 800+ years does make you a better fencer getting way too cartoonish and clumsy for its own good. However, the closing scenes with the clone army (by the way, why is it so trendy to portray a technology that could rid us of things like cancer for good in such a bad light?) and Anakin's wedding set a tone that should have been kept up during the entire film. It's as if in those closing moments, someone remembered what made Episodes V and VI so damned interesting.To cut a very long story short, this is nowhere near as good as the people who say this is one of the better episodes would like you to believe, but it does constitute a valiant effort to deliver a more adult science fiction story, something that Lucas should know by now that he is incapable of. Overall, this episode gets a 5 out of 10 from me, and three of those points are for Christopher Lee. The climax of the film was great (if a little sloppy at times), it's the rest of it that is the problem.

I remembered siding with Daniel as a youngster, but upon further review I find myself siding with Cobra Kai for the extermination of this little punk who is supposedly from Newark, as if he wouldn't get his ass kicked there too.  That's another thing I didn't get, he moves from Newark, where supposedly he was bad-ass, to a ritzy high school in CA and now he starts getting into fights?  I don't think there is a person on the planet, except for people with down syndrome and Foley, who couldn't beat up LaRusso.  Anyway, here's why I hate Larusso and think he's a punk who deserved to get his ass kicked every second of that movie.1) first time larusso meets Johnny Lawrence, (brilliantly played by Wiliam Zabka), Larusso is hitting on JL's ex, who by the way isn't his type. Larusso needs some trampy jersey girl cause he's too much of a wuss to hook up with anyone else.  Anyway, JL just wants to chat with his old woman and larusso butTs his pathetic ass in and starts looking for trouble, obviously JL beats the crap out of him.2) Larusso is trying out for the soccer team, which in the mold of She's All That is the big sport at the school (note that schools like this are completely queer), anyway Bobby slide tackles Larusso, legally might I add, and Larusso goes crazy tackling Bobby to the ground, he then drills him in the face.  Bobby laughs because getting punched by Larusso would be like getting into a pillow fight with a small Pakistani baby.  Then the coach kicks Larusso out of tryouts, it's usually not a good idea to start a fight during them, especially when you're a wuss.3) Lawrence and the crew are finished with larusso, as far as they're concerned he doesn't exist.  However, Larusso is still looking for trouble. At the halloween party at the school JL is minding his own business smoking a J in one of the stalls and Larusso decides it would be a great idea to douse him with a hose.  Obviously the Cobra Kai crew chase him for a while and beat the crap out of him, which he easily deserved.  JL even had the line you couldn't leave well enough alone could you Larusso..., JL was ready to ignore Larusso but he had to keep pushing them.  Who does that? Who starts fights with 6 guys who could all kick your ass?  That would be like me walking into the NY Giants locker room and kicking Shockey in the balls, just a stupid idea regardless of the security breach.Thus, Larusso is a wuss who deserved everything he had before he started training with Miagi.  Although my ending of this movie would have had the fat guy from Cobra Kai winning the All Valley under 18 tourney, he was a real darkhorse.  Also notice how everyone at Cobra Kai was a black belt except for the fat kid and the black kid (lamar from Nerds), makes you think if Sensai was some sort of Nazi, I posit he was.

He's salvaged by a fishing boat and awakens to discover he has no memory of his previous life.  After he recuperates, he heads to shore to find his true identity.  With the assistance of a pretty German woman (Franka Potente), Bourne goes on the run with covert assassins trying to kill him and top government agents trying to cover their tracks.The Bourne Identity is an interesting summer thriller.  It's certainly not an all-out action blockbuster, as the previews might lead you to believe, but there are some terrific action sequences.  What truly makes the film work is Damon himself, whose first bid as an action star is completely convincing and engaging.  The movie nicely keeps us in the dark about his past, we know just as much as he does and eagerly anticipate every discovery he makes.  From a certain point-of-view, Franka Potente isn't useful except as a love interest, and on that level, her presence works.  Not only is she a fine actress, but she and Damon share a palpable chemistry.  Hopefully, she'll return in the sequel, and this series won't go the Bond\/MI route with a new love interest in every installment.  Take note, Hollywood, steadiness and consistent relationships are always appreciated.The Bourne Identity's premise is similar to The Long Kiss Goodnight's, but unlike that movie, takes its story seriously and aspires to work as both a thriller and a character-oriented drama, which it does.  Once Bourne's past is revealed (not that it isn't that hard to figure out), the film loses a bit of momentum, but does wrap things up believably and in a suprisingly somewhat quiet fashion (compared to say, Bond, Triple X, or MI).For action fans, there's enough here to keep them satisfied, with the standout setpieces being an excellent martial arts fight set in an eerily empty apartment and an exhilarating car chase through the streets of Paris.  I've seen at least two other films with auto chases set in Paris (Ronin, The Transporter) and this one's my favorite, even though it's also the shortest and features the least attractive car (a mini as compared to an Audi in Ronin and a BMW in The Transporter).There are a few disappointments here and there, particularly Bourne's showdown with The Professor (Clive Owen), which concludes rather abruptly considering the huge build-up.  Julia Stiles is also in the film, and her presence is rather distracting (I can't look at her without thinking, Hey, it's Julia Stiles!) in a role that could have been played by just about anyone.  But in the end, The Bourne Identity succeeds because it rarely goes over-the-top (no megalomaniacal billionaires here), maintains an even tone, and establishes likeable characters and good storytelling.

Once Bourne's past is revealed (not that it isn't that hard to figure out), the film loses a bit of momentum, but does wrap things up believably and in a suprisingly somewhat quiet fashion (compared to say, Bond, Triple X, or MI).For action fans, there's enough here to keep them satisfied, with the standout setpieces being an excellent martial arts fight set in an eerily empty apartment and an exhilarating car chase through the streets of Paris.  I've seen at least two other films with auto chases set in Paris (Ronin, The Transporter) and this one's my favorite, even though it's also the shortest and features the least attractive car (a mini as compared to an Audi in Ronin and a BMW in The Transporter).There are a few disappointments here and there, particularly Bourne's showdown with The Professor (Clive Owen), which concludes rather abruptly considering the huge build-up.  Julia Stiles is also in the film, and her presence is rather distracting (I can't look at her without thinking, Hey, it's Julia Stiles!) in a role that could have been played by just about anyone.  But in the end, The Bourne Identity succeeds because it rarely goes over-the-top (no megalomaniacal billionaires here), maintains an even tone, and establishes likeable characters and good storytelling.

He's salvaged by a fishing boat and awakens to discover he has no memory of his previous life.  After he recuperates, he heads to shore to find his true identity.  With the assistance of a pretty German woman (Franka Potente), Bourne goes on the run with covert assassins trying to kill him and top government agents trying to cover their tracks.The Bourne Identity is an interesting summer thriller.  It's certainly not an all-out action blockbuster, as the previews might lead you to believe, but there are some terrific action sequences.  What truly makes the film work is Damon himself, whose first bid as an action star is completely convincing and engaging.  The movie nicely keeps us in the dark about his past, we know just as much as he does and eagerly anticipate every discovery he makes.  From a certain point-of-view, Franka Potente isn't useful except as a love interest, and on that level, her presence works.  Not only is she a fine actress, but she and Damon share a palpable chemistry.  Hopefully, she'll return in the sequel, and this series won't go the Bond\/MI route with a new love interest in every installment.

It is a fine work, with a unique perspective on the Vietnam War.  It was especially poignant, as I was preparing for military service during the Reagan\/Bush years.  This was not a film about the soldiers in the rice paddies; or protesters in Washington.  This is the story of the men who had to bury the dead and honor their memories.  These were soldiers who might be going to Vietnam, and those who had come back from there.  It's about the senseless loss of life that war brings and the hubris of youth.Spoilers-James Caan gives an outstanding performance.  He has seen Vietnam and would rather be over there or in a training position, where he feels he could help bring some of these boys back alive, rather than burying them.  He is torn up by the knowledge that he can't help.  He meets and falls in love with Anjelica Huston, a reporter who opposes the war, but is attracted to Caan.  Caan tries to make her see his point, that he doesn't love the war, but has the knowledge hat could save some of the men who have to fight it.DB Sweeny has some fine moments as the young soldier who is itching to be in the middle of the war.  He is the face of so many who did their duty and paid a horrible price.There are many fine performances in this film, but it doesn't always come together.  Still, it is greater than its faults.I didn't notice this in the goofs; but, in the original video release, you could clearly see the boom mic in frame during the restaurant conversation between Sweeny and his girl.

He is actuall a corrupt, but good cop in what I can say is a contradictory role for Yun-Fat(in a different role from the one in Replacement Killers).  I liked how he went to extreme measures on his cases including one part where there was a rival officer on his case from the FBI.  In this with him is Mark Wahlberg as a rookie cop interested in the well being of the Chinese immigrants but also has a secret of his own.  The buddy role between Chow Yun-Fat and Mark Wahlberg is pretty cool and the action in this film was well-done including one car chase that really stood out like a black sheep in a flock of white.
