Among the good is the developing plot (I know many would disagree, but let me explain), SOME of the actors, and, of course, the special effects.Unfortunately, the things that do not work are extremely important to the film, generally moreso than the ones that do work. It must be agreed that the chemistry between Portman's Amidala and Christensen's Anakin does not convince. Also, Christensen's portrayal is lacking in many other ways. Do not be so quick to condemn him, though, his task was not easy, and even less so with some of the abhorrent dialogue that was handed to him. Ask yourself how many actors would have been able to take that dialogue and use it for a performance worthy of James Earl Jones' ominous and threatening Vader.The other thing that the other reviewers have stated that I agree with is that the interconnectedness of this film and episode I with the originals was a mistake. As tempting as it likely was to work the history of R2-D2 and C-3PO into the plotline, it should have been done in a far, far less obvious way if it was done at all. Anakin BUILT C-3PO??? Come on....I have always liked Ian McDiarmid, Natalie Portman, and Ewan McGregor in this series. McGregor's portrayal was definitely weak in Episode I, and he has improved it much. It will be interesting to see if he becomes even more like Alec Guiness' Obi-Wan in Episode III. I also agree with another reviewer that a fiercely competitive training duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan would have been an excellent addition, serving both to highten uneases about Anakin's future (not that this is needed, mind you), and to foreshadow the duel that I feel is inevitable in Episode III where Anakin is defeated and badly injured by Obi-Wan.Christopher Lee makes a good addition as Count Dooku, but his character does not get enough early screen time and comes off sort of confusing, until the later parts make no ambiguity about his allegiances. The gladiatorial sequence should have been ammended, as the bad guys do the classic sit around and do absolutley nothing while the good guys get away move. Jango Fett makes a good addition to the Star Wars universe, and the battle scene between him and Obi-Wan was good.The political situation that will eventually culminate with the dissolution of the Senate by Palpatine in A New Hope is also interesting, although I find that it has a little more in common with the French Terror before the Republic than it does with the American Revolution. Palpatine has used the Trade Federation and the Republic to increase his own power in the senate in a very tricky way. First promoting the crisis on Naboo and using Amidala in order to pronounce a vote of No Confidence in Chancellor Vallorum and riding on the title of man of action and hero of the day for his role in opposing the Trade Federation (which he secretly controls) in order to take the place of the old Chancellor.All of this, of course, happens in Episode I, and in Episode II you can see him gathering all of the forces of the Trade Federation and its allies in order to create a threat to the Republic. Added to this opposition is, of course, Count Dooku and the separatists, and Palpatine fosters fears of these threats in order to legitimize the Army of the Republic, which he will then use as the military might to back up his eventual move for dominance over galactic government.The series badly needs improved dialogue, however. Although the dialogue in these films was never what you would call great, this series does not have the luxury of a Han Solo to lighten the mood a little and keep things from getting laughable. Some of the dialoge between Amidala and Anakin was good (The I hate sand line was good up until it turned into a cheesy pick-up line), but most of it was not. More good dialogue came in the form of Padme and Anakin discussing how to better the clearly stagnant political system.Many of the points in the film were belabored heavily, and sometimes I found myself thinking alright, already, I get it, something is rotten in the state of Tattooine. The scenes where you could see the negative traits exhibited by Anakin that will eventually transform him into Vader were well done, particularly the scene where he talks about massacring the Tusken Raiders' village.Yoda battling Count Dooku in a lightsaber duel seems ill-advised to me. I have always perceived Yoda as one of those inner strength kind of characters who have little need for physical combat, an almost zen-like character in a manner of speaking. The scene might have been better shot as a force-duel between the two, culminating with Dooku using his last reserves of power to topple something heavy onto Anakin and Obi-Wan, and forcing Yoda to rescue them, giving him a chance to escape.Criticism of a man with as much experience as George Lucas must of course be taken with a grain of salt from someone like me, but I think an important lesson could be learned by this movie and Episode I; It is vital that the movie's time is not cluttered with needless scenes and characters. The focus must be kept on the ones that are truly integral to the story, and it is important to give them good dialogue and encourage delivery of this dialogue in such a way as is both pleasing to the audience and in-line with the character's emotions and motivations.Well, as for the grade that I gave this movie, it's an 8 of 10, because it's Star Wars, and because, as disappointed as I was with much of it, most of that disappointment was a result of the expectations being placed on the film, not the film itself.

Unfortunately because of that attitude I have been exposed to some absolutely horrible movies.  'Save The Last Dance' was horrible, 'What Women Want' was horrible.  This movie as well, though not as much as the other two I mentioned, was horrible.  Its true that it is formulaic.  Its true then that it's predictable.  But thats no excuse for poor direction and laugh out loud dialogue. First of all, I must discuss my disgust with Amanda Peet for being in this movie.  These are the kind of movies (along with 'Whipped') that killed careers.  Whoever her manager is should be fired instantly.  Her character is unimportant in many ways, and every line she utters is like someone sticking a tack in your head and then twisting it for a little while.  Meanwhile, Ashley Judd doesn't fair a whole lot better.  This is a typical Ashley Judd role though.  She gets beaten, then she cries some.  You go girl.  And then I wonder whats up with Morgan Freeman.  How do you go from 'The Shawshank Redemption' to this piece of, well, its a piece of something.  Of course we couldn't get through drivel like this without the usual array of plot twists to keep us on the edge of our seats.  Well, in my case it would be shaking my head in disgust, and my neck hurts after all of the disgust I had to endure during this movie.  Of course some of it was sooooo bad that it did make me laugh.  By that time it was just out of frustration of course.  (***SPOILER LINES***) I must comment on the last plot twist, which I'm sure most of you could guess.  Its not the twist that was the problem, but there is a fight scene in the last moments in the movie, and it was the worst lit fight scene I have ever seen.  It was at night, and the action is so poorly followed and edited that you actually can't tell who is hitting who, and who is getting hit.  Until the closeup of the man on the floor, you're never sure who got beaten up.  That was just absolutely horrible and it disgusts me thinking about it now, thinking that somehow a studio executive said that this movie was suitable for viewing. (***END OF SPOILER***)In conclusion, I am going to say this.  Ashley Judd, if you ever happen to read this, I challenge you to pick one movie, just one, that isn't this insipidly bad.  I challenge you to pick a movie where the story doesn't seem as if it was told by a five year old, and has a constant narrative flow.  Find a director that can pace the action so it is tolerable and who knows how to piece a movie together.  Please, save your career now, while you still have a chance.  Don't make another 'Where The Heart Is', but do something good for a change.  I know that there's talent in your family, and obviously you have to have some.  Find someone that will exploit it properly for once.  I don't want to see you in another 'Double Jeopardy'.  Step up to the big leagues, please.

I thought it was another of those simplistic and popular - love the teacher, fight delinquency - movies. In fact I refused to be taken for granted by clever Hollywood people who, usually, produce very sweet and educative movies. Well, a couple of years later, while I was refurbishing my own movie collection I stumbled on a special LaserDisc sale and bought this one as well (just to see what all the fuzz about it was really about). First of all, I was amazed to know that it is based on a true story, just like Lean on me and what caught my attention was that the teacher in question didn't belong to that profession she was a discharged and unemployed USMC officer. I expected a war between her and the pupils she would drill. What I received in return was an education on how one can be prejudiced, in more than just one way... Having served in the Swiss Army and having been a teacher myself, I could really empathize with the Character played by Michelle Pfeiffer. My first teaching approach, unlike hers, was disastrous to say the least... The entire movie deals with LITTLE, REAL, EVERYDAY problems and not with the big issues of life and this is probably why this movie was summarily discarded as being second rate. But when we consider how children consider and perceive our world nowadays, it's exactly what they expect us, the adults, to do as well. That's to say, take our time to explain to them the everyday happenings in their little worlds. Why mom and dad went their separate ways, why do they have to cope with homework they cannot understand and so on and so forth. This movie is a teaching lesson for teachers, not a moralizing or preachy one. It shows us how it should be done, nothing more. In Drama one says less is more, why shouldn't it apply to life? We always want to set standards and a higher example to the students we are supposed to tutor, but what about our commitment to give them what they really want lend them an ear when they talk, a heart when they feel sorrow, and sometimes, when required, a firm authority to look up to? Many colleagues I have met have forgotten what teaching is all about. It's not a simple profession to earn your life, it's much more than this, it's a mission, a passion, a drive, a call, just like the one an actor or a director have.

Films such as 3000 Miles To Graceland make me question the screenwriters ability to come up with an entertaining script. Two hours of non-stop gratuitous action and four high profile actors cannot make up for the lacking elements of 3000 Miles To Graceland. This film fails to reach the potential it had with the original concept.There is nothing new about 3000 Miles To Graceland because a similar plot was created to entertain audiences a year earlier called Reindeer Games. Since I enjoyed Reindeer Games, I thought I would enjoy this film; however, I was sorely disappointed to learn that this movie was nothing more than four men with a desire to play dress up in Elvis costumes. If I wanted to see Elvis impersonators, I would travel to Memphis and take part in the Elvis convention.The biggest problem I found with 3000 Miles To Graceland was understanding the reason why this film was made. Four men parading around in Elvis costumes is so uninteresting I felt like walking out of the theater and asking for my money back; something I rarely find myself doing. Another problem I had was the lack of focus and commitment showed by the actors. With each passing scene, it became painfully obvious that the actors were more interested in the concept of prancing around in costumes playing cowboys and indians.Though there was a plot somewhere scattered among this mess; however, I failed to see the connection and relevance of most of the scenes. The scenes seemed to be slapped together and forced for the purpose of making another Elvis film. The writers must have had their minds on other topics because their effort certainly showed in the outcome. Zero plot, zero effort and zero character development totals a really bad written film.

Watching Costner perform in 3000 Miles To Graceland was terrible because he put no effort into trying to make his character come alive. I look forward to the next Costner film because it is sure to be a hit.Russell has always been actor one can always count on to deliver powerful and comedic performances; however, he takes a nosedive with his worst film since Soldier. Like Costner, I sat through 3000 Miles To Graceland watching Russell perform in a flat and extremely one-dimensional role. It hurts to see an actor who has had a successful movie career make a huge mistake choosing to make this movie. I could only wish and hope he can rebound from this movie and get on track once again.I would like to talk about the supporting cast; however, there performances were so awful it doesn't deserve any comment.

WOW!Mom always said to watch out for the quiet ones as still waters run deep, and Maquire's performance as dear dark Spidey was no exception. He may appear cherubic, but there's definitely more going on than meets the eye. He was a wonderful surprise, and I live now for the sequel when an older, wiser Maguire takes on more evil in our world. His performance was powerful without being overpowering or over-the-top. He's an actor to be reckoned with.I've loved Kirsten Dunst's performances since I first laid eyes on her in Interview With A Vampire (as Claudia). She magically makes each role her own, and she's shown great range in her brief career. My only complaint with her role as MJ in Spiderman is superficial - she looks nearly asleep in many of her close-ups. (Perhaps pretty boy Maguire has her under his spell?)Willem Defoe let's it all hang out as Gobby (don't you just love Spidey's pet name for the nasty Green Goblin?) and he's a blast. He's completely convincing as the schizophrenic madman who tries to destroy Spidey and everyone he loves. I almost forgot he was the bad man a couple of times and felt sorry for him.This film would never have worked had it not been for the genius of Sam Raimi (another selling point for getting me to the theatre). He's shows more subtlety in Spiderman but his trademark slo-mo's are still there, and he takes what could have been another boring superhero flick and adds his unique brand of excitement (can you imagine The Quick and The Dead without Raimi's influence?)All in all, the film is a great afternoon romp, and I may go see it again (to hold me until the sequel). There are a couple of scenes that will bewilder the very young, though there were some in the audience and they didn't seem to be too disturbed. Still, I wouldn't chance it with anyone under 10.
