In the beginning of the story, in Mexico, the main character named TIta is born. Tita's father dies of heart attack after he discovers that his second child, Gertrudis, is not his own. From the start, Tita spent most of her time in the kitchen with the cook, Nacha. When Tita falls in love with a man named Pedro, her mother forbids her to marry him. According to her family tradition, Tita's mother, Elena, informs Tita that she will never marry. Instead, Tita is told she will be forced to care for her mother until her death. Elena, cruelly offers her other daughter, Rosaura, to Pedro instead of Tita. Pedro agrees to marry Rosaura in order to be closer to Tita.Throughout the movie, Tita and Pedro go through many struggles and obstacles that keep them apart. The emotions and feelings that come along with their conflict are enhanced with the use of food and magical realism. For instance, when Tita is forced to prepare the wedding cake for Pedro and Rosaura's wedding, she is so broken-hearted that she cries into the cake batter. The next day, when the guests eat the dessert, they all begin crying for their lost loves. This results in the entire party getting sick. Probably one of the most intense scenes of the movie happened when Tita cooked a delicious quail dinner that included the roses she had received from Pedro. After her family ate the meal, Gertrudis found herself excited sexually. This was Tita's way of showing Pedro her passion for him.Overall, the movie included elegance, strict\/proper behavior, and beauty. Like Water for Chocolate emphasized high emotions and captures a romantic, considerate audience. Anyone who has struggled with love could surely relate to this film. The magical realism played a large role in the film. Just enough was added to create an interesting story, but it was not too overboard. This film plays with the readers emotions, and allows the audience to develop strong feelings either for or against the characters in the story. Another key element of the film is its dramatic, romantic music. The movie provides all aspects of a romantic, passionate environment. Like Water for Chocolate is an incredible Mexican love story.

But a rather complex one, you need to see it at least three times to start getting into it, even if it gets into you at first sight with its gorgeous cinematography, its straight--from--the--heart poetry, its subjective mood. Al what it needs is a little bit of scissor work here and there and better articulated voice overs.Malick's here is an incredibly subjective camera. So much so, sometimes it doesn't simply show you what a particular character sees, but what he PREFERS to see. The best ex. is the native village, as seen by Witt's eyes. At the beginning it looks as an earthly paradise, because he wants to see it that way. But that's unreal and the best proof of it lies in his dialog with the woman, when she corrects him the children do fight--and the adults, we may add. It is only in this 2nd visit that he sees the real thing. What we see then through his eyes is not dark, only normal (dark, if we compared it to his initial daydreaming.) If you apply this to the whole film you'll understand it better and see how some of its flaws are really strokes of genius. Travolta's character, for ex., which is pivotal in the plot. He's perfect in his role cocky, more of a playboy than a BG, he has no place there, even less wearing that uniform. But that's the point! That's how Tall sees him and that's salt in his wounded pride. And that pushes him to force C Company to launch a suicidal assault on the hill. That scene on the ship deck is crucial to understand what follows, as it gives the needed emotional push for the next hour of non stop, bloody, action.(But the subjectivity of the camera goes even further, to what characters feel; for ex. it shows Bell still feeding his romantic love while his couple has already bitten the dust. And what about Witt's stranded AWOL mate, whom he meets after visiting the village. Is he real, a dream, a ghost, a memory? Who knows). But Toll push for the hill is really more of a sub-plot. The real plot goes far deeper here and it's far more philosophical, encompassing and--as it was the case in AN--it comes synthesized in a simple image at the beginning, that of the submerging croc. Everything is there the beauty of Nature, but also its deadliness. Life and death. Light and darkness. Movement & stillness. Someone here mentioned Quantum Mechanics and by coincidence the same idea came to me while watching TTRL. Some kind of fluid, amorphous, indefinable emptiness, matter, from which everything originates at a given moment. That's the plot of the film, simply put. Life itself with all what it contains--and on which vast canvas a big painting is being created out of our everyday actions, misfortunes, sorrows; and in which ample wholeness war is only a singularity, as physicists say a small zone, a spot, on which the things happening all over also occur, but faster, more violently, deadly. (see, given enough time all these guys will be dead, won't they? And some will die as violently as here).When you watch the movie with this in mind, everything starts making sense. Life, Nature, War, are not logical, they rarely follow clear and well defined paths; paths satisfying our rational mind, with meanings, purposes, coherence. Instead they are usually random, nonsensical. One thing that irked James about war films is how their plots gen. unfold as if everything happening in them was logical, well thought--main characters rarely die, for ex.--and it's obvious Malick was listening. In TTRL nobody is untouchable, except Welsh, Witt, Bell, just because they have points to make. Others, privates, captains, colonels, come and go. And the action moves from one place to another with no clear blueprint, no defined outline. And the film itself appears as being conceived on the go, with the war still going, even if we imagine that somewhere a plan must exist. Of course, for this war they called that mysterious place the Pentagon; But for life itself we call that place Providence, or Destiny, Fate. We want to believe there's is a sense, a purpose for all this odyssey, somewhere. We just don't know where that place may be and who could be there, just like in a Kafka novel. That's why the film meanders from beginning to end in no particular direction, like a drunkard in a back alley. TTRL is not given to us so we can make sense of it, but as a sensual, spiritual gift so we may explore it, experience it.What I liked most in TTRL, besides its cinematography & score, is the acting. But not mainly in action sequences, or when characters are left alone with their own thoughts, but in dialogs. I found most dialogs great, some of them little gems by their own right, specially when Welsh talks with Witt and Tall with Staros. I had not seen Penn before, but I found his work superb here. I enjoyed each one of his lines, even more when some are great die, but with less noise! It's all about property! Even if Chaplin and Caviezel were the pivots, Penn chew ever bit of available scenery while on camera, closely followed at that by Nolte. They were the emotional foundations of the whole film--I'd say its extroverted part--while the other two played its introverted part dreams, memories, thoughts. 10\/10.As someone said here, if you are a checkers players instead of one of chess don't bother watching TTRL, as it may be well over your head. Just go watch SPR...and enjoy that popcorn. ","genre":null},{"date":"13 March 2011","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Superb piece of cinematographic art.
