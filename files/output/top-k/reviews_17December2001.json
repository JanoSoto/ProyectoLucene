The tots may enjoy themselves but parents will find themselves more entertained by their watches ticking away than Jimmy and his little friends.The plot is simple enough  all the parents are abducted by aliens and boy genius, Jimmy Neutron, is the only one with the brain power to get them back.  Maybe it was too simple.  The entire story was unimaginative and quite frankly, boring.  The key to a successful animated film is keeping the adults entertained as well as the children it's designed for.  In this, Jimmy Neutron  Boy Genius fails miserably.We're lead through a typical day in the life of Mr. Boy Wonder.  Being the shortest boy in his class, Jimmy takes a lot of ribbing from classmates. He gets a little too much grief from one girl in particular, Cindy Vortex. Jimmy is surrounded by his two best friends, Carl and Shane and his faithful mechanical dog, Goddard.  Carl is an overweight asthmatic and Shane is a little too obsessed with his favorite action figure, Ultra Lord.  Together with their classmates, they set out to take their parents back from the evil King Goobot and his idiot sidekick, Ooblar.This film couldn't even be saved by veteran actors, Patrick Stewart and Martin Short who voice King Goobot and Ooblar respectively.  Both were gobs of green goo with eyes, who traveled in hover vehicles.  Even the evil doers were unimaginative oafs.  The only thing I found remotely entertaining about Jimmy Neutron  Boy Genius was the soundtrack which included several '80s songs like She Blinded me with Science, We Got the Beat, and Kids in America.

Walt Disney always knew that even children have to hate the bad guys.  He also knew how to create a plucky hero.  Jimmy just doesn't cut the mustard. Humor is another ingredient Jimmy Neutron is lacking.

If you can remember the days when you had to stand for `God Save The Queen', they had a half time and only one screen at your local cinema, you'll love Monsters Inc.  The fact it starts off with a digital cartoon short will take you back to the heady days when Warner Bros. cartoons were the stock standard introduction to any movie.  Then you're thrown head long into the world of Monsters Inc., the company that provides electricity to the city of Monstropolis by collecting the energy generated by terrified children's screams.  The opening scene is pure genius, with a trainee scream collector as terrified of his victim as the child is of him.  But not all is what you think, with a nice twist thrown in right at the beginning.  The best scream catcher at the factory is Sulley (John Goodman), who we meet as he prepares for his day's work under the watchful eye (pun intended) of his trainer and mentor Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal).  At the plant he's everybody's hero, while chameleon like monster, Randall Boggs is obsessed with knocking him off his perch.  Things go awry when a small child enters the world of monsters.  The monsters are as terrified of children as children are of them, thinking that children carry terrible viruses that will destroy their hidden world.  But Sulley connects with the intruder, whom he names Boo, and decides it's up to him and Mike to save her.  That means getting her back through the closet door that will return her to the world of humans.  But it's easier said than done, with Randall and Monsters Inc. CEO, Henry J Waternoose, doing their best to banish Sulley and Mike while using Boo for their evil means.  Telling you too much more would spoil the story, but I can tell you, that since Disney are involved, it has a happy ending.    And that was the problem for me, not that I don't appreciate happy endings.  I found Monsters Inc. to be too schmaltzy for my taste.  The continual use of violins in the soundtrack became a little overbearing and were used as signposts to let you know that now was a good time to get emotional.  Perhaps the writers should have taken note of their own story line - that children don't scare as easily any more.  A few more scares and less sugar would have made a world of difference.  It also lacked the wit of Shrek - perhaps the best animated feature this year?  Now, please don't get me wrong and take it that Monsters Inc. is a bad movie; it's just that it could have been a lot better.  If you want to know what it could have been like, check out Real Monsters on Nickelodeon, a cartoon that has real wit for the adults and plenty of slapstick for the littlies.  But when it comes to the perfect kids movie for over the school holidays, you couldn't go far wrong with Monsters Inc.  Children will love the delightful, almost cuddly monsters that aren't really scary at all.  The animation is of the highest standard, with everyone of Sulley's hairs lovingly rendered and attention to the smallest details making the movie life like.    But perhaps the best thing about Monsters Inc. is that it will help your children realise that all those scary things that go bump in the night are just doing their job.

Don't ask me why, my mother has a card for the place and we got tickets.The film was directed by New Zealand director, Peter Jackson, who previously made Braindead, Bad Taste and Heavenly Creatures.The first impression of the film is that Jackson did a good job visually, but in his enthousiasm and personal interpretation screwed up the story. Anyone who has not read the book will probably be overwhelmed by this fantasy film and the amazing special effects in it. To one who knows the book, the film will be a missed opportunity to bring the story and especially the character development in Tolkien's work to the big screen.I will elaborate somewhat on all of these points. Visually, the film is overwhelming. From the cute homeliness of the Shire to the architecturals of Lothlorien to the tower of Orthanc in Isengard. From the hobbit 'look' to the Uruk-Hai, from Sauron's burning lidless eye to Galadriel's temptation, it looks stunning and the computer generated effects merge with the acting like few films have done before.The problem is mainly that the visual stuff receives too much attention. Jackson's roots in horror (even 'funny horror') are pretty obvious in this film. This is most evident in Bilbo's flash of rage when he cannot have the ring back in Rivendell. Very textbook horror film stuff. In the book, the mountain troll in the chamber of Mazarbul receives a wound in the foot and makes his exit after two lines. In the film, the Company fights it for five long minutes. The Watcher at the Hollin Gate does not come out of the water in the book. Silliest of all, the Balrog of Moria is a typical huge horned demon in the film and its arrival is announced in a very pompous fashion.The leads to the film's main flaws. First of all are the plot changes. Some of these are done in the interest of film length, such as cutting out the Old Forest and Tom Bombadil and most of the chase through the shire. The expanded role of Arwen is politically correcting but not of great consequence. Other things seriously screw up the storyIn the film, Saruman is enslaved by Sauron and the whole process of the transformation of Isengard to a mimic of the Dark Tower and the creation of the Uruk Hai is broadly displayed. In the book, Saruman is out for power of his own and just mentioning that Saruman mixed the vile race of orcs with those of man is evidence enough that he is up to no good. Nor is there a telekinetic battle in the book in which Saruman captures Gandalf. Jackson appears to want one single evil in charge and does not use the corrupting temptations of power by itself. Herein a human dimension of the book is lost.Reversely, in the film Isildur is tempted by the promise of power when he takes the ring, thereby causing the Numenoreans to fall from grace. In the book, the ring is much more subtle and Isildur keeps it as a token for his fallen brother and father. In the film this results in Boromir blatantly coveting the ring even at the council of Elrond and portraying him like a fool when he does not know Aragorn. Worst of all, Aragorn is changed into part fighting machine (fighting off the five Nazgul at Weathertop singlehandedly) and part angelic Messiah (not being tempted by the ring and sending Frodo off to Mordor alone with a sorrowful smile).The third case is that in the film Saruman and Gandalf know of the Balrog of Moria, which is not in the book, nor does Gimli in the book invite them to Uncle Balin's mines. In the book, Gimli came to Rivendell to get word of Balin's mission to recapture Moria. The final thing to mention here is that in the film, the interplay between Gimli and Galadriel is entirely discarded, while in the book this contributes greatly to the friendship between Gimli and Legolas. All in all it makes the group hug at the end when they set after Pippin and Merry come out of thin air.The end result, to which other factors contribute is that many of the subtleties in the book are utterly lost. The One Ring actively talks to everyone and gets on people much more blatantly than in the book. Galadriel is portrayed like the Elven witch that rumour in the outside world would have her be. The Elves and Dwarves bicker openly at the first opportunity, rather than mistrusting each other because they are unfamiliar with each other.The saddest thing is that most of this could have been fixed easily. Galadriel could have had three more sentences at the Mirror, and all would be explained and within the storyline of the book. At least some attention could have been paid to the motivations of the characters, particularly for Frodo, Sam and Aragorn, but for all of the Fellowship to some degree. Kindness, doubt and grief at the many losses are a major part of the book but the film has just made no time for it.Instead, Jackson chose an action heavy film, thereby degrading a great book of fiction to an ordinary fantasy novel. The focus is on the visual horrors they encounter and the characters are propelled by some inbuilt fate or else by Elrond's mission decree. While I have seen worse, the source material has so much more debt that I cannot but call this film a sorely missed opportunity to bring Tolkien's book to life.

The Elves and Dwarves bicker openly at the first opportunity, rather than mistrusting each other because they are unfamiliar with each other.The saddest thing is that most of this could have been fixed easily. Galadriel could have had three more sentences at the Mirror, and all would be explained and within the storyline of the book. At least some attention could have been paid to the motivations of the characters, particularly for Frodo, Sam and Aragorn, but for all of the Fellowship to some degree. Kindness, doubt and grief at the many losses are a major part of the book but the film has just made no time for it.Instead, Jackson chose an action heavy film, thereby degrading a great book of fiction to an ordinary fantasy novel. The focus is on the visual horrors they encounter and the characters are propelled by some inbuilt fate or else by Elrond's mission decree. While I have seen worse, the source material has so much more debt that I cannot but call this film a sorely missed opportunity to bring Tolkien's book to life.

Given that Soderbergh dared to defile Ocean's Eleven I guess we had better not speak to loud or it may come to pass.

Here is the basic punchline of this one-joke comedy (if that's what you consider it)  The main character, Pootie Tang, blurts out a bunch of words and phrases that no one understands but the characters in the story.  Oh, my God!  You must be falling out your seat laughing!!!  Now, we had the character of Farmer Fran in The Waterboy who did the same routine, but it worked.  First of all, Blake Clark is a much better comic actor than Lance Crouthers--and has a barotone voice that alone makes you crack up.  And second, he wasn't the main character, so the joke wasn't played out to tedium.  Even a silly joke has to make some sort of sense.  In one scene, Pootie is in a recording studio, recording his new song.  He asks the studio executive to turn down the sound.  So what we hear is...nothing!  Literally nothing!  And everyone goes crazy over Pootie's new single!  It's the talk of the town!  A song that composes of nothing!  OK, so Seinfeld (my favorite show of all time) was a show about nothing, but it's the kind of nothing everyone can relate to.  Everyday characters in everyday situations who go through normal, everyday routines.  I try to be gentle with comedies, but if a comedy doesn't make you laugh--what do you have??  I've seen stupid comedies before that made me laugh out loud (i.e.  Dirty Work, Saving Silverman), but this is just plain stupidity!  Where's the laughs?  Damned if I know. I've never watched The Chris Rock Show (don't have premium cable), but I hope the sketches on his show is a lot funnier than this disastrous vehicle.  Louis C.K.

Chris is a talented comedian, but with material this lame he couldn't even milk any humor out of each scene.  And what the hell is up with Robert Vaughn??  This formerly respectable actor has only turned up in roles in campy comedies like this over the past years.  First he was in Joe's Apartment.  OK, I found that movie oddly appealing, but he still had a thankless, embarrassing role.  Then it was Baseketball.  And now Pootie Tang!  Wanda Sykes is also a regular on Chris' show and unfortunately she had to be dragged into this project, just like with Chris' other disastrous comedy Down to Earth.  I like Wanda, I've seen her stand-up acts and she is absolutely hilarious.  But even she couldn't bring out any laughs.  This is the kind of camp that doesn't even have potential to become a cult classic.  I'm sure everyone who participated in this project, twenty years from now, will probably make sure every copy of this film is burned.

In both of those they pushed the humor right up to the point where it became distasteful, but never crossed that line. However, in Me, Myself, and Irene, they crossed the line early and often, and converted what started out as a good premise into a very bad movie.

Kristen Dunst deserves an Oscar for her work in this movie. She captivated me and made me just want to reach through the screen and give her a hug. Jay Hernendez also played a great role and it seemed Jay and Kristen's chemistry made the movie that much better. I am a 21 year old Male and I am a hopeless romantic. I have loved Shes all that, 10 things I hate about you, Loser, but after watching this movie and the depth it went to with really not much comedy, much more on the drama side, I must admit I don't think those other movies I mentioned will be quite as good as I once thought they were after watching this movie. Do yourself a favor and skip renting this movie. Go out and buy it if you can find it. Add it to your collection of movies you will watch again and again. You will not be disappointed. A+ Effort from the whole cast and whoever wrote the movie deserves much credit. Hope this review helped!
