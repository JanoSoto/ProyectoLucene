To be honest, I just wasn't interested in it and I did watch it in a very good mood. I was excited because I love these action flicks, they're very exciting and fun to watch. But Rambo just didn't have his edge any more in my opinion. Yes, he's supposed to be emotionless, but it seemed like Sylvester didn't get into the actual role of Rambo this time. With a change of events when in the first Rambo movie the Colernal saves Rambo from himself, Rambo now must save the Colernal from getting killed by Russian terrorists. Good idea, right? Well, it seemed so, but it just flopped. I know this is also a little off subject, but it also didn't seem politically correct by today's standards, I know! I know! This was an 80's movie, how could they possibly know what Afghanastan is today? But still, I kind of snickered at the end when they had a dedicated to message.I mean over all, this wasn't the worst movie I had ever seen. But it's just not that good either, like I said, Rambo completely lost his edge and doesn't seem that cool any more. Sylvester needs to relax and get off the ego trip, we already know how tough he is, he doesn't need to try so hard. So, I'd recommend this film if you want to finish the Rambo trilogy, otherwise it's not really worth your time.3\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 December 2005","score":"6 out of 12 people found the following review useful","review":" Well, I was kind of disappointed with the third Rambo.

Along the way they meet some strange and interesting people and creatures, and get into all sorts of problems.Monthy Python and the Holy Grail is a comedy classic.

The Black Knight and his dismembering appendages, never giving up a fight despite any wound he incurs. The Frnech Guard taunting Arthur and his Knight; with a outrageous accent, saying they already have a Grail, to which Arthur and his Knights make a trogan horse; forgetting the all important point of being inside the horse. Sir Galahad stumbling upon the Castle Anthrax; full of sex deprived women. Sir Lancelot and his blood soaked rampage to save a trapped prince. The Knight who say Ni, Tim the Enchantor, the killer rabbit and so many more.The animation by Terry Gilliam that is spliced into the film works to great effect; giving it extra Monty Phython feel, the animation has that Gilliam aesthetic of surrealism. The acting is just wonderful. Yes that it is over acted, but it suits it perfectly. Its great how they played most of the characters themselves, showing a range of personalities and acting abilities. The film is basically a line of skits, but they have connected them really well and made them run at a constant flow, always keeping the laughs coming. Some of the running jokes through the film don't lose any punch or humor, which many running jokes in other films fall flat by the end.
