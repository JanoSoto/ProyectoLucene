We meet Ben (Hoffman) who is shown to be a shy and an introvert,He just graduated and is a prize student with a brilliant future. At his Celebration party Mrs. Robinson a family friend asks Ben to take her home, there she tries to seduce this extremely shy, introverted virgin. She doesn't succeed but plant the idea and Ben falls for it. They began to have an affair. Meanwhile Mr.Robinson is trying to set up his daughter (who doesn't have many friends) with Ben, who has no interest her, then when his parents also get involved he decides to amuse his parents and not get in an uncomfortable situation with his mistress and his parents. At the same time Mrs. Robinson states very clearly that she doesn't want him to date her daughter, but pushes to more of a reason then just not sharing her young meat with her daughter. After putting Elaine through the worst date he apologizes and falls for her in a matter of seconds, as she does for him. Then the whole story falls apart, Ben goes from Introvert to an extrovert, Elaine goes from a shy and innocent Pure like girl goes to a socially confident woman who has friends and a boyfriend. Ben after losing Elaine to the truth, decides his only choice is to marry her. Elaine who had 1 date with Ben and falls in love with him, doesn't tell him about her other boyfriend who proposed to her. When Elaine's parents find out about Ben's plan to marry her, they decide to marry her off to her boyfriend the next day. Question implies, why did Elaine fall for a Jerk? a guy who was having an affair with a married woman. and later a guy who was accused of raping her mother. But bigger question is why did she agree to getting married to the other guy and going through with it, if she loved Ben? The film might be a classic due to its Acting, Dustin Hoffman was brilliant as a 20-21 year old shy graduate student, and more importantly Anne Bancroft was simply amazing as the much older mother, (she is actually only 6 years older the Hoffman) but the story lacked gravity and emotion, it lacked logic and timing. So this was just a fake classic that people loved for the idea of being forgiven and the idea that true love conquers all.

He can shock us, disturb us, magnetize us; but all traumas are wrapped up in a quasi-cool package, kept swirling around in pulp noir fantasy. Recurring in Mann's films, or at least the ones I've seen, is the persistent distinction that, while the atmosphere may look like a colorized Kiss Me Deadly, something much, much bleaker lurks beneath the surface.Esteem goes much farther than an emotional connection when it comes to a Mann picture like Lynch's Lost Highway or Antonioni's Red Desert, sitting back and getting lost in the thickly spread luster is much easier a task than walking out of the theater moved, tears streaming down our faces from the penetrative emotions thrown about left and right. We're left cold, drowning in the sorrows of the characters, suffocated by the elusive sheen of Mann's camera-work. Manhunter, a thriller that initially introduced the world to Hannibal Lecter (rebranded Lecktor here), is a rather aloof serial killer suspense drama, murderous in its tension but icy in its pathos.William Petersen plays Will Graham, a retired FBI profiler lying low after a gruesome attack by cannibalistic murderer Hannibal Lecktor (Brian Cox). His resting period is cut rather short, however, when he is approached by his former superior (Dennis Farina), who is in desperate need of help. A new serial killer, billed The Tooth Fairy, is wreaking havoc on the area, slaughtering families at random in hopes to attain some sort of mental catharsis. With Graham's chilling ability to put himself into the mind of the person under investigation, he very well could be a valuable asset. So reluctantly, knowing he could very well end future killings, he accepts the blood-stained invitation, aided by the now-jailed Lecktor.The interest Manhunter provides steadily increases, especially after it introduces The Tooth Fairy himself (spoiler warning). As Francis Dollarhyde, Tom Noonan is convincingly disturbed, so much so that we see him as a psychologically scarred monster, not a two- dimensional one that so many serial killer based movies provide us with. He is a victim of a neglectful society; all he ever wanted was for someone to like him. I suppose the most problematic fixture in Manhunter is Dollarhyde; he is the only character that holds immense interest. Noonan is so dedicated, so expressive that we fear that reading too much into his performance would ruin his startlingly effective capacity to freak us the f-ck out. Petersen, on the other hand, is much too understated to be believably haunted by his past, while Kim Greist and Joan Allen, two magnificent actresses, are wasted in roles too small to go anywhere. But the film is dripping with style, and when the writing fails to move, the cinematography takes the spotlight and galvanizes what's left of glass-littered-on-the-ground reality. Mann's excessive tinting works well here dark blues wash out scenes of comfort, of love; greens, pinks, and oranges hint at imminent threat. Even the score, mostly consisting of synthetic, distinctly '80s mood pieces, heighten Mann's hallucinogenic embellishments.Manhunter is entertainment of the highest quality, subversively stylish, intelligently directed; but it remains so brisk, so distant, that even the slimmest thrill is brought to entirely new levels because it somehow feels more hospitable than everything coming before its insertion.

None of the various story lines are terribly interesting and I think that the kissing cousins plot was a dreadful idea. The best parts of the film are the scenes between Al Pacino and Diane Keaton, who play the tense relationship between Michael and Kay very well, but their performances are not on the same level as in the first two films. This would not have been a major problem if the film had been better but it places far too much reliance on the previous films to the point that it is difficult to fully understand or even care about the characters and events if you are not familiar with them. I wasn't very interested in the idea of Michael's quest for redemption but could have been handled far better. The film was nominated for Best Picture but I don't think that it deserved to be. It felt more like someone else trying to emulate the Godfather films than a true Godfather film itself. For instance, the intertwining of the killings with the opera performance was a failed attempt to recreate the brilliant baptism scene of the first film. At 2 hours and 50 minutes, it was far too long and very badly paced. Honestly, my favourite line in the film is when Joey Zasa says, And we got Don Ameche, who played the guy that invented the telephone since Ameche is one of my all time favourite actors.The best newcomers are the always brilliant Eli Wallach, Joe Mantegna and Donal Donnelly. George Hamilton and Bridget Fonda are wasted. Robert Duvall's absence is extremely noticeable and Andy Garcia, who is not a very good actor, is just forgettable as Vincent. Sofia Coppola's performance as Mary Corleone is pretty horrific but much of the blame has to be attributed to her father Francis Ford Coppola for casting her. He should have been able to see that she could not act to save her life. One of her lines - delivered atrociously - is Dad, why are you doing this to me? I'd have said the same thing in real life if I were her. Coppola's well known propensity for nepotism proved successful in the casting of his sister Talia Shire in this trilogy - she has more screen time in this film than the first two combined but far less interesting material, incidentally - and his nephew Nicolas Cage in Peggy Sue Got Married. However, after Winona Ryder dropped out of this film, it would have probably been a good idea if he looked for an actress outside of his immediate family to replace her. Overall, this is not a dreadful or even a particularly bad one. It's just dull. However, I don't think that this is a film that needed to be made. This is the weakest final entry in a film trilogy that I have ever seen. It's certainly for the best that The Godfather Part IV was never made.

The first full-length animated film, for a few brief years the highest-grossing film of all time and still to this day one of the most successful films in Disney history. Still the most successful if you account for inflation. And there is a reason for all that success, and not just the fact that it was the first. It's the crown of Walt Disney Studios. There might be gems that shined brighter later on, but this is the base, the foundation of the studio's brilliance.And no, it's not a perfect film. You can still see that the animators were still learning away from the brief animated shorts they were more used to doing. The whole film is very episodic, with most of the time spent on general gallivanting and merriment. Especially with the dwarfs. There's a whole segment dedicated to them washing their hands. Actually, I lie. There's a whole segment AND a song dedicated to it. And sure, the dwarfs are great character, each a unique personality with hiccups and all, so the viewer doesn't really mind that the plot is pretty much forgotten much of the time, but you can nevertheless see that it's a work in progress as far as feature length storytelling is concerned.Luckily we have the Queen. And oh, what a way to introduce us to Disney villains. To this day she's one of the greats and it can be argued that the movie is actually about her, not Snow White nor the dwarfs. She's the first character we see, has pretty much the most dialogue and her scenes are the most captivating and actually move the plot forward. And she's a menace. Always plotting, scheming, cackling, being absolutely terrifying.

F. W. Murnau&#x97;a prominent figure in the German expressionist movement of the 1920s&#x97;is widely regarded as one of the most influential filmmakers of the silent era. Nosferatu, also known as Nosferatu&#x96;A Symphony of Horror, stars Max Schreck as the vampire Count Orlok. Murnau's Nosferatu was supposed to be an adaptation of Bram Stoker's 1897 epic vampire extravaganza, Dracula, but after the studio failed to procure the rights of the book from Stoker's widow, the names and other details were deliberately adjusted so as to avoid the hassles of copyright infringement. However, this deviation was not enough to deceive the court, which gave its verdict in the favor of Stoker's widow. After the film studio (Prana Film) declared its bankruptcy, the court instructed to destroy all the existing prints of Nosferatu. If it wouldn't have been for the one surviving copy of the film, which had already been distributed all around the world, we would have surely been deprived of the privilege of savoring this true gem of cinema.What makes Murnau's Nosferatu remarkable, in comparison to the countless other renditions, is that apart from keeping the eerie feeling of Stoker's Dracula intact it also succeeds in doing away with the theatrical gimmicks (that can offer tear apart an entire narrative), thus relying heavily on the development of its characters as well as its plot. This enriches Murnau's characters with an inherent sense of realism that the characters in the book's other cinematic renditions are so ostentatiously devoid of. Max Schreck's Count Orlok, in exact contract to the character's future portrayals on the celluloid, is what he is supposed to be a cursed creature depraved by centuries of hapless suffering and solitude, who obviously lacks the glamour of a celebrated vampire being made to bask in the glory of his own grandeur.One vampire movie that comes very close to Murnau's Nosferatu in its expression of horro is E. Elias Merhige's metafiction horror film, Shadow of the Vampire (2000). The movie, coincidentally, shares a more intimate relation with Nosferatu, for it narrates a fictionalized account of the filming of Murnau's 1922 epic. The movie stars John Malkovich as F. W. Murnau and Willem Dafoe as Count Orlok. The beauty of Merhige's Shadow of the Vampire is that it serves two different purposes at the same time It triumphantly presents a fictionalized account of the making of Nosferatu. And, it also serves to be a Gothic horror film of its own. Malkovich's Murnau comes across as a meticulous filmmaker who seems so obsessed about his art that he wouldn't think twice about sacrificing his cast and crew members in order to fulfill his artistic vision. Dafoe's Count Orlok is an actor so committed to his act that he wouldn't leave a single stone unturned in order to bring the Gothic vampire to life. While Dafoe's masterful performance resonates with Max Schreck's iconic portrayal, John Malkovich's F. W. Murnau has all the qualities of becoming the cinematic archetype of a mad artist obsessed with his art.Over the last nine decades, Nosferatu has not only enjoyed a strong cult following, but has received overwhelmingly positive reviews. Renowned film critic Roger Ebert writes in his review of Nosferatu, To watch F.W. Murnau's 'Nosferatu'' is to see the vampire movie before it had really seen itself. Here is the story of Dracula before it was buried alive in clichés, jokes, TV skits, cartoons and more than 30 other films. The film is in awe of its material. It seems to really believe in vampires. Over the years, Stoker's Count Dracula has enjoyed an unprecedented following, one that is matched only by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's super-sleuth, Sherlock Holmes, with Stoker's Gothic super-villain making a major appearance in more than 200 films. Suffice it is to say that the universal popularity of Stoker's Dracula owes a colossal debt to Murnau's Nosferatu, which not only made Stoker's epic vampire saga a household phenomenon, but also immortalized Stoker's vampire as the supreme symbol of Gothic terror in the world of cinema. Even today, Murnau's Nosferatu serves as a great means to get acquainted with Stoker's timeless tale of terror. Nosferatu still continues to be unparalleled in its demonstration of unrestrained terror in the world of cinema.

It is extremely evocative of the films of Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock and the film noir classics of the 1940s and 1950s. There is a wonderful reference to Citizen Kane in the scene in which Mike Church visits the elderly Gray Baker in a nursing home for information and he repeatedly asks for tobacco, as the elderly Jed Leland did in that film. The flawless and completely engrossing script was written by Scott Frank, who more recently wrote the decidedly lacklustre The Wolverine. It is full of fantastic twists and marvellous dialogue. The cinematography is beautiful and the long uninterrupted takes, one of Branagh's trademarks, are brilliantly done, the best example being the first hypnosis scene. I have always been very nervous of knives and large scissors - perhaps I had a bad experience with them in a past life too! - so I found those parts of the film, particularly the denouement, extremely frightening. It took a few minutes after the film ended for my heart rate to return to normal.Branagh excels not only as a director but an actor too, playing the dual roles of Roman Strauss and Mike Church to perfection. The same is true of his then wife Emma Thompson as Margaret Strauss and Grace. It's a shame that they got divorced as their on screen chemistry is always electric, never more so than in Much Ado About Nothing. The best performance in the film, however, comes from Derek Jacobi who is spellbinding as Franklyn Madson, particularly towards the end of the film. He was nominated for the BAFTA for Best Supporting Actor and should have received an Oscar nomination for the equivalent award. The film is pretty much dominated by those three actors but it also has strong performances from Wayne Knight, Robin Williams (in one of his first completely serious roles) and Hanna Schygulla. As I said in my review of The Godfather Part III, I don't think that Andy García is a great actor but he was certainly better than in that film as he was given far more interesting material in spite of his far more limited screen time. That brings me to my only real criticism of the film the old age make-up that he wore was rubbish. There is also a lovely and hilarious cameo by an uncredited Miriam Margoyles but Branagh's mascot Richard Briers is conspicuously absent.Overall, this is my second favourite film directed by Branagh after Hamlet and one of the best thrillers that I have ever seen.

There is also a lovely and hilarious cameo by an uncredited Miriam Margoyles but Branagh's mascot Richard Briers is conspicuously absent.Overall, this is my second favourite film directed by Branagh after Hamlet and one of the best thrillers that I have ever seen. ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"30 May 2015","score":"","review":" Kenneth Branagh's second film as a director, this is an absolutely superb thriller which could hardly be more different from Henry V. It is extremely evocative of the films of Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock and the film noir classics of the 1940s and 1950s. There is a wonderful reference to Citizen Kane in the scene in which Mike Church visits the elderly Gray Baker in a nursing home for information and he repeatedly asks for tobacco, as the elderly Jed Leland did in that film. The flawless and completely engrossing script was written by Scott Frank, who more recently wrote the decidedly lacklustre The Wolverine. It is full of fantastic twists and marvellous dialogue. The cinematography is beautiful and the long uninterrupted takes, one of Branagh's trademarks, are brilliantly done, the best example being the first hypnosis scene. I have always been very nervous of knives and large scissors - perhaps I had a bad experience with them in a past life too! - so I found those parts of the film, particularly the denouement, extremely frightening. It took a few minutes after the film ended for my heart rate to return to normal.Branagh excels not only as a director but an actor too, playing the dual roles of Roman Strauss and Mike Church to perfection. The same is true of his then wife Emma Thompson as Margaret Strauss and Grace. It's a shame that they got divorced as their on screen chemistry is always electric, never more so than in Much Ado About Nothing. The best performance in the film, however, comes from Derek Jacobi who is spellbinding as Franklyn Madson, particularly towards the end of the film. He was nominated for the BAFTA for Best Supporting Actor and should have received an Oscar nomination for the equivalent award. The film is pretty much dominated by those three actors but it also has strong performances from Wayne Knight, Robin Williams (in one of his first completely serious roles) and Hanna Schygulla.

Both scenes (in very different ways, that's for sure), convey human interaction in pre-Babbel form, two scenes that don't lean on language and make us feel good and evil in their purest form, in this tale where Men returns to the Wild and, therefore, must be confronted with it.'Deliverance' is a downbeat adventure drama film directed by John Boorman in 1972, starring Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox as the four city men who trade their golf weekend for a canoe adventure down the Cahulawassee River in Southern U.S., before this last piece of native, wild America disappears underwater after the construction of a dam. But things start to unravel for the four adventurers, who soon find themselves fighting for survival on a land where civilization laws are not applicable.Cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond does a tremendous job capturing the beautiful wild, landscape in tones of green and smooth gold. The four main actors are all up to the characters they play, as proved by the scenes when moral discussion arises and each of them must make their point on the subject. The soundtrack is minimal and mostly replicate the Nature sounds that surround our four men on their adventure, with some keys of banjo here and there, which really helps to delve in the story.In sum, 'Deliverance' is an effective adventure film, which counts with great photography, interpretations and soundtrack to convey a story of instinct and survival over civilization, where good and evil are shown in their most raw form and every major plot event is pondered and brings irreversible consequences for the future.

The original ending would have featured Andie ending up with Duckie instead of Blane but it was changed over Hughes' objections. I really wish that it hadn't been as it would have been a stronger ending as Duckie cares about Andie far more than Blane does. In an interview for the film's 25th anniversary, Jon Cryer and Molly Ringwald said that they thought that Andie and Blane would have broken up soon after the events of the film but she and Duckie would have remained lifelong friends. They also thought that Duckie would have long since come out. I'm going to imagine that that is exactly what happened.However, I can't fault the film's cast. Molly Ringwald and Andrew McCarthy are very natural in the leading roles while Cryer is very sweet as Duckie and James Spader is suitably smarmy as Steff. The great character actor Harry Dean Stanton is excellent in the supporting role of Andie's heartbroken father Jack but Annie Potts steals the show as Iona, who has all the best lines. It also features an early role for Kate Vernon as the catty Bunny and very small appearances by Kirsty Swanson and Gina Gershon. Sadly, Alexa Kanin, who played Andie's friend Jenna, died at the age of 23 several months before the film was released and it is dedicated to her memory.

It's a Twinkie of a movie - a momentary sugar high with no nutritional value whatsoever.Yet, I can't help but like it. Empire Records is the kind of cheerfully brainless movie you watch when you're sick or you can't sleep. When you're too stressed to take anything of any substance, its high-spirited, empty-headed charm is pretty soothing, like comfort food or a pair of well-worn sweat pants. Sometimes you need to watch a stupid movie; when you feel such a need, Empire Records is just what the doctor ordered.Empire Records doesn't have a story so much as a series of vignettes held together by a thin plot device the titular record store, which is about to go out of business. The store is staffed by a motley group of Pretty White Kids With Problems who listen to inoffensively edgy alternative rock (Gin Blossoms, the Cranberries, etc). They spend their day in the store angsting over unrequited love, musing about movies and bands, and having the obligatory life-changing revelations. (This keeps them too busy to do any actual work; not once do you see anyone so much as clean the bathroom.) They then throw a big party that miraculously saves the store, and everybody finds love and happiness. The end.I know, it's ridiculous. Empire Records redefines the word stupid. Nevertheless, every time I see this movie I can't help but smile.

At that moment in our lives, they gave us what was then the ultimate gift the fantasy of being forever young, beautiful and hip. Most people eventually outgrow the need to be cool, but when you're a teenager, it's like oxygen. Empire Records brings us back to an idealized version of that time, and the nostalgia washes over us in a wave of warm fuzzies. If a movie can do that, it doesn't need to be good.Empire Records may not be a good movie in the strictest sense, but I can watch it with a smile on my face, even if I forget about it moments after I finish watching it.
