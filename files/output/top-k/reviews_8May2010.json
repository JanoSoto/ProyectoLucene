Magnolia is about as big a movie as you can imagine, and often in danger of slipping off the tracks, but watching it is an immersive experience you will not soon forget - or want to.How to summarize? Um, okay, there are these people in various states of life, dealing with various boiling points in idiosyncratic fashion. A cop (John C. Reilly) is trying to make time with a girl on the edge (Melora Walters). An ultra-bright child (Jeremy Blackman) suffers from humiliation on live television. A TV producer (Jason Robards) lies dying while his huckster son (Tom Cruise) lives in misogynistic denial. And on and on, various tangents threaded loosely but intrinsically together. Eventually, the whole thing reaches a critical mass, with even the sky weighing in to pass judgment.No description of Magnolia can do justice to the experience of taking it in. That's not meant altogether as praise. Making its subject a day in the life of assorted people with often tangential connections becomes a license for narrative sprawl and cinematic excess. There's too much shouting and dramatic underscoring. A plot point involving a murder is casually dumped for lack of time. Emotions are ramped up, especially when Julianne Moore is on screen as Robards' wife, freaking out without letup. Moore is a great actress, but she's not great here.About everyone else is great, though all have their moments of excess. It's the price you pay for their company. Cruise nails his part with Christian Bale zeal, getting under the bone with what might be called Jerry Maguire's evil twin. His advice to a pack of wolf-whistling lonely men is to be a total dog with women, in a series of lessons that include How To Fake Like You Are Nice And Caring and How To Turn Your 'Friend' Into Your Sperm Receptacle.Anderson and cinematographer Robert Elswit create a dizzying array of masterful shots, with crane views, quick pans that stop on a dime, and a series of long tracking shots on the set of the hyper-tense game show What Do Kids Know? It's show-off bravado, yes, but incredibly engaging work that makes a three-hour-ten-minute movie zoom by like a music video.Anderson's not just a plate-spinner but an artist of empathy and depth. Watching Robards dying of cancer (it's the character he plays, Earl Partridge, who is dying, but Robards himself would be dead just over a year after the film's release) makes me flash on my own father's last days, and his brave performance makes for grueling, cathartic viewing.What is the film about? With all due respect to the Book of Exodus and an opening sequence advancing the idea nothing is coincidental, the core message seems to be about love. Love is a rebellious bird that nobody can tame and it's all in vain to call it if it chooses to refuse is a quote from Bizet's Carmen used here, perhaps a nod in the direction of another movie about childhood heartbreak in Southern California, The Bad News Bears. Watching people deal with love, and its nasty flip side, regret, is a continued subject of Magnolia, and, in the end, its one enduring if uncertain grace note.But summarizing this film, as I said, is an exercise in futility. Watching it can be painful, too, and confusing in ways a tighter focus might have solved. But this is a film you feel in your bones, to the point where it may have you replaying scenes in your head. Not a perfect film, but a singular experience, Magnolia is for the heart and head. ","genre":null},{"date":"8 May 2010","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" P.T.
