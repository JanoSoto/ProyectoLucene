In contrast, the movie could have been much shorter, not by cutting out details or facts, but by cutting some of the shots. The editing at some points slowed down the energy of the film and sometimes was almost boring. Does watching young people (and Spike Lee) dance around for 15 minutes get a point across? Do we really have to stare at Denzel Washington's face as he looks off into space and thinks for as long as we do? Not really. And the ending is very very drawn out. Once you think it is over, there is more clips from the civil rights movement (which is very important and was perfect to have in the film where it was, but could have been so much shorter and much more concise), and when that is done you think oh wow what an awes- there's more?!?!?! and there is a clip with a bunch of kids saying I am Malcolm X! really loudly, and when that goes on for what feels like 2 more hours, then Nelson Mandela is there. What? But eventually it ends and you have almost forgot what you were going to say about how much you loved it. Having said that, Lee used lighting to separate the different phases of Malcolm's life in a truly genius way. He shoots the whole first part of the film in a soft, fuzzy, Old Hollywood light, which makes it all feel very dream like and, we realize later, shows how surreal and blinded Malcolm's early life was. It is colorful and fun, like an old gangster movie, but better because it proves a point. Following that, when Malcolm is in jail, the lights and colors are exactly the opposite. It is close to black and white at that point, and everything is hard, sharp, defined, and dramatic. Later still, when Malcolm is in the Nation of Islam and growing is status, we finally see the world in a clear, unaltered way, like how Malcolm is no longer blinded by the white man. It feels like we just put on glasses after not even realizing we couldn't see and everything comes into focus. The rest of the film is shot in this manner until the very end. Overall, this movie is a work of art that need to be played for every human being who thinks they know anything about the world. It is very important and is masterfully crafted. Good Stuff. I promise.

Hands down Schwarzenegger's best movie ","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"7 December 2014","score":"","review":" Spike Lee brings several of the very important themes and ideas that appear in The Autobiography of Malcolm X into focus and to a new level in his epic biography Malcolm X. In the autobiography, as told to Alex Haley, readers typically only experience events through Malcolm's eyes as he goes through his every day life, seeing what Malcolm sees and hearing his thoughts. The film, on the other hand, transcends Malcolm's mind and not only gives viewers his take on the world but also provides perspectives and emotions from multiple points of view, which pushes viewers to a deeper understanding of Malcolm X's positions and more direct confrontation of the tensions of race conflicts in the USA. In the film, Lee spends the first portion of the movie glorifying Malcolm's hustler life through exaggerated composition to highlight the contrast between reality, shown in flashbacks, and the pretend world of the hustle. The characters' movements, the almost constant upbeat and jazzy non-diegetic music, the soft focus background, and the surrounding calm and happy colors with an almost orange filter almost make the scenes look unrealistic. Lee's creative use of this exaggerated composition helps to set up the delusion of the white world hustler Malcolm lives in. For instance in one scene, Washington (Malcolm) and Lee himself (Shorty) are running through the park enclosed by soft and happy colors and non-diegetic jazzy music with their conked hair and zoot suits, adopting white mainstream cultural influences with pretending to be  Cops and Robbers and taking on the roles of white actors of the time. Lee's composition in these scenes purposefully contrasts with the reality of Malcolm's real, early-life experiences. The only time the viewers get a hint of the reality of Malcolm's actual past is when Lee cuts to choppy, fast, and somewhat confusing scenes flashback scenes. In these flashbacks the viewers get thrown into a direct contrast to the previous shots of the hustler life Malcolm was living and his future life as a Muslim minister. There is more low-key lighting and a darker, vintage filter, helping viewers understand that these shots are serious and realistic and they present what Lee wants the audience to understand that Malcolm is running away from. Moreover, the only time the non-diegetic sound (upbeat soundtrack) stops in the flashbacks and viewers are left with the somber feeling created by the uncomfortable diegetic sound. Spike Lee also does an amazing job of juxtaposing Malcolm's false hustler reality with the flashback of his father's death, an actual event. Viewers get a clip of a long angle and medium shot of Malcolm's father's battered and bloody face surrounded by low-key lighting except for the line of light coming from the train. The viewers see the fear and pain in his face as the whistle of the speeding train rushes toward him causing his demise. The use of these contrasting techniques serves to exaggerate the idea that Malcolm is living in a false world as a hustler. Likewise, later depictions in the film of Malcolm's life after jail, the shots, filters, and sound continue to contrast with Lee's use of them in the hustler days part of the film. Lee's use of these contrasting techniques is not simply to speed along the story for the purposes of fitting it into a movie. Instead, Lee masterfully uses the techniques to symbolically demonstrate that by attempting to live in a white man's world and being forced to respond to the systemic racism in society, Malcolm had to pretend to be something and someone he was not until he came to understand that he needed to fight that pressure.

Lee's techniques throughout the film evoke a strong emotional response and resonance for viewers that the written autobiography cannot. ","genre":null},{"date":"7 December 2014","score":"","review":" Spike Lee brings several of the very important themes and ideas that appear in The Autobiography of Malcolm X into focus and to a new level in his epic biography Malcolm X. In the autobiography, as told to Alex Haley, readers typically only experience events through Malcolm's eyes as he goes through his every day life, seeing what Malcolm sees and hearing his thoughts. The film, on the other hand, transcends Malcolm's mind and not only gives viewers his take on the world but also provides perspectives and emotions from multiple points of view, which pushes viewers to a deeper understanding of Malcolm X's positions and more direct confrontation of the tensions of race conflicts in the USA. In the film, Lee spends the first portion of the movie glorifying Malcolm's hustler life through exaggerated composition to highlight the contrast between reality, shown in flashbacks, and the pretend world of the hustle. The characters' movements, the almost constant upbeat and jazzy non-diegetic music, the soft focus background, and the surrounding calm and happy colors with an almost orange filter almost make the scenes look unrealistic. Lee's creative use of this exaggerated composition helps to set up the delusion of the white world hustler Malcolm lives in. For instance in one scene, Washington (Malcolm) and Lee himself (Shorty) are running through the park enclosed by soft and happy colors and non-diegetic jazzy music with their conked hair and zoot suits, adopting white mainstream cultural influences with pretending to be  Cops and Robbers and taking on the roles of white actors of the time. Lee's composition in these scenes purposefully contrasts with the reality of Malcolm's real, early-life experiences. The only time the viewers get a hint of the reality of Malcolm's actual past is when Lee cuts to choppy, fast, and somewhat confusing scenes flashback scenes. In these flashbacks the viewers get thrown into a direct contrast to the previous shots of the hustler life Malcolm was living and his future life as a Muslim minister. There is more low-key lighting and a darker, vintage filter, helping viewers understand that these shots are serious and realistic and they present what Lee wants the audience to understand that Malcolm is running away from. Moreover, the only time the non-diegetic sound (upbeat soundtrack) stops in the flashbacks and viewers are left with the somber feeling created by the uncomfortable diegetic sound. Spike Lee also does an amazing job of juxtaposing Malcolm's false hustler reality with the flashback of his father's death, an actual event. Viewers get a clip of a long angle and medium shot of Malcolm's father's battered and bloody face surrounded by low-key lighting except for the line of light coming from the train. The viewers see the fear and pain in his face as the whistle of the speeding train rushes toward him causing his demise. The use of these contrasting techniques serves to exaggerate the idea that Malcolm is living in a false world as a hustler. Likewise, later depictions in the film of Malcolm's life after jail, the shots, filters, and sound continue to contrast with Lee's use of them in the hustler days part of the film. Lee's use of these contrasting techniques is not simply to speed along the story for the purposes of fitting it into a movie. Instead, Lee masterfully uses the techniques to symbolically demonstrate that by attempting to live in a white man's world and being forced to respond to the systemic racism in society, Malcolm had to pretend to be something and someone he was not until he came to understand that he needed to fight that pressure. Overall, Lee's Malcolm X is extraordinarily effective in bringing The Autobiography of Malcolm X to life for viewers.

The younger actors are well cast too such as Brian Dennehy, Steve Guttenberg, Tahnee Welch (who is a better actress than her more famous mother Raquel) and Barret Oliver.The film has an excellent script and explores its timeless themes very well. You certainly don't have to be the characters' age to appreciate the film or even relate to all of their experiences. Ron Howard, one of the best directors of his generation, does a sterling job with the material. Not many films then or now focus their attention almost entirely on characters (particularly ordinary ones) in their 70s but it was a gamble that paid off. These days, I don't think that Hollywood would be willing to take the risk.Only 50 when the film was made, Brimley was decades younger than most of the film's other stars but he looked older than he was. By way of comparison, he was 27 years younger than Gilford and less than 11 years older than Linda Harrison (of Planet of the Apes fame, who it was nice to finally hear say more than one word!) who played his daughter in the film. He may have played an elderly man but he is seven years younger than Roger Moore, who played James Bond for the last time in A View to a Kill which was released at much the same time! One thing that I loved particularly loved about the film was that the elderly people act like real people. Most of them are just as confused and apprehensive about life as far younger people are. Often in films and TV, elderly characters are either on life support or have no personality outside of the fact that they're old. In this film, they're all individuals and behave as such. Art Selwyn - played by the simply wonderful Don Ameche - is my favourite character. He is basically a well-meaning cad (for want of a better description), an older version of the kind of character that Ameche often played in the 1930s and 1940s.I've always thought that 1985 was the best year for kids, teen and family films and this is my favourite of all the ones that I've seen with the exception of Back to the Future.

We all expect Italians in movies to be passionate, but we have never seen anything like this. Gennarino is a deckhand and a communist, whom she treats like dirt.When Raffaella and Gennarino get stranded on a deserted island, he decides to reverse roles with a vengeance. He beats her into submission, forcing her to call him Signor Carunchio, while calling her Raffaella (when not calling her a bitch or an industrial whore), instead of Signora Lanzetti, as he did on board the yacht. Then, when all this verbal and physical abuse has finally made her want him to ravish her brutally, he says that is not enough. She must tell him she loves him, kiss his feet, and worship him like a god. She actually does kiss his feet and submit to him totally, falling madly in love with him. But he still beats her whenever she misbehaves, as when she presumes to think instead of doing what she is told.This may be a minor point, but it is odd that Gennarino, the communist, believes that women should be totally subservient to men, which we would be more likely to associate with fascism.Anyway, the day finally arrives when a boat comes within sight of the island. Raffaella does not want to signal them because she fears being rescued might spoil their happiness. But Gennarino believes that only if they are rescued can he be sure that she truly loves him. Once rescued, Raffaella might have been able to thwart public opinion and marry Gennarino, but when she sees him being greeted by his wife, who talks about their children, she has misgivings. But given Gennarino's attitude toward women, why should he care about what happens to his wife? He wants Raffaella to go back and live on the island with him, but she decides against it. He reverts to calling her a bitch and an industrial whore.Because this is a comedy, we hesitate to take it too seriously, but there simply is not enough humor in this movie to overcome the revulsion we feel at the way he treats her, especially since the movie seems to prove he is right in believing that a man can make a woman love him by degrading her and beating her.

The movie is OK, not great, but definitely watchable. The plot is a little too predictable in my opinion. Maybe it wasn't 30 years ago. This is yet another story about how a young man is pretty much willing to sell his soul to make it to the top of the financial world Wall Street. And he does so by joining forces with the most ruthless of investors Michael Douglas. A man whose only pleasure comes from making money without any regards for anything or anyone. The predictable twist comes when the two characters are about to close a multi billion airline deal. It they go ahead with their plan, great wealth awaits both of them, but the young broker's father and thousands of other co-workers lose their jobs in the process. The young broker faces the ultimate dilemma to become what he had always wished for or to save his father by relinquishing his dreams. But if he does the latter, he takes down his partner...Not telling you the end, otherwise there's nothing left to watch.I'll just finish by saying that its a good enough movie (and I am extremely fussy) to watch on a Sunday afternoon, while you check your whatsapp and your facebook feed.

As we see in Superstar, some of these outsiders, like Mary Katherine Gallagher (played by Molly Shannon) and Helen Lewengrub (played by Emmy Laybourne), have a heart of gold.Yes, some of the things Mary Katherine does and says are funny, but it is not the main show nor the main point She wants to prove to herself and others that she is worthy of respect and love. She knows how good she is. When she realizes that she is seeking fame for other's approval, however, she rights her motivation, and continues on to a stellar performance at the talent show.This spiritual instruction by her grandmother, played by Glynis Johns, deserves special mention, because her character, although handicapped and in a wheelchair, proves that she still has much to offer Mary Katherine and the world. Pay attention to this movie and listen to what it is telling you about finding your own heart and soul and defending it at all times and at all costs Dare to dream and to pursue those dreams. Also, make sure it is your dream and not someone else's.I would have done a couple things differently in Superstar, had I been directing Sorry, Bruce Any movie with spontaneous, choreographed dance scenes is all-the-worse for it. Why? It is impossible. It makes no sense. Where and when did the students in the cafeteria rehearse this number? It makes me want to puke more than Evian pukes.Also, Mary Katherine's act at the talent contest should not have been interrupted by the record getting pushed to 45rpm. That was just stupid, and it consumed the time that could have been devoted to Mary Katherine doing some more funny and entertaining stuff on stage. Will Ferrel's appearance as Jesus Christ was particularly cool and funny. Slater took it pretty calmly when confronted by the King of Kings, on the road out of town! Very funny.I enjoyed the character of Slater, and think Harland Williams did a great job playing this complex-yet-simple character. Especially touching was the scene when Mary Katherine told him she (still) wanted a kiss from Sky (Will Ferrell), and Slater, though hurt, politely told her good night, and left.An especially candid statement was made by Mary Katherine, to Slater, at the pool Sometimes, I just hate the way I am. Molly Shannon does a great job of lighting up when Slater told her she is beautiful. This movie is not a comedy, and anyone who has ever been isolated, insulted or made to feel sub-par by a group will recognize this fact.If you are one of the drones who make others feel bad to make yourself feel good, you will despise this movie. Please think twice about the psychological effect you have on others.There are not many movies I can think of that I consider important.

Rafe comes back, none too happy that this union has taken place and Oh by the way the Japanese suddenly attack Pearl Harbor.Danny and Rafe put their differences aside and join Jimmy Doolittle's air corps that is going to launch a retaliatory strike on the Japanese.

Two years before this, he succeeded in the horror genre by creating the movie that still makes people afraid to go into the water Jaws. Close Encounters was his attempt at sci-fi, and boy! Did it work! I have seen this numerous times, each time getting better than the last. The first watch, I found the UFO parts cool but the rest dull. After every other watch, each aspect suddenly became better and not dull at all. Eventually, the dull parts became almost as good as the UFO parts earlier and the UFO parts became even greater than ever before. Roy Neary (Dreyfuss) is a power technician in Indiana who attempts to fix a power outage but sees spaceships that nearly blinds him. Similar incidents occur to others around the world. They become obsessed with a five-note musical number and a mountain. Roy's obsessions put his relationship with his family in jeopardy. Roy's and the others experience a close encounter with the first kind. Roy's obsessions practically turn him into a nutcase, which Dreyfuss plays very well. It may well be his best role. The toll it takes on his family is well-played too as his wife (Garr) and kids also do fine jobs of acting. Everybody else's bits are good too, including a three- year-old boy who wonders off to catch the UFOs and is trying to be protecting by his mother (Dillon). Meanwhile government agents investigate odd physical evidence of aliens and a missing ship that reappeared. That is the close encounter of the second kind. This part is what I found to be the most boring, as I don't like government or politics. But their alien investigations are quite interesting when you pay attention. Eventually, the spaceships land and mankind makes contact with actual aliens. That is the close encounter of the third kind. I loved when the spaceship lands and the aliens come out. As the best part in the movie, it is very lengthly. But the music and spaceships are so nice, you almost don't want it to end. The spaceships are the loveliest UFOs in film history. And the aliens coming out are just as nice. It is like candy for your eyes when you are the most starved. If you find the beginning boring, the ending will not disappoint. Like a regular Spielberg flick, he starts off slow then builds up as the minutes roll. After a few watches, you may agree with me when I say this is the best UFO movie ever and one of the ten best sci-fi flicks of all time.

Two years before this, he succeeded in the horror genre by creating the movie that still makes people afraid to go into the water Jaws. Close Encounters was his attempt at sci-fi, and boy! Did it work! I have seen this numerous times, each time getting better than the last. The first watch, I found the UFO parts cool but the rest dull. After every other watch, each aspect suddenly became better and not dull at all. Eventually, the dull parts became almost as good as the UFO parts earlier and the UFO parts became even greater than ever before. Roy Neary (Dreyfuss) is a power technician in Indiana who attempts to fix a power outage but sees spaceships that nearly blinds him. Similar incidents occur to others around the world. They become obsessed with a five-note musical number and a mountain. Roy's obsessions put his relationship with his family in jeopardy. Roy's and the others experience a close encounter with the first kind. Roy's obsessions practically turn him into a nutcase, which Dreyfuss plays very well. It may well be his best role. The toll it takes on his family is well-played too as his wife (Garr) and kids also do fine jobs of acting.

It's the twisted, deeply psychological tale of a corporate desk jockey whose world is turned upside down by a chance encounter. It's a movie about breaking free from your boring, conformist existence. And it's an eye opening examination of modern consumerist society- wrapped in layers of shocking violence, oddball humor, and dream scenes and hallucinations reminiscent of Dali. It's weird. It's not for children or the faint of heart. And it will blow your mind.Edward Norton's unnamed protagonist is an insomniac. For months the only way he's been able to get a good night's sleep is by going to support groups for problems he doesn't have. The emotional release he experiences with people worse off than himself allows him to loosen up, forget his troubles, and overlook the fact that he's a shameless faker. But things become even weirder when he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) an anti-conformist rebel and self styled 'urban guerrilla.' Thrown together by literally explosive circumstances, the pair discovers a release from the pressures and monotony of modern life in the form of no-holds-barred, one-on-one combat.Their idea catches on, and despite the number one rule of fight club being that you don't talk about fight club; their hobby rapidly grows into a secret society of like-minded nobodies. But as Tyler's nihilism and revolutionary fervor take hold, what was once a way to blow off steam becomes something much more sinister. And reality becomes blurred with fantasy as our unnamed hero finds himself in the center of a labyrinthine conspiracy of crime and destruction- one that everyone else seems to think he's behind.An important thing to understand about this movie is that none of the major characters are entirely sane. Not Tyler Durden, who splices individual frames of porn into family movies down at the local theater and makes soap using stolen by-products from the local liposuction clinic. Not the Norton character, who freely chooses to live in a decrepit, horrifyingly unsafe old house with the man I've just described and increasingly comes to confuse hostility and not giving a damn with enlightenment. And certainly not Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) the chain-smoking, habitually lying nympho who attends all the same support groups as the protagonist for equally fraudulent reasons, regularly threatens or attempts suicide, and begins having a passionate if somewhat confusing relationship with Durden.Another important thing to understand about Fight Club is that the movie itself is insane, in the best way possible. I'm talking Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction insane. Like a Tarantino film, Fight Club is unbelievably over the top, earning its R rating in every way possible. Again and again there are parts so shocking, so wrong, that you can't help but burst out laughing, and then wonder if you're as screwed up as the people on the screen. There are parts so bizarre that for a moment you're not sure that this is still the same movie. There are numerous seeming plot holes and bits that won't make sense until the end.And then there are the inherent contradictions within the whole premise of the movie. At its core, Fight Club is about internal development and self-discovery- which are achieved by beating other people senseless in the basement of a rundown liquor joint and blowing stuff up. Our guide on this journey of enlightenment is an antisocial, borderline psychotic narcissist who takes a view of mankind similar to Thomas Hobbes and whose main concern is sticking it to the man. Plus, as previous critics and websites like Cracked.com have pointed out, his plan to take down the man and stand up for the little guy would likely result in the deaths of dozens if not hundreds of blue collar night shift workers. And don't even get me started on the dynamics of a movie that attacks consumerism and obsession with material wealth raking in hundreds of millions of dollars.But none of this is a problem in the least. Fight Club isn't meant to be realistic or make perfect sense. The sheer absurdity of the situation is half the selling point, and any inconsistencies only add to its rich texture. This is pure escapism taken to &#x96;and beyond- its logical limits. When you get right down to it, Fight Club is the ultimate 'take this job and shove it fantasy. Tyler's brand of populist anarchy is sure to have a certain appeal to anyone who's ever felt bored with their life, been dissatisfied with their job, or run up way too many credit card bills. I suppose it's a good thing that this message comes from a criminal psychopath, or else someone might take it seriously.Bottom line, there are really no words to describe how ludicrous, hilarious, action packed, and truly awesome this movie is. It may be the greatest 'guy movie' ever made. It's certainly deeper and more complex than most movies with its levels of sex, violence, and language. This is the kind of movie that will still be regularly quoted and shown at midnight screenings decades from now. Assuming that you have a high tolerance for mature content, do yourself a favor and pick up a copy. Oh, and even if you already know the ending, go ahead and see it anyway. It will still be one of the most entertaining things you've seen in a long time.

It's been endlessly imitated and parodied, but never equaled. It made Clint Eastwood a household name. And yet, as I watch The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I can't help but feel a little sad knowing that what is perhaps the greatest of all westerns was made in Italy. Yes, this is one of the much-maligned spaghetti westerns, but it's as far above the average entry in its genre as Star Wars is to Starship Troopers, or A Hard Day's Night to Spiceworld.Surely we're all familiar with the basics of the story. The mysterious gunman Blondie (Eastwood), the rough hewn bandit Tuco (Eli Wallach), and the heartless killer Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) search the west for a hidden cache of gold, as the Civil War rages around them. There are countless twists, turns and betrayals, as each man realizes he can't do this on his own. You can't be sure of anything, except that before the adventure is over, there's going to be one hell of a showdown.Sergio Leone has done an exceptional job of writing and directing. There's not one line of unnecessary dialog, in fact there's no dialog at all for many long stretches. And not since High Noon has a movie been as successful at slowly building tension. Of course in High Noon, the entire movie was buildup, until the final shootout. Here, Leone gradually builds tension in a scene, and then provides a stylistically violent payoff again and again.Nowhere does he do it better than in the final standoff, where each of the three leading characters have a gun trained on one of the others. They each know that whoever wins here will walk away one of the richest men in the west, but they're also aware that pulling the trigger has a very good chance of getting both them and their target killed. And yet, if two of them where to ally themselves against the third&#x85;. We in the audience are also fully aware of these facts, but the movie gives us no clue as to who will come out the loser. Leone has also produced something that is a true feast for the senses. Through use of long unbroken shots, he shows the vastness, solitude, and desolate beauty of the west. Mesas, canyon lands, endless sand dunes, and scrub forest are all lavishly photographed, as the wind whistles and dust flies on the breeze. His sunrises and sunsets are works of art. Looking at this movie, it's easy to forget that it was filmed in Europe. Leone has also added quirky touches, like the legless veteran who hangs out at the local saloon, quite literally dragging himself up to the counter, or the Union colonel obsessed with destroying the bridge he's supposed to guard, so there won't be anything fighting over and he can go home. Of course it's not just the director who's responsible a movie's success or failure. The actors matter as well, and much credit is due the leading men for their brilliant performances. Clint Eastwood has long been one of my favorite actors, and this is by far one of his best pieces of acting. As Blondie, he's as tough as nails, utterly cool under fire, and one of the most mysterious figures since Jeff Costello. There's little of his past; he's in a rather unique partnership with Tuco at the film's beginning, and there's a history with Angel Eyes, but we get no idea where he's from, or what life he led before becoming an outlaw. He doesn't talk much either, preferring to puff on his cigarette. But he clearly follows some form of personal code, and there's no doubt that he's one of- if not the- best gunmen in the west.Cleef's Angel Eyes is much more straightforward; he's the very embodiment of evil. This man has no qualms about killing. Indeed, he seems to relish causing death and suffering for its own sake, as when he smothers an elderly employer to death with a pillow, or carries out his iron-fisted rule of a Union prison camp. His every word drips with menace, and his smile is like gazing up death itself.But the most interesting character just might be Eli Wallach's Tuco. He's got a rap sheet a mile long, and he goes to great lengths to carry out his revenge on Blondie, but he doesn't have the same aura of menace as Angel Eyes. He lies, cheats, steals, and sometimes kills, but not so much because he's evil as because he has no concept of morality. He's also funniest guy on the screen. In one scene he's all sweet talk, your best pal; not that he's believable for a second. The next minute he's launching a hilarious obscenity-laced rant against you and your family. Tuco's reunion with his brother- a priest! - is one of the best comedy scenes in any western. There are other comedic touches as well, like the legless veteran who hangs around the saloons, walking on his arms, or the Union commander bent on destroying the bridge he's tasked with protecting so that the fighting will end.It's also refreshing how few clichés there are. There's no extraneous love interest, no Indian attacks or stampedes, and you never hear anyone shouting about gathering up a posse. There is talking killer, but he's only a bit player, and Tuco lectures him on why you shouldn't talk when you can shoot- after shooting him, of courseBetween the acting, the action, the characters, the production values, and the originality, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is an achievement to rival the best of John Ford. Any fan of westerns, and anyone who enjoys good film should watch this one. It is truly one of the great movies.

His every word drips with menace, and his smile is like gazing up death itself.But the most interesting character just might be Eli Wallach's Tuco. He's got a rap sheet a mile long, and he goes to great lengths to carry out his revenge on Blondie, but he doesn't have the same aura of menace as Angel Eyes. He lies, cheats, steals, and sometimes kills, but not so much because he's evil as because he has no concept of morality. He's also funniest guy on the screen. In one scene he's all sweet talk, your best pal; not that he's believable for a second. The next minute he's launching a hilarious obscenity-laced rant against you and your family. Tuco's reunion with his brother- a priest! - is one of the best comedy scenes in any western. There are other comedic touches as well, like the legless veteran who hangs around the saloons, walking on his arms, or the Union commander bent on destroying the bridge he's tasked with protecting so that the fighting will end.It's also refreshing how few clichés there are. There's no extraneous love interest, no Indian attacks or stampedes, and you never hear anyone shouting about gathering up a posse. There is talking killer, but he's only a bit player, and Tuco lectures him on why you shouldn't talk when you can shoot- after shooting him, of courseBetween the acting, the action, the characters, the production values, and the originality, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is an achievement to rival the best of John Ford. Any fan of westerns, and anyone who enjoys good film should watch this one. It is truly one of the great movies. ","genre":"Western"},{"date":"7 December 2014","score":"","review":" Malcolm X was a fantastic movie that should have won an Oscar, if not for best movie than for Denzel Washington's performance as Malcolm X. Spikes Lee's style pairs beautifully with the complex topic surrounding Malcolm X. Spike Lee portrays the beginning of Malcolm's life through a rose colored lens. Lee shoots Malcolm's young days as a hustler in a softer, foggier lens than the rest of the movie. The way it is filmed sets an almost light hearted and ignorant tone for the start of the film. After Malcolm gets placed in jail, the way the movie is filmed changes. Spike Lee now displays the film through sharp images. This gives the movie a more serious feel and present Malcolm's new perspective of life in a very direct way. In the scene with the dictionary, Spike Lee uses camera movement to highlight the significant words in the definitions on the page. The camera jumps from word to word on the pages of the dictionary, focusing on important words such as black and evil. It helps us understand Malcolm's agitation as he discovers that white people have been defining black as a bad and devilish thing for hundreds of years.The Autobiography of Malcolm X which was written by Alex Haley was a very unemotional book. It seemed to tell the story of Malcolm's life in a list format. The movie on the other hand was very emotional. There were many scenes that didn't even need the sound placed in it, to convey the emotion in it. One scene is when Malcolm and his wife Betty are preparing for their wedding. Spike places them very close to each other and sets the camera close to them to give the scene an intimate feel. He films it from a side profile view allowing the actors to interact face to face without the camera feeling like it is intervening. This emotion is what makes this movie outstanding instead of just a good movie. I highly recommend it for anyone who is trying to understand who Malcolm was and why he and his followers acted as they did. It can really change someone's perspective on life and displays some of the problems in society that have yet to be solved.

Martin has undoubtedly created THE dumbest character ever to appear in a movie. As Navin R. Johnson, he is dense enough to not realize that he's adopted- even though his whole family is black! He's the kind of guy who will gladly accept a ride to the end of the fence, and considers making $1.10 an hour as a gas station attendant to be a dream come true. He's too stupid to understand that a girl who will tattoo your name on her butt after the first date isn't exactly a high class woman.OK. So he's dumb. So dumb in fact that he could never exist in real life. Anyone who takes the actions he takes, and goes through the experiences that he goes through, can only be a fictional construct. Usually this is fatal for a movie, because audiences cannot suspend their disbelief. This is especially true when the film has no real plot, but is merely a series a series of loosely connected scenes, as this movie is. Such are the trademarks of a box office bomb.But here, with Martin in lead, it works. The Jerk is so over the top, and Martin plays dumb so successfully, that it's hilarious, believable or not. The entire film is on the level of a middle school production, and it's something of a one joke movie, but it's just plain funny from beginning to end.I love his movie, and I laughed every minute, but I'm at something of a loss to explain its success. I guess if you play dumb enough, there's no telling what you can accomplish.
