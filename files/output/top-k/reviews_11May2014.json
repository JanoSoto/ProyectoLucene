Where do I even begin to review a film like Pulp Fiction. Let me just start out by saying that I have never seen another film like Pulp Fiction. This was my first Quentin Tarantino film, and in my opinion none of his other films have even come close to this masterpiece. One of the greatest things about this film, and also something that sets it apart from most any other movie, is that it revolves around the dialogue. The conversations between characters in Pulp Fiction are unlike any conversations between characters that I have ever seen in a film, because they are absurdly realistic. This film is the most quotable movie I have ever seen, to the point where the last scene of the film I know almost every line. Usually if a film tries to revolve around the dialogue, it ends up being really boring. This is because not many directors can do dialogue the way that Quentin Tarantino does dialogue.The acting in this movie is also incredible. This is my favorite role that Samuel L. Jackson has played (Jules Winnfield) and also my favorite role of John Travolta's (Vincent Vega), as well as my favorite role of Uma Thurman (Mia Wallace) and Tim Roth (Ringo). There is not one weak performance in Pulp Fiction. Tarantino's non-linear, non-story based masterpiece is the most unique film that I have ever seen. It is entirely left up to your own interpretation. Nothing in this film is explained for you. You are free to think of it however you want, and make up your own stories. Once you see the film you will no doubt be left with questions such as What is in the briefcase, one of the longest standing questions asked of a film. People try to come up with the answer, but the truth is that there is no answer. The answer is whatever you want it to be. Never before have I seen a film that leaves so much up to the viewer's interpretation, and does it so well. If you do not see this movie, you are missing out on one of the best movies ever made, and possibly the most unique film that you will ever see. This Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece by far.Pulp Fiction obviously gets a 10 out of 10.

While letting Hannibal cramp our comfort, like getting to close for comfort in a few scenes from his predecessor, here he is uncaged, let loose, where we really learn what this brilliant psychopath is capable of, violence wise, and here it's a fear that runs much deeper than Silence Of The Lambs, and we got the violence factor to show for it. How they even gave Hannibal an MA rating in the first place, escapes me. Seriously the censor board ought to be shot. The scenes involving heavy face disfigurement, body mutilations, disembowellments, flying intestines, whatever, plus the infamous brain scene near it's finale, warrants real strong stomach stuff, the higher bar of violence which has been set here, almost coming off as stylistic, suiting the whole air of the film. Check out the cover for starters. A poster design couldn't of been more better suited. The Silence Of The Lambs, was scary, but Hannibal is bloody terrifying, and that I got that air, prefore to going into to see this with my dad. I knew what I was letting myself in for, and like a great tasting dish, I was very much if scarily appeased, if not daring to ask for more. Julianne Moore, who I think is a great actress, can't really replace Clarice Starling, but she still does one hell of a job. She's just not as good, although I liked Moore's interpretation. Oldman who sets acting standards so high, is fantastic as usual, as a rich, perverted slug, Mason Verger who got what he deserved. He's sent a contract out to kill Hannibal, responsible for his grotesque, facial deformity, while getting sozzled one night with the cannibalistic maniac. Oldman's character is repellent. He's into little boys, one scene involving pigs sickened me. An incapacitated Verger, so filled with revenge, enlists Moore to track him down, where of course, nastier plans are set for her. She clashes with an old FBI nemesis, Paul Krendler (a solid Liotta) after an unrelated sting operation goes horribly wrong, and the young wanted assailant dies, clutching her surviving infant in her arms. Liotta's sour history with her had him trying to crack onto her, but remember, our hot shot Clarice, doesn't get involved. Krendler's nastier true colors come to surface later on, where Hannibal is there to right those wrongs, especially at dinner. Notably the brain scene look shockingly awesome and inappropriate to the viewer as a special din din has been prepared by Hannibal for him and his other much specialer guest. We have a sub plot with French cop who makes Hannibal, and with a big reward on offer, sometimes the price of knowledge can be fatal. I loved how this sequel has come, it maintains a high level of terror and suspense, throughout, not like the remade prequel, Red Dragon, which was to follow, a later, unwarranted. You really know you're about to go in, if unconsciously apprehensive of it, to see some something that will really make those hairs on your wrist stand, or get that heart pumping, and on the big screen, that is exactly what you get, proving, Ridley Scott, like his late brother Tony, god rest his soul, are only capable of making hits. As for Hopkins, he was much more scary, caged, behind those bars, those ten years back, with those beady eyes, drilling into yours. He hasn't lost that menace, but like I said, he's scary because we know what he's capable of, and here he's about to really show us how much.

And as long as we can focus on that first glance, the film provides compelling entertainment. I found myself caught up in the movie. Director Ron Howard (Splash, Parenthood) delivers an intriguing story about a man struggling to maintain clarity as his prodigious powers of imagination bring him inspiration, delusion, true love, and trouble. How rare is this? A film out of Hollywood in which the hero's most heroic endeavour involves restraint and self control! But A Beautiful Mind presents itself as the true story of John Nash, whose mathematical breakthroughs have apparently changed the world. And there's the rub. I came away from A Beautiful Mind feeling inspired to learn more about this fascinating character. And the farther I moved from the movie, the more I began to see it for what it is a fantasy, at best&#x85; and at worst, a rip-off game by con-artist. Strong accusations? I suppose so. And for the record, I don't expect films that are based on a true story to be 100% factual. It's impossible to tell a story that is entirely true to its inspiration; we all invent fictions in order to convey aspects of the truth that are most important to us. But shouldn't movies that claim to be based on actual events seek to bear some resemblance to those actual events? Is it too much to ask that the film makers and storytellers be reasonable in their embellishments? Watching this film, we endure the hardship of John Nash's mental problems right alongside him. Howard, who has proved time and time again that he can build a decent, workmanlike motion picture does his typically adequate job of telling the story. And the great Russell Crowe brings a lot to the production. Crowe, who deserved an Oscar for his work in The Insider (but received one for Gladiator instead, alas!) is fantastic. He transforms himself into this staggering, bewildered, tormented soul. In spite of a bland script, he gives us glimpses of a hurting spirit, an alienated boy, incapable of discerning the difference between fantasy and reality. It's hard to watch. As we watch Nash grow old, Crowe's performance and make up (some of the finest ageing make up I have ever seen) deliver a completely convincing human being burdened with challenges most of us have never imagined. Nash is a character who isn't comfortable with what we consider normal life. In social circles, he's brusque and rude. Around women, he's awkward and downright insulting. At work, he ridicules the great ideas of his genius peers, calling their work derivative and declaring, There's not an original or innovative idea in any of it. Nash's troubles stem from schizophrenic hallucinations, and A Beautiful Mind is the story of his struggle to reject false realities and hold fast to what is true. But he is calm, collected, and right at home whenever he's breaking codes and solving mathematical problems. We can see the potential in him, and so, in spite of his unkindness, we find Nash sympathetic.

And as long as we can focus on that first glance, the film provides compelling entertainment. I found myself caught up in the movie. Director Ron Howard (Splash, Parenthood) delivers an intriguing story about a man struggling to maintain clarity as his prodigious powers of imagination bring him inspiration, delusion, true love, and trouble. How rare is this? A film out of Hollywood in which the hero's most heroic endeavour involves restraint and self control! But A Beautiful Mind presents itself as the true story of John Nash, whose mathematical breakthroughs have apparently changed the world. And there's the rub. I came away from A Beautiful Mind feeling inspired to learn more about this fascinating character. And the farther I moved from the movie, the more I began to see it for what it is a fantasy, at best&#x85; and at worst, a rip-off game by con-artist. Strong accusations? I suppose so. And for the record, I don't expect films that are based on a true story to be 100% factual. It's impossible to tell a story that is entirely true to its inspiration; we all invent fictions in order to convey aspects of the truth that are most important to us. But shouldn't movies that claim to be based on actual events seek to bear some resemblance to those actual events? Is it too much to ask that the film makers and storytellers be reasonable in their embellishments? Watching this film, we endure the hardship of John Nash's mental problems right alongside him. Howard, who has proved time and time again that he can build a decent, workmanlike motion picture does his typically adequate job of telling the story. And the great Russell Crowe brings a lot to the production. Crowe, who deserved an Oscar for his work in The Insider (but received one for Gladiator instead, alas!) is fantastic. He transforms himself into this staggering, bewildered, tormented soul. In spite of a bland script, he gives us glimpses of a hurting spirit, an alienated boy, incapable of discerning the difference between fantasy and reality. It's hard to watch. As we watch Nash grow old, Crowe's performance and make up (some of the finest ageing make up I have ever seen) deliver a completely convincing human being burdened with challenges most of us have never imagined. Nash is a character who isn't comfortable with what we consider normal life. In social circles, he's brusque and rude. Around women, he's awkward and downright insulting. At work, he ridicules the great ideas of his genius peers, calling their work derivative and declaring, There's not an original or innovative idea in any of it. Nash's troubles stem from schizophrenic hallucinations, and A Beautiful Mind is the story of his struggle to reject false realities and hold fast to what is true. But he is calm, collected, and right at home whenever he's breaking codes and solving mathematical problems. We can see the potential in him, and so, in spite of his unkindness, we find Nash sympathetic. We root for him when he is drawn into working for a harsh and manipulative government operative (Ed Harris.)

Through a lot of troubles they eventually succeed in finding gold, but greedy outlaws (Alfonso Bedoya) , and most especially craziness lead to disaster . As they sold their souls for the treasure of the Sierra Madre . It's an intelligent semi-western that scrutinizes the greed and paranoia that afflicts a misfit group , including their enormous difficulties and breathtaking taking on between protagonists and the Mexican enemies that stalk to them . The film blends thrills , emotion , intrigue , high body-count and it's fast moving and exciting ; being filmed in Mexico, though Warners' studio head Jack L. Warner had the unit return to Hollywood when the budget started to exceed $3 million . Thought-provoking screenplay by the same Huston , concerning about greed and ambition that threaten to turn their success into disaster . Director John Huston had read the book by B. Traven in 1936 and had always thought the material would make a great movie . Based on a 19th-century ballad by a German poet , Traven's book reminded Huston of his own adventures in the Mexican cavalry . When Huston became a director at Warner Bros. , the smashing success of his initial effort, The Maltese Falcon (1941), gave him the clout to ask to write and direct the project, for which Warner Bros had previously secured the movie rights . Although by many to be director John Huston's finest film , this is a tale of fear , greed and murder , as three partners fall out over the gold they have clawed out of the inhospitable and bandit-ridden deserts and mountains . It also has probably the most brutal gold bar fight ever put on film along with The Ruthless Four . Overrated by some reviewers , but very interesting and attractive to watch . It above all things mostly also remains a real characters movie, in which the three main roles are the essentials . Their dynamic together is also great and is what mostly keeps this movie going . They are three totally different characters, which is the foremost reason why they work out so great together on film . Bogart is superbly believable and gives a nice portrait of an increasingly unhinged prospector , Walter Huston is very good as a cunning veteran and Tim Holt is also pretty well . John Huston has a cameo as an American tourist , this scene was directed by Humphrey Bogart, who took malicious pleasure on his director by making him perform the scene over and over again.

The crew of the spaceship come into contact with an alien lifeform, and must fight to survive, as well as save the human race. The feel of the movie and characters is very authentic, which, (along with the excellent story), is why I love it so much. It is basically a science fiction thriller, with a very on-the-edge-of-your'seat feel to it.

The movie is reportedly based on Tarkovsky's own life. Basically we have a collection of vignettes (though in the film they are not shown chronologically). We have the protagonist as a boy (he is presumably based on Tarkovsky) living in a house with his mother (Margarita Terekhova in an intense performance) in the countryside before World War II, we see him later as a teenager training shooting with a rifle (with a stern instructor) presumably during the war, we see the absent father returning after World War II in soldier's uniform, we see the mother having a bad day in her job as proofreader in a printing house (that was actually Tarkovsky's mother real job), we see after the war how the boy has become a man (though he is never shown as an adult) and how he argues with his former wife (played also by Terekhova) about how to raise their troubled son called Ignat, we see a female doctor use hypnosis to try to cure Ignat's stuttering. Intercalated with these vignettes, we have documentary footage of the Spanish Civil War, of World War II, China's Cultural Revolution, the Chinese-Soviet border clashes during the late 1960. We also have surreal scenes of the mother levitating in the house, we have the child walking in the wintry countryside in a recreation of Brueghel's painting The Hunters in the Snow, we have the boy slowly perusing an art book. All to the music of Bach and Purcell and to poetry recitation by Tarkovksy's father Arseni.

However, it quickly fades into 'Really?' for me, from the parents being able to hear their daughters moans when the phone is held in an outstretched arm, to the rest of the entire film being completely slapstick and silly.For those who call this move original, it DOES do something most horror movies try to NOT do, which is be fairly fake, flat, and uninteresting. I guess not having watched this in my teen years but really WANTING to have watched it when my older sister saw it with her friends, this movie was hyped up to me, with mental images of red filtered scenes of people falling to their deaths, screaming as they did so, to a much more artful process (must like Kill Bill, actually) than this was.It is mildly entertaining, but not what I generally look for with a movie that is SUPPOSED to be scary.
