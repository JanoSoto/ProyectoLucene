After numerous attempts to get her songs heard she accepts a job at a bar baring the title name. The owner explains the rules then she is off tap dancing on bar tops. She eventually meets someone who is interested in helping her get established with song writing but intelligent viewers will realize that it is just an excuse for a dull romance. Dreary setup with predictable circumstances and behavior that is applauded that shouldn't be. David McNally does his best as director but even the locations spark little enthusiasm. Piper Perabo is the one casting that elevates above the low level material. She dreams big and works the bar to get there financially but much of this is predictable. Maria Bello as her boss is a total stereotype. Adam Garcia as her love interest is a useless prop for predictable romantic drivel. John Goodman as her father never rises above the humour level.

All of those elements make The Running Man a fantastic SCI-FI-Action-Thriller that is Arnold Schwarzenegger at his best.Based on the novel by Stephen King(writing under the name Richard Bachman)and set in the future in 2019,The Running Man tells the story of Ben Richards(Arnold Schwarzenegger),a former cop who was framed for killing dozens of people and sent to prison but later escapes. While on the run from the law Richards is captured by the police and is put on the television show The Running Man which is hosted by Damon Killian(Richard Dawson)and is a show where he's being chased by stalkers. Now on the show as a contestant,Richards must now have to figure out how to clear his name and stay alive.The Running Man is a wonderful and Action-packed SCI-FI-Action-Thriller that was a modest success at the Box Office but the movie seems to get lost in the shuffle with other Arnold Schwarzenegger movies as the movie came out in between Action classics such as The Terminator and Terminator 2Judgment Day,Predator,Total Recall and Commando,but I have always loved The Running Man as one of my favorite Arnold Schwarzenegger movies and in my opinion it's one of his better films. From beginning to end The Running Man is just pure and delightful entertainment that is thrilling and over the top and is one of those movies where when the Action starts it keeps going and never quits. When you mix together Action,Dystopian SCI-FI,Satirical Humor and cheesy but very memorable puns and one liners you have a great movie in my opinion. The Action is amazing and thrilling because we get gunfights,explosions and many other exciting things going on throughout the movie that will keep viewers entertained and on the edge of their seats. The Satirical Humor of the movie works so well because the movie is mocking game shows,television and the media where everything is outlandish and turned on it's head. Ben Richards is a terrific character in the typical Arnold Schwarzenegger moldhe's very tough,confident and can handle himself against all odds while spitting out one-liners and kicking butt at the same time. When he's in The Running Man game he faces off with the stalkers well using his strength and brains to outsmart the stalkers and we the audience root for him to survive. Damian Killain is the opposite because as soon as we see him we hate his guts because as the host of The Running Man all he cares about is television ratings no matter who lives or dies. And while he doesn't kill anyone he's probably the most vicious character in the movie and you want to see Killian go down. I love movies that are set in a dark Dystopian future and The Running Man has always been one of my favorites movies set in a dark future because in The Running Man the United States in the future is a police state where schools are shut down,freedom is nonexistent and the media tells you what they want you to hear and where the economy and society have truly fallen apart. Even though the film is silly and over the top The Running Man is pretty relevant as the movie gave viewers a foreshadow to what would be known as reality television but in the world of The Running Man reality television is taken to such a violent extreme where the game is death and the prize is life. The themes and issues addressed in The Running Man make the movie rise above the typical Action movie and give the film some substance. Some Stephen King fans will be disappointed that the movie isn't really faithful to the original book but as a Stephen King fan myself I can see the movie and book as two different but great things that both can be enjoyed. The ending of The Running Man is amazing,fun and filled with Action and surprises that truly hits the spot. An outstanding ending.The cast is great. Arnold Schwarzenegger is excellent and at his best as Ben Richards,with Schwarzenegger,being charismatic,kicking butt and saying great one-liners. Richard Dawson is fantastic as Damon Killain,the sadistic game show host of The Running Man. Maria Conchita Alozno is terrific,beautiful and sexy as Amber,a woman who helps Ben. Yaphet Kotto and Marvin J. Mcintyre are great as Laughlin and Weiss,two members of a resistance. Mick Fleetwood gives a fine performance as Mic,the leader of the resistance. Jesse Ventura(Captain Freedom),Jim Brown(Fireball),Gus Rethwisch(Buzzsaw),Erland Van Lidth De Jeude(Dynamo)and Toru Tanaka(Subzero)are fun and menacing as The Running Man stalkers. Dweezil Zappa(Stevie),Kurt Fuller(Tony)and Sven-Ole Thorsen(Sven)give good performances as well.The direction by Paul Michael Glaser(of Starsky & Hutch fame)is wonderful,with Glaser always moving the camera and bringing an energy,style and pace to the film. Fine direction,Glaser.The score by Harold Faltermeyer is great,memorable and matches the tone and energy of the movie. Amazing score,Faltermeyer. There is also the memorable song called Restless Heart(Running Away With You)by John Parr.In Final Word,if you love Arnold Schwarzenegger,SCI-FI films or Action-Thrillers,I highly suggest you see The Running Man,a terrific and entertaining SCI-FI\/Action\/Thriller that is Arnold Schwarzenegger at his best.

The concept here is interesting and the idea of TV Actors being plunged into real life roles that they merely act out on TV certainly packs lots of potential, but unfortunately I very rarely laughed throughout the entirety of this film.I liked some of the social commentary at the start with regard to actors living on past glories... I also liked the idea that some actors hate this aspect of their lives and other relish it. I imagine this idea is probably more true than we would care to admit. Again though, it provides us with very few laughs and many of the 'Galaxy Quest' fans were really annoying and the same can be said for a lot of the dialogue here. There are some mildly amusing moments such as some of the geeks taking 'Galaxy Quest' way too seriously and asking the actors questions that they can't possibly answer. Again it's believable and again would have been great if any of it was actually funny.Even when we get to the part where the TV Actors are forced to save the day and become the real life heroes of characters that they portray the film never really shifts up a gear. The dialogue is generally dull and clunky, the Alien characters are annoying (particularly the lead Alien - whoever's idea it was to get him to speak in that annoying voice wants slapping).The idea of the Aliens believing that the actors are real life space heroes again was a nice arc to the story, but again provided no real humour. In fact, all we got from this was a nice moral message about 'being truthful' - albeit it was perhaps delivered in a slightly 'heavy-handed' manner.

Far from things like Saving Private Ryan or Schindler's List or Munich, where Spielberg tries to shoehorn himself into the persona of the mature and serious filmmaker, Empire of the Sun is as close to his sensibilities as any material could ever hope to be. The telling of the horrors of World War 2 through the eyes of a child has never been done better. I guess if Miyazaki ever made a live action WW-II film, you'd get something similar to Empire of the Sun. Yep, that's Christian Bale there. Spielberg is well known for ferreting great child performances out of his young stars, but in this case, Christian Bale burns through the screen in his devastating portrayal of young Jim in what is probably the best performance by a child actor ever. During the course of the film, you see Jim going from his pampered existence as the son of a British diplomat in Shanghai through a harrowing physical and emotional transformation, as he loses his family, his home, his childhood and eventually his self. Ending up in a Japanese concentration camp where deprivation and death are on the daily agenda, the young protagonist finds himself desperately clinging to his last remnants of childhood innocence, his love for flight and airplanes or the British culture of a country he hasn't even seen in order to retain some semblance of sanity. I don't believe Bale ever topped this one in his later career.Right from the first scene, with the boats moving through a harbor crowded with coffins to the final one, with Jim's childhood in the form of a bag floating on the waters, this is classic Spielberg, along with the haunting and poignant Williams score. If there ever was a film to land him Oscar recognition, this should have been it. Despite its rather heavy themes, its is also highly re-watchable.

And when I say favorite I do not mean that in the way I can say The Goonies is one of my favorite films. No no no. I mean that I consider this, artistically, the finest movie I've seen so far - and I'm not a young man anymore. It has held this place for me for decades and even though I still secretly wish some new film will come along and sweep me off my feet the way Scissorhands did, I deem this more unlikely by the year.I have to admit, I didn't have much respect for Burton before watching Scissorhands. I was still young during his first films, and being a child through the 80's raised on Spielberg fare, I simply couldn't understand and appreciate Burton's dark vision in the first two Batmans (which I disliked back then). I still remember watching Scissorhands on T.V. for the first time and going through half the movie with a this ain't that bad, but it's not anything special either attitude until that Ice Dance sequence came along and then thinking what the hell just happened?. Theme is an important factor when determining a favorite film. No matter what the artistic quality of a movie, some themes are bound to resonate more with some specific audiences than others. As it happens, Scissorhands has essentially the best treatment of the theme that resonates most strongly with my tastes loneliness and being different in a hostile environment. Oh, this is so emo!, you will counter. But this is the same story behind Frankenstein. Or Oedipus Rex. Or Star Wars for that matter. Hell, there is hardly a story worth telling in literature or cinema that doesn't incorporate this element. The hero is the hero precisely because he is different from everybody else, otherwise he would be an extra in his own story. Some will hate him and some will love him for that and the entire point in storytelling is how the hero's differences eventually play out in the grander scheme of things. Burton chose to hit the nail right on the head and didn't hesitate from turning individuality, loneliness and the outsider into the central theme of this film. Right after his Batman success and being given essentially free reign to do whatever he wanted, Burton decided he would craft his most personal work. It isn't hard to see there was a lot of input from his own life going into the character of Edward, a man that is doomed to be both highly creative and highly destructive. Scissorhands is a work of love for Burton and it shows.Story-wise, this isn't but a retelling of Frankenstein. The inventor creates an artificial man but dies before finishing his work, leaving Edward incomplete and all alone. He eventually attempts a foray into the world outside, which reacts as expected in such situations, at first with curiosity, then with suspicion and eventually with persecution. By the end of the movie, the crowd is assembled, pitchforks and torches in hand to claim the monster's head. The moment Edward steps out of his castle on the hill, he becomes the author of his own tragedy. His creativity and talents draw people to him, while at the same time spread jealousy and hatred against him.Burton and his screenwriter Caroline Thomson manage to turn this story into a live action magic realism piece that doesn't shy away from comedy and manages adeptly its heavy material without going all doom and gloom on us. Many have tried to do magic realism on screen and failed miserably and Scissorhands is one of the few exceptions that does the genre justice. The story starts as a bed-time story, with the simple question why does it snow? and by the end of the film, under Danny Elfman's masterful score, you finally get your answer in a perfect cinematic circle the equal of Forrest Gump's feather sequence, or Twelve Monkeys. The main character is brought to life by a captivating Johny Depp, who gives at a very young age a performance that is one of the best of his illustrious career as the tormented protagonist, essentially a silent role, relying mostly on physicality and eye expression. A similarly young and radiant Winona Ryder accompanies him, along with a cast of well known stars like Dianne Wiest and Alan Arkin and even Vincent Price in his farewell performance as the inventor. Burton was at his creative peak at the time and his vision is fresh and uncompromising, from his Gothic character and set designs to the pal suburbia that hides more dangers than a castle ever could. His directorial prowess here is a sight to behold, with every sequence very thought out and immaculately executed. There are so many scenes in Scissorhands that stand out. The lyrical opening titles, the cookie factory sequence, the Ice Dance, the devastating finale. Or the moment of the inventor's death, where Edward's first touch with his creator only leaves a bleeding wound... perfection.There is so much talent involved in the making of this movie it is hard to find fault in any department. Collen Atwood would go on to win 3 Oscars and many nominations with her costume designs, Bo Welch is a Burton staple and Richard Halsey was the Oscar winning editor of Rocky. All of them give some of their career best in Scissorhands. The great Stan Winston created the scissor effects. And then there is Danny Elfman, who composed his best score ever to complement this dark masterpiece, arguably one of the best scores of the decade.

In Guffman, Guest's character, Corky, is the only has-been, and then only if you count '10 years living in New York and failing auditions' as achieving something in show business.

Consider Parker Posey's performance as Libby Mae Brown, the Dairy Queen worker. Posey tells you everything you need to know about the listless ennui of being stuck in a place with nothing to do and no way to grow with a couple of wordless moments where she looks away, her eyes reverberating what is not being said about the failure of dreams.

Director Irvin Winkler does an effective job at creating Bullock's sudden world of paranoia. Bullock basically runs and makes narrow escapes. She could have out paced most marathon runners with the amount of running she does, and it effects the depth of the role, which slowly disintegrates. Jeremy Northam is cardboard as the sly villain. He talks the talk and gets blasted in the face with a fire extinguisher. He should be thankful considering how dull his dialogue was sounding coming from his mouth. Dennis Miller plays Bullock's only trusted friend who lands in trouble just for helping her. Or perhaps he landed in hot water for agreeing to do the film. Diane Baker also appears for all the good it does her. It is well made but it is unfortunate that the screenplay settles for tired thriller formula as oppose to examine the reality of identity theft.

Score 4 \/ 10 ","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"19 August 2015","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" With most of the action set in one room and involving only two people, this tense psychological thriller is more like a stage-play than a movie. Fortunately, this style of presentation works well in establishing the claustrophobic atmosphere and sense of unease that prevails throughout this tale of an unfortunate man who, through no fault of his own, is held captive by a psychotic woman. The physical pain and mental torment that he suffers is dreadful and the journey that he makes through his personal nightmare is both harrowing and compelling to watch.Paul Sheldon (James Caan) is a highly successful writer whose numerous romantic novels featuring his heroine, Misery Chastain, have all been best-sellers. Having grown tired of writing this type of material, he'd recently been working on his first serious novel and on completing his manuscript, sets out from Silver Creek Lodge in Colorado and drives down a mountain road in a snowstorm to deliver his work to his agent. As the conditions worsen and the road becomes more slippery, he loses control of his car which rolls down a bank and into a snowdrift where he ends up unconscious with two broken legs, a dislocated shoulder and numerous other injuries.Local Woman Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) discovers the wreckage and pulls Paul out of the vehicle before taking him to her isolated home where she starts to nurse him back to health. When he regains consciousness, Paul is grateful for what Annie's done and soon learns that she's a trained nurse and a devoted fan who feels privileged to have him staying at her home. She tells him that because of the storm, the roads are closed and the telephones are out of action, so she's unable to inform anyone immediately of his whereabouts. Annie's obviously a lonely person and acts rather coyly and politely at this stage.After reading Paul's just-completed manuscript, she changes radically, becomes very angry and expresses her strong disgust at the amount of swearing it contains. A little later, when she also reads his newly-released Misery Chastain novel, she becomes outraged when she discovers that he's killed off her favourite character (Misery) and feels betrayed by him. She uses her dominance over him to make him burn his new manuscript and write a new novel in which Misery is brought back to life. As her behaviour continues to become increasingly violent and unhinged, Paul tries to go along with what she wants as far as possible whilst also trying to devise a way of escaping his hellish ordeal.Annie Wilkes is a highly eccentric character who's initially very ingratiating but later becomes completely deranged and horribly violent. With her pet pig (called Misery), her love of Liberace's recordings and an obsessive need to control Paul, the scope for any actress who portrays her is obviously enormous. Kathy Bates, in her Oscar-winning performance, does an amazing job of bringing this complex woman to life and James Caan, whose character is so helpless and physically constrained throughout, skilfully overcomes these limitations to make Paul a very sympathetic victim. Richard Farnsworth and Frances Sternhagen add some light relief as the local sheriff and his wife and Lauren Bacall is also excellent in her cameo role as Paul's agent.The way in which the action unfolds on-screen is vital to the success of this movie and director Rob Reiner's brilliant pacing plays a big part in building up the mood and tension so effectively. There are some shocking moments such as the shooting of one of the story's minor characters and the infamous sledgehammer scene but more surprisingly, maybe, there's also a certain amount of humour to enjoy.
