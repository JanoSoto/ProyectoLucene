The first 20 minutes or so of this film is increasingly graphic, but if you've ever wondered the true nature of a story told by a surviving veteran relative, here it is!The plot is part non-fiction and part fiction, focusing on a mother who wants her son brought home after his three remaining brothers are killed in battle.

James Ryan (played by Matt Damon, who does not overact in the role) behind enemy lines.  Each and every soldier was different, and what made it so interesting was how they interacted with one another. Yes, they were extremely sympathetic. The cinematography was brilliant, as was the set (which they actually filmed in international areas.)  Another memorable scene was their conversations in that broken down French town towards the finale (Cherbourg?) speaking of romances that occurred back home and the irony of that record player working, with a French lady singing about heartbreak.

Of course the movie's highest points are the brilliantly realistic war scenes, especially the Omaha Beach scene but the visuals aren't it's only good parts. The story is quite well thought out and the reactions from the charecters are very realistic, ie. The soldiers aren't too happy about having to risk their lives for one private who no one has even heard of. The charecters are very well developed and you really get to know and love (or hate) each and every one of their personalities individually. Speilberg got his point across so well that by the end you're screaming KILL SOME NAZIS, THEN KILL MORE NAZIS, THEN AFTER THAT KILL EVEN MORE NAZIS.
