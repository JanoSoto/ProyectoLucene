I am a big fan of the sleazy and sordid. My user name Dr Gore may tip you off to this fact. A thriller about underground porno is right up my sleaze alley. I knew that a mainstream flick starring Nicolas Cage wasn't going to be too harsh but I was ready to see what the filmmakers had up their sleeve.Joaquin Phoenix tells Nicolas Cage, There are things you're going to see that you can't unsee. After 8MM was over, I knew exactly what he meant. Why can't I get this lameness out of my head? The pain! The torture! 8MM is a wannabe shock movie. Unfortunately every step down the staircase to Porno Hell is lame and laughable. Every character is a cartoon figure. Nothing resides in any remote semblance of reality. I thought I was going to get the guided tour of Sicko-Porno land. Instead I got the Hollywood super shine, glossy version. Bleech.The spike through this movie's heart is the evil character known as The Machine. Cage has tracked down the Machine and dukes it out with him. The Machine decides to take this opportunity to give a long speech to Cage in order to protest the stereotyping of wackos in leather masks. This one scene exposes the filmmakers as complete frauds. No way, no how, would a depraved lunatic take a break from his beating to give a monologue on his evil ways. 8MM is a waste of time. It was made by fools who have absolutely no idea what they are talking about. 3\/10.

Jason wants to go check out the sights and grind up a few more teens along the way.Friday the 13th Part VIII is easily the worst one in the series. What makes a good Jason movie versus a bad one? Three things BLOOD, BLOOD and BLOOOOOOD! The blood spray was lacking in this one. Jason was a very tired mass murderer. He looked like he'd rather hang by the pool than have to kill these dang teens. Work, work, work. Also, this entry promises you Manhattan but most of the movie is spent running around the ship. NYC only figures into the last twenty minutes or so. The ending in the sewer is also completely ridiculous.In a nutshell, it stinks.

The only spoiler is the wretched movie itself, trying to spoil the careers of anyone associated with it.I kept waiting for it to get better, then for it to end. It only got worse as it went on. After an hour, I could barely stand it any more, but slogged on through to wallow in its full wretchedness.Do angels not speak? I distinctly remember angels appearing and speaking in Bible stories. It would have been nice had writer\/director Tom McLoughlin given some lines to the one actor in the movie we know has some talent - And that would be Emmanuelle Béart. But we only know that from seeing her other films, especially Un coeur en hiver and L'Enfer. This is one even a Béart completist should skip.
