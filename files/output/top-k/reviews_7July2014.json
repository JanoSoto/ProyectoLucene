It has a lot of new places and doesn't just stick around from the first film, travelling across Europe the Griswold family get up to more crazy hijinks and basically ruin everything for anyone that comes there way. I thought it was safely a kind of OK movie, and here Is why.The story is as crazy as the first and never really stops trying the same thing, you could say this is what makes this not the best comedy, but the old jokes still sure do work. It is fast paced and they move around very quickly from place to place, it doesn't affect it but it can be hard to establish characters they come across who just seem like they are all cameos. It has it's moments of jokes, not too many but no jokes annoy so it doesn't quite ever get to be a bad movie.Chevy Chase is good in the movie, his funny acting skill is slightly drowned out by some poor writing and direction but he still does a good job to be the head of the family. I found the rest of the family poor and the two new children actors who took over from the first films originals just aren't funny, it lacks the one liners the first two children brought to us. I liked the cameos we do see they are funny, don't work so well as I previously said but still add to the humour.I'm sad to say Amy Heckerling doesn't do to good of a job here, I think one reason people disliked this movie at the time was because of her direction, she doesn't do enough to bring the laughs out of the scenes. John Hughes has massive talent in comedy writing and even stronger when writing cross country trip comedies, and he doesn't do BAD here, just not great either, the words are the funniest part of this movie and chuckles can be had but I expected much better from such a legend of comedy writing.My main criticism as can be seen is the lack of jokes, they are there yes but don't often come out and when they do you could already be hating the film. Starts very slow and although it does get into a nice rhythm, Chase can't do enough to make it good enough. I also disliked the timing, bit too short or maybe the scenes are too short, much more could have been done in timing the film.I think those who liked the first film will enjoy this, nowhere near as much but you still get some genuine laughs and if you heard it is bad, then you may feel guilty because you will laugh. It has a lot of slapstick type jokes, so for those who dislike that kind of thing stay away for good. This film seems almost as if the family don't bond at all so it could be said if you like dysfunctional comedies.Overall it is a Safely OK-ish Movie, nowhere near being Good let alone OK but still more than just your average comedy, well in my opinion. I think some may hate this, some may love it, it depends on whether you think you have such a thing as class when it comes to movie. Don't think into this film too much and it could have you in stitches, if you do, you may despise it.

If so the issues faced are quite convincing and may hold a place in the annals of Chinese history and literature. The history goes back to mid 1850's when the rich kept getting richer and the poor were become more deprived of any financial gain. To me it the story has a Asian equivalent to the greatest English character in ancient folklore, Robin Hood. The time period was different, but the motives between Robin Hood and Iron Monkey are very similar as both rebels try to outsmart a corrupt government by committing criminal acts for a good cause.In a rather poor slum in China, refugees in the area are being overruled by corrupt governor (James Wong). An incognito hero donning a mask who only goes by the name Iron Monkey (Rongguang Yu) is willing to overthrow this Governor by robbing from him and all the other rich people to give to the impoverished villagers. Governor Cheng lines up possible suspects who may be this mysterious anti-hero. In the middle of this conundrum include a monk Wong Kei-Ying (Donnie Yen) and his young son Wong Fei-Hung (Sze-Man Tsang). Cheng demands Wong to search for Iron Monkey while he holds his young son hostage. Through trials and tribulations, father and son lead themselves to the abode of Dr. Yang (Rongguang Yu) and his assistant Nurse Orchid (Jean Wang). It's quite clear that Dr. Yang is indeed Iron Monkey. This clearly pointed out once the character is introduced.The story is simple and easy to follow through. However it skips through scenes at times which makes the movie feel a bit awkward at times. One minute there's bickering if or if not Fei-Hung may have a roast duck and segues to Dr. Yang and Kei-Ying joining forces to bring down Shaolin Monk Hiu Hing (Shi Kwan Yen) We're familiar with this character and lengths he went through so there's nothing new to inform us about here.Sure the story might be thin and there's a lot of fighting, but that's what you expect to see in an action film. Aside from that the plot of the story actually stands out pretty well. The legend of Iron Monkey has been mentioned in many stories and folklore as he fights corruptions from the Governor who's trying to gather enough money to support his nine wives. The corrupt Monk does unorthodox tricks up his sleeves (literally) that can break through anything. You wonder if these individuals are insured. Like in superhero and police dramas, there will be a lot of property damage and it affects innocent bystanders. One provocation and we all suffer. In a rare occurrence one bystander gets some restitution while the antagonists get what's given to them. The refugees won't expect much left after watching stuff getting destroyed.To me, I felt a little bit of Jackie Chan and Jet Li folded into one package. On the visual format, it's vintage Li. But action wise it has a Jackie Chan flare to it. Sure there's wirework involved and Chan (with the exception of the crappy The Medallion) refrains from using cheap wirework to his advantage. The set pieces at the end will really set your souls on fire. Knowing that this is a fictional period piece film, that's classic Jet Li. The little girl in the film was adorable, but I'll just stay out of her way when it comes to battle. Let her have her duck.

Many of these quickie films were set at summer camps, playing off the success of the wildly popular-profitable Friday the 13th series. Some of these films, like the hyper-gory The Burning, have become cult favorites. Others, like Summer Camp Nightmare, aren't well-known. But there's no camp-set eighties slasher flick cult-ier then 1983's Sleepaway Camp. The movie is most notorious for its gender-bending twist ending. Yet the conclusion is hardly the only odd thing about the film. Sleepaway Camp is one of the weirdest films from the first wave of American slashers.This is mostly thanks to the movie's implacable tone. Sleepaway Camp does not exist in our reality. The film is a horribly uneven mixture of nightmare images, camp, a low budget, unexpected subtext, and mean-spirited violence. The film's opening credits are set over shots of an empty camp, the voices of far-off children playing, a genuinely eerie moment. Early on, one of the camp chefs makes lewd comments towards the prepubescent kids. The other chef reacts not by reporting the man but by laughing off the would-be pedophile's behavior. All of the characters act in this exaggerated, trashy manner. Meg the camp councilors, despite being older then the other kids, still picks on shy, socially awkward Angela. Pick on isn't even the right word, as her language is highly abusive. Despite brutally dispatching the pedophilic chef, Sleepaway Camp also features a romance between teenage Meg and fifty-something camp owner Mel. The movie doesn't treat this behavior as predatory.The movie appears to be an earnest attempt to create a frightening experience. However, any attempt at horror is undermined by how unintentionally hilarious most of the film is. The acting from all involved is terrible. Felissa Rose's lead performance as Angela is somnambulist, characterized by flat line-reading and unblinking stares. Karen Fields as bully Judy seems unsure of how to handle her outrageous dialogue, delivering it in meaty lumps. The rest of the slasher fodder have a similar problem, giving broad performances without even the basic ability to read lines convincingly. As bad as the teens are, the adult actors give even worst performances. Desiree Gould is Aunt Martha and gives one of the strangest performance in any '80s horror film. Her dialogue is spoken in a spaced-out, antiqued manner. Gould honestly seems to have wander out of a David Lynch movie. As bizarre as Gould is, Mike Kellin as Mel is much worst. The mush-mouth Kellin is given some of the heaviest dialogue in the film, a feat beyond the actor's ability. Mel's obsession with keeping the camp open, even with bodies piling up, is inexplicable. When he deduces Ricky is behind the deaths, he brutally beats the kid. An adult beating a child should never be hilarious but Kellin's tone-death performance and the movie's melodramatic delivery makes it funny.The hilarity doesn't stop there. Sleepaway Camp also serves as a time capsule for fashion in 1983. Pastels are the color of choice. One of the male camp counselor wears tiny shorts hiked up to his crotch. The fashion isn't the only source of unintentional humor. The sole cop in the movie reappears at the end, his real mustache replaced with fuzzy duct tape. The movie could be commended for having the kids act like kids. They let loose explicit profanity, play mean-spirited pranks, and generally act like entitled d-bags. The nasty way they act is so unexpected that it frequently becomes hilarious. All of this characterizes the high-strung, melodramatic, trashy world of 'Sleepaway Camp. The whole movie is also characterized by discomfort with, not just teen sexuality, but human sexuality in general. The film has a strong homoerotic undercurrent. At the beginning, we see Angela and Ricky's father with a male friend. Turns out, that friend is their father's lover. In addition to this element, the film is full of half naked teen boys. They wear mid-drift barring shirts, go skinny dipping, and shove their bare butts in other kids' face. The whole film is focused on the kids' budding sexuality in a greasy, unseemly fashion.Of course, the biggest queer element is the infamous ending. Turns out, Angela is actually a boy who has lived his life as a female. The film lets this twist explain away Angela's murderous desire, a deeply transphobic element that probably wasn't thought about much in 1983. The film doesn't have time for that, as its final image of a naked Angela, penis in full sight, is bizarre. Not because of the nudity but because the character's face freezes in an animalistic growl while an eerie hiss escapes her throat.Befitting the off-putting tone, the film's murders are unusual. A man is burned with boiling water, his body covered with bursting blisters. One kid drowns while another is stung to death by bees, the camera lingering on their brutalized bodies. A stab to the back and an arrow in the neck are more typical but pulled off convincingly. The most notorious death happens off-screen. Judy is somehow killed with a curling iron, the implication being that she was stabbed in a very uncomfortable place. As opposed to most eighties slashers, the kids here are played by visibly young actors. That such violence is being inflicted on young children is one more thing that makes Sleepaway Camp a mean-spirited mess of a film.That mess isn't for everybody. Initially, it wasn't even for me. I found the film difficult to swallow on first viewing. However, Sleepaway Camp has grown on me over subsequent watches.

The man who Crowe plays is Professor John Nash a mathematician whose cryptology problems have dealt with economics and other things, but there is one thing that makes us feel bad for Nash and that is that he suffers from a disorder called schizophrenia a disorder where you see things that aren't visible but seen in his imagination. Howard uses an excellent cast Besides Crowe (in a performance that should've won an Oscar) but the film also has Ed Harris, Paul Bettany, Jennifer Connelly, Christopher Plummer, Judd Hirsch, and Josh Lucas, but it is Harris and Bettany who play as his delusions. This was really one of the most powerful dramas I have ever seen with Russell Crowe giving a virtuoso performance. This is in some people's lists as one of the worst best picture winners of all time and that the first Lord of the Rings movie should have won, but from my perspective there was something behind it that I think that it should have won best picture and that is that how powerful it was. There was other things that were good about the film besides the direction by Ron Howard, and the excellent performances, but the other things were, the magnificent cinematography by the great Roger Deakins, the score by James Horner, and last but not least the makeup and costumes. But before I saw it I truly underestimated this movie claiming that Ridley Scott should have won best director for his film that came out around the same time Black Hawk Down but I really think that they should have tied but with this one taking home the award for best picture.

This was really one of the most powerful dramas I have ever seen with Russell Crowe giving a virtuoso performance.

Before I even came in contact with the film I was sure it wouldn't be the kind of film I like, but so I can talk about it I was totally willing to give it a chance.And yeah I don't know if I'm the only one but I think the first 20 minutes of this movie are totally worth it. I liked the idea of the student who has a vision and leaves the airplane and rescues a bunch of people from death. Somehow the movie has really good pictures and also solid acting until the scene comes to the first revenge of death.I don't mean that it wasn't tense seeing Tod walking trough the bathroom and thinking that he will die every second, but his death was just bullshit. I didn't laugh once in this movie I have to say - maybe it needs some friends and drinks to do so - and so I wasn't amused of Tod hanging in the bathtub because why on hell doesn't he just sit on the edge? D I know his feet are soapy and whatever but wtf? The point is The movie is getting worse after a good beginning and there are many scenes in which I think the thoughts of the characters are unreasonable far fetched, and this is by the way something I can't stand in movies. You know I did not expect a realistic drama after a plain crash, but at least something that is fun to watch or doesn't make me wanna say Really?!? and so I am a bit disappointed.To come to a conclusion, I think the movie is as bad as I thought it would be, but in another way I didn't expect. Like I said the introduction was really cool and all things afterwards was indeed somehow exciting, but not good and so I will give this movie a 4\/10.

Of course, these people are generally not critics' darlings, however few if any of their hackneyed, horribly successful films have received the reception that Tom Green's Freddy Got Fingered did in 2001. Roger Ebert no less was one of its most savage attackers, writing emphatically how it didn't 'scrape the bottom of the barrel' and that it didn't even 'deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with barrels'.It is indeed a very polarising film; I concede that it's just an immature indulgence from Tom Green, but at least it's not a load of recycled tedium. It's quite remarkable that this film was financed at all, let alone by 20th Century Fox. What's even more surprising is that this is very much Tom Green's film, no executives interfered in the creative process; it is, for better or worse, the work of an auteur.The film focuses on Gord Brody, a 28-year-old animator\/slacker living in his parents' basement. In the film's opening moments, Gord is seen strewn across his bed completely supine as he narrates one of his draft animations like a blithering idiot. He soon gets a job in a Los Angeles cheese sandwich factory while he tries to sell his work to an important animation executive.Green has an irreverent, dark and extreme sense of humour that he releases through his character Gord in a series of outrageous set pieces, most of which begin with or entirely comprise him shouting maniacally. It is Green's unhinged lunacy that makes the film so... different. Highlights include him violently handbrake turning as he is bowled over by the sight of a horse's penis, his horrifying misinterpretation of an advertising executive's advice, his impersonation of an obnoxious stock broker during a dinner with his new girlfriend and the many altercations with his father Jim (Rip Torn).Rip Torn's performance is a highlight of the film, he is brilliantly cantankerous and frequently clashes with his son, he is the perfect adversary for Green's proverbial slacker. He shows, quite understandably, no faith whatsoever in what he calls Gord's 'doodles'.I've personally always had a fondness for Freddy Got Fingered. Even for its admirers, it can indeed be a tough, tiring watch from beginning to end, I think it largely depends on what mood you're in. Once the viewer has endured what has become quite an infamous 1 hour and 23 minutes, it is a film that's best revisited as separate puerile set pieces rather than as a full narrative.But however you watch it, whether its by yourself with a cup of Earl Grey or with friends and much alcohol (a recommended method), it will ultimately always be funnier than Adam Sandler.50%www.hawkensian.com ","genre":null},{"date":"7 July 2014","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" And Adam Sandler and Kevin James and Rob Schneider and the scores of other popular entertainers who permeate Hollywood.

It's not the freshest story ever told, but makes up for it with an enjoyable cast of oddities such as the Rock Biter and the Luck Dragon, presented in at-the-time very impressive effects work. The Rock Biter in particular is a colourful creation.Indeed, without the effects work this wouldn't be nearly as successful, with an efficient but undeniably bland cast of human characters. Atreyu appears out of nowhere and never really develops, and while Bastian is an adorable performance, it's nothing that hasn't been seen multiple times before. It's slightly disappointing that even in a fantastical world, both the saviour (Atreyu and\/or Bastian) and the 'leader' (the Empress) are white humans- it would have been very interesting to have a more prominent, less helper-role for a non-human creature.The film also sports a notable framing device. While the idea of a plot device found in the 'real' world transporting someone into a fantastical one is cliché, the interaction between a single boy and the world notably indirectly, while bordering on silly and certainly cheesy, nevertheless manages to be endearing. Though speaking of cheesy, one will almost certainly cringe at 'Moonchild', and giggle at repeated shouts of 'say my name!' The film is neither a revelation nor an entry into the upper echelons of Fantasy Cinema, but it's enjoyable, with a nice message for kids. It is certainly a film primarily for kids, but can (just about) be enjoyed by all.

It's a fantastic conclusion to the franchise, probably equal to Empire Strikes Back, if not better. I enjoyed the heightened sense of comedy as well as a more of a fee for adventure, something that was sort of lacking in the second. We learn a lot of new secrets, one of them in involving Leia. For the most part, it's done well. It's kind of shocking to see just how negatively this and the second in the series were received when they came out, and how much their reputations have improved. Overall, I wouldn't say this is anything amazing, but certainly recommended.

On the contrary, they were far from being that. But, of course, if the viewer was clued into this, then, you can be sure that this 1960 Western would've inevitably flopped at the box-office.Considering that The Magnificent 7 was made at the very pinnacle in popularity of movie Westerns, I was really surprised to see how severely lacking in the action department that this cowboy movie was. There was just far too many critical lapses in the action to hold this viewer's undivided attention for this film's full 130-minute running time.If you were to ask me, I'd rightly re-title this picture something like - Robin Hood & His Less-Than-Merry Men.Out of all the big-name actors starring in this picture there wasn't even one, single stand-out performance in the entire lot. The attitude of sheer laziness that prevailed amongst this lot of actors was annoying beyond belief.In between frequently senseless bursts of triumphant music, it really killed me that these 7 rough & rugged dudes in the story all chose to risk their very lives for a lousy $20 (payable to each, if they lived, after the job was done).The biggest bit of nonsense in this story was when big, bad bandito, Calvera, with his mighty force of 40 thieves, actually captured the 7 and, then, inexplicably set them free. Naturally, these dudes gallantly returned in order to finish all the bad guys off.Duh! All-in-all - This over-rated Western was nothing but a major disappointment on all counts.
