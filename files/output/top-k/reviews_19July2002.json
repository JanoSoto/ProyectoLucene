However, after having viewed the other comments expressed and finding that 85% of them were very positive (a clear indication of brain damage), I think that it's my duty as a public service to give a revue. If for no other reason, than to help make clear to those poor misguided comment writters what a grave error they have made.The craft of film work can be very ironic and moronic, and it seems that we never learn, only to repeat the same pattern. Why? Well, money is usually the main and most cliche motive, but other reasons include a large production staff (too many cooks) and current social factors (what's considered 'in'in a movie).Now, having said that, let's take a look at what went wrong. First and foremost there was never a good reason for a sequel. Carrie was a masterwork. Even if you did not like the movie, the acting, music, cinematography, and direction all stand well on their own. Brian DePalma has been criticized for copying Hitchcock. I do not believe that to be the case, DePalma took Hitchcock's influence and created on top of that. Pino Donaggio's score is wonderful in composition and it's unique ability to deliver emotional impact. Sissy Spacek, Piper Laurie, Betty Buckley, et all, delivered excellent performances that gave dimension to their characters. That was 1976, and the movie cost 1 million dollars to make. 24 years and 20 million dollors later we get 'The Rage Carrie2'. The character of Carrie White is not even a part of the movie, yet we get the obligatory 'Carrie2' because studios figure that audiences are morons that will not recognize a sequel unless it has a name tie-in. The intro to the movie is bland with no build up to the title as in the first movie, an indication of a bad product right from the start.This takes us to the characters and main plot. We have the lead character, who has Marilyn Manson posters on her walls and dresses accordingly (like you would imagine an average high schooler of the time to look like) and has a small group of friends, yet the jocks and the cheerleaders don't like her. Sounds great to me! But for some reason this is considered a loss. Then we have the cheerleaders and jocks. I don't know how they did it, but they managed to make these people so unlikeable that it crosses the boundries of entertainment and makes you want smack them around for real yourself. The jock characters ooze testosterone infused male cliches, and the cheerleaders just come off as complainers. In Carrie, the title's namesake was a complete outcast with an obviously long history of peer mistreatment. In this flick we get a girl who has freinds and who's only torment is a set of stereotype grouchy adoptive parents. It is hard to picture a tragedy around a person who seems strong enough to handle it, and the movie suffers heavily from this. We then have the jock turned good guy, the religous fanatic mother (hmmmm, sounds familiar) who's only lines of dialog include poorly placed Bible quotations, and finally the Sue Snell character from the original movie. Why Amy Irving, a great actress, agreed to do this is beyond me. And her character is treated with great disinterest, using her only as a link to the original film.And the plot... Possibly the worst part, is almost a complete retread of 'Carrie'. It's almost as if someone in an office said, 'it's been 20 some years since the original, which has gained a cult following, it's time to make a follow up!' And so, the writters went working, for about 30 minutes. This is the story The jocks have a sinister plot! They (GASP) have sex with other girls in school. Now I don't approve of that, but it's hardly anything new or all that sinister. Wrong, but not a master plan. The good guy jock is egged on to do a few things with the lead character. But since he's the good guy, he falls in love with her. The cheerleaders hate this (it's only one guy!) spraypaint his car, videotape him, then proceed to do something to the girl. The girl, of course has telekinisis, which is actually explained away as a genetic trait given to her by her father... Carrie's father! ok, so that would have made him around 55 when he conceved another kid with a woman that would have to have been in her late twenties. But if that's the case, who is the voice that keeps talking to the girl, moving windows around? And then we have a tatoo that gets bigger when one gets angrier, and a new improved telekinetic 'flex' sound. I think we all know where this is going, and you probably already guessed the ending. To proove that this film has no heart, they quickly kill Sue Snell toward the end without any reason. They even go as far as to re-do a 'shock' finale like the original film.It's that bad folks. THIS is what Hollywood thinks about your favorite films and also how they feel about entertaining you once they have secured you money. You have been warned.

We have the lead character, who has Marilyn Manson posters on her walls and dresses accordingly (like you would imagine an average high schooler of the time to look like) and has a small group of friends, yet the jocks and the cheerleaders don't like her. Sounds great to me! But for some reason this is considered a loss. Then we have the cheerleaders and jocks. I don't know how they did it, but they managed to make these people so unlikeable that it crosses the boundries of entertainment and makes you want smack them around for real yourself. The jock characters ooze testosterone infused male cliches, and the cheerleaders just come off as complainers. In Carrie, the title's namesake was a complete outcast with an obviously long history of peer mistreatment. In this flick we get a girl who has freinds and who's only torment is a set of stereotype grouchy adoptive parents. It is hard to picture a tragedy around a person who seems strong enough to handle it, and the movie suffers heavily from this. We then have the jock turned good guy, the religous fanatic mother (hmmmm, sounds familiar) who's only lines of dialog include poorly placed Bible quotations, and finally the Sue Snell character from the original movie. Why Amy Irving, a great actress, agreed to do this is beyond me. And her character is treated with great disinterest, using her only as a link to the original film.And the plot... Possibly the worst part, is almost a complete retread of 'Carrie'. It's almost as if someone in an office said, 'it's been 20 some years since the original, which has gained a cult following, it's time to make a follow up!' And so, the writters went working, for about 30 minutes. This is the story The jocks have a sinister plot! They (GASP) have sex with other girls in school. Now I don't approve of that, but it's hardly anything new or all that sinister. Wrong, but not a master plan. The good guy jock is egged on to do a few things with the lead character. But since he's the good guy, he falls in love with her. The cheerleaders hate this (it's only one guy!) spraypaint his car, videotape him, then proceed to do something to the girl. The girl, of course has telekinisis, which is actually explained away as a genetic trait given to her by her father... Carrie's father! ok, so that would have made him around 55 when he conceved another kid with a woman that would have to have been in her late twenties. But if that's the case, who is the voice that keeps talking to the girl, moving windows around? And then we have a tatoo that gets bigger when one gets angrier, and a new improved telekinetic 'flex' sound. I think we all know where this is going, and you probably already guessed the ending. To proove that this film has no heart, they quickly kill Sue Snell toward the end without any reason. They even go as far as to re-do a 'shock' finale like the original film.It's that bad folks. THIS is what Hollywood thinks about your favorite films and also how they feel about entertaining you once they have secured you money. You have been warned.

After seeing the movie, I must say it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. There were some really funny scenes and Ms. Spears' performance was less nerve wrecking than some of the so-called-professionals that are out there. She's never claimed to be a professional actress nor has she claimed that the movie should be nit picked and criticised in detail. It's a feel good movie, a 2 hour trip that takes your mind of the real world and see some young people have a good time. It's not supposed to be an intellectual workout. It was a good first movie for Spears and she did a good job as far as I'm concerned. The story is predictable, I'll give you that, but show me a teen movie that doesn't? For it's genre, it was a relatively good try. She had a good cast to support her performance and lead her to the right direction. It's cheesy, but in a good way. Let's face it, when Bodyguard premiered and Whitney Houston starred in her first movie, that was cheesy (and still is). But people still went to see it and had fun.

This movie begs you to acknowledge and marvel at its strange behavior. I find this very annoying and somewhat pretentious. As if the Anderson, is so desperate for the fawning admiration of Cannes Festival attendees, that he made sure to slow down and point out all the cool spots in his work. Like a bad musician who replays his few moments of decent performance, over and over again. What is additionally frustrating is that the actors all do a very good job. Gene Hackman is, as always, phenomenal. Even Gwyneth Paltrow, whom I usually dislike, embodies her role exceptionally well. However, like Rushmore, the fine acting is cast inside a rather banal and ridiculous script. I didn't really care much about these people, and found most of them simply annoying. Moreover, we're told repeatedly what geniuses these people are, but we never see them actually behave like geniuses. We're expected to just accept them as such. I don't like that. If you're going to embody your characters with superpowers, you had better show them exercising them, at least once.  As such, all we see is these geniuses spiraling into obsessive compulsive behavior and psychotic neurosis. Furthermore, I did not find this movie very funny at all. The funniest character was Danny Glover and his nerdy, unsure of himself suitor of Ethiline Tenenbaum. The only scene that made me laugh was when Glover's character suddenly falls into a pit at an archaeological dig. It was a bright spot of simple, slapstick humor among a sea of pretentious grandstanding. Ignore the reviews on this one. It's dumb. Save your money, go rent something good like Donnie Darko.

This movie seemed to want to be a whole bunch of things but it never came together as a one solid film. The main plot is smart and clever (Dick's) and that is what propels the movie, but man, it is no shock who the secret villain is and the last part of the movie is padded with the typical Hollywood twists and turns that are so forced and just basically tap dancing while you look at your watch and wonder when they're gonna wrap the damn thing up. Speilberg, a gifted director, has to get away from these dark, sinister attempts, just like the disasterous A.I., Speilberg tries so damn hard, using all the tricks and gimmicks available to him and even though it LOOKS good, it's slick and glossy and impressive, these dark, moody films of his never seem ORGANIC, they never seem to be coming from a real place within him. I mean, for crissakes, look at his logo for Dreamworks, a Tom Sawyerish boy sits on the moon with his fishin' pole???? I mean - how 1950's and sweet is that? THAT'S Speilberg - that's what he knows, that is what makes his heart beat, that's why he can hit a home run with E.T. and Indiana Jones, etc. They're fun and breezy. But his last two attempts to make these dark, brooding adult sci-fi films just seem like weak singles into shallow left field. In the long run, they're empty and hollow. All flash, no substance. (Oh, and a horrid cartoonish performance by Tim Blake Nelson as the wheelchair bound tech assistant - he seemed to be performing in a Coen Brothers film. Sheesh!!!)

Moving on, this is one of my favorite movies of all time, it's a wonderful and charming movie that is original, funny, and moving. I think the reason this movie still stands the test of time is because this was a personal treasure of Tim Burton's. You can tell the love that was put into this film, it's incredible the way that it was made and the soundtrack is one of the best albums of all time. All the characters are lovable and a pleasure to watch as they bring this dark comedic tale to life.Halloween Town is a dream world filled with citizens such as deformed monsters, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, vampires, werewolves, and witches. Jack Skellington leads them in a frightful celebration every Halloween, but he has grown tired of the same routine year after year. Wandering in the forest outside the town center, he accidentally opens a portal to Christmas Town. Impressed by the feeling and style of Christmas, Jack presents his findings and his understanding of the holiday to the Halloween Town residents. They fail to grasp his meaning and compare everything he says to their idea of Halloween. He reluctantly decides to play along and announces that they will take over Christmas. Every resident is assigned a task, while Sally, a rag doll woman who is created by the town's mad scientist, begins to feel a romantic attraction towards Jack.

However a series of bombs that seem familiar to him bring back old memories.  He suspects that ex-IRA bomber Ryan Gaerity is behind it as part of a revenge attack and must stop him before he can kill again.How many `bomber out for revenge' movies do we need.  The reason Hollywood loves them is because we get an easy excuse for big explosions.  However Blown Away fails on so many levels.  First it tries to flesh out the characters but this doesn't work and only serves to slow things down. Secondly the action is silly and has no real suspense &#150; it's entertaining enough if you just want to see things blow up but if you want thrills or tension as well then you're in the wrong place.  It's not all bad &#150; but the whole film just feels like it's half-baked, liked someone was stuck with a bad idea but did the best they could with it.A personal bugbear of mine is this whole Hollywood obsession with the IRA &#150; why do characters always have to be `too crazy for the IRA' or have gone good form the IRA etc.  How on earth ex-IRA member Dove gets into the Boston police force is the first joke but also the fact that Gaerity is `too crazy etc' is daft.  Do the IRA put people out for bombing innocent people &#150; I think not&#133;..hence the word `terrorist'.Jeff Bridges is OK but really just runs round with a furrowed brow all the time.  Jones is OTT, it's like he realises that this is crap and wants people to see his tongue is in his cheek.  His Oirish accent is terrible and just made me laugh.  The worse is Lloyd Bridges &#150; is he awake for most of this?  The two funniest bits with him in it is where he is attached to some absurd bomb thing but, even funnier, is him in an Irish pub drinking some black watery liquid that's supposed to be Guinness!

However a series of bombs that seem familiar to him bring back old memories.  He suspects that ex-IRA bomber Ryan Gaerity is behind it as part of a revenge attack and must stop him before he can kill again.How many `bomber out for revenge' movies do we need.  The reason Hollywood loves them is because we get an easy excuse for big explosions.  However Blown Away fails on so many levels.  First it tries to flesh out the characters but this doesn't work and only serves to slow things down. Secondly the action is silly and has no real suspense &#150; it's entertaining enough if you just want to see things blow up but if you want thrills or tension as well then you're in the wrong place.  It's not all bad &#150; but the whole film just feels like it's half-baked, liked someone was stuck with a bad idea but did the best they could with it.A personal bugbear of mine is this whole Hollywood obsession with the IRA &#150; why do characters always have to be `too crazy for the IRA' or have gone good form the IRA etc.  How on earth ex-IRA member Dove gets into the Boston police force is the first joke but also the fact that Gaerity is `too crazy etc' is daft.  Do the IRA put people out for bombing innocent people &#150; I think not&#133;..hence the word `terrorist'.Jeff Bridges is OK but really just runs round with a furrowed brow all the time.  Jones is OTT, it's like he realises that this is crap and wants people to see his tongue is in his cheek.  His Oirish accent is terrible and just made me laugh.  The worse is Lloyd Bridges &#150; is he awake for most of this?  The two funniest bits with him in it is where he is attached to some absurd bomb thing but, even funnier, is him in an Irish pub drinking some black watery liquid that's supposed to be Guinness!

This play was performed on stage in 1993 and had a huge success. Francis Weber felt like adapting his play (he was the author) for the screen and he had a good idea. The action takes place in a beautiful Parisian flat. Pierre Brochant (Thierry Lhermitte) lives there and each week, he and his friends take part in a special dinner a dîner de cons. They've got to invite someone silly and the one who has found the best dumb is the winner of the evening. Brochant has chosen François Pignon (Jacques Villeret) and before going to the dinner, Brochant has invited him in his flat. Then, in a few minutes, everything's wrong his wife's leaving him, he's got a backache, he's got to face his mistress etc.... and Pignon is a bit responsible for this! There are two main types of comic in this film on one hand the comic comes from the dialogues which are very funny with a lot of successful puns. Moreover they're never vulgar. On the other hand, the comic comes from the situation where Brochant is not only has he got to face Pignon but he's got to face unexpected events like the arrival of a fiscal inspector (Daniel Prévost). Above all, the film is worth watching for its incredible main actors Lhermitte who is the perfect hypocrite and Villeret who is full of goodwill and kindness in spite of its idiocy and its naivety (in 1999, he won the Oscar for the best actor in France and he deserved it). Moreover, the other actors are very well used, especially Francis Huster and Daniel Prévost who are both excellent. The only weaknesses of this film are the moment where Prévost comes in Brochant's flat and then the plot is resolved very laboriously. The other moment is when Pignon is calling Mrs Brochant to tell her his real thoughts about her husband you've got a quite conventional dialogue. Nevertheless, if you want to have a good time, watch this comedy it's worth watching!
