Not a single one of his films do I dislike in the slightest. However, he has dabbled in some side projects that don't carry the full Written and Directed by... promise of, say Pulp Fiction or Kill Bill, that aren't the biggest successes. But for a single segment of the four that make up Four Rooms, we have Tarantino behind the pen, the camera, and in front of the screen! It's no coincidence that his segment is actually entertaining. But I'm ahead of myself. Let me review this piece by piece.The Missing Ingredient is both the opening chapter and the worst chapter. It's terrible. A group of witches (Real witches, apparently.) are trying to reincarnate their goddess, but require several specific items, the only of which they don't have is a man's sperm. I'm not joking. So, the witch who hasn't fulfilled her part must acquire her item within the hour. It sounds like the plot of a pornographic film. It's just stupid. The witch seduces Tim Roth's Ted the Bellhop, and some silly special effects later, she has her final item. I can't tell you how much I hated this. Not once during this chapter did I crack a smile, I was just hoping the next part was better. It is, but not substantially so.The Wrong Man is the second chapter. A little more interesting and far less ridiculous, Ted the Bellhop finds himself staring down the barrel of a revolver when he accidentally enters the wrong room when responding to a call. The chaos that comes from a mistaken identity ensues, and Ted is put between a man with a gun and his gagged wife. What I found to be one of the best quotes from the movie comes up here. Something about wearing a bonnet, I can't recall it right now. Though, I felt the situation was a little hard to follow here. Maybe I wasn't really paying attention, maybe it was supposed to be convoluted. Maybe it was because Tim Roth is delivering his lines in an angry whisper the entire time.Seriously, I like Timothy Roth, he's had some great roles in some great films, but god he chose the wrong role here. Ted the Bellhop is a flamboyant, fast-talking wreck. I couldn't understand him sometimes. Maybe that's what made the movie funny but I found it annoying. It was like watching the protagonist of a kid's movie trying to get laughs from children by acting silly, but surrounded by swearing and adult themes.With the third chapter, thing get better. Perhaps it's because it focuses less on Roth's silly character. The Misbehavers is directed and written by Robert Rodriguez. In this fun little short, a tough husband and his wife leave their children in their hotel room for the evening, hiring Ted to check up on them now and then. Don't misbehave he warns. The two kids are portrayed in a funny, childish way and their innocence leads to a gruesome discovery that I won't spoil here; it's one of the few parts worth not spoiling. Rodriguez really gives us this picture of a dysfunctional family headed by a strict father-figure (Who MAY or may not be a gangster!) And this chapter ends with a great scene.The moment I'm sure many had been waiting for was Quentin Tarantino's segment The Man from Hollywood. QT stars in this segment as a drunk, rich movie star. He and his posse are drinking, having a good time. The alcohol in their system leads to them recreating a scene from a Hitchcock story where one of the men must light his lighter ten times in a row, or have his pinkie chopped off. It's really well played out here as the drunk trio of friends (And a character from a previous chapter.) move about their suite, throwing their money around like it's nothing. If you like Tarantino's writing, you'll like this segment. If not, you won't! It's classic Tarantino. Again, Roth is sort of put in the background, behind this intoxicated cast of characters. I think Roth was the problem with the movie, possibly. Or rather, Roth's character.So there. It's an interesting concept that, with four skilled directors, could have been phenomenal. But alas, the filmmakers who directed the first two chapters are unknown for a reason. I think I'd have to say Rodriguez's segment was the best. So, I give this a 6\/10. Really, the second chapters are fun little shorts, and even the second one isn't all that bad. But the opening part is so unforgivable. It sets such a negative tone for the rest of the movie.

His family stares in wonder; his mother is overwhelmed with joy while his 'barbaric' father is proud and regards his as a true Brown, as if he were some street vermin lifted by the family before. This brings to memory another scene where Christy becomes aggravated when his overtures of love are not reciprocated. He dislikes 'platonic' love, something that he has been receiving all the time. In fact, Christy's pain can be understood by not only people with cerebral palsy, but also by others, for example the old people. My grandmother got a similar treatment when she began aging and was ailing. Many a times, this spoon feeding annoyed her and she would refuse to comply. Earlier in the film, a stout, caring lady is in charge of Christy and the stairs is not an obstacle just for Christy, but also for the lady. Christy Brown, however, overcomes many hurdles and became an acclaimed painter, author, poet and an alcoholic Irish rascal! And although without support from family and doctors, he wouldn't have been all this, the true instrument that brought him this success was his left foot. And this left foot became the novel of the same name.Daniel Day Lewis doesn't perform Christy Brown; he lives and breathes Christy Brown. His spectacular, almost detrimental dedication towards his character makes us completely unaware of his acting. Daniel's eyes are his most powerful tool; they are as deep as Lord Krishna's mouth (it is believed that when Lord Krishna opened his mouth the entire universe could be seen inside it). It is one of the finest embodiments of a character on screen. But when one talks of a complete performance, I think that compared to the psychology of the character, Daniel has a harder physical hurdle to accomplish. The reason may be that Christy Brown himself was not a supremely complex person; his indefatigable determination was the reason of his fame and glory. What I mean to say is, it isn't a highly complex performance in its entirety (apart from the mental anguish at being physically handicapped and not finding true love). That I would give to his performance in 'There will be Blood' which is thoroughly majestic in all possible ways. What is Daniel's definitive performance? Most probably his role in TWBB. Which role defines his consummate commitment to method acting? My Left Foot would be the most appropriate answer. Brenda Fricker, Kristen Sheridan and Fiona Shaw provide good support to the film. The rest of the characters are minor and help in filling roles rather than carving individualities out of their characters.The movie itself is a one-time watch &#x96; it isn't much layered in terms of story but mainly takes the viewers through the painter's bourgeois life in Ireland. Some of the moments in the movie are unapologetically shown, for example, Christy's childhood where he is treated like a caged animal kept in one dark corner. The movie isn't a high octane drama but a well tempered biopic. Though I did wish the scenes held more dramatic quality, the breezy pace was well suited for most part. In fact, when I think of Christy Brown now, I get not a commiserable face but a jovial, almost likably wicked one. The last fifteen minutes look more like a 'film' with its almost corny nature but I think that was to deliberately done to give it the 'movie' quality.Do not watch My Left Foot expecting an unforgettable movie experience but watch the film as it is, simple and frank with uplifting performances.My Rating 7 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 February 2012","score":"","review":" Would it not be highly upsetting if you are thought to be mentally slow but were physically impaired in reality?

That being said Metropolis is an absolute gem, a masterpiece of the era, and in my opinion the best silent film ever made.Everything ties together really tightly. The plot, genre and themes go hand in hand and it's hard to break discuss them separately without touching on the other aspects. I'll start with the plot- it's genius. In a society where the rich live in luxury and the poor are their slaves, the son of the mastermind falls in love with a worker and drama ensures, centering around the idea that the two classes must be united. There's more to it than that but that summary tells you enough. While great in concept, the film isn't as strong in execution. The first half is really drawn out, and after a very serious opening the film slows dramatically. However, about midway as the Machine Man is taking its human appearance, there seems to be a dramatic change, and from then to the end is a near perfect film. The film gets tighter and tenser right to the end, with a great big finale. There are three acts, and the last one, 'Furioso' is some of the best film ever, silent or not.Now onto genre sci-fi. By spending 5 minutes on the Internet you can see that everyone glows about how Metropolis is 'the greatest sci-fi ever'. As I said in my summary, Lang wins the sci-fi guessing game. His 2000 is incredibly close to what actually happened, his vision is what we live in now, and today we have even more. And this was all thought up in 1927! It's a very fair statement to call this the father of science fiction films. The city has planes, highways and skyscrapers. There are even small things you may not notice because of how common they are today, living in Lang's envisioned utopia, like picture phones. I totally missed that.But a great concept needs to look convincing, and for what was available Metropolis is really believable. The sets are grand, the buildings very realistic. It looks like a real city! There are effects that seem inexplicable. One really cool part involves flooding and destruction, and with a mix of models, grand sets and movie magic, it's scarily plausible.Metropolis is more than a futuristic story it carries some heavy messages, relevant then and still today. Lang said the message was to unite Communist and Socialist movements in Germany at the time, through the metaphor of the societies. (This justifies the ending, because showing what happened after the action wasn't important). That message can be carried to modern... everything. There has to be a middle, or at least communication between those who think and those who do. It can even be applied to the film industry. Most films can be understood by the masses, but this isn't one. It's layered and symbolic, and I can't explain some of the symbols like Death and the Seven Sins,with the book. A point of discussion is Lang's handling of each class. With the message of unity, he couldn't let the workers be totally oppressed and the rich being tyrants. So a compromise seemed to have been made it can be assumed that the rich are ignorant to the workers' plight, and the workers have a mob mentality their emotions overrule common sense, shown by their restless action and the leaving of their children- something the surface dwellers wouldn't do. Lang's point must've been that despite a joined society being important. neither side was especially favourable.

I'll just have to re-create it what I said before about this horrid moovie.I seem to be having difficulty in posting a review of THIS ONE FILM. All of my other very few negative reviews always got posted practically immediately. I don't see what I'm saying that could possibly be any worse than any other bad review of this film that I've seen on this site, so I'm EXPECTING this to go through. Not to mention I've ripped some other movies similar belly buttons and they got posted within half a day. So I'm directing this to whoever is deleting my reviews if this fails to get posted, it must mean that Lucasfilm has some heavy duty influence over people speaking the truth over their films. This 2nd of the First Trilogy which is actually the 2nd trilogy, or my uncle's sister's mom's cousin's prom dress on a pig, tried to mirror The Empire Strikes Back And it FAILS on so many levels that I cannot count them. It's - Eh, Galactic in its failure.Let's look at it like this This is about Anakin and Princess Amygdalin, right? Well - In Epidose I, Anakin was a whiny, bratty little punk (I think his very forgettable name was Jake Lloyd). He was more interested in Fast Cars than Chicks. Princess, er, I mean QUEEN Armadillo (The Usually good actress Natalie Portman who was miscast and misdirected in these films), was a beautiful young woman (Disguised as a Scullery Maid) about 25 years old it looked.So - Just from the aspect of what we had seen before in Ep I the two were not even attracted to each other, she not to him and he certainly not to her! So - It's 15? Years later and Anakin (Now the grown up and in this film, spiritless actor Hayden Christiensen) and Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) Suddenly run into her - In the entire galaxy, they just happen to run in to each other. And some lame assassin hired by D'Jango Rhine-Fett (Jango Fett played by Australian? Actor Temuera Morrison) (Eh? Why didn't he do it himself?) fails to kill her, so they set these 18 year old, raging hormones, KID to Protect her.This is just the Beginning of the confusion, the plot holes, and the unnecessary CGI and Characters.Well, of COURSE he may be interested in her now, but I guarantee ya he wasn't thinking about it until he sees her. Lucas makes us try to suspend belief - and Fails. But that is the whole premise isn't it... They never show, Anakin as snotty 6 year old Kid, Pining away for Queen Armitage, did they? So we're s'posed to believe in this &#x96; RUSHED romance, to say the least? Anakin says something to the effect that he had been thinking of her the whole time, for 15 or 16 years. The end of Epi- dose I never reflects this and the beginning of Epi-dose II certainly does not. Nothing in either of the movies shows that the two have any attraction for each other. Even in the original Star Wars, there was an immediate spark between Hans Solo and Princess Liea, in episodes I and II there is NOTHING. Just Sudden Teenage Hormones.That takes care of this, the main plot - But Lucasses Multiplication Effect is in full force here. He's already WRECKED our previous concepts of The Force by lamely trying to Explain it in Epi-dose I. The Mitochondria, or whatever they were called, MitoClorians? Are lil microscopic sleeping tablets that Lucas put into the Plot, to make us sleep for 2 hours or so? Some things work better as a Mystery, explaining them away takes away their importance AND our interest in them.Obi-Wan needed to find a missing planet, so he meets up with some guy that looks like an Alien version of Norm from Cheers. Or, Morn from Deep Space 9, which was better in all ways than this tripe. He finds the planet of Big-Birds, and they have been making CLONES for some dead Jedi. Dracula (Christopher Lee) chops off Anakin's arm and runs off with the Death Star Plans. There are simply TOO MANY light sabers being wielded - in the original trilogy, their use was sparse, which made them Unique. There is NOTHING Unique about 50 Jedi dashing around with Light Sabers. Again - Lucas RUINS something cool he created in Star Wars.Sorry Lucas I to like it, but ya can't like Poo, even if it is served up on a silver platter with all the CGI in the universe! There is no style, no substance, NO FLAVOUR - nothing to get excited about.This film CERTAINLY does not mirror The Empire Strikes Back - Which was written by a HUGO-AWARD Winning Science Fiction Writer Leigh Brackett, and Directed by a professional Director.Lucas is not cut out for directing. He had some good ideas that in COLLABORATIVE Effort became GOOD moovies - Willow - Raiders of the Lost Ark. Collaborations. I want to end this by saying, I love moovies, for any Film Maker they get an easy 10 out of me check my reviews, see for yourself. I am VERY forgiving and sometimes I'll go completely Against the grain to rate something high that was a dismal Box Office or Critical failure. If I enjoyed myself watching it, it's a 10. Avatar? 10, even though I thought Cameron stole the plot from a Hugo Award Winning Sci Fi story. Star Trek Nemesis? 10 despite the old tired TNG crew. X-Men? 10. Star Wars- Episode IV? TEN. The Empire Strikes Back? Ten! Return of the Jedi? 10!This trilogy? Z E R O.I DID NOT enjoy one minute of this entire 2 and a half hour waste of my time.

Lucas makes us try to suspend belief - and Fails. But that is the whole premise isn't it... They never show, Anakin as snotty 6 year old Kid, Pining away for Queen Armitage, did they? So we're s'posed to believe in this &#x96; RUSHED romance, to say the least? Anakin says something to the effect that he had been thinking of her the whole time, for 15 or 16 years. The end of Epi- dose I never reflects this and the beginning of Epi-dose II certainly does not. Nothing in either of the movies shows that the two have any attraction for each other. Even in the original Star Wars, there was an immediate spark between Hans Solo and Princess Liea, in episodes I and II there is NOTHING. Just Sudden Teenage Hormones.That takes care of this, the main plot - But Lucasses Multiplication Effect is in full force here. He's already WRECKED our previous concepts of The Force by lamely trying to Explain it in Epi-dose I. The Mitochondria, or whatever they were called, MitoClorians? Are lil microscopic sleeping tablets that Lucas put into the Plot, to make us sleep for 2 hours or so? Some things work better as a Mystery, explaining them away takes away their importance AND our interest in them.Obi-Wan needed to find a missing planet, so he meets up with some guy that looks like an Alien version of Norm from Cheers. Or, Morn from Deep Space 9, which was better in all ways than this tripe. He finds the planet of Big-Birds, and they have been making CLONES for some dead Jedi. Dracula (Christopher Lee) chops off Anakin's arm and runs off with the Death Star Plans. There are simply TOO MANY light sabers being wielded - in the original trilogy, their use was sparse, which made them Unique. There is NOTHING Unique about 50 Jedi dashing around with Light Sabers. Again - Lucas RUINS something cool he created in Star Wars.Sorry Lucas I to like it, but ya can't like Poo, even if it is served up on a silver platter with all the CGI in the universe! There is no style, no substance, NO FLAVOUR - nothing to get excited about.This film CERTAINLY does not mirror The Empire Strikes Back - Which was written by a HUGO-AWARD Winning Science Fiction Writer Leigh Brackett, and Directed by a professional Director.Lucas is not cut out for directing. He had some good ideas that in COLLABORATIVE Effort became GOOD moovies - Willow - Raiders of the Lost Ark. Collaborations. I want to end this by saying, I love moovies, for any Film Maker they get an easy 10 out of me check my reviews, see for yourself. I am VERY forgiving and sometimes I'll go completely Against the grain to rate something high that was a dismal Box Office or Critical failure. If I enjoyed myself watching it, it's a 10. Avatar? 10, even though I thought Cameron stole the plot from a Hugo Award Winning Sci Fi story. Star Trek Nemesis? 10 despite the old tired TNG crew. X-Men? 10. Star Wars- Episode IV? TEN.

I'll just have to re-create it what I said before about this horrid moovie.I seem to be having difficulty in posting a review of THIS ONE FILM. All of my other very few negative reviews always got posted practically immediately. I don't see what I'm saying that could possibly be any worse than any other bad review of this film that I've seen on this site, so I'm EXPECTING this to go through. Not to mention I've ripped some other movies similar belly buttons and they got posted within half a day. So I'm directing this to whoever is deleting my reviews if this fails to get posted, it must mean that Lucasfilm has some heavy duty influence over people speaking the truth over their films. This 2nd of the First Trilogy which is actually the 2nd trilogy, or my uncle's sister's mom's cousin's prom dress on a pig, tried to mirror The Empire Strikes Back And it FAILS on so many levels that I cannot count them. It's - Eh, Galactic in its failure.Let's look at it like this This is about Anakin and Princess Amygdalin, right? Well - In Epidose I, Anakin was a whiny, bratty little punk (I think his very forgettable name was Jake Lloyd). He was more interested in Fast Cars than Chicks. Princess, er, I mean QUEEN Armadillo (The Usually good actress Natalie Portman who was miscast and misdirected in these films), was a beautiful young woman (Disguised as a Scullery Maid) about 25 years old it looked.So - Just from the aspect of what we had seen before in Ep I the two were not even attracted to each other, she not to him and he certainly not to her! So - It's 15? Years later and Anakin (Now the grown up and in this film, spiritless actor Hayden Christiensen) and Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) Suddenly run into her - In the entire galaxy, they just happen to run in to each other. And some lame assassin hired by D'Jango Rhine-Fett (Jango Fett played by Australian? Actor Temuera Morrison) (Eh? Why didn't he do it himself?) fails to kill her, so they set these 18 year old, raging hormones, KID to Protect her.This is just the Beginning of the confusion, the plot holes, and the unnecessary CGI and Characters.Well, of COURSE he may be interested in her now, but I guarantee ya he wasn't thinking about it until he sees her.

This is one of the selected films that does a great job at two different things. It doesn't get too preoccupied with either, and winds up making the two flow nicely without being heavy-handed or incoherent. It has great lead actors for the coaches, great character actors for the players, and a nicely concocted, if simple, moral that ties the ribbon on the package.Despite a few noticeable flaws, the high rating is because the film excels at things other sports films don't even bother touching. We'll get into that later. The film is based on the true story of Herman Boone (Washington), an African American man who becomes the head coach of a high school football team in Alexandria, Virgina, docking long time white coach Bill Yoast (Patton) to defensive coordinator.It's 1971. The Civil Rights movement has recently taken place, and the blacks now have equal rights, but unequal opportunities. It's that awkward period where they have rights, but still seem like they are fighting to prove they do. The blacks, who try out for the football team, are proud to see one of their own coaching a high school. The whites are furious, yet accept that they will be playing in an integrated team, with a black head coach.The town has mixed reception towards the idea. The whites are very sour and skeptical, and the blacks are overjoyed, respectively. The team soon proves themselves worthy of recognition by winning game after game, when they are put through Coach Boone's long, painful, unforgivable drills at a two week camp.There are a wide variety of students on the team, as one would expect. They are religious Jerry nicknamed The Rev because he is always praying (Kirkwood), tough guy Gerry (Hurst), bad boy Julius (Harris), stocky and simple Louie (Suplee), and many others. Even a young Ryan Gosling shows up in many scenes.My favorite character, by far, was Louie. Ethan Suplee has a natural screen talent for the sweet and simple type, but plays the role not as a caricature, but in a very humanistic way. That's the key word here; humanistic. One of the many things Remember the Titans gets right is that it develops its characters, and doesn't believe it will happen automatically without any amount of effort. Screenwriter Gregory Allen Howard gives almost all the football players their own story to tell. Regardless of what they are, he tries, and succeeds impressively.The role of Herman Boone could only be played by Denzel Washington. When you hire Washington to star in your film, you take one look at his serious face and know what you're getting. A fearless leader, that can carry a movie on his shoulders regardless of length or content, and never stumbles or trips up on anything. It is clear he learned something from working on Spike Lee's Malcolm X. In that film, he was a determined Civil Rights leader, looking to do anything for equal rights. Here, he plays a determined football coach, looking to do anything for equal opportunities on and off the field.Like I said, there are some minor things that stuck out to me, more for the worse than the better. For one, the film feels a bit neutered. Sure, this is a bit pushy for a Disney film, nonetheless a PG rated Disney film, but everything feels a bit too simple. A bit too genial. Surely more abuse was caused by the townspeople rather than most happening on the field. There is never really a major conflict that isn't resolved within minutes. Also, the ending is a bit hazy. It doesn't really cement change in a very strong way. It almost makes it seem like the problem of racism and inequality depended on the outcome of a football game.It is common for films involving a teacher, a coach, or a counselor, to take one or more characters under their wing to teach them greater things or to think outside the box. Yes, Boone inspires virtually the whole team, but we never see him interact with any of the team members, sincerely, one on one. He tells Louis in one scene that they'll go over his test scores, and I desperately wanted to see what those scenes could possibly unfold into, but they never came through. The man on man sentimentality lacks, but there is still plenty of motivational speeches to sweeten the pot.Remember the Titans accomplishes a great deal, even if it isn't perfect. The levels it succeeds in, storytelling, characterization, and motivation, are some of the hardest to achieve greatness in, and the film appears to do if effortlessly. Washington steals every scene he is in, the football scenes are crisp and effective, and the feeling we're left with is a keen sense of optimism. For a Disney film to do all that is quite an accomplishment.Starring Denzel Washington, Will Patton, Wood Harris, Ryan Hurst, Kip Pardue, Ryan Gosling, Ethan Suplee, Kate Bosworth, and Hayden Panettiere.

As a lot of people may say this movie is very complicated, it gives away clues, you have to find them and you have to decipher the truth. Really, this is horse s#it.The movie is nothing but a set of loose & lousy acts put together and called a movie. There is no worse thing in a suspense movie in which a murder happens, you watch the entire damn movie, but the director doesn't bother to show you who the murderer was( Exception to this is a movie ' Memories of a murder',which was a breathtaking movie).I'd like to discuss this movie in brief. In the beginning an accident occurs, which leaves Laura Harring amnesiac. She sneaks into Naomi Watt's aunt's house. Naomi is a wannabe actress. She tries to help Laura to find, who she is and what really happened that night when accident happened.I am not going to say much about the rest- the dream, the reality, the hallucination and blah, blah, blah. As a lot of reviewers came up with a simple thing that Naomi ( Diane) is in love Laura ( Camila). But Diane can't become a big star, but Camilla becomes one. Then she is all set to be married to the director. Diane can't take it that her love is spurned by Camilla, so hires a guy to kill her and after that can't get over this guilt and also the shame of not living up to the expectations of her parents that she couldn't become a successful actress,so she kills herself.What I said above is a general interpretation of all the reviewers. But I can come up with another one that Diane couldn't become as successful actress as Camilla, so she might have killed her, and then tried to put this thing into her head that she might have had an affair with the director, to become a successful actress. She might not have been able to digest her failure and Camilla's success. That's why she may have dreamed about Camila's affair with the director.The director didn't bother to unravel anything, so we are all free to make our own interpretations.

Pretentious people will say i figured it out. But actually there is nothing to be figured out. You are all free to make any interpretations you want. The film was directed by David Lynch, and got away with it once again. Had it been a novice director, he wouldn't have been allowed to direct a movie in his life ever again.How dare these so called intelligent directors to make such kinds of garbage. This works because everyone wants to save his face, by pretending to have understood the film. But actually there is nothing to be understood, this thing should at least be understood by the audience.As I already said, this film won't satisfy your answers, so reluctantly you will have to make up your own answers. Apart from a wild goose chase, this film is lousy & boring as hell. Laura Harring just looked like a beautiful dumb girl in the film. Naomi acts well (as she always does), but there is no script in the film, so she can't do anything about it. And also, Naomi was told by David Lynch to overact.This film was so frustrating that even a person who doesn't have an account on IMDb, will be forced to register and slam this pretentious trash.

I am kind of biased towards Naomi, otherwise this doesn't deserve more than a zero. As a lot of people may say this movie is very complicated, it gives away clues, you have to find them and you have to decipher the truth. Really, this is horse s#it.The movie is nothing but a set of loose & lousy acts put together and called a movie. There is no worse thing in a suspense movie in which a murder happens, you watch the entire damn movie, but the director doesn't bother to show you who the murderer was( Exception to this is a movie ' Memories of a murder',which was a breathtaking movie).I'd like to discuss this movie in brief. In the beginning an accident occurs, which leaves Laura Harring amnesiac. She sneaks into Naomi Watt's aunt's house. Naomi is a wannabe actress. She tries to help Laura to find, who she is and what really happened that night when accident happened.I am not going to say much about the rest- the dream, the reality, the hallucination and blah, blah, blah. As a lot of reviewers came up with a simple thing that Naomi ( Diane) is in love Laura ( Camila). But Diane can't become a big star, but Camilla becomes one. Then she is all set to be married to the director. Diane can't take it that her love is spurned by Camilla, so hires a guy to kill her and after that can't get over this guilt and also the shame of not living up to the expectations of her parents that she couldn't become a successful actress,so she kills herself.What I said above is a general interpretation of all the reviewers. But I can come up with another one that Diane couldn't become as successful actress as Camilla, so she might have killed her, and then tried to put this thing into her head that she might have had an affair with the director, to become a successful actress. She might not have been able to digest her failure and Camilla's success. That's why she may have dreamed about Camila's affair with the director.The director didn't bother to unravel anything, so we are all free to make our own interpretations. This is just like a painting of a dot ( mere dot) we go to have a look at, at the museum.One guy says this is the beginning of something spectacular, one may say this is the end of life and another may say after pondering a lot that this is just a fu**ing dot.I was amazed to see why it is so highly rated on IMDb. Pretentious people will say i figured it out. But actually there is nothing to be figured out. You are all free to make any interpretations you want. The film was directed by David Lynch, and got away with it once again. Had it been a novice director, he wouldn't have been allowed to direct a movie in his life ever again.How dare these so called intelligent directors to make such kinds of garbage. This works because everyone wants to save his face, by pretending to have understood the film. But actually there is nothing to be understood, this thing should at least be understood by the audience.As I already said, this film won't satisfy your answers, so reluctantly you will have to make up your own answers.

The husband now has to take up the responsibilities of taking care of the boy. As he does, they get to know each other better. But then, the mother and wife returns, and she wants custody of the boy. Kramer vs. Kramer has lots of drama with some wonderful bits of comedy thrown in for good measure. Dustin Hoffman won his first Best Actor Oscar for his brilliant performance here. Most people say his performance in Rainman, which won him his second Oscar, is his best. He was great in that film, but I disagree that its his best. In my opinion, the best performance of Hoffman's career is in this movie. Scene after scene shows us why Hoffman is one of the best American actors working today. He's also funny at times. Also giving a terrific performance is Meryl Streep, who wasn't as well known when she made this film like she is today. Streep, like Hoffman, also won her first Oscar (for Best Supporting Actress) for her work in Kramer vs. Kramer as the wife and mother who tries to find herself after walking out on her family. Justin Henry, who was only 8 years old when the film came out, is wonderful as Hoffman and Streep's son. He won an Oscar nomination for his role here, and still to this day he is the youngest performer to receive an Oscar nomination in a competitive category (Best Supporting Actor). Jane Alexander is also fine as a conserned family friend. She too got an Oscar nomination (for Supporting Actress where she lost to co-star Streep). Kramer vs. Kramer is a great film from start to finish. Writer-director Robert Benton has made a film that's absolutely unforgettable.

Writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewksi and of course two-time Oscar-winning director Milos Foreman make the most of each part, but the whole product lacks the unity of a masterful biography.At the time, Woody Harrelson proved a curious choice to play Flynt, but he nails the bipolar aspects of the master pornographer. We have so much trouble determining his motives, digging for some sign of logical thought. In most cases, this makes for a frustrating case study, for which you might normally blame the actor for not taking us deep enough. Considering how the film jumps from one aspect of Flynt's life to the next in addition to how completely unpredictable of a character he is, Harrelson deserves praise. He keeps you on your toes like the crazy uncle who jokes so much you can't tell when he's really serious.Then there's Courtney Love.

Hiring a drug addict to play a drug addict is a dangerous game, and not when it comes to working with that person. It's tough to divorce love from Althea, such a controversial public figure at the time and even to some extent to this day.

Those fascinated to any extent with free speech law and censorship will crave more from The People vs. Larry Flynt, especially when the title seems to promise it in higher doses. Edward Norton nabbed a career-making role as Flynt's attorney, Alan Isaacman. Getting noticed by Milos Foreman and Woody Allen (Everyone Says I Love You) at the same time is pretty impressive. He delivers an expert closing argument in the film's first trial that will have you convinced he wins the case, as well as a powerful yet light-hearted opening speech in the Supreme Court's hearing of the infamous Flynt vs. Falwell case, a landmark win for First Amendment rights.The People vs. Larry Flynt touches on so many fascinating aspects of this enigmatic figure, but it sacrifices some depth and consequently the emotional pull. Flynt's life blurs by, and though the writing compensates with some nice transitions, there's no substitute for getting Q.T. with Flynt. The Hustler empire appears to be built in a day a scene in which Flynt tells a photographer that a woman's vagina has as much personality as her face is the most insight we get into his mind as editor. Good writing there, but a fleeting moment in the bigger picture.The second half of the film, essentially Larry's life after becoming a paraplegic, feels so radically different. Larry's stroke garbles his speech and Althea's addiction has her looking like a flying monkey in the Wizard of Oz. Two people who once seemed to have their wits about them become such filthy and disturbed characters.

But worthy as The Gay Divorcée (1934) and Roberta (Spring 1935) are, it was not until Top Hat that the pair reached their peak. The cast and crew are almost identical to that of The Gay Divorcée (the only significant change is the introduction of Irving Berlin as songwriter), and yet the earlier picture was like a mere dress rehearsal for this magnificent follow up.One thing that seems unusual about these Astaire-Rogers musicals is that, in almost all of them, you never once see the two of them kissing. The fact is they don't need to, because all the romantic interplay takes place through the dances. In spite of their age gap and general difference in background and temperament, what both Fred and Ginger had was an ability to put character into their dances, and an ability to seem in tune with each whatever the steps. Top Hat serves as a showcase for Astaire's tap dancing prowess, throwing some particularly elaborate moves in the title number, even working his cane into the routine as a third foot. Of the two, Rogers was actually the better at acting. Look at her face as Fred begins to sing Isn't it a Lovely Day. She is turned away from Astaire, but her expressions show her gradually softening feelings towards him, and when the two get up to dance it seems so natural.The ease with which the leads go into their dances is also enhanced by the direction of Mark Sandrich. Sandrich was really a master at finding ways of making a musical number segue neatly out of a scene. Astaire usually insisted on having his dancing exhibited in one unbroken take, but Sandrich goes one better than that and makes even the dialogue that precedes a dance part of that long take. For Isn't it a Lovely Day the shot begins with a wide view on the gazebo, but the camera moves in as Fred gets closer to Ginger, before pulling out again to give them room for the dance. And even outside the songs, Sandrich is adding a rhythmic, lyrical touch to proceedings. He makes frequent use of sweeping and swooping camera movements, from the dolly in on the word silence in the opening scene, to the through-the-floorboards scan when Ginger first enters the movie, to the final pan as the couple dance off into the sunset. It's as if the whole movie is part of one smooth trick This being a musical, we should not underestimate the contribution of the music itself. Irving Berlin had a marvellous quality that could make a simple song sound momentous. An example of his wonderful touch is that grand, sweeping minor key passage during the instrumental section of Cheek to Cheek. But let's also not forget the part played by arranger Max Steiner. These were still relatively early days for scoring of sound films. Up until about 1933 most movies just had a little music over the credits, a fanfare at the end, and nothing else. Steiner however weaves Berlin's melodies into a living, functioning soundtrack. Just like Sandrich, he helps to make the tunes part of the narrative, such as the way the No Strings melody comes and goes along with Astaire's dance attacks.So what is really clear about Top Hat is that everyone &#x96; writers, musicians, technical crew, supporting cast (honourable mentions to Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore and Eric Rhodes; it's nice to see Blore and Horton as effectively a couple here, as they make a great double act themselves) and of course Fred and Ginger &#x96; are all in step with each other. This is Hollywood teamwork at its finest &#x96; creative professionals all giving their best for a common goal. It's wonderful.

","genre":"Comedy, Musical, Romance"},{"date":"28 February 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The partnership between Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made sparks fly from their first appearance together in Flying Down to Rio, enough to spur RKO into funding a series of high profile movies for them to star in. But worthy as The Gay Divorcée (1934) and Roberta (Spring 1935) are, it was not until Top Hat that the pair reached their peak. The cast and crew are almost identical to that of The Gay Divorcée (the only significant change is the introduction of Irving Berlin as songwriter), and yet the earlier picture was like a mere dress rehearsal for this magnificent follow up.One thing that seems unusual about these Astaire-Rogers musicals is that, in almost all of them, you never once see the two of them kissing. The fact is they don't need to, because all the romantic interplay takes place through the dances. In spite of their age gap and general difference in background and temperament, what both Fred and Ginger had was an ability to put character into their dances, and an ability to seem in tune with each whatever the steps. Top Hat serves as a showcase for Astaire's tap dancing prowess, throwing some particularly elaborate moves in the title number, even working his cane into the routine as a third foot. Of the two, Rogers was actually the better at acting. Look at her face as Fred begins to sing Isn't it a Lovely Day. She is turned away from Astaire, but her expressions show her gradually softening feelings towards him, and when the two get up to dance it seems so natural.The ease with which the leads go into their dances is also enhanced by the direction of Mark Sandrich. Sandrich was really a master at finding ways of making a musical number segue neatly out of a scene. Astaire usually insisted on having his dancing exhibited in one unbroken take, but Sandrich goes one better than that and makes even the dialogue that precedes a dance part of that long take. For Isn't it a Lovely Day the shot begins with a wide view on the gazebo, but the camera moves in as Fred gets closer to Ginger, before pulling out again to give them room for the dance. And even outside the songs, Sandrich is adding a rhythmic, lyrical touch to proceedings. He makes frequent use of sweeping and swooping camera movements, from the dolly in on the word silence in the opening scene, to the through-the-floorboards scan when Ginger first enters the movie, to the final pan as the couple dance off into the sunset. It's as if the whole movie is part of one smooth trick This being a musical, we should not underestimate the contribution of the music itself. Irving Berlin had a marvellous quality that could make a simple song sound momentous. An example of his wonderful touch is that grand, sweeping minor key passage during the instrumental section of Cheek to Cheek. But let's also not forget the part played by arranger Max Steiner. These were still relatively early days for scoring of sound films. Up until about 1933 most movies just had a little music over the credits, a fanfare at the end, and nothing else. Steiner however weaves Berlin's melodies into a living, functioning soundtrack. Just like Sandrich, he helps to make the tunes part of the narrative, such as the way the No Strings melody comes and goes along with Astaire's dance attacks.So what is really clear about Top Hat is that everyone &#x96; writers, musicians, technical crew, supporting cast (honourable mentions to Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore and Eric Rhodes; it's nice to see Blore and Horton as effectively a couple here, as they make a great double act themselves) and of course Fred and Ginger &#x96; are all in step with each other.

Henry Terrill (Charles Bickford). McKay lands in the middle of a dispute between the Terrills and the Hannasseys (ranchers of less financial status) over watering rights on the Maragon property that abuts the two ranches. Julie Maragon (Jean Simmons) owns the property in question. Once the principal players are in place the story develops with few surprises.Peck is good at playing strong, silent types of high moral character and he brings that talent to this movie, but I found him less believable in scenes where physical toughness was required. For example, in the marathon fight between McKay and Steve Leech (Charleton Heston, the foreman on the Terrill ranch) it was hard for me to see Peck fighting to a draw. The role calls for a sensitive but tough man along the order of Gary Cooper. Jean Simmons is similarly miscast I think, she does not fit the image of a strong willed independent woman of the old west. I can better picture a Mercedes McCambridge in her role. But Bickford is perfectly cast as Maj. Terrill and Burl Ives steals the show in his Academy Award winning performance as Rufus Hannassey, the head of the Hannassey clan.While this is an entertaining and satisfying western, it comes with a message. We are encouraged to admire McKay as a peacemaker who subscribes to pacifism. For example, after he and Leech decide to call their secret fight a draw, McKay asks, Tell me Leech, what did we prove? He also tries to bridge the gap between the two warring tribes. And at the end non-violence is advocated as we see that violence begets violence with the ultimate result being mutual destruction of the heads of the two clans.There is some expert horsemanship on display here--the stunt-men must have worked overtime. It is a thrill to see a crew riding through a canyon and a six-team of horses running full out pulling a carriage.The beautifully filmed vistas of the big open range spark the imagination to consider what things were like in the west in the U.S. in the nineteenth century, before autos and too many people. The forlorn little town in this movie is probably pretty realistically portrayed.Finally, the score by Jerome Moross is suitably grand to match the story and the scenery. It is a bit intrusive at times, but once you hear the main melody, you will probably never forget it and forever associate it with this movie.

Both are brilliant, hard-edged dramas involving secrets, psychological games, too much alcohol, and the mysterious and often explosive nature of human relationships.However, unlike BOYS, which was an ensemble piece with nine characters, VIRGINIA WOOLF provides a showcase for two great stars at the peak of their careers Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, then married in real life. The primary focus is on George and Martha, an embattled middle-aged couple who drink too much and for whom bickering seems to have become a hobby; they are constantly at each other's throats, but every now and then we see that this is exactly how they want their marriage to play out.Elizabeth Taylor had already done a substantial amount of high quality work in Hollywood she already had one Oscar, and had gained a reputation as a foremost interpreter of Tennessee Williams. Her stunning beauty never got in the way of her determination to do quality work.Here Taylor, who would pick up her second Oscar for Martha, is all but unrecognizable a blowzy, middle-aged, slightly overweight woman who dresses a bit slutty and makes drunken advances to their male guest Nick (George Segal, solid and dependable as always), who along with his wife Honey (Sandy Dennis at her mousiest; Dennis would win an Oscar for this film as well) have come over for drinks after some faculty party at the university where George and Nick are professors and Martha's father (talked about but never seen) is the president.This is a strange and unsettling film. In BOYS IN THE BAND four years later, the characters' motives, while not always honorable, are usually clear enough to make educated guesses. VIRGINIA WOOLF, on the other hand, raises more questions with each revelation, and at the end, while everything is known, we are not given all the reasons, and a good deal is left to our imaginations.This is as it should be, I think. To reveal too much would spoil the effect that Albee was going for.Taylor is sensational in the greatest role she would ever play, and teaming her with Burton was a master stroke of casting.

And Sandy Dennis as Honey is amazing she puts on an outward façade of ditsy blonde, but as the drinks get consumed and the layers get peeled we discover that there is both more and less to her than we think the first time we see her.This is not always a peasant experience, but in between the ugly moments there's a lot of comedy, and like BOYS four years later, the whole thing, even at its ugliest, is akin to passing an accident on the highway you may wish you could look away, but you can't. Not even for a million dollars.Stunning directorial debut for Mike Nichols, who would go on to give us such iconic films as THE GRADUATE, CARNAL KNOWLEDGE, SILKWOOD, and THE BIRDCAGE.All in all, a film that every serious film buff must see at least once.

In this particular movie, I found it interesting to note that as part of the ending credits, the audience is asked not to reveal the ending to friends because it will spoil their movie going experience.There have been a few TV remakes of the play and the movie, but thankfully no big screen movie remake; normally I would not want to see such a fine movie remade. There are several fine directors and plenty of good actors who could do a good job in a remake and if it were to be remade by such greats, it would help a newer generation find the pleasure of Agatha Christie thrillers. If you can get it from your pay per view provider or if it comes up on the classic movie networks, watch it.

These people may be a little dim, but they are good at heart and you can see the happiness in Antonius' eyes when he is together with them for the first time.But the main aspect of Ingmar Bergman's arguably best film are Antonius Blok's grim encounters, as the young girl about to be burnt at the stake, as a scapegoat for the plague. And the haunting image of a huge crowd of flagellants interrupting a play of Jof and Mia and trying to convince the crowd thery are doomed; hardly any other film is that direct in asking controversial and essential questions about God, religion and mankind as The Seventh Seal.
