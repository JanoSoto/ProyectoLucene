It's like the movie doesn't even need additional characters because you can never get tired of the dialog between these two.Lemmon had already been in several well-known films like Mr. Roberts and The Apartment and Matthau was fresh off his Oscar win for The Fortune Cookie (another Billy Wilder film also with Lemmon). That particular movie wasn't as great as this one because the story couldn't sustain such a long running time (I think it was almost 2 hours). However, this goes by at a brisk hour and a half, even though the introduction of the events leading up to Lemmon ending up at Matthau's apartment is a tad long (so was this sentence). That's a minor quibble though and for the rest of the running time you have a marvelous time.I have already written a comment about how the follow-up to this film sucked and I won't go deeper into that. The reason why this is such a joy is probably that the movie was made just as the innocence of American movies was beginning to fade fast into oblivion. There are some sexual references but they are dealt with in such an innocent way that you couldn't even get a Well, I never... out of the most prudish person out there. It is kind of fun to see a movie from a long lost era and that was probably why the sequel didn't work because you had Matthau and Lemmon say quite a few f-words and that just doesn't fit them.Of course, now they are both gone and you can just be happy that you still can enjoy them in a marvelous film like this.

Selznick might have had more of an influence over this production than some might think- as with many of his films- and he is the one who ended up receiving the Oscar, not director Alfred Hitchcok, for the 1940 mystery-drama-romance Rebecca. But it is to the credit of both that, for the most part, it looks as if both tried to stay out of each other's way and just put up as good as film as they could. And it is a credit to Hitchcock that with a certain change from what one might see in his perhaps more entertaining films of the 50's and 60's also shows his knack at making great romantic Hollywood movie-making. He is given a plethora of the best of English acting talents (Olivier of course is hyped and hyped again just like Brando, but his work is undeniably good here, and yet it's Joan Fontaine who quietly makes her mark quite powerfully even when she is reserved in scenes), lush sets and production decor, a solid 'studio' score by Frank Waxman, and some memorable sequences and set-pieces. There is also some solid storytelling as well with his usual knack at unraveling a mystery piece by piece, with love, loss and deception at the core.Part of the film's success, however, is as attributable to the factor of it being one of the best chick-flicks in history that the film works today. And this time I mean it pretty much as a compliment, perhaps more to Selznick than anyone (Gone with the Wind, of course). The appeal that might usually go mostly for women is not lost at all on the male audience due to the sheer power and hints at what the two main actresses go for. Fontaine is the 2nd Mrs. De Winter, who elopes with the Mr. played by Olivier and goes to live in Manderlay and meets some of the family and other folks. One of these is the one who has maybe the most interesting (naturally, as the antagonist) character, Mrs. Danvers played by Judith Anderson. Her's is a cold, exacting kind of character who has the straightforward, stern attitude of the ma'am of the house, but also with some dark secrets. It's not to say Hitchcock doesn't hav his eye out for other supporting parts and characters (I liked particularly the old guy who's at the shack where the majority of the secrets are house). But he also is able to get the character the audience will dislike the most as the more fascinating of the bunch, and Anderson is up to task.I wouldn't rush to see this as the first Hithcock film to see if you haven't seen one yet, but as an example of what he could direct aside from his outrageous and masterpiece works in the following years this is a fit example. It's also got, basically, an excellent story, and is pumped up with the best of Hollywood decorum and spectacle, with a big fire of an ending that practically on its own makes it worthwhile enough to see.

With a little bit of work on a new script and some updated effects, a pre-existing audience can be made to cough up a little more cash on an idea they saw executed a few years ago. It's a pity that nobody in Hollywood seems to have the sense to say this idea is not going to work, because it could have saved a lot of unnecessary grief on this remake. I do not know whether director Simon Wells believed his relation to author H.G. Wells necessarily qualified him to remake an adaptation, but he has proved himself very wrong here. The biggest problem with this update, in a nutshell, can be stated as sometimes, less is a whole lot more. Where George Pal glossed over small details in the late Wells' novel, Simon Wells embellishes them, and in so doing, highlights the reasons why Pal left them on the cutting-room floor. Perhaps the most embarrassing part is the use of Jeremy Irons as an über-Morlock, waxing all philosophical as the leader of a race that is meant to represent regressed humanity.For the most part, the structure of the story is the same. An inventor creates a machine that allows him to travel back and forth through time. Eventually, he comes to find himself in the distant future, and discovers a people as much in need of guidance as he is in need of a place to fit in. Sadly, Wells feels compelled to add an extraneous and unnecessary storyline concerning repeated trips into the past to save a young woman from dying. Not only does it add nothing to the story, it serves to highlight the paradoxical nature of the central theme. Ask anyone who has written or filmed a time travel story, and they will tell you that if there is one thing you do not do, it is give the audience a chance to think about, much less dwell upon, the paradoxical nature of what they are seeing. Another problem is that too much material is presented in too little screen time. The 1960 film was a lean ninety-nine minutes because it made good use of the time it had. This 2002 remake is ninety-six minutes long because plot threads are discarded so fast that development is an impossibility.Not helping matters is the casting. A soap opera actor is simply not the right person to credibly portray this unconventional hero. Jeremy Irons does his best with a terribly-written part, and it is quite amusing to see him eat the scenery. I think his agent had a lot of explaining to do after The Time Machine premiered. One of the few touches that is comparably brilliant with the 1960 film is Orlando Jones as Vox, a virtual history teacher who fills the hero in on the way the world of the eight thousandth century came to be. I prefer the ring-spinning sequence in the 1960 film for its creepy and impersonal atmosphere, but the Jones-Pearce exchanges have a certain human touch going for them. Which you prefer will obviously depend a lot on how you like to have your exposition delivered. Had the rest of the film been made like this, we would be judging it on its own merits rather than how it fails compared to its august predecessor.Getting back to how the film feels too cramped for its own good, a pertinent quote is when the hero tells us he could come back a thousand times and see the woman he is trying to save die a thousand different ways. Jeremy Irons later explains that this woman's death is set in stone, because otherwise our inventor would have no reason to build his machine. These paradoxes keep spinning about in the plot without any sort of attempt to divert us from the fact that the hero is like a child who wants to control the fate of everything around him. One could interpret the ending of George Pal's film as the hero deciding to leave behind that which he cannot change and embrace that which he can. If this point was what H.G. Wells intended to be in his story, then it was obviously lost upon Simon Wells. Simon spends so much time trying to conform a story that is both timeless and yet rooted in the time of writing to modern ideas that he loses much of what makes the novel a classic that may well be read into the year 800,000 and beyond.Adding insult to injury is the attempt to tie in the hero's experiments with Einsteinian theory. Einstein had many ideas that turned out to be incorrect, but had he lived into the twenty-first century, he would have found quite a perverse delight in cataloguing insultingly stupid film physics, of which The Time Machine circa 2002 has an overload. The 1960 film had our inventor travelling through the ages in order to witness first-hand the proof that time does indeed change space. This version seems to just have man's endless quest to have a beautiful woman to bounce upon as its primary motivator. Not that this isn't a noble motivation for some things, but it sucks as a motivation for experiments that could alter the very fabric of the universe. Roger Ebert also inadvertently sums up another brilliant facet of the ring sequence from the 1960s film Convenient, that when humankind was splitting into two different races, both its branches continued to speak English. So much in this film is left unsupported or unexplained that it is literally a small wonder that it makes sense.I gave The Time Machine, circa 2002, a three out of ten. Even if it were the first-ever production of a film based on H.G. Wells' novel, it would be a sad excuse for a film. With its 1960 predecessor to be compared to, it is a sad day for humanity.

But they're never dealt with at the expense of someone getting their head blown off.Watching it back, it's quite pleasing to remember just how violent action films used to be. Here you have men getting spiked in the neck, people getting axed and a man getting a pole of some sort shoved through his face. And that's just in one scene! The violence here is bloody and over the top, and in my opinion, much better for it. I mean, action films these days have become rather sanitised. There's just a feeling that you've seen it all before. But how many times do you get to see a man have his arms ripped off as he dangles from a lift? And how many times do you get to see that and have Arnie toss the arms away while delivering a quip? Only once.And then there's the bit where Michael Ironside shoots the three-titted whore in the back. Beautiful! I mean, this is meant to be a bad, bad man. And what better way to generate loathing (and secret admiration) than have him shoot a mutant hooker while her back is turned.But one of the most delightful bits of insane violence is when the midget whore stabs Ironside's lackey. You have to ask yourself whether you're shrooming your tits off. But no, it happens and then the midget stands on top of the bar and opens fire with a machine gun. Verhoeven is clearly a twisted man mental, but I can't help but admire him.Also worthy of praise is the shootout on the subway. Arnie is fleeing from the bad guys and tries to haul ass up the escalators. But more bad guys appear at the top. As everyone starts shooting, an innocent person gets killed in the crossfire. Arnie then uses the bloke as a human shield &#150; he gets penetrated more times than a pretty boy in a prison shower &#150; and tosses the piece of meat into the path of the bad guys below. I can't help but salute the complete utter lack of sentiment.I also salute the fight between Arnie and Sharon Stone. I mean, usually fights between women and men in action films are death &#150; yeah, I can believe than an anorexic model can hurt a man double her size &#150; but it at least keeps things relatively believable by having Stone hit Arnie a couple of times in his brain (his testicles). But what makes it a joy is that after the fight, Stone tries to buy some time by offering to tie herself up and let Arnie have his way with her. You know, for old times sake. It's something of a surprise that Der Gropenfuhrer doesn't take her up on her generous offer, but Arnie does knock her out&#133;which is even better.And there's another bit of violence that cracks me up. The evil mutant Benny, in some sort of digging machine, is attacking Arnie. Arnie then grabs a huge drill and rams it through the side of the vehicle while screaming Screw you! at the top of his lungs. It's one of the few bits of possible homoeroticism in a film that is remarkably ungay for an Arnie flick.But there is another little bit of possible gayness in the film. Just take the relationship between Hauser (Arnie's evil alter-ego) and Cohaagen (Ronny Cox). They hug enthusiastically in a video message and then Cohaagen has a big strop when he finally realises that Hauser isn't coming back &#150; he kicks a tank of goldfish over. It seems like he's lost more than a friend.But Ronny Cox is excellent in the film. Sure he's basically playing the same character he played in RoboCop, but he always makes an excellent villain. And I love the scene where he's going to have Quaid turned back into Hauser and have Melina 'fixed'. His dialogue with Arnie is wonderful. You get to f*** her every night, that's right. She's going to be Hauser's babe. And then when asked what to do with all the people that are suffocating because he's cut off the air, he replies, F*** 'em. That's a proper movie villain.However, I don't think the film is in the same class as RoboCop. For one, Total Recall now looks rather dated (look at the 'futuristic' cars) while RoboCop seems pretty timeless, and plus the balance between smarts and action is a bit more even in RoboCop.But that's not to say that Total Recall is a dumb film. One of the obvious pleasures is trying to work out whether the whole thing is a dream or not. After all, when Quaid goes to Rekall to have his 'ego trip' everything the salesman says in his pitch actually happens &#150; the whole plot is given away in one scene. And then at the end you have a white out rather than a fade to black. This could suggest that Quaid is waking up or even being lobotomised. But although it's something that's pleasing to think about, the film is more concerned about action than ideas. And so that makes the film a minor success rather an overwhelming success like RoboCop.

Joe Hendricksson (Peter Weller) is the commander of the Alliance when one day a lone N.E.B. soldier (Sylvain Masse) hand delivers a plea for peace & to set up a meeting. Soon after a N.E.B. spacecraft crashes near the Alliance's headquarter's which contained soldiers & weapons on their way to another planet rich in Berynium, the N.E.B. were going to leave everyone else on Sirius 6B to rot as a new source of Berynium has been found. Hendricksson decides to head to the N.E.B. base & discuss terms with whoever is left & takes the one & only survivor from the crash Jefferson (Andrew Lauer) along with him. Once there they discover almost everyone slaughtered & the few survivors talking of killer robots left over from the war known as Screamers that have evolved to mimic a human being perfectly, trusting anyone suddenly becomes very difficult...This Canadian, American & Japanese co-production was directed by Christian Duguay & is an average sci-fi horror at best. The script by Dan O'Bannon & Miguel Tejada-Flores was based on the short story 'Second Variety' by Philip K. Dick & to be honest it feels like it as there just wasn't enough of a story here to maintain my interest. For a start Screamers is far too slow, after a promising opening scene things settle down & plod along for the next 90 odd minutes & I just found it very difficult to get excited about anything in Screamers. Don't get me wrong as I don't think it's not without some merit but I thought it was pretty forgettable stuff. The character's are clichéd, the situations they find themselves in are & various other films have more than a passing influence on Screamers like The Thing (1982) & the mistrust of each other, lots of soldiers with guns in futuristic settings reminds of Aliens (1986) & robotic killing machines mimicking people was done decades earlier (& better) in The Terminator (1984). There is also a fair bit of political nonsense & a slightly over complicated war that seemed a bit too complex.Director Duguay does a pretty good job, some of the snow covered, post apocalyptic wasteland landscapes give Screamers a nice atmosphere & feel to it with some really good matte painting as well. The action scenes are flat & not very exciting unfortunately, just imagine lots of people running around in dark corridors. Screamers could have done with some decent action scenes, the opening sequence of the N.E.B. soldier being sliced 'n' diced by a Screamer is as good as it gets. There is also a disappointing lack of gore, a few severed limbs & some splashes of blood is as good as it gets.With a supposed budget of about $20,000,000 I have to admit that I would liked to have seen more on screen, there are no big name actors, no big action scenes, limited special effects, limited locations & a few run down factory locations. As a whole 20 big ones seems like a lot of money considering the end product. The acting was OK but no one will remember Weller for anything other than Robocop (1987) will they?Screamers is an OK film, it's generally well made with that Hollywood polish to it but I found it rather forgettable, a bit dull & lacklustre.

Although, he's not the only with an eye for Miss Cross. Herman Blume, a wealthy industrialist also finds his heart to be stolen from the teacher. Now Max finds himself in a love triangle he can't seem to get out of.Wes Anderson's films are usually quirky, funny and brilliantly written. Bottle Rocket and The Royal Tenenbaums manage to fall under all three categories. Life Aquatic also managed to have these elements, but not to the same level as the previous two. Rushmore, unfortunately only offers us one good thing out of the three, it's script.Rushmore is a great film, on paper. It gives you the sense of a smart film, it's just too bad that the brains behind it is all bark and no bite. Anderson and Wilson are great writers, when they are together they can pull some pretty neat rabbits out of hats. Rushmore gets a lot of praise which has me scratching my head. Do people really like slow, boring, and a main character that you simply want to beat the crap out of? Maybe everyone liked Bill Murray so much that they just had to rave about the film, because it's Murray who shines in this overrated piece of cinema.Jason Schwartzman plays his character very well, but his character is so dull and will make your eyes roll more then once. We are suppose to like the main character, but with Rushmore, I found my self begging for something interesting to happen. I was hoping that Max would suddenly stop being an uninteresting character, and someone that I can enjoy on the screen. Alas, this never happens. Bill Murray on the other hand, single handily saves this film from disaster. He is so wonderful in this film and this role belongs near the top as one of his best. All the characters, with the exception of MAX, are interesting. If Schwartzman's character only had one tenth of the charm that Murray pulls off, maybe I could have liked the film a bit more.The film soundtrack is quite good. It helps bring it's depressing mood up a little bit. Anderson always seems to have good music littered throughout his films and Rushmore is a good example. From Cat Stevens to The Rolling Stones, you'll probably end up liking the soundtrack more then the film.Ultimately I can't give this film a recommendation, but I can give it a 7. It may be a contradiction, but the film is well made. Everything flows well with it, the characters, the music, the directing and most of all it's script. But when you have such a talented cast and director, you'd expect to enjoy the film a lot more. Skip Rushmore and check out The Royal Tenenbaums, because it's simply immensely superior to this.

Bottle Rocket and The Royal Tenenbaums manage to fall under all three categories. Life Aquatic also managed to have these elements, but not to the same level as the previous two. Rushmore, unfortunately only offers us one good thing out of the three, it's script.Rushmore is a great film, on paper. It gives you the sense of a smart film, it's just too bad that the brains behind it is all bark and no bite. Anderson and Wilson are great writers, when they are together they can pull some pretty neat rabbits out of hats. Rushmore gets a lot of praise which has me scratching my head. Do people really like slow, boring, and a main character that you simply want to beat the crap out of? Maybe everyone liked Bill Murray so much that they just had to rave about the film, because it's Murray who shines in this overrated piece of cinema.Jason Schwartzman plays his character very well, but his character is so dull and will make your eyes roll more then once. We are suppose to like the main character, but with Rushmore, I found my self begging for something interesting to happen. I was hoping that Max would suddenly stop being an uninteresting character, and someone that I can enjoy on the screen. Alas, this never happens. Bill Murray on the other hand, single handily saves this film from disaster. He is so wonderful in this film and this role belongs near the top as one of his best. All the characters, with the exception of MAX, are interesting. If Schwartzman's character only had one tenth of the charm that Murray pulls off, maybe I could have liked the film a bit more.The film soundtrack is quite good. It helps bring it's depressing mood up a little bit. Anderson always seems to have good music littered throughout his films and Rushmore is a good example. From Cat Stevens to The Rolling Stones, you'll probably end up liking the soundtrack more then the film.Ultimately I can't give this film a recommendation, but I can give it a 7. It may be a contradiction, but the film is well made. Everything flows well with it, the characters, the music, the directing and most of all it's script. But when you have such a talented cast and director, you'd expect to enjoy the film a lot more. Skip Rushmore and check out The Royal Tenenbaums, because it's simply immensely superior to this.

The first was the role of a Nazi fugitive in Apt Pupil; in that case, you fear his character, but at the same time can't help but admire him. The other role was in Gods and Monsters of homosexual movie director James Whale, the brains behind Frankenstein and The Invisible Man (although the movie stresses Frankenstein and The Bride of Frankenstein).Specifically, GAM focuses (apparently in a fictionalized way) on Whale's last few days alive, and his relationship with his gardener Clayton Boone (Brendan Fraser). We might assume that since Whale was gay, he may have tried to directly come on to Boone. This doesn't happen in the movie, although there are scenes where it looks as though Whale is more than a little interested in Boone. How a certain scene tenses you up a little bit is a testament to the movie's strength.GAM also goes so far as to show different periods of Whale's life. At one point, he is recounting to Boone his childhood in abject poverty in England, and we get to see it. Another scene shows his service in WWI; as Whale affirms, no war movie can ever accurately depict the battlefield (They never got the smell.). There is also a memory of him directing The Bride of Frankenstein. These all add to the movie's quality.Overall, this is certainly a movie that I recommend.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"5 June 2006","score":"","review":" In the year 1960, the age of the family drama was ending, and one of the many genres competing to replace it was science fiction. At the time, sci-fi was populated by greats who still have yet to be equalled in their ability to make the impossible seem a matter of course. Although Heinlein was somewhat more prolific, Wells has been adapted to the silver screen far more frequently. The era Wells worked in was one of great wonder and great fear, the end of the nineteenth century and the beginnings of the twentieth. In these times, Wells must have seen so many wondrous and bizarre creations from other men, but one wonders exactly what he would think of the adaptations made of his most recognised fictions. Had he lived to see George Pal's interpretation of The Time Machine, he may well have been pleased, both with himself and that there was an imagination in Hollywood capable of translating the words he thought up into such striking images. As my summary says, even forty-six years of ageing has done nothing to reduce the extraordinary quality of this film.Like all of the Wells novels I have read, The Time Machine apparently focuses on men daring to dream and using their intelligence to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles. The dreamer in this case is a scientist pretty much interchangeable with Wells himself, and the obstacles are an ingrained sense of apathy along with a simple not knowing any better. The film begins with an exhausted, dishevelled Wells relating a story to colleagues. In an early experiment, he builds a small machine that can travel through time, but is only big enough to carry a cigar. After his experiment is met with skepticism and culture shock by these colleagues, he begins testing a full-scale version of the machine, and thus begins some of the most striking effects shots of the era. Snails move as fast as sports cars, flowers bloom and wither in mere seconds, while the ravages of time beat down buildings as quickly as they are built. Clever uses of time-lapse photography make these early establishing sequences a delight to watch.Our hero makes a few quick stops on his journey to see what the future holds for humanity. At the time the film was released, the Vietnam war was still looming over the horizon, so the prediction of an all-consuming, presumably nuclear, war in 1966 was a bit off. Nonetheless, after spending thousands of years inside a mountain formed from lava, Wells' proxy comes to a stop in the eight-hundredth century, and thus the real meat of the story begins. At first, he finds himself surrounded by vegetation that could only have been conceived by an early believer in the flower power movement. When he finds people, he is at first bemused by their seeming tranquility, but shocked by their complete apathy towards their own, and each other's, lives. Saving a woman from drowning as her fellows look on in a seemingly apathetic stupor, the hero joins them for a meal and begins asking where he might find knowledge to answer his questions about their society. Shown a library that has fallen into decay, he angrily storms off, thinking his hosts a pathetic host of apathetic miscreants.Regarding their society, however, he soon gets more answers than he bargains for when he tries to return to his machine, only to find that someone has taken it inside the concrete bunker he parked it near. The woman he rescued earlier comes to talk to him, and he builds a fire for them to sit around. When his back is turned, however, we are introduced to the mysterious other element of this weird new world that keeps it working. Dragged away by a strange green-skinned creature, our heroine is only rescued when our hero shows a propensity to use his fists that serves him well later in the story.

At the time, sci-fi was populated by greats who still have yet to be equalled in their ability to make the impossible seem a matter of course. Although Heinlein was somewhat more prolific, Wells has been adapted to the silver screen far more frequently. The era Wells worked in was one of great wonder and great fear, the end of the nineteenth century and the beginnings of the twentieth. In these times, Wells must have seen so many wondrous and bizarre creations from other men, but one wonders exactly what he would think of the adaptations made of his most recognised fictions. Had he lived to see George Pal's interpretation of The Time Machine, he may well have been pleased, both with himself and that there was an imagination in Hollywood capable of translating the words he thought up into such striking images. As my summary says, even forty-six years of ageing has done nothing to reduce the extraordinary quality of this film.Like all of the Wells novels I have read, The Time Machine apparently focuses on men daring to dream and using their intelligence to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles. The dreamer in this case is a scientist pretty much interchangeable with Wells himself, and the obstacles are an ingrained sense of apathy along with a simple not knowing any better. The film begins with an exhausted, dishevelled Wells relating a story to colleagues. In an early experiment, he builds a small machine that can travel through time, but is only big enough to carry a cigar. After his experiment is met with skepticism and culture shock by these colleagues, he begins testing a full-scale version of the machine, and thus begins some of the most striking effects shots of the era. Snails move as fast as sports cars, flowers bloom and wither in mere seconds, while the ravages of time beat down buildings as quickly as they are built. Clever uses of time-lapse photography make these early establishing sequences a delight to watch.Our hero makes a few quick stops on his journey to see what the future holds for humanity. At the time the film was released, the Vietnam war was still looming over the horizon, so the prediction of an all-consuming, presumably nuclear, war in 1966 was a bit off. Nonetheless, after spending thousands of years inside a mountain formed from lava, Wells' proxy comes to a stop in the eight-hundredth century, and thus the real meat of the story begins. At first, he finds himself surrounded by vegetation that could only have been conceived by an early believer in the flower power movement. When he finds people, he is at first bemused by their seeming tranquility, but shocked by their complete apathy towards their own, and each other's, lives. Saving a woman from drowning as her fellows look on in a seemingly apathetic stupor, the hero joins them for a meal and begins asking where he might find knowledge to answer his questions about their society. Shown a library that has fallen into decay, he angrily storms off, thinking his hosts a pathetic host of apathetic miscreants.Regarding their society, however, he soon gets more answers than he bargains for when he tries to return to his machine, only to find that someone has taken it inside the concrete bunker he parked it near. The woman he rescued earlier comes to talk to him, and he builds a fire for them to sit around. When his back is turned, however, we are introduced to the mysterious other element of this weird new world that keeps it working.

Almost everything about Possession is twisted and\/or bizarre; so I suppose it is fitting that the film was included on the British censors' 'Video Nasty' list back in the eighties. Don't get me wrong, there's a fair amount of gore on display; but the inclusion of this film on the list is yet another sad example of censorship depriving the general public of a movie that really deserves to be seen. Possession starts off like any drama following the break-up of a relationship. Mark has just returned from a business trip to find that his wife wants to leave him. Naturally, he deduces that the ending of their relationship is down to another man; and he's not wrong - but things take a turn for the sinister when she leaves her lover for...something else.The style of the movie is superb throughout, as director Andrzej Zulawski manages to create an atmosphere that is sexy, surreal and bubbling with mystery. Zulawski's use of the camera is fascinating, as by keeping everything mobile he manages to aptly convey the characters' fractured mentality, and continue to build the mystery surrounding the central plot. Indeed, the film is a labyrinth of sub-plots, and many of them don't really go anywhere - but everything in the film serves a purpose; even if that purpose often is simply making the film even more bizarre. A trio of great performances make up the movie. Sam Neill is superb in the lead role and, unlike in his more popular films, he actually gets to act here. Isabelle Adjani is scintillating in her role, and while it appears that she doesn't have much to do; she actually carries the film's biggest burden as it must be difficult to convince an audience that you're in love with something that isn't human.

I just saw it again for the umpteenth time.Other favorite scenes include his emotional confrontation with Skylar, in which he finally drops all pretenses and shows her the real him, and the final emotional scene with Sean, when Will finally bursts open like a dam.Oh, lest I forget, Lambeau's surprise in the beginning, when he finds out who's been solving his mathematical puzzles, is a gem.Everyone was outstanding. For Robin Williams, this performance ranks right up there with Awakenings, Good Morning Vietnam, and Dead Poet's Society; the breadth and depth of the characters he's portrayed in all of these movies is amazing. He rightly deserved the Oscar. The man's a d*** genius.Hard to believe this is the same guy who played Mork.It's just too bad he hasn't had very many of these kinds of roles, and too many of the soppy, sentimental melodramas like Bicentennial Man.Mini Driver, though I'm not a fan of hers, was also very good, and added the right balance to Will.Everyone, and everything about this movie was excellent; it hit all the right notes.

This film has a great plot, get an FBI agent into the miss USA pageant as there is a mad man on the loose trying to kill the ladies. unfortunately the only FBI agent available is a tomboy, with no lady like qualities, that's Sandra, and she does a fab job with it.Having said how much I like Sandra, this film though belongs to Michael Caine in a great role as a camp mentor to the contestants, he plays this part to perfection and should have been nominated for a supporting Oscar. The other stand out performance comes from Candice Bergen as the ever so slightly mad organiser of the show. Brilliant.So it's camp, has some great acting and cameo parts and William Shatner singing through the mayhem. It can't get better than that can it.

It has several major flaws. The first is a lack of a central conflict. The illegal mining plot which is the basis for the apparent climax of the movie is introduced more than halfway through. The love triangle which should be the basis of the conflict isn't very well handled. The filmmakers were apparently not interested in making any sort of point about multiple marriage and don't handle a lot different than any other triangle situation, nor are we ever really sold on Elizabeth and Ben.The other major problem, and this is a huge problem for a musical, is that the songs seem to be essentially interludes in a straight movie, not integral like they should be. They serve to make the movie longer, but very few actually move the plot around, revolve around characters making decisions, etc as is usually the case. In fact, I can't think of any singing conversations. It's all solos and chorus stuff. The parody on The Simpsons was catchier than any of the songs actually in the movie. The song with the town-folk and the Parson in front of the whorehouse is the only song that actually seems like it belongs in this movie, though They Call the Wind Mariah is also decent. There are related problems with the music. For instance, the French tarts aren't given a single number, which seems like a huge oversight.IMDb's trivia says that Paint Your Wagon went way over schedule and over budget. I'm guessing this was a case of too many cooks in the kitchen and with a tighter creative team, it could have been much better.

But it still holds some interest. It's a whole mishmash of racial issues, of the director and of the actors (many scenes seem to be improvised) dealing with their own thoughts. Often Lee shows his own prejudices. In 1991 at least, it doesn't seem like he thought black people and white people should be involved romantically. When Lee was promoting the film at the time, he implied that people of two different races were only attracted to each other because of stereotypes they had in mind. I think we still have a ways to go, but I think a lot of the barriers that may have been in place in 1991 have crumbled. The two main characters, played by Wesley Snipes and Annabella Sciorra, are fairly weak. I don't think either of them are especially good actors. Snipes has always been rather mediocre. The film is much stronger with its supporting characters. Samuel L. Jackson was much lauded for his performance as a crackhead. He is very good, though I think Lee makes him a bit too humorous at times (though certainly he is downright frightening at others). I also thought John Turturro was excellent as the boyfriend Sciora dumps for Snipes. Honestly, I don't think Turturro can do any wrong. The film ends on the silliest note possible. Still, I rather liked it for the most part.
