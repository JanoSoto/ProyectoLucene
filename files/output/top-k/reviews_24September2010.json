[{"date":"24 September 2010","score":"5 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" Finally found something worse than me, huh?.I'm somewhat of a rabid Radha Mitchell fan (the woman is gorgeous and talented; she should be a much bigger star), so seeing her in a solid, gritty sci-fi\/horror flick like this is a pretty good use of two hours for me.The basic story is about a transport ship (piloted by Mitchell's character) that is forced to crash land on an unknown planet. A planet that happens to be inhabited by deadly, light- sensitive predators that come out to feast every twenty-two years when a cosmic event shields the planet from its three suns for a time. One of the passengers of the ship also happens to be a deadly, light-sensitive predator (Vin Diesel) on his way back to the maximum-security prison world that he escaped from. The rest of the crash survivors are forced to rely on Riddick because of his ability to see in the dark and his natural survival instincts, but will he ultimately help them escape, or leave them to their dark fates?Pitch Black isn't perfect. There are a few rather large plot holes (What do the beasts do for the rest of the twenty-two years, just hang out? And what do they live off of on such a barren planet?), but nothing that really took me out of the story. Some of the characters are overly dumb, annoying, or inexplicably antagonistic, but such story devices and character archetypes come along with the genre, more often than not. The special effects and monster designs do look their age, but that can be forgiven in a movie that's more than eleven years old, and they're really not any worse than what you'd see today on the average made-for-TV sci-fi flick. On the other hand, the filmmakers did do a good job of using visual trickery to make the outback of Australia where the movie was filmed look a lot like a harsh, alien world, and on a small budget I'm assuming. So they get props for that.As for what I liked about Pitch Black, it was a pretty entertaining ride. Mitchell was great as the flawed, conflicted pilot unceremoniously promoted to leader, and Diesel was well- suited for Riddick, who's really the main character of the movie. There are likable characters to get attached to and fear for, several tense situations (though calling the movie scary would be a stretch), and a solid amount of action. All in all, Pitch Black was a pleasant surprise. I was more impressed with Diesel than I've been at any other movie of his that I've seen, and none of the lesser elements of the movie are significant enough to stand out much. Recommended.

Part of this is Kubrick's style, as his movies have often been detached and almost cold, and part of it is deliberate.When we have something we feel is important and want to understand it, but what we are told is vague or uncertain, we keep guessing and trying to figure it out, and that uncertainty keeps us going to achieve enlightenment. More often than not when it is finally revealed to us we either feel disappointment, that it was somehow less than we expected, or we reject it and keep looking for more answers.Two things to remember is 2001 is a work of fiction, and therefore can be open to revision and reinterpretation from what it originally may have meant, such as in the ho-hum 2010 sequel, and it was also done by a human being just like one of us. A very smart one who was good at what he did but nonetheless a person, so nothing in 2001 should be considered as some greater message or doctrine, it's the story he gave to us.So here goes, 2001 is essentially the story of the evolution of the human intellect. The monolith is an enabler as much as a symbol of each turning point. I've heard one interpretation that the monolith represents the movie screen itself (turn the thing sideways) and is Kubrick wanting us to think about the movie, and each appearance of the monolith is accompanied by that awful wailing music which is meant to jar us and make us realize we're at a turning point where we won't see things the same. I agree with this view.We begin with humans as Australopithecus, who are physically vulnerable to attacks by animals and other tribes, until we learn to use tools. This is the first appearance. The second is when we have reached the moon. This is essentially the stage we're at now, and why the thing is on the moon is it required us to become technologically and mentally developed enough to find it. The turning point here is we are finally realizing we need to look beyond ourselves.The third stage precedes the next appearance of the monolith, makes up the bulk of the movie, and also has generated the most controversy. If the signal from the moon monolith had instead gone to some distant star and the spaceship scene was thousands of years later then it would have been easy to see it as another stage. Instead it's only 18 months later.The development is our technology has started to outpace us. We (as in the astronaut's behavior) are becoming cold and cerebral, and the computer is more emotional than us.HAL has his infamous fault where he decides to kill the crew. I've seen this as he was given a mission of critical importance, that there was an alien intelligence that had directed us to Jupiter, and questioned if the crew could handle both the secret and finding out he'd been withholding it. HAL decides it's too much of a risk and that to complete the mission without them is the way to go.In this scenario we are at a turning point, we cannot go any further as we rely more and more on machines, and in the process become more artificial in our behavior, while computers like HAL may act more human but are still equipment and can make decisions that are ultimately inhuman.The last stage is almost purely symbolism. Dave goes on a trip, whether physically to somewhere else, dimensionally to another plane of existence, or in his mind alone is beside the point. (Although most people seem to think he traveled across the stars is the most satisfying answer).The room at the end similarly could be a construct by the alien intelligence to give him something easier to relate to, a transcendental dream, or Dave's mind finding some way to rationalize what is going on. What does happen is Dave reaches the next stage, where we no longer need our frail bodies that age or our technology, and he becomes the infamous Star Child. How he actually does this or what this next stage allows us to achieve is left out.So there it is, take my interpretation or leave it. Some things don't work too well; such as the stage of humanity finding the second monolith on the moon doesn't come across as much of a turning point as the others, the movie implies we're facing an alien intelligence, but instead of giving us motives we're stuck with the sci-fi workaround of intelligences beyond our comprehension, and lastly now that Dave is the Star Child, just what is he going to do with himself aside from float around?
