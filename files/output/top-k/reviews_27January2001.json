Scary movie looked like an interesting parody, but it's become one of the worst comedies ever made. Titus was bad too; although I personally had hoped for another great big-budget film such as Gladiator or The Patriot; considering that the story was originally written by Shakespeare, of course.  Well, Brother might even be worse than those two previous films.  I can hardly think of a picture that is so brainless and far-fetched at the same time.  I thought that this would be another great crime-action-thriller with impressive stunts and great action scenes such as in Mission Impossible 2, or a film that has some interesting characters or maybe even a pretty original storyline - or decent acting performances - or excellent camerawork - whatever. But this film has nothing.  The storyline is one of the worst ever.  The acting is very weak.  There's absolutely no talking about a director since the camerawork is not even worth mentioning.  Still, I have seen films that were pretty good in spite of a lousy storyline, acting AND shooting.  The reason why is because they compensate this 'emptiness' with breathtaking visuals such as exploding vehicles or buildings, awe-inspiring car chases or overwhelming special effects that look great on a big screen.  Nothing of this kind is to be seen in this brutal picture. I do realize that this is not an American picture, but at times it's simply too ridiculous for words.  I know that the Chinese people live in a whole different world from ours, but there are multiple scenes that are so bad that I start to wonder how this film ever made it to Europe and America.* POSSIBLE SPOILERS *To me these are the worst scenes in the film A man cuts off his own finger because he has to apologize. Another man wants to show his respect towards his friend and shoots himself in the head. There's a guy who slashes his own belly in order to prove to the rest that they can really trust him.  His intestines are spilling out and the 'fake' blood makes the whole thing too messy.  This kind of humour isn't funny anymore and if this is to be taken seriously, than this is a picture for mentally handicapped people. But there's more to come.  The characters are most uninteresting, especially the main character of the film.  This guy is supposed to be tough, but instead he's awfully monotonous.  The film tries very hard to be original and amusing, but fails miserably!  The whole concept of the film is so unbelievable that you would like to turn back time with the intention of choosing a different film. The plot is a failure as well and the emotional scenes were awful and they didn't have any effect on me whatsoever.  I guess I expected to see some great fighting scenes, but even that was out of the question.  Unless you want to throw your money down the drain, I highly recommend you NOT to go and see this film.  Most likely, there are better films to be seen than this one here.

I believe that she's an underrated actress.  She should be getting more and better scripts and she should be as famous as other great actresses such as Michelle Pfeiffer or Cameron Diaz.  Sandra Bullock has always been very convincing as an actress.  Because she plays all of her parts so naturally and emotionally, it's become impossible NOT to like her.  And on top of that, she's a very beautiful woman.  So even if the film isn't any good, you can still hold on to that everlasting beauty of hers.  Either way it's always a pleasure watching a Sandra Bullock-film. But in this case the film isn't bad at all.  The storyline is good and although this is a drama, there are multiple scenes that are quite amusing.* POSSIBLE SPOILERS *The story is about a couple (Viggo Mortensen and Sandra Bullock) that is addicted to just two things parties and alcohol.  They hardly take responsibility for their actions and they spoil other people's fun.  The film begins with Sandra Bullock who is late for her sister's marriage.  This is bad, but things get worse - much worse!  As drunk and disorderly as they are, Sandra Bullock ruins the wedding by falling onto the wedding cake.  In order to make up for her mistakes, she decides to buy a new wedding cake.  She takes the limousine and the next moment she's drunk-driving with the purpose of finding a cake store as soon as possible.  But instead of doing that, she has an accident and destroys the front of a beautiful house.  This incident is the straw that breaks the camel's back.  She has to enter a drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre.  At first she's very persistent and annoyed with the rules of the centre, but when Steve Buscemi (who is in charge) threatens to send her to prison she's willing to co-operate.  From that moment on, she really tries her best to get a grip on her life and to forget about her alcohol addiction.  She's even making new friends at the centre who'll support her if necessary.  Her relationship isn't getting any better, because she's changed a great deal and as a result of that she's become a different person - and he is still the same alcoholic.  When she's released from the centre, she's determined to live a normal and healthy life.  She will no longer live the life of an alcoholic.  It's time to take responsibility for her actions and to take control of her own life.  Because her friend is still an alcoholic who's now very dangerous for her (since he intends to bring her back to the ONE life she intends to leave behind) she decides to leave him; and she doesn't regret it.  So, a happy ending after all.Overall the acting performances are good, but Steve Buscemi and (especially) Sandra Bullock are quite outstanding.  This is, I believe, Sandra Bullock's best performance so far.  The storyline (as mentioned before) is good and very original too.  This film could have easily been just another dark and serious picture based upon true facts.  Instead, it's become less dramatic because of several amusing scenes and a fine-looking Sandra Bullock.  The special camera-effects (used to point out that Sandra Bullock's character is drunk or feeling nauseous) are quite good. All in all, this is a much better film than I expected and you WILL be entertained for the whole time being (whether you are drunk or sober).

Although the background was visually beautiful, I kept thinking that this portion of the movie would never end.I was delighted to see the attention to detail with regards to sets and costuming and really enjoyed watching the creative process of film making.  There are a few segments from Nosferatu that are blended quite well with the new film clips made to match them.  Willem Dafoe does a wonderful, hammy job playing Max Schreck.  The cinematography is really very beautiful (even though excessively dark at times), and the transition to and from the film within a film was fascinating... for a while, that is.Then something happened about midway through the film, roughly around the time that John Malkovich's German accent began to fade in and out.  It became boring.  It seemed as though none of the characters were going to receive any more development.  We were stuck with simply finishing the shoot.Yet there are hints that there may have been more to the film than appeared on the screen.  Murnau is seen going to some place where there is lots of sexual decadence is going on all around him.  His leading lady has a morphine addiction.  He has a laudanum addiction.  One of the cast members apparently disappears, yet no one seems to notice.Without giving any plot elements away, let's just say that this film is very loosely based on the filming of Nosferatu.

That scene could've become a classic, the effects are fantastic and the editing it's so... so... just incredible, i mean we're talking about Robert Zemecks, he has made fantastic movies during his career, from Death Becomes Her to everybody's favorite Contact. To sum up Congratulations to all the cast and crew!

What begins as a visible piece of information is soon enough a disturbing one.  Too much of something is bad enough.  It's irrelevant to show that name so many times.  If it were truly so important, they should have called the film FedEx.  But instead, they named it Cast away, because the film is about a man who works at FedEx, (just so you know) and who is involved in a plane crash.  He's the only survivor and finally lands on a deserted island.  On this island, there is no one who can help him and he has to learn how to take care of himself in order to survive.  Well, I know why they called this film CAST away.  This is because the cast is the only decent thing about the film.  All the rest is not good up to very bad, with the exception of a few sparkling moments. Director Robert Zemeckis obviously overestimated himself when he thought he was capable of making two films at such short notice.  His previous work What lies beneath became a huge success and rightly so it's one of the best things he's ever done, unlike his next film that came out only a few months later. Because Cast away could have been much better if things had been done a little bit different.  For example the first 10 to 15 minutes are monotonous and far from interesting; but because this is just the beginning of the film you watch with great anticipation.  It only gets better after 20 minutes or so when Tom Hanks is heading for his plane.  From that moment on until his gets back home is unquestionably the best part of the film.  This one big sequence is the main reason why you want to spend your money on this picture, because the rest is weak, predictable and sometimes even unbelievable.  As said before the beginning is very weak, but unfortunately the ending of the film is even worse.  After the whole island-event (when Tom Hanks gets back home), you are really anxious to know how he's going to pick up his life again.  What follows is very weak and incredibly disappointing.  The most disturbing part of the film is the incredibility of the character of Tom Hanks.  This man must have a heart of stone and an everlasting patience.  The fact that he is stuck on that island for more than four years should have made him at least a bit emotional.  But instead he is inhumanly cool as he never gets aggressive or feels very miserable.  He never started doing weird things or behaved really abnormal - he NEVER lost it for a single moment in the whole time he spent on that island.  He even manages to stay calm when he finds out that his wife has married another guy in the mean time.  This whole aspect is simply too unbelievable to be even remotely true. As said before the ending is awful.  It's an open ending which isn't meant to be one.  It would have been much better if Tom Hanks got involved with another woman (why not the beautiful lady who he talked with at the end of the film?).  Anyway, it's stupid how they ended the film in a dramatic way rather than a happy one. But there are also positive sides to this film.  The acting of Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt is very good indeed.  Although these are not Oscar-worthy performances, both actors show why they did already receive an Academy Award before.  (Tom Hanks with Forrest Gump and Philadelphia and Helen Hunt with As good as it gets).  If it weren't for the many ups and downs in this film, you would really care about the characters. The best scene of the whole film is, beyond any doubt, the plane crash.  It is very well done and dreadfully realistic.  DON'T see this film if you have planned going on holiday by plane any time soon!  That scene really got to me and it was very gripping.* POSSIBLE SPOILERS* Along with this breathtaking plane crash-scene, my favourite part of the film is where director Robert Zemeckis shows that man truly IS a social human being.  No person is meant to be alone and this is beautifully demonstrated in the film.  At a certain moment, Tom Hanks stumbles across some FedEx-boxes.  In one of those boxes he finds a ball.  After he cut himself pretty badly he decides to draw a face (in blood) on the ball, so it would be as if he weren't all alone.  What starts as a crazy idea becomes soon enough an indispensable one.  The ball becomes his best friend and he starts talking to it.  When he is fed up with talking to that ball, he throws it away.  But (and this is one of the few but very good moments in the film), because he can't live without it he starts looking for it again soon enough.  Eventually, he loses his best friend and this is supposed to be a touching moment, but it's simply not powerful enough as we do not experience the same friendship towards the ball as Tom Hanks does in the film.  Also, it would have been nice to see that the ball continues to live on in the memory of Tom Hanks, because they've been best friends.  But instead, he is forgotten.All in all, Cast away has an interesting story that contains two good actors and one (or two at the max) great scene(s).  This is simply insufficient to make a good film.  There are too many ups and downs and although they're equal in number, the downs are much stronger than the ups.

I always thought Tom Cruise got to the top thanks to his looks, but after watching IWTV I know this is not true; this guy is talented to the toes.

And he doesn't really reflect Lestat's remoteness, his loneliness and despair for a true lover and companion. Although I've read the Vampire Chronicles, I prefer the movie to it, as it breathes a very rare type of style; Neil Jordan's certainly outdone himself. Antonio Banderas did a perfect job as Armand. He's got this special vibe over him, earlier noticed in 'Philadelphia'. I enjoyed his appearance very much. Kirsten Dunst was the real surprise in the movie. Her eerily precocious character Claudia is perfectly played, only sometimes she read it out straight from the script, that was a pity.

In an age when filmmakers are afraid to make films that are actually about something. P.T. Anderson made a film that is about the most important thing simply living day to day with all the tragedies and frustrations that can happen in our lives. That he does it with an incredible energy and spirit and passion makes the film even more powerful.I got the feeling all throughout Magnolia that directory P.T. Anderson really loves his characters. As the camera moves over each of the characters, allowing us to see their lives, there's a constant feeling that we are seeing the characters souls laid bare on film. When we see Quiz Kid Donnie Smith in a bar ogling the bartender he loves, so much of the character is conveyed in one or two small gestures by actor William H. Macy. In five seconds Macy has conveyed the whole inner life of this character who we then see for three more hours. It's a spectacular moment in a film that is filled with spectacular moments. We seem to see Donnie Smith's soul in that moment. And the film is filled with scenes like that.This film is over three hours long, but every scene fits well in the movie. It's hard to imagine anything being cut, as every scene adds depth and feeling, not to mention the back story for each of the characters.

The decisions being made during those days in October, 1962 would have a profound effect on the lives of millions of people throughout the world. For the most part, THIRTEEN DAYS does an effective job of recreating the desperation felt by both the leaders and the citizens during this time of crisis.The events leading up to the stare-down between the US and the USSR have been well documented, so there is little new ground covered in this movie. The payoff for the audience is to watch the actors in their roles as world leaders, and to hopefully get a sense of the conflict not only among the different factions of the government, but also within the mind of each individual. Most of the performances are first rate. Bruce Greenwood, as President Kennedy, is impassioned without being hammy, no small accomplishment given the emotional nature of the situation.(One aside--was it just me or did Bruce Greenwood bear an uncanny resemblance to Dan Patrick of ESPN and Sportcenter fame? For me this was a bit disconcerting, since presidential is not one if the adjectives I would use to describe the entertaining Mr. Patrick.) Presidential Advisor Kenny O'Donnell is played with some restraint by Kevin Costner, who allowed the other members of the cast to carry their share of the load. His accent is somewhat overpowering and forced at the beginning of the movie, but either he toned it down later, or I became used to it. Either way, it stopped being a distraction. The best performance is turned in by Steven Culp, who was totally believable as Robert Kennedy. We see Robert as a tough, intelligent man thrust into an almost no win situation--he is expected to be the voice of reason and a guiding light while surrounded by dissenting opinions as to what is right. Steven Culp shows him as a man who accepts this responsibility because his country needs him to, even if he sometimes doubts his worthiness for the role.

But in spite of that little fiction, you still get to see the very clear message of this film.  The mistreatment of black people as a consequence of racial discrimination is disgraceful and typical KKK-behaviour.  In short this film puts the accent on the time when America was in war with itself.Most of the film really happened and that's the reason why the storyline is so good.  Besides the actual 'colour-crisis' in Mississippi, there's also a bit of fiction that should make the film less dramatic.  The story goes as follows When in 1964 three civil right-activists disappear from a little town called Mississippi, the FBI sends out two cops in order to investigate the case.  At first, they'll do more damage than good.  But when they decide to do things the hard way, there's finally some progress. One of the most depressing scenes in the film (besides the killing) is when all the Ku-Klux-Clan members have gathered around for a 'meeting'.  They're not wearing their idiotic Halloween costumes and are normally dressed &#150; so in a way they went undercover!  They bring their children along and as a result of that they become a part of this sect as well.  They're too young to realize what is wrong and right.  Children are naïve and easily influenced and that's why you can see in the film how they smile and cheer and how they really enjoy themselves on such meetings.  Beyond their own knowledge, they're sucked into the system.As said before this film contains a few interesting characters in order to make the film less dramatic.

They start the case nice and easy, but after many (black people's) deaths and burnt down houses, they switch over to the hard way.  Even the honest Willem Dafoe has to admit that this violent and remorseless way of working is more effective to their case.  Both actors do a great job.  Willem Dafoe was great in his previous film (Platoon), but in this film he is even better.  Even better is Gene Hackman.  He plays pretty much the same part as he did in The French connection.

Better to see it alone.However, with a like bunch gathered around the TV, or best yet- collected in a retro-theater at midnight- Young Frankenstein is incomparable. It's an excellent film that would be better without Gene Wilder's screaming. But that isn't irritating the first couple of times you watch and his performance more than compensates. The universal favorite scene is Gene Hackman's hermit host. Serious actors like Hackman are all the funnier in unexpected roles, and if I could write a horse whinney I would, as I mention Cloris Leachman as Frau Blucher.Madeline Kahn was the finest comedic actress of recent decades, and this was her film debut.  She is perfect. Marty Feldman, of the migrating hump and damned eyes, is my favorite character, but there are several to choose from. Kenneth Mars is wonderful as the Inspector with a good memory and bum arm.Young Frankenstein is not a film to see over and over. It is one to take out in anticipation of a long dark evening when a visit to Transylvania Station seems in order.

It displayed for the whole world to see that school,(high school, secondary school) could actually be hell. In my mind Sissy Spacek was born to play Carrie White. She encapsulated all the emotions and feelings so well, your heart couldn't help but go out to her. In my mind this is a horror, but not in the sense of Carrie White's telekinesis, but of life, and of the people in it. Those who just wanna push things that little bit too far, for some nondescript reason. The girls squealing for Carrie to plug it up when she gets her first period and has no idea what it is, and when they start throwing tampons at her, is alot more frightening than most of the episodes of Carrie's telekinesis,(with the exception of the 2 final incidents). Piper Laurie's excellent portrayal of the religiously fanatical Magaret White, her determination that Carrie is first dirty and polluted which eventually gives way to her belief that Carrie is evil, is disturbing viewing especially considering that at the crux of this all, Carrie is her child.   A WORD OF WARNING De Palma's version differs from Stephen Kings novel, however that does not make it bad, since the initial essence is there. Carrie is an unfortunate victim of circumstance, trapped in a world that she does not control, one thread that is evident in both the film and the novel is that Carrie's ultimate empowerment and her decision (arguably based on instinct and reaction)to initiate it, leads to destruction of the town and finally of herself, but throughout the whole thing she remains, unsure and often even unaware. Carrie is a victim you care about and you understand the revenge she exacts upon her classmates and the redeemed Sue Snell(Amy Irving), however, you get the feeling that Snell's attempts to bring Carrie happiness is slightly a case of trying to forgive herself for descending into madness in the girls locker room. The final scene (one of the best classic endings of a film everdiscuss!?) is a final triumph for Carrie, her final revenge, her gift to Sue Snell, her legacy. But throughout the whole film, never was this more a case of just an innocent victim of circumstance. A triumph for King and De Palma, (plus a chance for De Palma to home his skills down, in particular his trademark split screen filming). If any parent ever said life was easy for kids, sit them down and make them watch Carrie.

Why illegal?  Well, not more than a few years after Bram Stoker wrote this bestseller, a film was made of that book.  Only no one had ever asked his permission to do so.  But the author never had a court case, because it was a German film version with a different title and a slightly changed story.  But still, the main part of this film was exactly the same as in the book.  Simply anyone could see that Nosferatu, eine symphonie des grauens (as this was going to be the full name of the film) was an immediate adaptation of the book Dracula by Bram Stoker. Even so, Nosferatu is an exceptional piece of work and a true classic.  It's one of the best Dracula-films ever made.  It has meant a great deal to future horror films.  Even today this film has the same importance as when it came out in 1922.  Not so long ago, an unsuccessful adaptation of this film was released under the name `Shadow of the vampire' starring John Malkovich and Willem Dafoe.  Because the film is in colour, I don't give it much credit.  The original version is much, much better.Director F.W. Murnau proves in this film that the use of light in a film is simply indispensable since you can't have any shades or shadows without light.  In a great way, Murnau works with awe-inspiring shadows in order to demonstrate the power and magic of light.  These sinister silhouettes are great special effects and perfect for creating a dark and threatening atmosphere.  They are, of course, the silhouettes of the evil monster Nosferatu.  After all, he is the one who causes all the panic and fear.  In an excellent combination with this special light\/shadow-work, Murnau also uses very original camera shots alternated with fade-ins and fade-outs; that only appear once in a while. The music is very important in this film, as this is a silent film.  There's absolutely no talking involved and in order to break the silence, beautiful piano music is used in the film.  But the most important meaning of this music is not to entertain the viewer, but to ascertain the thrilling atmosphere of the film.  And that is why this piano music is (besides beautiful) both creepy and gripping. Overall the acting is good, but Max Schreck as the pale and skeletal vampire is unforgettable.  His fantastic performance has really made the difference to this film.  It might just be the greatest Dracula-related performance ever. You might not expect this from a thriller-horror classic of the early 20s, but sometimes this film is quite funny.  Of course, it is more black humour that we're talking about, as we are actually amused with other people's suffering. All things considered, this is a most important film that has had a lot of influence on all similar horror films that were still to follow an impressive picture that keeps on fascinating!

I mean, it's not like Tom Hanks was in it or Steven Spielberg directed it. But somehow, it ended up being just a great comedy.High Fidelity just had a really entertaining story, and it was extremely well acted by everyone involved. This is what I have come up with in my mission to find out what it was about High Fidelity that made me like it so much. Sure, there's not a whole lot to the story &#150; a guy gets dumped and goes back and recounts his relationships and break-ups with his top five girlfriends, but it was presented in such a clever way that it made bland material a lot of fun. One of the things that was really good about High Fidelity was the way the `top five girlfriends' premise was complemented by Rob Gordon (Cusack) and his music geek friends coming up with countless top five lists. Top five dream jobs, top five first songs on music albums, top five this, top five that. Anyone who is into top five lists or top ten lists will probably love High Fidelity just for that small part of it. Speaking of Gordon's music geek friends, the person who really stole the show was Jack Black, as Barry, one of Gordon's employees at the record store that he owns in the film. This is particularly notable given the variety of unenviable roles that Black has played, such as those in Cable Guy and, more recently, The Jackal. The hilarious music discussion scenes that take place in the record store are probably the best scenes in the film, and Black steals nearly every one of them. Almost as amusing as Black was Todd Louiso, playing the part of Dick, another employee at Gordon's record store. Dick is a very soft-spoken music fanatic who is probably so entertaining because we've known someone like him. In fact, that's what is so appealing about Gordon and Barry, too. They are a cross-section of music fans in the urban world and they provide many more laughs because of their familiarity.  A number of well-known actors also played relatively small roles in High Fidelity, such as Catherine Zeta-Jones, Natasha Gregson Wagner, Joan Cusack, and, of course, Tim Robbins as the antagonistic &#145;new boyfriend.' One of the really good things about High Fidelity is that it eventually delivers a good message about stepping up and actually doing something with your life. It warns of the dangers of getting too comfortable doing one thing, and of giving in to the temptation of hopping from relationship to brief relationship. At the end, Rob begins to realize the mistakes that he made in his relationship with Laura, and these are mistakes that I think a lot of people have made and continue to make. High Fidelity is just good comedy. It's fun, it's entertaining, and above all, it's refreshing because of it's relative originality. There are plenty of memorable scenes in the film, many because of their sheer, if illogical, hilarity.

There are plenty of memorable scenes in the film, many because of their sheer, if illogical, hilarity. Some of the customers who come into the record store are treated much worse than they would ever be treated in real life, but the laughs are delivered. Don't miss this one.

He has a rather enjoyable Vincent Price-like quality to his approach as the man with the real Golden Gun.  In spite of the fact that the solar energy plotline seems a bit thin and Herve' Villachaize gets somewhat annoying as Nick Nack, I still find this to be a little better than some Bond outings.  If you want one that really goes TOO FAR in every respect, catch my review of MOONRAKER.  This one isn't stellar, but it sure isn't the worst two hours I've spent in my life.Rating 7 out of 10.
