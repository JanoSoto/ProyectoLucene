Now, I just got done watching it for the 2nd straight night in a row.  How anyone can say that this movie is overrated is beyond me; it is almost like they want to say that to be different!The acting is outstanding by everyone involved including Robbins, Freeman, Sadler, Gunton, Brown, etc.  Maybe the most chilling scene is when Tommy reveals to Red and Andy about how he had a cellmate at another prison reveal to him about that time he killed that golf pro and that b*tch he was knocking up.  There was something about that scene in how Darabont filmed it with the lighting and the laugh of that guy.  It left an impression on me.  It also was the turning point of the movie, although you could tell from the very beginning that Andy was not like any other convict.One thing that sorta bothered me was near the end when it was revealed to the press about all the stuff going on at Shawshank, how it was so quick for Norton, Hadley, etc. to get theirs.  I mean how did Andy really accomplish this without giving himself away and how did they not trace his whereabouts or question him?  Oh well, I guess wondering about one thing like that is not too bad.  Normally, there are like 5 things or more that I wonder about in every movie, but that is why it is a movie, I guess.At any rate, don't let the above paragraph ruin it for you...I'm just a weirdo after all...)  The music, camera angles, lighting, acting, etc. are all outstanding.This is a movie that needs to be watched over and over again and should be treasured.  There is a reason for it being ranked #2 all-time, people. It's that good.  If you wind up enjoying this movie, I recommend another Darabond movie based on a Stephen King work in The Green Mile.  It is a little-bit more fantasy than Shawshank but it is an outstanding movie.

Having grown up with He-Man, I watched the film with hope, but, despite not having seen the cartoon for a number of years before I watched this on VHS, I still spotted the gaping holes. No Battle-Cat, no Orko (not that I really missed him - never liked Orko) and since when was He-Man permanently He-Man? What happened to Adam?Dolph Lundgren's He-Man was just perfect as far as physical resemblance goes. Just like Arnie in the Conan movies, you had no trouble believing he was the main character. But unlike Arnie, whose acting weaknesses actually came across as social ineptitude on Conan's part and enhanced the image, Dolph's acting and accent ruined any credulity he had as He-Man.Despite being set on Earth (no budget for Eternia, apparently) the film is saved primarily by James Tolkan's character, Det. Lubic, a cop with an attitude. I ended up watching it more for him than anything else. Basically it's the same character he played in Back to the Future.Billy Barty reprises his village wizard role from Willow here, albeit with more make-up.Interesting to see Robert Duncan McNeill here. He later went on to play Tom Paris in the Voyager series.Apart from the unforgiveable liberties taken with the source material (at least it's not as bad as Dungeons and Dragons!) the film's biggest letdown was Skeletor. Oh. Frank Langella plays the part well enough, but I'm referring to the rubber skull mask he wore. It was just so lame and obvious. And since when did Skeletor have eyeballs anyhow?A pretty poor movie overall and something only the youngest fans will enjoy due to the extreme low budget and lack of understanding of the materiel on the part of the producers, writers and director.
