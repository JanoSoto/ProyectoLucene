The story is about a frustrated teen (Josh Hartnett) who plays basketball with a star athlete,O (Mehki Phieffer) who's got everything, his entering in college basketball and the most popular girl in highschool, starts a plan to ruin O's life. Everything suddenly starts happening bad for O's life and everything then crumbles. The movie was very fascinating and everything in the film didn't make you bored because everything was stimulating and fast paced. There was some flaws in acting but it was still alright.

While Romero went to continue the narrative with Dawn and Day of the Dead, both bleak social satire\/horrors, Russo undertook a humorous and far more chaotic reprise of the original story.Writer\/director Dan O' Bannon pulls out all the stops for a gut-busting entertainer. The story begins with a bang and from then on moves at a dizzying pace piled on by the minute with increasingly outrageous events. From a strip tease in a graveyard to a massive showdown between the zombies and the law, and a way-over-the-top climax, this movie is a pinnacle of pitch-black zany humor.Unlike Romero's zombies the ones in RoTLD move fast and can speak (they use police radios, like a takeout service, to call for more reinforcements). Head shots don't do them in any more, since even their severed body parts can move and grasp at prey. Thankfully they're not just good make-up effects, but also have distinct personalities that add tremendously to the film's fun value.The film is chock-full of good humor and tongue-in-cheek genre touches (like the graveyard being named as 'Resurrection Cemetry'). The people behind this movie seemed to have had a great time making it and I sure had a great time watching this one. If you have any liking for the horror genre, you owe it to yourself to get this one and keep a big box of popcorn handy.

Yes it is a long film; a very long film. Perhaps this is a symptom of the short attention spans of people today. But you know what? I wish it was 3 or 4 times longer. Every time this film finishes I compare it to the badly acted special effects laden rubbish that passes for 'epic' cinema these days and wish that T.E Lawrence had his motorcycle accident at 93 (rather than 47 as he did in 1935) so I could have had more of Peter O' Toole's electrifying performance.The cinematography is acknowledged as being some of the the best in any film ever. When Mr Lean wanted to capture a sun rise, he stood in the dark (in a REAL desert) and waited for the sun to REALLY rise (No computerized nonsense in this film). As for the reviewer who thought Lawrence looked like a homosexual because he had a 'effeminate' walk, well ... I can only hope that one day he joins the 21st century; hero's aren't all musclebound apes, leaders aren't all fluffy paragons of virtue, and so what if he did turn out to be homosexual?If you and you dad like watching a man being whipped before being violated there is, I believe, a wealth of material available to cater for your taste at your local pornography shop.In my opinion its one of the best films ever made and certainly the best film I've seen based on real events.Forget the length feel the quality.
