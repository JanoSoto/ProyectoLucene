To say that The Man Who Wasn't There is the first stinker to bear the Coen brothers name is questionable.  A lot of people didn't care for Hudsucker Proxy, but it's a lot funnier and a lot more endearing than TMWWT.  The Coens are misunderstood.  First of all their name is pronounced Cone not Co-hen, seeing as though they're Irish and not Jewish.  That's not such a big deal.  The fact that critics championed this film as post-noir is somewhat laughable.  Like in the aforementioned HUDSUCKER, the Bros. Co-hinn's attempt to emulate an arcane cinematechnique results in an unintentional parody of the genre.  While they can produce really good post-noir like Blood Simple and Fargo, TMWWT shows that they may be taking themselves a little too seriously.  First of all, the plot relies on a seemingly endless series of unfeasible coincidences.  The film itself relies on the viewer to take some pity on Billy Bob Thorton's Barber - an apologetic, monotonous, boring loser whose flirtatious wife, Frances McDormand, is perpetually having an affair.  This is impossible because the character is difficult to understand.  Thorton's performance makes this even more difficult, since he's so boring.  He can't be funny - when he tries to be funny it's sad, and vice versa.  Frances McDormand's character, who always seems to be drunk, is involved with Tony Soprano.  Tony Soprano's wife is, apparently, insane.  Now you know how it goes from here somebody who's involved in something does something to somebody who's involved with someone who's involved in something somehow relate to the something that someone is doing to someone, and then, the end.  Unfortunatley, after all the film-noir parody - yes, film noir parody - is over and done with, there's a tacked on plot with Ms. Lost in Translation in what i would call an unfortunate performance in the sense that she's too modern and too arrogant to be featured in a period piece.  Thorton thinks she has a chance of making it, so he emotionally invests himself in ensuring a better life for this girl who wow's him with her ability to note read Beethoven.  The courtroom scenes are the height of tedium.  Calling this dramedy is a laugh. If you believe the lines he said I was modern man are anything other than comedy, you're sadly mistaken.  The plot twists and turns so much - it doesn't make sense, and it isn't entertaining.  The acting is bad, it's too long, it doesn't work as a comedy.  Film noir is just about dark subject matter - sometimes the plots twist a lot, and spellbinds and creates more tension and mystery and confusion - that's what makes it great.  Then finally, everything is explained at the end.  This is the most unapologetically inarticulate of their genre-parodies.  It isn't nearly a comment.  It's a plea to a sedate audience that film noir plots should be lampooned for their dense, multi-faceted layers - more films like this should be made!  Nothing is sacred anymore!  The fact that some movies rely on many stories distilled and jam-packed together into two and 1\/2 hours is funny!  If this was a straight comedy, it would've worked.  It ain't and it don't.

I'm not in particular a fan of Steven Seagal, though I don't arbitrarily hate him like many critics do. In fact, this was the first of his movies I'd seen, and I liked it immediately.For any people expecting this movie to deviate from the usual formula of (1) Seagal is wronged, (2) Seagal becomes killing machine, you'll be disappointed. Almost everything in this movie is to be expected, as Seagal plays his usual tough but lovable good guy who gets pushed just a bit too far and goes into full-on expert martial arts killer to enact revenge. A dozen or so people will die, as many or more limbs will be broken, and Seagal will do it all with as much emotion as a stick. To those expecting more of Seagal's usual stuff, that's what you'll get.But in my opinion, what we also get are some inexplicably high level bad guys for this outing. Although about a decade or two behind today's times (keeping in mind the film itself is a decade and a half old), the two antagonists are the well known actors Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey. While getting on in their age nowadays, these two were some of the most crazed and entertaining actors of the 70s and 80s. Jones is probably best known from The Fugitive, for which he won an academy award, while Gary Busey has done a boatload of famous, not-so famous, and video game voiceover work. Together, these veterans almost steal the show as they chew the scenery and provide Seagal's most colorful and charismatic characters. Busey is a former ship's commander who's willing to drown his crew simply to taunt Seagal, whereas Jones' character used to send body parts to his ex-bosses at the CIA before turning up here.The plot of this movie is that the two aforementioned crazies, with an entire crew of inside tech guys and hired muscle, have overtaken the aircraft carrier USS Missouri, with plans to extort various things from the big guys in Washington with the ship's small but capable arsenal of weapons at their disposal. The catch is that a high-ranking ex-navy seal is on the ship, serving a commuted sentence for misbehavior. Stuck here as the ship's cook, Seagal plays Casey Ryback who must do whatever he can to rally the ship back into responsible hands.Strangely enough, the movie departs in several ways from the regular formula. The aforementioned bad guys are not only one head honcho but two equally ambitious ones, as well as a capable force of a dozen or so armed men. But where one would expect Seagal to be alone, this time the film adds at least a little credibility to the mix Seagal still raises hell, but he also has to get the help of several others stowed on the ship if he's to have any chance in operating its guns and other functions. In a film rooted in implausability, it's at least nice to see old Steve actually running around with some admitted help.The pace is interesting, as the early scenes in the movie set up some beautiful shots of the ship as well as some of its intricate interiors and set pieces. Some characters are the token one-line kills, but then there are some side characters who are given their own personality and a scene or two to take advantage of. Many characters from the aforementioned Fugitive (1993) make returns in this movie, as well as a decent character played by Colm Meaney, who was Miles 'O Brien to Star Trek fans.Probably the only annoying bit of this movie is the female lead, played by Playboy model Erika Eleniak. She does a serviceable job, shows her breasts for a minute like she's expected to, and sometimes comes across as a believable person. But for the most part, she's there to lend support to Seagal, and add a little comic repartee between them. I didn't really mind her until she had a silly turn as hero(ine) for a minute or two.But that's a minor quibble, in a film that I still love as being Seagal's most tight, interesting and energetic. It somehow seems more well written or polished than all his other efforts, and this is no doubt aided by the considerable time that is spent establishing the villains, who I've already noted as being the best Seagal's had to tackle.

Mr Moonlighting's career had been in long, slow decline apart from the blip-boost of his Pulp Fiction cameo, but 'The Sixth Sense' put him back in the big league, temporarily at least.For many of us seduced by the hype of TSS, and especially the write-up for its emerging writing talent - the exotically named 'M Night Shyamalan' actually sitting and watching the movie was a bit of an anticlimax. Fairly leaden performances, portentous script and a fairly hackeneyed and well trailed twist at the end.However it seemed to seal M Night's reputation as a screenwriter of note, I guess based on box office alone, a reputation his two subsequent films have not borne out. But where Unbreakable was merely dull, Signs is basically appalling.The idea has taken shape that this guy is a genius and up to handling the challenge of being director, writer and producer of a single project. He acquits none of these well in Signs. Despite having two of the great action-event movie producers riding shotgun; Marshall\/Kennedy, Signs is so unbelievably leaden for the first hour-and-a-half that my finger hovered tantalisingly over the stop button.Most infuriating is the artifical and non-naturalistic 'style' that someone (I suspect M. Night) has directed the actors to use. This combines an utter lack of emotional range with non-normal response to situations, interspered with sickly outpourings of inner belief or the characters acting as mouthpieces for cod philosophy.Two horrendous moments spring to mind in the film the first, where Gibson and Phoenix sit watching television coverage of the alien encounters, Gibson launches it a 'there are two types of people speech'. This rambling, inelegant and absolutely unprofound observation of whether people have faith or not to see them through is treated as a brimming eyed revelation by Phoenix's character while the audience thinks 'huh?'.What is even more cringeworthy is that you can feel that the writer thinks - wow this is really great writing. This is so far above the crappy naturalistic speech of most Hollywood movies. No, it's not it's turgid, badly written, inconsistent and vacuous pandering to your fanbase and the constructed image of yourself as a 'great writer'.The second occasion is the 'when your were born' speeches that Gibson regales his children with as the aliens are breaking into the house with the intention of eating everyone for breakfast. Pointless, artifical 'moments' of profundity when any honest and naturalistic attempt to capture that moment, that emotion would get its true fear and horror.Actually, let me change my mind. The most truly awful moment of this film is when Gibson gets to exchange some final words with his wife who happens to have been cut in half by a car but is still totally aware and communicative seconds before slipping softly into death. This is not how people die, let alone how they live.It needs not me to add to the chorus of derision about the basic plot of the film and its alien invasion theme. It's not so much as picking holes in the plot as attempting to create something coherent and logical out of it. Naked aliens that cannot stand WATER? Better sack the alien commander responsible for researching the invasion then. The idea that they might travel 500 million light years to be defeated by a garden hose is totally risible.Of course M Night devotees will say the story is actually a PARABLE which mundane viewers expecting a story and real characters are missing. The water can be viewed as baptismal, the aliens as our internal demons, the house as the isolation of the soul, the whole event as a proof of faith. Yawn. There is more insight into the human condition in 5 minutes of Scorsese or Alan Parker than in hours of this simulated, meretricious garbage which is intended to appeal to our vague spiritual yearnings and need for pasteurised morality.

","genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"5 March 2004","score":"","review":"  One of the most unfortunate films events of recent years was the unexpected success of a little-trailed Bruce Willis ghost story movie. Mr Moonlighting's career had been in long, slow decline apart from the blip-boost of his Pulp Fiction cameo, but 'The Sixth Sense' put him back in the big league, temporarily at least.For many of us seduced by the hype of TSS, and especially the write-up for its emerging writing talent - the exotically named 'M Night Shyamalan' actually sitting and watching the movie was a bit of an anticlimax. Fairly leaden performances, portentous script and a fairly hackeneyed and well trailed twist at the end.However it seemed to seal M Night's reputation as a screenwriter of note, I guess based on box office alone, a reputation his two subsequent films have not borne out. But where Unbreakable was merely dull, Signs is basically appalling.The idea has taken shape that this guy is a genius and up to handling the challenge of being director, writer and producer of a single project. He acquits none of these well in Signs. Despite having two of the great action-event movie producers riding shotgun; Marshall\/Kennedy, Signs is so unbelievably leaden for the first hour-and-a-half that my finger hovered tantalisingly over the stop button.Most infuriating is the artifical and non-naturalistic 'style' that someone (I suspect M. Night) has directed the actors to use. This combines an utter lack of emotional range with non-normal response to situations, interspered with sickly outpourings of inner belief or the characters acting as mouthpieces for cod philosophy.Two horrendous moments spring to mind in the film the first, where Gibson and Phoenix sit watching television coverage of the alien encounters, Gibson launches it a 'there are two types of people speech'. This rambling, inelegant and absolutely unprofound observation of whether people have faith or not to see them through is treated as a brimming eyed revelation by Phoenix's character while the audience thinks 'huh?'.What is even more cringeworthy is that you can feel that the writer thinks - wow this is really great writing.

Most of these were very good, but Planes, Trains & Automobiles was a nice change of pace. The pairing up of Steve Martin and John Candy was an inspired choice, and these two great actors turn the film into a comedy masterpiece.Normally, I can't stand Steve Martin, because in almost everything I've seen him in, he goes completely over the top. But his performance in PTA changed my outlook of him. He plays Neal Page, a snobbish, cynical advertising executive in New York, who is going home to Chicago for Thanksgiving. The film is called Planes, Trains & Automobiles because these are the means of transportation Neal has to go through to get home.Desperately late for his plane home, there is an hilarious scene at the beginning where he makes a mad dash for a taxi with Kevin Bacon (making a cameo). Unfortunately, Neal loses out, and then loses a second taxi stolen by John Candy. He plays Del Griffith, a shower curtain ring salesman, who is also on his way to the airport.The two of them properly meet at the airport after Neal's flight is delayed. I like this scene because they both recognise each other from somewhere, but can't quite place where. Neal then has the bad luck of being seated next to Del on the plane. At some point in our lives, we've all met someone like Del Griffith. Someone who is over friendly, chatty, and a real pest. But they're so full of the best of intentions you don't have the heart to tell them to leave you alone.Just when it looks like things can't get any worse for Neal, the flight is then cancelled. So begins the hysterical chain of events of Neal's odyssey to get home.Now stuck with Del, who wants to help Neal, our hapless duo go from one disaster after another to get to Chicago. Steve Martin and John Candy make a great double act, because although they seem like the archetypal Odd Couple, there are more complexities to their relationship then at first thought.One of the best scenes is when they are forced to spend a night in a motel. Del's slobbish behaviour finally drives Neal to explode. He begins ranting about how boring Del is, and what a real failure he is. In short, Del is nothing but a plague on humanity.What is so good about this scene, is at first you are chuckling at Neal pointing out Del's shortcomings. But Del looks so genuinely hurt your sympathies start to switch to Del instead of Neal. Then something very unexpected happens, when Del tells Neal (and the audience) something I thought was very movingYou wanna hurt me? Go right ahead if it makes you feel any better. I'm an easy target. Yeah you're right. I talk too much. I also listen too much. I could be a cold hearted cynic like you... but I don't like to hurt people's feelings. You can say what you like about me; I'm not changing. Me... I like me. My wife likes me. My customers like me. 'Cause I'm the real article. What you see is what you get.This scene alone speaks volumes about the personalities of these two men. You begin to really feel sorry for Del, because he seems like a lonely man. And Neal is not such a nice person after all. He doesn't mind insulting people if it makes him feel better. But still, the laughs come thick and fast afterwards. One of the most hysterical scenes is when Neal mouths off at a car rental saleswoman after being dumped in the middle of nowhere. I've never heard so many F words in one sentence. This had to have been what gave the film its 15 certificate. Its possible Hughes inserted this scene to make it clearer to the audience PTA is more adult-oriented than his previous films.Del and Neal end up sharing a rental car, and they manage to completely wreck it. They are nearly killed by two trucks, and the funniest part is when Del appears as the Devil to Neal. Everything just seems to be conspiring against them. Gradually, the two men start to become friends. What's satisfying is it doesn't feel artificial. It feels like its been building up to it. This is due to John Hughes' slick direction. Neal and Del are two men who are both social misfits for different reasons. Neal is too organised and structured to relate to others, and Del tries so hard to make friends he often ends up alienating them.Despite all the disasters that befall them, they do make it to Chicago. This is where the film takes on a more serious tone, but doesn't lessen the enjoyment. Del has a secret he hasn't told Neal concerning his wife, but I won't reveal it for those who haven't seen the film.The ending is very touching, and a little sad too. But you have grown to like both Neal and Del by the end of the film. Both of them realise things about themselves. Neal learns to be more tolerant and kind, and Del learns not to be so overbearing with his friendliness. The film ends with where their friendship will lead to, and its probably best left that way.Its a pity Steve Martin and John Candy couldn't have made more films, because they worked so well together. This is my favourite Steve Martin film, and it never seems mawkish or cloying in any way. A great little study into the personality changes you can go through on the road. I always notice something different to this film every time I watch it. This was the best film John Candy ever made. There is so much of him in Del. R.I.P. John Candy.

One of the most hysterical scenes is when Neal mouths off at a car rental saleswoman after being dumped in the middle of nowhere. I've never heard so many F words in one sentence. This had to have been what gave the film its 15 certificate. Its possible Hughes inserted this scene to make it clearer to the audience PTA is more adult-oriented than his previous films.Del and Neal end up sharing a rental car, and they manage to completely wreck it. They are nearly killed by two trucks, and the funniest part is when Del appears as the Devil to Neal. Everything just seems to be conspiring against them. Gradually, the two men start to become friends. What's satisfying is it doesn't feel artificial. It feels like its been building up to it. This is due to John Hughes' slick direction. Neal and Del are two men who are both social misfits for different reasons. Neal is too organised and structured to relate to others, and Del tries so hard to make friends he often ends up alienating them.Despite all the disasters that befall them, they do make it to Chicago. This is where the film takes on a more serious tone, but doesn't lessen the enjoyment. Del has a secret he hasn't told Neal concerning his wife, but I won't reveal it for those who haven't seen the film.The ending is very touching, and a little sad too. But you have grown to like both Neal and Del by the end of the film. Both of them realise things about themselves. Neal learns to be more tolerant and kind, and Del learns not to be so overbearing with his friendliness. The film ends with where their friendship will lead to, and its probably best left that way.Its a pity Steve Martin and John Candy couldn't have made more films, because they worked so well together. This is my favourite Steve Martin film, and it never seems mawkish or cloying in any way. A great little study into the personality changes you can go through on the road. I always notice something different to this film every time I watch it. This was the best film John Candy ever made. There is so much of him in Del. R.I.P. John Candy. ","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"5 March 2004","score":"10 out of 12 people found the following review useful","review":" John Hughes normally concentrated on teen films in the 1980's. Most of these were very good, but Planes, Trains & Automobiles was a nice change of pace. The pairing up of Steve Martin and John Candy was an inspired choice, and these two great actors turn the film into a comedy masterpiece.Normally, I can't stand Steve Martin, because in almost everything I've seen him in, he goes completely over the top. But his performance in PTA changed my outlook of him. He plays Neal Page, a snobbish, cynical advertising executive in New York, who is going home to Chicago for Thanksgiving. The film is called Planes, Trains & Automobiles because these are the means of transportation Neal has to go through to get home.Desperately late for his plane home, there is an hilarious scene at the beginning where he makes a mad dash for a taxi with Kevin Bacon (making a cameo). Unfortunately, Neal loses out, and then loses a second taxi stolen by John Candy. He plays Del Griffith, a shower curtain ring salesman, who is also on his way to the airport.The two of them properly meet at the airport after Neal's flight is delayed. I like this scene because they both recognise each other from somewhere, but can't quite place where. Neal then has the bad luck of being seated next to Del on the plane. At some point in our lives, we've all met someone like Del Griffith. Someone who is over friendly, chatty, and a real pest. But they're so full of the best of intentions you don't have the heart to tell them to leave you alone.Just when it looks like things can't get any worse for Neal, the flight is then cancelled. So begins the hysterical chain of events of Neal's odyssey to get home.Now stuck with Del, who wants to help Neal, our hapless duo go from one disaster after another to get to Chicago. Steve Martin and John Candy make a great double act, because although they seem like the archetypal Odd Couple, there are more complexities to their relationship then at first thought.One of the best scenes is when they are forced to spend a night in a motel. Del's slobbish behaviour finally drives Neal to explode. He begins ranting about how boring Del is, and what a real failure he is. In short, Del is nothing but a plague on humanity.What is so good about this scene, is at first you are chuckling at Neal pointing out Del's shortcomings. But Del looks so genuinely hurt your sympathies start to switch to Del instead of Neal. Then something very unexpected happens, when Del tells Neal (and the audience) something I thought was very movingYou wanna hurt me? Go right ahead if it makes you feel any better. I'm an easy target. Yeah you're right. I talk too much. I also listen too much. I could be a cold hearted cynic like you... but I don't like to hurt people's feelings. You can say what you like about me; I'm not changing. Me... I like me. My wife likes me. My customers like me. 'Cause I'm the real article. What you see is what you get.This scene alone speaks volumes about the personalities of these two men. You begin to really feel sorry for Del, because he seems like a lonely man.

He's an important film-maker whose work refuses to let us forget our past or ignore the present it's created.  His career has been devoted to asking questions no one wants to answer, and such courage &#150; rare in Hollywood - is something to value.  What frustrates me is that his films rarely live up to the ideas behind them, and Bamboozled is no exception.It presents his most interesting idea and biggest disappointment to date.  Harvard-educated screenwriter Pierre Delacroix (Damon Wayans) is frustrated.  The sole black writer at his network, his ideas for shows featuring the black middle class are rejected one after the other.  His white station manager wants something more real &#150; real meaning poor, undereducated and armed, the kind of `real' we see in gangsta rap videos.  In reply, Delacroix creates The New Millennium Minstrel Show, a black-face variety show that will fail so badly and outrage so many he'll be freed from his contract.  Hosted by Mantan and Sleep &#145;n' Eat, the show is set in a plantation&#145;s watermelon patch, filled with sketches where the duo steal chickens from their overseer's coop.  The pilot is a hit and suddenly Delacroix finds his creation out of his control.Bamboozled was a hard film to finance and its struggle points to its importance, but despite its wealth of ideas the execution is poor and reeks of an opportunity missed.  Much of its failure comes from the central performance by Wayans, a frankly bizarre turn that irritates from the first word.  His Delacroix, uncomfortable in his skin, has changed his name and much of his accent.  What remains is an impression of an upper-class white man which is just that &#150; an impression.  It's a superficial performance, a pantomime out of place among the more subtle performances that surround it.  I appreciate its point, that Delacroix is ashamed of his origins, but it misses the target and does nothing but grate.Beyond that, Bamboozled is underwritten and feels under-rehearsed.  The character development is sloppy, huge changes in personality coming without warning and with little credibility.  Add to that a clichéd friendship-not-surviving-success subplot and big ideas apparently lifted from The Producers and Network, and there seems little left to praise.But while it fails on many levels, the good ideas remain and allow Lee to explore two main themes &#150; the past degradation of black performers and the position they hold today.  We learn that black artists in minstrel shows or movies had little choice but to degrade themselves if they wished to pursue a career in entertainment.  They were only allowed to be greedy, lazy, bug-eyed buffoons, stripped of their dignity so white audiences could enjoy them without addressing their prejudices.  Willie Best, an actor from the 1930s who himself performed under the name Sleep &#145;n' Eat once asked 'What's an actor going to do?  Either you do it or get out.Addressing the status of today's black performers in a number of interviews, Lee has accused gangsta rap of being `the 21st century minstrel show'.  It's an interesting argument, seeing that its lyrics and videos give overwhelmingly negative images of contemporary black culture that are lapped up by young white audiences.  Theft, drug use and abuse, violence against women, murder as entertainment; these are the means by which the rappers degrade themselves for their listeners.  The Mau-Maus, the gangsta rappers in the film who take issue with the New Millennium Minstrel Show represent these ideas, though how well they do so is questionable.  On the subject of blacks in film, Lee has condemned the use of `Super Magical Niggers' in the likes of The Green Mile and The Legend of Bagger Vance, men who `use magic to help white people but can't help themselves.'  Hollywood is still limiting the kinds of black films they'll make, choosing mostly gangsta, hip-hop shoot-em-ups or lowbrow comedy.  The same is true of TV, where `about 95% of blacks on television now are working on sit-coms.'  Where are the all-black dramas?  With gangsta rap, the dominance of lowbrow comedy on TV, and simplified fairytale roles or drug-centred grit in cinema, it seems that black entertainment in the white world still relies on degradation, stereotype or cheap laughs.  And although much of Lee's argument can be countered by a number of positive roles or by seeing gangsta rap as only a small part of the black music that dominates the charts, these are the things Bamboozled wants to make us think about.  Unfortunately, Lee's interviews that publicised the films are far more interesting, persuasive and thoughtful than the film itself.Perhaps that's the problem.  He's an interesting thinker but seems to have difficulty in wrapping his arguments around plot, pace and character.  The finest moments in Bamboozled come when he's not weighed down by those burdens.  The last few minutes feature a fantastic montage of film and TV's shameful past.  We see the obvious clips from Birth of a Nation and The Jazz Singer but are surprised to see Judy Garland, Mickey Rooney and Bing Crosby applying blackface.  When these films are shown on US television these moments are edited out &#150; Lee even came across a cartoon of Bugs Bunny in blackface that Warner Brothers wouldn't allow him to include.  The end credits house an equally shocking montage of racist memorabilia such as `The Hungry Nigger Bank' from Lee's own collection.  Had Bamboozled boasted that intensity throughout, had it not been let down by a script that fails to make its points, by Damon Wayan's superficial take on the lead role, and its betrayal of supporting characters for its finale, it would have been a fascinating film.  As it is, the message is powerful; the film is not.But when his films work and when they don't, Spike Lee is at least consistent in one thing; he makes you think long after the credits have rolled.

In fact, it is the study of these dichotomies, these human conditions that make this thriller timeless and allow it to be considered a true classic.Each of us has human fallibilities.  It is the struggle between the perfectibility of man and the imperfection of the human condition that creates the traps that Norman Bates speaks of.  In the foretelling rendezvous in the office parlor, Marion and Norman focus on the human condition and how we each weave our own tangled webs.  In this scene, Hitchcock clearly shows the fragile female, using sinister lighting and superior camera angles to make her appear vulnerable and susceptible.  Hitchcock pits her against the male on the prowl who is conflicted with his own demons and trapped, seemingly, by a traveler's hotel that gets no travelers.  Marion is uncomfortable, alone, and on the run straight into a trap of her own making; Norman is uncomfortable, alone, and trapped on what may as well be a dead-end road.  Norman is more than a hotelier; he is clearly the nervous suitor, fetching homemade sandwiches to feed the lovely visitor.  Marion is registered under a false name, believing that the police will catch her at any moment.

So if you want action, then this is a better choice.Basically; you can't call yourself a western fan if you haven't seen this one.10\/10 ","genre":"Western"},{"date":"5 March 2004","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  This one was the first movie I saw by my now favorite director Sergio Leone. It's one of those films you'll remember forever.Eli Wallach is simply astounding as Tuco, a character which you both love and hate. Eastwood is in his prime as the avenger and Van Cleef gives one of the chilliest performances in western movies as Sentenza.Morricone did some of his finest work on this very movie. The main tune is one that sticks in your brain like a tar-drenched dart. It's almost impossible not to whistle it after seeing the movie.The camera work by Tonino Delli Colli is a treat for the eye. From the high mountains to the railways. Everything oozes hot, sweaty western atmosphere (though it's filmed in Spain.The gunfights are really impressive. And there's lots of them too.

It is easily the best opening of any Bond film I have ever seen. Bond escapes from a Bank in Spain, goes on a wild and crazy boat ride through the Thames River(chasing a villain of course), and then hangs from a hot air baloon and falls. Then comes the theme song. My words may not make it sound exciting but it cannot be described, it must be seen. If you saw it on the big screen like I did, than you experienced something awesome. The theme song, which I think is one of the best, only adds to the greatness. So how does the rest of the film hold up? It holds up well but its not quite brilliant. Yes, the rest of the action scenes are (for the most part) expertly executed. I was also entertained from start to finish. However, the film is a bit uneven too. For the most part, the score was excellent. However, there were times when the score sounded like soap opera music(especially during the sex scene between Bond and Elektra). Also, the final action scene was disappointing. Bond getting away was the only satisfaction. Pierce Brosnan is in top form. He was a little rough around the edges in Goldeneye but those disappeared in Tomorrow Never Dies and there not in evidence here either. He is the 2nd best Bond(behind only Sean Connery). Sophie Marceau is completely belieable as Elektra. Denise Richards is not as successful. She is not a good actress and her performance is terrible. Robert Carlyle is effective as the villain, but he will not go down as one of the most memorable Bond films. Robbie Coltrane is delightful as Zukovsky.The World is Not Enough does not add up to a brilliant Bond Film but it is an accomplished one in its own right. It is worth seeing if only for the opening scene. It may not be on the same level as From Russia with Love and Goldfinger, but there is no doubt that it is a worthwhile Bond film.

Of course if there is a reason to respect this film its because of the mostly Native cast who make it worth watching.

As a matter of fact I think that even Johnny Depp is part Native as well (I think but I'm not sure on that).  But............ anyways.............. I think the main point to this film is that it was good to see Johnny Depp do some major soul searching like he did after he discovered that the job that he wanted was taken by someone else.  He travelled all that way by train only to find out that the person who was supposed to interview him wasn't even there to start.  As a result, someone else had to tell him that the position he sought was already filled.However........ anyways.............. this is why I gave this film a 4 out of 10.

The street car minus the driver has built up so much speed that the brakes won't work so Murphy jumps acroos to land in his cop car to steer it in front of the moving street car to stop it that way -- showing how both cops are willing to risk their own lives using the car as a brake. Of course the street car comes to a halt JUST before the street car comes to the end of its line, where it would have taken out a crowd of people who just scream, refusing to move -- so yeah unconvincing but fun.I believe this is one of Eddie Murphy's strongest performances ever but unfortunately he's in a movie that albeit very good, screams made-for-TV.
