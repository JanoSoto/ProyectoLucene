And just last night, for the first time also, I watched another Mexican film dealing with a man who has a decided thirst for blood, Guillermo del Toro's first film as a director, 1993's Cronos. This latter picture, however, coming 35 years after the other, is anything BUT a traditional vampire tale, and reveals del Toro to be a masterful filmmaker, and a consummate craftsman. Both written and directed by del Toro, Cronos must be added to the list of such Great First Horror Films By A Novice Director as Mario Bava's Black Sunday, George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead and Dario Argento's The Bird With the Crystal Plumage; it may not be as seminal a film as any of those earlier three, but it yet bursts with the same manifest imaginative glee and sheer joy of filmmaking; the work of a first-time director anxious to show the world what he is capable of, and succeeding wildly.Unlike the American sci-fi film Kronos (1957), which told of an energy-draining alien contraption, Cronos tells of a gizmo of a very different nature. In the picture's ubercreepy and fascinating intro, the viewer learns that the Cronos device was constructed by a Spanish alchemist, Uberto Fulcanelli, in 1536; a golden, scarab-shaped construction containing moving gears and a living insect, the device can sprout spiderlike appendages and insert a stinger into its owner, conferring the gift of eternal life. Flash forward 450 years or so, and we meet a kindly, aging antique-store owner, Jesus Gris (Gray Jesus, in other words, and played by Argentinean actor Federico Luppi, who would go on to appear in the del Toro films The Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth), who lives with his wife Mercedes (Margarita Isabel) and his strange little granddaughter, Aurora (the remarkable child actress Tamara Shanath). Jesus' antique shop is very much an upscale one--not at all like the Temptations Ltd. emporium that Peter Cushing presides over in 1973's From Beyond the Grave, to say the least--and, to be succinct, he one day discovers the ancient Cronos device hidden in the base of an archangel statue. Jesus is very quickly affected by the gizmo and is soon afflicted with a taste for blood. Meanwhile, his already tough predicament worsens when thuggish goon Angel (Ron Perlman, who himself would go on to appear in the del Toro films Blade 2, Hellboy and its sequel), emissary and nephew of dying millionaire De la Guardia (Claudio Brook), starts to get decidedly violent in his own search for the Cronos device....Strangely enough, the film that Cronos most brought to mind, as I watched it, was none other than the 1973 American film Ganja and Hess. In both pictures, a decent man is pierced by an ancient artifact (the dagger of Myrthia, in the earlier film) and becomes a vampire of sorts, although the V word is never mentioned in either film; in both films, our transformed man (Night of the Living Dead's Duane Jones, in the earlier picture) is shown daintily and disgustingly lapping up blood off of a floor! But that is pretty much where the similarity ends, and while Ganja and Hess is painfully slow moving and even managed the near-impossible task of putting me to sleep (the only film to ever accomplish this!), Cronos is at once compact, fast moving, suspenseful, colorful and exciting. It is also filled with all sorts of imaginative and oddball touches, such as Angel's nose fetish, a side trip to a very strange mortician's workshop, and those jars of (his very own) preserved organs that De la Guardia keeps on display. And speaking of oddball, the Aurora character is a very strange one indeed, a nearly mute little girl (I believe she speaks but a single word during the course of the entire film) whose unwavering love of and support for her grandfather--despite the horrible transformations he undergoes--are very much the sweet soul of this ultimately touching film. We care not a whit for the two central characters of Ganja and Hess, but get very much emotionally invested in the welfare of both Jesus and Aurora. In all, this is a wonderfully self-assured debut for a tyro filmmaker; as del Toro himself puts it, with typical humor and self-deprecation, in one of this DVD's many interview extras, it was made with absolute, mad, fat-man passion and put out to the world with sincerity and brutal honesty. Happily, that passion is clearly evident throughout this marvelous film.One final word concerning this DVD itself. It is a Criterion DVD, and I suppose that alone should testify as to its quality and generous content. Extras include interviews with del Toro, Perlman, Luppi and cinematographer Guillermo Navarro (who, incidentally, does a wonderful job here, and who would go on to win an Oscar for his work on Pan's Labyrinth), as well as del Toro's first short film, 1987's Geometria, AND a tour of del Toro's office\/house\/museum, Bleak House. This abode contains hundreds and hundreds of rare books, film collectibles and sundry horror\/fantasy pieces, and with any justice will one day be open to the public via paid admission. A most impressive collection, from a man whose love for film seems virtually boundless....

Meanwhile, his already tough predicament worsens when thuggish goon Angel (Ron Perlman, who himself would go on to appear in the del Toro films Blade 2, Hellboy and its sequel), emissary and nephew of dying millionaire De la Guardia (Claudio Brook), starts to get decidedly violent in his own search for the Cronos device....Strangely enough, the film that Cronos most brought to mind, as I watched it, was none other than the 1973 American film Ganja and Hess. In both pictures, a decent man is pierced by an ancient artifact (the dagger of Myrthia, in the earlier film) and becomes a vampire of sorts, although the V word is never mentioned in either film; in both films, our transformed man (Night of the Living Dead's Duane Jones, in the earlier picture) is shown daintily and disgustingly lapping up blood off of a floor! But that is pretty much where the similarity ends, and while Ganja and Hess is painfully slow moving and even managed the near-impossible task of putting me to sleep (the only film to ever accomplish this!), Cronos is at once compact, fast moving, suspenseful, colorful and exciting. It is also filled with all sorts of imaginative and oddball touches, such as Angel's nose fetish, a side trip to a very strange mortician's workshop, and those jars of (his very own) preserved organs that De la Guardia keeps on display. And speaking of oddball, the Aurora character is a very strange one indeed, a nearly mute little girl (I believe she speaks but a single word during the course of the entire film) whose unwavering love of and support for her grandfather--despite the horrible transformations he undergoes--are very much the sweet soul of this ultimately touching film. We care not a whit for the two central characters of Ganja and Hess, but get very much emotionally invested in the welfare of both Jesus and Aurora. In all, this is a wonderfully self-assured debut for a tyro filmmaker; as del Toro himself puts it, with typical humor and self-deprecation, in one of this DVD's many interview extras, it was made with absolute, mad, fat-man passion and put out to the world with sincerity and brutal honesty. Happily, that passion is clearly evident throughout this marvelous film.One final word concerning this DVD itself. It is a Criterion DVD, and I suppose that alone should testify as to its quality and generous content. Extras include interviews with del Toro, Perlman, Luppi and cinematographer Guillermo Navarro (who, incidentally, does a wonderful job here, and who would go on to win an Oscar for his work on Pan's Labyrinth), as well as del Toro's first short film, 1987's Geometria, AND a tour of del Toro's office\/house\/museum, Bleak House. This abode contains hundreds and hundreds of rare books, film collectibles and sundry horror\/fantasy pieces, and with any justice will one day be open to the public via paid admission. A most impressive collection, from a man whose love for film seems virtually boundless....

It's hard to imagine that this director, who now specializes in big budget Hollywood movies, started off by creating twisted and gory low budget movies &#x96; his directorial debut, Bad Taste, being the prime example of this early, strange phase. Bad Taste was by no means an easy experience for Jackson, since the filming took 4 years. However, the hard work paid off and Bad Taste can be used as a valuable lesson in do-it-yourself low budget film making. It's amazing how, in spite of rather limited resources, Jackson managed to make it all work and look good &#x96; he created the masks and firearm replicas for the movie himself. He even constructed his own counterweighted steady-cam. Bad Taste is a definite must see for every aspiring movie maker, if only for Peter Jackson's creativity.The movie follows 4 agents (called 'The Boys') of some sort of secret service, who investigate alien activity in a small town. Apparently, the aliens have killed the whole population and replaced it. Things become more complicated when the aliens kidnap a charity collector passing through, and it's up to The Boys to save him, by using any means necessary. As you can see, Bad Taste's plot is fairly simple, there isn't much story to it &#x96; the movie is mainly action and dialogue driven. Due to this fact, the movie gets boring from time to time and I find it to be the worst from Peter Jackson's early phase. I also find it to be the least funny one. While there are quite a few amusing scenes, it doesn't even come close to other early classics like Braindead and Meet the Feebles. But at least there is enough violence and gore in it to make it interesting. The movie does get pretty graphic. Did you first notice the guy missing the top of his head or the Peter Jackson cameo?The effects in the movie (influenced by the cult special effects artist Tom Savini) are surely its best quality. You'll see heads exploding, limbs being torn off and even some chainsaw action. The scene which impressed me the most was the one where a character, played by Peter Jackson, fights with another character &#x96; also played by Peter Jackson. Actually, if you're not informed prior to the watching of movie, you may not notice he plays two different characters since they don't really look alike. Who knows &#x96; maybe Jackson has an acting talent waiting to be further developed? Speaking of acting, the actors did an OK job for this kind of movie, no one is laughably bad. On a side note, I think it's important to remark that all of the dialogue was dubbed in post production; that, however, isn't much of a bother since it isn't very apparent.While I wasn't really keen on Bad Taste (like I said &#x96; I found it to be somewhat boring and I prefer other early Jackson works) I would definitely recommend it to everyone. It's a gory, funny trash\/cult flick about some guys fighting off a bunch of butt shaped aliens, set to an 80s heavy metal soundtrack.

The story is poor, but it goes even beyond this. It's not just a poor story and poor writing, but the story leaves no impact on us, as we have no idea who these new characters are. Much like how the original crew were first presented in Star Trek The Motion Picture, the characters here are presented extremely ridiculously and annoyingly, the greatest of them being Data, who could have come off as an interesting android for the remainder of this franchise but is literally depicted as Jar Jar Binks. Now, it is clearly evident where George Lucas got his influence from. See, Spock was a fatherly figure and a wise man and was an interesting and likable character. Data is supposed to be a similar character but here is presented in the most horrid manner much like how we were apparently supposed to view Jar Jar as a Yoda type character. Such event is referred to as deliberately taking a sh*t on one's head! Data is annoying and is horrible jokes about an emotion chip and how he is suddenly able to understand jokes that were told years ago is not funny, its downright ridiculous. And not in a good way like in Monty Python and the Holy Grail. This character should've been presented far better and horrible writing is clearly evident here. Not only is Data poorly written, so is Picard who throughout the film deals with such family issues, having recently received the news that his family has died. Two things make this completely a forgettable and unnecessary sub plot to the film This is the first time we even know who Picard is. There is obviously no reference in the original series due to the fact that this takes place over 70 years later. And secondly, the story about his family is hardly elaborated in anyway whatsoever and is instead, thrown in from the air and just left in a steady place. More poor writing is evident here. Each character is poorly written, to the fullest. The villain in the film, played by Malcolm McDowell, is yet again, another one of the many examples of poor writing in the film. His plan and his plot in the film is quickly summed up and almost never really referred to. Had he been written well, Soran could be a similar villain to Khan from the great 'Wrath of Khan'. Apparently in the film, Soran deals with personal issues of his own. Maybe&#x85;This character is hardly explained, due to horrible writing and has quite a silly and ridiculous plot. Whereas Star Trek 5 was ridiculous, it was not to this extent. The villain had a purpose that seemed more legit than here.Special effects are the same as all Star Trek films. Not great but decent enough for a pass. The acting is good, I would possibly say. Patrick Stewart as Picard is a great choice as is Malcolm McDowell as Soran but both are utterly wasted in this film. Returning is William Shatner, early on in the film as Captain James T. Kirk, in the best proportion of the film and returning late in the film in an extremely ridiculous concept.The best part of the film is the opening proportion as it cleverly resembles a good Star Trek film dealing with Kirk's desperation to get back into the captain's chair.

It's that bad.Well thank goodness I checked this thing out at the library and wasn't forced to waste good hard earned money renting a copy.Watch at your own risk. In fact, don't watch it.

And, that was just the first 10 minutes!Well, finally, just yesterday, I got a chance to see the whole and overlong film through to the end. And my first impression was Man, I am missing out on some incredible inside jokes. These guys lack both any tiny little bit of charisma or humor. What am I missing here?Don't get me wrong; I understood the jokes. I got where each one was headed from the beginning of each scene, I just kept thinking that this kept missing the mark everywhere.And no&#x85;I am not comparing it to the incredibly superior and similar Reno 911!. I let this movie stand on its own, but maybe that was a mistake since both the TV series Reno 911! and its movie took this concept, in addition to mocking the long-standing series, COPS, and improved in every step of the way.But, that's unfair to the movie, so, again, I watched it on its own merit.The very basic synopsis of Super Troopers is a bunch of wise-cracking boys in men's bodies are somewhat trying to hold on to their Highway Patrol jobs when budget cuts loom. So, after a long series of hijinks, the movie settles in on a plot (yeah, it took awhile to get there since I'm now referring to the third act) of proving themselves, albeit it's juvenile, once again.While the movie wasn't incredibly stale and unfunny, I didn't care for the cast whatsoever. There was no one I could latch onto, root for, care about. They may all be friends, or a group in real life &#x96; hence the inside joke I failed to get, but they were incredibly blah. Each and every one of them. Combine that with jokes that were ho-hum, it was a displeasure to get to the end.At least a childhood favorite of mine, Lynda Carter, showed up in a tiny, but welcoming part and there was a shower scene with the bear of the group.

During the scene of the first murder of Marion you could clearly see that she was being stabbed but at the same time you didn't see her cut up body, open wounds, or blood pouring down her body. You could only really see blood being flushed down the drain and even then it wasn't a lot of blood. I also found the cinematography to be good as well because during the murder scenes you could make out a shadow of the killer which made one believe that it was a woman because their hair was tied in a bun and you could clearly see women's clothing however that played an important role in making the murder unsuspecting by the audience and adds to the wow factor or the twist of who the murderer really is.

I hadn't seen it for a few years. I just can't help lovin' this film, every time I see it. It jumps straight into the story. Four bank robbers, going under alias's, their team name, the ex-presidents, (so you obviously know what names they go by) have successfully robbed these L.A. over summer spells, yet to be caught, until one of them brags too much, mooning a camera. Burned up FBI agent, Busey, has a notion these guys could be surfers. New hot shot, Johnny Utah, (Keanu Reeves) is partnered with him, who at first too, thinks his notions bologne. Reeves goes undercover as a surfer, and it isn't long before he's all buddy buddy with an truly devoted and poetic surfer, Bodhi, the ultimate thrill seeker. He's the head of this group who could be our guys, while getting on the wrong side of another group, an angry and scary looking group of drug frenzied surfers, neo nazi sorts, also suspects. Reeves can be forgiven for his acting here, you just love him as this cool cat character, putting a bit of Bill and Ted into it, especially in the finale scene, cool and classically memorable. Bodhi's ex girlfriend, Tyler (Lori Petty at her sexiest) is the more sensible one, who Reeves strikes up sexual relationship with. The movie never dulls, Reeves and Busey, a great duo, and I loved the ever great, John C (Platoon) McGinley as their captain where an anger management course wouldn't go astray. Too, watch out for Tom Sizemore in a grand moment, who's undercover operation is blown apart, on the account of this wrong and flimsy hunch. Some great and sufficient chase sequences, too, make it an action winner. The movie even makes parachuting look fun, and you gotta admire Keanu's steely determination when jumping out a plane, minus a chute. Check out the start of the last scene at Bells Beach, featuring a four second shot of Aussie, Peter Phelps. Too, check out the screenplay which is an awesome read, by an awesome writer who has some dialogue you'd kill for, one such line spouted by Bodhi, embedded in my mind, forever.
