But really, it's Johnny Depp who makes it a memorable film.The least interesting of the three main characters is the protagonist in this film, Aidan Quinn's Benny. Benny is the blue collar older brother of the mentally unstable Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson), an artist prone to fits including throwing things and pyromania. Both are adults, but Joon obviously needs to be cared for as if a child. After her most recent caretaker quites, Benny finds himself forced to think about sending Joon to a living community, but plans are stalled when an unusual young man ends up in their lives.Sam (Depp) is an eccentric, a young man who models his behavior off silent film star Buster Keaton and performs various physical comedy gags both on purpose yet also intuitively. He charms Joon and after awhile even manages to impress Benny, but he slowly starts to complicate the dynamic between brother and sister.Depp's performance exhibits Keaton but also Gene Wilder ala Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. He's a joy to watch and an absolute natural when it comes to quirkiness. Although audiences had a taste of his talent in Edward Scissorhands, it's this film where he shows just how excellent of a physical actor he is, foretelling of his eventual mainstream success.Interesting that Depp gets top billing in the credits when it's a film mostly centered on how Benny will deal with Joon. Perhaps Christmas Vacation director Jeremiah S. Chechik didn't realize until into filming how great of a performance he was going to get. Regardless, the script from Berry Berman and Lesley McNeil certainly didn't account for it. We spend too much time watching Benny mishandle Joon as well as his personal life despite his good heart and best intentions. A side plot he has with Julianne Moore as the waitress Ruthie completely detracts from the characters that should be getting more screen time, and it's frustrating because their conflict is handled with such immaturity on the part of both characters.With Joon's disorder not diagnosed for the audience, Masterson has little to draw upon for her performance, but she endears us to Joon with a wide-eyed approach whenever she's not throwing a tantrum. Her preoccupation with a man who also has his quirks but wears them so proudly makes a lot of sense, but we don't get to see their relationship blossom with so much of the film spent following Benny around.It's unclear whether writer Berman intended to have the other characters who aren't Joon make poor decisions about their lives in order to make a point. On one hand, such a notion would be wise and true to a certain degree, but on the other, the decisions are so rash that one has to question the authenticity of the characters.Benny & Joon mostly sees all its conflict underdeveloped, but the story generates enough curiosity to last the length of the film (though it could really be shorter). Depp's convincing and unusual turn brings a certain life, energy and most importantly memorability to the film, a comedy angle that the film sorely needs. Its approach to conflict is not serious enough to consider it a drama, but it's not nearly romantic enough to be considered a romance. Understandably, it's remembered as a comedy.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Based on the novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay, when Ray started this film, I think Ray had literally never held a movie camera. I understand that Italian neo-realist films had a big influence on him; all to the better. There are a number of key scenes shot in the film that beholds the beauty and emotional depth in itself. The film never had a complete script; it was made from Ray's drawings and notes. Ray tried to extract and build a simple theme out of the apparently random sequences of significants. Some notable shifts from the novel in the script include the death scenes of key characters, one which occurs quite early in the novel in a village shrine at the presence of some adult members of the family; in the film that key character dies in the open in the presence of the family children, Apu and Durga. The scene of Apu and Durga running to catch a glimpse of the train is not there in the novel, neither child manages to see the train there, although they made an attempt. That scene alone is well played. Such a beautiful scene. I love the sounds of the wind and the hum of the electricity, and the slow, fading edits. It captures perfectly the landscape and the young child's curiosity. The train shows the changes happening in India, and we know the children will grow into a world that is different to their parents. They are left gazing at a thin veil of smoke as the sound of the wind returns. It is very moving. Camera work as usual in Satyajit Ray's film is always brilliant as it has used lot of drifting tracking shot. There almost cosmic emotional power in some other scenes, such as the sunset with Apu and that of the monsoon. The scene from when the snake creeps into an abandoned 'house of sorrows' to their stunned faces on the ox cart was a unforgettable Ravi Shankar theme. I think it foreshadows death. Apu & sister Durga share an intimate bond, they exploring their little world and sharing secrets are the most remarkable aspect of this film. The language might be foreign to me but the emotions were completely native. The film took three years to complete the shooting, and it's was just lucky it got finished with little to no money to product. Pather Panchali was followed by two films that continued the tale of Apu's life 'Aparajito' (The Unvanquished) in 1956 & Apur Sansar (The World of Apu) in 1959. The only faults I can find in this film is that it's insanely depressing. The movie has a lot of death, and nothing really get any better for the family as the film goes on. There is no happy ever after, as this isn't Slumdog Millionaire. The movie is hard to find, and if found, it's rarely in English subtitles and the video transfer is horrible, the sound transfer only marginally better. Another factor is the disconnection by scene to scene, and gives an all-inclusive quality to the film; yet it is also distracting and contributes to the film's great weakness its general diffuseness, its inability to command sustained attention as the film pace is slow. For Pather Panchali, remarkable as it may be, is something of a chore to sit through. It's run time is 122 mins, and there are long periods of time of nothing going on. One can stare in dull amaze for only so long looking at nature. The first half is nearer to social realism, setting out the social hierarchies, introducing characters and their social or family role, defining them against other people, their home and nature. The second half of the film, however, becomes more abstract, even mystical. There is less reliance on words as characters go through strange rites where the emphasis is on observation or action. Film is still better than 2 most of today's loud, flashy torture bollywood movies. This film is true art.

The Good; Great performance from Jamie Lee Curtis, still gorgeous and a housewife who loves her husband but just wants a little more excitement in her life, love her little tremble with the coffee pot when he asks her how her day went. Surprisingly good performance from Tom Arnold as Schwarzenegger's sidekick and Tia Carrere is effortlessly sexy and devious as the villainess. Almost unnoticed amongst all this is a very young Eliza Dushku as Arnold's daughter who will grow up to become a fan-boy lust goddess and find fame and fortune in 'Bring It On' and Buffy\/Angel. The causeway chase is truly terrific, thrilling and funny, people actually got up in the cinema and clapped when they do the amazing stunt of pulling Jamie Lee Curtis' character clear of the limo's sunroof as it falls away beneath her (presumably in those pre-CGI days that was actually done for real?). The nuclear kiss scene is great, nice cameo from Charlton Heston and the portrayal of espionage is not actually that inaccurate, the sequence with Schwarzenegger and Tom Arnold in the helicopter juggling phones and radios as they try to organise everything is very true to life. The Bad; I know this is an action comedy but the depiction of the Arab terrorists is still so clichéd as to be borderline offensive, you wonder how much they had to pay a great Indian actor like Art Malik to take this role? That said his speech to the video camera does put his point across and is a dead ringer for some of the real terrorist propaganda videos you see nowadays. The action scenes aren't bad, especially the hotel bathroom sequence but sometimes come across as a little cartoonish, especially on the island. All told a great film but very much off its' time.

It's one of those films that you really want to like, and that you admire many of the decisions it makes. At the end of the day, however, it never really adds up to much. The movie opens promisingly; the opening shots of Gotham City convey the absolutely impeccable production design and the dark and ominous tone. It truly feels as though it's going to be a great film, but once the plot begins to set in, you realize that most of this admiration is based primarily on its surface qualities. There simply isn't a truly engaging story to feel attached to; the movie is almost entirely based around a simple battle of good versus evil, with Batman pitted up against his archenemy, the Joker. Aside from some promising revelations that never seem to add up to much, that's about it. Compare this with something like The Dark Knight, where the Joker wants to cause total chaos and anarchy in Gotham by breaking the city's spirits. He corrupts and even kills loved ones. Here, he only wants to take over the city. The stakes never feel real, and much of this is due to the characterization of Batman\/Bruce Wayne. It's understandable that they tried to make his character more introverted than, say, Christian Bale's depiction of the character, but that doesn't really work here. Yes, the character is similar in that sense in the comics, but film is an entirely different medium; Bruce Wayne seems too mysterious here, and so it's difficult to connect with him and to care about him. His character is clearly overshadowed by his archenemy. Speaking of the Joker, Jack Nicholson does an admirable job with what he's given, but something about the character feels... off. Before the incident that turns him into the white-skinned psychopath, he comes across as a suitably intimidating and ruthless threat. After that incident, he seems almost too comical. Sure, he's the definite villain, but he never really seems to embody the idea of true evil; it's tough to take him seriously when he's dancing to Prince songs. And this is honestly a problem that can be applied to most of the movie- it doesn't seem to really know what it wants to be. The film is dark and mysterious at various points, while relatively light-hearted and campy at others. It's like they tried to blend the styles of the Nolan version of the character and the Adam West version, and it doesn't work. In addition, with many of the plot revelation towards the end, Burton doesn't seem to know what to do with them. Batman claims he's on a quest for revenge, and even though we hear that, we never really see it. This review probably makes it seem like I hated the movie. I didn't. I admire it in many ways, along with what it attempted to do. In addition, I feel as though seeing the Nolan films first had already established what the story supposed to be in my head. That said, I still can't say that the film works. It simply never feels as engaging as a Batman story should be.Overall Rating 5\/10- I Have to Say Meh.
