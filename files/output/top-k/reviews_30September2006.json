Though movies like Poltergeist and The Shining gave me some shock and surprise, especially Kubrick's movie, the fact that so many of their scares are ground in popular culture made me feel as if I didn't get the full extent of their terror, because I knew most of what was coming. That is why I love horror movies that I know little about when I watch them, because everything comes as a surprise. The Innocents is just such a movie for me. It may be one of the most eerie and atmospheric movies I have seen. Unlike many horror movies, The Innocents builds up tension fairly early and gives the audience no break from it, no scene where the weight lifts from the audience and they can calm down. In the films more powerful scenes, I was almost begging for the next scene to be a calmer moment, to stop what was going on. The plot lets the audience know just as much of what is going on as the main character. I despise slasher films that let us know where the killer is at all times, so no death or attack comes as a surprise. In The Innocents, we get only vague hints as to what is going on, learning more as the character knows more and more. The direction and sets are incredible, and the house truly looks menacing in both the dark AND the light. The acting is fine across the board, particularly with the children, who perfectly give the impression of being sinister while still managing to behave like children. My only complaint about the movie is that the main character gets a very sure idea of what is happening a tad too early, and how she talks about what is happening to the children with incredible certainty was a bit unbelievable for me.I have noticed and been quite saddened by the lack of votes for this movie. It really needs to be seen by more people. I encourage you to check out this movie, and then tell other people about it. It is really an overlooked, tiny classic of horror and suspense.

This time round, the crew are faced with a violation of the Prime Directive and whether or not the 600 people who live on a literal planet-of-youth are more important than the millions of other people that could benefit from the planet's regenerative powers. Action, drama, comedy and romance follow in true Star Trek spectacular.As always Patrick Stewart is in top form as Captain Picard who leads the Star Trek resistance to save the innocents from one of his own corrupt superiors Vice Admiral Dougherty (played terrifically by Anthony Zerbe) who are involved with some aliens (including F. Murray Abraham's Ad'har). Along the way Picard finds a new friend in Anij (played by the lovely Donna Murphy), one of the Ba'ku, and a little romance follows.Jonathan Frakes once again directs and does an outstanding job, though it does mean his character Commander Riker gets a bit less screen time, though he is always a pleasure to watch. Riker's relationship with Commander \/ Counsellor Deanna Troi heats up in this film (and it's about time too!) Marina Sirtis of course returns as the lovely Troi and gets a fairly good amount of screen time this time round, and certainly most of the comical moments. Frakes and Sirtis have great chemistry together.Brent Spinter's Data gets (as usual) too much screen time, again his story consists of his quest to become more human and the like, though he does befriend a Ba'ku child which was done quite well. As usual Gates McFadden (Dr. Beverly Crusher), Michael Dorn (Lt. Commander Worf) and LeVar Burton (Lt. Commander LaForge) are given very little to do in the Star Trek films, and this one is no exception, though at least Worf and LaForge got their own small story lines - Worf had to go through puberty again and LaForge found himself with the ability to see. Beverly however only gets a storyline involving her boobs firming up. Terrific. Poor Gates must be the most under-appreciated actress in all of Star Trek, but also the most gracious for returning each time.The special effects of Star Trek Insurrection are above average, and the music score is really well done. Often its the small moments in the Next Generation films that are the best, and this one is no different, but at least the big moments are good too. I think the Star Trek the Next Generation films are probably the only action-type films in which the heroes are all (with the exception of Marina Sirtis) in their 50's and people still want to watch them.

Those guys have some very interesting things to say about the military and aviation. I wish there was just a commentary by them. I'm not a big fan of the US military, especially the stuff that's going on in the middle east right now, but on the DVD, they're the only ones with interesting stuff to say.It's a damn shame though, that we're stuck watching this boring, pointless and completely routine action movie. So at the beginning of the movie Maverick (Tom Cruise) and Goose (that guy from ER) are sent to the Top Gun flight school and are taught to be even better pilots than they are already. While there, Maverick seems to spend large amounts of time trying to bed a civilian employee (Kelly McGillis) and badly singing Righteous Brothers and Jerry Lee Lewis songs. Learning to be better pilots requires spending time looking hunky in towels\/white underwear and playing shirtless Volleyball, One day, Maverick is up flying around (like in most of the movie) when suddenly there's a big problem and Goose is killed. Of course he spends a huge chunk of movie time feeling bad and thinking of quitting and all that.Then suddenly they graduate from Top Gun school and the writer decided that now it's time for a war. So suddenly Maverick has to grow-up and fight the bad guys, save some good guys, hang out with Val Kilmer and just plain save the day. He comes back to the aircraft carrier and is told that his stupid name is on the front page of every English language paper in the world and he's now all happy again. He goes back to become an instructor and meets up with Kelly McGillis so that he can jam his tongue down her throat again, probably because she lost that loving feeling.I'd say that in this move Tom Cruise solidifies the kind of role that will define his career. In almost every single Tom Cruise movie, he starts out as a young cocky guy who thinks he knows everything and is completely full of himself. In almost every case, he'll keep on being cocky until about 3\/4 of the way through the movie either a friend dies or he become paralyzed or he finds out that the girl he nailed in the bahamas is pregnant, etc. Then he'll become mature and he'll prove himself to the rest of the world, or at least the people watching it. After a while, one Tom Cruise movie is just like another. Eventually Tom Cruise should find another role because after 20+ years, it's getting old.The movie itself is a blatant propaganda piece, meant to entice young men to join the military and young women to find shirtless guys playing volleyball. Much like Saving Private Ryan or Pearl Harbor, it's meant to get you all proud about the US military and maybe have you play some Born in the USA while raising the flag in your front yard. It's a feel good movie that ignores more serious problems of bad foreign policy and over spending on the military. But I guess those would be too complex of issues to raise during all the loud stock footage and motorcycle riding....

So at the beginning of the movie Maverick (Tom Cruise) and Goose (that guy from ER) are sent to the Top Gun flight school and are taught to be even better pilots than they are already. While there, Maverick seems to spend large amounts of time trying to bed a civilian employee (Kelly McGillis) and badly singing Righteous Brothers and Jerry Lee Lewis songs. Learning to be better pilots requires spending time looking hunky in towels\/white underwear and playing shirtless Volleyball, One day, Maverick is up flying around (like in most of the movie) when suddenly there's a big problem and Goose is killed. Of course he spends a huge chunk of movie time feeling bad and thinking of quitting and all that.Then suddenly they graduate from Top Gun school and the writer decided that now it's time for a war. So suddenly Maverick has to grow-up and fight the bad guys, save some good guys, hang out with Val Kilmer and just plain save the day. He comes back to the aircraft carrier and is told that his stupid name is on the front page of every English language paper in the world and he's now all happy again. He goes back to become an instructor and meets up with Kelly McGillis so that he can jam his tongue down her throat again, probably because she lost that loving feeling.I'd say that in this move Tom Cruise solidifies the kind of role that will define his career. In almost every single Tom Cruise movie, he starts out as a young cocky guy who thinks he knows everything and is completely full of himself. In almost every case, he'll keep on being cocky until about 3\/4 of the way through the movie either a friend dies or he become paralyzed or he finds out that the girl he nailed in the bahamas is pregnant, etc. Then he'll become mature and he'll prove himself to the rest of the world, or at least the people watching it. After a while, one Tom Cruise movie is just like another. Eventually Tom Cruise should find another role because after 20+ years, it's getting old.The movie itself is a blatant propaganda piece, meant to entice young men to join the military and young women to find shirtless guys playing volleyball. Much like Saving Private Ryan or Pearl Harbor, it's meant to get you all proud about the US military and maybe have you play some Born in the USA while raising the flag in your front yard. It's a feel good movie that ignores more serious problems of bad foreign policy and over spending on the military. But I guess those would be too complex of issues to raise during all the loud stock footage and motorcycle riding....

But these days so many crap are out there that makes me value Miyazaki movie so much. At least he tell a good story. I want to like this movie. I really really hope it will be good. But at the end I was let down once again.The director, Rintaro, have no sense of story telling. Almost every scene ended abruptly without any elaboration of what the purpose is. The fade in\/out is really being abused here.He could have use screen time to elaborate on the motives and background of various characters. Instead the film chose to explore everything in the world just a bit, then moved on to other areas. You think the story sucks? How about another far shot of some beautiful building in the mecha-city? About halfway through the movie suddenly everybody have a name. The robot is Fifi and Tima. Duh? Where that come from? Nothing make sense in this story. Who are the protagonists? Why do the police department send a COP to assist them in the story? Why does the old man reporter know so much about kung fu and computer engineering? What does the Dude Red want from the girl? Why make the girl robot at all? Who is Rocky? Why do Rocky hate robot? Did the robot rise up in rebellion at the end or not? The movie provide no answer to any of these questions. There are a lot of great ideas. I just wish the filmmaker will string them together into a story, instead of doing all the exposition in one stage where all the main character happen to stumble all into it. There you go, another samurai style scene with everyone laid down heroic dialogs without conveying any feeling in it.Oh one last gripe THe voice acting of Keiichi and the girl is just atrocious. I have no problem believing they are some relative of the producers who want to take a dip in the voice acting business.Otomo is a great manga artist, but his script sufferers from a lack of logic and lousy pacing. You want an example of bad scene? How about the angry mob waiting to confront 1 robot cop QUIETLY? They actually waited several minutes for the leader to explain to Mr.Robocop why they are rebelling before going nuts. Also one must remember NOT to put security guard outside your captured robot girl's room, so that she can escape with the made in a jiffy.Stop it Katsuhiro. Please draw more manga and let other more talented people write for anime movies.Also what's up with the obsession for the wiping out city Gozilla style? Just when i was wondering if this will be yet another anime that ends with the totally annihilation of Mega Tokyo, there it happen again. I guess Otomo runs out of ideas to how to bring it on that he actually put inside the huge building a SELF DESTRUCT button for the main villain to access.Brilliant.

As she gets older and gets more rejections from studios, she becomes a raging and abusive alcoholic, not to mention a neat freak, I don't think freak is a strong enough word.

Only two men can stop Hummel A brilliant Chemist named Stanley Goodspeed and the most lethal convict and spy alive John Mason.

Goodspeed is played well by the cool Nicholas Cage though at times he's a little strange. Ed Harris's performance is almost as good as Connery's as the grim-faced and determined General Hummel.
