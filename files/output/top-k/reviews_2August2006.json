You see it again 20 years later and you say &#132; It's a nice movie. You see Le Grand Bleu and say &#132;Amazing!. See it 20 years later and all you'll be able to say is &#132;Amazing!. That makes all the difference.For me Le Grand Bleu will always have a special meaning in my life. In fact, I realized that it is a reason (and there aren't many movies of that kind for me, perhaps just few) why I really love this art. I said reason because Le Grand Bleu is much more than a movie. You can consider it as a poetry in motion dedicated to the See, but it goes far beyond that.Difference between this and other movies (even Besson's) is that director really &#132;put himself into it, he made it personal (see dedication), right from the heart. Result is a movie with a soul. I have feeling this is just the movie he wanted to make, without anyone forcing him to change anything (I'm talking about 163min version longer and original French version).Beautiful story about love, friendship, connection between man and a Nature (See) and something we seek for all our lives goes much deeper than the spoken or written words can say. Just look what reviews people wrote about it!However, here is technical part Luc Besson did excellent job, camera is incredible (notice usage of blue colour), actors fit their role perfectly and screenplay is great (some would say there isn't any &#150; yes there is, but sometimes picture reveals something words never could). It would be a shame not to mention incredible music composed by Eric Serra &#150; one of the best soundtracks ever follows movie perfectly (nothing can beat original ending with My Lady Blue).Of course, I can tell you that Le Grand Bleu belongs to the top 3 movies I have ever seen and believe me, I have seen a lot (forget &#132;soulless, Oscar winners described above and top 100 classics people always talk about, this is something different) and that it is the most underrated movie on this site (it should be ranked over 9, at least 8.8), but when it comes to Le Grand Bleu, it really doesn't matter.Without smallest hesitation, 10\/10.

Well, let's just say they did, a lot of people didn't like this movie because they said it was DUMB. I got to tell you there are some DUMB parts in the movie, but they make the movie hilarious. We all know Harland Williams for his sense of humor, and yes, he does have a great part in the movie, loved his scene with the two lead actors.Jim Carrey plays a limo driver, who drives Lauren Holly to the airport, and he ends up having a crush on her. Lauren leaves a suitcase at the airport and the movie is about Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels giving everything up so they can give the suitcase back to Lauren. Will the boys make it in time? Well, they might be delayed by a few bad guys, a state trooper and a whole bunch of crazies.I loved this movie though, I thought it was really funny. Jim Carrey is hilarious of course, duh, everybody that's seen one of his movies knows that, and Jeff Daniels he shows that he's got a great sense of humor to, and the guys just play it off one another perfectly. I love Lauren Holly's look that she gives the camera when Lloyd (Jim Carrey) comes up and hugs her, it's priceless. I chose to give this movie a 7 out of 10, because yes it is a good movie, it's one of those movies though where you laugh at the actors and the story because it's so dumb, it's funny. There were a lot of great scenes, and the actors were wonderful, it's got a good story, a couple memorable lines, but the potty humor kind of got to me, a little too much for my taste.

I left the theatre more excited about this movie than any horror movie I had yet seen. The ending caught me totally by surprise and had my little circle of friends (all two of us) speculating over its implications for many days thereafter. To say that this movie left things a little up in the air would be a misstatement of massive proportions. Not only was I left to ponder the fate of Michael, Dr. Loomis, and little Jamie, I was mystified by the man in black. Who was he? What was his role in all of this? I still think the concluding 10 minutes of this movie are the best 10 minutes of the entire Halloween series, although I would not dare place this movie on the same pedestal as the original film, which is basically untouchable by all pretenders to the horror crown.I have nothing but the greatest respect for nine-year-old Danielle Harris. The makers of Halloween 5 put this poor girl through the wringer, and she shines from start to finish in one of the most physical roles I have ever seen man, woman, or child play. As the movie opens, she is living in a children's clinic, unable to talk since the shocking events of the previous Halloween night and increasingly prone to seizures and fits brought on by some kind of psychic connection with her uncle Michael. Eventually, she finds herself running for her life as her uncle chases her down with a car and then his trusty knife. Then toward the end comes the unforgettable scene in which she finds herself lodged in a laundry chute inside the abandoned Myers house desperately trying to stay alive. The depth of emotion and sense of utter terror she is able to convey is really quite extraordinary I have to admit I didn't particularly care for this incarnation of Michael. No man can compare to the original Shape, Nick Castle, but the real problem for me in this movie is Michael's mask. It just hangs loosely around his neck, and the sight of it flopping out on both sides like an extra pair of very large earlobes really kept me from seeing this masked killer as the Michael I know and love. Donald Pleasance is, as usual, incredible as Dr. Loomis. I admit, Loomis seems to be getting a little bit loony by this point in the series, but who can blame him? Every time, he tells the authorities what is going to happen, yet no one ever believes him until it is too late. Bearing the scars of previous encounters with Michael, his bravery and obsession with Michael Myers earns him five stars in my book every single time.Here are a few problems with this movie. Let's start with the obvious. What is wrong with the people in Haddonfield? It is very important to keep in mind the fact that no body was ever found of a seemingly vanquished Michael after the events of the previous year. Rachel, having barely lived through Halloween 4, not only leaves a spare key to her house on top of the doorframe, she leaves the door wide open while she is taking a shower. Then there are these moronic teenagers consuming far too much of our time. They insist on playing practical jokes on each other and even on the cops, finding the whole Boogeyman subject incredibly funny for some reason unknown to me. It's hard not to cheer for Michael as he goes after these goofs. Tina is incredibly immature, her boyfriend with the car fetish is unbearable, and her horny friends annoyed me as much as they apparently annoyed Michael. Then we come to the cops. Apparently, Michael's previous adventures have decimated the local police force because they are letting some incompetent people wear a badge these days. Hearing some type of obvious clown music play when the two super cops first appear is basically unforgivable as far as I'm concerned. Apparently, these two characters were supposed to supply some comic relief to a movie that needed nothing of the kind.Overall, I think this movie has moments of greatness that, for the most part, make up for its flaws. Danielle Harris is amazing, and the final 10-15 minutes are riveting. More than anything, though, I have to return to the fact that I left the movie theatre all those years ago totally excited about this movie and its mysterious twists and turns.

Even then if you are anything like me you will find it only mildly funny during your first viewing. As others have said it really does get funnier each time you watch it, probably because you have to know the characters to appreciate much of the humor and because during the first viewing you are burning too much mental energy trying to follow the relatively complex plot (while not as complex as Miller's Crossing it still challenges viewers to pay close attention). The DVD does not have a commentary but it does have a short feature full of interviews, where the Coen Brothers explain some of their rationale for certain elements in the script and reveal places where the cast put their own individual marks on the film.The Big Lebowski features the Coen's trademark comic style. They are students of films and their secret is taking a traditional character and creating an incongruity between the way you expect the character to talk and behave (as per movie conventions) and what actually happens. For The Big Lebowski the Coen's play with the detective, buddy picture, and the suspense genres. They set up a Philip Marlowe episodic detective story, but as their main character they substitute an aging pot-smoking bowler (Jeff The Dude Lebowski played by Jeff Bridges) for the film noir detective. Like Marlowe, the Dude gets caught up in scheme a whole lot bigger than he is and gets episodically pushed and pulled by a lot of strange characters. His buddy Walter Sobchek (John Goodman) is a blustering Viet Nam veteran who manages to further complicate almost every situation. Much of the humor comes from the way the supposedly laid back Dude continually comes unglued over Walter's behavior. Finally the Coens incorporate not one but two Hitchcock MacGuffins into the film. The series of unfortunate events are set in motion by a rug (the floor covering type) and midway into the film it is replaced as a motivating factor by a young woman (Tara Reid). Ultimately neither is of any importance yet they are the reason for everything that happens in the film. New Lebowski fans can be found drinking White Russians, entering their local bowling alley for the first time in years, looking up nihilist in the dictionary, and checking to see if TVLand is showing any Branded reruns.

As others have said it really does get funnier each time you watch it, probably because you have to know the characters to appreciate much of the humor and because during the first viewing you are burning too much mental energy trying to follow the relatively complex plot (while not as complex as Miller's Crossing it still challenges viewers to pay close attention). The DVD does not have a commentary but it does have a short feature full of interviews, where the Coen Brothers explain some of their rationale for certain elements in the script and reveal places where the cast put their own individual marks on the film.The Big Lebowski features the Coen's trademark comic style. They are students of films and their secret is taking a traditional character and creating an incongruity between the way you expect the character to talk and behave (as per movie conventions) and what actually happens. For The Big Lebowski the Coen's play with the detective, buddy picture, and the suspense genres. They set up a Philip Marlowe episodic detective story, but as their main character they substitute an aging pot-smoking bowler (Jeff The Dude Lebowski played by Jeff Bridges) for the film noir detective. Like Marlowe, the Dude gets caught up in scheme a whole lot bigger than he is and gets episodically pushed and pulled by a lot of strange characters. His buddy Walter Sobchek (John Goodman) is a blustering Viet Nam veteran who manages to further complicate almost every situation. Much of the humor comes from the way the supposedly laid back Dude continually comes unglued over Walter's behavior. Finally the Coens incorporate not one but two Hitchcock MacGuffins into the film. The series of unfortunate events are set in motion by a rug (the floor covering type) and midway into the film it is replaced as a motivating factor by a young woman (Tara Reid). Ultimately neither is of any importance yet they are the reason for everything that happens in the film. New Lebowski fans can be found drinking White Russians, entering their local bowling alley for the first time in years, looking up nihilist in the dictionary, and checking to see if TVLand is showing any Branded reruns. If any of that sounds like fun you should definitely check out the film.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

Both cinematic spectacles drew heavily from Ben-Hur,a story of catastrophic defeat,steadfast inspiration,tremendous action and overwhelming faith. The epic that all but invented and continues to define the swords-and-sandals genre,Ben-Hur is a tale of scummy politics,atrophied friendship and brutal,unjustified punishment. Ultimately,as nearly all great films are, Ben-Hur is a story of love. The film moves with an assurance and majesty that is hardly seen in modern movies. It's certainly in no hurry to get started,content to roll out with a deliberate,operatic sweep. The film begins with a 6-minute,30-second orchestral overture(composed by Miklos Rosza)focusing on the Sistine Chapel image of man's hand outstretched toward the touch of God. The introduction works to calm you and allow you to settle in for a grand scale of an epic.At the focus of the story is the rivalry between Hebrew prince Judah Ben-Hur(Charlton Heston)and his childhood friend,Roman politician Messala(Stephen Boyd),drunk with newfound power.Judah refuses to go along with Messala's request to help quell rebellions,and the twisted Messala takes revenge by falsely accusing Judah,his mother and sister of treason and attempted assassination. Judah is stripped of his wealth and prominence,ripped away from the woman he loves-from his servant's daughter,who is promised to another man-and condemned to slavery. The one thing that keeps Judah alive through years of punishment is sheer hatred of Messala. Judah's rise to freedom and renewed power is an inspiring as it is frightening. It becomes clear as the story proceeds that Judah is gradually becoming just like Messala,with whom the conflict reaches fever pitch in a 11-minute chariot race,one of the most brilliant action scenes ever filmed in cinematic history. Director William Wyler carried a flourish-free,straightforward approach throughout a career that began in the silent era and spanned through the 1960's. He was nominated 12 times for the best-director Oscar and won three times for Ben-Hur,Mrs. Miniver and the after World War II epic,The Best Years Of Our Lives. For those who made have never heard of Wyler,that's probably because his unique style didn't stand out in the manner of such Hollywood directors as John Ford,Alfred Hitchcock or David Lean. Instead of forcing a signature the material,Wyler has a way of doing things his way. While the luminaries of his period tended to bend scripts toward their own visions,Wyler bought into the story wholeheartedly adapting his own techniques to best serve the film. Wyler plunges through Ben-Hur with a fortuitous assuredness. His most masterful choice is his depiction of Christ,whose story unfolds silently behind the scenes,sometimes intersecting with the trials of Judah. Wyler never shows us his face,but implies the effect Jesus has on others through his interaction with others. We see Christ reflected in reverent reaction shots. Christ comes forth poetically as a character of inspiration and charisma.Ben-Hur,was MGM's bold desperate move to avoid bankruptcy,and the idea to make the film was seen as audacious at the time since it was a remake of the 1925 silent adaption of the Lew Wallace novel. Several actors passed on the lead role,including Rock Hudson and Burt Lancaster. Wyler,who started his career as an assistant director on the 1925 version was a natural choice to helm the $15 million production,colossal for its day. Filmed in MGM Camera 65(Super Panavision 70),and magnificent Technicolor. Filming Ben-Hur,with lavish sets,sprawling cast and excruciatingly difficult special effects must have taken a dogged resolved that matched that of Judah. The results became one of the highest grossing pictures of that year,when it was released in 1959. The risk paid off well in a total of 11 Oscars,including Best Picture,director,actor(Charlton Heston),and supporting actor(Hugh Griffith),as well as the windfall of a $70 million domestic box office return. The motion picture Ben-Hur is tied with James Cameron's 1997 epic Titanic,which won 11 including Best Picture,and the final installment of Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings Trilogy Return Of The King,also got 11 Oscars including Best Picture of 2003. Both movies had match Ben-Hur's astounding record with the number of Oscars. It was re-released in theatres numerous times by the studio and became one of the biggest roadshow spectacles attractions of all time. The take,however,is minuscule when compared to what it gave back to filmdom and Hollywood as a whole.

There is a fantastic line in the title track of the film which says Jail Main Kitne Log Sade, Sooli Pe Nirdosh Chadhe(so many innocent people have rotted in the Jails and hung on the line). That exactly is the theme of this film. I rented this film to understand the IRA conflict but this film taught me more than that. It is so scary to see people dwelling in the jail for the crimes they have not committed. This film is an example that we are goofed up as human beings and not as Indians or Americans or Britishiers.

I knew full well going into it that it was a completely new story, and was well prepared for something different. I don't hate this movie because it's different, I hate it because it's bad. Michael Myers and the rest of the Halloween series is the only reason why this film even got a DVD release in the first place. There is a reason why Halloween 4 went back to the Michael Myers story line. I know there are people out there who don't believe that this is a monumentally stupid film. And since I have my collection of bad horror that I love and everyone else hates, I'm not going to slight them for that. I'm just going to do my best to explain why I personally don't feel that people should watch this movie under any circumstances.First of all, there is no Michael Myers. Our story centers around two people, a man and a woman, who are out to uncover a conspiracy that a company selling children's Halloween masks is really trying to make spiders, snakes, and other icky stuff crawl out of the kids' heads at exactly the same moment. For reasons far too ridiculous to recount here, the masks will cause this to happen on Halloween night when children all over the country will gather around their TV sets for something called The Big Giveaway. Now, I know that this movie is trying to make some sort of crappy point about commercialism. But why would a corporation even want to do that? They got theirs when they convinced the kids' parents to shell out the money for those trendy masks. Is it some sort of human sacrifice for the God of Corporate Greed? I suppose it could be seen as a lousy metaphor for the negative influence of advertising on children, but they couldn't come up with anything better than this? Now what really burns me up about the anti-commercialism message is not the fact that it's a poorly constructed metaphor, but the blatant hypocrisy of it all. This is called Halloween 3 because it takes place on Halloween. Clever, huh? Well, Halloween 3 is not just a clever title. They used that title for this movie so that all the idiots who loved the first two Halloween movies would rush out and see this craptacular travesty of cinema, believing it to be the next in the series. (Idiots like myself, perhaps?) Exploiting the success of a popular horror franchise with a third-rate sequel? That is commercialism at its worst! At one point, the man and the woman have to check into a hotel. The man says something that I will roughly translate here as, Hey, we're both pretty unattractive, I'm a lot older than you, there is zero sexual tension between us, and more importantly, we have to get moving to stop all those kids from having spiders and snakes crawl out of their heads. But since you're a woman, and I'm a man, and we're in a hotel room right now, can we have sex? Now if this were a REAL Halloween movie, Michael Myers would come and kill them. As we know from watching the first Halloween film, the source of Micheal's angst is that he knows that sex must only be enjoyed within the confines of the sacred bond of holy matrimony. And these two tramps are breaking his rule! But alas, this is a faux Halloween movie, and you will find yourself hoping against hope that these two one-dimensional characters will be killed off.It occurs to me that Micheal's mask is so much cooler than any of the dorky masks the kids are wearing. If they tried to make this an anti-commercialism movie by mass marketing his image as a serial killer, and selling kids masks that looked like HIS, it might be a little more interesting. But of course, that is like saying that watching paint dry on an artist's canvas is more interesting than watching paint dry on a white wall.A lot of people think this movie sucks because Michael Myers isn't in it. But if this garbage never purported to be a Halloween movie in the first place, and was released under a completely different title, it would still suck! (What title would that be anyway? Season of the Witch? I'm not exactly sure where that came from. I know it's a rather odd George Romero movie about a bored housewife, but this movie doesn't have anything to do with that movie, or witches, for that matter.) Halloween 3 Season of the Witch is bad for reasons that having nothing to do with how good the Halloween series was before this godawful entry.After you watch part 2 forget about part 3. Don't worry about watching part 4 later, and not knowing what's going on, because it won't matter. If you rent the Halloween movies, just pretend that the video store clerks left a crappy, unrelated movie in between part 2 and the next in the series, which they did.

I suppose it could be seen as a lousy metaphor for the negative influence of advertising on children, but they couldn't come up with anything better than this?

I enjoy this style myself, but I can readily believe other people disliking it intensely.One common objection by people who disliked it is that either the film has no plot, or that the plot is not original. The plot is there, and it is essentially the same story used in several operas of the 19th century, and more than one musical of the 20th. The important insight that helps one understand this film, is that in a well honored tradition stretching back to Homer, the plot is not the point of the work, but rather the scaffolding on which the story-telling occurs. In opera, it is most unusual to walk in to the theater without already knowing the plot. Homer's Odessy and Iliad are both stories that would have been known by his audience. In both cases, the cleverness, the art, is in how the story is told. Moulin Rouge! is very much opera for the big screen, and it is built on this conception of story-telling. So, yes, it is style over substance, and deliberately so.That said, if a plot is to be successful scaffolding to tell an engaging story, then it has to have some bones to it. This classic story of the consumptive courtesan who falls in love has lots of song themes in it about what is important in life, life's fleeting nature, and so on. Where the film loses many people, who haven't connected to the operatic style, is that having communicated enough bits of the plot to tell us which story is being told (and the bookend structure tells us that right away), there is no obligation to join all the dots. Having given us the message that it is *this* story, it can skip over the details of the plot in order to concentrate on which ever aspects of the telling it likes.This is clear in how the snatches of song are used.

I watched the movie at least three times in the first weekend I got it. Obviously, I consider it a terrific film - one of the rare times when I disagree entirely with Ebert.O'Toole is magnificent, as he was a couple of years later in My Favorite Year. The roles both call for a person who absolutely is Larger Than Life, who dominates the screen every moment he's on it. O'Toole personifies that quality. (I've often thought that's why The Lion in Winter could work - Hepburn was the same kind of woman, especially as she got older, and they were the only two who COULD have stood up to one another on screen, although at that time there were still a few people around who could have managed Richard Burton comes to mind - when he was on, he was ON).Some of the comments have stated that they thought Railsback was just muddling through. According to O'Toole's comments, the two of them would spend hours after filming each day was over sitting around talking about the roles and interpretations and acting in general - whether you liked Railsback's performance or not (I did), it had to have been VERY deliberate. That Helter-Skelter had come out before The Stunt Man was a lucky coincidence, since The Stunt Man was filmed first, but it was great in convincing you subconsciously that this guy might be a serious wacko from the start. But there were little throw-aways Rush stuck in that helped you in that way, like a little overheard remark the pretty and slutty hairdresser makes about that guy who killed all those campers as she's getting out of the car after dinner. These all combine to make the denouement when Cameron's crime is finally revealed especially exciting (and hysterically funny).Hershey is remarkable. In one scene, they are filming the film within the film and she is made up and dressed like an old woman at the grave of her long dead lover. You KNOW she is really a young and beautiful actress (not an old woman), you KNOW that this is a fictional script within a fictional script, the scene lasts all of three minutes, and her performance never fails to bring me to tears. Interestingly, what immediately follows the prop-man knocking over a light and her bursting into tears was not scripted at all. Rush, in a rather Eli Cross-like move, told O'Toole to wait until Hershey really got the scene right (that kind of emotional work-up apparently can take several takes to really hit the spot), at which point he (Rush) would signal O'Toole to go out and speak to Hershey. O'Toole, being the experienced actor he was, didn't need the signal; he just walked over to her and hugged her, whispering You were brilliant in her ear, at which point HERSHEY, not the character, burst into tears and jumped into a full body hug on O'Toole (legs around the body, I mean). The whisper was later over-voiced by O'Toole for the movie as Thank you, my baby. which was more appropriate for the director (I'd never really thought about it, but doing that kind of scene well has GOT to really take it out of you!). A brilliant idea on Rush's part, superbly executed by O'Toole. But Hershey, whose character was loosely called by the cast The Dream Girl (obviously from Cameron's viewpoint), gave an excellent performance all the way around of a complex woman, neither totally good nor totally bad. She's egotistical, self-centered, a bit spoiled, but not to the point of losing her humanity or general niceness. And she's SO damned beautiful! I hate movies where you have no idea what's going on, or where there are simply no characters you can stand. I am not an intellectual film buff who infinitely prefers Indies and Foreign films to mainstream American stuff. But I LOVED this movie. You know that you're not sure exactly what's real at any given moment, but that's fine, because eventually you FIND OUT. You're not left at the end of the movie going huh?

And in the meantime, there's a real, honest-to-God plot happening that you CAN follow, and a lot of humor and wit to enjoy.This is and I expect will remain on my top ten movie list for life. Part of that is a major love of Peter O'Toole, but most of it is that the movie itself is just plain great, if you don't mind being jerked around when you know you're being jerked around (this seemed to be Ebert's major gripe - once it became obvious early on that the movie was going to be jerking you around, he no longer gave a darn). It was very clever, and I LIKE clever movies.

Other characters in the film are also very well acted, especially the bartender and Bim who gives Don a scary lesson about the dark side of alcoholism. There are some pretty striking scenes here if you think that this was made in the 40's. The scenes where Don and other alcoholic sees the hallucinations are pretty rough for a Hollywood picture at that time and Wilder does give a pretty merciless description of an alcoholism. But even though Don drinks, he is still very warm and sympathetic character and as he is aware himself that he has a problem and he thinks he is a looser, it's easy to feel kind of sorry for him.The movie is more of a review for a dark side of alcoholism rather than asking the reason for it. It's a one man story about how bottle is everything he has and care about. You don't need to know why he drinks and movie does not even try to explain that. Which is good i think because the it would easily go too pathetic for telling reasons why Don became what he is. Movie starts when Don has been already alcoholic for years and story goes back only to tell how Don met his girlfriend. And he was a drunk then already! Many here criticize the music score here but i think it's one of the best i've heard from Miklos Rozsa. Especially the scenes where Don is trying to find the bottle from his house and when he sees those visions are musically great and gives a great point of view to Don's confused state of mind. It's not an usual Rozsa score and that makes it more interesting as it seems that he has tried something different here with using theremin and more experimental themes.There are a few flaws though that's why i have to drop a couple of stars. In the beginning when Don suddenly wants his brother go to the concert instead of him seems a little bit too obvious. And if his brother has seen these lies for years, he pretty easily takes his story. And the bigger flaw is the ending. I was kind of hoping that the ending would follow the movie's straight storyline and not happy ending would have made this almost a 10 star movie. It's a shame that in Hollywood it's so rare that movies end like the director wants them to end. Especially here the ending feels really out of place and i don't think they would have released this movie without the happy end. Despite the flaws it's still a good movie and this is another example of Billy Wilder's great directing skills.

I was very impressed with how Sean Connery could pull of playing a Russian even with his Scottish accent.

The movie which turned around the horror genre and gave us one of the most unforgettable villains and endings, is, and always will be a horror classic. Friday the 13th doesn't set out to be glossy and glamorous. Friday the 13th sets out to do what it wants to do; and that is, make you sit on the edge of your seat, feel uncomfortable and unnerved, to make you frightened when you go to bed after watching it. Friday the 13th delivers all of the fantastic horror goods. The plot revolves around American teenagers, who are the new counsellors at the apparently jinxed Camp Crystal Lake. These naive, horny youngsters have a one-track mind and break all of the innocent borders which has more depth than you would think. Basically, the message is Don't have pre-marital sex, or you'll die just like many of Friday the 13th's predecessors and clones send out as well. Friday the 13th has a variety of characters, all who you could possibly relate to. These characters are then slowly followed and hacked off one by one, in dark, gory, claustrophobic manners, which may leave you frightened in the same way Psycho made showers scary. As the camp counsellors are knocked off one by one, the tension rises higher and higher. Along the journey of carnage, the hugely effective soundtrack really creeps under your skin, highlighting how jumpy and scary the events happening on screen really are. For example when a chase scene occurs, the music may speed up, the tempo rising and jittering, almost moving like the characters on screen are. The acting in Friday the 13th is not bad at all; some of the actors\/actresses may be a little amateur, but there is nothing terrible in this picture. The settings are also very effective. The stalkings and slaying in broad daylight and open spaces are a twist in a new direction, showing that not everything has to happen in the dark, in a small isolated house on the top of a hill, so the variation of location makes forests, cabins and even lakes more unappealing to the viewers afterwards, and may leave them creeped out by the aforementioned places. The camera-work is also very effective. The way the camera 'stalks' the victim behind trees and bushes, and the way the camera chases after it's victims as the point of view of the villain is unique and exciting, and adds a more tense and faster chill to the movie. Friday the 13th may play as a clichéd slasher, a story of sex equalling carnage, but it plays so effectively well it is a too important horror movie to simply be dismissed. It collects everything appealing about the 80's horror genre and wraps it up neatly into this fantastic horror package. A classic in it's genre.

It will appeal to a much younger audience (making it instantly suitable for classroom use) and it will show the world that what Shakespeare wrote is still applicable to modern day. Unfortunately, it did not work out the way it should have. One of the fatal flaws was that the text was not followed as closely as I would have liked it. In fact, things were added that were hideously out of place and two important parts that should have been included have been omitted. However, it is virtually impossible to create an exciting film without playing with the text a little, so the writers have been forgiven as far as I'm concerned.The one thing that I really cannot let pass is the combination the setting makes with the text. Keeping the original text with a modern setting has been done successfully in the past. The director here chose to make the setting and its characters over the top. The way the young Montagues and the young Capulets are portrayed may be clear, but it is also annoying to see that the Montagues are shown as surfer\/stoners and the Capulets as Latino gangsters. This, combined with the setting, decors and acting makes for a film that is extremely over the top. This simply does not work with a text that is subtle, where most of the humour and entertainment is to be had from small quips and remarks, not from broad-sweeping statements and grandeur. Especially the love between Romeo and Juliet should be quiet, not playful as it is in this film.Of course there are some good things about this film. In keeping with Shakespeare's love of subtle word jokes, this film has quite a few. There are several 'hidden' hints to other Shakespearean plays. Also, I liked the newscaster as opening chorus. This gave the film an air of modernity while still keeping the goal of the prologue, which is introducing the play. These things made for a two hours that were not completely awful.I am somewhat of a purist when it comes to Shakespeare, although I do like it when people take freedoms with the text or the setting. However, Romeo + Juliet strayed too far from the nest.
