[{"date":"27 October 2013","score":"","review":" Odd goings-on at Herrington High in Ohio, featuring an all-star cast.First the faculty, then most of the students, get taken over by alien parasites.A small band of outsiders among the students manage to evade the parasites.The local pusher discovers that one common drug kills the infested humans.Next job, taking out the faculty, and finding the 'queen' of the parasites.It all goes right down to the wire.-----Scores-----Cinematography 10\/10 Quite good.Sound 10\/10 No problems.Acting 6\/10 Mostly fine, with a few exceptions Laura Harris, and Usher Raymond come to mind. On the other hand, most of the acting was competent or better. I enjoyed Elijah Wood, Famke Janssen, Bebe Neuwirth, Piper Laurie, Clea Duval, Robert Patrick, Jordana Brewster, and Josh Hartnett.Screenplay 8\/10 Story hangs together nicely; it's well worth watching. Some years ago, I saw this on commercial television; that version had only VHS quality and about 200 lines of dialog replaced. I found that version annoying, and would have rated it around 5\/10. With better picture quality, zero commercials, and the original lines in place, the film is much better.

That's what Monsters Inc is. James P. Sullivan (John Goodman) is the top scarer, and Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) is his best friend. Together they work at Monsters Inc. One night after work, Sully opens a door by himself and a child sneaks in threatening contamination.The characters are fun. But this is Paxar. So I expect nothing less than the best. That means comparing to Toy Story. I like the Toy Story characters much better, and there are more of them. Monsters Inc basically has two big likable characters. Quite frankly, the kid is more annoying than cute and the odd monsters wear thin. We all have the toys in Toy Story but the monster aren't as nostalgic.The animation looks good for its time. It's certainly not ground breaking as Toy Story (1995) was. It's better than Toy Story by a small degree but we haven't reached a new level yet.

","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"27 October 2013","score":"","review":" My Cousin Vinny was a hit when it was released in 1992. Two youths from New York are wrongly accused of murder while traveling through the Alabama and one of them (Ralph Macchio) calls on his inexperienced lawyer cousin, Vinny (Joe Pesci), to defend them. Vinny roles into town with his hot fiancé (Marisa Tomei) intent on winning his first big case.I've heard a lot about this movie over the years, but never got around to seeing it till the other night and was pleasantly surprised. It's part fish-out-of-water comedy and part courtroom drama. The hulking Fred Gwynne plays the staunch judge, an excellent performance. This was Gwynne's last film. The movie is filled with laughs throughout, but it's more than just a goofball comedy. At some point early in the second act I strangely found myself liking Vinny and wanting him to succeed. I also found myself warming up to Vinny and his fiancé as a couple. They're an odd couple, but they somehow click. I guess this is where Marisa got the reputation for liking short, stocky men, huh? Speaking of Marisa, she's just stunning here, although I prefer her more as she gets older, e.g. 2008's The Wrestler.The film was shot in Georgia and runs 120 minutes.GRADE B+ ","genre":null},{"date":"27 October 2013","score":"","review":" My Cousin Vinny was a hit when it was released in 1992.
