The story in this sense is fitting as the final chapter in a trilogy, but ultimately, Kruger doesn't seem to quite get it. It's as if Scream 3 is an impostor - something like out of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. It may look like Scream, and it tries to act like Scream, but it's not Scream - even if some casual passer-byers can't tell the difference. Thus Scream 3 lacks an identity and never figures out what kind of movie it is. Scream 3 seems in search for it's soul which is something it seems it cannot have without Kevin Williamson, even if Wes Craven is directing it.

Still, Alien is one of the most famous movie that was ever made; this even applies today, in the twenty-first century, while, as we know, it belongs to the twentieth century. Indeed, with all these references in TV series, comics, shows, movies, music etc., it is impossible that you miss that one, especially when you like science-fiction (more than horror - you clearly see that the Alien is a puppet (it was not gonna be a real one dude!), and this, surely thanks to advantage of hindsight, curtails the overall ''horror'' aspect of the movie; to my mind, only a few elements in this movie are scary actually.) The screenplay is simply astonishing, the action is yet quite slow, fortunately, and the visual is aging, but the overall effect is that it brings suspense rather than impatience. Sigourney Weaver, who embodies the young Ripley, is very convincing in the way she acts and reacts, and, unlike nowadays' movies, you cannot tell from the beginning who is going to survive and who is not. Even when you have seen AVP first (I was born in 1991 so that it was impossible for me to see Alien when it came out!), you have the impression to watch a different franchise that you are pleased to discover again and again. No, this movie is far from being boring, this movie is in fact a vintage and I hope that it will remain so, at least until the end of the world (2012 ? oops, that's another story...) Believe me or not, when watching this film, I understood what the seventh art really was. There is little horror in this title, and do not come to the idea that Alien the first has something to do with the 2007 AVPR, in simple words, I see no relation between the two. If you do not know any of the Alien franchise yet, jump the shark and go buy the complete collection, it is cheap and you are sure to spend couples of hours watching one of the best movie ever made. Of course, you will have to forgive the lack of FXs... Obviously, the story is so good and the plot so immersive that you will not take heed of such a lack. Try it!

Not that long ago, but long enough where 3-D movies were still an attraction, and were around to go to on special occasions or once in a while. Now that they're everywhere and every movie is in 3-D, movies like this one would most likely not be funded because there are big budget 3-D films out there that could make a fortune, and people will definitely go to see them instead of this. And really, this isn't even a very good movie, but, the 3-D is the best I've ever seen, and far superb to 3-D films I've seen even recently. The story isn't great, and the plot is pretty muddled, but this film is a vessel to show off amazing 3-D effects, and as a 3-D vessel, this is pretty darn impressive.The story follows a young man named Johnny, whose father just passed away. Johnny goes to a castle his dad left him and meets Mr. D (voiced by Harry Shearer of the Simpsons), who is actually the Devil. Johnny wants to be a rock and roll star, like his father was, so naturally Satan wants him to sell his soul. Following the basic plot is a string of special effect scenes, which make up 80% of the movie.This movie, as a film, probably deserves about a 3\/10. I would never watch this on home video, unless the new 3-D TV's did this thing justice to make it as amazing as it was in Imax. As a 3-D movie, I'd give it a 10.

Batman and Robin is laughably poor, and I mean that in the most literal sense imaginable. I honestly couldn't control my bursts of hysterics when it came to some of the cheesier and most cringe-worthy moments. I'm not going to lie, the cast is pretty solid, but they all seem as though they're in the complete wrong movie. Most of those actors in like an all-stars film or something, is something I'd be interested to see. I'll talk more about this later, but really the casting is one area that is a particular downfall as far as Batman movies go. Looking back on my list of pros and cons, I was hugely surprised by the incredible amount of positive things I had written down about this movie, considering my overall impressions. I knew I'd been writing them as I went a long, and so obviously wasn't completely keeping track of everything I put, because I was trying to concentrate on the film at the same time. It was only when I realised that at least five of my pros had the words 'Alicia' and 'Silverstone' in them, that it started making sense. In all fairness though, you can't blame me.So the plot line. My question is what plot line? There definitely is one, but it's so confused, random and complex that even I couldn't cope. I mean hell, I understood what was happening, but I didn't have a clue Why it was happening. It was all just a hapless mishmash of completely unrelated sub-plots that apparently are somehow connected; yet this is in the craziest, most non-sensical ways imaginable. Somehow every single one of these manic and ridiculous plot-threads is geniously interwoven. I have to say, the writer deserves props for that, because it would have taken either a total genius, or a complete off-the-wall, asylum-bound retard to piece the puzzle together quite the way they did. Then again, simply watching this film makes you feel like a complete off-the-wall, asylum-bound retard, so I guess in that respect it really does capture the true spirit of Batman.Back on the subject of the cast, I think they could've done worse, but as I said, they don't really scream out BATMAAAAAAAN. George Clooney and Arnold Schwarzenegger are on usual ass-kicking meets great acting form; Chris O'Donnell plays the whiny little bitch well; Uma Thurman is a little over the top (I mean I know Poison Ivy is meant to be over the top, but in some places she just takes it a bit too far); and Alicia Silverstone is... Alicia Silverstone. Nuff said. However I did have some problems with the cast other than the Poison Ivy bit I mentioned Commissioner Gordon just doesn't seem right; Mr Freeze won't stop spouting one-liners and puns, which I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad one; and although George Clooney makes a decent Batman, some segments just take the 'family friendly' nature of the movie a bit too far, with such infamous moments as the bat credit card scene just being overly cheesy. I don't know\/care who plays Bane, but the overall look, and performance just sucks. I'm just gonna lay it down, no fluff... it sucks. Although thankfully, this movie can say that it has John Glover in its cast (which it does), which, although his appearance is lamentably brief, is sort of a saving grace. Seeing Lionel Luthor (Smallville) in yet another comic related thing is awesome. Another thing that got me is when did Barbara Gordon become Barbara Pennyworth?That was my main problem with this movie the sheer 'cheese factor'. Some of the fight-scenes were just far too badly done, although there is a fairly decent fight with Bane near the end. Most of the fighting just isn't that well choreographed in my opinion, and just enhances the overall cheesiness.One particular scene that really got to me was the one right at the beginning where Mr Freeze is stealing the diamond from the museum. The whole hockey thing. Just didn't impress me, and it really didn't give me a good impression of what was to come, although it does adequately set the tone for the rest of the movie. I must say Poison Ivy and Mr Freeze's escape from Arkham is fairly epic, and that part actually did impress me. Another thing that didn't though, were some of the sound effects. The cartoony *phwiiiiiing*, and such really don't fit with the rest of the movie, and the tone it's trying to set. I mean, as far as I'm aware, this movie is actually trying to take itself seriously - amazingly. So the cartoon style sound effects just don't work.The music was decent, true Batman type stuff, although Danny Elfman's scores will always take the forefront in my mind.Overall, this movie was better than I'd expected. I'd heard some really awful things about it, and whereas it really is a poor piece of cinema, I don't quite think the hate is entirely warranted. Some parts of the story are actually pretty good, and the end is really quite touching... and then they ruin it by doing a slow-mo run with capes billowing in the wind. THE END WAS GOING SO WELL. I was like, thank God it's ditched what has been an ever present feature in this movie to revert to some traditional story-telling... oh no wait, Batman, Robin and Batgirl running, spotlit in slow-motion, their capes blowing behind them. What a way to spoil the end of a movie! Couldn't they have just rolled the freaking credits? Either way, this film is bad, but still not something that's complete bargain bin trash.

However I did have some problems with the cast other than the Poison Ivy bit I mentioned Commissioner Gordon just doesn't seem right; Mr Freeze won't stop spouting one-liners and puns, which I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad one; and although George Clooney makes a decent Batman, some segments just take the 'family friendly' nature of the movie a bit too far, with such infamous moments as the bat credit card scene just being overly cheesy. I don't know\/care who plays Bane, but the overall look, and performance just sucks. I'm just gonna lay it down, no fluff... it sucks. Although thankfully, this movie can say that it has John Glover in its cast (which it does), which, although his appearance is lamentably brief, is sort of a saving grace. Seeing Lionel Luthor (Smallville) in yet another comic related thing is awesome. Another thing that got me is when did Barbara Gordon become Barbara Pennyworth?That was my main problem with this movie the sheer 'cheese factor'. Some of the fight-scenes were just far too badly done, although there is a fairly decent fight with Bane near the end. Most of the fighting just isn't that well choreographed in my opinion, and just enhances the overall cheesiness.One particular scene that really got to me was the one right at the beginning where Mr Freeze is stealing the diamond from the museum. The whole hockey thing. Just didn't impress me, and it really didn't give me a good impression of what was to come, although it does adequately set the tone for the rest of the movie. I must say Poison Ivy and Mr Freeze's escape from Arkham is fairly epic, and that part actually did impress me. Another thing that didn't though, were some of the sound effects. The cartoony *phwiiiiiing*, and such really don't fit with the rest of the movie, and the tone it's trying to set. I mean, as far as I'm aware, this movie is actually trying to take itself seriously - amazingly. So the cartoon style sound effects just don't work.The music was decent, true Batman type stuff, although Danny Elfman's scores will always take the forefront in my mind.Overall, this movie was better than I'd expected. I'd heard some really awful things about it, and whereas it really is a poor piece of cinema, I don't quite think the hate is entirely warranted. Some parts of the story are actually pretty good, and the end is really quite touching... and then they ruin it by doing a slow-mo run with capes billowing in the wind. THE END WAS GOING SO WELL. I was like, thank God it's ditched what has been an ever present feature in this movie to revert to some traditional story-telling... oh no wait, Batman, Robin and Batgirl running, spotlit in slow-motion, their capes blowing behind them. What a way to spoil the end of a movie! Couldn't they have just rolled the freaking credits? Either way, this film is bad, but still not something that's complete bargain bin trash.

The death of Spock (Nimoy) following the battle with Khan left the perfect storyline to follow, as fans would be lining up for the possibility of seeing everyone's favorite Vulcan return. It is discovered that Spock's mind-meld with Dr. McCoy (Kelley) left his katra, his spirit, cohabiting the doctor's mind. Spock voices his request to Kirk through McCoy that he must return to the Genesis planet, formed at the end of II when the Genesis device detonated inside the USS Reliant and the Mutara Nebula. With the Enterprise being decommissioned and the Genesis planet declared forbidden to access, Kirk makes a bold decision and his crew joins him in stealing the Enterprise from space dock to return his best friend's katra to the Genesis planet and ultimately to his home planet Vulcan. Unfortunately, a group of rogue Klingons have gained knowledge of the Genesis device and seek it's secret for its destructive properties.THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK isn't as good as STAR TREK II, but it's still better than THE MOTION PICTURE. The film regains some of the mellow spirituality of the first film while continuing to integrate the action and humor that made the show so fun. My problem with the film was that it bounced between these two qualities and gave the film's pace a stop-and-go feel. The movie moves in bursts of excitement punctuated with long sequences that at times bored me. For example, the final act of the film where the crew arrives at Vulcan with Spock's rapidly matured new physical body was a drawn out ceremony where I found myself checking the time and waiting for it to end. My interest had waned as soon as the movie's main action had ended. The best moments are when everything's moving at an exciting pace as Kirk and his crew hijack the Enterprise or battle the Klingon Bird-of-Prey. I should also mentioned I loved the bar scene near the beginning where McCoy, losing his mind, enters a bar seeking transport to the Genesis planet. You can tell they found their inspiration from the cantina scene in A NEW HOPE and it was a fun sequence giving more screen time to my all-time favorite original series character.The film marks Leonard Nimoy's first time directing a feature film, and I don't think he did too bad. He certainly did the best he could with a story that wasn't the strongest to begin with. It's a shame that even Nimoy himself couldn't wrangle a powerful enough performance out of William Shatner here. It's not that I don't like Shatner's work (he is and always will be the best Kirk there could ever have been), but I have seen now that he has limitations. In this film, Kirk experiences some heavy losses (both pretty crucial plot points that I don't want to spoil here in the event a reader hasn't seen the film) and, while they should've been moments for a heavy dramatic moment, I never felt it. When the Klingons decide to execute a particular captive to prove their seriousness, I never felt the weight of the loss through Shatner's performance. A brief flicker and then BAM, back to the action. It cheapened what could've been a great character moment for the starship captain who's always seemed so invincible. Too bad, it just falls a little flat.Despite Shatner's performance shortcomings in the film, most everything else came together well. Robin Curtis replaced Kirstie Alley as Saavik (I guess her sitcom star status went to her head by this point) and does a well enough job filling her position. But while they lost one TV sitcom comedians, they gained two more Christopher Lloyd and John Larroquette as Klingons. Lloyd is the film's main villain, the Klingon commander Kruge. He actually does a great job and is probably one of the better villains from the movie series, even if it did take me a while to stop associating the voice with Doc Emmett Brown. Speaking of Klingons, the film also introduces my favorite STAR TREK spacecraft the Klingon Bird-of-Prey. I've always loved the design and any chance to see it in action is a treat for me.When the movie is over, I'm happy to say the good outweighs the bad. It has some real slow bits but the parts that standout in my mind are only the best, and it leaves me with an overall good impression. While I'll not say it's the best STAR TREK film, it does have some important moments in series history and it isn't a bad way to spend two hours.

However; underneath the gruesome images and complete lack of moral fiber from the main character, Ben played by Benoît Poelvoorde, this movie has some really hilarious parts. For me this is a black comedy with some genuine horror mixed in.Ben, our star, is a charismatic serial killer who has agreed to a documentary film that showcases his motives, desires and actual killings. He explains how going after elderly people is best because they put up less of a fight and that Postmen are his favorite targets. Ben discusses classical music, architecture and philosophy all while murdering random people. After a while, Ben brings the film crew further into his world than they had ever wanted to go. Along the way learning about his interests and witnessing the random killings, even becoming part of the action so to speak.Director, Rémy Belvaux did a great job and I think it was smart to film in B&W.

Luckily for us, the gore isn't as impactful due to the black and white. Thankfully, this adheres to the A Killer Comedy tag-line and further pushes the comedy aspect.What makes Man Bites Dog so powerful is this roller coaster of emotions.

It sort of takes away a bit of your humanity. You are almost ashamed to have laughed at all. After the two main brutal scenes the film reverts back to it's black comedy base.

It sort of takes away a bit of your humanity. You are almost ashamed to have laughed at all. After the two main brutal scenes the film reverts back to it's black comedy base. At the end I felt like I had been through a very stressful experience yet I loved every minute of it.The film is wonderfully acted and the script is great. There were many times that I was questioning whether this was real or not. A testament to all involved. Man Bites Dog is a brilliant film, you have NEVER seen anything like it.

This is the kind of movie that Last Action Hero wants to be. Danny's hero is the character of Jack Slayer played by Arnold Swartzenegger. Hollywood is about to release the fourth entry in the Slayer series. Danny's projectionist friend has access to a copy of the film, and he offers to give Danny a private screening. A stroke of magic takes Danny into the movie itself, where he becomes Slayer's partner. Together they are going after a notorious drug lord in LA.So long as it sticks to self parody, Last Action Hero is watchable. dozens of cars (and one ice cream truck) explode in impossible ways, people go flying through mid air, off buildings, across rooms like there is no gravity in the movie, Slayer has more guns and ammo in his glove compartment than is physically possible, and for reasons he cannot figure out, he can't bring himself to say the 'f' word (because as Danny tries to point out, it's a PG-13 movie)And it's not just Action movies that get a comedic treatment, We have jokes from Amadeus, Witness, and The Seventh Seal. It's curious how an eleven year old boy can know so much about movies which he'd be too young to get into. Despite its ability to wink at itself, Last Action Hero still feels at a loss. It never quite rises about the stuff it mocks, because it still feels like a b-movie experience. And this isn't even the worst problem.Eventually, director John McTiernan takes the fight out of the movie world and back into the real world. It is here where Last Action Hero crumbles. It's astonishing how long it takes to end. The fluidity and humour just about vanish. The appearance of Slayer at the premier of his movie is amusing, but I found myself getting bored really fast. Another problem is that Swarzenegger and Austin O'Brien, don't make a good pair. Swarzenneger gets good one liners but like most action heroes he delivers them all the same way, and O'Brian acts like he is only half involved in the movie.The Last Action hero is good for a few laughs early on, but it gets carried away, and the finished project feels too clumsy and unbalanced to recommend.

I had been into silent movies for a couple of years, but hadn't had the opportunity to see Fritz Lang's classic. I finally saw it at a silent movie theater in Hollywood, and my feelings were, to say the least, mixed.The film is visually stunning. Monumental sets, brilliantly directed scenes, amazing special effects (by the standards of the time). In fact, I might say that I was more enthralled by the visual effects of this movie than I was by say, Lord of the Rings or Avatar. Whereas Cameron and Jackson used CGI to make their visions come true; Lang had to use camera trickery, paint, and wood.This movie no doubt set the lexicon for the Sci-Fi and blockbuster genre in stone. The images of Metropolis have been repeated in innumerable movies. The scene of the underground city being flooded has curious similarities to James Cameron's Titanic. Even the villainous Rotwang can be seen in the characters, Dr. Strangelove and Doc Brown from Back to the Future.But then there's the story. And the dialogue. And the acting (which is overwrought, even by the standards of the time. But I don't have enough room to go into that.)Starting with the opening line Look---These are your brothers, a violent cringe would run through my body every time the intertitles would appear.The later line about the head and hands needing the heart as mediator caused a huge outburst of laughter in the theater. This serves as the basis for the moral of the story, which was eerily similar to How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Essentially, it can boiled down to this Somebody (according to writer, Thea von Harbou's later beliefs, this turned out to be Adolf Hitler) needs to appeal to the hearts of capitalist managers and tell them to be nice to their workers. The outcome is a grudging handshake between the head manager, Joh Frederson, and the leader of the workers, Grot; and thus begins a shining new day!Metropolis also incorporates religious symbolism which is, to say the very least, heavy-handed. Scenes of the Seven Deadly Sins, The Tower of Babel, an altar to Moloch, and the Flood all warn of doom to decadent societies that exploit the weak and kill the righteous.In the end, this muddled mixture of Socialist calls for justice, and Christian Apocalypticism creates a political message that Lang himself described as silly.I recommend this film for its artistic brilliance and groundbreaking techniques. But don't go into this expecting an award quality film.If you want to get into silent film, this is a relatively easy one to get start with. However, I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing.

This shows that Boogie is proud of who he is and of where he came from.Not only does this movie focus on the search for oneself, but it also focuses on several aspects of racism and ethnocentricity.

For one, the story ends up being told from a woman's (Beth) perspective. The cinematography by Driver is also very expressive and there's much to analyze from just one scene. The opening scene where we see the billboard resembles that scene of perfection but then as we zoom out we get reality. We've seen this scene many times before in other movies like What's Cooking. However, the real impact of the film came with Grace's rape and thus suicide. It is truly tragic because poverty is not what is keeping this Maori family from being able to move on, it's the loss of cultural identity and really education\/guidance. The last thing I admired about this movie is the violence. The violence is not gratuitous and serves its purpose. It is straightforward and natural even to the point that it is uncomfortable to watch, but the rawness of it is fresh and rather liberating.

One of life's more satisfying emotions come to life in such grandiose fashion in this film. One thing that all great movies share in my opinion is yes a great story, but more specifically, one in which the audience is able to feel for. Tarrantino did this very well with Inglorious Bastards by taking the audience onto a ride throughout the film and finally arriving at a stop where everybody is laughing and feeling overjoyed watching Nazis being murdered. Same is done in this film. The story can be slow at variations in this film but the build up to certain scenes is what creates the 'epicness' (sorry to use this word) of the film. WIthout going into details of the film, the audience is dragged through the lead characters tragic happenings and is finally capable of embarrassing the sweet taste of revenge, alongside Jim Caviezel. Everybody can relate to strong sentiment of revenge. It's a great carnal feeling that everybody exhibits on some level. It's human nature, and when a story can display its true grit and emancipation, it makes for one heck of a movie.Once you parlay the storyline and such with the great cast of actors, you are bound for something special, never mind the fact that the movie is based on a novel masterpiece in Alexandre Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo. Caviezel and Pierce play great counterparts in this film and as both friends and bitter rivals, they balance each other out quite beautifully. I really enjoyed watching these two face each other throughout the movie.The film deals with many interesting themes that can lead to great discussion. The idea of redemption is integral not only to the tale of revenge, but plays well within the overriding theme of religion which is made clear to the audience on several occasions. God will give me justice, as is often recanted in the film provides great servitude to the idea of never giving up and always looking forward. It's an aspect of the film that provides closure to the film once revenge has been served and justice has been replaced. Friendship was very important to me as I viewed the film, not only through the relationship of the two main characters, but more importantly in the importance of friendship and how such underlings can lead people out of obscurity and can help others along in their paths. The friendship between Edmund and the pirate is fantastic and really shows its pure strenght.

Friendship was very important to me as I viewed the film, not only through the relationship of the two main characters, but more importantly in the importance of friendship and how such underlings can lead people out of obscurity and can help others along in their paths. The friendship between Edmund and the pirate is fantastic and really shows its pure strenght. Finally the friendship that is created by Edmund and the priest inside the prison leads both out of obscurity and into salvation.Stop reading and go watch it!!!

One of the most authentic films ever made. I guess at the date of release on a lot of movies, and am usually within 2 or 3 years. But I was off by 5 years, and the Hoffman film with a colossal cast of supporting actors was in theaters in 1967. Totally and thoroughly enjoyed this movie which felt like a cultural predecessor of the me era. If Mrs. Robinson(Elaine's mother) was not the epitome of a selfish, sad, hateful and probably scorned woman, I don't know who ever was. I don't think any of the assorted cast from Bewitched were that way(there were several at the party at the hotel). I get the idea that the Robinsons were loaded and Ben's family was not. It was difficult to grasp that concept. Shortly after coming home from school, Ben met the elder Mrs. Robinson and it looked like Ben picked up the tab for the room. This was a nice hotel. A lot of movies made at that time did not ever get transferred, and it's very cool to see the archives or things of days gone by. Like that hotel. Motels usually worked well for me in my late teens.Ben's parents see their son lounging about a few weeks after he graduates from college. They worry he will not get on with their life. Ben has a new playmate, and the arrangement is one that makes him happy despite the fact that his girlfriend\/lover has become very possessive. This emotion plays an important part later in the movie. None of the humor in The Graduate is silly or shallow. The things that Ben says to his elders is at times direct and obvious, a little ingratiating(to them) and sometimes sarcastic. Screenplay in terms of scene changes is fresh and new--nothing I see in more recent or modern movies competes well with the movie in that sense of direction. I only now see there were seven Oscar nominations and one win for Best Director. There were more than one light in the thoughtful movie besides Dustin Hoffman-- the other one who's movies have lasted are Katharine Ross, who was in Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid.

Had she been easier to work with and taken a few acting lessons she might have made movies in Hollywood earning ten times what the miserly French would pay. She does not have enough scenes here--one of this ornate and overlong film's several shortcomings.Apart from the obligatory love triangle sub-plot, the story concerns a country gentleman **cum** engineer who decides he must petition King Louis XVI, France's last absolute monarch, to obtain financial backing for his scheme to drain the swamps in his home region and so rid it of the mosquito infestation and fevers that make life there near impossible. While nearing the Royal Palace at Versailles this young man, played adequately if not electrifyingly by Charles Berling, is the victim of an eighteenth century mugging.The hero is next seen at the house of a well-connected doctor, who later agrees to take him in and instruct him in the art of witty repartee which will be his **entree** to the royal court.

Christmas Story is one of the best Christmas films around and what makes it so good is how down to earth it really is. It takes place in the golden age of Christmas, when you could say, Merry Christmas, without getting your head blown off ! It follows the holiday season with an average family from Ohio. It's nothing more complicated than that. Its just plain simplicity, but it works ! With such memorable actors and lines, Christmas Story relates to all of us. For me I'd have to say that this movie, Christmas Vacation (1989), Christmas With The Kranks (2006), & A Christmas Carol (1984) are my all time favorite Christmas movies, but this one stands out the most. Have a good Christmas ! ","genre":"Comedy, Family"}]
