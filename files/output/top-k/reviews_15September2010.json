Don't make a bit of sense to me. If that's what being crazy is, then I'm senseless, out of it, gone-down-the-road, wacko. But no more, no less, that's it.¨ R. P. McMurphy is one of my favorite movie characters and probably Jack Nicholson's best role to date (although he has had several great and memorable ones). It is as if he was destined to play this character all along, and will forever be remembered as this over energetic guy trying to help and free his fellow patients from the order, discipline, and boundaries set by his nemesis, Nurse Ratched. The movie may be criticized by a few people for not portraying psychiatric patients truthfully, but that wasn't the purpose of the story. This is a very smart tragic comedy that focuses on the struggle between a complicated free spirited man (who happens to be a criminal as well) and a very cold, over controlling, and disciplined Nurse who thinks her way is the only right way to do things. She runs the institution like a General who orders his soldiers. Her treatment doesn't seem to be helping her patients at all, and only seems to refrain them, while McMurphy's crazy, radical, and anarchic behavior actually improves their well being. A clear example of this is that Nurse Ratched is so blind and focused on doing things her way that she doesn't even realize that Billy has stopped stuttering. Maybe she did notice it, but since it wasn't accomplished by her methods she makes sure he goes back to being his usual self by blaming him for his actions. Louise Fletcher gives a terrific performance playing this cold hearted character so well; she isn't your typical villain who knows is evil and only wants to hurt people, she actually believes that she is right and that her methods are the only ones allowed. The two characters are so different from each other that they just end up complimenting their performance. The reason we love McMurphy so much is because he represents the fight against abusive authority figures, such as Nurse Ratched.For those who aren't familiar with the plot I will briefly explain it. R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) has been sentenced to prison for several assaults and a rape conviction. The guards have doubts whether or not he is mad and needs mental treatment or is faking it, and therefore is sent to an institution where the doctors can analyze his behavior. Little does McMurphy know that in the ward he is placed at there is even someone more controlling than the prison guards, Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) who runs the place with absolute authority. Among the very submissive patients we have Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif), who has suicidal impulses, Harding (William Redfield) who suspects his wife cheated on him although he has no believable proof, Charlie Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), Fredrickson (Vincent Schiavelli), Taber (Christopher Lloyd), and Martini (Danny DeVito). McMurphy catches his eye however on Chief Bromden (Will Sampson) because he could be useful to him due to his big size and seems to be outside of everyone else's radar (including Nurse Ratchet) since they say he's deaf and mute. McMurphy befriends the patients, plays cards with them, basketball, talks about the World Series, and tries to teach them a thing or two about being men (he even finds a way of taking them fishing). He defies the Nurse's authority and makes a bet with the rest of the patients that he can put an end to her daily hospital routines and break her, but when McMurphy realizes that in the institution he doesn't have a release date like he would have at prison he tries to find a way to escape.One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a classic that has enjoyed success ever since its debut in 1975 , and it continues to be beloved by movie fans around the world today (it ranks at #9 on the IMDb Top 250 Films of all time). It was actually only the second film to date to win the grand slam of Oscars Best direction (Milos Forman), Best Actor (Jack Nicholson), Best Actress (Louise Fletcher), Best Screenplay (Lawrence Hauben and Bo Goldman), and Best Picture (Saul Zaentz and Michael Douglas). The screenplay was adapted from Ken Kesey's novel and he wrote after his own personal experience when he volunteered to work at a Veteran Hospital in California. The screenplay took a different approach (so much so that Kesey sewed the film and has refused to watch the final cut,) in the novel the Chief narrates the story. The film will be remembered for its very memorable characters, and there are several great scenes in the movie (when McMurphy narrates the imaginary World Series game to the guys, when he takes them fishing, his confrontations with Nurse Ratchet), but it will also be esteemed for the very climatic and powerful ending. This is truly a great film and has stood the test of time.

But Dalton was totally frustrated this time & he finally announced that he wont return as 007. Many fans were upset with his decision & even me. Pierce Brosnan try's to fit into his shoes in Goldeneye, but he doesn't.In my opinion this the best bond venture till date, strong script, best action sequences. bond girl, gadgets & most important the director Martin Campbell. The writers wrote this movie's script with Timothy Dalton as 007 in their mind, his dark, strong & deadliest part as James Bond, which Pierce toke fully advantage. Hate it!!!!!!! The movie has been directed outstandingly from the opening scene at the dam till the climax. This time 006 as villain gosh what a script, i remember i was just 8 years old when i first saw this movie in theater's actually my first bond movie in theater, didn't understood but i completely enjoyed it. The movie has the best score which is conducted by Eric Serra which many people dislikes it. Strange. Eric Serra brings the modern music with the basic touch of bond theme, specially in the opening sequence when bond is in the Russian chemical factory, the back ground score played that time grips the movie firmly & the plane jump totally thrills me till today. Pierce Brosnan gets the full advantage from the script which was Timothy's originally. It can been seen clearly the image of Timothy as 007 in this movie. The way Pierce walks his looks, the way he dresses up totally shows dark side of Timothy Dalton. If this movie would have done by Timothy Dalton i can bet that he would have done another bond venture & he would have declared the best bond which many people underrated him. The role of leading bond girl Natalya Simonova one of the best bond girls in the bond series, & Miss Onatopp play's her role wonderfully. Sean Bean as 006 does his job perfectly. General Ourumov probably the best Russian general in the entire bond series.Goldeneye was the movie which the fans were waiting for since 5 years. If we look at all the adventures of Pierce Brosnan as James bond leaving Goldeneye aside, Tomorrow never dies didn't stand upto the mark & also the movie was completely nowhere when the rival Titanic was released same time TND was released. Next The world is not enough is said the worst bond movie, lastly Die another day which was totally a remake of Moonraker & mostly Diamonds are forever, which wasn't that good movie too. So only Goldeneye kept Pierce as 007 for the next 3 movies, in which he made a complete mess. A film which belonged to Timothy Dalton will always be his but played by another one.Goldeneye bring back the real bond without the real bond, in fact the worst bond. I wanted to rate this movie 10\/10 but i wont, because Timothy Dalton didn't played 007 for this movie as it was his.MY RATING 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 September 2010","score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" The year 1991 Timothy Dalton was making a return for his third venture as 007 for The property of a lady, but copyright issue's declined the make of property of lady.

The movie has the best score which is conducted by Eric Serra which many people dislikes it. Strange. Eric Serra brings the modern music with the basic touch of bond theme, specially in the opening sequence when bond is in the Russian chemical factory, the back ground score played that time grips the movie firmly & the plane jump totally thrills me till today. Pierce Brosnan gets the full advantage from the script which was Timothy's originally. It can been seen clearly the image of Timothy as 007 in this movie. The way Pierce walks his looks, the way he dresses up totally shows dark side of Timothy Dalton. If this movie would have done by Timothy Dalton i can bet that he would have done another bond venture & he would have declared the best bond which many people underrated him. The role of leading bond girl Natalya Simonova one of the best bond girls in the bond series, & Miss Onatopp play's her role wonderfully. Sean Bean as 006 does his job perfectly. General Ourumov probably the best Russian general in the entire bond series.Goldeneye was the movie which the fans were waiting for since 5 years. If we look at all the adventures of Pierce Brosnan as James bond leaving Goldeneye aside, Tomorrow never dies didn't stand upto the mark & also the movie was completely nowhere when the rival Titanic was released same time TND was released. Next The world is not enough is said the worst bond movie, lastly Die another day which was totally a remake of Moonraker & mostly Diamonds are forever, which wasn't that good movie too. So only Goldeneye kept Pierce as 007 for the next 3 movies, in which he made a complete mess. A film which belonged to Timothy Dalton will always be his but played by another one.Goldeneye bring back the real bond without the real bond, in fact the worst bond. I wanted to rate this movie 10\/10 but i wont, because Timothy Dalton didn't played 007 for this movie as it was his.MY RATING 9\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller"},{"date":"15 September 2010","score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" The year 1991 Timothy Dalton was making a return for his third venture as 007 for The property of a lady, but copyright issue's declined the make of property of lady. The issue lasted for 5 years, Dalton was about to return for this time, but he didn't the reason United Artist disturbed him a lot by making stupid excuses that he would return as soon possible before his contract expires. At last it ended after 5 years but Timothy's contract expired, & yet it was in the news that his contract would be renewed due to copyright issues lasted tooooo long. But Dalton was totally frustrated this time & he finally announced that he wont return as 007. Many fans were upset with his decision & even me. Pierce Brosnan try's to fit into his shoes in Goldeneye, but he doesn't.In my opinion this the best bond venture till date, strong script, best action sequences. bond girl, gadgets & most important the director Martin Campbell. The writers wrote this movie's script with Timothy Dalton as 007 in their mind, his dark, strong & deadliest part as James Bond, which Pierce toke fully advantage. Hate it!!!!!!!

It's one of the movies that people identify with him. Hitchcock is known for spellbinding his audience. In Psycho, Marion Crane eats her last supper with someone more neurotic and unbalanced than herself. In Vertigo, Scotty and Judy begin an affair that makes them dizzy, obsessive, neurotic and filled with revelations.Hitchcock's style uses the camera to imitate a person's gaze and forces viewers to be there as an event is unfolding. He framed shots to maximize the audience's anxiety, fear and empathy. He used innovative film editing. He had a love for the technical side of film making. The suspense in The Birds will keep you on the edge of your seat. It is scarier when there are no birds to be seen, but you hear them shrieking and gawking in the distance and in the trees. There is the tension, the silence, and the mystery. This is suspense for the lovers of suspense.In this movie there is no bad guy, no car chases and no serial murderers. The main plot is Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren); a young rich girl goes to Bodega Bay to pursue her new attraction. She is bringing two love birds to give to Mitch Brenner's (Rod Taylor) 11 year-old sister. She had recently met him in San Francisco and wanted to get to know him better. He spends the weekends in this small town with his mom and sister. The suspense begins to build as you watch the birds standing, watching and waiting. The crows on the monkey bar sitting in a row is very mysterious. Something tells you they are thinking with those little beady eyes. Almost as if they are planning their strategy.Melanie finds herself trapped with Mitch and his family inside their home. His mother, Lydia (Jessica Tandy) and sister, Cathy (Veronica Cartwright. We see the birds gather and attack in increasing ferocity. The small town is battered and torn. The bird's presence is dark and scary. Sound imitating bird shrieks are so high pitched and awful you can barely hear yourself think. Everyone inside the house is twisting and turning in reaction to their fury and imagining their own horrible deaths at the beaks and talons of these creatures. Melanie goes up the stairs because she hears a rustling noise; we all know what lies on the other side of the door, nothing nice. Melanie is attacked and gets trapped on the other side of the door. Mitch tries to get inside but finds he cannot because Melanie has her back to the door and are too busy fighting off birds. She slumps and surrenders to the birds, her face shows a combination of horror and defeat. If you are wishing for a happy ending-don't watch this one. Final scene, Hitchcock looks and winks at the camera. The characters are excellent, the support cast who has only a few lines does an excellent job of fighting off birds and screaming. The famous editing techniques by Hitchcock are very obvious in each scene. Overall, this is a great black and white horror movie. It is a perfect example of why Alfred Hitchcock is considered, one of the best in the suspense business.

The directing is A+, Mel Gibson did as perfect of a job as you can do with all the camera-work and cuts, which is really something considering he was the lead role. He also gave an awesome performance as William Wallace. Saying Braveheart is historically inaccurate is nonsense, really; the true life of Wallace has nothing to do with this movie. That is not that hard a concept. When critiquing Braveheart I find two very minor flaws - Gibson's accent isn't the greatest, but, he's not Scottish, so I don't see that as significant, and the extras in the war scenes just suck in some scenes. You can see if you look closely that all of the combat does not appear authentic. These are the only two faults I can find, and they are rather trivial. Everything else works. The story of Braveheart is as epic as it gets, man loses true love, gets revenge on the entire country responsible and frees his homeland and its people in the process. It's presented in exquisite fashion. The pace of Braveheart is impeccable. The love scenes in the beginning in no way are sluggish. They serve as the calm before the storm. The writing is excellent in these scenes, as are the interactions between Wallace and Murron. The love story really jumps forward quickly, and you are soon thrust into warfare. Braveheart is not excessively violent. The gory moments serve their purpose and are not overstated. The overall writing of the movie is very smart. There are no unnatural moments or lines for any characters. The characters are all well portrayed. The acting is subtle and very polished. Patrick McGoohan as Longshanks was outstanding. The cinematography of Braveheart is as good as it gets; it might stand alone as the best ever in this area. The visuals are epic. The music is epic. The score of Braveheart is so, so strong. It continually adds to the viewing experience throughout. The ending of Braveheart is easily the best of any film. Braveheart gives you all the emotions you could ask for and does a great job of mixing light-hearted moments within all the serious drama. No other movie matches the 'epicness' and beauty of Braveheart, thus, making it the greatest movie of all-time! Bow to Mel Gibson.!BEST MOVIE EVER!**********(Do you realize how many negative reviews there are for Braveheart that only cite the historical inaccuracies as the main reason it sucked?

The real, true life of the real William Wallace has nothing to do with Braveheart. Braveheart is a movie, a tale of fantasy!!!! Not a documentary!!! The movie Goodfellas is about real life gangsters, who really existed, but the events happened differently from how they did in real life, so does that mean Goodfellas sucks because it's historically inaccurate? Same goes for about a million other movies, take your pick. Since when were movies supposed to be history lessons? The film doesn't say 'true story' or 'based on a true story' or anything like that in the opening credits or anywhere. Oh I get it, the character's name is William Wallace so that makes it real. Ha Ha, you're entire argument 'this movie sucks because that's not what really happened' is so, so foolish. So ignorant. It holds no water, a completely stale argument. Completely erroneous. The shame is that Braveheart might be the top movie on the Top250 list if it weren't for the strong percentage of reviews saying it's historically inaccurate, but it still rates an impressive 8.4, even with all you blind-to-the-fact haters.

Like several of his other non-Python movies, this one features other members of the groundbreaking comedy team in the cast. The lead role in Jabberwocky is played by Michael Palin, and Terry Jones makes a brief appearance. The film also features a small role from Monty Python contributor (not an official Python) Neil Innes. I first this film a few years ago, and couldn't remember much from that viewing. Watching it a second time, I think it did improve somewhat, but not quite as much as I could have hoped.Set in the Dark Ages, a kingdom is terrorized the Jabberwock, a dangerous monster that kills humans! Dennis Cooper is a young cooper who lives in a village which has been left alone by this horrible creature. He is in love with Griselda Fishfinger, an obese young woman who also lives in this village, but she doesn't seem to be too interested in him. On his father's deathbed, the dying man disowns his son and does not leave him with any kind words. After this, Dennis decides to leave the village and go to the city to find a new job. He intends to return after he has made his fortune and is ready to marry Griselda. Unfortunately, the young former cooper doesn't know how much trouble he is headed for on this journey! When he arrives at the entrance of the enclosed city, where people are well aware of the Jabberwock, the guards refuse to let him in, since he has nothing to offer, but he soon manages to sneak in through another door, and is in for a lot of chaos inside as he meets many different residents of this city! This comedy adventure doesn't seem that promising around the beginning, with the narration and such, though there are some mildly amusing moments. It could be funnier, and the scene with Griselda scratching her rump is a part that stands out as unfunny to me (though I've certainly seen worse). The deathbed scene made me laugh, and other early scenes might have as well, even if they weren't big laughs. The part when Dennis first comes to the entrance of the city and meets the guards might be funnier than anything that comes before it in the film, and there were many more times when I laughed during my second viewing, with the way Dennis sneaks into the city and many chaotic things that then happen while he's there. However, I also found the story for Jabberwocky to be somewhat dull and tedious. The film can also be a little hard to follow at times, and maybe a bit too noisy as well. Unfortunately, the laughs are not quite consistent enough to completely make up for the severe flaws.This movie was made in between two hit Monty Python films, Monty Python and the Holy Grail and Life of Brian. Because of that and the fact that the director and lead actor were both members of that highly influential comedy troupe, it's obviously hard not to compare Jabberwocky to the work of Monty Python, even if it's not quite the same idea. Even after seeing it twice, I still can't say I think it's anywhere near as good as Python, as much as I know many would disagree. In my opinion, it could have used a little more focus and is fairly forgettable, even if I can remember a lot more of it after my second viewing than I could after my first. I remember within the next year or so after I first saw this film, I saw several other non-Monty Python movies from Terry Gilliam, including Brazil and Twelve Monkeys, which are much more popular than this 1977 release, and I thought those two were much better. Some Python fans might dislike Gilliam's non-Python work in general, but if you're a fan of Gilliam as a filmmaker, then this film COULD be worth watching for some good laughs. I'll just say that you MIGHT not want to expect it to be one of his greatest films.

","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy"},{"date":"15 September 2010","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This 1977 medieval comedy film, a largely extended version of Lewis Carroll's poem, Jabberwocky, was the first full-length movie directed solely by Terry Gilliam, after years of working as a member of the Monty Python comedy troupe, and he has gone on to direct a number of others since this one. Like several of his other non-Python movies, this one features other members of the groundbreaking comedy team in the cast. The lead role in Jabberwocky is played by Michael Palin, and Terry Jones makes a brief appearance. The film also features a small role from Monty Python contributor (not an official Python) Neil Innes. I first this film a few years ago, and couldn't remember much from that viewing. Watching it a second time, I think it did improve somewhat, but not quite as much as I could have hoped.Set in the Dark Ages, a kingdom is terrorized the Jabberwock, a dangerous monster that kills humans! Dennis Cooper is a young cooper who lives in a village which has been left alone by this horrible creature. He is in love with Griselda Fishfinger, an obese young woman who also lives in this village, but she doesn't seem to be too interested in him. On his father's deathbed, the dying man disowns his son and does not leave him with any kind words. After this, Dennis decides to leave the village and go to the city to find a new job. He intends to return after he has made his fortune and is ready to marry Griselda. Unfortunately, the young former cooper doesn't know how much trouble he is headed for on this journey! When he arrives at the entrance of the enclosed city, where people are well aware of the Jabberwock, the guards refuse to let him in, since he has nothing to offer, but he soon manages to sneak in through another door, and is in for a lot of chaos inside as he meets many different residents of this city! This comedy adventure doesn't seem that promising around the beginning, with the narration and such, though there are some mildly amusing moments. It could be funnier, and the scene with Griselda scratching her rump is a part that stands out as unfunny to me (though I've certainly seen worse). The deathbed scene made me laugh, and other early scenes might have as well, even if they weren't big laughs. The part when Dennis first comes to the entrance of the city and meets the guards might be funnier than anything that comes before it in the film, and there were many more times when I laughed during my second viewing, with the way Dennis sneaks into the city and many chaotic things that then happen while he's there. However, I also found the story for Jabberwocky to be somewhat dull and tedious. The film can also be a little hard to follow at times, and maybe a bit too noisy as well. Unfortunately, the laughs are not quite consistent enough to completely make up for the severe flaws.This movie was made in between two hit Monty Python films, Monty Python and the Holy Grail and Life of Brian. Because of that and the fact that the director and lead actor were both members of that highly influential comedy troupe, it's obviously hard not to compare Jabberwocky to the work of Monty Python, even if it's not quite the same idea. Even after seeing it twice, I still can't say I think it's anywhere near as good as Python, as much as I know many would disagree. In my opinion, it could have used a little more focus and is fairly forgettable, even if I can remember a lot more of it after my second viewing than I could after my first. I remember within the next year or so after I first saw this film, I saw several other non-Monty Python movies from Terry Gilliam, including Brazil and Twelve Monkeys, which are much more popular than this 1977 release, and I thought those two were much better. Some Python fans might dislike Gilliam's non-Python work in general, but if you're a fan of Gilliam as a filmmaker, then this film COULD be worth watching for some good laughs. I'll just say that you MIGHT not want to expect it to be one of his greatest films.

Watch Following, the no-budget thriller which was Nolan's actual directorial debut, and you begin to understand. With no money, with an amateur cast and doing pretty much everything (writing, shooting, directing) himself Nolan created a little masterpiece. Whatever it is that enables someone to make great movies Nolan clearly has it. And had it right from the beginning.Fans of Memento will see a lot of similarities, hints of what was to come, in Following. The most obvious parallel is the nonlinear time structure as the story here unfolds completely out of order. Whereas the story in Memento proceeded more or less in a straight line which just happened to be moving backwards here there is no line at all. Scenes are placed in a seemingly random order. We're all over the place. At the end, in the beginning, somewhere in the middle, back to the end again...it really could have been a jumbled mess. But Nolan gives us a little assistance in orienting ourselves with the shifting appearance of his main character. He has three distinct looks to him and once you figure that out you can figure out where you are in the story. But there are still enough twists and turns to make your head spin, to keep you guessing right up to the end.The less said about the plot the better. Best to let you try to piece the puzzle together for yourself. Much like Memento you really have to see it all the way through to fully appreciate the true genius of it, to understand how any missteps from Nolan along the way could have unraveled his whole story. When the movie concludes you can't help but be amazed that Nolan could pull this off essentially by himself. At least with Memento he had a little help. Here it's just Nolan and his small cast. There are really only three roles of any significance in the film, maybe four if you're being generous. But this little troupe and their first-time director combined to create something really special. The acting may at times seem a bit amateurish but that has to be expected from performers who are certainly not acting pros. And any little quibbles with the performances do not detract at all from the overall movie-watching experience. The actors do more than well enough to get by, well enough in fact that you're surprised there were not bigger acting roles for them somewhere down the line if they wanted them. That the performers have a great story to work with certainly helped their cause.Things do get a little convoluted in the end as Nolan's story takes its final turns. You worry that things may be getting away from him a little bit. But he manages to ultimately pull it all together. You may have to really think about it after things are through but it all makes sense when you run it back in your mind. And it's nice every now and again to have a movie that actually requires you to think isn't it? Christopher Nolan seems to specialize in movies like that. He just makes great movies. Here he did it with no money, all on his own, never having made a movie before. It takes a special talent to pull that off.

Speaking of which, there is one person that Bud really wants as a client Gordon Gekko.Gekko is THE major player on Wall Street, and Fox has tried for a couple of months to meet him. After buying Gekko a box of his favorite cigars as a birthday gift, he is granted a chance to meet the famous investor.Fox makes his pitch to Gekko, and is given a chance to prove himself, with Gekko having him make a couple of investments. One of those investments does not work out, and Gekko decides that he and Fox cannot do business. Fox asks for another chance, and Gekko then proceeds to tell him the Gordon Gekko way of doing business. If Fox can follow that, Gekko will give him another chance.After thinking about it, Fox decides to play by Gekko's rules, and works his way up to being Gekko's right-hand man, getting everything he has dreamed of. However, will it come with a price? This is another example of a movie that is good with just a decent script and fine acting.

In truth, the extra weeks haven't deadened or weakened my extremely high opinion of this certified classic. I confess that black-and-whites aren't my normal area of preference but Film 4 has a habit of showing amazing and largely forgotten films during the day so when I spotted this, I took the plunge and enjoyed this dark, twisted fable on the perils of fame and the fickle nature of the Hollywood machine.Washed-up screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) is struggling to survive in Hollywood, outwitting the various loan-sharks after him. During one such escape, he finds himself stranded at the tumbledown mansion of former silent movie star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and her loyal butler Max (Erich von Stroheim). After befriending Joe and convincing him to work on a rewrite of her own script, Joe senses the opportunity to use the situation to his advantage. But as Joe falls ever deeper under Norma's influence, he begins to find himself alienated from his own friends until he starts to fall for is friend's fiancé Betty (Nancy Olson)...Being both ground-breaking in its portrayal of Hollywood's film making process as well as its subject matter, Sunset Boulevard is such an accessible film in ways that most modern films aren't. On one hand, it is a classic film noir but it's also a biting satire on movie-making in general, the first film showing audiences the action beneath the scenes. At other times, it becomes a disturbing horror film especially when the tyrannical Norma Desmond is tipped over the edge, leering at the camera like a vampire in make-up. This is largely down to Swanson's performance, being both suitably melodramatic and dominating the film as she should. Not to say that the others don't perform as well or any of the cameos which fans of early movies will delight in. Most films, when they try to be many things at once, struggle to fit their brief but such is the feeling of Sunset Boulevard that you never get the feeling that anything was missed. This is one of the most complete films I have ever seen - even my favourite films have something I could criticise if I was being picky. But there is very little not to like about this movie - like most film noirs, you need to stick with it and pay attention but the rewards are quite remarkable.It's difficult to imagine how much of an impact this would have made in 1950 but even today, Sunset Boulevard is a film that everyone should watch. It's chilling and amusing in equal measures, being a powerful fable about the effects of fame and power which I felt was still relevant today. It truly is a timeless piece of movie-making, one which is actually deserving of the praise heaped upon it back then and today. It's bold, brave and utterly magnificent.

On one hand, it is a classic film noir but it's also a biting satire on movie-making in general, the first film showing audiences the action beneath the scenes. At other times, it becomes a disturbing horror film especially when the tyrannical Norma Desmond is tipped over the edge, leering at the camera like a vampire in make-up. This is largely down to Swanson's performance, being both suitably melodramatic and dominating the film as she should. Not to say that the others don't perform as well or any of the cameos which fans of early movies will delight in. Most films, when they try to be many things at once, struggle to fit their brief but such is the feeling of Sunset Boulevard that you never get the feeling that anything was missed. This is one of the most complete films I have ever seen - even my favourite films have something I could criticise if I was being picky. But there is very little not to like about this movie - like most film noirs, you need to stick with it and pay attention but the rewards are quite remarkable.It's difficult to imagine how much of an impact this would have made in 1950 but even today, Sunset Boulevard is a film that everyone should watch. It's chilling and amusing in equal measures, being a powerful fable about the effects of fame and power which I felt was still relevant today.

In truth, the extra weeks haven't deadened or weakened my extremely high opinion of this certified classic. I confess that black-and-whites aren't my normal area of preference but Film 4 has a habit of showing amazing and largely forgotten films during the day so when I spotted this, I took the plunge and enjoyed this dark, twisted fable on the perils of fame and the fickle nature of the Hollywood machine.Washed-up screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) is struggling to survive in Hollywood, outwitting the various loan-sharks after him.

It's not that it's a bad film (it isn't), but it's because the style is so unlike the rest of his work and the film is amazingly slow. The casual viewer might easily give up early on, as it is a difficult film to love. But, if you are able to get past this, it's a very rewarding film.This film is set in remote areas of the far Eastern portion of Russia about a decade before the Revolution. A group of soldiers have been sent there to explore and document the region and it's clear that they are a bit out of their element in the bleak steppes. Fortunately for the men, they meet up with a nomad named 'Dersu Uzala'--a guy who has wandered this region his entire life. I say fortunate because Uzala has a lot of experience and wisdom. His know-how is able to save the men and aid their journey repeatedly. The contrast between the man and the rest of the group is striking--and not just for the physical differences between them but because of Uzala's unusual animistic beliefs. And, when Uzala leaves to go his own way, the men are sad to see him go and are filled with admiration for this odd but likable man. Fortunately, he does return later and once again, his wisdom saves the men on repeated occasions.Later, the Captain from the expedition brings Uzala home with him. However, Uzala cannot cope with the city--it is just too foreign. It's obvious he's miserable and wants to return to the East. Uzala leaves and soon he's found dead--and the film ends on a very sad note.The film definitely has scope and you can't help but admire Kurosawa and his Russian-Japanese crew. They obviously spent a lot of time on this movie and braved many tough days in the snow and rain. In many ways, it's reminiscent of the Lewis and Clark Expedition that explored much of the US in the very early 19th century.

And it's not secret that it spawned a genre that has produced timeless classics like Shadow of a Doubt or Psycho, as well as more contemporary classics like Silence of the Lambs and Se7en. For this we all owe M serious credit. This film is about a mysterious child murderer who terrorizes the consciences of the German people. The hunt for this mad man stretches from the police, to the common citizen, and even the common criminal. It's an interesting take (and also the first take) on public reaction to a situation as dire as this, as well as a dark look into the mind of an insane killer.This film explores many realms of psychology and how each social demographic would react to something as unimaginably terrible as murdered children. The topics prevalent in the film are very interesting to think about in retrospect but while actually viewing the film they get somewhat lost. Parts of this film seem fairly dry emotionally during the setup for major plot advancements. Towards the beginning we see the police reaction to these murderers as they crack down hard on finding who is responsible. They violate personal privacy of many people for the sake of finding this killer. This idea is most definitely present and easy to understand, but it seems to lack emotional integrity and makes me feel like it could have hit harder. I felt like this less and less as the movie progressed and by the end it finally picks up to practically be an emotional roller coaster.Where this film absolutely does not fall short is its artistic style. There are some fantastic artistic decisions made by Fritz Lang to really bring across the style of this film. M is, undoubtedly, an eerie film. It ventures into very uncomfortable places of the human mind. The film does a fantastic job at keeping you on edge and out of your comfort zone. This is accomplished mainly by the visual style of the film. Lang employs an extremely effective use of shadows to give the film its dark and mysterious air. The entire film is characterized by its subtle yet effective visuals, all put together meticulously in eerie black and white cinematography.Artistically M is brilliant. Some of the story and character development leave something to be desired, but it all works out by the thrilling conclusion of the film. It's intelligent, cynical, and unexpected. Putting this film in the perspective of its time period (the 1930's) it is most definitely way ahead of its time, and for that I can have nothing but undying respect for the film, even if there were parts that didn't suit me.

Granted, I don't think historical accuracy should make or break a film, but here, it's WAY off. It's like if a movie depicted George Washington with superhuman strength.

I loved him in Rocky, this series, the recent Expendables, and even Spy Kids 3.This is a great film from the eighties. Jerry Goldsmith created a legendary score. The cinematography was awesome. There were very good scenery shots. I would check this out if you have not already.

At first I was skeptical about how it would turn out, especially considering the era that it came from. However I was surprised to see how well together it was considering how low key technology was back then compared to today. The over acting and the music had me both laughing at the comedy and paying more attention to the serious parts, even without the spoken words from the actors. The Gold Rush kept my attention from beginning to end and made me interested in seeing more silent movies. The storyline was well put together and I can see that type of story happening even today. Overall it was a very good experience to watch this movie and I would recommend it.
