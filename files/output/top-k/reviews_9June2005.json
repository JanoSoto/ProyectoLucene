The next noteworthy scene is when Obi Wan and Anakin are standing outside of Padme's room sharing a very informative dialog. I love when Obi Wan so eloquently jumps out of Padme's window and catches the flying droid. The visuals of the city are breathtaking and the chase scene provides the first hint of some much-needed action sequences, which turn out to be few in number. The next, coming much later, is the flight sequence through the asteroid field, which could've been much more harrowing. This is preceded by the battle scene in the stadium, which was the most visually elaborate and well-written scene in the movie. The shots and sound effects of the light sabers and the guns leave nothing to the imagination. The last of what can be considered action sequences was the fight scene with Count Dooku, Obi Wan, Anakin, and Yoda. This was much less suspenseful as it was more or less predictable. All in all, these sequences were the type that was lacking in Episode I, but they still leave much to be desired.The dialog throughout between Obi Wan and Anakin is fresh and witty, though I would've liked to have seen them together more. Obi Wan using the Force on the creature in the club was hilarious and provided a touch of color. R2D2 and C3PO provided some light comic relief, somewhat reminiscent of the OT. The music is beautiful and perfect for the film, each score fitting the scene in which it appears flawlessly.And while the scenes on Tatooine are beautiful, they remain a bit slow and pointless. The writers seem to be trying frivolously to make it believable that they fall in love, but do not succeed in showing this transition. Throughout the movie, they continually reference when they saw each other last, as if it was then that they fell in love, but Anakin was just a boy, and arguably still is now, so the whole thing just feels contrived. Anakin does not know real love; he has mistaken it for lust, as evidenced by his statement, You are in my very soul, tormenting me. Stop and think, Anakin&#133;why tormenting?? Love does not torment. Something else not true to form is how Lucas set up scenes with Anakin and Padme that start to show them getting closer, but then he always cuts to something else, like he's just going 'okay, this is how they are, accept it,' and then moves on to more important things. It inhibits the audience from feeling like they're experiencing Anakin and Padme's relationship, and any further character development, as if it's enough to just infer everything. The whole 'I love you' scene towards the end was just unforgivably forced, even with as much as you want to believe in the sentiment. Honestly, it seems to me that Lucas tries to play them as simply being young and dumb, and we're supposed to let it slide for that reason, which still being reasonably young myself, I greatly resent.

I love when Obi Wan so eloquently jumps out of Padme's window and catches the flying droid. The visuals of the city are breathtaking and the chase scene provides the first hint of some much-needed action sequences, which turn out to be few in number. The next, coming much later, is the flight sequence through the asteroid field, which could've been much more harrowing. This is preceded by the battle scene in the stadium, which was the most visually elaborate and well-written scene in the movie. The shots and sound effects of the light sabers and the guns leave nothing to the imagination. The last of what can be considered action sequences was the fight scene with Count Dooku, Obi Wan, Anakin, and Yoda. This was much less suspenseful as it was more or less predictable. All in all, these sequences were the type that was lacking in Episode I, but they still leave much to be desired.The dialog throughout between Obi Wan and Anakin is fresh and witty, though I would've liked to have seen them together more. Obi Wan using the Force on the creature in the club was hilarious and provided a touch of color. R2D2 and C3PO provided some light comic relief, somewhat reminiscent of the OT. The music is beautiful and perfect for the film, each score fitting the scene in which it appears flawlessly.And while the scenes on Tatooine are beautiful, they remain a bit slow and pointless. The writers seem to be trying frivolously to make it believable that they fall in love, but do not succeed in showing this transition. Throughout the movie, they continually reference when they saw each other last, as if it was then that they fell in love, but Anakin was just a boy, and arguably still is now, so the whole thing just feels contrived. Anakin does not know real love; he has mistaken it for lust, as evidenced by his statement, You are in my very soul, tormenting me. Stop and think, Anakin&#133;why tormenting?? Love does not torment. Something else not true to form is how Lucas set up scenes with Anakin and Padme that start to show them getting closer, but then he always cuts to something else, like he's just going 'okay, this is how they are, accept it,' and then moves on to more important things. It inhibits the audience from feeling like they're experiencing Anakin and Padme's relationship, and any further character development, as if it's enough to just infer everything.

But after maybe 10 minutes, I really started appreciating the movie for what it was, a great movie about a young black boy from the Bronx who has got a real talent for writing, and a retired writer, who's afraid of the world because of the death of his brother and parents, for which he partly blames himself.The movie may start off a bit slow, but when the conversations between Jamal and William get underway, about writing and school, the movie just took me away to another reality.Rob Brown really impressed me as an actor, though from time to time he looks a little uncaring. But Sean Connery completely makes up for that little loss. He proves once again that he is a great actor.He is so convincing that I really nearly cried at the time in Madison Guarden when he loses Jamal in the crowd and just gets to a corner to cry. It really touched me.The movie has really one major location where everything takes place, and that's William's apartment, everything that makes the movie turn happens here. The relationship between Jamal and William really grows up until the point that Jamal forgets about his friend from the Bronx and nearly spends all his time with William, learning about how to write.On school he gets involved with Clair. A relationship that we, thank god, never see to the kissing end, but which is build up perfectly. Claire is the rich girl with a father in the school board he absolutely is not happy that his daughter is spending time with a poor black boy from the Bronx. Paquin may not be the greatest actress, and it showed in this movie, but she still was convincing enough to show the slow build up of the relation and the blossoming of the love between the two. A simple concept, but very good worked out.And then of course there is the point that the movie needs a happy ending and thus something that nearly spoils everything. In this case it's Prof. Crawford, who is Jamal's writing teacher. He doesn't think that a black boy from the Bronx can be writing at a level he can't even reach, and when Jamal embarrasses him in front of his class by answering every question right, he tries, and gets, his revenge. He nearly gets Jamal suspended until, of course, William interferes.It's all maybe a bit predictable, but well, a movie in which everyone loses everything isn't fun to watch. And like in a great book we all know, Lord of the Rings, William can't stay and they lived happily ever after, he leaves for his homeland Schotland and dies there of cancer, of which he never told Jamal. A not so happy, but great, and I nearly cried here as well, ending to a great movie.

For some of us, it's Bloody Mary, and for some of us, it's Jack The Ripper. No matter who the Aloysius, the story is the same Say their name five times, and they'll pop up behind you and gut you with a hook! Oh what joyous times have I had with friends with the myth. For my town, it was Rose Mary. It was a sad bit of history taking place at an abandoned church which was located about fifty yards or so from my Virgian home. They said that she was killed and then raped there, and that seeing how she died a virgin and was sent to hell not one, that Satan spat her back up to Earth to the place where she died. Kids would make up reports of people who went to the church where found miles away, gutted, with a trail of blood that lead all the way back to the church. If you say her name in the mirror five times, she'll tear out you're heart and drag it all the way to the church, so no matter where you died, there'll be a trail of blood leading to where she died. Good times, good times. Several years (and several moves I may add) later, Candyman was released. I was excited, but unfortunately never had the chance to see in it theaters. Well to all wondering, yes, there's a point to my long-winded history lesson, because years later, I was browsing through the TV tube, when to my miraculous delight, I saw Candyman, just about to start. I turned off the lights and closed all my drops, and the only light in the room was the beautifully illuminating glow of my TV screen. The screen faded from the pre-show to black, and then the marvelous orchestral score began, and in big, narrow letters the title appeared. The movie starts off simple, a high school girl invites a boy to come over one night while she baby sits her little sibling, just to have a little rocking, when the two teenagers lead up to the bathroom. The high school girl dares her hump-buddy to say the name of her town's deadly soul, Candyman, in the mirror five times. Grinning, the horny-hungry teen says the name. Candyman, Candyman, Candyman, Candyman.... Failing the challenge of the girl, he's sent downstairs to wait for her 'present'. The girl, for some unknown reason, turns to the mirror, and substituting for her 'friend's final saying, repeats the name for the fifth time. There is silence. The girl turns off the light to the bathroom, and blood splatters the camera. Wow, what wild ride I had that night. Decapatations, guttings, and dozens of cheap thrills lie before more. I embraced every minute of it, and when it was over, I walked into the bathroom, and said the name four times. Candyman, Candyman, Candyman, Candyman... Then I looked in the mirror. I opened my mouth. And I waited. I still haven't said the name for the final time. Perhaps I'll invite someone over, a 'friend', and perhaps I'll just have to dare my friend.

I embraced every minute of it, and when it was over, I walked into the bathroom, and said the name four times. Candyman, Candyman, Candyman, Candyman... Then I looked in the mirror. I opened my mouth. And I waited. I still haven't said the name for the final time. Perhaps I'll invite someone over, a 'friend', and perhaps I'll just have to dare my friend.

The plot, as you might expect, is paper thin; and it follows the story of a couple of nerds that move to a new college and immediately find themselves at the mercy of a fraternity of football 'jocks', who see fit to tease the nerds because they're nerds.This film came to my attention after the nerdy character in American Splendor gave it such high praise.

The film follows many of the staples of previous Universal offerings, except this time the film doesn't follow an already established story (like the likes of Frankenstein and Dracula did) and the location is a much more important element of the story in this film than it has been in other Universal monster movies. Director Jack Arnold puts us firmly in the Amazon jungle, and all the foliage and animal noises combine to ensure that the action is set firmly where it's supposed to be. This location effects benefits the story immensely, but it also does something more important than that - it represents a triumph over low budget, and that always impresses me. The way that the action is kept mostly in one place helps this too, as it gives the audience the impression that the scope of the film is larger than it really is. Like all good monster movies, the story is thin and easy to follow; and it basically just follows a bunch of explorers\/scientists who travel to the Amazon to do research after finding a half-man\/half fish fossil.The script and acting in the film are less than brilliant, but by the same standards; aren't bad either and certainly passable for this sort of feature. The creature itself is, of course, the star of the show and it's design is both inventive and even somewhat realistic! Of course, the monster is purely fictional so it would be impossible for it to be truly realistic; but if there was a missing link between man and amphibian, I reckon it would look something like the creature in this movie. The idea of an undiscovered creature coming from the depths of the sea, an area still largely unexplored to this day, is fascinating; and arguably more terrifying than the idea of some unknown entity coming down from space, as the sea is a big part of our own planet. The film doesn't have much in the way of depth and themes, but there is a somewhat muddled comment on the idea of hunting and taking things out of their natural habitat. On the whole; this is an excellent creature feature and one of the best films that Universal ever produced during their golden age.

Before you start, look at this titanic body of fact and take off those rose tinted glasses. The film is essentially about attempting to find a permanent escape from deep rooted unhappiness. Dr.Soran is attempting to find a refuge from the trauma of loosing his family, Picard is also in mourning having heard that the family he vehemently disliked and saw about once every 20 years has burnt to death and Kirk - poor, sweet, rotund Kirk has lost his ship, his career and his purpose. All three find solace in the Nexus, an enormous metaphor plundering its way across space, destroying those who try and use it without understanding its nature. Soran's angst in the opening sequence is at having been briefly 'touched' by the nexus and he goes through an 80 year withdrawal, instantly addicted to its pleasure inducing side-effects. If you were left in any doubt that this was a film about drugs and hard ones at that then recall the scene in which Guinan describes the stream as being like 'wrapping yourself inside pure joy, as if joy were something tangible and you could wrap yourself up in it like a blanket'. Add an expletive and you could be quoting from an Irvine Welsh novel. Data is indirectly linked with the nexus but experiences a drug of his own in the form of his emotion chip, a device that inserted into his body produces random and uncontrolled emotions ranging from joy to anger to extreme fear. Sound familiar? Christ, I half expected the Happy Mondays to walk in at some point. Of course all the stuff about exploding suns, Klingons and time travel is a mere distraction - the fact is that when you peel back the layers you're looking at a movie in which an insane scientist is prepared to kill for a new hit, the Enterprise captains nearly succumb but endure the worst kind of cold turkey that causes their ship and their life to be destroyed respectively and the cat survives, presumably just long enough to give Data Toxal Plasmosis when he finally short circuits and conks out on the floor of his quarters. A scene that I imagine for cut to secure a child friendly rating.You want to talk technicalities? Fine. Star Trek Generations is a ever so slightly turgid instalment for this fine franchise. Its primary difficulty, aside from the controversial subject matter, is the fact that it suffers from very poor pacing and an excess of very slow scenes. I imagine this may be to do with the inexperience in making a movie by those behind the camera. David Carson directed many 1st rate episodes of the television series but in adapting to a movie schedule and the greater time this allowed for perfecting each scene, he seems to have followed the logic of slowing everything down - more methodical acting please, more pause for effect, everybody just take-your-time. No problem there except that this paradoxically makes the movie feel like a t.v episode and one inferior to the best the show had to offer.

Before you start, look at this titanic body of fact and take off those rose tinted glasses. The film is essentially about attempting to find a permanent escape from deep rooted unhappiness. Dr.Soran is attempting to find a refuge from the trauma of loosing his family, Picard is also in mourning having heard that the family he vehemently disliked and saw about once every 20 years has burnt to death and Kirk - poor, sweet, rotund Kirk has lost his ship, his career and his purpose. All three find solace in the Nexus, an enormous metaphor plundering its way across space, destroying those who try and use it without understanding its nature. Soran's angst in the opening sequence is at having been briefly 'touched' by the nexus and he goes through an 80 year withdrawal, instantly addicted to its pleasure inducing side-effects. If you were left in any doubt that this was a film about drugs and hard ones at that then recall the scene in which Guinan describes the stream as being like 'wrapping yourself inside pure joy, as if joy were something tangible and you could wrap yourself up in it like a blanket'. Add an expletive and you could be quoting from an Irvine Welsh novel. Data is indirectly linked with the nexus but experiences a drug of his own in the form of his emotion chip, a device that inserted into his body produces random and uncontrolled emotions ranging from joy to anger to extreme fear. Sound familiar? Christ, I half expected the Happy Mondays to walk in at some point. Of course all the stuff about exploding suns, Klingons and time travel is a mere distraction - the fact is that when you peel back the layers you're looking at a movie in which an insane scientist is prepared to kill for a new hit, the Enterprise captains nearly succumb but endure the worst kind of cold turkey that causes their ship and their life to be destroyed respectively and the cat survives, presumably just long enough to give Data Toxal Plasmosis when he finally short circuits and conks out on the floor of his quarters. A scene that I imagine for cut to secure a child friendly rating.You want to talk technicalities? Fine. Star Trek Generations is a ever so slightly turgid instalment for this fine franchise. Its primary difficulty, aside from the controversial subject matter, is the fact that it suffers from very poor pacing and an excess of very slow scenes. I imagine this may be to do with the inexperience in making a movie by those behind the camera. David Carson directed many 1st rate episodes of the television series but in adapting to a movie schedule and the greater time this allowed for perfecting each scene, he seems to have followed the logic of slowing everything down - more methodical acting please, more pause for effect, everybody just take-your-time. No problem there except that this paradoxically makes the movie feel like a t.v episode and one inferior to the best the show had to offer. Its not framed particularly cinematic ally either, though credit must go to John A. Alonzo's excellent cinematography which certainly makes the whole thing look polished at the very least.

The plot jumps around randomly, characters are cardboard, acting is rather feeble, and it feels much longer than the 90 minutes running time.
