Unfortunately all three of Hooper's Cannon films flopped at the box office and played a part in Cannon falling apart in the late '80s. It also meant the end of Hooper's career as an A-list director. He would never make anything great or even very good again.

But, on the eve of a new Godzilla thrashing theaters, I felt the urge to see a blast from our G-Fan past. Fortunately, much of the hatred for Zilla '98 has died down (mostly due to anticipation for the upcoming redemption by Hollywood next month).While I could sit here and write volumes and volumes on 'the bad' of the film, I think it's been done to death. Instead, I'd like to focus on some of the 'good' the film had to offer (yes, there was SOME good to the film). For parents, this movie is what I could call a safe G-flick (much like the original Toho films). By this, I mean there's barely a foul word uttered, no graphic violence I can recall, and no every film's gotta have one sex scene. I felt it was safe enough for my 8 year old step-daughter to watch (yes, my step-DAUGHTER loves Godzilla! I'll make a Jedi out of her yet!).The action is over-the-top, well in line for a Godzilla movie. Lots of Godzilla stomping (away from the military), big and loud building explosions (mostly by the military), and absurd amounts of under-the-line references to other sci-fi and action films (mostly by the military). There's a lot in Zilla '98 for giant monster fans, action movie fans, and summer popcorn movie fans.As a giant monster movie, Zilla '98 works, and it works rather well. For a Godzilla film, maybe not so much. I myself have accepted it as part of the Godzilla mythology, much in the way as Halloween-III Season Of The Witch, or maybe Friday The 13th Part-V A new Beginning. It will forever be razzed as a Godzilla film. But, if you look past that, and see it more as a giant monster film, it's not half bad. In the end don't hate the monster, hate the movie.

Poor visual effects aside, this movie is just hastily cobbled together from a few half-baked ideas that aren't fully realised, with the character motivations and the way certain plot points come to fruition not making a lick of sense.I understand that 45 or so minutes of this film were left on the cutting room floor, but having both watched the deleted scenes and read the original script for the movie, I have to say that even if all of the footage had been left in this movie would still have been a mess. I appreciate the idea of a scenario where an omnipotent superhero is put against a real world crisis but the way it plays out here doesn't do the premise justice, I would have much preferred it if the world authorities were resistant to Superman's plan for worldwide disarmament and were inadvertently united in the cause to prevent his interference, but instead there is no challenge, no moral panic, no humanity, it is just bear bones bad writing. Even so I have to say that Christopher Reeve's decision to focus the film on an overt anti-nuclear war message was a mistake from the start, not to mention it instantly dates the film and makes it come across as pretentious and trying too hard to educate rather than entertain.Yes the effects are terrible, yes the lack of money shows in almost every frame, yes the film would have been better if certain scenes were left in, but despite this every problem with the film boils down to the script. A competent writer would adapt a script to better suit a reduced budget, and while it may make sense to keep the original scale of the story if the budget was cut shortly before filming but in this case the budget was cut over a year before production started! And when that happens it is the responsibility of the writer to change the story so that the scale is less important, but rather the characters and morals are the focus. This happened with Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan, the budget was severely reduced and so the director rewrote it to focus more on the characters and less on the action, and that film turned out wonderfully, why didn't that happen here?! The film is a sad end to an otherwise classic (or half classic) movie saga and unfortunately leaves Christopher Reeve, the definitive man of steel, in a bad light. While the film perhaps tops Superman III for good intentions and being a guilty pleasure, it's far from the film it should have been.

So give me a... stage where this bull here can rage and though I could fight I'd much rather recite... that's entertainment.In 1976 Martin Scorsese teamed up with Robert De Niro and screenwriter Paul Schrader to deliver what in my opinion is one of his best films Taxi Driver. That year that complex character study lost out on the Oscar to Stallone's Rocky. So what does Scorsese do next? He directs a real boxing movie with another memorable and complex character played by Robert De Niro making Rocky look like a cartoon character. Don't get me wrong, I loved Rocky, but Jake La Motta is a character that feels much more authentic. He's deeply flawed and unpleasant to be around with, but his violent temper is what made him such a successful boxer on the ring. It was actually Robert De Niro who approached Scorsese to make this film based on Jake La Motta's autobiographical book and despite hesitating to make a sports movie at first, he ended up directing what is considered by many to be the best boxing film of all time. The boxing scenes are violent and bloody, but what was most surprising for me was the way in which De Niro captured the rage and paranoia of his character off the ring. La Motta isn't a very sympathetic character and his anger and jealous outbursts led him to his ultimate downfall, but somehow there is still something redeeming about him and De Niro captured that essence perfectly in this Award winning performance. It's much more a character study than a boxing film, but Scorsese also explores Jake La Motta's bond with his brother Joey turning this into a sibling relationship study as well. Jake tries to channel his rage through boxing, but ultimately it defeats him outside of the ring destroying the relationships he has formed. Near the end there is a nice nod to Brando's On the Waterfront, which was a perfect touch by Scorsese who seems to always be in control of his craft and at the same time honoring other famous films. Raging Bull is an artistic film dealing with a difficult subject matter but it still is considered by many as the best film from the 80's. It's a near masterpiece in my opinion with another outstanding lead performance by De Niro, who was without a doubt the best actor at that time. Jake La Motta (Robert De Niro) is the raging bull who during the 40's dominated every rival inside the ring. No one could take hits like he did and despite losing a couple fights he took pride in the fact that he never went down. Jake's brother, Joey (Joe Pesci) is his sparring partner and at the same time he manages his fights so they have a very close relationship. Joey has a few connections with the mob, but Jake refuses to deal with them and wants to get a chance at the title on his own. Joey also introduces him to a fifteen year old girl named Vickie (Cathy Moriarty), whom he later marries. As the years go by, Jake defeats his opponents but the title shot keeps eluding him since he refuses to work with the mob despite Joey's connection with Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent). While Jake's professional boxing career begins to take off, his personal life takes a blow when he allows his jealousy and paranoia to take over as he fears his wife is seeing other men. Despite channeling his rage in the ring, he also takes it out in his home on his wife and brother. What at first served as his inspiration for becoming a boxing champion escalated so much that it also became his downfall and ruin. Raging Bull centers on Jake's self destructive boxing journey and it is a very complex and emotional one. In the midst of it all there is still a redemptive quality to this antihero and he accepts his punishment through personal beatings in the ring.I don't know if Scorsese would be around making movies today if it weren't for Raging Bull. Just like his lead character Jake, Scorsese was dealing with some personal demons of his own struggling with drug addiction. De Niro convinced him to make this film and somehow he channeled his addictions through his direction. Jake unsuccessfully channeled his rage in the ring, but Marty found redemption for both of them thanks to Raging Bull. The black and white cinematography is gorgeous and the performances were powerful. De Niro gives another physically demanding performance after his work in Taxi Driver and he once again is very impressive. Joe Pesci is also wonderful as he will later become a recurring actor in other Scorsese films. The chemistry between both actors in this film is really strong and they shine together on screen. The boxing scenes were really raw and violent. They are hard to watch at times, and an extreme close up of dripping blood from the rope in the ring really captured the violence that Scorsese was trying to transmit. Raging Bull is a fascinating film which explores the mind of a very emotionally disturbed man who we wouldn't want to be around with, but somehow Scorsese draws us into his mind and he absorbs us.

I'll address one popular criticism of T2, namely Arnie being the good guy. The original idea for the first film was that the Terminator's appearance would be that of a regular Joe who would just blend into a crowd as opposed to the imposing frame of the Austrian Oak (hardly a subtle infiltration unit). Robert Patrick's police officer garbed T-1000 was just that, a chameleon, a shape shifter, he could be anyone. Therein lay the threat. That image of the partially formed, chrome T-1000 coolly waking out of a flaming truck wreck left jaws on floors and the subsequent imagery of his various acts of morphing were like nothing anyone had ever seen.

Michael Biehn (a well implemented cameo in the extended version) and Earl Boen reprise their respective roles from the original.

Writer, William Wisher (he cameos as 'guy with camera in mall' fact fans) ran with an idea deleted from the original, namely Sarah's idea to go after and stop Cyberdyne Systems. Instead of portraying the man who develops Skynet as a typical driven, power-mad scientist, here Joe Morton gives us a decent family man faced with the sickening realisation that his well intentioned day job will cause mankind's extinction.

The opening to Cameron's £100 million 1991 sequel aims to set the bar and grab your attention. Then it moves into a credits sequence of a burning children's playground, a haunting view of the coming nuclear war. This theme of the end of mankind permeates the film far more than in the original. We are, after all by this point, 3 years away from nuclear annihilation (the film is set in 1994). It's as Kyle Reese says to Sarah Connor in the first of two haunting nightmare sequences, There's not much time left in the world Sarah.The beauty of Cameron's film is not just how it expands upon the scope of the original but how the film itself changed the landscape of cinema much like Jaws did back in the summer of 1975. This was a tent-pole summer blockbuster on a scale never before seen and, get this modern Hollywood, R rated! Yes, an R rated summer blockbuster! Let's hope we go back to this sort of braver movie industry some day soon.If one is able to view T2 in isolation of its success and influence it's a superbly crafted slice of intelligent action sci-fi. Admittedly somewhat bloated (in its extended form at least) and exuberant in comparison to the lean and gritty low budget original but is that really a bad thing? Do the two films not perfectly complement one another?After his incredibly fraught shoot on 1989's The Abyss (he didn't actually finish that film to his satisfaction until 1992) Cameron made sure that another ambitious project such as T2 would not suffer such troubles. He assembled the very finest crew (sound effects, editing and cinematography especially) and the quality of their work is all up there on screen. It's easily one of the most consistently beautifully shot films of the genre, unless of course you really don't like steely blue hues. I'll address one popular criticism of T2, namely Arnie being the good guy. The original idea for the first film was that the Terminator's appearance would be that of a regular Joe who would just blend into a crowd as opposed to the imposing frame of the Austrian Oak (hardly a subtle infiltration unit). Robert Patrick's police officer garbed T-1000 was just that, a chameleon, a shape shifter, he could be anyone. Therein lay the threat. That image of the partially formed, chrome T-1000 coolly waking out of a flaming truck wreck left jaws on floors and the subsequent imagery of his various acts of morphing were like nothing anyone had ever seen. Has there been a more innocuous looking yet totally unstoppable movie villain before or since? Unlike the subsequent slew of films that either overused or poorly implemented computer effects, in T2 they serve the plot first and foremost. Returning cast members were on board, a ripped, lean Linda Hamilton famously getting into superhuman shape to play a much harder, weathered Sarah Connor is better than she's ever been. Michael Biehn (a well implemented cameo in the extended version) and Earl Boen reprise their respective roles from the original. Some deride Edward Furlong's John Connor but in comparison to some other first time child actors I can think of (yes you Jake Lloyd!) his performance is more than acceptable. Writer, William Wisher (he cameos as 'guy with camera in mall' fact fans) ran with an idea deleted from the original, namely Sarah's idea to go after and stop Cyberdyne Systems. Instead of portraying the man who develops Skynet as a typical driven, power-mad scientist, here Joe Morton gives us a decent family man faced with the sickening realisation that his well intentioned day job will cause mankind's extinction. I'd just call in sick. The film moves from one superbly choreographed, action set-piece to the next. It's lengthy runtime suitably balanced by several quieter reflective character moments. Brad Fiedel's stunningly haunting score complements these scenes perfectly, lending the story an even greater sense of the pending apocalypse that Sarah knows is coming. The pace of the film, whilst not as continually break-neck as the first, still keeps you on edge. I am occasionally torn as to whether T2 is a better film than the first. Then I think back to how the film made such an impact in August of 1991. Never had such a well crafted roller coaster of a film been seen. Yes I do question the need for some of the film's lighter, humorous moments but I am willing to forgive them in light of the exceptional quality of the movie, a film that hasn't noticeably aged at all. T2 was the ultimate game changer of the early to mid 90's. It gave us things we hadn't seen before and was a sequel easily as good as if not better than the original.

For my taste and sensibilities this film is truly out in left field somewhere. It's not that the acting is bad...it's the story that I simply do not and cannot fathom...and I happen to be gay! It is said that this piece of brilliance was hatched from a true story concerning the acceptance speech given by Tom Hanks, upon winning his best actor Oscar for Philadelphia. During the Let me thank everyone for everything that has happened throughout my life phase it seems Mr. Hanks accidentally outed one of his teachers and another student in the bargain. So, here we have the premise for In & Out, presumably a spoof on that Oooops moment, but even as a spoof it fails. It's simply not tongue-in-cheek enough, funny enough or ridiculous enough to cover the territory. Using the same backdrop as the original incident, the Academy Awards, and with many, many fine uncredited stars appearing, the writer offers up a very well respected, well liked teacher and coach as the outed victim. He is from the mid-west and is just about to be married to a Twinkie eating and overfed, Joan Cusack. It seems that on Oscar night, the entire population of the town is watching the broadcast because a native son is up for the award for Best Actor and they are suddenly catapulted into a world they know very little of because of his acceptance speech. There doesn't seem to be any other closeted or suspected homosexuals in the town...and certainly no one that is out! OK...fair enough, but from here the story takes on an Oz like twist. Our outed teacher does not lose his fiancé, friends, family or the support of his students and while he does get fired from his teaching job, comes back to support his students at graduation and sits on the stage with the school officials! Scores of reporters descend upon the town to cover this news event and one of the reporters (Tom Selleck) turns out to be gay! There is neither horror or hilarity at this unveiling, however, and our teacher tries to show he is not gay. He is being married in just a few days and the wedding is still on. In all the situations set up to make one laugh, the writer falls short of his intended reaction. In the scene with the priest we should have roared, the scene listing the many tips that might have revealed his sexuality should have made us fall down in laughter, his fiancé's continued befuddled reaction to all of it, the revelation that he has never slept with his intended and his hasty attempt to do so before the nuptials, the bachelor party replete with blow-up doll and good-old-boy innuendo, his parents puzzled reaction and ongoing stiff upper lip demeanor, the eventual wedding service when he finally utters the dreaded words...I'm gay...all should have us sitting with tears rolling down our cheeks from laughter but it all went for nothing. In all, it would seem his only real penance is that he ends up not winning the Teacher of the Year award! There is but one very funny moment in the film and that is when the lady who uses a walker is dancing to Macho Man by The Village People near the end of the film. Paul Rudnick, who wrote the screenplay, is himself a gay man and, as such, I cannot understand his treatment of the subject matter. This should have been a hilarious piece for both the homosexual and heterosexual communities and might have brought them closer together, through laughter, as co-inhabitants and neighbors in a crazy world. The film has not accomplished that either. Mr. Rudnick just didn't capitalize on the funny scenarios he, himself, created because he gave all of them short shrift.

But when pushed to the extreme, his character can change from mild-mannered teenager to heroic vigilante when need be. It's a fantastic blend of realism and fantasy that one expects from a super-hero. And this version of Spiderman is no exception. But the actor who really over-shadows the whole production, is Willem Dafoe as Norman Osbourne\/Green Goblin. His bi-polar tendencies make for an extremely shifty and mysterious performance. He comes off as being both terrifying and hilarious when the situation calls for it. If the film had not possessed the amazing talent of either of these stars, than perhaps it wouldn't have been nearly as charming.It can't be denied that the film suffers from a sprinkling of corny moments. Both from the characters and the action sequences itself. Fortunately, these silly moments are few and far between. And the drama and intensity of the story arc over-shadows anything that can be considered too over the top or ridiculous. It is the darkness that this film weaves(no pun intended)ambiguously into the plot that saves the film from becoming another kid-friendly super hero bomb.Though it can be sometimes laughable and cliché in a certain light, it's without a doubt one of the more passionate super hero films to date.

Basically it is the famous Charles Dickens story of Oliver Twist, with a twist, cats and dogs, and only a few humans, play the central roles, the plot is a little altered but pretty much the same, and it is set in modern day 1980's New York City. Little orphaned kitten Oliver (Joseph 'Joey' Lawrence) is the only one of a litter not to be taken by passers by, and winds up alone in the Big Apple, but after being tricked to assisting a laid back streetwise Jack Russell Terrier dog named Dodger (Billy Joel) steal a string of sausages from a hot dog stand Oliver is taken in by the dog's gang. The Dodger is part of a small gang of dog pickpockets, and their leader is human pickpocket Fagin (Dom DeLuise), the other dogs friends are Tito the Chihuahua (Richard 'Cheech' Marin), Einstein the Great Dane (Richard Mulligan), Rita the Saluki (Sheryl Lee Ralph) and Francis the Bulldog (Roscoe Lee Browne). The kitten joins the gang, they are selling shoddy good and stealing money and valuable stuff so that Fagin can pay back ruthless shipyard agent and loan shark Sykes (Robert Loggia), during one particular trip however Oliver gets caught in a limousine by it's passenger, little girl Jenny Foxworth (Natalie Gregory), and butler Winston (William Glover). Jenny's rich parents are away travelling the world, so she is allowed to adopt the lonely kitten, but his presence enrages and caused jealousy from family pompous and pampered poodle Georgette (Bette Midler), until Dodger and the gang eventually find them, and take him from the house. Oliver explains he was happy to be treated kindly and have a real home, Dodger feels disheartened and lets him leave, but Fagin hears the kitten has been taken in by someone rich, he comes up with the idea to ransom him so that his owner will pay a large amount for his return, he tells this plan to Sykes as well. Jenny finds the ransom note and follows the instructions, taking Georgette with her, Fagin realises the owner is an innocent little girl and his conscience takes over, but as he gives her kitten back freely Sykes comes out of the shadows and kidnaps the girl to ransom her, Dodger and the gang chase after the villain, until Sykes is defeated by a train collision on the Brooklyn Bridge.

Basically it is the famous Charles Dickens story of Oliver Twist, with a twist, cats and dogs, and only a few humans, play the central roles, the plot is a little altered but pretty much the same, and it is set in modern day 1980's New York City. Little orphaned kitten Oliver (Joseph 'Joey' Lawrence) is the only one of a litter not to be taken by passers by, and winds up alone in the Big Apple, but after being tricked to assisting a laid back streetwise Jack Russell Terrier dog named Dodger (Billy Joel) steal a string of sausages from a hot dog stand Oliver is taken in by the dog's gang. The Dodger is part of a small gang of dog pickpockets, and their leader is human pickpocket Fagin (Dom DeLuise), the other dogs friends are Tito the Chihuahua (Richard 'Cheech' Marin), Einstein the Great Dane (Richard Mulligan), Rita the Saluki (Sheryl Lee Ralph) and Francis the Bulldog (Roscoe Lee Browne). The kitten joins the gang, they are selling shoddy good and stealing money and valuable stuff so that Fagin can pay back ruthless shipyard agent and loan shark Sykes (Robert Loggia), during one particular trip however Oliver gets caught in a limousine by it's passenger, little girl Jenny Foxworth (Natalie Gregory), and butler Winston (William Glover). Jenny's rich parents are away travelling the world, so she is allowed to adopt the lonely kitten, but his presence enrages and caused jealousy from family pompous and pampered poodle Georgette (Bette Midler), until Dodger and the gang eventually find them, and take him from the house. Oliver explains he was happy to be treated kindly and have a real home, Dodger feels disheartened and lets him leave, but Fagin hears the kitten has been taken in by someone rich, he comes up with the idea to ransom him so that his owner will pay a large amount for his return, he tells this plan to Sykes as well. Jenny finds the ransom note and follows the instructions, taking Georgette with her, Fagin realises the owner is an innocent little girl and his conscience takes over, but as he gives her kitten back freely Sykes comes out of the shadows and kidnaps the girl to ransom her, Dodger and the gang chase after the villain, until Sykes is defeated by a train collision on the Brooklyn Bridge.

Stone volunteered for the army in 1967 as a college drop-out. He wrote the screenplay for Platoon in 1975 but it took over ten years until he was able to film it. What separates Platoon from other American films dealing with the Vietnam War is that it depicts wartime massacres. Films before that, like The Deer Hunter (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979), only focused on the shattered psyches produced by the war. Keep in mind though that Platoon is a mainstream movie, so it doesn't come anywhere near the brutality that the Americans sometimes demonstrated. The 1968 My Lai Massacre, in which as many as 504 unarmed civilians were killed, is just one of many examples. The Vietnam War is considered to be the greatest trauma of 20th century American history, but a few decades later the USA savagely attacked Yugoslavia and Iraq. Platoon made a lot of money at the box office, mainly because Stone has the ability to make a film entertaining no matter what it's about. The film's partial blindness to the war was another reason for its success. It's not made clear who the American soldiers are actually fighting and why they invaded Vietnam in the first place. Let's also not forget that Stone dedicated the film to the men who lost their lives. So, when Stone is accused by some people of being anti-American or a leftie I can just laugh at their foolishness. What's most interesting about Platoon for me is that Stone brought his own experience of being a soldier in Vietnam. When Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) said that you don't really sleep even when you do get time to sleep I was immediately reminded of what my father told me. My father served in the army. Even though he didn't see combat he told me that he still stayed awake. In Platoon Stone looks at the war from his educated middle-class point of view. He shows the behavior of under-privileged blacks and of white trash from middle America. Stone's direction is very good, so it's not a surprise that he won an Oscar. With cinematographer Robert Richardson he managed to capture some impressive images. He also brought intelligence to the film by depicting a war between two sergeants, Barnes (Tom Berenger) and Elias (Willem Dafoe). It's pretty much Jesus (Elias) fighting against the covetous shadow of the American dream (Barnes). The performances by most of the cast are very good. Berenger and Dafoe are terrific. They're clearly the standouts. Historian Carroll Quigley thought that what happened to Western civilization in the first half of the 20th century was a tragedy. It's clear why. There were two big wars, a depression, and the coming of fascism. In addition to that the Russians foiled the plans of the Germans and the British and captured Eastern Europe. Yet Quigley still had hope when he wrote his famous book in the 1960s. But, as the Vietnam War dragged on, he began to lose this hope. He began to think that Western civilization is nearly finished. I think that there's still hope for Western civilization, though the Vietnam War was yet another example of the crisis that this society is going through. Platoon isn't my favorite war movie. I like Come And See (1985) and Apocalypse Now (1979) more, but I easily recommend Platoon too.

Never since I was born, or to my recollection, since that year, has there been a better year for movies. Pictures like The Shawshank Redemption, Legends of the Fall, Pulp Fiction, even The Crow all came out that year. And then there was the year's crowning jewel - Forrest Gump. This is probably my favorite movie of all time. Anytime I feel down, or just tired of the world beating down on me, I can watch Forrest Gump and for a few hours, just forget everything. Twenty years later (and I can't believe it's been 20 years!) the movie still has the same effect on me. The story revolves around Forrest Gump, and man born with both physical and mental challenges, but with the wisdom and guidance from his mother, suggestion from his best friend Jenny (to just run if he was in trouble) and his kindness and good nature (and somewhat bumbling nature), he succeeds in life. Whether he's running from bullies, or bullets, or just life and heartache in general, Tom Hanks performance (coming off his first Oscar Win for Philadelphia) was his absolute best. He rightfully won his second Best Actor Oscar for his performance here. The trials and tribulations Forrest overcomes, while humorously interjecting himself in some of the most memorable events in American History from the 60's and 70's makes the film that much more fun to watch. The supporting cast (Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Sally Fields) and really everyone in the movie does an exceptional job of bringing it all together. Forrest Gump is a feel good movie, and a true staple of the 1990's. The soundtrack is one of the very best ever compiled for a movie, and one of the few times I ran out and bough a movie soundtrack. I almost wish I could go back to 1994 and experience it again in a movie theater. But I'd want to do that for every major picture of 1994. If you've never experienced Gump - I highly recommend that you do! Even more-so if you're in need of cheering up.
