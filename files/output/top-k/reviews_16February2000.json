Even the songs this time round are enjoyable (except, maybe, Jessie's lachrymose lament).  It deals with unbearably complex dilemmas with a maturity untapped by the likes of AMERICAN BEAUTY.

They mustn't watch too many cartoons, because films from PINOCCHIO to THE THREE CABALLEROS to THE LION KING offer a similar assortment of riches.  Maybe they're secretly afraid that their precious actors will be made redundant.2 works on many different levels.  Most immediately satisfying is the Hawksian romantic-comedy action movie, in which we watch men in action , at work, facing dark realities, positing loyalty and friendship as shores against the ruins.  This strand has a sublime emotional ambiguity, as on one level Buzz and friends repeatedly risk their lives to save a friend (Buzz is the Hawksian hero who must redeem himself after the first movie), while Woody (who also must redeem himself) at last finds a family, somewhere to belong just as he seemed outmoded and unloved.This difficult choice between friendship proven in action and mere family ties is brilliantly, painfully revealed, and there are no easy answers. For the benefit of resolution, the family is not a love interest, which could have made things more awkward, and one member is made villainous for convenience, but the questions raised are still valid.The film also works as an essay in making strange and unreliable the domestic and conservative.  On the one hand, there is something satisfyingly Surrealist about a house in which objects have more life than its human inhabitants - the different strands of reality set up by Buzz's opening adventures suggest that this may be the dream of an over-imaginative boy. There is a lack of fixity and control in having objects, bought by you to do your bidding, acting independently; it makes the solidity of the home unstable and unpredictable.Yet, on the other hand, this alternative community is itself ordered in its seeming chaos, with almost military precision, and even before its terrifying adventures, its threats ARE the domestic, the fickleness of a child, the thoughtlessness of a mother, the vulnerability that privileges menacing villains.2's great brilliance, though, lies in its expressing an awareness of its status as a sequal with the existential crises of its two heroes.  Woody starts the film with a lost hat (traditional emblem of masculine wholeness, virility, sexual prowess etc); he damages, then loses an arm; is abandoned and has a sublimely terrifying nightmare where the solidity of his existence crumbles, and he imagines the abyss of death.Already shaken in identity, he is kidnapped, wrenched from familiar bearings, while performing a heroic act, and finds out that he is not a single, whole Woody, but part of a vast Woody legend, connected (as is this film) to a venerable tradition, repeated and reproduced ad nauseum, through merchandise.  His sense of wholeness destroyed, he accepts his fate, his destiny away from the world of life that is Andy's bedroom, to the sterile immortality of the museum.In TOY STORY, Buzz already came to an awareness of his own limited masculinity.  But, in the film's most astonishing conceit, he faces a catacomb of Buzz Lightyears, and is forced to confront not only his lack of uniqueness, and not only the deluded image of his former past, but a new improved model; like Woody, Buzz becomes aware of the transience of life. The film opens with Buzz as intrepid action hero, only to be shockingly destroyed and shown to be a puppet in a computer game.The image of two Buzzes and their evil father point to an awareness of the ambiguity of being a sequel (as a son is to a father), but also the powerlessness of anything in a postmodern world; there is no such thing as the film as unit - it is splintered outwards through merchandise, sequels, promotion etc.Of course, 2 is most cherishable for being an incredible work of animation. So we're a bit jaded after STORY, but the CITIZEN KANE-like depth of field, the unheard of cinematic fluidity (which is not just trickery, but emotionally charged), the vibrant suburban colours, the ingenious characterisation (love Newman as, well, Newman), the awesome set-pieces (my favourite?  Either Woody's dream or Buzz and friends crossing the road) and exciting action, the musical-like freedom and audacity, the ingenious compositions, the very tangibility of the characters unavailable to live action, are all breathtaking.  In the end, I think I prefer the classical simplicity of STORY to this film's more varied daring, but who cares?

It should have been so much better but it wasn't. That's not to say that ED Wood is a poor film, far from it but with a little better casting, it would have been near perfect. As it stands, the performances (and I use the term loosely) of Johnny Depp and Sarah Jessica Parker nearly ruin all that the film achieves. But let's look at the good. It was a very, very long time ago that someone who won an Oscar truly deserved it. Martin Landau deserved his Oscar for his incredible turn as Bela Lugosi. He was simply not playing a role in a film, he was Bela Lugosi. There are times that the makeup, cinematography and Landau's performance make you forget that that you are seeing Martin Landau. You are seeing him literally become the late horror star. Its one of the most remarkable feats in recent cinema history and truly deserving of the praise. It's an understatement to say Landau steals the film, he literally picks it up and carries it away with him. There is another stellar performance in the film, that of Patricia Arquete as Kathy. It's a warm, understated performance that was as deserving of an Oscar nomination as Landau's. Bill Murray is an always welcome presence and the casting of Jeffrey Jones as Criswell is pure brilliance. Those two always give their best no matter what film they appear in. Director Burton deserves much credit for his brave stance of filming the picture in Black and White, it simply would not have worked in color. Regretably, this descision is probably what killed the film at the box office but Burton truly showed he knew what he was doing. This is a movie that begged to shot that way and Burton delivered. Burton must also be given a major thumbs up for packing the movie with Ed Wood's real life hangers on in cameo roles as well as casting wrestling promoter Gene LaBell and exotic pianist Korla Pandit in small but noticeable parts. And lets' face it, who else could have played Tor Johnson but George Steele?All in all the film would rank a solid 10 if it wasn't for the participation of Depp and Parker. Why is Tim Burton so enamored with this Johnny Depp? He has proven time and time again that he simply cannot act and in Ed Wood, he cannot act with a vengeance. Watch for his scenes near the end, instead of projecting wide eyed wonder as was called for, he projects the image of a madman about to go on a killing spree. A truly poor performance that almost ruins the film. Nearly as bad is Sarah Jessica Parker. Some see her as a very talented actress. I see her as a scenery chewing hack who is a major eye sore. And we can't forget that Burton's girlfriend Lisa Marie plays Vampira. A note to perspective and veteran directors, do not, under any circumstance cast your girlfriends in your movies. Marie is laughably bad. Martin Landau's fetching daughter, Juliet (who plays Loretta King) would have been a far more inspired choice for the role.Make no mistake, Ed Wood is a good film but with some better casting in two of it's major roles, it could have been so much better. Still if you are a fan of the cross dressing director, you need to see this film. It certainly wasn't deserving of it's poor box office run Johnny Depp or not.

It was deemed a suicide, and Bram  fills in the blanks that the facts that led to it  leave.  It's masterly guesswork about the demise of  an artist who in his heyday created an image that is  forever etched in the consciousness of the  moviegoing public a flat-headed, megacephalic  monster with bolts in his neck we all know as  Frankenstein.  Whale had been dying of a disease  that left his mind unravelled, a mass of memories  and mush, when what's left of his attention turns to  thoughts of lust and he feasts his eyes on his new  gardener, a wannabe Marine with a beautifully  outsized head named Clay Boone.  He's straight, and  Whale cunningly sets out to seduce him.  Their  relationship develops into one of interest and  intrigue, revulsion and regard, and surprises us  with the impression Clay's brush with Whale has left  him.I wish I could say that Bill Condon had done Bram's  story justice.  Oscar apparently thought so, but the  movie version Gods and Monsters is disappointing.   It's bland and placid when you want it to be daring  and downright dirty.  It's respectful when you want  it to be irreverent and imaginative.  The flashbacks  to the movie set of Bride of Frankenstein are flip  when you want Condon to establish a sense of  dedication and seriousness to moviecraft.  The  wandering memories about the painful past of Whale  slip by when you want them to take hold of you and  never let go.As good as Ian McKellen is, his work here is not as  impressive as his nastiness in an earlier release  from the same year--the adaptation of a Stephen King  novel Apt Pupil.  McKellen plays James Whale like  a cagey, desperate rat, but the sum total of his  performance is too urbane to grip you.  He's wily,  but his calculations don't add up to anything  memorable.  It floats away like that slow-motion  fantasy long-shot of Frankenstein walking against a  barren horizon.The surprise is Brendan Fraser.  He is the perfect  embodiment of Clay Boone, and yet he seems not quite  right for the part.  Maybe Fraser is too  sensitive-looking; this actor has such expressive  eyes that he seems all wrong in a dive, wasting his  time with easy lays and odd gardening jobs.  You  feel as though he was capable of matching his new  acquaintance's eloquence, bon mot for bon mot.  Yet  Fraser makes you feel that underlying attraction  Boone has for Whale.  It's less sexual than a brand  of flirtatious movie-idol worship that we've never  seen quite this way on the screen before.  It's new  and maybe the only thing in the movie you can take  away with you.It may also be new to the screen for us to see a  distaff version of a hunchbacked Igor-like sidekick  that Lynn Redgrave plays as Hanna, Whale's  housekeeper.  Redgrave's ungainliness is played for  laughs again, but her Hanna refuses to be taken  lightly.  There are times when you wished you saw  Hanna in her own milieu--with her family and  friends--so she didn't seem so much like a  caricature.  But what time she is allowed in front  of the camera makes its points.  Redgrave makes it  clear that the once-world-renowned director could  not have had a more devoted, caring servant.Jack Plotnick disgraces himself as a silly fan\/interviewer who submits to a casual striptease for the interview.

That evening he attends a high school basketball game, where he meets his daughter's jailbait best friend Angela (Mena Suvari). She inspires Lester to return to his youthful vigour and completely reinvent his life. This forces his family and neighbours to reinvent their lives. As events become more and more convoluted, Lester finds himself less and less in control of his life... This film has already been hailed as the greatest of all time even over the likes of Citizen Kane and The Godfather. But is all this praise deserved? Well I certainly think it is. Director Sam Mendes and screenwriter Alan Ball both make their feature debuts Ball used to write sitcoms, while Mendes is an acclaimed theatre director, whose most recent success was last year's The Blue Room. Mendes is also British and lends an outsider's viewpoint to Ball's very American story. It portrays each participant as both a caricature and a human being, something great comedy writers excell in doing. I am running out of adjectives to describe Kevin Spacey's greatness, but now funny can be added to the heap. The film's comedy takes almost every form, from traditional (Lester picks up his briefcase and the contents fall out), to wit (Today I blackmailed my boss for $60,000. Pass the asparagus), to farce (Lester's neighbour thinks he is paying his son for sex, rather than dope) to very dark satire. The entire cast is outstanding in fact, but the best performance is Chris Cooper's as the afore-mentioned psychotic neighbour, who violently beats his son.It takes some time after the film to digest everything that has occured and work out what it means. The script shares major similarities with Fight Club (a man rejecting upper-middle-class to violently rediscover himself) and 70's British sitcom The Fall And Rise Of Reginald Perrin, which has an almost identical story, several hundred shades lighter, and is a source Mendes himself acknowleges. But whereas Fight Club is about being human, American Beauty is about being as human as possible. It shows that we can learn about ourselves, that we all have hidden depths. Sometimes they are exposed,  sometimes repressed, some are constructive, some destructive. But we must never be afraid of them. They make us what we are, who we are.So what, other than a film, is American Beauty? A comedy, a tragedy, a drama, a murder-mystery, a social comment, a psychological comment... But it is one thing above all others. It shows that we don't really know who we are, and that we really ought to find out. It is a state of mind.

I thought it was a horror film, and horror is not my cup of tea.  However, when I began reading reviews about it, I began to reconsider and finally got the courage to see it.  It was a good thing I did, for The Sixth Sense is really a fine film.Since everyone by now knows about the film, I will not go into much detail about the plot.  Bruce Willis plays Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist who was a great success -- with all but one former patient who later accused him of having failed the patient.  The former patient then shoots Crowe and kills himself.  The sense of failure devastates Crowe and strains his marriage.  So, Crowe decides to help Cole Sear, played by Haley Joel Osment, a boy who reminds him of the former patient.  But Crowe gets more than he bargained for.  Abnormal sychology is little help in this matter, and eventually Crowe must abandon his preconceptions in order to help Cole -- and eventually himself.The film is great.  True, it may seem slow to some, but it's simply taking its time to create the proper atmosphere.The actors are what make the film great.  Olivia Williams, as Crowe's wife, does a fine job with what she has.  Toni Collette also does a fine job as Cole's mother, who truly loves her son but does not know what's wrong with him.  Her love is why Cole can't confide in her until the end.  Since I never saw the Die Hard films, I don't have any preconceptions of Willis as an actor, so I thought he was just fine as Crowe.  His performance was understated, and by the end of the film, you see why it was that way.  And it was a pleasant surprise to see Shakespearean actor Greg Wood as the father of the poisoned girl.  (I'm a Shakespeare nut.)But the best performance has to come from Haley Joel Osment as Cole.  He was terrific!  That was probably the main reason why the movie was as unnerving and as great as it was.  He really made me feel Cole's terror whenever the ghosts appeared.  He stole the show, and indeed it was best he stole the show, as the movie would've suffered without his acting ability.  I hope he wins the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, as I believe he truly deserves it.One final note  the ending is really great!  It explains a lot that might have been confusing to some.So, I suggest you see The Sixth Sense, even if you have to rent it on video or buy a DVD to do so.  It is really a great film, as its six Oscar nominations indicate.

In one of his best books, FICTIONS, JLB wrote about lands who do not exist (Tlon Uqbar Orbis Tertius), books never written (The Books of Herbert Quain)and careers of people absent from any encyclopaedia (Pierre Menard, author of the real Don Quixote). Abiding to his taste, Woody Allen has picked up a jazz guitar player supposed to be No.2 after Django Reinhardt, and joins three jazz specialists to describe his career, his loves and his failures. This enables us to hear some fine performances by Bucky Pizzarelli (unnoticed by many, for his name appears only in a flash on the ending titles, alas never played to their entirety, with largest regrets for LIMEHOUSE BLUES). The main character, a womanizer, a pimp and a kleptomaniac,never touches us with admirations,regrets or understanding, leaving room only for Mr Allen's work, which is one of the poorest he ever gratified us with.Perhaps he should made less but better movies; but he seems to take the contrary steps, because he has two or three projects for 2000 and one for 2001.
