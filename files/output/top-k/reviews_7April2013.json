It is about not being truly happy with your life, and when you discover what you want, being willing to make the sacrifices necessary to keep it. One of these is overcoming your fears. This is what Alex Whitman (Matthew Perry), and photographer Isabel Fuentes (Salma Hayak), have to do throughout the film. One big issue is the families involved Alex's are blue blood WASP types, and Isabel's are very traditional Mexicans. It is also Alex's story (far more than Isabel's), and how he really does not like his life, he just does not know any other way.

While going to Yale, is expected for someone like him, taking a difficult major outside the family business was not. So was marrying Cathy Stewart (Suzanne Snyder), who to quote Alex Was pursuing me since the 3rd Grade. Since the Stewart's were good friends of his parent's (John Bennett Perry (Matthew's real life father) and Jill Clayburgh), it would have been the easy thing simply to marry her, and please them (Although he finds it difficult to stand up to them (Which will create problems later on)). Spoilers Ahead He and his best friend Jeff (Jon Tenny) are transferred From the New York office where they work, to Las Vegas for a construction project. He then meets Isabel in a Mexican Restaurant and lets her cut the line to the bathroom, and from there they have a one night stand, and then she disappears. Month's later, she shows up pregnant, and he offers to meet her family, so she would not be shamed into being pregnant with someone they never met. When he does, he really likes the big family environment and comments on how his family never eats together. He then offers to any marry her, and he is happy with her, until his parent's show up, and he cannot admit to them Isabel is his wife. From there, the relationship starts to sour, because of family issues, mistrust, lies (She told him she had an miscarriage), and their fears. In one scene Isabel goes to Mexico to visit her great grandmother, and admitted how much she loved Alex, but was afraid of being hurt. They finally agree to get a divorce, but Alex (Now back in New York) is miserable. He runs into a Priest, who tells him There are signs out there. Pictures of The Grand Canyon, a chihuahua, and a little girl named Isabel, remind him of her, and he does not want the divorce (Although time is running out). So he goes down to Mexico (Where he found out she was), and takes a cheap plane from Mexico City, an old bus, and a mule, to get to her great grandmother's only to find out she was heading back to Las Vegas (He had no idea it was to bear his child, since he did not speak or understand Spanish). He gets there first, and is standing on Hoover Dam, and a huge rainstorm happens and he gets drenched. Finally she is driving and sees him and almost causes an accident. She is mad at him (And more at herself because she lost hope (She broke up with a previous boy friend because a necklace broke which to her was a sign)), then he finds out she is still pregnant, and they both admit they were lying and afraid. Then her water broke, and she is going to have the baby right on the Dam. What really impresses her, is the fact that he would travel all the way to Mexico just for her (He had no idea she was still pregnant). When the baby comes (A girl), Isabel asks Do you think she will like living in New York City?' Alex says Not as much as camping in the desert. A key point, because one of Isabel's brother's explained, that her life is here, and she would not be happy anywhere else. Then Isabel said With a few Gray's Papaya hot dogs (A famous New York hot dog). Alex then says, Oh no. Isabel says' What? Alex says We're divorced.

However, there are many forces that seem to be pushing him to return to the addicted lifestyle, as Frankie foolishly returns to his old haunts. Two hoods (Darren McGavin and Robert Strauss) want him to return to gambling--and getting him hooked on the drugs once again will ensure this.

What's to happen to Frankie?! There are two main reasons the film works so well. The film is very well written and often surprises you with its violence and dark mood. Also, I really marveled at Sinatra's performance--probably the best of his career. Seeing him go through withdrawal was painful but exceptionally well done.

This time, we have a believable plot, good allies, a decent villain and a Bond film that relies more on wit and ruthlessness than lasers or crazy motives. Though I don't think the overall finish is as good as The Spy who Loved Me, this is one of Moore's better outings, even if it does have a rather pointless opening sequence that could have broken the film had it not been for the plot strengthening after the credits. When a British marine archaeologist is murdered in cold blood with his wife, Bond is sent to investigate because it turns out the archaeologist was attempting to rescue a specific piece of of equipment used by NATO, that the Russians want. Bond thinks that he has found a friend in Kristatos, a Greek who knows the area and who has pledged his help, but following a running in with a smuggler, Columbo (fabulously acted by Topol), he discovers that Kristatos is the villain, and is in direct talks with the Russians to sell them the device. Bond, Topol and the daughter of the archaeologist, Melina, all go after Kristatos, leading to a thrilling finale in a monastery. This is another good turn from Moore as Bond, who once again shows us that he can act, and that he can offer some ruthlessness when he needs to. It was in many ways a shame that he didn't bow out from the franchise after this outing, as it would have been a great finale for him. Instead, he did two more films that weren't so good, and I think because he has a few weak outings, it detracts from the Bond outings that were good. He is often remembered more for the comical acts, rather than the stronger films he was associated with. For your Eyes only also benefits from a more intense, stronger Bond girl in the form of Melina, (Carole Bouquet), who wants revenge for the death of her family, and from Topol as Columbo, who is much like Kerim Bay in the film From Russia with Love. Julian Glover is also more stylish, down to earth villain who may not be as strong as previous villains, but is far more believable. This would have been worth an 8\/10, except for two problems. One is the appalling soundtrack, and the other is that at times, the plot is too much like previous Bonds, and doesn't really add anything to the franchise. So, for that, I think 7\/10 is more appropriate.

He is often remembered more for the comical acts, rather than the stronger films he was associated with. For your Eyes only also benefits from a more intense, stronger Bond girl in the form of Melina, (Carole Bouquet), who wants revenge for the death of her family, and from Topol as Columbo, who is much like Kerim Bay in the film From Russia with Love. Julian Glover is also more stylish, down to earth villain who may not be as strong as previous villains, but is far more believable. This would have been worth an 8\/10, except for two problems. One is the appalling soundtrack, and the other is that at times, the plot is too much like previous Bonds, and doesn't really add anything to the franchise.

This time, we have a believable plot, good allies, a decent villain and a Bond film that relies more on wit and ruthlessness than lasers or crazy motives. Though I don't think the overall finish is as good as The Spy who Loved Me, this is one of Moore's better outings, even if it does have a rather pointless opening sequence that could have broken the film had it not been for the plot strengthening after the credits. When a British marine archaeologist is murdered in cold blood with his wife, Bond is sent to investigate because it turns out the archaeologist was attempting to rescue a specific piece of of equipment used by NATO, that the Russians want.

Instead of picking one plot and sticking to it, this film turns into a bit of a camp mess. It's saving grace is that it's fun. There isn't much else to it than that!James Bond is hot on the trail of Blofeld, who murdered his wife. I have often wondered what would have been made of this film had George Lazenby stayed with the franchise. It could have been a far more personal mission of revenge. As it, this film gets lost in trying to do too many things. Is it about the revenge of his wife? Not entirely. Is it about Blofeld? A bit. Diamond smuggling? Here and there? Space? Yep, but just at the end. It even has the classic scientist who wants 'world peace', and yet another side story about a missing Howard Hughes type tycoon and two of the most bizarre henchmen in any film, let alone a Bond film. In a nutshell, this is about Blofeld smuggling diamonds to make a space laser beam to destroy military establishments. But there is so much going on, with so many characters, that it simply never works. The lost and far-reaching plot, mixed with the overly camp humour, poor Bond girls and the feeling that Connery just didn't care make this a bit of a mess, that just happens to somehow entertain on some level. There are some great action scenes here and there, but in my mind, this is one of the poorer Bond films, with the exception of the great signature tune by Shirley Bassey. This could have and should have been so much more than it was. The producers needed to either focus on the diamond smuggling, or (as I think), they needed to make this a more personal Bond where Bond avenges the death of his wife. Had Lazenby stayed, I think it would have been different. He didn't, Connery came back, and it just didn't work out because they made it for the wrong reasons. I'm glad for everyone's sake that Bond moved on from Connery at this stage. Good for an afternoon with beer and crisps and a laugh, but not for anything else. 6\/10.

More romantic than Gnomeo & Juliet and tragic than Warm Bodies (Both whose movies were based on Shakespeare's play), we can take note that nothing can beat the original.From the beginning of the movie, anybody can tell that the actors are young and inexperienced. This may seem like a bad thing to us spoiled movie-addicts who have already seen the best actors, but having adolescent actors were a new idea that was introduced during the time that this movie was released. Zeffirelli avoided using the ancient practice of using older actors in the numerous movies that preceded this one. Thank God-! I wouldn't want to watch the concept of Romeo and Juliet revolving around two middle-aged actors.When Romeo (Leonard Whiting), a Montague, falls in love with one of his family's enemies, Juliet (Olivia Hussey), a Capulet, they decide to secretly get married, and so they do. It still boggles my mind why they would want to get married with only a few confrontations between each other. I mean, how far can they get without any problems in their marriage?Not very far. Problems start to arise when Romeo gets banished from Verona because he killed Tybalt (Michael York), a Capulet. As a result Juliet's lover, Paris (Roberto Bisacco), also a Capulet wants to marry her as soon as possible. Juliet doesn't want to marry Paris and only wants Romeo so Friar Laurence (Milo O'Shea), the one who performs the rights of marriage for Romeo and Juliet, makes a plan. The plan is to give Juliet a potion that would make her seem dead, so that she would be buried in the Capulet graveyard. The Friar would send a messenger to Romeo to find her there. Then they would abandon Verona and go live off somewhere else. All this for a person they have barely known.Yes, the movie was set almost word by words by Shakespeare's play, but perhaps that was the thing that restricted this movie from being even better. Some of the things the characters say to each other just sound absurd from time to time. It just felt kind of cheesy. On top of that, there wasn't too much suspense throughout the movie because as a reader of Romeo and Juliet, I already know what's going to happen. Just because it says They fight at the beginning of a brawl doesn't mean that the play has to be that dull.O Zeffirelli, Zeffirelli, wherefore art thou creativity?Of course this isn't entirely Zeffirelli's fault, as he couldn't add alter the anything from the play, but perhaps something could have been done.Despite that, everything else was how I imagined it go, the crowded streets, soft voice of the narrator, peaceful music to occupy the otherwise empty scenes.This movie reaches my expectations, but doesn't quite reach one of my Top 10 Movies list.Contains light gore, fighting, and lots of intense teen drama that escalates quickly.

He has the physique, the voice and the jaw, it's just a shame that ego got in the way of such a perfect match.The actual film itself, if you are able to pull your head out of your comic book loving arse, is quite honestly a really decent 90's action sci-fi flick. There is lots of excitement and enough to keep anyone occupied for a couple of hours. It does feel however that more could have been explored in the film.Glaring flaws aside Hollywood in the 80's and 90's had a really nasty habit of making a film about a subject matter then writing a story that takes the main character totally out of the norm.This is rectified in the 2012 film where it's just Dredd doing his day to day job and that's what we want. Here Dredd is taken out of his job and thrust into a situation that we just don't want to see him in. At least they kept Rico instead of a generic made up villain and much of the genetic lore of Dredd.If you want a fun action film with a good look to kill an hour or two that Judge Dredd is well worth checking out but if you're looking for authenticity well.....you have the alternative now, so enjoy this for what it is, however an annoyingly missed opportunity it may be!

Nevertheless, I still consider that The Jungle Book 1942 version in gorgeous Technicolor is rather better. On my seventh birthday I was given a Pan Book paperback entitled Mowgli Stories. The only illustration was on the cover against a vivid dark blue and black background a naked adolescent Mowgli is depicted wielding a flaming red and orange branch in resistance to the villainous tiger Shere Khan, who has come to claim him from the wolf pack. I no longer have that book but my research indicates it was published by Pan Book's in 1948. The paperback contained all eight of the Mowgli stories in roughly serial order taken from a miscellaneous collection of stories found in The Jungle Book and The Second Jungle Book. Although the movie's longer title is Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book, it does not deserve to have Kipling's name attached to it. The Mowgli tales as Kipling wrote them are far superior to the weak screenplay of the film which diverges widely from the original and develops an entirely new set of characters. Would a late Victorian army colonel really contemplate his only daughter marrying even a refined native boy in those days? I think not. One may forgive easily forgive the numerous careless goofs. After all it is Walt Disney stuff not a documentary about British India in late Victorian times or whether the fuel containers on the horse cart should have the word paraffin or kerosene stencilled on them etc. However, I have seen far worse gaffs in some otherwise praiseworthy Oscar-winning movies, such asLawrence of Arabia. I wonder if one day somebody will make a new non-cartoon film entitled The Mowgli Stories which is much more faithful to them than what has been produced so far. It probably could not be contained in a time span of less than three hours and who would want to sit in a cinema theatre that long anyway? Perhaps the best way of presenting the Mowgli stories on screen as Rudyard Kipling envisioned them would be to produce an eight-episode made for TV series. Okay, I have grouched enough. In fairness, I enjoyed the film as it stands. After all my objections why do I give it a 7\/10? First the cinematography and staged scenery were good quality, second animal handling was well done and third the cast was excellent. The lead star, Jason Lee Jones was first rate, just right for the part. Several Indian commentators on this site have disliked the fact that Jason is not an Indian and they also claim he does not even look like one. This is rather a pointless objection in my view. India (without Pakistan and Bangladesh) has about 1.2 billion human inhabitants and a long history of invasion and conquests with much interbreeding. Thus there are numerous tribes, ethnics and races in India. Indians themselves display a range of complexions from the ebony black of a Tamil to the light olive skins of a Mediterranean person further north. Jason reminds me of many Bengalis I have known where slightly Mongoloid features are common. To ignore the physical diversity of its inhabitants would be to deny India's cultural, ethnic and racial diversity which makes that country so interesting. Instead, I would have thought that Indians would more likely to have objected to the way they are depicted in the movie, either as rather silly or villainous. In fairness several of the British officers are depicted as silly and\/or villainous as well.Downgrading natives was definitely not Kipling's style. In the Jungle Books and his novel Kim Rudyard Kipling reveals a true love of greater India and its people and culture. He was one of the few intelligent imperialists (called Empire Builders until well into the 1950s) who sought to understand the local cultures in whatever corner of the Empire they found themselves assigned for years. The could either isolate themselves in compounds or mingle. Kipling mingled and studied the cultures and manners of Her Majesty's exotic subjects though as a man of his day he did not commit the sin of going native. As the film is deliberately light-hearted Disney stuff bordering on comedy one could even accept John Cleese portraying - as he did in the Monty Python films and as Basil in the Fawlty Towers TV show- a very silly, uncouth, and highly satirical Englishman. One final point I need to make is that in my view the movie should have been rated PG-13 rather than PG. There are some particularly ugly scenes including man eaten by a tiger, by implication only, in one instance or another explicitly mauled to death by Shere Khan. That is scary stuff for a small child. Worse are scenes of a soldier slowing sinking to his death in a quagmire, an Indian bad guy being squashed by man-trapping devices and another man drowned in slow motion. Also young children tend to become very upset if animals are hurt or killed. There is a scene where an animal is shot and depicted to be in great pain.

They stumble upon The Book of the Dead, which is inked in blood and bound by flesh, and unleashes a number of demons and evil spirits that quickly begin to take over the cabin and the souls inside. It's up to Ash, the cool-guy hero of the group to defeat the spirits and save his friends.The plot is, without a doubt, as standard as standard can get. At the end of the day, we come for the scares and the gore and that's exactly what we'll receive. Buckets and buckets of blood are utilized; one of the best scenes involves Ash puncturing a demon's eyes with both his thumbs, with huge amounts of blood quickly oozing out. Yet even with all this constant, flashy violence and gore, the film never veers off on the course of being sadistically exploitative or depressingly nihilistic. Its gore and violence isn't meant to be taken seriously or offensively. There's an aesthetic and tonal cheeriness to this material that is widely unexpected - especially in the eighties, when it seemed many horror films attempted to be as bleak as they possibly could be.Director Sam Raimi (who would later become known for not only his Evil Dead trilogy, but his Spider-Man films) knows how to employ terrific tactics when he works on horror movies. His presence and involvement with the 1980's horror film Intruder, while one of his more obscure films, definitely replicates a style that he would soon become affiliated with. Here, Raimi always seems to be trying something new, specifically with the camera angles.

The trick to these scenes is we never know exactly what the POV is of, but we don't need to. We know it's not good, since it zips by at an unusual, lighting speed and makes the characters scream when they come in contact with it.These scenes work because Raimi largely knows when to utilize them and how to have them work accordingly with the cinematography.

As a horror film, it features the obligatory faceless characters, little development, and devotion to smaller events that may or may not lead up to a grandiose finale. And yet, it works mainly because it aspires to be a bit more ambitious in the regards to its film techniques and gore usage.

It deals with a young man named Keong (Jackie Chan) visiting and helping his uncle in New York City finds himself forced to fight a street gang and the mob with his martial art abilities . His uncle has a local Chinese supermarket, which he owns and is in the process of selling to Elaine (Anita Mui). Later on , Keong befriends a neighbor kid and his sister (Francois Yip) and beats up some neighborhood thugs .Hong Kong\/US\/Canada action comedy full of over-the-top struggles , excitement , thrills , ingenious stunts , slapstick , lots of brawls but with abundant humor and tongue-in-cheek . This fun movie is plenty of intrigue , unstopped action , and overwhelming stunt-work with breathtaking ending images including a hovercraft . Jackie Chan is top notch as one army man fighting a group of heinous villains and as always he makes his own stunts like is well showed at the final credits . Awesome , incredible stunts and brief comic touches , as usual ; the picture is better constructed than Chan's predecessors films . The lighting-paced storyline slows down at times , but frantic action sequences make up for it . Spotlights movie include spectacular fights , including bounds and leaps , impressive and interminable struggles , an impressive final struggle between Jackie Chan and enemies . The warehouse fight scene took twenty days to film, with Chan having to teach the local stunt players to fight Hong Kong style. In addition other fine action sequences in overwhelming and extraordinary style . The script called for a leap from the top of a parking lot to a fire escape on the floor below on the building across the street , as is his custom, director Stanley Tong attempted the stunt before asking any actors to do so. He tried it with the help of a cable harness, but quickly decided it would be safer without the harness. The landing point was not visible from the point where the jump began, so tape was placed on the take-off point as a guide ,the jump was completed perfectly by 'Chan, Jackie' on the first attempt, doing his own stunts as is his custom . The jump was captured by four cameras. This is an acceptable action movie distinguished by nicely cinematography of the spectacular sequences , and contains agreeable sense of humor as well as previous entries . Jackie Chan usually forms couple to notorious actresses as Maggie Chung and Michelle Yeoh . In this outing Jackie teams up to gorgeous Francoise Yip (who broke her leg while filming the scene where she rides a motorbike across the tops of parked cars , she insisted on returning to the set after her leg was plastered at hospital) and prestigious Chinese actress Anita Mui , a fine action star in their own right but sadly she early died by cancer . Both of them starred together several films such as ¨Mr Canton and Lady Rose¨ and ¨Legend of the drunken master¨ . Filming in Vancouver, Canada on October 6th, 1994, Chan broke his right ankle while attempting the scene where he jumps onto the hovercraft. Despite the injury, he was present at the premiere of ¨The legend of the drunken fighter¨ at the Vancouver International Film Festival that night. Later in the production, Tong sprained his ankle, completing the film on crutches . Two stunt women also broke their legs during the filming of the motorcycle chase. The picture achieved big success in China , USA and all around the world . However , Jackie Chan's failed at Box-office in his American debut ,¨Battle creek brawl¨ . Chan is a hard-working actor and director throughout his long and varied career . Chan usually pays overt homage to two of his greatest influences as Charles Chaplin and Harold Lloyd . He went on playing ¨Cannoball¨ , ¨The protector¨ and Rumble in the Bronx, until getting all American success with ¨Shangai Knights¨ , ¨The tuxedo¨ , ¨Around the world in 80 days¨ and ¨Rush hour¨ trilogy , and the recent ¨Karate kid¨. Of course , his biggest hits were ¨The Police story¨ series that won the Golden Horse Award, a Chinese version of the Oscar , the first was titled ¨Police story (1985)¨ directed by the same Chan , it was a perfect action film for enthusiastic of the genre ; the following was ¨Police story 2 (1988)¨ also pretty violent and with abundant humor touches . It's followed by ¨Supercop¨ or ¨Police story 3¨ and finally , ¨Police story IV  Crime story¨ . The picture is well produced by the great Asian producer Raymond Chow and Golden Harvest production and compellingly directed by Stanley Tong and helped by Jackie Chan . Rating  Acceptable and passable , the picture has its sensational moments here and there , but also with abundant humor touches mostly provided by its agile star , the super Jackie stunningly accompanied by Anita Mui and Francois Yip . It's a perfect action film for enthusiasts of the genre and especially for Jackie fans .

It deals with a young man named Keong (Jackie Chan) visiting and helping his uncle in New York City finds himself forced to fight a street gang and the mob with his martial art abilities . His uncle has a local Chinese supermarket, which he owns and is in the process of selling to Elaine (Anita Mui). Later on , Keong befriends a neighbor kid and his sister (Francois Yip) and beats up some neighborhood thugs .Hong Kong\/US\/Canada action comedy full of over-the-top struggles , excitement , thrills , ingenious stunts , slapstick , lots of brawls but with abundant humor and tongue-in-cheek . This fun movie is plenty of intrigue , unstopped action , and overwhelming stunt-work with breathtaking ending images including a hovercraft . Jackie Chan is top notch as one army man fighting a group of heinous villains and as always he makes his own stunts like is well showed at the final credits . Awesome , incredible stunts and brief comic touches , as usual ; the picture is better constructed than Chan's predecessors films . The lighting-paced storyline slows down at times , but frantic action sequences make up for it . Spotlights movie include spectacular fights , including bounds and leaps , impressive and interminable struggles , an impressive final struggle between Jackie Chan and enemies . The warehouse fight scene took twenty days to film, with Chan having to teach the local stunt players to fight Hong Kong style. In addition other fine action sequences in overwhelming and extraordinary style . The script called for a leap from the top of a parking lot to a fire escape on the floor below on the building across the street , as is his custom, director Stanley Tong attempted the stunt before asking any actors to do so. He tried it with the help of a cable harness, but quickly decided it would be safer without the harness. The landing point was not visible from the point where the jump began, so tape was placed on the take-off point as a guide ,the jump was completed perfectly by 'Chan, Jackie' on the first attempt, doing his own stunts as is his custom . The jump was captured by four cameras. This is an acceptable action movie distinguished by nicely cinematography of the spectacular sequences , and contains agreeable sense of humor as well as previous entries . Jackie Chan usually forms couple to notorious actresses as Maggie Chung and Michelle Yeoh . In this outing Jackie teams up to gorgeous Francoise Yip (who broke her leg while filming the scene where she rides a motorbike across the tops of parked cars , she insisted on returning to the set after her leg was plastered at hospital) and prestigious Chinese actress Anita Mui , a fine action star in their own right but sadly she early died by cancer . Both of them starred together several films such as ¨Mr Canton and Lady Rose¨ and ¨Legend of the drunken master¨ .

The Man with the Golden Gun for some time was considered the worst Bond film (along with A View to a Kill), until Die Another Day came along anyway. As with most of Roger Moore's films, they were either hit or miss, and this one really was a miss because of yet another confused plot that hadn't chose the subject it wanted to really focus on (much like Diamonds are Forever).In the opening sequence, a Las Vegas hit-man is hired and sent to kill master assassin Francisco Scaramanga (Scene stealing Christopher Lee). Scaramanga is too good, however, and kills the Hit-man with his iconic Golden gun. Subsequently, Bond is sent a bullet with '007' on it, and this is traced to Scaramanga. Bond and MI6 naturally assume that Scaramanga wants to kill him, so Bond is sent to kill Scaramanga first. And this is where the plot loses it. It turns out that Scaramanga doesn't care about Bond really, and in fact respects him. Instead, this is all about some 'solex agitator' that can turn sunlight into electricity. Scaramanga has this agitator, and uses it in a laser to blow things up, and wants to sell it to the highest bidder. This, mixed in with some cartoonish action scenes (complete with scene-wrecking cartoonish sound effects), ruins this film and it's a dreadful shame.This film should never have included the solex agitator and the whole 'electricity' thing. This should have focused on Scaramanga and Bond in a face-off. That would have made for a stronger, more believable plot, and it would have played to the strength that this film had, which was the wise casting of Christopher Lee as Scaramanga. If it wasn't for him, this would be truly dreadful. As it is, Moore does an all right job, but Lee really does haul it up a notch as best he can. This doesn't even make the most of the Bond girls. Maud Adams is far better than Britt Eckland, who suffers because of her poorly written part. This is much like Diamonds are Forever. It's good for sitting and watching aimlessly with something alcoholic, but it's not good enough for much else. 5\/10.

It may not be the most iconic (that title goes to Goldfinger), but it is the Bond film with the most realistic plot, the most realistic settings, the most realistic villains, the most realistic gadgets, and the most realistic portrayal of the Bond character by Sean Connery. It also boasts the first Bond 'Pre-credits' sequence.In many respects, the difference between Dr No and From Russia with Love is simply the budget. Dr No wasn't taken all that seriously, but following it's huge success, the producers were given more money and it does show on the screen throughout the film. SPECTRE, who are mourning the loss of their agent Dr No, come up with a plan that would enable them to lay their hands on a Russian Decoding device, the 'Lektor'. Master Planner Kronsteen (played by the creepy Vladek Shaybal), Russian defector Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya) and the infamous Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Anthony Dawson as the body, Eric Pohlman as the voice), want to use James Bond to steal the decoding device, before killing him and selling it back to the Russians, making money, avenging Dr No and discrediting MI6 all at the same time. . Bond is naturally sent after the Lektor by MI6, who know that he is walking into a trap set by Klebb and Bond girl Tatiana, but must know if they can get the Lektor. Along the way, as always, Bond makes a friend in ally Ali Kerim Bay, who helps him steal the lektor and remove it from Turkey. Bond is also helped by SPECTRE henchman 'Grant' (Robert Shaw) so he can get the Lektor later on. The plan is foolproof - except, and Klebb later says they were dealing with BondThe location of Istanbul is superb. In terms of beauty, it's a stunning location with some fabulous action pieces (the attack on Kerim's HQ, the Russian embassy scene just to name two), but is also benefits from the realism of the Cold War setting - Istanbul was a key gateway between the Capitalist west, and the communist east. The action scenes are very well filmed, and entirely believable in execution. You could genuinely believe that this could be real, unlike Dr No where the villain was more cartoonish than grounded.This also benefits from very strong casting in terms of Bond allies and villains. Pedro Armendáriz is instantly likable as Kerim Bay, who you know is loyal and brave (and has many sons!). He set another standard as a Bond ally - one who was as committed and as fearless as Bond himself, and not just a second to Bond. In the same way, Lotte Lenya as Klebb was a masterclass as a villain because you just hate her for what you know she is - a traitor. That said, the man who shines here is Robert Shaw as 'Grant', who even now is the best villain that Bond has to face. A cold, fearless psychopath, Grant stops at nothing to get what he wants, and only Shaw could have acted this role without it becoming catoonish in its way. The fight between him and Bond is the best fight in any Bond film. No, there is no cartoonish super-villain. And no, there are no amazing gadgets with the exception of the briefcase. But whatever this film lacks in now typical Bond-esque villains, Bond sets and over-reaching plots, it gains considerably with grounded realism, a very tight plot, some genuinely brilliant acting and action set pieces. It also introduces us to the idea of a realistic criminal organisation in the form of SPECTRE (more-so that Dr No, where it's not necessarily believable), and to super-villain Blofeld.The best James Bond film.

I think that Roger Moore is an acquired taste, but I do like him in the role, even if he's and the films he starred in were hit and miss. Live and Let Die is a hit, fortunately, and plays to Roger Moore's strengths rather than his weaknesses. Several MI6 agents have been murdered in America, and an island called San Monique. MI6 suspect DR Kananga, the leader of the island of San Moniqu, is responsible. James Bond is called into action, and sent to New York to begin his investigations. He soon discovers that Dr Kananga is involved in drugs and voodoo in Harlem, and also New Orleans and the island of San Monique. Naturally, Dr Kananga can't allow Bond to stop this, and he tries to kill him several times in several different ways. Bond escapes each time, and is finally able to beat Kananga in a suitably over-the-top way that only Moore could get away with. So, was Moore a good replacement? My opinion is that he was, but he is very different. Connery's strength was his ruthless streak, Lazenby's strength was his sensitivity, Moore's strength was his ability to make comical ideas seem ever so slightly plausible. Voodoo on a Bond film? Wouldn't have worked at all with any other actor other than Moore. Somehow, Moore makes it works and goes a good job of it. This also benefits from a real return to some very good action scenes. The boat chase in Louisiana is first rate, and I think the best Bond stunt is in this film, where stuntman Ross Kananga (the villain was named after him) runs over live crocodiles to get away. Paul McCartney's first rate score (possibly one of the best) also adds to the action, and the showdown is fun. No, it's not serious, and no, it's not Connery.

No money to light with? Use shadows and let the viewer's mind infer.

Now I get that he's an excited new Father, but please, 3x? Does nothing.Plus the pregnant-pause\/false ending conceit that run throughout. Do we need that? Not clever and gets old fast.

The game was one of the best selling titles of the 80's and the games are still played to this day.So how well does it translate to film? In a nutshell, not very well but it's a wholeheartedly innocent attempt at any rate.I first saw the film at the Cinema when I was about 15 in 1993 and I came away sort of enjoying it. I think it's down to the fact that around that time people were becoming savvy to Hollywood botching film versions of established stories like comics and such. When I walked into that theatre I had absolutely no expectations about the film being true to the source material or any kind of notion that it would be really any good, and with that I sat down and was entertained for the duration.The bad points about the film is that is just dripping with studio exec. interference. This is a cheaply made film aimed at kids, not a kids film you understand. Goonies, Neverending Story etc. these are great kids films but a film aimed at kids is a whole different story.It's a gimmiky adventure film that bungles it's way through the story with a truly awful script, utterly dumbed down that's actually quite insulting to intelligent children. It's painful at times to see Dennis Hopper and Bob Hoskins, two of the great actors of modern time, deliver their goofy lines from the moronic screenplay.The film is cheap and it shows. Very bad special effects, sets and costumes don't add to the action but surprisingly it comes away with a certain feel which I found appealing. The goofy music that plays throughout and irritating 'boing' sound effects seal the coffin lid shut in a final insult to the viewers intelligence. Super Mario Brothers isn't a film you'd watch more than once, or even a guilty pleasure. It's the sort of film you would possibly put on to keep a bunch of 3 year old children happy for a bit.My review must seem scathing so far but I will say, it does have it's small moments. The Goomba (who looks nothing like their game counterparts) elevator scene just made me smile and certain scenes towards the beginning of the film seem genuine enough.As far as I know the director wanted to make the film much darker but was thwarted by the men in suits who wanted a kid friendly money maker and in knowing that I believe that the actors and crew did what they did with no malice intended and that sort of comes through a touch and this blameless feeling is what carries the film for the most part.I can't see how anyone could really hate this film, bad as it is!

It has James Bond as we know him, it has the super-villain, it has the Bond girl, it has the locations, it has the allies and the enemies and it has that little bit of Bond magic that somehow allows us to like a sexist, callous womaniser who kills people!When two British communications agents are ruthlessly murdered in Jamaica (a previous British colony, and for some time the home of Bond create Ian Fleming), specialist MI6 operative James Bond is sent to the island to investigate. Upon arrival, he discovers that the murders of the agents were part of a cover-up into the activities of the mysterious Dr Julius No, who owns a secretive island. Carefully weaving his way into the lives of villains (Professor Dent - the first villainous Henchman, and Miss Taro, the insider at Government House), to the allies (Felix Liter, the CIA regular, and ill-fated Quarell), he sets about unravelling the mystery of Dr No, also finding his first Bond girl, the now iconic Honey Ryder and leading to the classic Bond-esque showdown between super-villain and spy.At the time, this was seen as a bit of a joke.

Ever since I was a kid, this red and blue, wall crawling arachnid has also been the superhero I saw myself in, the superhero I can see myself portraying. When the 2002 film starring Tobey Maguire came along, I was as excited as a leprechaun locked in a chamber full of beer. This superb superhero flick is up there on my favorite superhero film list and even if sequels have come along as well as a stellar reboot, this film still holds a special place in my heart. This is a shining jewel in the comic book based movie category and when it comes to Spidey films, this is a feast fit for any Spidey fan. The comic book look and feel of the film must be praised. Sam Raimi and his team surely came through in delivering a great comic panel to silver screen transition and making us feel like we were watching a comic book come to life. From the New York skyscrapers to the abandoned warehouse to the film's web slinging scenes, you really feel like your sucked into the motion picture and every, jaw dropping moment. You feel like a piece of the pie, and this film is a pie that will make any comic book guru go bonkers. This film hearkens back to the great Steve Ditko stories of the golden age of comics and really delivers a scope and feeling of epicness. Spider- Man is mighty and the actor portraying him is radical. Tobey Maguire gives us a more serious Spider-Man than the wise cracking one seen in the panels of the comics, but he still has a touch of humor here and there and really fits in Spidey's shoes perfectly. When it comes to playing Spidey's alter ego, Peter Parker, Tobey also hits a home run and really portrays him as an average ordinary everyday teenager. Many people, including myself can relate to Maguire's take on Parker\/Spidey, for he plays him as a realistic, determined fellow just trying to make his way in the world. William Dafoe is great as the Green Goblin, giving us a menacing and hilarious villain who loves being villainous. I will admit, his costume is a bit ridiculous, but it's not the worst I've ever seen. It's a lot better looking than Halle Berry's Catwoman, that's for sure! The other actors are also good in their aliases. James Franco is a rebellious, yet headstrong Harry Osborn and Rosemary Harris is a sweet, grandmotherly Aunt May (More wheat cakes, Petey?). Kirsten Dunst is as Mary Jane as you can get, although she can be a little petulant at times, especially in the later films. And of course, the great Bruce Campbell in all his glory makes an appearance. Him and Sam Raimi are like peanut butter and jelly, and Campbell always knows how to make his cameos work, giving us brief, yet funny and memorable moments. Did anyone see his cameo in the latest Oz movie? Overall, Spider-Man is a fun, whirling and twirling action packed suspense thriller that will have you entangled in it's awesomeness ever second. Honestly, I could sit here for countless hours talking about the grand action scenes, the iconic dialogue, and the cheesy, yet comic book inspired special effects, but IMDb has a limit, and I gotta keep it short. Spider-Man is just a head spinning ride of unexpectedness and epicness, but doesn't hold a candle to the sequel that would follow two years later. We'll get to that one some other time.

Sadly, this film and the quality of the finish really does reflect the producer's desperation to capitalize on it, and Moonraker slips into the reals of farce, though not as badly as it might have done if it had not been for some decent action scenes before the entrance into space.A space shutting belonging to Hugo Drax is stolen in mid-air, and because it happened on MI6's watch, Bond is sent to investigate. Bond discovers very quickly that Drax himself is behind the theft, and must quickly find out why. This takes him to Venice, where he discovers a laboratory that is manufacturing a very deadly nerve gas that harms only humans. He immediately reports this, and M visits himself, only to find that Drax has had the whole place cleared up as part of a cover up. Bond then travels ti Rio, where with the help of CIA agent Holly Goodhead, they discover the Drax is moving things further into the Amazon for a secret reason. He also discovers that his old foe, Jaws, is alive and well and now working for Drax. Eventually, Bond and Goodhead find themselves at a secret launch base in the Amazon, where they are blasted into Space because Drax has a large space station there, where he can kill everyone on Earth and repopulate it. As you can tell, this plot doesn't cut it. Yes, Connery nearly made it to Space in You only Live Twice, but that film had a far stronger plot than Moonraker, which leaves far, far too many holes in it's plot, and has too much farce (the double take on the pigeon, the classical music during Venice, the jokey CIA gadgets). Ultimately, it just loses the point. The plot is just to thin, and offers absolutely nothing new to the franchise even with Bond going into Space (an idea too far for a spy, I think). Still, this is not without some good points, thankfully. There are some great actions scenes between the rubbish. The fight between Bond and Chang in Venice is first rate, as is the Cable Car fight between Bond and Jaws. There's also a reasonable boat chase, though you do feel that it's a bit of a rehash of older Bonds, rather than a fresh Bond film.Another positive note is the villain, Hugo Drax, who I do rather like because of his understated, totally ruthless outlook. Look after Mr Bond. See that some harm comes to him. A good line, from a decent villain. A nice laugh for Sunday afternoon, I think. 6\/10.

As you can tell, this plot doesn't cut it. Yes, Connery nearly made it to Space in You only Live Twice, but that film had a far stronger plot than Moonraker, which leaves far, far too many holes in it's plot, and has too much farce (the double take on the pigeon, the classical music during Venice, the jokey CIA gadgets). Ultimately, it just loses the point. The plot is just to thin, and offers absolutely nothing new to the franchise even with Bond going into Space (an idea too far for a spy, I think). Still, this is not without some good points, thankfully. There are some great actions scenes between the rubbish. The fight between Bond and Chang in Venice is first rate, as is the Cable Car fight between Bond and Jaws. There's also a reasonable boat chase, though you do feel that it's a bit of a rehash of older Bonds, rather than a fresh Bond film.Another positive note is the villain, Hugo Drax, who I do rather like because of his understated, totally ruthless outlook. Look after Mr Bond. See that some harm comes to him. A good line, from a decent villain. A nice laugh for Sunday afternoon, I think. 6\/10.

Sadly, this film and the quality of the finish really does reflect the producer's desperation to capitalize on it, and Moonraker slips into the reals of farce, though not as badly as it might have done if it had not been for some decent action scenes before the entrance into space.A space shutting belonging to Hugo Drax is stolen in mid-air, and because it happened on MI6's watch, Bond is sent to investigate. Bond discovers very quickly that Drax himself is behind the theft, and must quickly find out why. This takes him to Venice, where he discovers a laboratory that is manufacturing a very deadly nerve gas that harms only humans. He immediately reports this, and M visits himself, only to find that Drax has had the whole place cleared up as part of a cover up. Bond then travels ti Rio, where with the help of CIA agent Holly Goodhead, they discover the Drax is moving things further into the Amazon for a secret reason. He also discovers that his old foe, Jaws, is alive and well and now working for Drax. Eventually, Bond and Goodhead find themselves at a secret launch base in the Amazon, where they are blasted into Space because Drax has a large space station there, where he can kill everyone on Earth and repopulate it.
