Keith Gordon was a good actor, but it is as director that he has really developed his talent. This excellent drama is the best proof of that. Billy Crudup and Jennifer Connelly are marvelously matched as the tragic couple who are divided by their political views and also religion. Crudup plays Fielding, a Protestant middle-class boy who is a naval officer and has political aspirations. Connelly is Sarah, a Catholic girl who is a radical leftist activist. Her unabashed anti-conservative views clash with those of Fielding and his associates and threaten to destroy their relationship. Still it survives, because their love is too strong to be destroyed. It all comes to a sudden end when Sarah is killed by a car bomb while in Chile, trying to help the imprisoned anti-Pinochet activists. Fielding is devastated by his loss and buries himself in his political career.The ending is open to several interpretations. Is it Sarah's ghost that he sees or has she somehow gone unharmed and come back in flesh? This is what makes this film so good. It is a roller-coaster of emotions, an emotional odyssey that Fielding goes through. And I think it raises one important question-can one go back to his old self even after so many things have changed? It is as much about inner confrontation as a love story that transcends time. Billy Crudup is outstanding here and he makes this film work. This film would be wasted with a weaker actor in the leading role, I believe. Same goes for Jennifer Connelly and her role. They have an awesome chemistry which makes them so believable as a love couple. Ed Harris also makes an appearance here, although it is very short unfortunately. Other actors make a fine supporting cast and I especially enjoyed Fielding's interaction with his father, it was important for the whole story and the film.This is about giving up the ghost, accepting the truth that the one you loved is gone from your life and can never return. This is what the ending is about really. That and keeping that love inside you.

Clarissa Starling has been hung out to dry by her superiors for a drug raid that got violent. A raid, that she disapproved of, where 4 violent criminals were killed off, one of them being a black woman crime lordess who had her baby when she was shot dead, while she was shooting at Clarissa. Never mind, the baby was unharmed and the raid was executed without her approval and against her orders. It was compared to Waco by the news and her superiors, why? Were 80 odd cultists burned alive after a long siege? And this in a Mamet, no Zallian screenplay. One of her bureaucratic tormentors, played by Ray Liotta, is a future victim too. In ten years since her debut, she has learned to be really rude and nasty, especially to her coworkers and superiors, no more nice little small town girl.Hannibal, after the Silence of the Lamb, has escaped to Italy where he is living the artsy fartsy good life doing some sort of appraisal work. He is being tracked down by a Mason Verger, a degenerate, crippled, disfigured ex child molester who is super rich. You see, Verger was Hannibal's only victim who lived and he is so super rich, he has a palatial Virginian estate and his own highway to it.The story shifts gears and goes over Italy for more artsy cannibalism and gore. Needless to say, Hannibal increased his body edible count. Of course, all his victims have some sort of defect of character, far less than Hannibal though. So we are supposed to identify with Hannibal like Clarissa does again. She helps rescue him from some justified vengeance and get even more people killed, including Verger. But ex-child molesters are more heinous than cannibals in this world. This is because they have bonded in some Platonic love and ampathy so that Hannibal sacrifices part of himself to spare her, after doing in her bureaucratic tormentor in a real medically sadistic scene.There is nothing enlightening or satisfying in this installment. I compare this to Natural Born Killers in its glorification of charismatic but utterly depraved killers. At least NBK was so over the top it was hard to take seriously, as this film aimed at. I mean, with Mamet doing the screenplay and Sir Ridley Scott directing, plus a huge budget, what are we supposed to make of this? Are we, the public and audience, so depraved that we should invoke sympathy for a depraved killer cause his victims are less than innocent and he has intelligence and a taste in Renaissance art?

Ingredients for a film that may sound pretty dire to the everyday film-goer but all mixed up together combined with some great acting, direction and cinematography result in Leaving Las Vegas leaving you wanting more of the same.What gripped me throughout was the way the film was shot and the way the story was told clearly the film-makers realised that they're not going to be able to carry an hour and a half to two hour film based solely on the premise of 'a man goes to Las Vegas to drink himself to death' and thus need to space everything out in some sort of way. Also, given the fact that any hint of conflict that may arise on Sera's (Shue) behalf is gotten rid of after the first ten minutes (when her pimp tells her to leave him alone forever); I really wondered which direction the film was going to take - and so it brings me onto the ideas behind the approach. Leaving Las Vegas is shot like a mixture between a documentary, a docudrama and an out and out art film. The film carries a very grainy look; there are jump cuts to suggest a break away from 'the norm.'; there are flashbacks shot in black and white and a real all round sense of emphasis on the visual. This twinned with the fact Sera is delivering, what seems like answers to questions at various points, suggests a very alternative approach when it comes to making films. Thus, this approach feels like you're watching a documentary.The idea behind one man who has just about lost everything, with anything that he hasn't lost merely lying outside his now abandoned house for the garbage men or anyone who wants what's inside, is nothing particularly new and yet it's like using the 'one last job' idea for a crime film without actually having the protagonist be approached by anyone with a job they must seek it out and find it themselves. Consequently, Leaving Las Vegas feels very much like a dream or a computer game where the narrative is not obvious and is not going to follow any set route when people dream, it's down to them what you dream of likewise in computer games that have multiple angles of fulfilling a goal it's down to the player to choose a set route and this is what Leaving Las Vegas does; it shreds the narrative idea and lets everything happen. Who could've guessed that after all the un-nerving build up involving Sera and her pimp that a mere five minutes later we would be saying goodbye to him? That's where I thought the conflict would come from. Who could've guessed that when Ben (Cage) arrives in Las Vegas, he just continues doing what he did in L.A.? Obviously the idea is 'he goes to Las Vegas to drink himself to death' but we don't know that when we're watching the film, do we.What was especially clever was the film's neo-realistic approach. We get all the obligatory Las Vegas iconography of gambling and casinos and yet the real emphasis is on real life situations and drama thanks to this film, you get to see what happens (if you haven't already done so!) when you call a prostitute to your motel room you get to hear what people say; see what people wear; what the surroundings might look like and how it plays out. Sometimes there are no incidents at all like in Ben's case; sometimes there are other cases where a bunch of horny kids want to video it &#150; it's all real and unpredictable, or at least it feels like it.Something that I only realised after the film was the importance of the brief segments at random points in the film involving Sera and her 'interview' with us. We never see the interviewer and she isn't looking directly at us and yet we feel she is actually telling us the story if she's telling us these events happened in the past, where's Ben now? Also, the focus gradually and cleverly changes from Ben and his starting of a new life in Las Vegas to Sera herself half way through the relationship &#150; does the 'protagonist' change half way through the film? How often does that happen in Hollywood cinema? Although Ben is always drunk and Sera is a prostitute, the film doesn't promote alcoholism or prostitution, merely showing them as means of escape or survival &#150; if Sera didn't sell herself, she'd be dead and Ben's situation is more tragic than it is funny this is why Ben's drunken antics and speech don't make us laugh in the same way drunk people in film usually do or are usually supposed to; because it's sad to see. I think Sera learns to love Ben but Ben seems too drunk half the time to even realise or even love her back and that is the film's real tragedy.

There've been a number of films that explore the passion for success on the stage Stage Door (1937) and A Star Is Born (first made in 1937 and made several times thereafter) being two of the most notable. And, other films have also taken an introspective look at the machinations of the acting profession &#150; The Player (1992) and even the goofy, but entertaining, Get Shorty (1995).This one, however, is the definitive voyeuristic analysis of why actors will do anything to get to the top, for three reasons. First, it has a script that is flawless in its construction, logic and plot development; to use a hackneyed phrase &#150; it all hangs together seamlessly, showing &#150; and telling, with three different voice-overs &#150; the depths to which some go to reach the heights of narcissistic glory. Second, such a film required a strong hand to keep the actors in check, to prevent it from descending into farce, and that's why Joe Mankiewicz was needed; well, it was his script, anyway &#150; so who better to direct, with his fine record of films? And, third, the main protagonists never before, I think, has a script followed so closely the juxtaposition of a true star (Bette Davis) in her waning years, playing an actress in her waning years, and being challenged by a relative newcomer (Anne Baxter), playing a newcomer challenging the aging star. Such delicious irony, I think, is rare to see on screen. Add to that, a collection of actors (George Sanders, Gary Merrill, Hugh Marlowe, Celeste Holm, the irrepressible Thelma Ritter) of the time who ably and professionally flesh out a drama about the reality of life in fiction.Perhaps even more interesting than the actual film would have been a documentary filming the action on the sets, as the film was made... One can only dream, I guess, to have been a fly on the wall.A word about the dialog checking the above link for Quotes, I see that all of the lines I rate as some of the best I've heard, all show up in the list &#150; which is, also, one of the longest list of quotable film quotes I've seen. If you're hesitating about seeing this film, just scan through those quotes to get a sense of what is in store.As implied, the direction from Mankiewicz and the acting &#150; particularly Davis, Baxter and Sanders &#150; are riveting. Bette Davis is the personification of diminishing self-confidence as the onset of age dominates and depresses; Baxter is almost sociopathic in her portrayal of naked ambition disguised as sycophantic concern for one and all, but particularly for those who will advance her ambitions; and George Sanders does give the performance of his career and deservedly received the award for Best Supporting Actor. Other actors (Dick Powell or Claude Rains, for example) could have played that role, for sure; Sanders, however, does such a good job, it's a though the character of Addison DeWitt (what a play on word sound &#150; Addison, the wit and critic, given a name that sounds like a New Yorker's disparaging put-down. Was Mankiewicz having a bit of fun at New York's expense?) morphs into George Sanders completely. And, vice-versa...So, treat yourself to a filmic experience that you'll never see repeated &#150; for obvious and sad reasons. But also, this type of narrative is long gone from the Hollywood scene talky movies are box-office death these days, as we all know &#150; unless you're in a Phone Booth (2002) or on a Cellular (2004).One can only hope that nobody attempts a remake of this masterpiece.

There've been a number of films that explore the passion for success on the stage Stage Door (1937) and A Star Is Born (first made in 1937 and made several times thereafter) being two of the most notable. And, other films have also taken an introspective look at the machinations of the acting profession &#150; The Player (1992) and even the goofy, but entertaining, Get Shorty (1995).This one, however, is the definitive voyeuristic analysis of why actors will do anything to get to the top, for three reasons. First, it has a script that is flawless in its construction, logic and plot development; to use a hackneyed phrase &#150; it all hangs together seamlessly, showing &#150; and telling, with three different voice-overs &#150; the depths to which some go to reach the heights of narcissistic glory. Second, such a film required a strong hand to keep the actors in check, to prevent it from descending into farce, and that's why Joe Mankiewicz was needed; well, it was his script, anyway &#150; so who better to direct, with his fine record of films? And, third, the main protagonists never before, I think, has a script followed so closely the juxtaposition of a true star (Bette Davis) in her waning years, playing an actress in her waning years, and being challenged by a relative newcomer (Anne Baxter), playing a newcomer challenging the aging star. Such delicious irony, I think, is rare to see on screen. Add to that, a collection of actors (George Sanders, Gary Merrill, Hugh Marlowe, Celeste Holm, the irrepressible Thelma Ritter) of the time who ably and professionally flesh out a drama about the reality of life in fiction.Perhaps even more interesting than the actual film would have been a documentary filming the action on the sets, as the film was made...

Perhaps they had just gotten over the 60's series, too... and that one at least had the excuse that Batman hadn't really been done before that point. This follows a good film, and one that came close to being that, and, well, from the first lines, you can tell that this can by no means be considered as proper an approach as either of those. This film answered a once big question; would you rather never see your hero, your idol, in a film, or only see him or her done right? Burton got out of the director's chair when he found that his dark, and far more fitting, style of doing these films was not what the studio intended for future entries, and, presumably because he's cheap and easy to rely on for the producers, not making a fuss, Joel Schumacher was brought in. Everything proceeds to disintegrate. The bleak Gotham gains bright, tawdry neon, oh how the production team who created the architecture of the city in the first two must feel. The characterization is turned into superficial moments and lines of dialog. It's clear that Schumacher neither understands nor respects the medium of comic books; S1m0ne, by Andrew Niccol, goes too far in trying to make us laugh at celebrities and those at home who love them, but at least his production does hold truth and satire. We fans, we read comic books, is what we need really more people telling us how stupid they think that is? The presentation of the villains further illustrates it. Two-Face is essentially the Joker, just with only half a face of make-up. Where Nicholson was haunting and grotesque, Lee, in spite of being a very talented actor who I like and respect, and enjoy the work of, merely comes off as a nuisance, not a real threat. A cartoon. The utter lack of respect for the source material is seen in one brief part, mentioned in the Trivia section, where the character does something that not only is inconsistent, but downright goes straight against the very *core* of the personality of him! The Riddler is possibly even worse. I like Carrey, too... he's the very reason I initially watched it. Heck, these actors are almost all talented, only you wouldn't know it from watching this. The acting is overdone. Heck, everything is! Sequences are pushed to the extremes, with far too many colors and too much going on at once. The once well-written dialog is replaced with pitiful one-liners and such. Robin is introduced to this series of Batman, and he's made hip. See the earring? And just look at him hanging up the laundry! What were they *thinking*? The nipples on the suits even bothered Bob Kane himself. The action isn't even particularly exciting. It's such a shame that this actually had potential; there's back-story, motivation and explanation behind the title character, and the original plot(described elsewhere, it might spoil stuff in the film to reveal it here) sounds interesting.

Camera, editing and sound are by no means inspiring, but we *are* talking about Schumacher, here. They get the job done, he gets the job done, that's why the producers like him, that's why he keeps getting work. The effects vary, but many are good. There are a few references that aren't bad.

But I nevertheless decided to watch Enough - twice in the past 24 hours on TNT.I watched it the first time because of a bit of trivia I read here that Lopez used Krav Maga fighting techniques in the movie, and I am a big fan of this form of martial arts.Then I watched the movie again half a day later because it was so realistic and suspenseful.I was motivated to write this review however, not because the movie is so riveting (which it is), but because over 25% of the reviewers here panned the film, and in reading the negative reviews, I felt they had several things in common - they missed the point, they were nit-picking, they were looking for some how-to manual for abused women, and\/or they had no understanding of Krav Maga.Let's take the last one first I saw it repeated several times Slim could not have learned her fighting techniques in a month - she could. In fact, the History Channel has a show in which two guys learn various fighting techniques, and in the end, employ what they learned against real experts. And one of the episodes happened to be about Krav Maga which they learned in about a week and then had to defend against a half dozen soldiers in the Israeli army - all at once.The guy chosen to do the fighting held his own very well.Then there were many complaints about what Slim should have done at each point and how time and circumstances wouldn't allow her to do some things she actually did do. To those people, I'd ask you to watch again and pay closer attention because it mostly all fits. Just one example She did go to the police, she just didn't like the officer's advice. Granted there is a huge problem regarding an alarm, but if that spoiled your fun, you did it to yourself. On the other hand, I'm often furious when movies have people breaking into houses that SHOULD HAVE alarms. Here's a movie where the house has one and the intruder isn't stoppedAnother big gripe is about the acting. The problem here is that people who find themselves in such situations in real life are not typically your Olivier-Hepburn types. They are usually poor to middle class people who have a hard enough time getting through, and their limited abilities and resources are further taxed by the incredible abuse to which they find themselves subjected.So the cast does a decent job of playing average people and I realize full well that at least some may not be acting at all. But that hardly matters since this is a movie about people muddling through.Finally, there was a lot of grumbling about Lopez taking the law into her own hands, but I think these people fail to see that this isn't a film about wife abuse, it's a film about a psychopath who wants what he wants because he wants it, and he's willing to go to any length to force people to conform to his reality, and that, in itself, answers a lot of questions posed by the negative reviewers.So Slim can't follow the normal, civilized path. If she did, sooner or later she'd likely wind up dead. She simply has to force his capitulation. Are all the Ts crossed and Is dotted? No. Might a real-life version of what she did turn out differently? I'd say the chances are 50-50. However, the movie does present one credible version of a woman who does her best to prevail. She relies on men because she has to, and the real question is would real life men be as helpful to a woman in her position as those who asst her in the movie? So watch this movie for what it is, a gritty and tense bit of fiction that, once things start to happen, will grab your attention and keep you entertained.

For some reason the theater sold more tickets than there were seats and some people had to sit on the floor to watch it! I think it was at Westroads Mall in Omaha if I recall....Anyway, Pete's Dragon is a Disney musical full of colorful characters and interesting moments. Is it a classic? Maybe not quite, but any viewer should savor the chance to see a children's film like this since they really aren't made this well any more. The story deals with a young boy on the run from an abusive hillbilly family who bought him for $50 and fifty cents in legal fees. The Gogans as they are called leave little to the imagination about how they wish to abuse young Pete, and he and his animated dragon named Elliot seek refuge in a near by fishing village known as Passamaquady. This dragon is mostly invisible, but he has a playful side. He damages all kinds of property in town, and Pete is blamed since few people actually see the dragon. After a while, a kindly lighthouse keeper and her father take the boy in whilst the dragon moves in to the caves beneath their lighthouse. After a while, the Gogans discover where Pete has gone and they come to collect him. Also complicating matters is the arrival of a doctor and his associate who plan to capture the dragon and sell him off piece by piece to the highest bidder. The charismatic Dr. Terminus is one of those old fashioned quacks who moves from town to town selling mysterious potions that supposedly cure just about anything. Keep in mind the film takes place around one hundred years ago. There are other subplots involving problems with local fishermen, the lighthouse keeper's lost love, and an abusive local school teacher. The problems are all more or less dealt with in one way or another.Overall, this is a very good film. Maybe the two plus hour length is too much for some children, though. There are a LOT of songs, even for a Disney musical. Luckily, many of them are memorable or at least good. The Dragon isn't seen all that much, but when we see him, he looks pretty neat. Donald Bluth & Co did a pretty good job with him. Some plot points might be edgier than the PC world of today would allow. The abusive teacher really enjoys hitting Pete when he attends her class.

For some reason the theater sold more tickets than there were seats and some people had to sit on the floor to watch it! I think it was at Westroads Mall in Omaha if I recall....Anyway, Pete's Dragon is a Disney musical full of colorful characters and interesting moments. Is it a classic? Maybe not quite, but any viewer should savor the chance to see a children's film like this since they really aren't made this well any more. The story deals with a young boy on the run from an abusive hillbilly family who bought him for $50 and fifty cents in legal fees. The Gogans as they are called leave little to the imagination about how they wish to abuse young Pete, and he and his animated dragon named Elliot seek refuge in a near by fishing village known as Passamaquady. This dragon is mostly invisible, but he has a playful side. He damages all kinds of property in town, and Pete is blamed since few people actually see the dragon. After a while, a kindly lighthouse keeper and her father take the boy in whilst the dragon moves in to the caves beneath their lighthouse. After a while, the Gogans discover where Pete has gone and they come to collect him. Also complicating matters is the arrival of a doctor and his associate who plan to capture the dragon and sell him off piece by piece to the highest bidder. The charismatic Dr. Terminus is one of those old fashioned quacks who moves from town to town selling mysterious potions that supposedly cure just about anything. Keep in mind the film takes place around one hundred years ago. There are other subplots involving problems with local fishermen, the lighthouse keeper's lost love, and an abusive local school teacher. The problems are all more or less dealt with in one way or another.Overall, this is a very good film. Maybe the two plus hour length is too much for some children, though.

A lot of film techniques and plot devices have been used (poorly many times) in every movie seen. So the plot twists were not a huge surprise and the deviousness of the situations is not as shocking as it would have been if I grew up in that error. But besides all of that anyone can tell this is an outstanding movie and anyone that appreciates good dialog will love this movie. This movies has some of the quickest and sharp dialog that I have ever heard and was delivered in a way one just does not see anymore. I watched this with my room mate and he commented on how he would never kill for this girl, but I think an idea like that is lost through the ages and he cannot feel the electric draw of Phyllis's character as much as we might have if we grew up in a different generation. Besides that we have a performance with so many nuances that it is hard to catch them all. I think one of my favorite aspects of the character the female lead is she was able to outwit a very smooth talking salesmen who outwits people for a living with a blink of the eye at the very beginning with the dialog about speeding. If that does indicate that she is dangerous than I don't know does. But it is so quick that one may not realize that is the biggest clue that she can outwit all of them. The best part about Walter's character is that he is able to kill her at the end without a blink of the eye and he turns out to be just as evil as her in a way. As she opens up her heart to him he just shoots her. It is brilliant. No one gets the girl and there is not happy ending, but it is very satisfying to watch. The thing I would like to say about the director is that this is probably the best paced movie I have ever seen. It is extremely quick and only lets you breathe for a second and that is only when Walter gets to breathe. Consider there is so little action and it is mostly dialog this is quite a feat to pace it so well. I am glad I have seen this movie and would enjoy multiple viewings. But I think I can only give it a 9 because of the time frame.

It's subtitled An Electronic Odyssey, and indeed, it is, an amazing journey to many places you would not think you'd go.First, it appears to be the story of Leon Termin's invention of the Theremin. It is! It gives us great historical footage, and interviews with his associates and contemporaries. It seems almost comical now that the Theremin would have been promoted as an orchestral instrument (like the previously recently invented saxophone by Adolph Sax), but the interviews are articulate, revelatory and prescient. Thanks for this wonderful history! Next, of course, is what actually became of the Theremin in musical history it became the signature sound of 'spooky' films and of science fiction films in the 1950s. We had the great Franz Waxman's The Bride of Frankenstein (1935) score, which was also used in Flash Gordon (1936), Miklos Rozsa's Spellbound (1945), The Lost Weekend, (1945) and many more even up to Bartleby (2001); then all of the low budget and high budget 50's SF films! The genius Bernard Hermann knew he needed it for The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951), one of the great, defining, SF soundtracks! (For me, The Bride of Frankenstein is the greatest one).The film showcases, and keeps playing, Good Vibrations (1966) by the Beach Boys, apparently to show how the Theremin can be effectively used in music-- much like the slide whistle, chimes, or bells. Bonus points for the extensive 'interview' with the super nutso genius Brian Wilson explaining how 'Good Vibrations' developed. Anybody who's ever taken drugs can understand everything he says! Way to go Brian! Even if you have completely flipped out! We get the great Robert Moog himself describing his love affair with the Theremin, how it works, and its impact on the development of the synthesizer and electronic music!But there's more! Termin is abducted by the Russians in the 1920s, and like a mystery thriller, he is discovered again in the 1990s! The documentary interviews him at age 94, and shows him traveling back to America to receive belated accolades, and to revisit New York City to see how his old haunts, and the city itself, have changed.The last part of the film is a startling film segment for anyone who has ever gotten older. How would you feel traveling back to your old haunts of fifty or sixty years ago? The camera focuses on a bent nonagenarian wandering the alien streets of a New York sixty years in his future. What must he be thinking? What would you be thinking if you were in his place, as you will be in fifty or sixty years? All of a sudden, the film makes you stop and think about the odyssey of your own life, its past, present and the future as looking at the past.

I'm not even exactly sure why, but after a few months have passed and I pop it into the player again, it's like revisiting an old friend. I saw it when it first came out and my feelings toward it haven't changed much since then, when I was 12 years old. One thing I've always been curious about and need to research someday is how much of Rod Serling's original adaptation made it into the final script. The two biographies of him that I've read didn't say much about 'Planet of the Apes.' It seems to me, as someone who loves 'Twilight Zone' and much of Serling's writing, that quite a lot of his script survived. The cynicism, the talkiness, the liberalism, the satirical jabs at organized religion and its inherent hypocrisy, even the nuclear bomb-themed twist ending... all classic Sterling. Certainly Charlton Heston's opening monologue, when he asks, does man, that marvel of the universe, still make war against his brother? could only have been written by Serling. But the whole film pretty much follows the same tone, which again leads me to believe that most of what Serling wrote was left intact; either that, or Michael Wilson (the other credited screenwriter) is a Serling clone! The film itself looks like a medium-budget affair, at best. Most of the sets resemble those of a late-sixties TV movie, or an episode of 'Star Trek.' The special effects are hardly special; just adequate enough to do the job. The real attention-getter when the film came out was the ape make-up, which was considered astoundingly realistic at the time. It's still impressive in its way, allowing for quite a lot of facial expressiveness by the main characters, but like so many technical aspects from that time and before, it will come up lacking and seeming phony to today's younger audiences who have grown up with CGI and other much more dazzling and realistic effects. Heston carries the film; without him, 'Planet of the Apes' would probably seem a lot more foolish than it does. He is bitter, heroic, noble, and cynical; his George Taylor is even at times a Christ-like figure, as when he is stoned by the ape mob and endlessly tied up and taunted by the guards. At its core, 'Planet of the Apes' is a rather heavy-handed spoof of organized religion. Time and again, we hear the elders of the ape community talk about heresy from younger apes who don't understand that the proper study of apes is apes. Man is a soulless animal to them, lacking the divine spark that exists in the simian soul. The point is hammered home again and again that organized religion is narrow-minded, unwilling to accept new ideas even if they're true, and almost always, inevitably, corrupt. The now-famous ending was such a shocker at the time that it somewhat obscured the fact that it was really very downbeat. 'Planet of the Apes' has been called 'near-classic science fiction'; it's a bit too goofy in places to be taken completely seriously, and yet has many powerful moments.

Good to see Martin reunited with the Duke after the great performance he gave as a drunk and a bum in Rio Bravo....Martin had that inate ability to be very good in westerns. The Duke is at his best as the leader of the Elder brothers who must assemble and find out how their mother and father died so suddenly and losing all of their property and possessions. Great shot of the Duke standing on a mountain top as the Elder boys gather around Katie Elders funeral....the Duke standing there looking tall in the saddle so to speak...you got the impression right from the start of this film the Duke would be in control and get his revenge. The Duke goes into town to find some answers with his brothers and runs into roadblocks all over....the Sheriff played by the venerable Paul Fix wants him out of town and quick...the local banker lies and covers up Katie's estate and the man who wants control of the town, James Gregory wants the Duke to hi tail it out of town....to make sure the Duke doesn't cause any trouble he hires a gunslinger to take control.....to make matters worse the sheriff has a very high strung and emotionally out of control deputy who wants to confront the Elders at any opportunity. The town boss, Morgan Hastings kills the sheriff and tries to affix the blame to the Elders.....the deputy buys into it and chases the Elders relentlessly. Problem is the Elders down and out on their luck and out of money agree to go on a cattle drive...the sheriff and Hastings cuthroats follow them into a confrontation....after blowing away Kennedy the Duke and his brothers go back into town to confront Hastings....you know the Duke will nail Hastings to the wall at end....best scene in the film is when a nasty George Kennedy, the hired gun tries to bully the town mortician and the Duke arrives on the scene and smacks Kennedy with a Buford Pusser type block of wood right across the kisser.....plenty of fans in the audience back in the 60s loved that scene....the Duke taking no guff from any gunslinger!!! This is probably one of the Duke's best westerns ever....right up there with She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, Fort Apache, The Searchers, Alamo, True Grit, Rio Bravo and Big Jake.... the Dukes fans will love this western. This is nearly two hours of good, solid entertainment and you will love the Elmer Bernstein musical score. A must for Wayne fans.

It fulfilled the fantasy of those of us who never saw flying saucers-- now we could see and hear them! They are magnificently rendered by Ray Harryhausen, and the sounds they make became the quintessential 'saucer' sound. The title says it all--let the battle begin! We see the saucers right away at the beginning (unlike other SF films of the same period where you never saw 'the monster' until midway through the film) and later we get fantastic destruction of Sacred National Monuments and Institutions (We all were shocked in the theater then!) by the Commies... I mean,the flying saucers. We don't get another good flying saucer movie until the spectacular Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), which is by contrast, far richer and superior on every kind of cinematic level.Unfortunately, the initial exciting attacks here are just a teaser-- EVTFS drags in the middle, and the tension never really builds. Hugh Marlowe as the 'scientist' has no qualms about trying to find a weapon to destroy the aliens and is just too square to be sexy. He also plays 'the chump' boyfriend of Patricia Neal in The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), but is much better as the hero in World Without End (1956).When the alien's face is finally revealed, it looks similar to the 'stereotypical' alien face, like the one in Mission to Mars (2000)! And why does Major Huglin's voice sound so familiar? He was Ronal in Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe (1940) and Paul in The Amazing Dr. X (1948).A bigger budget would have helped; we get stock footage of explosions from Columbia serials. But it's Ray Harryhausen's work that far and away makes this film still watchable. It's also a wonderful time capsule of 1950s flying saucer and Red Menace fears (i.e., when they appear, just shoot first and ask questions later). But I have to give it a 5.

However, I was better satisfied. However, there were still many flaws I encountered while watching that made me think of it as lesser than the original. The story isn't bad. It has a better setting and is simpler to follow. However, the dialogs were what failed. They just sounded too false, too rehearsed. Although it still has the quotable potential like in the original, there are some lines that sound a little out of place. Michael Corleone's character finally redeems himself, now acting as Don Vito would. He's likable and lukewarm, although with a dark past, but still, noble with people. I was at first puzzled with Vincent's presence in the story. Now, real Godfather fans might know that Lucy Mancini never bore a baby with Sonny in the novel, and so Vincent shouldn't even exist. When the story came along together, he grew on me. Yet, I thought his romance with Mary was useless and not very realistic. Joey Zasa was a great character. He should have had more development and not just put as a traitor and have him whacked. I actually felt sympathetic for him. This was one of the reasons I disliked Vincent at the beginning. Connie was what I hated the most from the whole story. Women weren't supposed to tangle with the business in the Family. Puzo specifically explains this in his novel. I regret Tom Hagen's absence. He was the character that, although part of the Family, explained everything to you as a civilian and whom you could feel identified. He was my favorite.Okay, after detailing what I hated, let's move on. Coppola's directing was great. He masterfully uses visual elements from the original and creates new ones that mesh together perfectly. The perfect example was the Archibishop's interview, identical to Bonasera's.

However, there was one thing I thought was the greatest mistake of them all. Corleone dies alone, with his daughter shot (something completely cruel and sad) and with no one else around him but a dog. This is not possible within the Mafia world. A Don never dies alone, nor in the streets. Yet, Al Pacino's performance was the best in the trilogy. The way he cries and screams after his daughter's death is so beautifully done, he makes the viewer cry with him, even though Mary wasn't a very appealing character.So, I liked part III over II, yet, it not nearly as great as The Godfather, which is, till this day, the best movie ever.

No wisecracking glamour-boy hero...no sexy wench disrupting the hero's life. This was a very realistic portrayal of a real miscarriage of justice. The cinematography was almost like a newsreel and came off very realistic and convincing. Vera Miles did a fine job showing the onset of mental illness on an otherwise well-adjusted woman. The police characters were also so well done you in fact sympathized with them - - through their best efforts they were sending an innocent man to prison. The best element of the movie was the frightening illustration of actual arrest, arraignment and incarceration procedures it affects and disturbs you if you put yourself in Manny's shoes more than anything that happens to him; at the outset of the case Manny knows he's a tragic and almost heroic character - taking the wrap for something he didn't do - but senses down deep that this injustice will be recognized and rectified quickly by right-minded cops, citizens, lawyers, judges or journalists; however, when confronted with the mass of men arrested and awaiting trial in that great city, Manny can only conclude that his little case can easily be overlooked and forgotten. Such is the power of the screenplay and the direction. Unfortunately, Henry Fonda's wooden performance tosses a wet washcloth on the gathering fire inside this story and it loses much of its muscularity. Perhaps Fonda was just too old at the time to convince me he has two sons in grammar school. Manny's supposed to be a happily-married man at the beginning of the film, but Henry does a poor job in portraying it. And some of his reactions to being a suspect are so underplayed that you feel he might not even care about it. Still, Fonda's trade-craft does come through and other times and does give us hints of the terror he's experiencing as the false case against him gathers steam - the picture of him grasping the cell's bars as he's first locked in jail is quite powerful.

Could the film makers have been any more prophetic about the future of 'The Greatest' only a couple years before Clay became World Champ for real? That was one of the unexpected treats of the movie for me.The better treat of course was the haunting story of the washed up boxer and the two men closest to him for the past seventeen years, trainer Army (Mickey Rooney) and manager Maish Rennick (Jackie Gleason). It's a pathetically sad one when you get right down to it, exemplified by Maish's betting against his boy for a better payday than the one his fighter will have. It gives further tarnish to the sport's reputation captured by a statement Maish makes to Army - If there was headroom, they'd hold these things in sewers. That's about where Maish climbs up out of following Mountain's loss to Clay, determined to keep him working as a pro wrestler after the doc nixes his future in the boxing ring.Even though I was impressed with Anthony Quinn's performance, I thought he made himself out to be too much of a lummox for my taste. It made the scenes with Julie Harris' character somewhat unbelievable as the pair bordered on a hapless romance of sorts. I suppose it was necessary to capitalize on pulling off the blind loyalty to his manager, even after Mountain realizes he's been made a patsy. I have to give credit to Quinn for coming up with that Don Corleone-ish speech pattern years before Brando made it such a huge hit. As for his looks, the mangled up Quinn looked to be a cross between Charles Laughton's Quasimodo and real pro wrestler Tor Johnson as the Swedish Angel.It was about the time of the movie, 1963 actually, that I became a wrestling fan as most teenagers do. Bruno Sammartino had just become world champion and Haystacks Calhoun was practically a household name. I tried spotting familiar wrestling faces in the movie, but could only come up with a couple of the midgets - Sky Low Low and Fuzzy Cupid. It was neat though seeing Jack Dempsey in a quick cameo as the former champ.You know, just when you think Rod Serling's screenplay has hit the lowest possible depths for the characters of Maish and Rivera, it's a jolt to see Mountain enter the ring at the finale as the Big Chief. You're almost ready to cheer for the fighter thinking he's determined to maintain some dignity in a new profession. Then he goes into the war dance and Indian whoop, and it's like a sock to the gut, a low blow that leaves the viewer scrambling to make some sense out of a blind loyalty that plumbs the depths of despair.

It's a pathetically sad one when you get right down to it, exemplified by Maish's betting against his boy for a better payday than the one his fighter will have. It gives further tarnish to the sport's reputation captured by a statement Maish makes to Army - If there was headroom, they'd hold these things in sewers. That's about where Maish climbs up out of following Mountain's loss to Clay, determined to keep him working as a pro wrestler after the doc nixes his future in the boxing ring.Even though I was impressed with Anthony Quinn's performance, I thought he made himself out to be too much of a lummox for my taste. It made the scenes with Julie Harris' character somewhat unbelievable as the pair bordered on a hapless romance of sorts. I suppose it was necessary to capitalize on pulling off the blind loyalty to his manager, even after Mountain realizes he's been made a patsy. I have to give credit to Quinn for coming up with that Don Corleone-ish speech pattern years before Brando made it such a huge hit. As for his looks, the mangled up Quinn looked to be a cross between Charles Laughton's Quasimodo and real pro wrestler Tor Johnson as the Swedish Angel.It was about the time of the movie, 1963 actually, that I became a wrestling fan as most teenagers do. Bruno Sammartino had just become world champion and Haystacks Calhoun was practically a household name. I tried spotting familiar wrestling faces in the movie, but could only come up with a couple of the midgets - Sky Low Low and Fuzzy Cupid. It was neat though seeing Jack Dempsey in a quick cameo as the former champ.You know, just when you think Rod Serling's screenplay has hit the lowest possible depths for the characters of Maish and Rivera, it's a jolt to see Mountain enter the ring at the finale as the Big Chief. You're almost ready to cheer for the fighter thinking he's determined to maintain some dignity in a new profession. Then he goes into the war dance and Indian whoop, and it's like a sock to the gut, a low blow that leaves the viewer scrambling to make some sense out of a blind loyalty that plumbs the depths of despair.

This coming-of-age story about a young Italian boy growing up in the heart of Little Italy in The Bronx in the 1960's is Robert DeNiro's directorial debut, and it's an auspicious one. Everything about the story rings true; the neighborhood, the mobsters, his family and friends, the gambling; all of it. I visited 187th Street in the Bronx just 2½ months ago, and I could easily imagine everything happening there, even though the bulk of the movie was filmed in Astoria, Queens. I also saw the Broadway play starring Chazz Palmintieri less than 4 weeks ago.The principal character is a young boy named Calagero, and the movie is the story of how his life was molded by his experiences growing up in the neighborhood. Through a serendipitous event, he is befriended by a neighborhood mobster, Sonny, who takes him under his wing. His hard-working bus-driver father opposes the relationship and confronts the gangster at one point. But Calagero's friendship with the gangster continues to flourish through his teen years. As he reaches his mid-teens in the late 60's, his racist friends lean towards troubles beyond the usual teenage rowdiness and try to drag Calagero with them. A large subplot is the interracial romance he pursues with a girl from school. It seems doomed from the outset, due to pressures from all their friends and families, and society itself. Everyone except Sonny.It took me a few months to fully appreciate this movie. Everything about it is so *honest*. It is at times, happy, sad, funny, crazy, romantic, terrifying and nostalgic. I won't reveal the dramatic ending, but I will spill one bean. The author of this semi-autobiographical story is also named Calagero, but he's better known as 'Chazz' Palmintieri, who is also the star. It rates as one of the better movies I've ever seen.

In fact, I didn't watch this final film featuring the original crew from start to finish until just last night. Without a doubt, this movie is more impressive than The Final Frontier, the second last movie of the bunch, one which is widely considered by fans to be a disappointment.The Klingons have been enemies of the Federation for a very long time, but after their moon explodes, their planet's ozone layer will be depleted in approximately fifty years, which will mean their death! In an attempt to save themselves from this fate, the Klingons plan to have peace talks with the Federation. However, Kirk is not pleased when he hears about this, as he does not trust the Klingons, especially after they killed his son years ago! Nonetheless, the crew are to escort the Klingon ship, Kronos One, to Earth. However, on their way, Kronos One is attacked! It appears this attack has come from the Enterprise, even though Kirk knows nothing about it! When Kirk and McCoy board the Klingon ship, they are soon arrested, convicted, and sentenced to spend the rest of their natural lives in captivity on Rura Penthe, a frozen planetoid!This final film of the six featuring the crew from the original Star Trek TV series is sometimes slow, and I certainly didn't love every minute of it, but I can't say I've loved every minute of any of its five predecessors, so this was no surprise. Fortunately, like three out of five of the previous movies (The Wrath of Khan, The Search for Spock, and The Voyage Home), it still left me satisfied. There is a reasonable amount of excitement, as one would hope for, as well as impressive effects. There is also a bit of humour, obviously not as much as there is in The Voyage Home, but the film does have its occasional funny moments, including the part where Cmdr. Uhura attempts to communicate with Klingons in their language, but the sub-titles indicate that she's not doing so well.Unlike The Final Frontier, it appears William Shatner had no involvement in the writing and directing in The Undiscovered Country, which was probably for the better, judging by the quality of the fifth film. Leonard Nimoy was involved in the writing for this final installment, which he seems to be good at, and the film was directed by Nicholas Meyer, who also directed the highly acclaimed second ST movie, The Wrath of Khan. Yes, it would have been sad had The Final Frontier been the last film of bunch, but fortunately, at least one good film featuring Kirk and his crew followed, and concluded the franchise well.

That's what makes Blue Velvet so shocking, so intriguing, so nightmarish and so masterful. Only David Lynch could master another film as extraordinary; its easy to see why Blue Velvet caused such a sensation in 1986, and is managing to do so again today. The reason it caused a seismic scandal is because we live in a world of plummeting standards, mindless violence, and gratuitous sex, it's refreshing---and entirely rare---when you come across a major motion picture that the whole family can enjoy. If you're looking for that kind of film, Blue Velvet is more than the mother lode.It's a slice of small-town life, were everything seems simple, were everyone bakes Apple Pies, watches murder mysteries on television, and likes to keep they're gardens trim and tidy. Its the kind of town were the last murder probably occurred a hundred years ago. Or so you'd expect. Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan, David Lynch's muse), who resides in this town, lives with his parents and elderly Aunt Barbara (veteran actress Frances Bay). With his father hospitalized after a massive heart attack, Beaumont stumbles across a mystery at the heart of sleepy little Lumberton. Beaumont teams up with high school sweatheart Sandy Williams (Laura Dern, Wild at Heart, Jurassic Park) and Sandy's father---a Lumberton detective---to delve into the mystery that has their little town on edge, and ultimately to snap the cuffs on a gang of dastardly baddies (headed up by Dennis Hopper in a stellar role as the villainous Frank Booth).Isabella Rossellini (former face of Lancome cosmetics) serves up a particularly memorable role as singer who seems to be on the verge of a mental breakdown, or is in the process of one, Dorothy Vallens, menaced by Booth and his rowdies, who manages to keep up a fighting spirit and lift everyone's spirits with cheerful, all-American musical standards. Grandpa and AMC-fans will particularly get a kick out the film's 1950's musical score, including golden oldies like Roy Orbison's In Dreams and Bobby Vinton's yesteryear hit Blue Velvet.Blue Velvet also exhibits some flawless cinematography, by Frederick Elmes (who did the camera-work for 2003's Hulk) shows off the green gables, rose gardens, red curtains, blue velvet gowns, and white picket fences of an all-American town to pristine perfection. I don't think any director has realized the zany human cosmology of a small American town since Sam Wood's 1949 version of Our Town.While Blue Velvet heads over to the seamier side of town to plumb the more mysterious goings-on, don't fret---Lynch keeps rein over the more frightening elements of this salute to the Heartland. Like any Hardy Boys outing, things may get a little tense, but there's nothing too rough for the tots here, and good wins out in the end. Lynch proves you can put together an all-American classic and STILL manage to have a happy ending, like the latest Disney film, or Wizard of Oz.I don't think anyone could remake a film like this today, and if they'd attempt to do so, I'd laugh right in their faces.
