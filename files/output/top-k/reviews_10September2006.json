I then became hooked on Farscape, in its 3rd or 4th season at the time, and found Pitch Black on cable one night around bed time - so I said oh why not, at least it has Claudia Black in it. Soon, I recognized Keith David, and began to realize that Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser could all act (why this should surprise me, I do not know). I was captivated. I have now remained captivated for four years. I just watched the film for the 3rd or 4th time, and I still love it.This is not an art film, not an independent, and its not entirely original, but where it fails to break a lot of new ground, it utterly succeeds in providing interesting, realistic characters, hard-driving action in the medium of a compelling but simple plot, and non-stop entertainment; an absolutely beautiful environment with tastefully rendered special effects. Sound to good to be true? Don't take my word for it... see it for yourself.The film also highlighted the charisma of the now somewhat iconoclastic Vin Diesel, introducing the character of Richard Riddick. Diesel would go on to star in the somewhat Riddick-ulous Chronicles thereof (which I also enjoyed, though recognizing its rather huge flaws) and is now something of a legend. Diesel is so charismatic, so big, and so interesting to watch that it is easy to ignore the fact that he is not only a talented actor, but a smart one too. Checking out the DVD version of Pitch Black, with the audio comments on might just blow you away.The film is about the crew of an inter-system transport ship stranded on an unknown planet after a crash-landing in which their captain was killed. The new commander is inexperienced but bright and heroic (Mitchell), but she is caught between two dominant and dangerous personalities - a bounty hunter with secrets (Hauser) and a dangerous criminal who has been surgically altered to see in the dark (Diesel). Is that all? Of course not - the planet is inhabited, and the inhabitants are hungry.As unoriginal and improbable as some of this may be, Pitch Black is beautifully filmed, well told, and very nicely performed. Don't expect to learn anything, and don't expect to have to think a whole lot, but do expect to have fun with this modern sci-fi action classic.

Oldman is suitably snarky as the Count, more dirty-old-man than fiend here, while Rider and Hopkins chew the scenery in most of the right places. But the gem of the bunch, and the actor who really sells me on this version as an accurate adaptation of Stoker's work, is Keanu Reeves.Keanu Reeves, like Jack Nicholson, is strictly a one-trick-pony, acting-wise. For Nicholson, it's the gigglingly violent manic-depressive. He's got the crazy-thang down pat, but whenever he plays any other kind of role he falls right on his butt. For Keanu Reeves, think back to his star-maker, Bill n' Ted's Excellent Adventure. What Keanu Reeves, in all his blow-dried glory, pulls off well is pure California Stoner.Cast him as an action star in The Matrix and you've got crapola, cast him as a Shakespearian villain in Much Ado About Nothing, and it's laughable. But cast him as an everyman who is caught up in Things He Cannot Control, and he pulls it off neatly. Think of his signature line whoah. It's the mating cry of the laid-back schmuck, run up against something WAY too heavy for him to handle. It's why the only parts of The Matrix that work, acting-wise, are those in which Keanu is dorking around, bumbling from one chaotic nightmare to another, totally over his head. The second he tries to pull off the uber-cool hero schtick, he blows it.Luckily, in Coppola's Dracula, all Reeves has to do is play his best role. Johnathan Harker is Stoker's everyman, a typical English twit, prissy, correct, and utterly devoid of imagination. The whole reason the Count can get away with his invasion of Englan is because Johnathan is too dull to conceive of really cosmic evil. Dracula gives the guy about 400 clues as to his demonic nature, and they just wash over Harker like oil over a goose. Reeves plays that up in the flick...blue flames, giant wolves, people crawling backwards down the walls, and he just goes whoah, then gets on with arranging paperwork.
