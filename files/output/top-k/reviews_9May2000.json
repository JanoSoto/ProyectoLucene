Jane wasn't to great, and White Squall was lacking at the end) I'm glad to say Ridley Scott is back in his game.  I was looking forward to this film for awhile, it looked to be an impressive piece of cinema and plus, it had Russel Crowe in it.  After a few months of waiting for it to come to theaters, I was it opening day with a sold out crowd.  Everyone in the theater seemed to have really enjoyed it.  Some thought it was to long (drags a lil at the beginning), some thought it was to violent (guess they haven't seen Braveheart), but most of us thought it was excellent.I'm not gonna give anything away in this review like many have already done. I must say Ridley Scott hasn't had beautiful shots like this since Legend. The cinemtography really pulls you into the story - Rome has never looked this stunning.  The acting was oustanding on all counts, everyone was very well casted.  Above all, what hit me most about this movie wasn't the cinematography, nor the directing, nor the storyline.  It was Russel Crowe. This guy proves himself that he is the Marlon Brando of the new generation. He's wonderful as Maximus, some of the weakest lines in the film he makes them sound amazing.  I can only hope him and Edward Nortan, another actor who's amazing, will make a movie sometime together.As for my dislikes of the movie - the editing.  It's nice to see that a lot of people agree about how similar this is to Braveheart.  Mel Gibson and Ridley Scott are very different directors and Scott approached this as an in your face kind of thing.  For many scenes it dosen't bother you, but the opening battle and the first gladiator battle are very hard to follow because of this.  I wish some of the action scenes lasted longer than they did, although the battles in Rome are oustanding.  I wish I could have been able to tell what was going on a lot easier in the opening battle (the start of it as thousands of arrows fly through the air is magnificent) since everything happens very fast.Overall though I expect this to be one of the biggest hits of the summer. Maybe not in profit, but it has already made it on the top 250 so it seems most people love it.  This movie will make Russel Crowe standout soon enough as another 20 million dollar actor, and he deserves it more than anyone.

I enjoyed the minor details a whole lot the dresses in the Roman empire had more to do with how people actually dressed in the Middle Ages, than the greco-roman toga and sandal vision that Hollywood created. Also, notice how the nobility wears blue colors it was the most expensive color for fabrics, since very few things in nature have that pigmentation.I enjoyed seeing the palaces with actual furniture, (unlike in classic Hollywood), and the nobility using glasses and glass utensils. Romans were incredibly skillful at glassworks. Unfortunately, only a few pieces have lasted until today. It was also quite impressive how the movie starts by showing you why the Roman Empire was so powerful and lasted so long their technology and war machinery was ages ahead of the rest of the known world. Most of Europe was still living in tribal societies. As we can see in the opening scenes, the tribes of Germania barely entered the bronze age when they got beaten by Roman war machinery. And of course, I appreciated that the main character, Maximus, is not from the Laetium (Rome), but from Spain, one of the provinces of the Roman Empire since about 100BC. Spain, Portugal and Southern France (Hispania, Lusitania, and Galia) were the second most important provinces of Rome.Spain was kind-of like their Cambridge, Mass they sent their future Caesars, senators and Emperors to the many Roman universities in Spain (Salamanca, Complutum, Caceres) and military academies. Even Julius Caesar, for instance, was educated in Spain. With its minor flaws, Gladiator was definitely a great show, highly entertaining as well as educative.

As a matter of fact, it borrows a lot from Macbeth, King Lear, and The Odyssey. And some of the dialogue was trite... On the other hand, it's probably the most realistic depiction of the middle Roman Empire in film to date. The use of CGI was outstanding, specially the reconstruction of the Colisseum. I enjoyed the minor details a whole lot the dresses in the Roman empire had more to do with how people actually dressed in the Middle Ages, than the greco-roman toga and sandal vision that Hollywood created. Also, notice how the nobility wears blue colors it was the most expensive color for fabrics, since very few things in nature have that pigmentation.I enjoyed seeing the palaces with actual furniture, (unlike in classic Hollywood), and the nobility using glasses and glass utensils.

However, upon actually viewing the film, I found that there is much more at work here. Of course, Scott is no Joel Schumacher and Russell Crowe isn't a Schwarzeneggar type, so this came with only a minimal amount of surprise. To address my initial hopes, Gladiator does harbor a variety of extraordinary images. The Roman cityscape is worth the price of admission in itself. Although some shots exhibit that too bright look that a lot of cgi effects have, the majority of scenes are composed with convincing authenticity. But forget the settings. Let's talk about satisfying the I want to see brutal murder and dismemberment desires of most moviegoers. Don't get too excited. As far as the blood and guts go, it seems that all of the battle sequences were cut in extremely short takes thrown together with shaky-cam perspective(I'm guessing they were trying to avoid an NC-17 rating). The bottom line is in most shots, you really can't tell what is happening except for traces of red derived from spraying blood and the occasional death scream. I understand some things are in bad taste, but when you are depicting the gladiator sport, the exploitation of death is the center of entertainment. Points off for that one. Also in poor form is the editing of the film in general. Gladiator is either an edge-of-your-seat roller coaster ride or a soap-opera paced drama and never falls anywhere between these two extremes. There is simply no transition. So what you seem to be left with is two films a Mad-Max-style, kill 'em all hand to hand combat action flick on one hand and an expensive period piece character-study on the other. It's not that the performances are bad. It's just that there is essentially very little plot, so the actors have no means of developing their characters other than in face-to-face emotional monologues. Which brings me to the overly-dramatic-at-points score. There is a scene in the beginning of the film where Commodus and his father discuss the future of Rome. It entails Commodus communicating great frustration to his father through an emotional out-pour. The scene is acted adequately, but the music is laughably out of place and you feel like laughing at Commodus rather than understanding his plight. Aside from that, and a rather weak ending, Gladiator is, by all means, a must see. It runs over older sword and sandal epics with a 4-horse chariot (ok, that was pretty lame...forgive me).

Most movies that tell the life of Jesus choose to tell it from the impartial viewer perspective--from the invisible I-know-what-all-the-characters-are-thinking-and-feeling standpoint (Jesus of Nazereth for instance.  Great actors, great story--just didn't have that THING, the thing that makes you go, Wow, that was a GREAT movie.).  Telling it from Judah's perspective made it seem so real and personal, just like Christ works in people's lives.  HE had no clue what everyone else was thinking, and frankly didn't care (because of his drive of hate and aggression towards Messala).  The music suited the film--it wasn't fake or any of that false-epic-durge kind of stuff. Charlton Heston was perfect for the role because of his ability to convey intense emotions without being melodramatic or put-on (which is what being a great actor is all about).  Seeing Jesus' actions instead of concentrating on his face or physical appearance was genius; it showed the more important aspect of His life--His teachings and purpose--while giving Him the supernatural presence required, since no one can really describe Jesus completely.  The scene with Judah crying for help and Jesus giving him water...a true tearjerker for me!  Also symbolic of how (according to Christian theology) Jesus gives living water, and when you drink of Him you shall never thirst again.   And it is SO TOUGH when the Roman guard barks, I told you NONE FOR HIM! and Jesus just stands up.  Doesn't move. Doesn't flinch.  Doesn't say a word.  Just stands up and looks at him.  Ha haaaa!  That look on the guard's face--humbled and put in his place.  I just wanted to chide at him, You just can't whip Jesus.  Just can't.  Esther does a great job of being Judah's former self--the Judah before the clash with Messala.  Esther was a great witness as well, telling Judah Christ's teachings without self-righteousness or oppression--just wanting to share the truth of the message.  All in all, I'd say the best movie of this century (sorry Titanic fans) and a masterpiece that's real and human, while focusing on the purpose of life.

But AFTER they chose a decent story, I don't think anything went right.  The biggest problems - perhaps they are only the most obvious problems - are miscasting, and under-rendering.What made anyone think that Robin Williams should play a robot - in particular, this robot?  It's not that he's bad, it's just that he's so clearly swimming upstream, it makes me wince.  Hugh Grant, Kevin Spacey, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jim Carey ... it's hard to think of ANY other well-known actor who wouldn't have been more appropriate.  They're all so OBVIOUSLY more appropriate one wonders why they weren't asked.  (That is, given that Columbus was casting his net so wide that Robin Williams was a serious candidate in the first place.)  To take a case no-one can quarrel with, Brent Spiner (Data from `Star Trek') does what Robin Williams is trying to do, or ought to have been trying to do, a hundred times better.By `under-rendering' I mean many things.  This is a story that begins AFTER a quiet revolution in the future (robots have become household appliances, at least for the very wealthy) and stretches two hundred years FURTHER into the future.  What does this future look like?  Inasmuch as it looks like anything at all, it looks like the world of today.  But the key clause in that sentences is, `inasmuch as it looks like anything at all'.  Asimov's story makes more positive assertions about what the future is like, than the film, and Columbus had a duty to add detail, at least visual detail, to the story, and sketch a future that felt as if it were more than a cardboard backdrop.  (In retrospect `The Fifth Element' looks as if it had something going for it after all - it at least went to THAT much effort.)  -Oh, every so often we see someone wearing a silly dress, or we see people playing chess with ridiculous non-Staunton pieces that's as far as it goes.  In general the Columbus strategy is to remove details that could pin the setting down to the late twentieth century, not add details that would suggest some other setting.  (The opposite approach can be seen in `A Clockwork Orange'.  Kubrick makes no effort to remove trappings of the 1970s; instead he adds to them.  I know which approach I prefer.  One at least REMEMBERS `A Clockwork Orange'.)But the under-rendering is obvious even if we ignore the setting.  Conversations, the details of personal relationships, the nature of the law these, too, are painted in the most under-nourished and non-committal way.  It's this, I fancy, that made so many people feel that nothing happens.  The story just trundles along, each scene resembling the last (`inasmuch as it resembles anything'), no scene ever igniting or standing out.A minor point I'd like to mention while I'm on the topic the music.  Notice that every piece of music we hear dates to - surprise, surprise - the twentieth century - with two interesting exceptions.  The first is a gorgeous aria (the famous one from `Rusalka') by Antonin Dvorak, which Andrew is entranced by shortly after he is plugged in.  The second is a bit of 21st-century piano music (I presume that's what it is), represented by an original composition by James Horner.  It's a wonder Andrew could bear to listen to it after Dvorak.  The scene in which he and Little Miss play the banal, anaemic melody in octaves is enough to make anyone block his ears and try to imagine something else.  I doubt I have ever heard a weaker tune.  But no somehow, he and Little Miss manage play this wretched four-handed drivel, on and off, for fifteen years.  Fifteen years!  It defies belief that human (or non-human) taste could be so degraded.  (One of Horner's lifeless tunes becomes a song which we hear over the closing credits it's guaranteed to empty a cinema in no time.)You'll gather that there are, indeed, MANY things wrong with this film.  The conclusion is telegraphed too early and too clumsily.  The scene with the two hoodlums - it's in Asimov's story - has been removed; a love story that weakens the whole in too many ways to document, has been added.  (Perhaps this love story appeared when the story was inflated into a novel.  If so, so much the worse for the novel.)

Nothing less could be said of him. The screen play was amazing! It looked deep into the life of a multi-millionaire newspaper owner, Charles Foster Kane, after his death. The goal for a newsreel reporter was to find the meaning of Kane's dying words, Rosebud. In his search he discovers many opinions of Mr. Kane and the life that he led. He finds that Kane was never satisfied and always wanted more. It was an attempt to gain the life he knew as a child. Citizen Kane is considered by many to be the greatest film ever made, and I must agree completely. The technical work that went into the film was ground-breaking. At one point in production, Wells couldn't get a low enough angle for the shot he wanted so he cut out the floor of the studio a 430 in the morning. Wells had to have everything perfect for this picture. He certainly did. Citizen Kane IS the greatest movie ever made.

Russell Crowe is just brilliant and puts in another oscar winning performance. This man can't put a foot wrong at the moment following his huge success in The Insider, although it took me a while to realise it was him as i am sure it will you. A good comeback also by Ridley Scott, who directed it well after a disappointing and not such a great effort with G I Jane. I just couldn't get enough of this film. It wasn't too long or too short, but i can see why the female of the species may not take a liking to it, as there was vast amounts of violence and blood which for me made it better, along with a terrific story line and a heart warming end. I recommend you seeing it but can't guarentee you'll like it as much as i did.
