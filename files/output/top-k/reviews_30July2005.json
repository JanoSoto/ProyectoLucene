His character in Sleepy Hollow is certainly nothing like any role he's taken before. The special effects are excellent they all look very realistic.

This is how action movies should be made. All producers of schlock ranging from Armageddon to National Treasure need to take a good, hard look at this film and learn something from it.The storyline from Speed is incredibly simple madman threatens to blow things up if ransom isn't paid; law enforcement hero & co-workers try to stop him; innocent people in the mix throw in a wild card. The storyline is very simple and very linear and has virtually no complexity. And that is exactly what films like this require. They are action films, don't try to get all fancy with complicated plot lines. The audience wants to see stuff blow up, just get to it.The plot line is also believable. Sure, some of Speed's setups are pretty complicated (the elevator trick seems like an awful lot of work for a simple ransom gig). But overall it's written with great plausibility. The story has to be simple, but it also has to be believable, otherwise the audience is too busy laughing at the ludicrousness of it all to really get into the excitement of the film.The writing has to be crisp and to the point. There's not a lot of chatter in this film. This is an action movie, so dialogue is supposed to be short and sweet. No long discussions in a command center about what to do next, just think on your feet, bark orders out, make those snap decisions, and save all the small talk until later. Nothing ruins the pacing of an action film like laborious strategy discussions.The stunts have to be believable. Fans don't mind spectacular stunts, heck that's why we go to these movies! But the stunts can't be completely outrageous. Yes, the bus jump in Speed is outrageous, but the rest of the stuff is entirely plausible, and you can forgive one off-the-wall stunt. But most of Arnold's or Steven Segal's crap is so full of impossible stunts and crashes, they play like multi-million dollar episodes of CHiPS, where every highway crash involves cars doing cartwheels in the air...The actors have to be genuine. The best part of Keanu & Sandra's performances in Speed is they really play it with a high degree of believability. Keanu looks and acts like a hard-driven cop, too serious for his own good. Contrast that with his completely unbelievable performance as an undercover FBI agent in Point Break (a truly horrible movie). And Sandra plays it straight as a wise-ass woman who lost her license. She's not just a screaming bimbo but she also has a heart (as seen in the baby carriage scene). And the best part of these two stars? This film is not created as a star vehicle just for them, something you can't say of Nicholas Cage or Van Damme flicks.The action carries through the whole film. Some films (Bond films like to do this) have action then dialogue then action then love scenes then action then something else. If you're going to make an action flick then devise a way to have action through the whole thing. This film does just that, and without making it boring, either. Just when you think it can't get any worse for Our Heroes it does indeed, and that's good film-making.Other elements in this film are top-notch as well. The music is the perfect accompaniment to the story. The cinematography is not at all claustrophobic even though most of the action takes place on a bus. The special effects are seamless with the live action. The supporting cast is quite good as well (with the exception of Alan Ruck as the neurotic tourist, but that's really a bad part, not Alan's fault).All in all Speed is an example of how to make a contemporary action film.10 out of 10.Barky ","genre":null},{"date":"30 July 2005","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Speed is an excellent action movie.

Don't get me wrong, I loved Batman Begins, but it doesn't top Tim Burton's film from 1989. Burton makes an interesting decision by combining the original Bob Kane\/Bill Finger comics from 1939 and the early '40s, Frank Miller's work on Batman from the '80s, and his own take on the character.The film's plot is about Batman battling his first major villain, the Joker. In the beginning of the film we can see that Gotham City is in dept, the police force is corrupted, and the mafia controls everything. A friendly\/naive family cannot roam the streets without being mugged or approached by hookers. It isn't a pretty place. The Joker is actually Jack Napier. Napier was mob boss Carl Grissom's (Jack Palance) right hand man before falling into a vat of chemicals and turning into the psychotic Joker.While the film does have its flaws you really can't hold it against it because Batman Begins has flaws of its own. Yes, the relationship between Batman and Commissioner Gordon isn't explored in this film. But, if you recall in Batman Begins the character of Scarecrow doesn't really do anything special. He is almost a waste! So, both films aren't perfect.Additionally, the film benefits a lot from its moments. I really love the scene in which Batman crashes through the window and rescues Vicky Vale. And, how about when he takes her to the bat cave? There are other great moments in this film that I really love, but I don't have time to get into. It is what you would call a very memorable film. There's a lot of images and moments that stay with you. I don't know if I can say the same about Begins.RATING 4 (****) out of (****) The sets in this film created by the late Anton Furst are amazing. The musical score by Danny Elfman is amazing as well.

One side of me loves what the characters are saying and the story while the other side of me dislikes everything else. It is shot on grainy black and white film, the sound quality is poor, the acting is hit and miss, there are continuity errors galore, and the humor is so gutter that it gives the gutter a bad name.I like Clerks. because the world the film portrays, what the characters say, and the nuggets in the murkiness, allows me to overlook the hey kids lets get out the camcorder and make a movie feel to the movie.You want to hate this film with all the being in your body but it wears on you like an old friend at a bar.I first saw the film when it first came out on VHS. I rented it and while it had its funny moments it just didn't thrill me after all the hype I had read or heard about it then. It wasn't the worst movie I'd seen but it wasn't the best either. It did lead me to see the other films Kevin Smith made in later years and those I did like very much.I had a chance to revisit Clerks. and it may have been maturity on my part but I could appreciate the art and passion put into the film. You don't have to work in the service industry to understand the film or the story. Anyone with a job knows a Dante or a Randal. People know about the crew at the Quick Stop who are rude and pretentious for no other reason than they can be. After all they are working at a convenience store, if they really had the answer to life, they wouldn't be working in a convenience store - right? The thing is they don't want to be there but they can't think of doing anything else.There are thousands of us who hate our jobs but we go to them any way because we won't take the chance on any thing else. Our sucky job is comfortable - like an old shoe. We know there is better out in the world but we know what we are doing at our jobs now - why take the chance?

After learning that it might take a while before he can get his prisoner he decides to take it in own hands to bring him back, but while doing so he is jumped at the airport and the prisoner escapes. So now it's personal and he uses his western methods to recapture his man, but the city cops don't share his ways.Before they teamed up for the classic cop film Dirty Harry (1971) - Don Siegel directed Clint Eastwood in an earlier and under-appreciated cop drama Coogen's Bluff. I came across this film only knowing that it starred Eastwood and that's about it. But to my surprise it had more to it than Eastwood's strong persona, but it was engaging and clever entertainment by director Don Siegel. What it generates is a violent and hard-hitting police story that has superb attention to detail and is particularly well crafted. There's so many things going for it that you may or may not notice all the small hints that the film possesses on the clash of two different cultures (city vs. western) and the protagonist being dragged into the wicked and dirty side of the hippie drug circuit. This is when he learns that he is out of his league and that he has to adapt to this city way off life to get his man, sometimes with dire consequences because he grows slowly attached to it. Add in some psychedelic overtones and a spaced out feel to evoke the carefree era. The whole setup is naturally staged and doesn't feel forced. Siegel seems to have a knack of creating a gritty mood, but also capturing the life of the unique surroundings, from the Arizona deserts (excellent opening sequence) to the harsh city life. This was helped by fluid camera-work with its high shots and smooth pans that are well staged. The location photography and dashing settings are two of the strong points of this production. Another is the rousing score that mixes some western tang into the equation. Throw in edgy and sharp dialogue, with also scathing humour and an abundance of Texas gags against our protagonist. Siegel's paces the film perfectly and generates tension in some well-designed action scenes, one being the bike chase scene through the park. Though, this film isn't overtly filled with just action and violence. It's an amusing watch with a set-up that has more to it! Eastwood gives an iconic cool-as-ice performance as the Texas, ah I mean Arizona deputy sheriff who adapts his hunting techniques for the big city and who's quick with a sharp reply. Lee J. Cobb is good as the arrogant Det. Lt. McElroy, NYPD who has no time for Coogan or his antics. Susan Clark plays Julie Roth a probation officer and possibly Coogan's love interest. A superb Don Stroud weaselly plays James Ringerman the criminal who Coogan's after and Tisha Sterling plays Ringerman's hippie girlfriend. There's also a small role by a feisty Betty Field as Mrs. Ellen Ringerman.Actually, it's hard to find one thing that I didn't actually like about the film. Highly recommended!

It's nowhere near as good as the 1933 version,but who would really expect it to be. That remains the greatest of giant monster movies and a milestone in film-making. However,taken on it's own,this one is not bad at all.Rather than replicate the original,the filmmakers take a different approach. Some things work,some things don't,but kudos for trying. The updating of the characters for 70s sensibilities now seems as dated as the ones in the original movie,and Jessica Lange's heroine just comes across as an empty headed bimbo. The environmentalist message is still pertinent though,and the filmmakers stop short of labouring their issues.Kong himself is a lot less fearsome,in fact the man-in-suit creature seems rather cuddly. Scenes when he attacks people almost seem out of place and compare badly with similar sequences in the original. Look out for the brief appearance of the robot Kong prop during the scene when he breaks out of his cage,it looks nothing like the Kong of the rest of the film. Special effects are generally good though. They are generally a lot less ambitious-no dinosaurs for one thing,except for one out-of-place giant snake-but they are usually quite good.The film is a little sluggish,and seems to display little imagination at times-consider how dull the island looks in this version. However,the filmmakers were attempting a somewhat more realistic film. They also succeed in creating quite a a bit more pathos,especially at the end.

The first time I saw this, I caught a few minutes of it on HBO. I had to do something, so I only got to see a few minutes, but in those few minutes I was laughing more times per second than I had ever laughed before. Through that one time when I only saw a few minutes, I knew I had to see this from the beginning.This is a spoof of films that take place in the ghetto. The films it spoofs include Boyz N the Hood, Menace II Society, Juice, South Central, Higher Learning, Poetic Justice, and other films. Part of the reason I laughed so hard is because I had seen most of those movies, and I knew them well enough. If you haven't seen any of those movies, you probably won't find this to be funny. If you want to see any of those movies in order to understand this, the main ones you will have to see are Boyz N the Hood and Menace II Society. I laughed so hard when I saw this. It seems as though every second something funny happens. The movie follows Ashtray, a young man who is sent to live with his father in order to learn better and have more of a chance to succeed in life(think of Boyz N the Hood). Strangely, his Father is younger than he is. Little things like that make this movie very funny. Some other funny characters are Ashtray's cousin Loc Dog, Loc Dog's trigger happy Grandmother, their crippled friend Crazy Legs, and a desperate drug addict with some of the funniest lines in the movie. Funny things happen with these characters, such as when we first see Loc Dog's Grandma, she is swearing just about every word. A couple of minutes later, she smokes a huge joint, which is also hilarious. The look on her face, and her mannerisms in that scene are priceless. Another funny scene with Grandma is when she and another elderly woman are having a break dance competition in church. The character Crazy Legs was formerly the best dancer in the hood, until he was paralyzed from the waste down in a drive by. He has these little stubby legs that are about half the size of normal legs. In one scene he has a dream that he is a dancer in the video for MC Hammer's Can't Touch This. That scene is so funny, it had me laughing for quite a while. This movie is not for everyone. Anyone who is offended by racial stereotypes will probably not enjoy this movie, as there are a lot of racial stereotypes in many scenes. Another reason this isn't for everyone is because not everyone is into this type of humor, and not everyone has watched the movies that this is a spoof of. If you are into this type of humor, and you have seen the movies that this is based on, then I'm sure you'll love it. If you like movies like this, then it is a must see. If you aren't into this type of movie, then you will probably spend better time watching another movie.

In 1999, director Michael Mann retold this story in grade A fashion.The Insider deals with the CBS 60 Minutes special involving the tobacco company Brown & Williams and their former researcher Dr. Jeff Wigand (Russell Crowe). 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) will go to great lengths to get this man to talk about his work with the company. What he has to get around is the confidentiality agreement that Wigand signed. Now that he has been fired for a bogus reason, he wants to get back at the company that now threatens his family. Bergman tries to bend the rules and go around every corner to get this man to testify in a court of law so that his testament will not be liable with the confidentiality agreement.With B&W watching every move that Wigand makes and checking everything that has happened to him from birth up to this point in time, Wigand is ready to do anything. Before he even appearers in court, he records an interview with 60 Minutes host Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer). This interview may not go on the air at all if certain things aren't made right. What Bergman must do now is protect Wigand and still air this special without causing any trouble because he knows that this will be the biggest case in US history.Crowe and Pacino both give breathtaking performances. Crowe was nominated for his portrayal of Wigand and was well deserved. Wigand is an interesting character. He has to make the right choices without hurting his reputation, his family, and without breaking the deal with his former company. The decisions he makes are both life changing and have an impact on those around him. Pacino as Bergman is the perfect fit. He is an explosive actor and very passionate with his work. His work in this movie is incredible. He combines a soft heart with a hard-nose attitude that gives him a very powerful presence. These two men are great and even Plummer as Wallace gives a great performance. His character is both working for the people so they are informed, and working for CBS, making sure they don't go under with this story. All together, there is a great cast with smaller parts even shinning, especially Bruce McGill as Ron Motley, one of the lawyers working with Wigand.The Insider is a must see.

Their fates are almost too kind in comparison to what happens to them in the book. Even the fate of Villefort, which is decent in the movie, is like a blessing compared to the madness he goes through in Dumas's book.

The book also did a splendid job in further developing the villains, showing the flaws of their characters, while the movie COMPLETELY misses this crucial part. The Count of Monte Cristo's richness and extravagance are merely bad taste in the movie (yes, this includes the damn balloon...). The book gave exceptional details about the efforts the Count puts into building his extravagant image, the movie only shows a party with some extremely bad dialogs. Not a good trade in my opinion. Faria is also poorly represented, from the great mentor and wise man he was in the book he becomes just a tutor for Edmond in the movie; his death is lame and the escape is very rushed and hollywood-like. The point of all this is that all the character exposition and development that went on in the book is completely gone in the movie.There are also many, many things that were left out of the movie, some (important) characters, some good plot points. Some characters were simply killed (Villefort's father for example) to greatly simplify the plot. I understand this, since the writer had to cram 3 volumes into a two hour movie, but this is almost like badly done video compression small size, but very poor quality.All in all, if you haven't read the book go watch the movie, you'll probably enjoy it to some extent, but any fan of the original masterpiece should steer clear of this, for it is indeed painful to watch.
