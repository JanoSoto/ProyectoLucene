[{"date":"13 March 2003","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Shrek is a great tale that follows an ogre named Shrek and a donkey, that won't shut up, named Donkey and their adventure to save a Princess in a castle guarded by a fire-breathing dragon. When they find the castle the fire-breathing dragon turns out to be a female and falls in love with Donkey. They rescue the Princess and then they head to a village called Duloc to deliver the Princess to Lord Farquaad. He is the one that sends Shrek on this journey to rescue the Princess, so he can marry her to become a King. Shrek interrupts the wedding of Lord Farquaad and Princess Fiona because he loves the Princess. Princess Fiona awaits a kiss from Shrek so a curse that was put on her by a witch would be lifted from her. The curse turns her in to an ogre every time the sunsets and the only way to lift the curse is to have true loves first kiss. But she stays an ogre to show children that true beauty comes from within. Shrek and Princess Fiona get married. Lord Farquaad is eating by the fire-breathing dragon, and she falls in love with Donkey, and vise versa. Everything is great in the end. The animation for Shrek is fantastic. No other animated film that I have viewed is as good or better. Ice Age, Toy Story 1&2, and Monster's Inc. are very fine animated films, but not Shrek quality. The film is also funny for kids and adults. A lot of little comments in Shrek that is meant for adults, that little kids won't get. The animation along with the story is why I give Shrek * * * ½ out of 4 stars & a 8\/10.
