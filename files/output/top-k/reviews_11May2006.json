I know it is hard to think of a musical horror movie without thinking about The Rocky Horror Picture Show, but De Palma strikes first with this more horror-oriented (although still hysterically funny) satire on the music industry of the 70s.Swan (Paul Williams) is a powerful and legendary music producer who is making preparations for his greatest triumph in music business The Paradise, a monster auditorium that will serve him as palace. To inaugurate his palace, he is looking for the perfect sound and he fins it in the music of Winslow Leach (William Finley), a young composer who dreams with presenting his Faust cantata to the world. Swan steals Leach's work and in an accident, deforms his face turning Leach into The Phantom. Now, as the masked monster, the Phantom will try to stop Swan's plans by sabotaging the Paradise.The movie is a visually and musically impressive rock opera with a healthy dose of horror and tongue-in-cheek humor. Brian De Palma cleverly conjures the basic outline of Leroux's novel and add elements of his other influences making the movie a subtle yet moving tribute to the books\/movies\/music he loves. The modernization and the change from opera to rock work surprisingly good and despite of being a bit outdated by now, the music (by Paul Williams) still makes one of the best soundtracks in a horror film.De Palma continues improving his technique in this film and like in the previous Sisters, his style shows maturity and a definitive trademark. Often labeled as a Hitchcock-imitator, I believe that De Palma simply likes to pay constant tribute to his influences, and this film serves a proof of that. Elements of Welles, Hitchcock, Murneau, Whale and Wienne are all over the picture, yet Phantom of the Paradise is like none of the works of those directors.Paul Williams not only composed the soundtrack, he also stars as Swan, the dark and evil genius that leads Death Records and ultimately uses Leach's music for his own purposes. His performance is superb and while not physically imposing he is truly one of the best villains I've ever seen. Finley's take on the Phantom is, like most of the modern interpretations of the character, a romantic tragic figure; but Finley recovers some of the original horror characteristics of the novel creating an attractive but still menacing monster.Jessica Harper, who would achieve fame in Dario Argento's Suspiria, gives a good performance as Phoenix, the young singer that captures both Swan and Leach's attention. Like she would do in Suspiria, she adds depth to the role of the naive singer who wants nothing but to triumph. Something remarkable is the fact that she sang all her songs and did it with credibility and talent. Last but not least, Gerrit Graham portrays a Bowie-inspired Glam rock diva in the unforgettable role of rock superstar Beef.Sadly, not everything is perfect in Paradise, and neither is in this movie. The odd mixture of musical and horror works very good but at times the movie gets a bit too serious to pass as a musical or too silly to pass as a horror film. It's not a surprise that The Rocky Horror Picture Show gained more recognition as it keeps both genres perfectly in equilibrium in all its flamboyant runtime. Still, this is a minor flaw that keeps the movie away from perfection.Maybe I had low expectations or maybe I was just in the right mood, but Phantom of the Paradise was a pleasant surprise that I would not hesitate to recommend to fans of The Rocky Horror Picture Show or fans of black comedy in general. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"11 May 2006","score":"16 out of 19 people found the following review useful","review":" Phantom of the Paradise is Brian De Palma's outrageous blend of horror, comedy and rock opera very loosely based on Gaston Leroux's immortal novel Phantom of the Opera.

For those who have seen his recent comedy treats such as 50 First Dates and Anger Management, you'll have to watch Going Overboard to believe how lucky he is. Maybe directors felt sorry for him, I don't know. What I do know is his performance in this was pretty damn awful, even taking into account that this was his debut. Seriously, he looked as though was doing as part of an apprenticeship or something, also because he looked about 15 in this. There were parts in the film where I ALMOST felt for his character. It just feels as though his character didn't achieve anything real. He tried too hard to be funny but pretty much all of his jokes were desperately unfunny and cringefully lame. But another reason is because everyone else...well...you couldn't give a dead monkey about them to say the least. Their acting is awfully awful AWFUL. That's right Dickie Diamond, nobody gives a flying f*** about you either. He is a jerk who sticks his finger up at literally everything he resents. Miss Australia is annoying and weird because she hates Shecky yet she falls to Shecky's best friend despite only speaking to him for two seconds. She is a spoilt brat. And that general\/cat litter hermit who plays the film. Jesus...............................His character hardly looks like he's left that office in his entire life. Or possibly that desk even. Burt Young's acting in this is astonishingly crap. One scene that'll stick in my head for the rest of my life is the scene where he orders his inept terrorists to kill Miss Australia. Not the particularly the fact they set to kill her, but the reason why they do so. Those terrorists have some awful lines in this film. And from that killing scene, here is a *SPOILER* piece of the scriptNORIEGA She says I smell like like an old pizza TERRORIST 1(sniffs Noriega) Like an old, um...cheese pizza? TERRORIST 2 (Sniffs Noriega with really cheesy face) With anchovies? TERRORIST 1 What kind of crust? NORIEGA What does that matter? I want her killed. TERRORIST 2 A round circle-shaped pizza?Oh boy does it get worse Who is she? Star of the video-tapes?!. JEEEEEEEEEEEEZ. And then that song Noriega mumble-sings afterwards. It's a sad world when your head looks like a pizza. WTF?!!???!!!?! I'm surprised if anyone's looked that a pizza in the same way after watching that. If you have one while watching this, you'll very probably throw it the TV. Also the plot, apart from Shecky's story, is random and don't make sense. Like Miss Australia getting together with Shecky's pal as I mentioned above, and the terrorists becoming the ships star comedians. What the hell?! For crying out loud, the script writers obviously didn't realise that they aren't THOSE type of jokers. They're jokes are worse than Shecky's.All in all, even people who like this film have got to admit IT'S SO AWFUL THAT it's good. Well some parts anyhow are classic so bad-it's-good. Other parts are just painfully plain bad. You should only see this film if you like Adam Sandler and not feeling depressed. And even then you might want to kill something. Possibly yourself.

There is much to admire in this B movie, for quite honestly it's the best of director Corman's otherwise campy and badly written movies, which nevertheless enjoy cult classic fame. Jonathan Haze plays Seymour Krelborn, a shy, awkward young man who works at a flower shop owned by Mr. Gravis Mushnik (Mel Welles). He has a crush on the pretty but mysterious Audrey Fulquard. When business begins to wane, Seymour finds a rare plant which comes from nowhere and business begins to pick up. The plant is actually a predatory plant from outer space. It feeds on human blood. At first, Seymour makes the sacrifice and feeds the plant bits of his own blood. But the alien plant becomes endlessly hungry as it grows and begins to go on a rampage throughout Southern California. This odd movie is meant to be both very dark, disturbing and also tinged with elements of humor. Nevertheless, it is far darker than the musical, which can still be enjoyed by the whole family. This one is far uglier in its premise, ending tragically even. A wealth of bizarre characters appear- including a young Jack Nicholson, in what is apparently his first or second movie, as Mr. Wilbur Force, who derives pleasure, possibly sexual pleasure, from receiving intense pain from his dentist Dr. Farb (played by Jon Shaner) who in turn enjoys giving pain to his patients.

There is much to admire in this B movie, for quite honestly it's the best of director Corman's otherwise campy and badly written movies, which nevertheless enjoy cult classic fame. Jonathan Haze plays Seymour Krelborn, a shy, awkward young man who works at a flower shop owned by Mr. Gravis Mushnik (Mel Welles). He has a crush on the pretty but mysterious Audrey Fulquard. When business begins to wane, Seymour finds a rare plant which comes from nowhere and business begins to pick up. The plant is actually a predatory plant from outer space. It feeds on human blood. At first, Seymour makes the sacrifice and feeds the plant bits of his own blood. But the alien plant becomes endlessly hungry as it grows and begins to go on a rampage throughout Southern California. This odd movie is meant to be both very dark, disturbing and also tinged with elements of humor. Nevertheless, it is far darker than the musical, which can still be enjoyed by the whole family. This one is far uglier in its premise, ending tragically even. A wealth of bizarre characters appear- including a young Jack Nicholson, in what is apparently his first or second movie, as Mr. Wilbur Force, who derives pleasure, possibly sexual pleasure, from receiving intense pain from his dentist Dr. Farb (played by Jon Shaner) who in turn enjoys giving pain to his patients.

Tom Hanks has a special ability to make nothing seem like something. I often wonder if even HE knows what he's doing. You don't really notice it while he's doing it, but after the film find yourself feeling like you know the guy. Unlike being shocked by the sheer magnetism of a Marlin Brando, or the energy of Robert DeNiro, Hanks wins you over by appearing NOT to act. It's like you're watching a video of yourself going through what he is doing. Like you have lived it. Another special treat is gentle giant Michael Clarke Duncan playing the healer John Coffey. Such tenderness and control while holding back a flood of emotion, all without slipping into bathos is a rare thing indeed. Duncan should have won an academy award. A mesmerizing performance. Michael Jeter also turns in a fine performance as the Cajun convict Eduard Delacroix. Bonnie Hunt was doing such a good job I didn't even recognize her at first. The rest of the cast is all well chosen. Excellent performances all around.My criticisms of the film are brief. I only mention them because were it not for these simple faults, I feel The Green Mile has a shot at the greatest film of all time title, and yes, I know that's saying a lot.1) The movie was too long. There comes a time when you need to pick a storyline from the book and then throw the book out. Everything this film said and did could have easily been done in 2 hours and it would have had more impact. It also would have left the audience wanting more, like Apocalypse Now, vs. A.N. Redux.2) I found the foul language and adult situations to be distracting from the topic and genre. A more traditional approach here would have made for a more timeless and accessible work. The language was too on the head (see point 4) 3) I didn't like the special effect of how John Coffey heals. It was too... Steven Kingish? A more subtle approach would have been more thought provoking, which leads me to my last point...4) The movie frequently tries too hard. It has 17 endings, like with Shawshank, it has endless underscoring of its messages and points, it rambles, it over-explains, it hits the nail on the head -- twice, just in case you missed the first one. It would take pages to explain this point in detail, so suffice to say, if you agree, you know what I am talking about, and if you disagree, you will love this film all the more.I know this is sacrilege to filmmakers and impossible, but I would love to see a highly edited version of this film. Take out the healing effects. Cut the modern day beginning and ending off. Remove the language (it's a cruel world, okay okay, I get it), cut massive amounts of build up and redundancies.

You can't have the sound up as high as you'd want and the sound of her gently breathing (or snoring if you're being harsh) make me want to close my eyes as well. A feeling amplified many times whilst watching this dull romantic drama, which spent a lot of time going absolutely nowhere with what might have been a good premise.Helen (Kate Capshaw) runs an easy-going bookstore in a sleepy US coastal town, the sort of place where time goes by very slowly. Emotionally frigid and resolutely single, she finds a mysterious love letter in her post and believes it's for her. As her stony heart begins to melt, she begins a relationship with her work colleague Johnny (Tom Everett Scott) who both believe that the letter is meant for them. But is Johnny the author or is it Helen's long-time admirer George (Tom Selleck), who feels his last chance with Helen slipping away.This is one of those horrible films that never gets out of first gear. It's painfully slow, dragging on and on and way beyond the point where the viewer has figured out who the author and intended recipient actually is. And quite frankly, you don't really identify with any of the characters because they are little more than cold, wooden stereotypes. Surprisingly, Selleck probably provides the best of the performances but in truth, nobody looks like they're putting much effort into it - Selleck is basically playing his Richard character from Friends without a moustache. The comedic lines are few and far between and there is no chemistry at all between Capshaw & Scott, meaning it fails as a romantic film as well. So all it does is spend the film's duration telling it's story and by the time the credits have rolled by, you'd have already forgotten about it.Aside from the premise, I'm struggling to see what attracted such an experienced and talented cast to this boring snore-fest. This is a film so easy-going, it's damn-near comatose. Neither entertaining nor challenging, I cannot think of a reason why you should watch this hugely disappointing movie. The Love Letter is as dull and uninspired as its title and trust me, don't watch this film unless you are an insomniac or a fan of any old romantic dross on TV.

As I learned in a fairy tale class in Lewis & Clark College just this past semester, some people think that the original fairy tale may have been about sexual maturation, the way she goes to sleep and wakes up a new person. Certainly sleep is a non-productive period, providing an opportunity for rebirth, perhaps? As for the spindle, that presents an interesting aspect spinning was almost exclusively done by peasant women, so was it saying that if a princess tries to engage in it, strange things will happen? Does the curse mean that she'll never be able to do work that women are supposed to do? And the whole part about getting pricked by it was that a sexual innuendo? The whole part about the castle shutting down while she sleeps provides food for thought. While we were discussing Sleeping Beauty and its variants in the fairy tale class in early April, I noted that if an entire castle - or other such entity - had fallen asleep exactly one century earlier and just now woken up, they would have missed the entire 20th century (and specifically, they would have just missed the Great San Francisco Earthquake). So, everyone on earth would have to explain everything that happened throughout the 20th century and first few years of the 21st century (I would hope to be the one to explain popular culture).

In particular, and in contrast to standard Hollywood fare, redemption and forgiveness were in the air.

At this point, Jamie forgives him. Likewise, Jamie apologizes for not telling Landon earlier about her illness, and he forgives her. Landon's father eventually redeems himself for leaving his family by paying for Jamie's home-care, and Landon forgives him in a scene that, even after a dozen viewings, still gets me.

The reason this story speaks to all ages and all audiences is because it wraps a feminist fable in a very familiar and male-friendly format. It is actually a classic male buddy drama in which the heroic males just happen to be two very beautiful and highly intelligent women. When Joanna (Katherine Ross) comes to Stepford, she doesn't fit in. And she soon teams up with Bobbie (Paula Prentiss) who is always laughing and joking, yet also feels like an outsider. So you have a brooding, intense, thoughtful hero, and a sidekick who is playful, funny, carefree and charming. Think of Pruitt and Maggio in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY. Think of Paul Newman and George Kennedy in Cool Hand Luke. Think of Paul Crewe and his buddy Caretaker from THE LONGEST YARD. It's a standard male scenario -- a loner against the system, with only one good buddy beside him. Paula Prentiss' Bobbie Marco is so much like Frank Sinatra's Maggio. Both sidekicks warn the hero early on that there is trouble ahead. (Oh, my friend, you made a very bad mistake. This outfit they can give back to General Custer!) Both share the same fun, outgoing, friendly personality. Bobbie is an especially delicious character. She's so stunningly sexy, yet completely funny and down to earth. You just want to hug her. She's the caring best friend every woman wants to have -- and the knowing older woman every teenage boy dreams of being seduced by after school. She taps into the deepest fantasies of both sexes in a very reassuring way. Now, if you look at the men of Stepford, you notice that they are really sort of shadowy figures. No one man is really a tough guy, a brute, or a bully. It's the system that is menacing, no one individual. Just like in Cool Hand Luke, the bosses are a faceless group, and they break Joanna down little by little, just like Luke. They never shout at her or call her a b**ch, nor do they use open physical violence. They are as smarmy and phony as Luke's Captain, who keeps saying he is punishing Luke for his own good. Joanna's husband, by the way, is a typical weak-willed philanderer, just like Capt. Dana Dynamite Holmes in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY. Just like Holmes, he feels pushed to agree to more and more cruelty against the decent outsider in order to prove himself to the male herd. You can't be decent to a man like that, you have to treat him like an animal!In the end, you know Bobbie and Joanna will be beaten by the Men's Group, just like Pruitt and Maggio will be beaten by the Army. But it's a hollow triumph, that of a faceless collective over deeply personal and lovable individuals. And the film's deepest point is not just the obvious feminist point that there's more to life than housework but a much larger (and already time honored) message of the rights of the individual against the power of the system.

From the moment it was made it was destined to be a classic. William Holden plays a B-movie screenwriter struggling in Hollywood and about to get his car repossessed when he pulls into a driveway of an old mansion owned by a silent screen star, played by Gloria Swanson, who has long faded from the public's and Hollywood's memory and lives as a recluse. Her butler, played by Eric Von Stroheim, is the first of her three husbands and who as former director discovered her. Holden grabs an opportunity to live in the mansion and write a screenplay for the Norma Desmond character's comeback to films. She falls in love with him with designs on him being her fourth husband and things start unraveling. Also in the cast are Nancy Olson, Fred Clark, Jack Webb and in wonderfully scripted cameo roles are a cast of stars from the silent movie era, director Cecil B. DeMille, actor-comedian Buster Keaton, actress Ann Q. Nilsson, actress-turned present day gossip columnist Hedda Hopper and actor H.B Warren. Stroheim is also from the silent era as is Swanson herself. She made 58 silent films in just 16 years between 1914 and 1930 and was one of Hollywood's biggest names but only made five films in the 30's and by 1934 with the film Music in the Air at age 37 her career ended. She returned in 1941 to make a comeback film but disappeared again until she got the role in Sunset Boulevard at the age of 53. A role she played so convincingly that it would typecast her as Norma Desmond and she only made one other film before disappearing from the big screen once again. She would show up occasionally on television and made a couple more screen roles late in her life. John Seitz is the film's cinematographer who himself got his start photographing silent films in a long 45 year career where he was never out of work. He had been the cinematographer on such silent film classics as The Prisoner of Zenda, The Arab, and Scarmouche to name a few so he was an ideal choice to photographer this film. His career also would go on to include The Lost Weekend, The Big Clock, Double Indemnity and Sullivan's Travels. Famed writer director Billy Wilder was making a name for himself and had already directed such pictures as The Lost Weekend, A Foreign Affair and Double Indemnity. Wilder wrote the screenplay with Charles Brackett and D.M. Marshman Jr. The film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and won three for Best Art Direction, Best Music Score and Best Screenplay. among it's 11 nominations were Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Editing and a heavily nominated cast in Holden for Best Actor, Swanson for Best Actress, Olson for Best Supporting Actress and Von Stroheim for Best Supporting Actor. The Academy Awards for 1950 were All About Eve vs. Sunset Boulevard with the two films nominated for a total of 25 awards with nine nominations between the two casts alone. Sunset Boulevard also won four Golden Globe Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress and Best Score and received an additional three Globe nominations. It's film noir, drama, satire, dark comedy and comes close to a horror story too. If you like any or all of those genre categories you'll like this film. If you have an appreciation for the silent era films as I do you'll like this even more. I give it a 10 out of 10.
