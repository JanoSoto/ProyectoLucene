'Marvin's Room' could have easily been just another one of those sentimental disease-of-the-weak type TV films but McPherson stays true to the story injecting it with a delightful dose of humour. The film focuses on broken relationships and how it's never too late to take the step to mend them until you're gone. The execution is simple and that works very well. The score is in sync with the flow. The writing is beautiful. The dialogues are cleverly written.Diane Keaton is marvelous in a role that could have easily turned out to be a cliché if it were played by a lesser actress. She plays her part naturally with a quiet and yet layered restraint. Meryl Streep does a fine job as the slightly more rebellious and estranged sister who had escaped from having to take care of her father and is proud of her diploma. Leonardo Dicaprio isn't bad either. Robert De Niro is great in a more laidback role. He also reveals a flare for comedy. His scenes with a splendid Dan Hedaya had me laughing. Gwen Verdon is a delight and she provides excellent comic relief. Hume Cronyn doesn't have a scene out of bed but he definitely makes the viewer take note of his performance.My favourite scene is towards the end when the two sisters chat in the kitchen. Keaton's Bessie may have been 'consumed' by taking care of her ailing father and aunt, not 'leading' her own life like the typical American woman but the amazing thing is that she doesn't regret it because she is proud that she has given them so much love and that she can do the same now with her sister and nephews. Then there's the ending which is superbly done. You're left wanting to know how these wonderful characters are doing but at the same time one can acknowledge that it's the best way to end.

Unfortunately, while sounding like a clever idea, utilizing the if it ain't broke, don't fix it motto, only a handful of films can get away with. With comedy films, it's especially rare and difficult, since many thing that existed in the first film are now close to obsolete. Most recently, we can say what an utter disappointment The Hangover Part II was, and for animation, I can see a look of sorrow and woe on all our faces when we paid to see The Jungle Book 2. Also, how many parents felt just a tiny bit cheated when they ventured out with their kid to Home Alone 2 Lost in New York? I bring this up because, being an avid moviegoer and watcher, I experience it a lot, and probably tend to notice it more than other people. I expected American Pie 2 to be nothing but a mediocre rehash of a formula I believed would only form a successful film once. The element of surprise is gone, the characters have grown up a bit, and there just doesn't seem to be a conceivable way to freshen the idea without taking an obviously lucrative turn. Thankfully, screenwriter Adam Herz, who also wrote the first Pie film, has made me eat those words along with his second helping of pie. American Pie 2 is one of the few comedy sequels I've seen that efficiently redoes what the original paved out, yet still includes that new movie smell.The plot revolves around the same bunch of characters we loved in the first film, only this time they're not naive high school Seniors days away from graduating, but less naive College kids on summer break. Jim (Biggs), Kevin (Nicholas), Oz (Klein), and Finch (Thomas) all return and plan to throw an unforgettable bash at a Grand Harbor lakehouse in Michigan. Not a whole ton has changed with the guys, Jim hasn't gotten over foreign exchange hottie Nadia (Elizabeth), Kevin is still desperately seeking Vicky (Reid), after cutting their relationship short to attend separate colleges, Oz is still dating the adorable choir girl Heather (Suvari), and Finch still has not gotten over his fling with Stifler's mom (Coolidge).When Jim learns that Nadia will be returning from Chicago to see him during the summer, he seeks the advice of quirky but lovable Michelle (Hannigan), whom he took to Senior Prom. The chemistry between the two is electric, and you almost crave to hear Hannigan recite the famous six words I doubt you need repeated. Also, some of the funniest work comes from Eugene Levy, reprising his role as Jim's father who continues to be supportive and understanding of his son's bizarre sex accidents. It seems Levy exists as the satirical character in a world where the kids are in a comedy movie. The unexpected mix works perfectly with the overall feel. The only character I feel is still painfully underused is Natasha Lyonne's Jessica, who seems like she could deliver more if the screenplay let her. Maybe she is supposed to be mysterious and subtle in her presence.There is a bit more of a focus on gross-out gags here than in the first film. One scene involving potential lesbian neighbors is stretched out a bit too long, and loses some of its humor over time. There is also a scene involving urine which isn't very funny, but we're thrilled to see these characters back again, cherishing and embracing each of their sitcom personas.Like in the original film, there is a nice blend of sweetness and wit to compliment a lot of the gross antics, making for a nice hybrid. We've only spent two movies with these characters, but somehow feel we've personally connected with them in a way that makes us crave more events involving them. It's so rare we get characters like this, and everyone here seems to be determined to make a great, fun movie. So many people just look at the original Pie trilogy and see it as nothing but a reviled sex romp and nothing more. Many don't pay attention to the intelligence and spirit that makes these films so delightfully enigmatic and cheery. That's what the Pie is all about.I just have one tiny question for the gang this time around. We are informed of the rule of three where if you ask a girl how many guys she has slept with, you take that number and multiply it by three. Okay. Fair enough.

As he tries to improve Hoyt's street IQ, Alonzo appears to push the boundaries of what is acceptable policing to their absolute limits, forcing Hoyt to question both his own motives and those of his superior. The film is all about asking yourself one question how far would you go in order to do the right thing? And without trying to sound righteous, this is a question that all of us must ask ourselves from time to time. Do I do the right thing and refuse or capitulate and go with the flow? It is this theme of morality that lifts Training Day beyond the mire of most cop movies. The other huge bonus is the performance of the two leads - both Washington and Hawke are brilliant, utterly compelling and believable in their respective roles. However, I think that the Oscar went to Washington for two reasons. One he is playing totally against type. Washington isn't known for playing characters with a prominent dark side, let's be honest.

It sounds ridiculous on paper, but strangely, makes less sense after viewing it. I have seen it twice in the last two months, and it has become one of my favorites.The acting in Eraserhead ranges from solid to outstanding. Jack Nance's performance as Henry Spencer is superb (at least in my opinion). The majority of his screen time does not consist of dialogue, and he conveys Henry's emotions well, particularly those of discomfort and uneasiness. Charlotte Stewart does a passable job as Mary, the mother of Henry's mutant child. Most of the movie consists of scenes involving these two characters. The other actors and actresses perform their roles as needed, and the film does not suffer from any bad acting.Eraserhead's cinematography is mostly standard, and serves the story well. The film utilizes some creative shots, and from what I remember, held my attention for the duration of the movie. Eraserhead's visual effects are about what you'd expect from a low-budget film. They are done well enough not to induce any cringing or vomiting, except of course where they are intended to. The sound effects, on the other hand, are the strongest aspect of Eraserhead's technical performance. Because dialogue is not featured prominently, what the viewer hears becomes a major part of their experience. In one scene, I was more concerned with a bubbling sound in the background then with what was happening on-screen, so much so that I had to rewind to see if I'd missed anything important. Not that the sound effects are distracting, but they are so captivating and pleasing. Even the sound of the baby's constant crying was mesmerizing.While all of these components affect the viewer's perception of the film's quality, it is ultimately its storyline that will either make them a fan or severely disappoint them. Director David Lynch is known for leaving interpretation of the film's strange imagery and shocking conclusion up to the viewer, and for keeping its intended meaning to himself. Those who do not enjoy applying symbolism or greater meaning to media, or are just too lazy to try, will likely walk away from this movie with disgust. Personally, I took pleasure in thinking critically about the film's message and applying my own meaning to it. My interpretation after my second viewing is entirely different from what I originally thought, and I'm willing to guess it will change after viewing it again, which I most definitely plan on doing.Eraserhead is not a film for every viewer, especially those accustomed to movies made purely for thoughtless enjoyment.

These films are so overly present in the history of science-fiction\/fantasy films. Even in the last decade or so we have seen these films being constantly produced (see The Matrix (1999) or Avatar (2009) as just two recent examples). It's the narrative of a young man, who progresses through a story to become the legendary myth of a person embodied as the saviour for an entire race, universe, galaxy... However, if we move back to 1984, the Hollywood film industry was still trying to capture that cash-cow essence of Star Wars (1977) and it's celebrated special effects, and it's fantasy setting. Therefore, any project that had space-ships, monsters etc were being made regardless of their relationship to the kids film. Dune, based on the epic and elaborate novel by Frank Herbert, is a very complex piece of cinema, that baffled many audience's and critics alike (I personally can't see that it is confusing at all). But then, if we look at the majority of the genre films made at the time, we can see how it could be see as perplexing next to the generic, simplistic stories being told. Inevitably, the film was a major flop, and with the $40 million budget, practically bankrupted 20th Century Fox, and also (thankfully) convinced director David Lynch to never work on a big budget, Hollywood-funded film again, and due to his contract with Dino De Laurentis, he was able to make his masterpiece, Blue Velvet (1986).Dune is a narrative of warring planets, and the machinations of the politics that rule the galaxy. Dune is a desert planet that has never seen water, and on this planet is a substance called spice melange, that is the most important essence in this world. Whoever controls the spice controls the universe. The spice enables a means of travel without moving; it has the ability to fold space, and also expands consciousness. The main warring houses are of the Atriedes and the evil Harkonnens. Paul Atriedes (Kyle MacLachlan) is the son of Duke Leto (Jurgen Prochnow), and his mother Lady Jessica (Francesca Annis) who is a member of the Bene Gesserit, a race of women who are able to read minds and control the minds of others. With his royal connections, Paul is held in high regard. But as the story progresses it is clear that there is more to this boy that was first expected. After a conspiracy to create a war between the Atriedes and Harkonnens, Paul and his mother are left stranded on the planet Arrakis (also known as Dune), where the prophecy of the saviour and the dreams that Paul had been haunted by, comes to pass.Whilst the films narrative complexities are difficult to concisely lay down the full story, the essence is very simple. It is incredible that Lynch's screenplay managed to deal with Herbert's book, which is incredibly sprawling, but he managed admirably. The sets and costumes for the film are incredible, and even today (and after seeing the films several times) I am amazed at the look of the film. The costumes and props are incredibly eclectic - we have iconography from all over the place Victorian austerity, 1930's telecommunications items, Nazi-style uniforms, and elaborate baroque back-drops. OK, so many of the special effects are incredibly dated, and others seem to have been cobbled together at the last moments on a shoe-string budget, but this does not hinder the experience of the film. Produced at a time when complex genre films were simply not being made, it is a film to watch several times, which reveals more each time. It was a project that was always going to be difficult to produce, with two other notable directors being previously attached to the film (Ridley Scott and Alejandro Jodorowsky - wish the latter happened with the proposed cast of Salvador Dali and Orson Welles, and music by Pink Floyd), it's amazing the film was made at all, and I salute Lynch for an admirable, often visually beautiful, and delightfully complex film, that I love more each time I see it.The film also has an incredible supporting cast (Brad Douriff, Jose Ferrer, Patrick Stewert, Max Von Sydow, Dean Stockwell, to name a few), and there are very Lynchian elements that delight me every time.

These films are so overly present in the history of science-fiction\/fantasy films. Even in the last decade or so we have seen these films being constantly produced (see The Matrix (1999) or Avatar (2009) as just two recent examples). It's the narrative of a young man, who progresses through a story to become the legendary myth of a person embodied as the saviour for an entire race, universe, galaxy... However, if we move back to 1984, the Hollywood film industry was still trying to capture that cash-cow essence of Star Wars (1977) and it's celebrated special effects, and it's fantasy setting. Therefore, any project that had space-ships, monsters etc were being made regardless of their relationship to the kids film. Dune, based on the epic and elaborate novel by Frank Herbert, is a very complex piece of cinema, that baffled many audience's and critics alike (I personally can't see that it is confusing at all). But then, if we look at the majority of the genre films made at the time, we can see how it could be see as perplexing next to the generic, simplistic stories being told. Inevitably, the film was a major flop, and with the $40 million budget, practically bankrupted 20th Century Fox, and also (thankfully) convinced director David Lynch to never work on a big budget, Hollywood-funded film again, and due to his contract with Dino De Laurentis, he was able to make his masterpiece, Blue Velvet (1986).Dune is a narrative of warring planets, and the machinations of the politics that rule the galaxy. Dune is a desert planet that has never seen water, and on this planet is a substance called spice melange, that is the most important essence in this world. Whoever controls the spice controls the universe. The spice enables a means of travel without moving; it has the ability to fold space, and also expands consciousness. The main warring houses are of the Atriedes and the evil Harkonnens. Paul Atriedes (Kyle MacLachlan) is the son of Duke Leto (Jurgen Prochnow), and his mother Lady Jessica (Francesca Annis) who is a member of the Bene Gesserit, a race of women who are able to read minds and control the minds of others. With his royal connections, Paul is held in high regard. But as the story progresses it is clear that there is more to this boy that was first expected. After a conspiracy to create a war between the Atriedes and Harkonnens, Paul and his mother are left stranded on the planet Arrakis (also known as Dune), where the prophecy of the saviour and the dreams that Paul had been haunted by, comes to pass.Whilst the films narrative complexities are difficult to concisely lay down the full story, the essence is very simple. It is incredible that Lynch's screenplay managed to deal with Herbert's book, which is incredibly sprawling, but he managed admirably. The sets and costumes for the film are incredible, and even today (and after seeing the films several times) I am amazed at the look of the film. The costumes and props are incredibly eclectic - we have iconography from all over the place Victorian austerity, 1930's telecommunications items, Nazi-style uniforms, and elaborate baroque back-drops. OK, so many of the special effects are incredibly dated, and others seem to have been cobbled together at the last moments on a shoe-string budget, but this does not hinder the experience of the film. Produced at a time when complex genre films were simply not being made, it is a film to watch several times, which reveals more each time.

They enter the film like The Three Stooges, immediately undermining the tension that their entrance generates. I mean, for the film to work as strongly as it could, they should be a major threat, but instead they enter the film while bickering like a bunch of numbskulls. And two of them even think they can break through concrete and three inch steel with a sledgehammer. You're dealing with mental midgets here.Stupidest of the three is Leto's character. He doesn't know how escrow works, he puts his head against the wall when Foster is about to ignite the gas they're pumping into the panic room, he shouts at a PA system and he exposes his plan to screw over his fellow burglars simply by talking to himself. The extent of his stupidity is really too much to ask of an audience with any intelligence and his whole character smacks of lazy writing.But thankfully Leto's character gets shot halfway through. And his killing is nicely done. It's quick, it's brutal and it allows the unhinged Raoul to step up to the plate as the main villain. And although Raoul is a knob and a bit of a rent a psycho, he does seem like a genuine threat. And it's even more impressive considering that the actor who plays him, Dwight Yoakam, is a country music star. He may sing hick music, but he turns in a superb performance.But although Yoakam is excellent, the film easily belongs to Foster. She's strong, she's resourceful and she's entirely believable as a mother who'll blow your head off if you mess around with her kid. After all, is there anything more dangerous than a mother backed into a corner? Personally I'd rather take on a 6 foot 4, 300-pound, bum-hungry redneck called Bubba than a 5 foot 4 woman who wants to defend her kid. The burglars should have left the second they realized they were dealing with a 'mom'.However, while I can easily believe in Foster managing to wrestle a gun off of the psychotic Raoul (again illustrating how stupid the thieves are, Raoul at one point tells her to come out of hiding so he can shoot her and get things over. Didn't he ever have a mum?), her MacGyver routine stretches credibility &#x96; igniting the gas is fair enough, but there's one bit where she somehow hooks up the phone line. She even says, I have no idea when her daughter asks her what she's doing. It's obvious that Koepp (the writer) has written himself into a corner and this is the result suddenly she's a phone expert. But I'm willing to overlook these sorts of things as Fincher gives us ample opportunity to stare at Foster's cleavage when things get silly. It was actually an excellent decision to have her spend virtually the whole film in a black vest, as you're never too far from jiggling breasts, which is fair compensation for gaps in logic.

Its depiction of the fun, spontaneous antics that exist in high school don't take the nihilistic or dehumanizing route many films of the same genre do. Some have written the film off as unoriginal, and while it really isn't, it's a comedy for a new generation. The seventies had National Lampoon's Animal House, the eighties had Porky's, and the nineties got a nice helping of pie.The film follows four naive Michigan high school students, who are close to each other, but not to the people they truly want to be close to; girls. Jim (Biggs) is a pasty, awkward teenager hoping to get lucky with the foreign exchange student Nadia (Elizabeth), Chris Oz Ostreicher (Klien) is the all-star lacrosse player trying to make things work with the sweet, innocent, and charming choir girl Heather (Suvari), Kevin (Nicholas) is the self-confident and sexually motivated one of the group, hoping to have sex with his girlfriend Vicky (Reid) before they go off to separate Colleges, and Finch (Thomas) is the shy, solemn soul who usually sits idly by while the antics unfold. The four make a pact to lose their virginity by the end of high school, hoping to make it all happen the night of Senior Prom. The gang's motivation comes from their loudmouth buddy Steve Stifler (Scott), who is unapologetically crude, yet irresistibly lovable.Perhaps the funniest character in the entire film is Jim's dad (Levy), who must be the most conscious and understanding father in the history of film. Many teen films portray parents as out of touch codgers with no knowledge or comprehension of current events. Jim's dad is the total opposite. He is way too understanding, even when his son tries to practice his moves on a baked apple pie.One character that seems tragically underused is Vicky's friend Jessica (Lyonne). The character is seen at rare points in the film, usually providing her friend with sex insight. She seems like the black sheep of the group, who doesn't fit in anywhere and doesn't really want to. When she does turn up on screen, usually for a slender amount of time, she is witty and fun, much like the rest of the characters.I was never hugely fond of the eighties' generation-definer Porky's. I found it to be a little weak on the characterization, yet still on par with its projection of high school students. The reason why American Pie soars high on the grading scale is because it manages to provide us with lovable characters that would become familiar to us like those in a sitcom. These characters are sunny and infectious with their one-liners and their wisdom. They aren't indulgent, meaning they are always learning new things and reciting a good moral or two. After not seeing the film in many years, the end scenes were a big surprise to me. It shows the characters are gaining insight and knowledge; I thought that simply couldn't happen in a teen movie. The end also goes in a way one did not expect. I was crossing my fingers that it wouldn't turn into the cartoony cliché I was thinking, and what do you know, it turned out to be just as sweet as the film itself.What a joyous and lovable excursion American Pie is. It provides well delivered, intelligent laughs and realizes that it doesn't need to discover a new breast per screen ratio in order to be funny or memorable. It introduces us to naive, confused teenagers, perhaps somehow reflecting ourselves at the time, and goes from there in what appears to be a totally fresh take on the subject of losing ones virginity. It is simple, efficient, and wholesome even when it shows its darker side.Starring Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan, Chris Klein, Natasha Lyonne, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Tara Reid, Mena Suvari, Eugene Levy, and Eddie Kaye Thomas.

There's also never clever plot twists, and aside from a few interesting moments such as seeing the killer in the police station at the beginning standing around, and says hello to a cop, there's nothing for your mind to play around with, unlike the almost poetically structured ending to Seven, that will leave you confused for a while until everything clicks in your mind. I'm not saying it's a bad film, it's quite enjoyable, but I must say that in comparison to Seven, Copycat's no where near as good, and in all due respects you should see Seven instead!

I don't why it's got such a low rating, it's not Shane. or something like that. This movie is supposed to be a far-out, macabre comedy, and that's exactly what it is. Dan Aykroyd's idea of a criminally insane small town judge who rules with an iron fist and will run you through his Bone Stripper if he takes a personal dislike to you is a take-off of the old stereotype of the crooked small town sheriff who goes out of his way to hassle people from out of town. Having a 6'4, 300 lb. daughter to marry-off (John Candy) was a brilliant touch. This ain't Ben Hur and it's not supposed to be.Worst movie ever? You gotta be kidding me! A literal sea of bad comedies have been made but this isn't one of them. Most movies don't even keep my attention the whole way through because they're so bad, but this one did. Something tells me that criticism came from someone who works in the legal or law enforcement field, and it hit too close to home.I think that one of the best parts of this movie was Chevy Chase. He's always very funny and he's pretty much the same no matter what movie he's in. He is easily one of the most talented of the original SNL cast, and I have enjoyed all his films. Fletch is another great one. ","genre":null},{"date":"21 March 2012","score":"","review":" I saw this whacky movie back in 1991, and I thought it was AWESOME!

This film is a excellent war epic all the way down to the perfect customs. Director Michael Mann takes you into this detailed action that is staged with excitement and excellence. Mann knows how to direct action sequences with such grace because he draws you into Daniel Day-Lewis's character and you actually feel for him. I want to see Michael Mann direct another action film! The Last of the Mohicans is based off the novel of the same title. The script for this film is impeccable. It is written with the right amount of action, great dialogue, & the perfect love story. The Last of the Mohicans has excellent performances from just about the whole cast, but the incredible, Daniel Day-Lewis has another flawless performance. What I believe makes Day-Lewis stand out as one of the greatest actors is that he becomes his characters. When you watch the films he is in your not watching Daniel Day-Lewis, your watching the character. His use of method acting is perfection and shines in The Last of the Mohicans down to the last second. This film has one of the best scores I have ever heard in a war film composed by Trevor Jones. I can't say much about the score because I don't know a lot of the aspects that go into creating the score for films, but I can say the score in The Last of the Mohicans is unforgettable. The Last of the Mohicans is a excellent period piece, extremely well done war film, and the perfect love story.

Star Wars does a great job of introducing all of the characters that are so important to the Star Wars films. Luke Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, Darth Vader, and Han Solo. They all are great. Also it establishes the main conflict of the film right off the get go. Because of how great they do of establishing characters and conflict it allowed the sequels to succeed as well and further continue from this film.Also the story is awesome in this film. Luke Sky-walker, a farmer, becoming a Jedi knight and going on an adventure to help rescue the princess. This is a great story about how someone who thought they were nothing becomes something that is truly needed.The action is legendary. There is plenty of laser fire in this film and who could forget the epic attack of the death star towards the end of this film. Films like this show that you do not need constant action through the whole film at every part. There is great setting up of events prior to much of the action taking place. This helps establish the conflict and allows for the audience to understand the situation and why the action must take place.Music is awesome as well. Star Wars always had the best music of any film. However Star Wars does not have nearly as good of Music as The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Or even as good of music as was in the three new Star Wars films.

We Were Soldiers was one of my favorite war films growing up and still is one of my favorites. Director, Randall Wallace, takes you into this gritty, realist war film. What stands with the directing style of, We Were Soldiers, is the use of a steadicam affectively for action sequence. When you watch this film you get right into the middle of the action, seeing all the detail and emotions. I like the film grain; it adds to the grittiness of war. The performances in We Were Soldiers are great and succeeds with giving the characters life. It's always bad in films characters are so flat and lifeless because of the acting and character development. You get none of that in this film. Mel Gibson leads in We Were Soldiers and this by far one of his best performances of his career. The emotion you feel from beginning to end from Gibson is astounding. From the very beginning you see that he cares about being a parent, husband, & soldier. By the end of this film Mel Gibson has my eyes tearing up because of how much he loves his country and soldiers. The only tiny problem with this film is that it falls to little war movie clichés, but that didn't bother me. We Were Soldiers comes highly recommended for those who love war films.
