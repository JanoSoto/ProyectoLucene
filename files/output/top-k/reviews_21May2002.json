This movie was so bad, it made Double Jeopardy look like Schindler's List, and we all know how I felt about Double Jeopardy. This movie was so amazingly bad, I don't even know where to begin. I must have checked my watch a dozen times waiting for this monstrosity to be over. How in the hell does a movie like this get made?Let's start with what is supposed to be the plot. Ewan McGregor plays The Eye (get it?), a British Secret Service Agent. He is asked to follow the son of some rich guy to find out if the son is stealing from his trust account. While staking out the kid, he sees Joanna Eris (Ashley Judd) kill the kid. Instead of being an officer of the law and telling on her, he decides to follow her around. Apparently because the ghost of his missing child tells him to. So while Joanna (or whatever her name is at various times through the film) goes around killing people and screaming about her Daddy, The Eye just follows her around. Somehow everywhere she goes, he manages to get a place to stay really close to her, and set up various spy cameras and hidden microphones. She wanders around aimlessly going all over the United States looking for god knows what. The Eye falls in love with her and will do anything to make sure she doesn't fall for anyone else, going so far as to attack and later kill her fiancée. I have no idea what else the plot was supposed to be. I'm not even sure there was a plot. Just a lot of voyeurism and Ashley Judd wearing a lot of different wigs.This movie was crap. No two words about it, it was crap. And I get the feeling everyone who rents this will feel the same way. I should have turned it off the minute the opening credits rolled. But no, I thought, hey, how bad could it be? Well, this movie has now entered my list of the top 5 worst films I have ever seen in my life. We're talking a few thousand movies I've seen over my 25 some odd years, and this is one of the worst. I felt so sick and disgusted after walking turning it off, I had to rent Here on Earth to make me feel better. First off, the story was preposterous and annoying. Secondly, the characters had no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I was wishing they'd all die just to make the movie interesting. Third, the music was some of the worst I've heard in a film. Every so often the music would get really loud, as if they were trying to cover up the crap on film. I know this movie was made before Ashley made Double Jeopardy (and I still don't know how that movie made any money), and before Ewan became the man in The Phantom Menace. Hopefully their careers won't suffer too much because of this film. I still don't have any proof that Ashley Judd is a good actress, but she definitely has a star quality about her. Sadly, star quality doesn't help this script get any better. Every time she cried and screamed about Daddy and Christmas, I wanted to shoot myself so I wouldn't have to listen to her.There were two saving graces in the movie. One was the fact that no one seemed to talk a lot. So I didn't have to listen to Judd try and act. I think she had two monologues throughout the entire film. Oh yeah, before I forget, K.D. Lang, please stick to your day job. Like I said, I don't think Ashley Judd is that good an actress, but K.D. Lang makes Judd look like Meryl Streep. Who thought of casting her in this role? The second saving grace lasted only about 5 minutes, and that was Jason Priestly. His role as the psychotic druggie was the only decent thing about the movie. Of course he shows up late in the film, and then gets the hell kicked out of him 5 minutes later. But for every second he was on screen, he actually made the movie that much better.So overall, Eye of the Beholder, to put it bluntly, sucked. I can't believe I paid $4.75 to sit through an hour and 40 minutes of sheer hell; at least it was on my couch, and not in some uncomfortable theater seat. I would rather sit and watch Here on Earth 100 times than sit through this movie again. If you only listen to me once then listen to me now... Do not, for any reason, rent this movie. Yes, Ashley Judd gets naked, briefly, but if you want to see her naked, go out and rent the TV movie she did with Mira Sorvino about Marilyn Monroe. Eye of the Beholder was, and probably will forever be, one of the worst films I ever see in my life.

Jake was sent to prison a few years back for murdering his wife. While he was gone, his son Jesus (Ray Allen, former Big East player of the year from the University of Connecticut) has become the best high school basketball player in the country.

Jesus has never forgiven his father for what he did, so when Jake returns into Jesus' life, things don't go well. The ending was not much of a surprise, and the movie itself wasn't done as well as I had hoped.I didn't know if the movie was about the relationship between Jesus and Jake, or if it was about the pressures the top high school basketball players have to go through when deciding whether to go to college or go pro. The relationship between father and son seemed strange, and I think a lot of that had to do with the inexperience of Allen as an actor, and the writing of the film. Sometimes their relationship seemed horrible, sometimes it seemed like they got along OK. I don't think Allen had a lot of range of emotions. He could speak the lines with emotion, but couldn't act the emotion at the same time, if that makes sense. As far as the pressures high school players feel, sometimes it came through, sometimes it didn't. The scene with the agent at his house, was very powerful.

He's told a wonderful story very well.. well paced, well executed. And yet, so many morons complain. Why do they complain? Simple... They are morons. Wait, before I continue, let it be known that I very much consider myself a Star Wars Geek. But after watching some of the people who waited in line for ten or more days just to see the movie opening night(I waited two hours to see it at the same time, dummies), and all I heard on the news was It better be better than Episode One, Lucas has lost his touch, etc. Well, it was, and he hasn't. Why the attack of the Star Wars Geeks out there? Simple enough to answer. They can't just enjoy it anymore. Star Wars has become more than a wonderful series of highly entertaining movies. It has become more than religion to these fools with no lives. They live their lives as if they had family on Alderaan when it was blown up, as if they were nearly destroyed by the Death Star. As if Han Solo loved them, but for some reason fell in love with a hot princess. Get over yourselves, you geeks! Simply put, Episode II Attack of the Clones, was a wonderful movie, with great special effects and a solid plotline. While the acting isn't quite Lawrence Olivier, it is passable enough for the film.

For everything that takes place in Eyes Wide Shut, to me it just boils down to one man dealing with the thought of his wife being with someone else. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) is married to Alice (Nicole Kidman). One night Alice tells Bill that she once had a fantasy about giving everything in her life up, for one night with a man she saw the previous summer. This somewhat upsetting news leads him to one of the strangest nights of his, or anyone else's for that matter, life I've ever seen.It starts with a visit to an old friend, goes to a prostitute, follows into a bar, goes to a costume shop, and ends up at one of the weirdest orgies I've ever seen. Then again, I've never been to one so who am I to say it's wierd. There is a lot of nudity, and a lot of talking in this movie. It's very slow moving. The characters seem to have to draw everything out by repeating things over and over. If someone asks a question, the answer has to include that same question. A few times I wanted to yell, Just spit it out already!. The story was just plain odd. Bill, after finding out about his wife's fantasy, ends up walking around New York. Everywhere he goes he is tempted by a beautiful woman. Whether it's a prostitute, a friend, a man pimping his daughter, or a woman in a mask, someone always seems to want him. And the question is, will he give in to his temptation and, in his mind, get back at his wife? Or will he not allow himself to cross that line?The performances were pretty good overall. Tom Cruise again shows why he is so successful as an actor, and not just another pretty face. He gives more of a subtle, laid back performance this time. His facial expressions and emotions don't go very far, but that's the sort of tone the entire movie has. Nicole Kidman, who wasn't in the movie nearly as much as I thought she would be, also gives a fine performance. I saw her character as being very sexual, someone every man would want, which is why Tom Cruise's character deals with so much after hearing about her fantasy. Sydney Pollack is the only other person in the film who showed up for more than a few scenes. Everyone else had their part and then left. Leelee Sobieski was the only other person I really recognized, and she had a very small, yet revealing part. Being that this is Stanley Kubrick's last film, I suppose I should say something about the filmmaking. I've only seen two other Kubrick films in their entirety, and those were 2001 and A Clockwork Orange. I've also seen parts of The Shining, and the one thing they've all had in common, is that they are very deliberate. Kubrick takes a lot of time to get the audience to see everything that goes on around the characters. Every shot, every sentence is milked as much as it can. While it tends to make the films longer than most other directors would make it, it also makes it very full. I'm not sure how else to say it. You never feel like something is missing from a scene. From the set design to the music, every scene is full of life. Especially in this film. From the apartment sets to the orgy, the look of the movie was very distinct. And the music, especially that haunting piano, kept me on the edge of my seat. Overall, Eyes Wide Shut is definitely not for everyone. To many it will seem extremely boring, and the ending not very spectacular. To others it will be considered a masterpiece. To me, it fell somewhere in the middle. Not the greatest film ever made, not even the best Kubrick film ever made, but something that will definitely go down in history.

For everything that takes place in Eyes Wide Shut, to me it just boils down to one man dealing with the thought of his wife being with someone else. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) is married to Alice (Nicole Kidman). One night Alice tells Bill that she once had a fantasy about giving everything in her life up, for one night with a man she saw the previous summer. This somewhat upsetting news leads him to one of the strangest nights of his, or anyone else's for that matter, life I've ever seen.It starts with a visit to an old friend, goes to a prostitute, follows into a bar, goes to a costume shop, and ends up at one of the weirdest orgies I've ever seen. Then again, I've never been to one so who am I to say it's wierd. There is a lot of nudity, and a lot of talking in this movie. It's very slow moving. The characters seem to have to draw everything out by repeating things over and over. If someone asks a question, the answer has to include that same question. A few times I wanted to yell, Just spit it out already!. The story was just plain odd. Bill, after finding out about his wife's fantasy, ends up walking around New York. Everywhere he goes he is tempted by a beautiful woman. Whether it's a prostitute, a friend, a man pimping his daughter, or a woman in a mask, someone always seems to want him. And the question is, will he give in to his temptation and, in his mind, get back at his wife? Or will he not allow himself to cross that line?The performances were pretty good overall. Tom Cruise again shows why he is so successful as an actor, and not just another pretty face. He gives more of a subtle, laid back performance this time. His facial expressions and emotions don't go very far, but that's the sort of tone the entire movie has. Nicole Kidman, who wasn't in the movie nearly as much as I thought she would be, also gives a fine performance. I saw her character as being very sexual, someone every man would want, which is why Tom Cruise's character deals with so much after hearing about her fantasy. Sydney Pollack is the only other person in the film who showed up for more than a few scenes. Everyone else had their part and then left. Leelee Sobieski was the only other person I really recognized, and she had a very small, yet revealing part. Being that this is Stanley Kubrick's last film, I suppose I should say something about the filmmaking. I've only seen two other Kubrick films in their entirety, and those were 2001 and A Clockwork Orange. I've also seen parts of The Shining, and the one thing they've all had in common, is that they are very deliberate. Kubrick takes a lot of time to get the audience to see everything that goes on around the characters. Every shot, every sentence is milked as much as it can. While it tends to make the films longer than most other directors would make it, it also makes it very full. I'm not sure how else to say it. You never feel like something is missing from a scene. From the set design to the music, every scene is full of life. Especially in this film. From the apartment sets to the orgy, the look of the movie was very distinct. And the music, especially that haunting piano, kept me on the edge of my seat. Overall, Eyes Wide Shut is definitely not for everyone. To many it will seem extremely boring, and the ending not very spectacular. To others it will be considered a masterpiece. To me, it fell somewhere in the middle. Not the greatest film ever made, not even the best Kubrick film ever made, but something that will definitely go down in history. And if that's not reason enough to go see it, I don't know what else is.

Woody Allen, who so often has demeaned other directors and writers for making movies that seem unworthy of the medium has just made a movie for no other reason than he was given the money to do it.  I cannot believe Woody Allen put this thing together and thought it was good.  He couldn't.  IT'S AWFUL. It's UNWATCHABLE.It's thrown together like three eggs about to be scrambled.

In one scene, someone mentions he should buy a mercedes and he says, I can't be driving around in a 29 Mercedes, people will mistake me for Himmler.

And it's a TERRIBLE decision.  He also has many jokes later in the movie about a guy whose act is biting the head off of rats, and then we get several rathead-biting comments in the film. It's a TERRIBLE MISCALCULATION.  The FIRST rat-joke wasn't funny, it was STUPID. None of these jokes have any wit.Two times in the movie, Woody tries to evoke his past genius.   One is a cocktail scene early on when some literary names are banted about, and some sex jokes with it, ala Manhattan.  Also, there is a scene where Lea Teoni and Treat Williams talk for an extended time the camera stays still while they go in and out of the room talking.  It's very Hannah-Crimes-Husband and it would have worked, but the dialogue is so bad, you don't even care.A worst movie ever would be one in which someone takes TERRIBLE advantage of you as a fan and a movie-goer, and then insults you in the process.

Which is exactly what happens when a young couple from different sides of the street fall in love, in the landmark musical West Side Story, directed by Robert Wise, with staging and choreography by Jerome Robbins. The streets of New York City are the setting for this contemporary version of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, the drama of which plays out within the confines of a microcosmic world which encompasses a sparse few city blocks and is ruled by rival gangs, the Jets and the Sharks, who are constantly vying for territory and whose soul purpose in life is protecting their turf. Tony (Richard Beymer) is a former Jet, once one of their leaders, in fact, but has left it all behind in an attempt to get on with his life. His best friend, Riff (Russ Tamblyn), however, is still the leader of the Jets, who are currently embroiled in their ongoing fight with the Sharks. Maria (Natalie Wood) is Puerto Rican, and her brother, Bernardo (George Chakiris) is the leader of the Sharks. And when circumstances bring Tony and Maria together and they fall in love, it sets the stage for tragedy on a grand scale, all of which is captured on the screen in this film, the most celebrated musical of all time.When a movie earns ten Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director (Jerome Robbins also received a special award for choreography), it clearly indicates that this is a film of extraordinary merit. And this one is-- by anyone's measuring stick. Told through the magic of music, presented through the dramatic and driving Oscar winning songs and score of Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim, Shakespeare's tragic love story becomes a transporting, memorable experience that is at once a sweeping visual extravaganza while at the same time an intimate chronicle of the romance between the star-crossed lovers, Tony and Maria. Lavishly staged, the film evokes a true 1950's sensibility while retaining the agelessness of the passion at the heart of the story. The production numbers are dynamic, from the quietude of the enthralling and poignant Maria, and the perky, uplifting I Feel Pretty, to the energetic Dance At The Gym and the thundering, dramatic strains which accompany the rumble. This is an example of filmmaking at it's best, brought to fruition through the talents of Wise, Robbins and a superlative cast and crew, whose many and varied individual contributions are too lengthy to mention here.This may not have been Natalie Wood's greatest role, but she is nevertheless unforgettable as Maria. She is charming and beautiful, with riveting, dark eyes that speak volumes about her character. Her accent is passable, if not perfect, but most importantly her natural ability as an actor enables her to create a very real, believable person in Maria. There's an endearing vulnerability about her, yet in her eyes you find the pride and determination that makes Maria strong. It's a solid performance, and just one of the many reasons this film was so well received.This was without question Richard Beymer's day in the sun, career-wise, and his portrayal of Tony is credible, but fairly lackluster. If a weakness in the film could be singled out, it would be his performance; still, he does well enough, but in the end his work here is average, to say the very best. As his buddy, Riff, Russ Tamblyn comes across much better, and makes the most of showcasing his considerable talents in what is one of his most memorable roles, as well.The performances that really steal the show, however, are turned in by George Chakiris as Bernardo, and Rita Moreno as Maria's friend, Anita; both of whom deservedly received Oscars in the Best Supporting categories for their work here. Chakiris, with his dark, good looks has never been more convincing or better in any role, and he has a commanding presence especially in the production numbers. And Moreno is in a class all her own as the fiery Anita; she dominates the screen whenever she is on, especially during the dance at the gym and in the rousing America. She is such a vital presence in this film, and along with Chakiris, more than helps in bringing the music and story to life. Also in supporting roles that add so much to this film and demand to be singled out, are Tony Mordente, as Action; Tucker Smith, as Ice; David Winters, as Arab; and Eliot Feld, as Baby John. The additional supporting cast includes Simon Oakland (Lieutenant Schrank), Ned Glass (Doc), William Bramley (Officer Krupke), Bert Michaels (Snowboy), Susan Oakes (Anybodys), Gina Trikonis (Graziella), Carole D'Andrea (Velma) Jose De Vega (Chino), Jay Norman (Pepe) and Gus Trikonis (Indio). An emotionally involving story underscored by a blood-stirring soundtrack, West Side Story is without question one of the all time great movie musicals, thoroughly entertaining and presented with the kind of flare that is rarely even attempted anymore. Within the genre, it's the best of the best, the realized vision of a group of extraordinary artists. Earning Oscars, as well, for Cinematography, Costumes, Art and Set Direction and editing, this is a prime example of the true magic of the movies.10\/101961 151 minutes CC.

She is charming and beautiful, with riveting, dark eyes that speak volumes about her character. Her accent is passable, if not perfect, but most importantly her natural ability as an actor enables her to create a very real, believable person in Maria. There's an endearing vulnerability about her, yet in her eyes you find the pride and determination that makes Maria strong. It's a solid performance, and just one of the many reasons this film was so well received.This was without question Richard Beymer's day in the sun, career-wise, and his portrayal of Tony is credible, but fairly lackluster. If a weakness in the film could be singled out, it would be his performance; still, he does well enough, but in the end his work here is average, to say the very best. As his buddy, Riff, Russ Tamblyn comes across much better, and makes the most of showcasing his considerable talents in what is one of his most memorable roles, as well.The performances that really steal the show, however, are turned in by George Chakiris as Bernardo, and Rita Moreno as Maria's friend, Anita; both of whom deservedly received Oscars in the Best Supporting categories for their work here. Chakiris, with his dark, good looks has never been more convincing or better in any role, and he has a commanding presence especially in the production numbers. And Moreno is in a class all her own as the fiery Anita; she dominates the screen whenever she is on, especially during the dance at the gym and in the rousing America. She is such a vital presence in this film, and along with Chakiris, more than helps in bringing the music and story to life. Also in supporting roles that add so much to this film and demand to be singled out, are Tony Mordente, as Action; Tucker Smith, as Ice; David Winters, as Arab; and Eliot Feld, as Baby John. The additional supporting cast includes Simon Oakland (Lieutenant Schrank), Ned Glass (Doc), William Bramley (Officer Krupke), Bert Michaels (Snowboy), Susan Oakes (Anybodys), Gina Trikonis (Graziella), Carole D'Andrea (Velma) Jose De Vega (Chino), Jay Norman (Pepe) and Gus Trikonis (Indio). An emotionally involving story underscored by a blood-stirring soundtrack, West Side Story is without question one of the all time great movie musicals, thoroughly entertaining and presented with the kind of flare that is rarely even attempted anymore. Within the genre, it's the best of the best, the realized vision of a group of extraordinary artists. Earning Oscars, as well, for Cinematography, Costumes, Art and Set Direction and editing, this is a prime example of the true magic of the movies.10\/101961 151 minutes CC.

And, forever after, anyone invading their turf had better have a good reason, because within this imaginary domain a peer status is also established, and to some-- especially the ones at the top of the pyramid-- this becomes all they have or will ever hope to have in their entire lives. But there is one thing that will ultimately, at least for some, supersede this delusional monarchy, and that thing is universal Love. Which is exactly what happens when a young couple from different sides of the street fall in love, in the landmark musical West Side Story, directed by Robert Wise, with staging and choreography by Jerome Robbins. The streets of New York City are the setting for this contemporary version of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, the drama of which plays out within the confines of a microcosmic world which encompasses a sparse few city blocks and is ruled by rival gangs, the Jets and the Sharks, who are constantly vying for territory and whose soul purpose in life is protecting their turf. Tony (Richard Beymer) is a former Jet, once one of their leaders, in fact, but has left it all behind in an attempt to get on with his life. His best friend, Riff (Russ Tamblyn), however, is still the leader of the Jets, who are currently embroiled in their ongoing fight with the Sharks. Maria (Natalie Wood) is Puerto Rican, and her brother, Bernardo (George Chakiris) is the leader of the Sharks. And when circumstances bring Tony and Maria together and they fall in love, it sets the stage for tragedy on a grand scale, all of which is captured on the screen in this film, the most celebrated musical of all time.When a movie earns ten Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director (Jerome Robbins also received a special award for choreography), it clearly indicates that this is a film of extraordinary merit. And this one is-- by anyone's measuring stick. Told through the magic of music, presented through the dramatic and driving Oscar winning songs and score of Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim, Shakespeare's tragic love story becomes a transporting, memorable experience that is at once a sweeping visual extravaganza while at the same time an intimate chronicle of the romance between the star-crossed lovers, Tony and Maria. Lavishly staged, the film evokes a true 1950's sensibility while retaining the agelessness of the passion at the heart of the story. The production numbers are dynamic, from the quietude of the enthralling and poignant Maria, and the perky, uplifting I Feel Pretty, to the energetic Dance At The Gym and the thundering, dramatic strains which accompany the rumble.

Dennis Quaid (Frank) and James Caviezel (John) star as a father and son, the only difference being the father is in 1969 while the son is in 1999. It seems a solar flare up has allowed these two to talk to each other over an old ham radio. Whether or not you accept this possibility can go a long way to deciding whether or not you enjoy the movie. I accepted it and moved on. After a short period of non-belief, Frank comes to believe that this man he talks to really is his son in the future. But when John tells his father something that saves Frank's life, they also change the course of history. Now all of a sudden John's mother is murdered by a serial killer because of something Frank did differently in the past, and the two of them must rush to find the killer and save their family. The biggest problem with these types of movies, at least in my mind, is wondering how it's possible that if you change something in the past, the present is almost exactly the same. Other than in the Back to the Future movies (part 2 to be exact) where everything is different, in most time shifting movies, everything is generally the same, except for one or two minor changes. I always believed that if you changed something in the past, no matter how insignificant, the future would be changed in ways no one could imagine.

And why is her name Lucretia?--Burt Reynolds recalls 'Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?', not because he's in a wheelchair, although he is, but because his make-up must have been put on a with a paintbrush, like Jane Hudson's was.  There are some very unflattering close-ups of Burt, too. You don't get a flashback story about why 'he's in that chair' but I would have killed to see him get tortured a little, just for fun, in a movie that provides the laughs anyway, just not outright. --The trio of racers (Jimmy, Beau & Memo) look like they were filming a gay porn movie and accidentally stepped onto this set.  In some ways, this movie is porn-level in terms of acting and dramatic intensity.--Gina Gershon is just around to call everyone an a**hole, basically.  She is Sly's ex-wife and now married to Memo Moreno, a plastic name if there ever was one.  Gina breathes fire and has a semi-decent scene in a ladies room with Stacy in which they almost come to blows. It does not rival Patty Duke v. Susan Hayward in 'Valley of the Dolls', but she seems to know the whole thing is a lark so lets loose a little, which is appreciated in a movie where every actor onscreen is so constipated.--To be fair, screenwriter Sly does not give himself all the big scenes, and does not make the victories his.  But the man responsible for so much bad dialogue at least had the sense to spread it around.  His race with Kip Pardue (Jimmy Bly), at 195 mph, through the streets of Chicago, is another highlight and the only time I laughed, and I laughed a lot.  A police officer clocks their speed but obviously was not concerned enough to follow them or anything.  Both men get hit with a fine of $25,000 but the Chicago cops had nothing to say about it at all.  Incredible. Robert Sean Leonard is around to annoy everyone and to cause unnecessary dramatic conflict.  The slap he gets was from Estella was from the heart, I am sure.  Originally I watched this only to see Kip, who played Sunshine in 'Remember the Titans' but I am glad I saw it, for its camp-value, ridiculous acting, dialogue cribbed from fortune cookies and bumper stickers, and for its throwback value.  Every generation seems to get a race car movie built around a soap opera - others are 'Bobby Deerfield', 'Grand Prix', 'Winning' and 'Days of Thunder', but they didn't have Stallone writing the script and Renny Harlin directing...luckily.

Is one magazine article enough of a reason to follow the race car circuit all around the world?  Why is she given communication with the racers while they are racing?  And why is her name Lucretia?--Burt Reynolds recalls 'Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?', not because he's in a wheelchair, although he is, but because his make-up must have been put on a with a paintbrush, like Jane Hudson's was.  There are some very unflattering close-ups of Burt, too. You don't get a flashback story about why 'he's in that chair' but I would have killed to see him get tortured a little, just for fun, in a movie that provides the laughs anyway, just not outright. --The trio of racers (Jimmy, Beau & Memo) look like they were filming a gay porn movie and accidentally stepped onto this set.  In some ways, this movie is porn-level in terms of acting and dramatic intensity.--Gina Gershon is just around to call everyone an a**hole, basically.  She is Sly's ex-wife and now married to Memo Moreno, a plastic name if there ever was one.  Gina breathes fire and has a semi-decent scene in a ladies room with Stacy in which they almost come to blows. It does not rival Patty Duke v. Susan Hayward in 'Valley of the Dolls', but she seems to know the whole thing is a lark so lets loose a little, which is appreciated in a movie where every actor onscreen is so constipated.--To be fair, screenwriter Sly does not give himself all the big scenes, and does not make the victories his.  But the man responsible for so much bad dialogue at least had the sense to spread it around.  His race with Kip Pardue (Jimmy Bly), at 195 mph, through the streets of Chicago, is another highlight and the only time I laughed, and I laughed a lot.  A police officer clocks their speed but obviously was not concerned enough to follow them or anything.  Both men get hit with a fine of $25,000 but the Chicago cops had nothing to say about it at all.  Incredible. Robert Sean Leonard is around to annoy everyone and to cause unnecessary dramatic conflict.  The slap he gets was from Estella was from the heart, I am sure.  Originally I watched this only to see Kip, who played Sunshine in 'Remember the Titans' but I am glad I saw it, for its camp-value, ridiculous acting, dialogue cribbed from fortune cookies and bumper stickers, and for its throwback value.  Every generation seems to get a race car movie built around a soap opera - others are 'Bobby Deerfield', 'Grand Prix', 'Winning' and 'Days of Thunder', but they didn't have Stallone writing the script and Renny Harlin directing...luckily.

I'd rather watch Jar Jar and Yoda have sex for an hour and a half than this drivel. Endless amounts of poorly conceived, glib repartee, mercilessly interrupted by frequent thousand foot leaps from speeding hover cars (with just in time rescues from certain death) and so many light saber battles that my eyes are still seeing flashes of blue, green, and red (oh yeah, and Mace's purple helmeted warrior - I mean light saber).The whole romance thing between Anakin and Padme had me cringing and saying yeesh more times than I could count. The part where he talks about how sand is rough or something and that she was soft and smooth was one of his better lines, if you can believe that! Her confession of love for him just about made me puke. I hope I can forget it.C3PO gets his head chopped off. Miraculously, he stumbles into a conveniently empty space in a robot assembly line and his body gets a new head while his head, again miraculously, gets a new body. Geez!

This little muppet whipping back and forth, twirling through the air was comedic genius!I'll be generous and attribute special effects and fighting to 40% of the movie. I'll give it a 4 out of 4 here. As for the rest, somewhere between a 1 and a 2 out of 6 for a total of 5 or 6 out of 10 (I'm pretty easy on movies).

Yoda looked much more lifelike when he was a puppet ... also the clone army (stormtroopers of the future) weren't even real people.  At least they didn't look real to me.  Whatever happened to hiring guys to dress up in costumes instead of creating a fake cyber army.  Ridiculous.  Maybe if Lucas reverted to the technology he used back in the late seventies things would be better.  Those movies had a look to them that is totally lacking in the first two prequels.  The realistic touch and human side to the movies is gone and the digital dehumanized look of the new ones is just not welcome.  Try again George... but how about spending more money on little things like scripts and a good director.  May the force be with you.
