However, this time the Caped Crusader receives help from Dick Grayson (Chris O'Donnell), a young man not unlike Bruce, who together must save Gotham once more.The main problem I had with the plot of Batman Forever is that it has no direction and was clearly made by merging the ideas of two different parties. There is a darker subplot of Bruce delving into his past to recount his parents' death, which fits perfectly into the established universe here and really works, but then there are zany action scenes and ridiculous set-pieces that shatter any of the realism or depth that the film was trying to create. The film, for the most-part, takes time to set up characters and their relationships with others, mainly with Dick Grayson and the Riddler, who have decent chunks of time dedicated to developing their characters. Although I didn't like the Riddler (I'll get on to that later), I appreciate the efforts made to flesh out his character.Like its plot, the characters of Batman Forever are a mixed bag. Val Kilmer is, in my opinion, pretty great as Batman, and he delivers a mostly dark and brooding performance as the Bat and his alter-ego, which I was definitely impressed with. Unfortunately, the villains are the main problem. Tommy Lee Jones' Two-Face is simply horrendous hammily acted with poor dialogue and costumes, with little to no background to flesh out his character and very unclear motives. Jim Carrey's Riddler is another confusing one, since his character is developed fully and he has plenty of screen-time, but I just hated his performance. The Riddler in the comics is not zany and doesn't bounce off the walls and chew the scenery, and is intellectually equal to Batman, trying to outsmart him, which is touched upon but never fully realised here. I was also left with a bitter taste from Nicole Kidman's Chase Meridian, since she has some superb character moments and good chemistry with Kilmer's Bruce Wayne, but towards the first half comes across simply besotted with Batman without her own interests, which I found corny and cringe-worthy.The best parts of Burton's Batman films were the designs be it the Batsuit, Gotham City or the Batmobile, everything was stylish and fit in perfectly with the tone of the film. The same can't be said for Batman Forever, where the Batmobile has been simply ruined thanks to neon wheels and tacky gadgets, and the Batman himself has been vandalised due to those dreaded Bat-nipples. Oh God. Gotham City is now plagued with neon lights and ridiculous gangs that would never intimidate anyone in the real world, and it all ends up making the film even less believable than it already was, a true shame considering the quality of Burton's designs.Director Joel Schumacher's cinematography is mediocre and at times downright embarrassing. There were far less of the spectacular establishing shots of Gotham than in Forever's predecessors, and the few shots that did stand out were for all the wrong reasons. Why, on God's Earth, would you take Batman, a dark, brooding hero who strikes fear into the hearts of his enemies, and give him nipples on his costume, and moreover, have entire shots focused on his crotch or rear? It baffles me that these decisions were given the green light, and it unfortunately goes to show that in contemporary cinema, the amount of money made is valued more than decent storytelling or sticking to the source material. The film's CGI, when rarely implemented, is also abysmal, and if I had to compare it to any other film it would be Alien 3. In both cases, the CGI looks unfathomably bad and is incredibly jarring, and I would argue that the CGI from Batman Returns, released 3 years before this, is far superior.Not everything about Batman Forever is terrible thanks to the few character-driven moments that give fans of Burton's films something to look out for. I love the fact that it delved much deeper into Bruce Wayne's past, which gave him a layer of depth that hadn't been explicitly explored before, and character moments, such as between Bruce and Chase and then Bruce and Dick, are fantastic when executed correctly if this film had focused on its plot more than its action, it potentially could've been superb. There are also a couple of easter eggs to look out for if you're a fan of the comics; my particular favourites being the Metropolis reference, the 'Excelsior' casino, the array of previous Batsuits and the suggestion of 'Nightwing' as Dick's superhero name.Batman Forever isn't a train-wreck per se, but falls down due to its lack of focus and muddled storytelling and tone. It doesn't know whether it wants to appeal to those who like Burton's grittier, story-driven films, or those who want to see Jim Carrey chewing the scenery and nipples on the Batsuit, eventually ending up satisfying nobody.I give Batman Forever 5.5 out of 10.

It seems like a lot of the people on these IMDb message boards and reviews for this movie Space Jam are around the same age I am and remember watching this movie when we were younger. My parents still have this movie on VHS, and I remember giving it to my older sister for her 17th Birthday, but I don't think she ever really watched it, or maybe once. Whenever I watch this movie, it's a trip down Memory Lane. I still remember it pretty well from when the movie was new and when I was a kid watching it on VHS.Here is what makes this movie interesting. Well, there are lots of sports movies including certain sports movies for kids. From what the internet tells us, this movie is still the highest grossing basketball movie to date, and keep in mind this movie is almost 20-years old. In this movie, we get to see real basketball players who play themselves. Obviously, the main one Michael Jordan. We also have Charles Barkley, Patrick Ewing, Mugsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, and Shawn Bradley. We also have Bill Murray in this movie who plays a character with the same name, but not supposed to be the same person.What makes this movie entertaining. Well, Michael Jordan was talked about more in the '90s. He doesn't seem talked about so much anymore. But, I think that was nice of him to star in a fun entertaining movie where the target audience was kids. Kids being able to see their hero in an entertaining 1.5 hour movie. This movie wasn't a documentary featuring him or a movie about his life, but a movie for entertainment. Yeah, it's a movie featuring Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes. We've all seen the Looney Tunes cartoons, Merry Melodies and those cartoons are from decades ago, but we still remember the characters and the sound effects including the sound effects where a character like Wile. E. Coyote falls off a cliff. That sound effect sounds like a bomb being dropped from a military plane. It's just cool seeing a plot involving Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes, and the movie will definitely keep us entertained and our eyes on the screen.So, I enjoy watching this movie. It still entertains me as an adult. With sports movies that have been made and ones that will be eventually make for kids, we can ask which one will come out next? I believe there is a Space Jam 2 in the works. But, if they could make a certain sports movie for kids, this is one I'd love to see becoming a film even though I doubt it will become one. The funniest book I've read in my entire life is a 1993 book called, The Toilet Paper Tigers by Gordon Korman. I crack up while reading it and in terms of reading I'd recommend it for you if you like reading. With coming up with new ideas for sports films, that would be awesome if they did a well done version of that book into a movie.To conclude, if you want to relive your childhood days, or the days when Michael Jordan was a bigger athlete, you can watch this film. You most likely will consider it Fun\/Entertaining!!

While some argue that Costner was too humorless and brooding for the part, there are quite a few places in the film where he can be seen smiling and having a good time, like when he makes it back to England after the Crusades or when he's spending time with Marian in Sherwood Forest. Thankfully, he's more three-dimensional than that and so you also see him desperate, angry, grieving, vengeful, strategizing, contemplative, etc. To be honest with you, Costner was in his prime at the time and towers in the role; whether or not you like him is a matter of opinion. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Marian is memorable with her unique facial features and odd hairstyle even though she doesn't trip my trigger. Morgan Freeman as the Moor Azeem is an excellent partner for Robin Hood while Alan Rickman and Michael Wincott are effective villains as the Sheriff of Nottingham and Guy of Gisborne respectively. Christian Slater, Nick Brimble and Michael McShane are also on hand as Robin's sometimes merry men, the latter two being Little John and Friar Tuck. I've always had mixed feelings about this movie due to its mixed tone. As far as medieval films of the British Isles go, I prefer the more serious and consistent tone of 2010's Robin Hood, 2006's Tristan + Isolde and 1995's First Knight. While Robin Hood Prince of Thieves is often serious and brutal, it's also sometimes cartoonish and over-the-top. Rickman particularly hams it up, entertaining though he is. Another good example is Geraldine McEwan as the ee-vil witch Mortianna. Her portrayal is a spooky and Gothic in a comic book horror kind of way, but it detracts from many parts that establish the story as believable quasi-history. Still, she's excellent as the hideous witch. One last example is the semi-goofy or overly epic\/heroic action scenes like Robin Hood & Azeem being catapulted over the castle wall. Why sure! Another negative is that the movie's overlong by at least fifteen minutes. Nevertheless, it's an entertaining Robin Hood adventure and iconic of early 90's cinema. The entire first act is the best followed by the many Sherwood Forest sequences; and the climatic cameo by a certain famous actor is a great touch. I enjoy seeing it every five years or so. The film runs 143 minutes and was shot mostly in England, but also France.

If you married young and have a life and kids and everything, the popular culture portrays it as a failure to live your life completely. Let's get to the movie before I elaborate. Enter Francesca Johnson an Italian war bride who is married to a hardworking, honest, down to soil farmer who loves her but as usual he has many other things to care about rather than serenading his wife all the time. The husband takes the two kids off to Illinois Country fair and Francesa declines the invitation to come along. Enter Robert Kincaid, a dashing devil may care, rangy, cowboy photographer. He's intense he loves his job and roams the world like a free wind. No tangles no relations to hold him down. And obviously Francesca stumbles hopelessly in love with him. Now my point is lady, that guy is like the text book definition of a cool guy he's charming and he has these philosophies and ideas and all this is very appealing to Francesca. But we must keep in mind a passionate 4 day affair is easy a life time of camaraderie and support is another.

It is also enjoyed by people who are both film aficionados and former- law students. The film dramatizes the trial of an army lieutenant who shot and killed a resort owner after he raped his wife. We see none of this violence, so the action is in the dialogue and the emotions. Here, the film is a success- the acting and dialogue is smooth and believable, heavy but eased with occasional wisecracks. I watched Witness for the Prosecution (1957) at about the same time and thought the ending lacked these qualities; I was quite satisfied with Anatomy of a Murder.Not showing us any of the violence, the film allows the viewer to piece together what happened along with James Stewart's character. We meet the lieutenant, described by Stewart as hostile and insolent, not very likable. We meet his wife, a free and easy type, attractive and friendly. The film teases us with possibilities- the prosecution suggests sex between the woman and victim was consensual, that her injuries were inflicted by her husband. But we know she passed a lie detector test and other evidence supports her story. Generally, the film makes us question whether the lieutenant really was under irresistible impulse- we get the feeling he wasn't, and it's debatable as to how much Stewart's character believed this himself, as he was coaching him on defence strategies in an early scene. As we piece together the mystery, the attention to detail is commendable- the lawyers press for details, addressing inconsistencies, as we see when Stewart wants to know if the dog was in or out of the truck during the sexual assault. This is, as the title suggests, where the anatomizing factors in.Some of that detail gets rather personal- when George C. Scott's prosecutor grills the lieutenant's wife on whether she always wears underwear, and relentlessly demands another female witness to say the victim was her lover. From one perspective he's doing his job, from another he is prosecuting women in general; with extensive testimony on how the wife was dressed and behaved, we see the old stereotypes and the old attitude that it was either consensual or that she was asking for it. Interestingly, Anatomy of a Murder dramatizes not only a murder trial but an old-fashioned rape trial, a sort of two-for-one affair. In doing so, it uses blunt and courageous language defying censorship- sexual details, use of words like slut and bitch. The result is a powerful film, a trailblazer of sorts that retains its impact.

Although most producers do have this in mind, there's always that group that don't and make rehash after rehash after rehash of the same film. This has been seen in dozens of film series, some of which have pulled themselves out of mindless entertainment to crowd-flocking blockbusters and others from once respected initiators to abysmal box office bombs. The unfortunate thing is, most head down the wrong path. As for Sylvester Stallone's first entry into Hollywood with Rocky (1976), it struck such a memorable chord that Stallone ended up exploiting his fictional counterpart for a decade and then some. Sadly for many, if not all fans of this boxing franchise have found this entry to be the least enjoyable. Of which they are right but it certainly isn't garbage like some have said including Stallone himself shockingly.For what it's worth, although it does have a couple more problems than Rocky III (1982) and Rocky IV (1985), this fifth entry isn't simply a rehash in plot like the last two films. After returning home from his fight with Drago in Russia, Rocky and family head home only to realize they lose everything when they discover Paulie (Burt Young) lent all of the Balboa savings to a shady accountant that ended up committing fraud on their behalf. Having to sell majority of their possessions to have cash on hand, the Balboa family moves back to Philadelphia hoping to start a new. There, Rocky reopens Mickey's (Burgess Meredith) boxing hall but is continuously followed and harassed by George Washington Duke (Richard Grant) who is looking to get him back into the ring to make one more check of big money. However Adrian (Talia Shire) disagrees because after visiting the doctor it seems as if Rocky has irreversible brain damage that could get worse if he continues to fight.Trying to stay out of the ring, Rocky discovers a boxer named Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison) who he ends up taking under his wing. The writing, which was penned again by Sylvester Stallone although a little cluttered, at least has things to discuss. Unlike Rocky III (1982) and Rocky IV (1985), which were very straight cut and predictable this time there's things to think about. For those who are tired of the usual Rocky formula that consisted of promising to step down, but then is challenged by losing a friend and reclaims respect, this film goes a different direction. The direction by John G. Avildsen (the same director of Rocky (1976)) here is more family oriented, which to be honest is what made Rocky (1976) so compelling. Sure the sports aspect was fun too but it was the human storytelling that worked best. The concept of having Rocky deal with a less publicized life and starting back where he came from is fine. The problems start when Rocky begins focusing more on Tommy Gunn than his own son played by Sage Stallone. Of course events like these do happen in real life but these kinds of moments aren't the changes fans want to see in the main protagonist. It's careless and makes Rocky look like a clueless father. Even with this though because the original human characters are of more importance, it is better to see a different focus. Although there have been plenty of persistent antagonists before that Rocky has come up against, Richard Grant is by far the man who chews up the most scenery in the series. This man has one the most hammiest performances; talking extremely fast without stopping and continuously showing his teeth to the camera. He isn't a likable character but he is fun to watch. The Tommy Gunn character is fleshed out but unfortunately turns from sympathetic to unsympathetic over time. Here's what's going to turn off people for those who enjoyed the first four films. The biggest change audiences will see is the amount of boxing involved. Believe it or not there are scenes that have boxing in it - but none of them involve Rocky in the ring. The matches still entertain and pack enough energy to keep it lively but of course for anyone looking to see Rocky fight, will be disappointed either way.Another disappointment belongs to the director of photography. Instead of long time camera operator Bill Butler shooting for the production, this time Steven Poster took over. For Poster's work it's not that it was unwatchable or unsteady but it did not have the same feel as Butler's. For the last four films, Bill Butler's work contains numerous wide shots of urban and rural terrain and also concentrated on what was of importance for each installment. Here, Poster just feels like he's shooting because it's his job. There's no aspect to his shots that feel noteworthy of mentioning. Finally, the biggest blow was the music composed by returning veteran Bill Conti who scored every entry except Rocky IV (1985). Conti doesn't change anything, which is good but at the same time doesn't add anything other than updating the themes a tad by adding in a saxophone. Every other track feels like a cut and paste of other tracks Conti had composed from the other films. That's not to say they don't work but each entry should get some kind of an addition.Its direction is focused on the human characters more than the spectacle of the sport and although all threads don't head down the right path, they at least develop the original characters differently. Also Richard Grant as the antagonist is one hammy actor. But for those who are looking for the engaging boxing matches with Rocky involved, they will be ripped off. That and the music and cinematography are nothing special to mention either this time.

Midway became notorious battle as the site of the overwhelming victory of American carrier forcer over the Japanese fleet . This was the most stunning and decisive blow in the history of naval warfare which shifted the balance of power in the Pacific . Between 4 and 7 June 1942, only six months after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor and one month after the Battle of the Coral Sea, the United States Navy under Admirals Chester Nimitz (Henry Fonda) , Frank Jack Fletcher (Robert Webber), and Raymond A. Spruance (Glenn Ford) decisively defeated an attacking fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy under Admirals Isoroku Yamamoto (Toshiro Mifune) , Chuichi Nagumo (James Shigeta) , and Nobutake Kondo near Midway Atoll, inflicting devastating damage on the Japanese fleet that proved irreparable. It was Japan's first naval defeat since the Battle of Shimonoseki Straits in 1863 . The Japanese operation, like the earlier attack on Pearl Harbor, sought to eliminate the United States as a strategic power in the Pacific, thereby giving Japan a free hand in establishing its Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere . The Japanese hoped that another demoralizing defeat would force the U.S. to capitulate in the Pacific War and thus ensure Japanese dominance in the Pacific. The Japanese plan was to lure the United States' aircraft carriers into a trap. The Japanese also intended to occupy Midway as part of an overall plan to extend their defensive perimeter in response to the Doolittle air raid on Tokyo. This operation was also considered preparatory for further attacks against Fiji, Samoa, and Hawaii itself.The plan was handicapped by faulty Japanese assumptions of the American reaction and poor initial dispositions . Most significantly, American code-breakers were able to determine the date and location of the attack, enabling the forewarned U.S. Navy to prepare its own ambush. All four Japanese heavy aircraft carriers&#x97;Akagi, Kaga, Soryu and Hiryu, part of the six-carrier force that had attacked Pearl Harbor six months earlier&#x97;and a heavy cruiser were sunk at a cost of the carrier Yorktown and a destroyer . After Midway and the exhausting attrition of the Solomon Islands campaign, Japan's capacity to replace its losses in material (particularly aircraft carriers) and men (especially well-trained pilots) rapidly became insufficient to cope with mounting casualties, while the United States' massive industrial capabilities made American losses far easier to bear .

Midway became notorious battle as the site of the overwhelming victory of American carrier forcer over the Japanese fleet . This was the most stunning and decisive blow in the history of naval warfare which shifted the balance of power in the Pacific . Between 4 and 7 June 1942, only six months after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor and one month after the Battle of the Coral Sea, the United States Navy under Admirals Chester Nimitz (Henry Fonda) , Frank Jack Fletcher (Robert Webber), and Raymond A. Spruance (Glenn Ford) decisively defeated an attacking fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy under Admirals Isoroku Yamamoto (Toshiro Mifune) , Chuichi Nagumo (James Shigeta) , and Nobutake Kondo near Midway Atoll, inflicting devastating damage on the Japanese fleet that proved irreparable. It was Japan's first naval defeat since the Battle of Shimonoseki Straits in 1863 . The Japanese operation, like the earlier attack on Pearl Harbor, sought to eliminate the United States as a strategic power in the Pacific, thereby giving Japan a free hand in establishing its Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere . The Japanese hoped that another demoralizing defeat would force the U.S. to capitulate in the Pacific War and thus ensure Japanese dominance in the Pacific. The Japanese plan was to lure the United States' aircraft carriers into a trap. The Japanese also intended to occupy Midway as part of an overall plan to extend their defensive perimeter in response to the Doolittle air raid on Tokyo. This operation was also considered preparatory for further attacks against Fiji, Samoa, and Hawaii itself.The plan was handicapped by faulty Japanese assumptions of the American reaction and poor initial dispositions . Most significantly, American code-breakers were able to determine the date and location of the attack, enabling the forewarned U.S. Navy to prepare its own ambush. All four Japanese heavy aircraft carriers&#x97;Akagi, Kaga, Soryu and Hiryu, part of the six-carrier force that had attacked Pearl Harbor six months earlier&#x97;and a heavy cruiser were sunk at a cost of the carrier Yorktown and a destroyer . After Midway and the exhausting attrition of the Solomon Islands campaign, Japan's capacity to replace its losses in material (particularly aircraft carriers) and men (especially well-trained pilots) rapidly became insufficient to cope with mounting casualties, while the United States' massive industrial capabilities made American losses far easier to bear . The Battle of Midway, in combination with the Soviet victory against Germany at the Battle of Stalingrad half a year later, are considered by some to be the turning points of the Second World War .A historical picture with well staged scenes , it is accurate and being faithfully based on facts . well documented script shows major and minor blundering on both sides , creating tension enough . Great actors were assembled to bring to the big screen this important battle of WWII . Although many well-known players contribute their skills , they are overshadowed by the realistic re-creation of the climatic attack , abounding stock footage , and shots taken from Tora Tora Tora ! picture .

Looking back at your life of watching films, this one really stands out as unlike any other.The originality is a spectacle. If you're looking for a film that is original, will challenge you to think, and can talk about with your friends, this will not disappoint.This movie was groundbreaking in many ways. While the late 90s and early 2000s had their fair share of great classics, most of them were similar to each other. This came out of nowhere with a whole different pace and was unlike the tone of any of the other ones, but it was great in its' own respect.

John Hughes presents high school stereotypes, takes of their masks and expands them to the point of opening everyone's eyes. Real performances from real teenagers and emotions run wild over the course of Saturday detention. It's a shame this hasn't officially been turned into a stage play. The music is fantastic. This deserves to be watched by anyone who is, was, or ever will be a teenager. It's a time capsule that takes us right into the 1985 with the perms and fashions of a different universe. I feel like not enough credit is given to the wonderful Paul Gleason as principal Richard Vernon. He's seriously good, you guys.

The tension in the build up to the final races could be felt while watching it, particularly the 100 meters when the finalists are getting ready in the changing room. Although it was a real shame to see another Cambridge athlete Douglas Lowe who won gold in the 800 meters refused to be involved in the film. Also as a sports fan, I was disappointed that the main star of the 1924 Olympics was not even mentioned, the Phantom Finn Paavo Nurmi, who astonishingly won the 1500 and the 5000 meters within one hour of each other, setting Olympic records in both events, and Ville Ritola who also did a double of his own the steeplechase and the 10,000 meters while finishing second behind Nurmi in the 5000 meters. Bit of a mistake excluding the Flying Finns but as this movie was about British athletes, maybe that's why we only saw glimpses of them dominating their events during Eric Liddel's monologue when we see the Cambridge athletes struggling to compete. Anyway exclusions aside this movie is well worth a watch, its inspirational and it shows if your willing to work for something you can achieve anything if you set your mind to it.
