K. Simmons and an uncredited Gene Hackman.The screenplay has a plot that is an unusual mixture of romantic comedy and road movie.It was originally intended to be filmed as an independent production without major motion picture stars, but Roberts and Pitt, who had for some time been looking for a project they could do together, learned about it and decided to make it. It was directed by Gore Verbinski.In the story,a clumsy criminal is put in a position where he not only has to save his own skin, but that of his girlfriend in this comedy with strong undercurrents of romance. Jerry Welbach is a low-level Mafia mechanic whose ineptitude is countered by frequent bursts of dumb luck. Jerry's girlfriend Samantha wants him to get out of the business, and after his latest blunder lands capo Arnold Margolese in jail, so does mid-level crime kingpin Bernie Nayman. But Bernie insists that Jerry do one last errand for the mob before they let him find employment elsewhere -- he has to go to Mexico and recover a rare and very valuable pistol, which is said to be cursed. While Samantha objects to Jerry taking the assignment, he isn't in much of a position to argue; Jerry heads south of the border, while Samantha, in a huff, sets out for Las Vegas. Once in Mexico, Jerry finds the pistol easily enough, but making his way back to the States proves to be an unexpected challenge. Meanwhile, Jerry's superiors want insurance that he'll return with the goods, so they hire Leroy, a hit-man, to kidnap Samantha and hold her hostage until Jerry comes back. However, Samantha and Leroy quickly strike up a friendship, and she soon learns the gunman has a sensitive side he doesn't show to the world -- along with a few other secrets. The Mexican marked the first screen pairing for mega-stars Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt -- though, given the film's narrative arc, they play only a handful of scenes together.That made it less interesting just like the story - which was overbearing and boring at the same time.The comedy did not provide too many laughs and the romance between Jerry and Samantha was least interesting.Despite of the presence of the mega-stars,this is one movie that I mildly recommend as it falls short in entertainment.

Basically at Mayfield Place, Hinkley Hills, Missouri lives Ray Peterson (Tom Hanks), and his neighbours, Vietnam veteran Lt. Mark Rumsfield (Bruce Dern), teenager Ricky Butler (Corey Feldman) and often paranoid Art Weingartner (Scary Movie's Rick Ducommun) all have their questions about a house on the block. The family known as The Klopeks have lived in the mysterious, dreary looking old house across the way for a little while, but nobody has been seen any come in or go out of the house, and no-one knows what is going on inside with family members, there are suspicions with all the strange noises. Ray is on a long home vacation, and with his free time he decides with his neighbours that they should try and communicate with and bring out the strange family to answer their questions. It turns out it not just the house that is peculiar, but also the family themselves, with weird Dr. Werner Klopek (Henry Gibson), hick looking Hans (Courtney Gains) and elderly oddball Reuben (Brother Theodore), they even get to go in the house that is reasonably alright, but there is obviously awkwardness trying to get to know them. Eventually, with all the bizarre goings on, to the protest of their loved one, including Peterson's wife Carol (Carrie Fisher), Ray, Mark and Art decide that they should break into the Klopek compound and investigate all over, especially the basement, and find incriminating evidence of foul play, e.g. bodies or bones. In the end it at first looks like they had the neighbours all wrong, and that the big disaster is their high paranoia taking over and making them the weirdos, but actually Dr. Klopek was apparently murdering, as they find skulls in his car trunk, so it turns out alright for Ray and the good guys in the end. Also starring Wendy Schaal as Bonnie Rumsfield, Dick Miller as Vic the Garbageman, Star Trek Voyager's Robert Picardo as Joe the Garbageman, Gale Gordon as Walter Seznick, Bridesmaids' Franklyn Ajaye as Detective #1 and Mars Attack's Rance Howard, Ron and Clint's father as Detective #2. Hanks is fantastic with his overacting being mad and complaining, Ducommun is likable as the slightly moronic and theorising friend, and the other cast members are okay as well, it is essentially a conspiracy kind of thing played out like a humorous mystery with slapstick and weirdness thrown in, all in all not a bad comedy.

Indeed, amidst the two filmic adaptations of Puzo's Godfather novel as well as later on in the decade's war movie Apocalypse Now, sits his 1974 psychological masterwork The Conversation; a film slotting neatly in between either of the said gangster movie entries before being later rounded off by that Vietnam War piece one is tempted to say is the best of the lot. The Conversation is a quite incredible drama, a film about a man whose life consists of attempting to capture the genuine nature of other peoples'; a film about an ageing man whose expertise seemingly lie with the making sense of other person's existences when his own are nonexistent; a film about a man who takes it upon himself in this chapter f his life which we observe to untangle the communications of two very specific people within when he can barely at all formulate communications for himself. The film is a deft piece of work, a scintillating lower end drama mutating into a conspiracy thriller weaving its way around one man, and his lack of a life, doing his best to save that of two strangers'.Harry Caul (Hackman) is this man - a surveillance expert; someone with many years experience in the job and a large network of colleagues of whom reinvent, practise and hone their craft with an array of gadgets and other such things designed to spy on, infiltrate the lives of as well as generally capture what is required to be captured once designated folk have opened their mouths to speak. The film will open in a manner akin to Coppola's The Godfather, his previous film from the previous year; but where the first of three entries detailing Puzo's life-of-crime piece of fiction began with a slow track outwards from a man's facial features to reveal them speaking, thus encapsulating this notion of a what a suited gangster, shot in medium close up format, should look like before coming outwards to reveal more about the nature of the location and those whom inhabit it, The Conversation veers inwards from a city skyline and all the way up to an individual's face as they sit there eavesdropping.This idea of quite literally moving into a world after beginning with your more standard establishing shot so as to unearth truer natures becomes apparent &#x96; those of whom we listen in on, it is suspected, might be more involved in activity of a more sordid nature than is initially obvious. As we listen on, one of the two speaks of how they feel sorry for the homeless lying there on park benches, and we wonder why it might be that someone seemingly so compassionate would need to be stalked in the first place. The scene is additionally rife with this odd, neo-realistic vibe of people going about their business to what appears to be a true to life background of genuine people, and not extras, making their way through the world and surroundings; this, as Coppola's camera rolls on capturing it all. This parallel between capturing life or the invading of one's privacy through what Hackman's character does and how the non-diegetic camera intrudes on the lives of others comes across as rather prominent.Away from this nature of work, Caul's life is lonely and drab; a life mired in a sense of paranoia or suspicion simmering and waiting to break out. When an escort begins to talk to him and make conversation through questions, he gets agitated and other than this, we observe his low key birthday celebrations as a result of refusing a friendly neighbour's attempts to instigate something special. The real strife begins in Caul's life when he refuses to hand over the piece of film-come-recording he shot during the opening to someone representing his employer. This man is a young and somewhat slimy high-rise dwelling male individual; a man whose badgering and insistent tone that he take the goods off Caul causes us to be wrapped up in Hackman's character's world enough to think that the people with whom he shares the elevator ride back down again exist right there and then to be both wholly afraid and suspicious of, in so much they might, for some maddening reason, know of the precise nature of the aforementioned exchange and will attempt to wrestle the produce away from Caul.The film is a burning, agonising piece; a film so proficient and so workmanlike that, and very much syncing up with what it is those depicted within do, director Coppola has manoeuvred proceedings away from someone living an unglamourous San Francisco based life trudging on with their work and strained friendships and down a path encompassing both real fear and terror that is more broadly representative of a conspiracy thriller. The gear changes and shift changes are executed remarkably, the notions of characters and their distrust with certain prominent figures of such power maintaining a sociological tract of America's distrust with their system at around the time, with a further tract of technology infiltrating one's life and invasion of privacy through gadgets and technology eerily rearing up a whole forty or so years prior to here and now when such things are as prominent as ever. If one were to be mischievous, one could say it was the worst film Coppola made in the period 1970-80; if one were to be honest as one always tries, one would say it is a blinding exercise in atmosphere and tone hitting all the right marks.

The scene is additionally rife with this odd, neo-realistic vibe of people going about their business to what appears to be a true to life background of genuine people, and not extras, making their way through the world and surroundings; this, as Coppola's camera rolls on capturing it all. This parallel between capturing life or the invading of one's privacy through what Hackman's character does and how the non-diegetic camera intrudes on the lives of others comes across as rather prominent.Away from this nature of work, Caul's life is lonely and drab; a life mired in a sense of paranoia or suspicion simmering and waiting to break out. When an escort begins to talk to him and make conversation through questions, he gets agitated and other than this, we observe his low key birthday celebrations as a result of refusing a friendly neighbour's attempts to instigate something special. The real strife begins in Caul's life when he refuses to hand over the piece of film-come-recording he shot during the opening to someone representing his employer. This man is a young and somewhat slimy high-rise dwelling male individual; a man whose badgering and insistent tone that he take the goods off Caul causes us to be wrapped up in Hackman's character's world enough to think that the people with whom he shares the elevator ride back down again exist right there and then to be both wholly afraid and suspicious of, in so much they might, for some maddening reason, know of the precise nature of the aforementioned exchange and will attempt to wrestle the produce away from Caul.The film is a burning, agonising piece; a film so proficient and so workmanlike that, and very much syncing up with what it is those depicted within do, director Coppola has manoeuvred proceedings away from someone living an unglamourous San Francisco based life trudging on with their work and strained friendships and down a path encompassing both real fear and terror that is more broadly representative of a conspiracy thriller. The gear changes and shift changes are executed remarkably, the notions of characters and their distrust with certain prominent figures of such power maintaining a sociological tract of America's distrust with their system at around the time, with a further tract of technology infiltrating one's life and invasion of privacy through gadgets and technology eerily rearing up a whole forty or so years prior to here and now when such things are as prominent as ever. If one were to be mischievous, one could say it was the worst film Coppola made in the period 1970-80; if one were to be honest as one always tries, one would say it is a blinding exercise in atmosphere and tone hitting all the right marks.

Indeed, amidst the two filmic adaptations of Puzo's Godfather novel as well as later on in the decade's war movie Apocalypse Now, sits his 1974 psychological masterwork The Conversation; a film slotting neatly in between either of the said gangster movie entries before being later rounded off by that Vietnam War piece one is tempted to say is the best of the lot. The Conversation is a quite incredible drama, a film about a man whose life consists of attempting to capture the genuine nature of other peoples'; a film about an ageing man whose expertise seemingly lie with the making sense of other person's existences when his own are nonexistent; a film about a man who takes it upon himself in this chapter f his life which we observe to untangle the communications of two very specific people within when he can barely at all formulate communications for himself. The film is a deft piece of work, a scintillating lower end drama mutating into a conspiracy thriller weaving its way around one man, and his lack of a life, doing his best to save that of two strangers'.Harry Caul (Hackman) is this man - a surveillance expert; someone with many years experience in the job and a large network of colleagues of whom reinvent, practise and hone their craft with an array of gadgets and other such things designed to spy on, infiltrate the lives of as well as generally capture what is required to be captured once designated folk have opened their mouths to speak.

An unlikely bunch of would be dinners end up having to team up in order to try and survive.Marking the directorial debut for the late Dan O'Bannon, it injects a wonderfully quirky, comic sensibility into its raucous story, incorporating elements of farce into its mix with ease. It also populates its story with not the usual sex obsessed, personality deficient teenagers but a group of outcasts that is genuinely interesting and engaging. The pacing absolutely never lets up, delivering one riotous scene after another; this is energetic, spirited stuff. Even the zombies themselves - not the typical shambling kind, but relentless, speedy, and quite smart as well - are given a degree of personality. In addition to the movie's most popular zombie in the form of the foul, dripping Tar Man (Allan Trautman), we are treated to a Civil War soldier zombie, a half woman corpse with some of the most striking blue eyes one will ever see, and a midget zombie. The zombies even talk, and from one of them we're even given an explanation why they would crave brains in particular (this movie can take credit for introducing the eating of the brain idea into pop culture).Highly quotable dialogue is another plus, as well as the kick ass soundtrack featuring such cool groups as The Cramps, 45 Grave, Tall Boys, T.S.O.L., and others, and the extremely catchy Trioxin theme (Trioxin being the name of the chemical). The nicely chosen cast all work incredibly well together, including the under-rated veterans Clu Gulager (as the corporate weasel who cares only for saving his business at first but eventually turns into a real take-charge kind of guy), James Karen (delivering a memorable, delicious comic performance as the warehouse supervisor), and Don Calfa (as the mortician with a possible Nazi past). The younger generation is represented by Linnea Quigley, in her break through role as the kinky Trash, the hilarious Mark Venturini (who unfortunately has also passed on) as Suicide, the spooky guy who just feels misunderstood, Thom Mathews as the ill-fated Freddy, cute Beverly Randolph, sexy Jewel Shepard, and Brian Peck, John Philbin, and Miguel Nunez, all of whom are fun to watch.The makeup effects and gore are excellently done, with some juicy gross 'em out moments.

Yet it is also undeniable that this is classic Exploitation stuff and that every hardcore lover of cult-cinema (such as yours truly) kinda has to see it. Along with Tinto Bras' SALON KITTY (1976), director Don Edmonds' film which was produced by the prolific David F. Friedman (who also produced Hershell Gordon Lewis' early gore films) spawned the Nazisploitation (or Nazi-Exploitation) sub-genre (which practically is a sub-sub-genre of the WIP or Women In Prison movie). These films, mostly from the otherwise best Exploitation country Italy, usually managed to be extremely sleazy and brutal, yet very boring at the same time. ILSA is the undisputed classic of the Nazisploitation genre, and certainly the most memorable film of its kind. Whether that is a recommendation lies in the eye of the beholder. While ILSA (and all the other Nazisploitation films) are strongly against the Nazis who are entirely portrayed as evil, it also trivializes this very sensitive topic, which is of course even more questionable since way more Holocaust-survivors were still alive in the 70s. (Then again, the producer's name is Friedman, and I recently saw a documentary about the popularity of Nazi-porno novels in 70s Israel, so who am I to judge...)The eponymous sadistic female Nazi-villain Ilsa (played by the huge-breasted blonde Dyanne Thorne) is the commander of a Nazi experiment camp. In order to prove that females are better soldiers than men, she conducts gruesome experiments on the female prisoners. She also has sex with the male prisoners, whom she castrates after being disappointed in the can. This changes when the super-potent American prisoner Wolfe is brought to the camp and satisfies her non-stop...Apart from the idea of Nazi-exploitation as such being questionable, ILSA also has a somewhat anti-feminist message Even the man-eating villainous bitch gets tamed when she is properly getting... err... satisfied. The film is incredibly perverted and gruesome, and while the violence is often exaggerated to a ridiculous point and hard to be taken seriously it is yet very disturbing. The female cast members, most of which are naked for the majority of their screen time, are beautiful, but the setting and sadistic violence makes that impossible to enjoy. Without getting into detail, I can say that there are plenty of notoriously gruesome sequences, some of them hard to look at even for experienced exploitation fans, others more ridiculous than truly disturbing.Interestingly, this is a German-American co-production, even though the film was banned in Germany (probably both for the violence and the controversial Nazi-topic). Apart from the countless rip-offs, the movie also spawned two sequels, ILSA HAREM KEEPER OF THE OIL SHEIKS (1976) and ILSA THE TIGRESS OF SIBERIA (1977), as well as the unofficial sort-of-sequel GRETA HAUS OHNE MÄNNER (aka.

Yet it is also undeniable that this is classic Exploitation stuff and that every hardcore lover of cult-cinema (such as yours truly) kinda has to see it. Along with Tinto Bras' SALON KITTY (1976), director Don Edmonds' film which was produced by the prolific David F. Friedman (who also produced Hershell Gordon Lewis' early gore films) spawned the Nazisploitation (or Nazi-Exploitation) sub-genre (which practically is a sub-sub-genre of the WIP or Women In Prison movie). These films, mostly from the otherwise best Exploitation country Italy, usually managed to be extremely sleazy and brutal, yet very boring at the same time. ILSA is the undisputed classic of the Nazisploitation genre, and certainly the most memorable film of its kind. Whether that is a recommendation lies in the eye of the beholder. While ILSA (and all the other Nazisploitation films) are strongly against the Nazis who are entirely portrayed as evil, it also trivializes this very sensitive topic, which is of course even more questionable since way more Holocaust-survivors were still alive in the 70s. (Then again, the producer's name is Friedman, and I recently saw a documentary about the popularity of Nazi-porno novels in 70s Israel, so who am I to judge...)The eponymous sadistic female Nazi-villain Ilsa (played by the huge-breasted blonde Dyanne Thorne) is the commander of a Nazi experiment camp. In order to prove that females are better soldiers than men, she conducts gruesome experiments on the female prisoners. She also has sex with the male prisoners, whom she castrates after being disappointed in the can. This changes when the super-potent American prisoner Wolfe is brought to the camp and satisfies her non-stop...Apart from the idea of Nazi-exploitation as such being questionable, ILSA also has a somewhat anti-feminist message Even the man-eating villainous bitch gets tamed when she is properly getting... err... satisfied. The film is incredibly perverted and gruesome, and while the violence is often exaggerated to a ridiculous point and hard to be taken seriously it is yet very disturbing. The female cast members, most of which are naked for the majority of their screen time, are beautiful, but the setting and sadistic violence makes that impossible to enjoy. Without getting into detail, I can say that there are plenty of notoriously gruesome sequences, some of them hard to look at even for experienced exploitation fans, others more ridiculous than truly disturbing.Interestingly, this is a German-American co-production, even though the film was banned in Germany (probably both for the violence and the controversial Nazi-topic). Apart from the countless rip-offs, the movie also spawned two sequels, ILSA HAREM KEEPER OF THE OIL SHEIKS (1976) and ILSA THE TIGRESS OF SIBERIA (1977), as well as the unofficial sort-of-sequel GRETA HAUS OHNE MÄNNER (aka. ILSA THE WICKED WARDEN, 1977) by the Spanish Exploitation deity Jess Franco.In a nutshell, ILSA is highly questionable and I can understand everybody who finds it despicable to make such a trashy movie about such a sensitive topic. However, it is a must-see for my fellow Exploitation fans (even though nowhere near as essential as other super-notorious classics such as CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST or MARK OF THE DEVIL in my opinion). Definitely not for the easily offended.

It starts off poorly with the title credits lamely played over an almost static shot of the title weapon (very Sledge Hammer) but once we get past the token scene reminding us of Harry's shoot first, ask questions later policing policy, the main plot strand about an internal police death-squad violently taking out known felons dominates the film.There are some humanising touches around Harry's character, although these stereotypically show him as irresistible to women, rebellious to authority and almost friendly and caring for his young black sidekick, so that nothing new is revealed about what makes him tick. There is something condescending about the treatment of these supporting characters, especially the portrayal of Callahan's young Oriental neighbour who despite hardly seeing him around, seems desperate to jump into bed with him.Better to stick with the action of which there is plenty. There's intrigue as Callahan's instincts lead him to find the true identities of the assassination bureau and a good twist as their ringleader emerges from the shadows.The acting is mostly fine, Eastwood naturally dominating in his typical laconic manner. Hal Holbrook is also excellent as his testy superior and David Soul shines in a pre-Hutch role. Ted Post directs with some flair with some blunt lapses while Lalo Schifrin contributes a typically gritty soundtrack. The film makes its main point about the dangers of vigilantism and cleverly uses Harry Callahan of all people as a counterpoint to its proponents.Some might argue as to whether all the violence was necessary and I felt the grisly death of a black prostitute bordered on the gratuitous but on the whole this was superior cop-fare and a good sequel to the trailblazing Dirty Harry.

Whenever I watch an American sitcom or film portraying someone British I find myself on my high horse as hardly anyone speaks in the way they think we do. If we give all Americans this film to watch they will soon realise that England isn't as pretty in pink as they seem to believe. This film is gritty, dark, humorous and filled with all kinds of cockney rhyming slang that Americans would need subtitles. This is the London they all fail to see. The film is about four friends, one of whom Eddy (Moran) is a brilliant card player due to his ability to read people's emotions during a game of cards. Being onto what they believe as a winning deal, the group all pitch in twenty five thousand pound for him to use in an underground card game. Little do they know however that Hatchet Harry, the organiser of the game, doesn't believe in a fair game and cheats his way to taking all Eddy's money and incurring him a five hundred thousand pound debt on top of that. The debt also includes his friends who will all start losing their fingers if they don't repay in seven days. The friends have no idea where to start but manage to overhear their drug dealing neighbours discussing their plan to steal a large amount of money from some incompetent drug dealers. Eddy's plan is to rob these guys once they have robbed the other guys. Meanwhile two antique shotguns have just been priced at three hundred thousand pounds and Hatchet Harry sends two scouse lads in to steal them. Miscommunication construes and Eddy and the gang end up with five hundred thousand pounds worth of cash and two antique shotguns. Breathing down their neck are also the neighbours, the incompetent drug dealers and their dangerous boss, Hatchet Harry and his cronies and Big Chris (Vinnie Jones) who 'collects' for Harry. The film plays out with lots of interweaving plot lines and several twists and turns all filled with irony. Each twist and turn ends up with someone not realising just what they have a hold of. For example the group find themselves in possessions of the guns which would solve all their problems but they have no idea that these guns are actually of some value. Also the two scouse lads tracking down the guns don't realise they are actually hunting down the person they robbed them for in the first place. The plot is completely confusing and will make no sense in writing but to watch it you will see exactly what I mean.The script is fantastic, all the dialogue is realistic and well thought out and the majority of the acting is spot on, especially from Moran, Flemyng, Fletcher and Statham. The opening five minutes set it all up with an Only Fools and Horses style selling technique. Bacon (Statham) is attempting to flog some dodgy jewellery before being chased by the police. The dialogue and acting in this sequence sets us up for the acts to follow and really creates the world that we will be living in for the next two hours. Bravo Mr Ritchie a compelling script you have bought to our attention. One scene that is brilliant is when the neighbours are locked in a cage during the robbery and are being shot at with an air rifle. The whole sequence is fantastic.However the film does have its downfalls. At times there are just too many characters and people are introduced and then disappear for long periods before returning and others show up so late you wander why they were bothered with in the first place. In the end it does all come together but throughout the overuse of characters sometimes makes the plot seem a little disjointed.I personally think this is a very good film but it has to be your cup of tea otherwise you won't enjoy it. It is one of Guy Ritchie's best films but certainly not his best, Snatch gets that award hands down. I believe that if I was reviewing this film in 1998 then I would be more impressed but as I am viewing it after I've seen Snatch particularly, I can't rate it quite as highly. It is a good film but I suggest you watch it before Snatch. That way you will be treated to a very good film followed by a great one.

And maybe on its release date it might have had some appeal, saying something like let's kick some Nazi asses. It is an attempt at being glamorous as well; ill-faded completely nevertheless. Besides that, very little to offer with the pathetic Here's is looking at you, kid.The last sequence, the airplane one, sums it up.Poor acting, poor Drama, cheesy carton airplane to end up an excuse of a classic. People are afraid of actually watching it and being critical, thus regarded as ignorant film-wise and hence the many 10 out of 10 reviews. It's easier to go with the flow ! with the bunch.

It's a familiar saying but the question that goes along with it is...how? Fight it with love, or fight it with violence? It's an age old question that is as relevant today as in any other time period. It's the question Spike Lee's masterpiece, Do the Right Thing, tackles boldly, albeit harshly. Do the Right Thing takes place on a swelter summer day in a primarily black neighborhood in Brooklyn. The day begins peaceful enough, but tensions flare and tempers rise as the day gets hotter and more uncomfortable. The film presents a colorful clash of characters that move through a series of seemingly trivial matters throughout the day, all building towards the violent boiling point where the racial tension shatters and chaos erupts. It's a visually electric film with a story so ingeniously woven, full of characters so beautifully crafted. This film has changed the face of racial tension in film by being overtly powerful and shockingly compelling.This isn't a film that demonizes one particular side of the race war. It doesn't take a side and it tells its story from multiple perspectives. It digs down deep into the tension and examines a close group of characters to the fullest extent. It may seem like the white people in this film are the villains, those who cause all the problems and all the trouble, but when compared to the black people in the film we learn that we're all cut from the same flawed and troubled cloth. Nobody is all good, but nobody is all bad either. Do the Right Thing levels the playing field and aims to give the world a reality check. It's not all black and white out there, and the film throws this in our face, even in the way the film is designed with its bright neon colors that contrast with one another and make everything in this backwards Brooklyn neighborhood pop out. Here's a film that displays multi leveled storytelling at its finest, never faltering and getting its point across very well.The great thing about this film is that it doesn't preach to us even thought it has such a strong message. It has action, it has excitement, it has an eloquently human side to it that makes it all the more compelling. Do the Right Thing is an illustrious film with lots of bells and whistles in the form of quirky characters and wild situations. The incredible thing about this film, however, is how it pulls all of these quirks and nuances together to paint its bigger picture. There is all kinds of symbolism here that Lee employs through his stylistic camera work and his moody and powerful script. Do the Right Thing is a film that works on so many levels, and I plan on seeing it multiple times so as to collect all of the brilliance it has to offer. This is an incredibly well made, incredibly important film that is an absolute must see.

I believe I was around seven years old when I first watched Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Ever since that first viewing, I have been in love with the film and its incredible diegesis. Though the film all together is a wonderful timeless piece, for the purpose of my review I want to start when the winners of the golden tickets enter the factory with their parents. As they travel along the many rooms, corridors, tunnels, and halls of the factory, the viewer learns more about each individual child and, more importantly, what is characteristically wrong with them and their parents. Though Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory captures the viewer through Gene Wilder's quirky character and the sensory delightfulness of the factory, one of the most important things the viewer takes away from this film are morals. More specifically, to be polite, selfless, kind, respectful&#x85; everything that our parents are suppose to teach us and are deemed desirable by society. What makes this message so universal is the fact that not only is it meant for children but adults as well. The viewer learns these lessons from all of the children as well as their parents, who are partly if not entirely to blame for their behavior. The first child to be taken away is Augustus Gloop, a fat little boy who falls into the chocolate river. Even though Willy Wonka tells Augustus to stay away from the river, the boy is disobedient and even falls in and gets sucked up into a pipe. His fault is gluttony. Three other children all share similar fates, all representing an imperfection in society. The second child, Veruca Salt, is terribly spoiled by her father and demands to have one of the golden egg laying geese inside the factory. She attempts to get one and is deemed a bad egg and sent down a chute, followed by her father. She is, of course, greed. The two other children personify stubbornness and rudeness and are both punished for it; one by becoming a human blueberry, the other, turned into a micro-sized version of himself. The protagonist of the film, Charlie, is the only child left at the end of the factory tour. However, since he is only human, him and his grandfather (the only respectable parental figure besides, perhaps, Wonka himself) drink a fizzy soda that makes the both of them float up to the ceiling. Unlike the other participants, their predicament is only temporary. Even so, Willy Wonka is displeased with them and tells them to leave. Being obedient, regretful, and respectful, they exit the factory. Only through their act of humility does Wonka present them with the ultimate prize, the factory itself. This sends an obvious message to the viewer of what attributes are right and which ones are wrong.It was only recently that I realized Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was made in 1971. I knew it was an old movie, but I was shocked to find out it is over forty years old. Once the characters enter the factory, time seems to stop. There is nothing dated in the factory, save for the television, and the characters themselves don't necessarily give away a time period. These elements, along with the very universal message the film is sending, make it sincerely timeless. People in twenty years from today can watch this movie and still take away from it, young and old.

That being said, however, I do believe that I enjoyed this movie because of the extreme levels of strangeness and awkwardness associated with the plot and characters. As the movie starts we immediately jump into Dustin Hoffman's (at first) unwanted affair with Anne Bancroft, and this sort of sets the tone for the rest of the film. It is very humorous watching Hoffman fumble around as he attempts to entertain this older and clearly more experienced woman, and the movie is clearly a comedy. But then something happens- Mrs. Bancroft's daughter enters the story and I felt the movie sort of shift and lose sight of its original plot. Perhaps this was done purposefully, but I feel that once Hoffman meets Bancroft's daughter it turns almost into a drama. The movie still maintains its humor but I think we see a clear change in the tone from jovial boyhood antics to someone who suddenly decides they want to grow up and get married out of nowhere. I don't think this detracts from the film, but I feel that Hoffman's character changes gears so suddenly the viewer may not be ready for it. Still a great film however, and I would highly recommend anyone to see it. There were some interesting camera tricks during the early stages of the film when Hoffman and Bancroft start their affair, as we see almost a montage of sorts depicting Hoffman running back and forth between his parents house and the hotel rooms he frequents with Mrs. Bancroft, illustrating his shame in a way. Also, there are some cool underwater shots in the pool scene(s) and I think they were very imaginative for the time. It felt fresh to me and I thoroughly enjoyed it the whole way through.
