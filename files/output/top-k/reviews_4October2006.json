What's it about? people ask me as they trawl through my shelf of movies, looking for something to while away a Saturday evening.Well, er, um, there's this girl and her boyfriend's a low-level gang punk and he needs a lot of money and she tries to get it for him. Three times. With differing results each time. And it's in German.Oh, you've got 'The Island'. Can I borrow that instead?None of my friends want to borrow this movie and that's fair enough. I can't argue the case for Lola Rennt because the film doesn't have a conventional story, parts of it are like a manic pop video and it's German. But I still like it. A luminous Franka Potente and fine supporting cast put human faces on the surreal scribbles of Tom Tykwer's screenplay and the film fizzes with energy.Anyway, your local Blockbuster has at least 30 copies of The Island available at any one time. Finding a copy of Lola Rennt to watch would be more of a challenge...
