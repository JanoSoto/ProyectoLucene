The comics weren't in the best condition, a tear here and there, but they still held up pretty well. Being a slightly big comic book fan at the time (even bigger now) I took a peak at these weird looking comics. Well, I immediately found something special in these comics. Maybe it was the nudity, the drugs or the swears, but I was obsessed with these two comics for quite some time. The two comics were Zap #0 and Mr. Natural #2. I remember on the back of the Zapped comic there was directions on how to smoke a joint or a muggle. Great directions by the way. Ever since I found these two gems, I've become a fan of R. Crumb's work. The first time I saw Crumb the movie, I suppose I was a tad too young to grip what was going on. Thankfully my brother bought me the DVD this past Xmas. I've put if off for a while now, but I put it in last night, and I was immediately brought back to that same type of infatuation with drawing. But something I didn't pick up on the first viewing was all the emotion this documentary delivered. Crumb is a documentary that covers almost all bases of his life. From his tough childhood all the way up to the present as rich and famous artist. If you ever wanted to know who R. Crumb is or how he acts, or what he thinks, this is a must see movie. The film also focuses on Robert's family. Be it his ex-girlfriend, ex-wife or his mother and brothers. When they show up at his mother's house where his brother Charles still lives, the movie takes on a different feel. The scene with Robert, Charles and his mother in the living room is classic stuff. The scenes with Charles are incredibly funny yet pretty damn sad. If you ask me, a movie based on the life of Charles would have been just as good as this. For the reason, Charles might have been a better artist than Robert when he decided to stop drawing. By the end of Crumb, I immediately put on the special features, which unfortunately is only a commentary, but a great commentary nonetheless with the director and Roger Ebert. I usually just check back at the special features down the road sometime, but with this film I had to watch it immediately....even at 230 am. If you're a fan of art, R. Crumb or just a fan of well-made documentaries there's no reason you shouldn't enjoy the hell out of this film. It's definitely one of the best documentaries on a person I've ever seen. 9.5 outta 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"25 March 2007","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Mr. Natural Don't Mean Sheeit...One day while searching through my father's closet (about 12 years ago) I happened to come across a couple of comic books.

I am aware that every film may rise some controversial feelings due to its shortcomings or misinterpretations, but so strong ones are rather rare?... When WINDTALKERS was released in theaters a few years ago, I did not feel a special need to see this movie because of its upsetting war theme. Although I have nothing against these films, they despair me in a way. Most of the history is still quite fresh and its drama is so intense that I simply don't feel good after watching the movies of this genre (with a few exceptions). However, recently I have hired a DVD and saw the entire film having been recommended by my friend. Although its action takes place in the heyday of WWII, it is a slightly different movie than most of the rest. There are historical facts about Americans on the Japanese island of Saipan during WWII but, foremost, our attention is drawn to characters of MARINES among whom there are two Navajo Indians. What are their psyches, their thoughts, their behavior in the hell that war supplied them with? Two characters are ever present Sergeant Joe Enders (Nicholas Cage) and a Navajo Indian Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach). Although they meet in very strange circumstances, they become friends in time. Joe has the task to protect the code in Navajo language; yet, he himself wonders how much else, in time, appears to be under his protection... Joe is a hero, a real soldier, a particularly noble character. I feel a need to say that people who criticize his part are wrong. His part is an advantage of the movie. If there is a problem, it lies somewhere else. Ben Yahzee is a warrior but also a family man. Yet, we do not get much insight into Indian culture except for some minor moments about beliefs and ghosts. Pete Henderson (Christian Slater) is an interesting character, firstly unwilling to cooperate with code talkers, then, however, finding a true friendship with the Indian, Whitehorse (Roger Willie). When concerning the male characters, there is a brilliant moment of their talk about longing for families and peace of mind. The problem with characters, however, lies in Rita (Frances O'Connor) the woman Joe loves, someone who appears to be the representation of all precious values that Joe heads for in his life. Her part is well introduced but very badly executed later...I also found the action of the movie quite thrilling. It did keep my attention, sometimes the fighting scenes are deadly too long and unrealistic, but they are not that weak in general. I liked the first half of the movie when you watch and wait what will happen next. But the second half is also not tedious whatsoever. All the moments are pretty balanced and events well executed. Touching scenes, for instance, supply the movie with a feeling so that we can stop for a while and think. You think too much that is what war forbids, however, that is what this movie does allow and even does promote, particularly in the final 10 minutes - that was the climax for me which really shocked me and moved me and that is the aspect I consider a strong side of WINDTALKERS.The performances are not the best for sure. However, I cannot say I didn't like most of the cast. Cage does a pretty good job as Enders. There isn't, perhaps, a charisma in his performance but it's at least to say GOOD. I would agree that too much emphasis is put on his part but I wouldn't say that his plot is useless. Adam Beach, although sometimes pale, gives pretty fine performance as Yahzee. When you watch the movie carefully, you will find some pearls in his part where he really fits to the role. I loved Frances OConnor as Rita, she is brilliant and it is a pity she was given so little time on screen. As I have already said, her character should have been developed more! Christian Slater is strange as in most of his roles (I am not his particular fan), but not bad. All in all, there are some shortcomings in the performances - that aspect really lowers the value of WINDTALKERS as a movie in general.But if there is a talk of any problem, it lies in the lack of Navajo culture development - wind talkers, code protectors...and what at the end. I cannot spoil your curiosity because you would not see the film with enthusiasm but the title and the gist seems to be lost somewhere. The film is anti-war, it shows its lack of humanity and logic, but it could have been more powerful if executed as a real masterpiece. There had been an idea for sure which was lost somewhere in the middle. A few scenes more would help this and solve the problem partly, more focus on Navajo. To be absolutely honest about this movie, it is in no way a dull film, an upsetting picture that too viewers can stand. It has some really powerful moments, has nice shots and foremost the two factors I have mentioned action and good insight into young men's psyches whose only duty was to shoot to kill until being killed. Indeed, WINDTALKERS is another anti-war film filled with nice thoughts and reflections. Therefore, accusing this as one of the worst films ever is a misunderstanding and baseless criticism. It lacks something here or there, that's all. Worth seeing as a picture which once again shouts out NO MORE WAR! A movie to be seen objectively, which will make you realize it's quite worth a search.

Sure, Giulietta Masina did a fine job--she was a fine actress (as well as Fellini's wife), but this doesn't make the movie. The problem is that the movie is so unrelentingly realistic and grim. Sure, in real life prostitutes don't find love and are often abused--but do I really have to see this movie to know this?! The film starts with Masina getting beaten up and nearly killed by her boyfriend and the film ends much the same way.

Theresa Russell portrays Liz as bluntly honest, no-nonsense about her job and what comes with the territory of being a hooker. She seems a bit uneducated and a tad obnoxious, but, at the same time, you can't take your eyes of her because you never know what is about to come spewing out.

My mum was watching The Last Waltz on A&E, as I recall, and she made us watch it with her, saying, OK, you kids want to be musicians, then you need to see this! We had no idea who any of these performers were...hell, to us Bob Dylan at that time was just the guy who'd smoked up The Beatles! Well, I was impressed then, even though it took me about another ten years or so to get into The Band, Dylan, Neil Young, etc (all of whom are among my favourite artists today.) The Last Waltz is, of course, Martin Scorsese's documentary of The Band's final concert, at Winterland in San Fran, on Thanksgiving 1976. After sixteen years of being on the road, with all the hard living and extra baggage that that entails, they'd decided to pack it in (or at least Robbie Robertson had, as history has shown.) And they decided to go out with a bang, inviting practically all of their musical associates to join them Dylan, Young, Eric Clapton, Joni Mitchell, Ronnie Hawkins (who had, after all, given them their first big break years and years before), Van Morrison, Muddy Waters and even Neil Diamond, to name a few. Probably the greatest pre-Live Aid gathering ever on one stage. So you can be guaranteed that music will be top notch; aside from The Band's own classics (The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down; The Shape I'm In; Ophelia; It Makes No Difference...even a new studio-shot version of The Weight featuring The Staples Singers) you get Dylan doing Forever Young, Neil Young's Helpless, Joni Mitchell's Coyote, Van The Man's Caravan...a veritable 70's California rock wet dream.Ah yes...the seventies...as timeless as the majority of the music performed at The Last Waltz is, practically everything else about it just screams 1976. Especially the costumes lots of bellbottoms, butterfly collars and plaid on display. Richard Manuel, The Band's pianist (R.I.P.), and Don Cherry must have the same tailor, what with their taste for tacky suits. Along with the 70's clothes is the 70's cocaine, with which this concert just reeks of (I practically get a coke buzz just watching it, and I detest cocaine!). Apparently Scorsese and Robertson spent quite a bit of their own money just to rotoscope a big chunk of blow hanging from Neil Young's nose. To their credit, as high as EVERYBODY involved seems to be, the performances are great (even if, according to Levon Helm, The Band's drummer, a lot of post-production overdubs took place...I've heard the bootleg of the actual concert and you really can't tell.) For what makes The Last Waltz so special is how well The Band meshed and their onstage interaction. Here were five guys who were utterly simpatico with one another musically...if there is a such thing as musical mindreading, these guys could do it (which explains how they could back up Bob Dylan so well). In my opinion, the only other band that comes close to this kind of interaction is Led Zeppelin...and arguably The Band pulled it off better. The sum indeed made up more than the parts, which makes the Helm-led 80's reunions such a letdown.Having said that, the biggest drawback to The Last Waltz is how it is more or less presented as The Robbie Robertson Show. Sure, Robbie's a hell of a songwriter and guitarist, but it cracks me up to no end watching him sing into that unplugged microphone ('cos the man can't really sing...at least not compared to Manuel, Helm or Rick Danko, whose performance of It Makes No Difference is, for me, the song of the night). Robertson gets the most camera time, both onstage and during the interviews, though the other four guys have their share of insights as well during Scorsese's interviews (even if Danko is stoned silly and Manuel is hammered.) Still, The Last Waltz is Robbie's trip just like Let It Be is Paul McCartney's show.Still, all told, The Last Waltz -and The Band in general- is really musician's music, and deservedly so. Heh heh...one of my exes, who is not musically minded, watched The Last Waltz with me once and couldn't understand all the fuss (she complained a lot of the music was too slow.) Are you nuts?! I said...we broke up not long after, actually. I still make it a point to watch this film at least four or five times a year, and always ask myself, What the hell has happened to popular music since then?...my musical era, with only a handful of exceptions, ends at about 1980...I have no tolerance for nowadays greed-motivated pop CRAP. Artists like The Band epitomize artistic integrity, which seems to be as dead as John Lennon these days.By the way...the fact that The Last Waltz was directed by Martin Scorsese, probably the greatest filmmaker of modern times, is just a great big bonus!

","genre":"Documentary, Music"},{"date":"25 March 2007","score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" This is Kurosawa's best known and most beloved film, and rightly so. Seven Samurai has been called the first modern action movie. That's a matter perhaps more of definitions than anything else, but whatever the case this is certainly a film in which literally physical action is important. Kurosawa's use of movement, always an important element in his pictures, is here brought to perfection. Actors pop in and out of the frame, dynamic edits are used for emphasis, and scenes often begin with a burst of action. For Kurosawa this type of construction is not just about creating an exhilarating action picture; the movement is also symbolic of life, vitality and irrepressibility and this is central to the picture.Kurosawa constantly dealt with the conflict between an individual's true value and the constraints of their social status. One of his greatest achievements is revealing the humanity in the most unassuming of people. In Ikiru (1952) Kurosawa had done this as a single character study, turning a middle-aged fuddy-duddy into a hero, but Seven Samurai is an even fuller statement of the notion. First off we have peasants who refuse to accept nasty, brutish and short lives. Then we have the Samurai. Jobless ronin, already considered the scum of feudal Japan, who accept the ultimate humiliation in being employed by peasants rather than a lord. Both peasants and Samurai are changed by their experiences, and shown to be greater people for it. And at the centre of this humanist theme is Kikuchiyo &#150; a man of peasant stock who pretends to be a Samurai. Nothing can change the lowlyness of his birth, but he becomes one of the seven by the way he acts. It's also worth remembering that Kurosawa was a maverick in Japanese cinema, and if he was pointing the finger of one hand at social ills, he was generally pointing the finger of the other hand at his contemporaries in the industry. Just as Seven Samurai tears into Japanese conventions of hierarchy and duty, it also attacks the romanticised, portrayal of feudal loyalty and honour that ran through the Samurai genre. By the way, some knowledge of Japanese culture is helpful in understanding the significance of all this, particularly the status of the jobless Samurai, but it is not a necessity to enjoy the film.In the way that his goal is to humanise his characters, Kurosawa is much like his idol John Ford, and Seven Samurai in fact shares a lot of ground with Ford's Stagecoach. What really strikes me about Seven Samurai however is the depth of characterisation. It is typical in Japanese cinema for there to be around ten central characters, as opposed to three or four in the average western film. But these characters are not simply pieces in a jigsaw puzzle &#150; each has their own issues and their own journey to go on. Kurosawa takes his time in introducing the Samurai characters, with each getting their own very memorable first scene. The four or five peasant characters that we get to know are no less well-rounded and complex, but the way they are presented to us is very different. They instead gradually emerge from the mass of identical looking farmers. By the end we have as much respect for Rikichi and Yohei as we do for Kambei and Kyuzo.There really is no single weak link in Seven Samurai. There is another great musical score Fumio Hayasaka, which manages to capture the diversity of tones in Kurosawa's narrative. The acting performances are all good, and the casting is spot on. Toshiro Mifune really gets to show off the breadth of his range. At times he is snarling beast like in Rashomon, but he later displays a deep humanity, ranting emphatically, making children laugh and breaking down in tears on more than one occasion. It's clear though that it was Kurosawa who really brought out the best in Mifune if you compare this to his performances in, for example, Hiroshi Inagaki's Samurai Trilogy (made around the same time), which are merely adequate.I'd also like to briefly mention my favourite scene. It's the one where the peasants who live outside the village try to split from the program because their houses will be lost, and the Samurai stop them. It's the very heart of the film for me. Firstly, it explains the importance of working together. It also shows for the first time how the peasants have changed in comparison to those opening scenes. They have gone from a frightened rabble to being confident and organised. The final seconds of this scene are absolutely incredible in their framing and timing &#150; we see the peasants standing proudly in line, the music swells up, Kikuchiyo straightens out the one crooked spear, the music reaches a climax, a gust of wind blows across the scene&#133; and fade out. Brilliant.Seven Samurai is a classic because it is one of the fullest, roundest and deepest films ever made. It is one of the few films that scores on every level &#150; excitement, emotion, storytelling and sheer technical quality. It's a great achievement in itself to produce a three-hour plus film that is endlessly watchable and never dull. It represents the first peak in Kurosawa's career, and a high point for cinema as a whole.

Kurosawa takes his time in introducing the Samurai characters, with each getting their own very memorable first scene. The four or five peasant characters that we get to know are no less well-rounded and complex, but the way they are presented to us is very different. They instead gradually emerge from the mass of identical looking farmers. By the end we have as much respect for Rikichi and Yohei as we do for Kambei and Kyuzo.There really is no single weak link in Seven Samurai. There is another great musical score Fumio Hayasaka, which manages to capture the diversity of tones in Kurosawa's narrative. The acting performances are all good, and the casting is spot on. Toshiro Mifune really gets to show off the breadth of his range. At times he is snarling beast like in Rashomon, but he later displays a deep humanity, ranting emphatically, making children laugh and breaking down in tears on more than one occasion. It's clear though that it was Kurosawa who really brought out the best in Mifune if you compare this to his performances in, for example, Hiroshi Inagaki's Samurai Trilogy (made around the same time), which are merely adequate.I'd also like to briefly mention my favourite scene. It's the one where the peasants who live outside the village try to split from the program because their houses will be lost, and the Samurai stop them. It's the very heart of the film for me. Firstly, it explains the importance of working together. It also shows for the first time how the peasants have changed in comparison to those opening scenes. They have gone from a frightened rabble to being confident and organised. The final seconds of this scene are absolutely incredible in their framing and timing &#150; we see the peasants standing proudly in line, the music swells up, Kikuchiyo straightens out the one crooked spear, the music reaches a climax, a gust of wind blows across the scene&#133; and fade out. Brilliant.Seven Samurai is a classic because it is one of the fullest, roundest and deepest films ever made. It is one of the few films that scores on every level &#150; excitement, emotion, storytelling and sheer technical quality. It's a great achievement in itself to produce a three-hour plus film that is endlessly watchable and never dull. It represents the first peak in Kurosawa's career, and a high point for cinema as a whole.

But, against the odds, it succeeds beautifully, probably because all of the scenes in the film are pitch perfect - a perfect balance of humor, action and science fiction fancy; Nimoy learned his lessons well in the 3rd Trek film. Again, on the surface, the story seems to be a simple union of the overused time travel angle coupled with an environmental message. But, because the messengers are the seven well-known characters of the Trek canon, all here given a chance to shine as never before, there's much more enjoyment to be found throughout than we could have ever expected. All the actors had been in these roles for many years by this point and they each knew how to make the most of it, including the ones playing Scotty, Sulu, Chekov and Uhura, usually relegated to one-note scenes regarding ship's functions. Here, they get to fully participate in a grand Trek adventure, full partners with the main trio of Kirk, Spock and McCoy. Oh, and, besides returning Spock's father, Sarek, they even let Spock's mother return briefly - talk about grand reunions (see Journey to Babel).The only thing missing, of course, is the Enterprise - our Trekking castaways get around in a commandeered Klingon 'Bird of Prey' ship here. Things begin with a huge mysterious probe, approaching Earth and knocking out all power as it sends a signal into the oceans, requiring an answer. I had some misgivings when I first saw this in the theaters back in '86 - it seemed too similar to the first Trek film (shades of V'Ger!) and did not bode well. But, luckily, the story veers to a different tack after this first act our heroes are on their way back to Earth as well, ready to answer charges for breaking several Starfleet rules and regs in the previous film. Suddenly, this turns out to be the least of their problems as they're placed in the position of saving their planet once again. Instead of attacking the probe head-on, which would probably be a useless attempt, they deduce that their best option is to travel back to Earth's 20th century. And the audience is along for the ride, watching these greats work their magic, watching them solve all manner of dilemmas and accompanying these legends on their tour of present-day San Francisco. It's wish fulfillment, it's a crowd-pleaser, it's high concept done with a wink and a cheer.Some might argue that this retreads familiar ground, the original time travel episodes Tomorrow is Yesterday and AssignmentEarth, but all the scenes in our present time work great. My personal favorite is Scotty & McCoy meeting with a Plexiglas manufacturer and their introduction to him of transparent aluminum. It's directed perfectly, with Scotty at first appearing out of place but soon showing he was in control of the situation the whole time - it may be Doohan's finest moment in the Trek film series. Running a close second is Chekov's interrogation scene; it should have been stupid but, somehow, Nimoy and Koenig made it hysterical. There are numerous others - Kirk's bit with his eyeglasses, Spock's conversation with the whales, his struggle with present-day profanity in speech - it's all smoothly integrated into the overall playful adventure. We even encounter some genuine suspense in the race against time near the climax. Yes, maybe it is a bit all lightweight in the end but as the concluding chapter of a trilogy, it gave us the satisfaction of tying things up neatly - with Spock and his father, with the fate of our beloved crew and the promise of yet another new beginning. But, uh-oh, next was The Final Frontier.
