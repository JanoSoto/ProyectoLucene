If anything, I probably remember reading the actual play more, or maybe when they tried to do the comparison with Zeferelli's far superior 1968 version. Bored one day (very bored, though sadly not with the wherewithal to pick up a book like a more sane person), I saw Romeo + Juliet was on cable and stayed tuned to watch it. It's not as bad I've heard from some, which is that it's one of the worst films ever made. It's somehow weirdly watchable in some instances and shots and moments. Baz Lurhmann isn't a hack, that much is completely certain, he's got too much verve and POP in his style to be easily ignored. This is in fact what made Moulin Rouge, for better or worse, the significant achievement it was. But all the technical razzle dazzle in this case can't cover up the biggest problem of all casting.And I don't mean that in the sense of oh, casting these hot young people of the 90s like Di Caprio and Claire Danes and, uh, John Leguizamo I guess, that notion is a given. Watching the film today, after years of knowing Romeo & Juliet and Shakespeare work in general, the actors with one or two exceptions can't pull off the performances. Lurhmann leaves these kids and other character players like Harold Pirenneau and even a strange walk-on like Paul Sorvino to fend for themselves. And as for the two stars, Di Caprio and Danes, they are pretty to look at, but the performances clearly don't have a kind of focus that's required with the material. Perhaps this is more than anything not so much a fault of the director's in that oh, I'll cast them for this look and that, but of simple things like rehearsal. I can imagine Lurhmann taking so much time to prepare how to make Verona the Verona-on-speed of his world, the Capulets and Montagues in their power games and battles, all super-designed and made out in super 90s sheek with some 80s leftover.So in short, there is a vision here, but its squandered when the human elements are left beside. Some bits are worthwhile, like Pete Posthlethwaie (sic) s the priest, but really the main attraction is to try and lure in mall kids who wouldn't go near the Bard with a ten foot pair of designer jeans under normal circumstances. It's shiny and goes fast and crazy, but there's not a lot of substance much... at all. That being said, it's fun to re-live some of the 90s music, as cheesy as it can get.

With this film, Waters delivers yet more bad taste and trashiness; although it's slightly higher quality than the earlier film was and the plot has some extra depth. I think a viewer's opinion on John Waters will largely depend on what exactly they want from movies and thus this is not a film for everyone...and it didn't do much for me. The lead character is Dawn Davenport, a spoilt schoolgirl that wants a pair of cha-cha heels from her parents for Christmas. She doesn't get what she wants, so the brat decides to run away from home, ends up having an illegitimate child and gets involved with a couple of photographers that like to photograph women during acts of crime because that, apparently, is sexy. Davenport eventually makes something of a name for herself; but her fame comes at a price and she ends up on the run from the cops.This film does have more depth than Pink Flamingos; but it's still all about style. No matter what you think of the film itself, you have to take your hat off to Waters for the style of the film, which is completely bizarre and unique. The set design and costumes are completely over the top and this compliments the absurd and disgusting humour well. It's obvious that this film was made on a very low budget; and Waters clearly couldn't afford any good actors. The film does benefit from the presence of Divine, however; the trashy transvestite who delivers another unforgettable performance as Waters' leading 'lady'. The film takes a turn for the surreal on several occasions and Waters adds in plenty of social satire; some of which works (but most of which doesn't go anywhere). The film doesn't pull any punches, and although it is less disgusting than the earlier effort; there's still plenty to make the audience vomit. The structure of the film holds it together well until the ending and Waters does at least tell a story. Anyone that enjoys this sort of stuff will no doubt be in heaven with this trash-fest...but I doubt I'll ever see it again.

Beside that, it has many things other (and especially modern) movies don't have original story (some people call it stupid - seriously, I don't know why. perhaps they're too serious? well, serious people don't waste their time on movies and other insubstantial things); character charisma - you can't help but sympathize with the protagonists you see on screen - almost every one of them is a living individual, not a that third guy from the left - especially that cynical, sarcastic duck; nice music that is played throughout the movie; decent acting (excellent acting if compared to modern movies); good decorations; nice and very colourful visuals. By the way, this movie won Razzie award for worst visual effects. Hm, if they only knew back in 1990 what visuals we'd have in 21 century... I've seen those modern, cheap, square special effects in Terminator 3 or LotR, and believe me - they were WORST. So why did T3, LotR, RE 2&3 etc. not win any of those humiliating awards? I guess because critics were much softer on them (being representatives of new movie viewer generation that loves pointless all action movies like Matrix with square visuals and minimum of REAL decorations). What many modern movie makers don't realize is that special effects cannot replace real decorations, and only with decorations being the basics of the view visuals can do some nice job, too. My dreams look more realistic and colourful than the background generated by computers in the movies. Anyway, one can easily explain why decorations are being less used nowadays - they cost millions and require some talents, while special effects cost nothing, take much less time and require someone who has never left his apartment.Now, let's talk about stupid movie stories - have you watched Batman Begins or The Dark Knight? Execellent movies, you say? Well, make me and yourselves a favour - forget that it's about Batman, forget that the budget was big (or not). Just watch them as if they were independent movies. Can you see through the mist of delusion now? Infantile in its stupidity story, poor acting (actors were disgusted about what they were doing so much they weren't able to show any emotions), histrionic dialogs that never make sense, stupid actions that lack rationalism and logic (like why the hell are you shooting with two handguns? buy UZI, you mendicant!), average music score, artificiality. I don't know what many people find so fine about last Batmans. Boring movies, with characters having no individuality they come, they die. who were they? who cares? let's watch those big explosions and stupid matrix-like fights that make no sense!.What I'm trying to say here is that as some movies are unjustifiably underrated (Lynch's Dune, for example), some are unjustifiably overrated. Regular viewers don't do the ratings - movie critics do. Bad thing is, many regular viewers fall for it and repeat after them, thus pushing one star button, thinking it's their honest opinion. Those critics are also individuals, with their own taste and desires. And instead of bashing movies like Howard the Duck only because its badness is a popular belief you'd better watch this movie independently of any alien opinion and decide for yourselves if you liked it or not. And I'm sure, everyone who HAS seen this movie had found something he\/she liked in it.All in all, I give Howard the Duck 10 stars (by modern standards, for I haven't seen a decent American movie for a few years now) for its originality, humour, acting, music scores, decorations, visuals, and most importantly - for being alive. Of course, this movie does have some bad moments, like some scenes I personally would have cut out, but still, they don't ruin the film's inner charm.

Infantile in its stupidity story, poor acting (actors were disgusted about what they were doing so much they weren't able to show any emotions), histrionic dialogs that never make sense, stupid actions that lack rationalism and logic (like why the hell are you shooting with two handguns? buy UZI, you mendicant!), average music score, artificiality. I don't know what many people find so fine about last Batmans. Boring movies, with characters having no individuality they come, they die. who were they? who cares? let's watch those big explosions and stupid matrix-like fights that make no sense!.What I'm trying to say here is that as some movies are unjustifiably underrated (Lynch's Dune, for example), some are unjustifiably overrated. Regular viewers don't do the ratings - movie critics do. Bad thing is, many regular viewers fall for it and repeat after them, thus pushing one star button, thinking it's their honest opinion. Those critics are also individuals, with their own taste and desires. And instead of bashing movies like Howard the Duck only because its badness is a popular belief you'd better watch this movie independently of any alien opinion and decide for yourselves if you liked it or not. And I'm sure, everyone who HAS seen this movie had found something he\/she liked in it.All in all, I give Howard the Duck 10 stars (by modern standards, for I haven't seen a decent American movie for a few years now) for its originality, humour, acting, music scores, decorations, visuals, and most importantly - for being alive. Of course, this movie does have some bad moments, like some scenes I personally would have cut out, but still, they don't ruin the film's inner charm.

If there was anything Kubrick was a master at, it was the ability to adapt novels to films. Here, it is never more apparent. Though I have never read the book, and though I know the film is quite different than the novel, I found this to be an absolutely engrossing picture that completely grabs you in and takes you on this disturbing and provocative journey. Yet even despite all the editing and contracting Kubrick had to do in order for this to pass the censors, I believe it only enhances the experience of watching this man as he continues down a path that can only lead to certain unhappiness and moral obscurity.For all the controversy and trouble that came with this picture, the actors certainly did their share. James Mason does something almost uncanny with this character of Humbert Humbert, a man so slimy and paranoid, there is no reason to like him; yet Mason is able to get us to almost sympathize for this man. Shelley Winters is magnificent here as the promiscuous widow who is set for tragedy. Peter Sellers is comical, as always, but Sue Lyons really surprised me with her ability to give a rather open performance of this girl who very much had psychological problems. Of course, with Kubrick behind the camera, the look and feel of the film is sly, subversive, and completely enhancing.

How else could you explain anyone giving this film a 10 or even scores of 9 and 8? Other than to provide unintended laughs, I just can't see the Billy Jack films as capable of earning anything close to these very respectable scores--even this one, which is probably the best in the series.This film starts on a very, very poor note. Instead of storytelling, there is a long exposition by Pat O'Brien as he explains much of the setting for the film--and it's way too much! This long diatribe about the evils of nuclear weapons and nuclear power just seemed like sloppy film making-- like a political speech instead of a proper prologue. In addition, why not have the characters talk about this in the film itself? Having this prologue just seemed like they forgot to film these scenes and instead chose to sum it all up this way!As for the rest of the film, it sure showed a lot of hubris for director\/actor Tom Laughlin to consider remaking the Jimmy Stewart-Frank Capra classic film (currently #101 on IMDb's top 250). In this version, however, instead of appointing Jefferson Smith to the Senate (a beloved icon of children across America), the powers that be decide to appoint a man with a long history of manslaughter and possibly justifiable homicides!! I certainly remember Mr. Jack dispensing a lot of mayhem in his previous films THE BORN LOSERS, BILLY JACK and THE TRIAL OF BILLY JACK! Apparently the grafters do not remember nor do they read the newspapers, and so they decided to appoint an ex-con who is famous for fighting the man. That sure makes sense!! What's next--appointing a member of the Manson family or a rabid dog or a tomato?! What was likable about this silly film? Well, it was finally nice to see Delores Taylor (Laughlin's wife and co-star in the Jack films) stop being the perennial victim. Finally, after three films, Billy apparently finally taught her martial arts and she, as well as Billy, deliver some well-earned butt-kickings in one scene! This actually was well done and helped the film tremendously. Also, while the film stuck VERY close to the original material (too close if you ask me), the basic story, no matter how bastardized, is still very good--so good that Laughlin couldn't help produce a reasonably entertaining film--provided you turn off your brain and don't think too much about putting Billy Jack in this locale. Plus you gotta admit that Laughlin sure seemed sincere--and infused the film with some nice energy late in the film--and not in the form of butt-kickings (I half expected him to do this on the Senate floor)! This section of the film was, at times, too intense, but at least it was NOT an exact copy of Jimmy Stewart.However, despite some good intentions, the premise of Billy Jack taking on and winning against the evil special interest groups is silly--and also way too idealistic--and probably will result in a few laughs. While not a terrible film, it pales in comparison to the Capra film and occasionally sinks into ridiculousness. Apparently audiences felt pretty much the way I did, as this film never even made it past preview audiences and so it never received a normal theatrical release--though the film was definitely better than THE TRIAL OF BILLY JACK (which made The Fifty Worst Movies of All Time book). Luckily for lovers of the bizarre and bad films (like me), BILLY JACK GOES TO WASHINGTON was finally released on DVD some time back.By the way, because the film was never released until recently, this might explain the poorly executed edits and choppy transitions. Too often, scenes VERY abruptly change and the cuts just aren't made well. In addition, the sound track was too loud and too often dominated the film.

That couldn't have been more unintentionally self aware, because there's no better way to describe his work than a garbage dump of ideas from superior sources.

The best efforts of all the fine actors and visual designers assembled for this misfire add to the disappointment; Kurt Russel must have been pining for another 'Escape From New York' when he trained for 18 months, to get into the best shape of his flabby life.

Nobody could have known what a remarkably superficial powerwash Paul Wasted Script Anderson was capable of performing on this, he could turn Kafka's 'The Trial' into common John Grisham style pablum.I still like 'Soldier', I have some genuine affection for its goofy ineptness.

Yes, he's interested in story and characterisation but he really just wants to deliver an experience that the audience will go away feeling good about. Whether it's a coming of age fable in Spider Man 2 that comes complete with a range of rather epic fight scenes with a tentacled antagonist, or a Western-come-revenge tale complete with hard bodied female lead as more of a match for her male counterparts in The Quick and the Dead or even the classic 'last stand' scenario complete with balance of inventive camera work and lashings of gore as seen in The Evil Dead; Sam Raimi toys with genre, delivers generic pictures but plays and has fun with other conventions, usually culminating in creating something a little special. A Simple Plan is his morality tale crime saga about small town American life and what the American dream really means to some people.I think A Simple Plan is Raimi's best film from what I've seen, and it carries that timeless re-watchable feel that all great films of this ilk carry; that sort of familiar premise done really, really well no matter who produces them and when they're made. The set up in this case is relatively simple; the sort in which locals encounter a large amount of money apparently unowned given the initial carrier lays there dead, and debate over whether or not to take it. Of course the film does not revolve around this decision in one scene as much as it does the whole film. In recent picture No Country for Old Men, it takes Moss about five seconds to swipe the money and a lifetime in trying to keep it; here, it's not so much about trying to keep it as much as it is whether they should or not.In Hank Mitchell (Paxton), you have the all American; clean cut; small town guy who gets along with his healthy lifestyle; good job and loving wife named Sarah (Fonda) who's additionally got a baby on the way. It is less-so this character and more-so this mentality or persona that is placed in the moral predicament do you take the money in order to keep it or do you take it in order to hand it in? Initially reluctant, Hank is given the burden but only after some persistence from a Southern buddy named Lou Chambers (Briscoe) whose eyes light up with dollar signs in a second, perhaps similarly to Moss' in recent said film.The visual clue Raimi drops is to do with the birds that house the downed plane housing the dead pilot and the cash in the first place. Crows; crows as scavengers, feeding off the dead pilot's body and taking what it is they have found through this act of chance that was the initial plane crash. Now the human beings have arrived, they too must decide if they are to scavenge from the wreck they have stumbled upon &#150; it's true that it isn't a matter of life and death with them, but it that doesn't mean the decision isn't life changing.The film raises questions to do with one's identity and one's drive to follow through with a new-found sense of greed. It is no coincidence that the money is stumbled upon whilst everyone is on the brink of the start of a new year. Everything is 'all change' and Hank is taking on a scenario and a belief that the right or at least sensible thing to do is to keep the money and split it between Lou and his slightly more simple brother Jacob (Thornton) with whom he finds it with. It is a clash of mentalities and a stirring of the conscience on the brink of a new beginning and it is truly interesting to watch unfold amid everything else.In true classical noir fashion, Hank narrates the story from the future in a downbeat and somewhat sad tone, perhaps reluctant? The sorts of questions that I began asking myself half way through were to do with whether he'd been caught or perhaps someone that meant a lot to him had died or maybe something else was afoot. So if we are invited to see the film through Hank's eyes then all the suspense and drama that arises as a direct result of others, either suspicion or stupidity, resonates with us in the same manner in which it does with Hank. We feel that fear or that pinch that something might, possibly go wrong here and there during some scenes and it is genuinely good film-making on a dramatic and engaging level.Sadly, Jacob's idiocy forces some of the more unnecessarily nervous moments in the film further placing Hank in a situation that may test both his patience and loyalty towards his brother and it's fascinating to see it all unfold. What I really liked was how each character's dream was set up; about how Jacob wants to get a farm going again with the money and that Sarah wants lots of wonderful things for the baby and that she doesn't want, what she deems to be, the pauper lifestyle she's living with Hank right now. The scenario tests the mental agility of its clean-cut characters and murder and betrayal are two of the many ingredients in this pacey and quite gripping thriller that I think will remain many-a person's favourite in years to come.

I like it when it's for the better. Werner Herzog's 1979 version of the classic vampire tale, Nosferatu, is one of those films that has stuck with me. Thankfully it's been for the better. In fact, my appreciation has only continued to grow with time. It's one Herzog's more seen films, thanks to Kinski's reputation and the fact that most versions are in English, but in my opinion, it's one of his more overlooked and under-appreciated.Bram Stoker's Dracula has been adapted countless times, but only a few are really noteworthy. Probably the most widely seen is Coppola's 1992 version. It is not without merits. Gary Oldman is a fine actor, and does a good job with his version of the vampire, and Coppola flared the film up with an interesting visual style. The most respected and also well known version though is the first, FW Murnau's silent Nosferatu eine Syphonie des Grauens. It reserves itself a spot on any film aficionado's must see list for Murnau's expressionist artistry. It was an assuredly constructed film with brilliant imagery and an unforgettable turn by the preternaturally creepy Max Schreck. Many will tell you that while having the highest respect for Murnau's film and its stunning achievements, they found it something of a dull affair. And I include myself in that category. There was also Todd Browning and Bela Lugosi's 1931 version, though it's perhaps more of a cult classic than an artistic masterpiece.And then in the wings is Herzog's version. It too is respected by those who've seen it, and is itself something of a cult classic. It stars the volatile Klaus Kinski, with whom Herzog made five films, including AguirreWrath of God and Fitzcarraldo. Friend, documentarian, and the man who infamously won a bet which resulted in Herzog literally eating his own shoe, Errol Morris once referred to Kinski as a bonified crazy person. That opinion, by most psychological standards, was probably correct. So if there was ever anyone to offer up a performance worthy of comparison to Schreck's original, it's Kinski.The story follows closely to Murnau's version. Bruno Ganz plays Jonathan Harker, who's called to deliver a real estate proposal to the Carpathian castle of Count Dracula. His wife Lucy is nervous of what may come and has strange dreams. His boss, Renfield is seemingly increasingly drifting further into excited insanity as Dracula's arrival draws nearer. Jonathan's trip to Count Dracula's castle is filled with tension and foreboding. He lodges for a night where he hears tales of a vampire and warnings, but continues on through the mountains. This act contains one of the film's most memorable sequences, set to Wagner's Prelude to Das Rheingold. It ends as a carriage mysteriously emerges from the fog to pick up Harker and carry him off to the castle.Count Dracula's castle is the epitome of ominous. The colour palette is lifeless, and of course in tribute to Murnau, shadows seem to take on a life of their own. Harker is greeted by Kinski's terrifying Dracula with uncomfortable courtesy. He searches the castle one day to find Dracula sleeping... in a casket.While Jonathan is incapacitated, Count Dracula makes his way to Wismar on a ship. Mysteriously to the crew, they're all dying off. The ship carries hoards of rats. Is it the plague the captain ponders? When the ship finally arrives, everyone on board is dead. Dracula emerges, with him the rats.To continue to harp on about the story is at this point an exercise in redundancy. We all essentially know what follows - Renfield is Dracula's minion, and the vampire is in love with Harker's wife, Lucy. Herzog changes things up a bit for the end, but it's Herzog and Kinski's execution that sets the film off. It has a terrifying strangeness. The locations are unforgettable - something to be expected from a man who famously declared that he directs landscapes. Delft (in Holland) served as Wismar. Its canals throughout the town are haunting, especially as the death ship squeezes its way through. The castle scenes are filmed at Castle Pernstejn, which I'm told still looks much like it did during filming.The film's opening sequence is of real life mummies in Mexico, which can still be visited. Another strange and surreal moment comes when Harker wakes up to a young boy playing violin above him. It's one of those great Herzog moments that seemingly serve no purpose other than as beautiful oddity. The film's creepiest sequence, and one of the most unforgettable and brilliant scenes I've ever seen, takes place as Lucy walks through the town square. Pigs and grey rats wander freely; the remaining townsfolk dance around the coffins; one group sits down for a nice meal in the wake of a plague. Lucy fights to escape those trying to dance with her, as the soundtrack plays a choral piece. The result is a purely visceral and delirious sequence that has never left my memory.Herzog has said he prefers the German version of Nosferatu over the English. I'm inclined to agree. As the years pass, and the viewings increase, any problems I initially had with the film only seemed to add to Nosferatu's greatness. Some say that in order for a film to be a true masterpiece, it has to be flawed. Herzog's films are filled with little flaws, many due to working with next to no funding. They're deeply personal, and were understandably emotional. And working with Kinski was always a volatile affair. But that's what does make them so endearing. There are many technically perfect films. Yet many of them that don't have that endearing quality. It's films like these that seem to stick with you, for better or for worse. For their flaws, or for what they achieve in spite of them.

But what I mean is that I don't want this character to be Batman forever. The movie by itself is fairly entertaining. Its extremely loud with cheesy action and stuffs that could make an intellectual's brain go crazy.But I may pass this movie for its loud action and somewhat entertaining performance by Jim Carrey. But I felt that his character was flamboyant and positively gay. I know that the director was a homosexual himself but that doesn't mean that he'll have to add a lot of homophobic rubbish content in a superhero movie. Its Batman,a straight superhero movie.I felt that the red hair and the exotic clothes were over-the-top and rather meant for the director's fantasies. I did not find it in Batman and Robin (by the way, that's a horrible movie) but I could spot it in this. Tommy Lee Jones gave an embarrassing performance as Two- face. I also felt that he shared a somewhat homophobic relation with Jim Carrey, you know, the way in which they talked and were close to one another.

Glitter comes to mind, as does Graffiti Bridge. Cool As Ice, though, effortlessly reaches a level of tastelessness and outrageous contempt for narrative that those other films never quite find. As it stands, there aren't many movies out there that go this far in their attempts to push a product, in this case Vanilla Ice. It is a feature-length commercial for its star, and that's literally all it is. While it's not the first movie like this, it is the weirdest example that I've ever seen. There are many reasons, but the biggest reason is that for a movie called Cool As Ice, the star is uncool--to the extreme.Vanilla Ice is such a caricature that even if he had the skill as an actor to connect with the audience, it would be impossible to do so. The scheme seems to be to make him as alien as possible so as to appear cool. It backfires. The character he plays seems to have no name (it's Johnny Van Owen, but you don't really pick up on it). He speaks in some kind of cryptic language that's probably best exemplified in a scene where he announces he's going across the street to schling a schlong. What could that possibly mean? On second thought, never mind.In bad moviedom, Cool As Ice doesn't approach the level of enjoyability that other so bad they're good movies have, but you might be surprised how watchable it really is. Much like the nature-defying bike jump that Ice makes in the opening scenes of the movie, Cool As Ice hurtles over each turn of its framework script without even touching the ground. The scant few dramatic scenes that it dares to attempt are linked together by montage pieces, the best of which is a love montage where Ice and his rich bitch girlfriend drive out into the middle of the desert and jump around the framework of an unfinished house. In slow motion.As far as Vanilla Ice's music, I don't really understand how he could have had the biggest-selling rap album of all time and then suddenly be considered a joke. It's interesting, because nobody will tell you they enjoy Vanilla Ice's music, and yet apparently millions of people bought the record. So the joke is on who? Certainly not Vanilla Ice.But say whatever you will about him, this movie is bizarre. It's got great cinematography, courtesy of Janusz Kaminski, who went on from these humble beginnings to win an Oscar for his work on Schindler's List, after which he worked with Spielberg on a number of his big-budget films. I wonder what he thinks of Cool As Ice these days.

I usually restrain from writing about anything that isn't horror or cult cinema, but I gladly make exceptions for action flicks if they A) are extremely violent and\/or B) feature highly memorable villainous characters.

I've never really been a fan of Steven Seagal and agree that if his role were to be played by Bruce Willis or perhaps even Sylvester Stallone the film could even be better, but it doesn't really matter all that much thanks to Colm Meaney, Gary Busey and Tommy Lee Jones. Particularly Busey as the treacherous and psychopathic commander and Jones as dangerously demented former special agent are so terrific that you'll often even forget Seagal wanders around the ship somewhere as well. A lot of mariners are gathered on the USS Missouri to attend a Pearl Harbour memorial but mostly to participate in the captain's birthday party afterwards. The ideal opportunity for greedy Cmdr.

It's a story about a real down on his luck has-been of a director (Allen) who's so desperate that he's reduced to filming commercials in Canada. So he has no choice but to accept an offer to direct a big movie that could put him back on top - the problem is, the two producers are his ex-wife (Tea Leoni) and her new fiancé who stole her from Allen (Treat Williams). Right before production all the stress gets to Woody and he experiences psychosomatic blindness and has to direct the whole movie without being able to see. He can't blow this important opportunity and has to fake his way through without letting anyone but his trustworthy agent and his Asian cameraman's interpreter know what's happening.This is a sure-fire recipe for laughs, and it mostly delivers. Tea Leoni is perfect for the role of Woody's long-suffering ex who's stuck working with him again under such touchy circumstances. I also enjoy Mark Rydell as his dedicated agent and mentor. Debra Messing plays another in a long line of ditzy young girlfriends who can't seem to resist shacking up with the 66-year-old Allen.

This movie is an insult to humanity. Its is so bad that it is horrible, completely shattering the saying 'So bad, its good'.I have never seen such horrible acting in my life from such highly regarded actors, who gave their worst performances ever. The beginning of the movie was cheesy with Robin complaining over the fact that his name was not Bat. Arnold gave such a terrible performance with his unbearable one-liners such as 'Is the party over?' etc (They're probably in millions). Uma Thurman was extremely lovable in Kill Bill but in this movie, I felt to strangulate her. Her overacting and her unbearable dialogue delivery, which according to her, was her way to charm men, couldn't just do anything. I do not blame Freeze when he told that he would make life hell for her.George Clooney or rather Clowny too was horrible. He was smiling, smiling and smiling. He even smiled in emotional scenes and in scenes where he had to appear angry. I was surprised that he lost the award for Worst Actor in Razzie Awards.Robin, as I have mentioned before, was pathetic.

The effects are great, it isn't really concerned with Sci-Fi but those elements check out alright.I have theories why it wasn't well received at all. - the main character is highly unsympathetic, from start on (for most people, anyway) - the two main characters are divorced, which I think usually isn't a popular plot device, unless it is more than just a plot device and it is ABOUT this couple and their romanceI think it touches some interesting themes but doesn't explore them. Like, I would have been interested to see how the raped woman manages to live on after such an experience. And I would have liked to see some more original ways how the main character uses his invisibility in public. The main character's turn into a monster wasn't all that convincing. He had a lot to live for but he was ready to throw that all away for those powers. It could have worked, but the film doesn't offer a lot of psychological insight.Favourite piece of dialogue Sarah >Yes, Sir!< Sebastian >How come when you say Yes, Sir it kinda sounds like F-ck you!< Sarah >Practice!<Favorite piece of trivia This is the first Hollywood movie of Paul Verhoeven that got an R-rating in its first submission to the MPAA. His previous American films, RoboCop (1987), Total Recall (1990), Basic Instinct (1992), Showgirls (1995) and Starship Troopers (1997) initially received X and NC-17 ratings, of which all except for Showgirls were re-cut to receive an R-rating.

In Blackmail, Annie Ondra has stabbed and killed a lustful neighbor in defense of her virtue. No one knows who committed the murder but the next morning it is the talk of Chelsea. Ondra is haunted by guilt. She sees mementos of the murder everywhere -- a policeman's outstretched hand, or a bread knife. In the back room of her father's small shop, she tries to slice a loaf of bread, but there is a goofy looking woman customer lounging in the doorway and chattering on about the killing. Ondra's hand trembles as she listens to the customer carrying on. Oh, it wouldn't be so bad if the victim were bopped over the head with a brick -- that's a British way. But a knife. How could anyone use a knife? The annoying customer's voice degrades into a background mumble except for one recurring word. Mmmm, mumble, mumble, mumble, KNIFE, mumble, mumble KNIFE! The last one is practically a scream and the bread knife seems to leap out of Ondra's hand. The director was to conduct a number of other experiments with sound later in his career, from Bernard Hermann's shrieking violins in Psycho to the electronic clutter of The Birds. The story itself is kind of interesting if not exactly gripping. Mainly we see Ondra and her detective boy friend from Scotland Yard trying to hide her involvement in the crime. However, it's discovered by a seedy character who begins to blackmail the two of them, at first simply be asking the boy friend to pay for a particularly expensive cigar. An unnerving scene, so small, yet so portentous.It turns out that the blackmailer, although he had nothing to do with the murder outside of seeing Ondra enter the dead man's flat, has a police record. Suspicion falls on him. The police pursue him to the dome of the British Museum. He crashes through the skylight and falls on the floor far below.I didn't find the ending very satisfying. Ondra goes to the police station to confess, which she should have done in the first place. Her boy friend meets her there before she can spill the beans. But until now, he knows only that Ondra was in the would-be rapist's room. Now she tells him that she murdered the libidinous scoundrel. The boy friend -- John Longden by name -- now sees things clearly. He clenches his fists and stares towards the camera, not for the first time. And then he and Ondra walk away together, hand in hand.Well -- what happens NEXT? What did they do, run out of film? Does she hang or go to jail, or is everything swept under the rug by the two of them who are in cahoots? The code would have prevented Annie Ondra's getting away with murder, even if by middle-class standards it might have been justified. But the code doesn't seem to be at work here. The attempted rape is clearly depicted for what it is, though hidden behind a bustling curtain. And Ondra has either been too innocent or not nearly innocent enough, prancing around in her underwear in a strange man's apartment, teasing him when he sketches a nude woman on his canvas, cooing with delight over his attentions.Any conclusion is left hanging, and I didn't get the impression this was intentional ambiguity. Still, the story has an abundance of tension and the guilt that torments Annie Ondra must have appealed to Hitchcock, who was to continue using it as an important theme in his later movies. One wonders what he did as a child. Maybe it's the responsibility of the Jebs.
