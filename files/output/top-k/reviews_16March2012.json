We should all be thankful that Hollywood had the foresight to realize that it's director David Fincher managed to show considerable talent and saved it from the ultimate train wreck it's long, problematic development meant it should have been. After throwing himself under the bus to complete ALIEN 3, Fincher was given the chance to prove what he was really capable of with SE7EN. The film is a modern classic and most people will agree. I love a good serial killer story, and SE7EN is right up there at the top of the list with the best of them. Thanks to it's gripping story, talented performances, and an ending that will go down as one of the most memorable, SE7EN is an excellent movie well-deserving of the long-term attention it's gotten and the status it helped to build for Fincher. In the film, Detective William Somerset is one week from his retirement and begins training his replacement, the younger and more naïve Detective David Mills. Mills is a hotshot with an impatient attitude, recently transferred from a small town to the big city where he hopes to make a difference. Mills' first case, and Somerset's supposed final, turns into something larger than your average homicide. A new serial killer has come to light and he is using torture and murder to preach against the seven deadly sins to his victims (e.g. an obese man is forced to eat himself to death at gunpoint).This is a dark, twisted movie. From the very beginning we open with a warped credits sequence and a glimpse into the methods of the yet-unknown serial killer to the remixed sound of Nine Inch Nails' Closer. And it only gets more twisted from there. We never actually see the murderer (with the inconspicuous name John Doe) in action as the audience. Instead, we see the aftermath as Somerset and Mills arrive on the scene and each crime scene is more brutal than the last. John Doe is a psychopath and uses his victims to preach his message in the worst way possible. SE7EN is the most gripping serial killer\/thriller since THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and even now, almost twenty years since it's release, is just as powerful as always. While there may not be any brutal violence occurring on screen, I would still recommend discretion for audience members who don't care for the darker subject matter. Despite the fact the movie was released in 1995, I'll try to remain spoiler-free when discussing the movie just in case, but the end of this movie has been parodied and paid homage countless times since. It's a strong ending and I'm glad it didn't cop out and go the usual route where the killer is stopped before his crimes can escalate and the story ends on a high note. Not here; it's a bittersweet ending where you could even go so far as to say the villain triumphs over the heroes.Every element of this movie contributes to its strength. The cinematography from Darius Khondji is amazing. The visual style of this movie is just as prominent as any performance. The high contrast, abundance of low lighting, overcast weather and sharp instances of source lighting (I really loved the red neon cross in Doe's apartment) gives this movie an overwhelming feeling of gloom that coincides with Detective Somerset's view on life in the city. I would love to get my hands on the screenplay from Andrew Kevin Walker for this one, as it's incredibly well written and was perfectly suited for the talents of someone as visually strong as director Fincher. The cast in this movie, again inspired. The only real important characters in the film are Somerset (Morgan Freeman), Mills (Brad Pitt), and the killer John Doe (who I won't spoil here on the off chance that someone reading this has not seen the movie and somehow avoided any and all revelations about Doe). Morgan Freeman is the kind of actor where you expect a powerful performance, and he delivers just that. Somerset is a jaded detective who's spent years on the force and seen it all (until Doe came along); he's tired and he's ready to find a simpler life. I've also got to give Pitt some great credit here because SE7EN was the movie that helped me realize Pitt was more talented than I'd believed and more than just a Hollywood pretty boy (further solidified in FIGHT CLUB, another awesome Fincher film). And finally, the actor portraying John Doe is excellent. Doe is a cold, calculating killer who truly believes in what he is doing and the actor gives one of the best eerie performances. All together, this all combines to create one of the best films of the 90s and almost guaranteed to become a favorite.

This movie is on par with the Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns, which were nothing short of magnificent. I remember reading an article from around 1970 that old west actors such as John Wayne were very angry with the way this movie depicted the old west. Are you kidding?! I suppose they never read history in the old west. It was never about just the good guys and the bad guys. There were bounty hunters who played both sides for their own benefit (Clint Eastwood's character was just such a person). This was how the west really was........Ultra Violent!

Edmond Dantès, a young sailor, is arrested and charged with treason against the restored monarch Louis XVIII. Although he is innocent, he is imprisoned in the Château d'If, a notorious prison on an island in Marseilles harbour. After fifteen years he manages to escape and subsequently becomes immensely wealthy. (As with all good adventure story heroes, the source of his wealth is a long-lost buried treasure). Calling himself The Count of Monte Cristo, after the Italian island on which the treasure was found, he returns to France swearing revenge on the three men who conspired to have him imprisoned. They are Danglars, a jealous former shipmate who coveted a promotion which went to Dantès, Villefort, a corrupt magistrate anxious to cover up some murky secrets in his own past, and Dantès' aristocratic one-time friend Fernand Mondego, who betrayed him because of his lust for Dantès' beautiful fiancée Mercédès.I won't set out the plot in any more detail, as it gets quite complex, although not quite as complicated as Alexandre Dumas' original novel. Suffice it to say that it is a swashbuckling adventure in the best traditional manner, reminiscent of the sort of movies that Errol Flynn, Stewart Granger and a young Burt Lancaster were making in the 1940s and 1950s. (There is a superb duel between Dantès and Mondego).I understand that there have been numerous earlier cinema adaptations of the novel, although I have not seen any of them. This version, however, is a splendid one, one of the best adventure films of the 2000s. James Caviezel seemed to be one of the rising stars of the early twenty-first century, and although I have not heard much of him since he played Jesus in Mel Gibson's controversial The Passion of the Christ, he makes an excellent swashbuckling hero. There are also good contributions from Guy Pearce as the false and treacherous Mondego, Richard Harris in one of his penultimate feature film (his last was to be Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets) as the Abbé Faria, another prisoner who befriends Dantès in the Château d'If, and the lovely Dagmara Dominczyk as Mercédès. Dagmara is another actor of whom not much has been heard since she did this film; perhaps she might have had more luck with a more Anglo-Saxon name.The film was directed by Kevin Reynolds who clearly has a talent for adventure films of this type, as he also made a very decent version of the Robin Hood legend, Robin Hood- Prince of Thieves. He was, of course, also responsible for the dreadful Waterworld, one of the great turkeys of the nineties, but having seen the brilliant The Count of Monte Cristo I can forgive him even for that. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 March 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The Count of Monte Cristo is set in the France of the 1810s, 1820s and 1830s, the years during which the French monarchy was re-established following the fall of Napoleon.

While this film was not a hit at the box office upon release, it has gained a rabid cult following. If you were to take the John Hughes films of the 80\u2032s, mix them up with a bit of 12 Monkeys sprinkle in a touch of David Lynch, then you might craft a similar film. Donnie Darko is the sort of film that you will watch and then wonder what exactly just happened. Then sit down and re watch again. The plot involves time travel, a mysterious fat guy in red jump suit and a 6 foot tall evil-looking bunny rabbit named Frank.Donnie is in many ways a typical adolescent high school student. He attends a private school, is highly intelligent, yet gets into trouble for questioning authority figures and juvenile shenanigans. However, Donnie also has a bit of a dark side, he has been sleep walking, seeing a therapist and taking his prescribed medication sporadically. The opening scene of the film, shows Donnie asleep in the road next to his bike as morning dawns, Donnie has been sleep riding again.We soon learn that Donnie has been having visions. Specifically, a six-foot tall scary as hell looking bunny that tells Donnie things. Frank the Bunny instructs Donnie to leave his bed again and go outside, he informs Donnie that the world is going to end in 28 days 6 hours 42 minutes and 12 seconds. When Donnie awakes, it's morning again and he is on the green of a golf course. Upon returning home he is shocked to discover that his house is surrounded by police, and FBI agents, and a Jet engine has crashed through the roof of his house and into his bedroom. It appears that Frank the Bunny has saved Donnie's life by having him sleep on a golf course. Donnie starts to give much more credence to the words of Frank and his prophecies.Soon we are introduced to his school, friends, sexy English teacher (Drew Barrymore), and learn more about his family dynamics and his world in general. While a classic 80\u2032s soundtrack plays in the background, the frequency of Donnie's interactions with Frank and subsequent anti-social behaviors increase. However, all is not terrible in Donnie's life as he soon finds a kindred spirit and girlfriend in Gretchen (Jena Malone), the new girl at school. As the time till when the world will end draws ever closer, Donnie becomes more and more interested in a book written about the philosophy of time travel, and righting the wrongs he perceives around him. Will the world really end or is Donnie slipping further and further into some sort of schizoaffective disorder?No I am not going to give the ending of the film away, or attempt to explain my interpretation of the movie, you will have to watch it for yourself. Or wait for a later post on discussion of the film. Strong performances by both the lead Jake Gyllenhaal, and the supporting cast, including Maggie Gyllenhaal, Mary McDonnell, Patrick Swayze and others add to the immersive world created by the writer\/director. If you went to high school in the late 1980\u2032s, or enjoy movies that will keep you guessing and foster lots of discussion upon conclusion, you might want to add this film to your Netflix queue.

Fashioning the man of steel after a circus performer who did daring feats under the big top, Superman wore a leotard and cape to accentuate his physical prowess in his never ending battle for Truth, Justice and the American WAY.Fast forward nearly forty years, and the mercenary team of the Salkind family is awarded the rights to produce a film from the comic book hero. Said film was to fall back on their formula for the musketeer films some five years before by having lots of humor injected into the piece.But cast and crew took a different tone. The magnificent direction of Richard Donner, one of the supreme talents of film making, enlisted into his ranks the only man who could possible play the last son of Krypton, the late Christopher Reeve (no relation to George Reeves who played the character in the 1950's TV version). He also brought in maestro John Williams and a host of talents to bring Krypton and Metropolis (located right next to, and often mistaken for New York) to life.The movie going public did not have all of the gadgetry we have today. Entertainment, BIG entertainment, did not come from the latest app for your i-gizmo or cell phone. It wasn't a market tailored b-movie that opened internationally for two weeks, and was then pulled for DVD, bluray and direct download. No. Entertainment back then was in the form of the big variety show on TV, and whatever the next big picture was to hit the movie houses.Superman was such a film. But enough history, to the movie. Donner's direction style shows us Americana. This is one of the great American films, even though it was predominantly produced and shot in the UK. What we have here is a slice of how America was east of the Rockies, right down to the humble farm family raising their adopted son. We see superb shots of the country side, we feel the angst and emotion of a young man needing to break away from the family farm, and his emergence onto society and into the American imagination when he makes his presence known.The film touches on most of the classic Superman mythos, including some of Jor-El's old enemies back on Krypton. The score, the shots, the thesping by leads and support, the pacing and dramatic structure of the film are really in top form here. Donner, known for such halmarks as The Omen, Goonies and the Leathal Weapon series, is in his usual element and top form when grabbing hold of the material at hand here.Note the shot setup. The slow pacing of editing and element of dramatic discovery in all the shots. Note how the shot compliments the actors, and how the music accents the moment. This is film making as it should be. Coming from the old school like Lucas, Kubrick, Kurosawa and Coppola, Donner really delivers a feast for movie lovers all around the globe. That, and the story material is excellent to begin with.Technical side and criticisms; there's a few minor glitches in the film. The outer space sequence plays well in the big theatre, but it loses scale when on the small screen. That's not so bad. There's the train race sequence which sorta works, but the transition shots are mis-paced with the masters. The Krypton sequence is mostly good, but the ship carrying little infant Supes loses credibility at a certain point. Some of the blue screen stuff, to me at least, felt like it needed to be shot live on location, rather than on a stage. The problem suffered by the Krypton space ship is echoed by the missiles later on, but it's nothing serious. But those are all minor details that usually gloss over the audience. Oh sure, we all get that such and such isn't real, and even looks a little fake, but we're going to accept it for expediency of the story, because that's what we're interested in. And when the emotional weight hits the audience, then all is forgiven. When holding this up to more contemporary comic-book hero offerings, to me at least, there's no comparison. Superman is biblical in portion and design. It tells of a savior who leads by example, and does no more than he is able and proper. Even so he is a man, however extraordinary his abilities. He holds his own power in cheque, and makes sure that it is his own personal tenets that win the day. This is what Superman is all about. The strength, the eyesight, flight, speed, cape and suit are all adornments for what the real man of tomorrow is all about; upholding the strengths of the past that make men of today.All in all an excellent film for a night's entertainment. It's not the first superhero film as such, but it's the first contemporary one to put what had been little boy's fairy tale fare into a more realistic and believable existence. We see our own young ideals, hammered into us during our formative years, put to the test via Kal-El. And when he holds fast to his own credo, that's when we cheer.

Fashioning the man of steel after a circus performer who did daring feats under the big top, Superman wore a leotard and cape to accentuate his physical prowess in his never ending battle for Truth, Justice and the American WAY.Fast forward nearly forty years, and the mercenary team of the Salkind family is awarded the rights to produce a film from the comic book hero. Said film was to fall back on their formula for the musketeer films some five years before by having lots of humor injected into the piece.But cast and crew took a different tone. The magnificent direction of Richard Donner, one of the supreme talents of film making, enlisted into his ranks the only man who could possible play the last son of Krypton, the late Christopher Reeve (no relation to George Reeves who played the character in the 1950's TV version). He also brought in maestro John Williams and a host of talents to bring Krypton and Metropolis (located right next to, and often mistaken for New York) to life.The movie going public did not have all of the gadgetry we have today. Entertainment, BIG entertainment, did not come from the latest app for your i-gizmo or cell phone. It wasn't a market tailored b-movie that opened internationally for two weeks, and was then pulled for DVD, bluray and direct download. No. Entertainment back then was in the form of the big variety show on TV, and whatever the next big picture was to hit the movie houses.Superman was such a film. But enough history, to the movie. Donner's direction style shows us Americana. This is one of the great American films, even though it was predominantly produced and shot in the UK. What we have here is a slice of how America was east of the Rockies, right down to the humble farm family raising their adopted son. We see superb shots of the country side, we feel the angst and emotion of a young man needing to break away from the family farm, and his emergence onto society and into the American imagination when he makes his presence known.The film touches on most of the classic Superman mythos, including some of Jor-El's old enemies back on Krypton. The score, the shots, the thesping by leads and support, the pacing and dramatic structure of the film are really in top form here. Donner, known for such halmarks as The Omen, Goonies and the Leathal Weapon series, is in his usual element and top form when grabbing hold of the material at hand here.Note the shot setup. The slow pacing of editing and element of dramatic discovery in all the shots. Note how the shot compliments the actors, and how the music accents the moment. This is film making as it should be. Coming from the old school like Lucas, Kubrick, Kurosawa and Coppola, Donner really delivers a feast for movie lovers all around the globe. That, and the story material is excellent to begin with.Technical side and criticisms; there's a few minor glitches in the film. The outer space sequence plays well in the big theatre, but it loses scale when on the small screen. That's not so bad. There's the train race sequence which sorta works, but the transition shots are mis-paced with the masters. The Krypton sequence is mostly good, but the ship carrying little infant Supes loses credibility at a certain point. Some of the blue screen stuff, to me at least, felt like it needed to be shot live on location, rather than on a stage. The problem suffered by the Krypton space ship is echoed by the missiles later on, but it's nothing serious. But those are all minor details that usually gloss over the audience. Oh sure, we all get that such and such isn't real, and even looks a little fake, but we're going to accept it for expediency of the story, because that's what we're interested in. And when the emotional weight hits the audience, then all is forgiven. When holding this up to more contemporary comic-book hero offerings, to me at least, there's no comparison. Superman is biblical in portion and design. It tells of a savior who leads by example, and does no more than he is able and proper. Even so he is a man, however extraordinary his abilities. He holds his own power in cheque, and makes sure that it is his own personal tenets that win the day. This is what Superman is all about. The strength, the eyesight, flight, speed, cape and suit are all adornments for what the real man of tomorrow is all about; upholding the strengths of the past that make men of today.All in all an excellent film for a night's entertainment. It's not the first superhero film as such, but it's the first contemporary one to put what had been little boy's fairy tale fare into a more realistic and believable existence. We see our own young ideals, hammered into us during our formative years, put to the test via Kal-El. And when he holds fast to his own credo, that's when we cheer.

Mr. Smith Goes to Washington stars James Stewart as a naive Junior Senator in a world of corruption and career politicians. Overwhelmed by his surroundings and his new job he leans on an old friend of his fathers and his own childhood hero Senior Senator Joseph Paine (Claude Rains) for advice and direction. Mr. Smith finds that this country's government is not what he thought it was and neither is Senator Paine. If not for the friendship with his secretary, Miss Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur), Mr. Smith's stay in Washington would have been very disenchanting. Through sheer will and determination Mr. Smith takes on the corruption of Washington and tries to fight for, what seems to be, a lost cause.James Stewart's performance in this film was masterful and he was justly nominated for an Academy Award. He exuded innocence and sincerity with every word and every nervous stumble played out perfectly as he obviously dove into this character head first. There are several scenes throughout the movie that pull on your patriotic strings as you , the viewer, are reminded of what this nation is built on and for, as you connect with Mr. Smith's cause.Not to go unrecognized are Jean Arthur and Claude Rains performances, in which they were also nominated for an Academy Award. Both of these actors were incredible and so well suited for their roles. Rains' performance in the final scene of this film was memorable, as the pressure of Mr. Smith's honesty and integrity start to wear on his conscience.Directed by Frank Capra, who 7 years later directed Stewart in It's a Wonderful Life, this film moves along purposefully, as the viewer experiences the ups and downs of Mr. Smith's journey . There are many critics who believe this film to be his best, nominated for an Academy Award Capra lost out to Victor Fleming and Gone With the Wind.Nominated for 11 Academy Awards, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a movie that pulls at all the right places and pushes at all the right times. The film is about innocence versus corruption, good versus evil, right versus wrong and having hope when facing adversity. Although made over 70 years ago the story is still relevant and maybe even more so today, than it was then.

I would suggest to everybody that enjoyed this movie, to read this story. It's not very long, about 80+ pages, but well worth the time. Reading the novella actually increased my enjoyment and understanding of the film. Obviously, the film is loosely-based on the novella. The time period, setting and circumstances were completely different in the film than in the story. Coppola, and the screenwriters, however, managed to capture one of the most important aspects of the story in the savagery that exists in the jungle and the effects it can have on the human psyche. I found Marlow's growing fascination with Kurtz in the book to be an interesting parallel to Willard's , played by Martin Sheen, fascination with the colonel. As both men travel up their respective rivers, getting ever closer actually meeting the man that inspired the admiration and obsession in both of these men, they come to start to understand the reasoning's and methods to their respective Kurtz's insanity. As Willard sets upon his journey, he encounters obvious examples of the Army's hypocrisy in their wants to remove Kurtz from his post. Was Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore's insanity more excusable than Kurtz's? From the brutality of war that he witnessed in his prior tours of Vietnam, to the savagery that plagues his current mission, he starts to see the world as Kurtz does, understanding the inner machinations of the man's mind. There is a contrast here to Conrad's Marlow, in that Willard starts out as a jaded character, and judges Kurtz from different point of view than Marlowe does. As Marlowe is just a steamboat captain that works for The Company, his interpretation of Kurtz is different. Both, however, come to realize their own inner darkness that occupies a hidden corner in their heart. With Willard, his transformation at the end of the film after he kills Kurtz and is standing in the doorway of the temple(?), covered in mud and blood is a perfect allegory to the darkness that filled his heart.Kurtz is the most powerful character here. As in the novella, Colonel Kurtz is a man shrouded in mystery. As Willard learns more about him, we start to see a different side of the man than the man Army Intelligence portrays. They portray him as a monster, whereas, we start to see the multi-talented, enigmatic side of Kurtz as Willard starts to learn about him. Even though he is in less than 10% of the film, much like the novella, his shadow casts a darkness over the entire jungle and his presence is felt throughout the entire movie. Marlon Brando turned in another excellent performance as the mad colonel, with his philosophical ravings and soliloquies being some of the best he's put on film. A large part of the success of the portrayal of Kurtz does definitely have to go to the film's director though. Coppola does a fantastic job of keeping Brando in shadows and Brando uses the shadows to his advantage, almost wearing the darkness like a thick blanket. He is often portraying Kurtz as hunched over, as if weighted down by the darkness in his heart. This performance left no doubt as to why Coppola would want to work with this genius again, after previously working with him on The Godfather. This is one of the finer films in film history and certainly deserves its place as a classic piece of cinema. Both the novella and the film go to lengths to warn us of the darkness that exists in all of us, and what may be madness to most people, may just be enlightenment.The horror... the horror...

Something I haven't done in a long while, I can't for certain remember the film that caused it. When the film ended, I sat in silence for about 10 minutes.On the Waterfront is an inspiring film. There's a feeling you get watching it- movie magic. Something great is playing out in front of your eyes and you are taking in the collective effort of geniuses. Right from the start, with the dramatic score (that stays fine throughout) introducing the film, something special is happening.The plot synopsis gives the appearance of a plain film, and plain it is not. The mob, murder and romance are the stars of this show and right off the start this is apparent- like the lighting of a fuse. Then as the wick burns down, the drama unfolds. We learn about Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando), his past and present, and his conflicted thoughts. We are introduced to characters that push him down the path he has to choose. A viewer grows to care about Terry, and until he decides for himself, we have no idea what he'll do.This film is an acting gold magnet- it received 5 nominations in acting alone. I'll start with Brando's legendary performance. It doesn't matter what you think of him offscreen because for 2 hours he is at his very best, one of the best in acting ever. Terry is a fantastic character and Brando gives an unrivalled, honest performance.Wanting him to stand against his negative influences are Father Barry (Karl Malden) and Edie (Eva Marie Saint). The father is a frustrated man, furious in his quest for righteousness. Only in The Exorcist have I liked a priest as much. He gives a raging performance, at its peak with a scolding of the longshoremen. Riveting. With him, but quite the opposite in character is Edie, who falls into the plot. Saint aces her characters role, which is to mold Terry. Their scenes are tender, believable, and in a recurring theme with the film, honest. During their bar scene I thought they could've just made a romance together, leaving out all the drama.On the other side, the mob union leaders, we have Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb), the head honcho, who is ferocious, intimidating, and impeccably evil to honest workers. There's also Charley (Rod Steiger), Terry's older brother who is comfortably in with the mob. I didn't notice him at all, except for 'the scene' which must've made him in the Academy's eyes.Speaking of 'the scene', the pivotal Taxi cab dialogue between Terry and Charley, you can tell as it happens this is the moment, the peak of On the Waterfront and Marlon Brando. It is the turning point of the film, where Terry makes some huge realizations that we can infer from only his face and tone. I won't even discuss his words, as it's been done by absolutely everyone. There are several other great scenes, like the 'It's a crucifixion' speech and the various rooftop scenes.Right until the last scene we aren't sure what will happen. I won't spoil it, but it's elevating. Heroic. Even enlightening.On the Waterfront is about the small speaking out against the large and corrupt. It's about going against the flow, breaking the silence. Sometime in your life you were or will be in Terry's position to some degree, and you'll either do or don't.

With stupendous performances, a top notch story and a strong message, On the Waterfront is film at it's best. 9.4\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"16 March 2012","score":"8 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":" At the end of 'The Spy Who Loved Me' we were promised that Bond would return in 'For Your Eyes Only'&#x85; that was before 'Star Wars' burst onto the world's cinema screens and suddenly everybody wanted science fiction!

Felicia, a teenage girl from a rural part of the Irish Republic, travels to Birmingham to find her boyfriend Johnny, who she believes works in a lawnmower factory. (In fact, Johnny has joined the British Army, but wants to keep this a secret, as the part of Ireland he comes from is a hotbed of Republican sentiment). Felicia (who, it transpires, is pregnant by Johnny) is befriended by a middle-aged man named Joe Hilditch, who works as a factory catering manager. At first Hilditch seems kindly and helpful, but it soon becomes clear that there may be sinister motives behind his interest in Felicia. In a series of flashbacks we learn of Felicia's life in Ireland and her relationship with her strict, moralistic father, and of Hilditch's own past. We learn that he is the son of Gala, a famous television chef from the 1950s. He is a curiously old-fashioned character; he regularly watches his mother's old black-and-white programmes, lives in her old house, which does not appear to have been redecorated or refurnished for about forty years, and drives an old Morris Minor which he refers to by the antiquated slang term jalopy. (Even when it was current slang, jalopy, meaning an old and dilapidated car, was primarily an Americanism, little used in Britain). He appears to have inherited not only his mother's house but also her culinary skills, cooking himself sumptuous meals, which makes one owner why he is not working in a smart restaurant or hotel rather than a factory canteen. As is common in social-realist cinema, the film paints a bleak picture of the industrial landscapes of Birmingham. Its picture of rural Ireland, however, is equally bleak, about as far from the sentimental Ballykissangel image as one can get, despite (or perhaps because of) the fact that the film was based on a novel by an Irish writer, William Trevor, who also wrote the screenplay. The Irish Republic we see here is a grim, cheerless place, dominated by a sectarian religiosity and bitter memories of who did what to whom in the 1920s, a place where a father can call his daughter a whore to her face if he disapproves of her choice of boyfriend.The brightest thing about this picture was the performance of the nineteen-year-old Elaine Cassidy as the determined if naïve young Felicia; I am surprised not to have heard more of her in the years since 1999. Bob Hoskins is suitably creepy and sinister as Hilditch, whom we first assume to be a sexual predator until we learn that he is in fact something far worse. There are, however, some things about his character that do not ring true. His strong working-class Brummie accent, for example, does not seem right on the lips of a man who lives in a large arts-and-crafts mansion and who, as the son of a wealthy celebrity, would doubtless have enjoyed a privileged education. Like a number of actors with a skill for reproducing various regional accents, Hoskins seems to enjoy showing off that skill even when the accent in question would not be entirely appropriate to his character. (I remember another film where he did a convincing imitation of a New York accent, which would have been fine had his character actually been from New York rather than California). More importantly- and here the fault lies more with the script than with the actor- we never really understand exactly what has happened to turn Hilditch into a serial killer, even though the idea of narrating part of his backstory was presumably to give us an insight into his psychology. If the implication was supposed to be that his eccentric mother, who used him as a sort of prop on her cookery shows, had left him with a hatred of women, this needed to be spelled out much more clearly. The film seems to have been intended as a psychological study- it is too slow-moving to work as a thriller- but is too mystifying really to work as such. The film has its points of interest, but overall it is one I found rather unsatisfactory. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 March 2012","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Felicia's Journey is an example of the long-standing tradition of kitchen sink realism in the British cinema.
