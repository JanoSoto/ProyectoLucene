[{"date":"13 June 2011","score":"","review":" This film is a valiant effort to tell a story about a profoundly contemptible human being. It features a fine performance from Geoffrey Rush and boatloads of provocative, controversial moments, but the movie founders on its failed efforts to makes excuses for the horrible nature of its main character.Set in an asylum during Napoleonic France, Quills tells the last bit of the life story of the Marquis De Sade (Geoffrey Rush), the legendarily perverse and deviant writer. He's been locked up in the asylum to try and contain his monstrous imagination, yet he continues to smuggle out new works of blasphemy and pornography with the help of a chamber maid named Madeleine (Kate Winslet). The head of the asylum, a priest named Coulmier (Joanquin Phoenix), is blissfully unaware of De Sade's continued writing until Napoleon himself sends the harsh and unbending Dr. Royer-Collard (Michael Caine) to put a stop to De Sade's activities. Royer-Collard presses hard on Coulmier to muzzle De Sade, which results in an increasingly desperate battle of wills between the holy man and the infamous smut-wallower.There are a lot of good things about Quills. It has a lot of sharply written dialog and compelling scenes performed by a talented cast. Geoffrey Rush is quite bold and charismatic as De Sade, but that is the character that the script crashes into and never quite gets around. The Marquis De Sade was, by pretty much any standard, a vile and contemptible human being. He's really not the equivalent of a modern-day pornographer because, not only did his writing dwell on grotesque violence as much as sexual depravity, but De Sade himself engaged in acts that would be considered awful crimes both in his day and ours.De Sade was something like a cultural terrorist and that's not much of an overstatement. If you're going to portray De Sade as some sort of anti-hero or a tragic figure, you need to provide some greater justification for his abominable behavior. His degeneracy needs to be in pursuit of a higher value like truth or freedom. As Quills presents him, De Sade is pretty much a degenerate for the sake of degeneracy. That makes it hard to feel any empathy for him and his situation, no matter how difficult and extreme that situation becomes. The story does suggest his obsession with perversion was a reaction to what De Sade saw during the Terror of the French Revolution. That's an excuse, though, not a justification.Seemingly to compensate for its inability to grapple with its main character, Quills offers up not one but two subplots. One is about the forbidden attraction between priest Coulmier and Madeleine, which does fold back into the struggle between Coulmier and De Sade. The other is about Royer-Collard and his young bride Simone (Amelia Wainer), which is fairly superfluous to the story. It could be completely removed from the film and nothing of importance would be lost. Neither subplot stands on its own and it feels like they were woven into the script because writer Doug Wright didn't know what else he could do with his main character.There's a moderate amount of profanity, nudity and other things of a prurient nature in this film, though not to the excessive amounts that would do justice to the Marquis De Sade. This movie is also, in almost all respects, a well-executed bit of filmmaking. If you go into it thinking already believing there's something worthwhile about De Sade and his lifestyle, you'll probably enjoy Quills. If you're mostly ignorant or have a negative view of the Marquis, you won't find anything here that will enlighten or change your mind.

BUT I know how it feels not to exploit one's own talents for his personal life and constantly try to find excuses for that.The story is probably one of the most inspiring and best written scripts from the last two decades, and to think that Matt Damon is the co-writer, with his childhood friend, Ben Affleck &#x96; they both played best buddies in the film- makes it even more realistic and inspiring. In fact, there is something that always works in the stories where the screenwriter and the lead actor are the same, take Citizen Kane, The Great Dictator, Rocky, Sling Blade or the vast majority of Woody Allen's films, the character is written and played by the same actor, he's his own mind, and own body, there is an authentic feeling as if the man doesn't even play. The script is personal, and the film is only an excuse to transcend something personal into a biggest project that would create a wider appeal. And I would never say enough how Good Will Hunting appealed to me.The story, is about a kid, a tough kid, an extremely intelligent tough kid who grew in South Boston and lived the kind of childhood that could have been laughably cliché had the movie been handled by a bad director or editor. But the revelations of his past go so smoothly that Will Hunting, despite his good intentions, appears more like an arrogant prick than a victim, and THIS is interesting. To depict him as a victim would have considerably changed the value of his gift, it would have been the solution of his problems while in fact, it works like a double-edged sword. Will has an extraordinary power of abstraction, or memorization, of understanding that he can solve the toughest Maths problems, can speak of History, Geography, Politics, Economics, Philosophy, like you'd speak about the one thing that passionate you the most, and he probably knows better than you even in that field. Basically, Will makes you feel dumb, or useless, or unable to use your own knowledge. Even the professor Gerald Lambeau, who'll try to find a future for Will, ends up like a Salieri recognizing his worthless value compared to Will, the Mozart of Mathematics.But the key of the story is to understand the reasons of Will's behavior, which obviously would lead him to a dead-end. When you think about it, his intelligence saved him from jail, which allowed him to know his girlfriend. Speaking of her, let's get back to the scene where they meet. The scene is probably one of the most memorable cinematic ownage where Will avenges his best friend who was victim of a literally intellectual bullying by an arrogant Harvard prick. Will puts him in his place with the idea that it doesn't takes studies to be intelligent, it takes enough curiosity to learn more than what we're intended to and then try to put that knowledge into perspective. An excellent lesson about how to use our intelligence. But then something ambiguous happens, when Will meets his therapist, Sean Maguire, Robin Williams in a quite perfect performance. Will acts with him exactly the same way the Harvard boy did, using his knowledge to try to push him down. But instead of being upset, Sean feels the potential of Will and a nice retort for the next meeting. Do you think I would understand how it feels to be an orphan because I read Oliver twist? Will knows, but his knowledge is theoretical, there's the tragic feeling of emptiness governing his life. Life is about guts, heart, emotions, and Sean, animated by a growing fatherly love, will try to open Will's heart, so he can give his life a meaning as Sean obviously found something in Will, to get out from his self-pitied widow condition, a man lost in his memories with no better future.Will Hunting is not a bad guy, as implies the title's adjective. But he fears rejection, and hangs out with the same group which work like an indirect carapace. He's certainly not incapable of being friendly, in love or having fun, but as soon as things go serious, he becomes defensive. The movie provides a fascinating character study in the real sense of the world, we are put in the shoes of a psychiatrist and try to understand Sean's motives, and why Will is such a hard nut to crack. It's an intelligent movie about intelligence, and that respects our intelligence, and more than that, the intelligence of the film is carried by an excellent script that brings so many moments of verbal delights. Will's speeches are priceless; it's like reciting a whole book, with coherence and inspiration. And the films question our visions of intelligence  for Lambeau, it's Excellence, for Maguire, it's Happiness. The inspiring message of the film, is that Will Hunting can reconcile between both. Inspiring is indeed a word that rhymes with Good Will Hunting. And I think Minnie Driver deserves a mention as the one who drove the heart element of the film, as Skylar &#x96;why did they had to name her like that anyway-, who had such a genuine feeling, I thought her romance and break-up created another authentic dimension in Will's multi-layered personality.Good Will Hunting is an exploration into the complexities of human relationships, and on a self-reflexive approach, the conclusion of the film is like a mathematical problem finally solved, but human relationships is not an exact science you know, so maybe, I say maybe, happiness is a little more important than excellence &#x85; as the French author, Michel de Montaigne, said once  a well-made rather than a well-filled head.

One of the best movies ever; best acting performance ever; robbed of Best Picture; its accolades are intimidating. So when I finally found it on Blu Ray, I gasped out loud. It had found me, and I was going to see the best sports movie ever made.I made myself a snack, customary of any movie for me. I went to my basement, put the disc in my player, and started it up. Instantly, I was engaged the menu, with De Niro warming up alone in the ring, a saddening orchestral melody; I knew this was going to demand my full attention. I ate my entire snack before starting, I didn't want to miss anything. I started the old, fat LaMotta, rhyming to himself. Then BAM! fighting, 20 years earlier. This was it, a milestone in American cinema.Then the disappointment began. There was talking, and small fits of rage, but as the film progressed, I got... bored. Scorsese has never bored me. And the worst part was, I didn't know what was so bad! I've enjoyed old films, even silent films, but Raging Bull couldn't capture my attention. I waited, maybe it's about his descent, spiralling out of control, but no. He wins some fights, loses some, fights a few people, including his brother, a highlight of the film, loses the last fight, retires, goes to jail, then finds himself alone. There's no major catastrophes, minus the fight with his brother, and other than the boxing it's not exciting.There are still good things I wouldn't award an 8 if there weren't. As you've probably heard, De Niro is amazing. After watching several bonus features, I can say he truly becomes the man, Jake LaMotta. He looks like him, fights like him, and probably thinks like him.Joe Pesci is great, and he is almost as volatile as his brother in the film.The use of black and white sets the film apart, and it feels right out of the 40's. However, the story stretches to the 60's, and the black and white feels a bit awkward then. I don't understand why the home movies are in colour. Maybe it the scenes with post-boxing LaMotta used colour, but diluted, an effect of evolution could occur.Lastly, the boxing is awesome. Brutal and visceral, the boxing stands out and makes the scenes outside the ring weaker in comparison. In turn, the editing is great, making the boxing believable.Usually, I can write a review soon after seeing a film. But not Raging Bull. I needed time to assess what just didn't work with me, and after my lacrosse game, when I was sick of working and felt like yelling at everything that just wasn't right, I figured it out. What makes his story so special? What did Jake LaMotta do to attract the attention of De Niro? It's obvious he has psychological problems, but it never feels like he's going to lose it in the film, and just destroy himself. The write-up says he obliterates opponents, and his family and friends, but he doesn't really, only yells and in one extreme scene hits them, but not intensely. This is a realistic film, with few stretched truths, but that could be one of its fatal flaws. By telling it like it happened, we doesn't feel worried about what'll happen, because all the action outside the ring is contained. The one time where it's uncaged, the Jenaro fight, I was finally in awe. That was the only raging I saw in Raging Bull.DeNiro is great, but the character he played is not. We have no sympathy for him. He's not a hero, he's not a villain, he's not an anti-hero, he's just a character. I'm sure there are other people in the world who did lose it. Maybe they deserve a movie about themselves. If Scorcese made a fictionalized version of this story, it could've been more shocking and intense.Lastly, I was misled. The menu used a sweeping orchestral track, but it's never heard again. In fact, other than a few 40's tracks, there was no music. Music could've added an emotional impact to scenes that needed direction, to help us feel the right emotions towards the characters. Especially with the mixed thoughts towards Jake LaMotta, music could've been really beneficial. A film that absolutely ACED the use of music in scenes is Requiem for a Dream. That is just the perfect use of sound to match the pictures on screen.In conclusion, Raging Bull couldn't live up to the hype I had for it. While De Niro and the fights were great, everything else was less than I expected. It's an important film that makes you reflect on yourself, but the intensity I expected just wasn't there.

We have no sympathy for him. He's not a hero, he's not a villain, he's not an anti-hero, he's just a character. I'm sure there are other people in the world who did lose it. Maybe they deserve a movie about themselves. If Scorcese made a fictionalized version of this story, it could've been more shocking and intense.Lastly, I was misled. The menu used a sweeping orchestral track, but it's never heard again. In fact, other than a few 40's tracks, there was no music. Music could've added an emotional impact to scenes that needed direction, to help us feel the right emotions towards the characters. Especially with the mixed thoughts towards Jake LaMotta, music could've been really beneficial. A film that absolutely ACED the use of music in scenes is Requiem for a Dream. That is just the perfect use of sound to match the pictures on screen.In conclusion, Raging Bull couldn't live up to the hype I had for it. While De Niro and the fights were great, everything else was less than I expected. It's an important film that makes you reflect on yourself, but the intensity I expected just wasn't there.

One of the best movies ever; best acting performance ever; robbed of Best Picture; its accolades are intimidating. So when I finally found it on Blu Ray, I gasped out loud. It had found me, and I was going to see the best sports movie ever made.I made myself a snack, customary of any movie for me. I went to my basement, put the disc in my player, and started it up. Instantly, I was engaged the menu, with De Niro warming up alone in the ring, a saddening orchestral melody; I knew this was going to demand my full attention. I ate my entire snack before starting, I didn't want to miss anything. I started the old, fat LaMotta, rhyming to himself. Then BAM! fighting, 20 years earlier. This was it, a milestone in American cinema.Then the disappointment began. There was talking, and small fits of rage, but as the film progressed, I got... bored. Scorsese has never bored me. And the worst part was, I didn't know what was so bad! I've enjoyed old films, even silent films, but Raging Bull couldn't capture my attention. I waited, maybe it's about his descent, spiralling out of control, but no. He wins some fights, loses some, fights a few people, including his brother, a highlight of the film, loses the last fight, retires, goes to jail, then finds himself alone. There's no major catastrophes, minus the fight with his brother, and other than the boxing it's not exciting.There are still good things I wouldn't award an 8 if there weren't. As you've probably heard, De Niro is amazing. After watching several bonus features, I can say he truly becomes the man, Jake LaMotta. He looks like him, fights like him, and probably thinks like him.Joe Pesci is great, and he is almost as volatile as his brother in the film.The use of black and white sets the film apart, and it feels right out of the 40's. However, the story stretches to the 60's, and the black and white feels a bit awkward then. I don't understand why the home movies are in colour. Maybe it the scenes with post-boxing LaMotta used colour, but diluted, an effect of evolution could occur.Lastly, the boxing is awesome. Brutal and visceral, the boxing stands out and makes the scenes outside the ring weaker in comparison. In turn, the editing is great, making the boxing believable.Usually, I can write a review soon after seeing a film. But not Raging Bull. I needed time to assess what just didn't work with me, and after my lacrosse game, when I was sick of working and felt like yelling at everything that just wasn't right, I figured it out.

The rawness of the film style brings a gritty realism to the proceeding. That is certainly true in the case of the vengeance-fueled fantasy that is The Exterminator! Former vet, John Eastland (played very effectively by Robert Ginty), finds life in New York City is even more savage than the jungles of Vietnam, after the near-fatal assault of his best friend causes him to wage his own personal war on the criminal element of the city. Of course, such actions will not go unnoticed.Right from the start, writer\/director James Glickenhaus lets you know just what you are in for with this film, as it begins with a horrific flashback to Eastland's time in 'Nam and sets the tone of the violent displays that will soon follow it. While the special effects are not what one would call high quality, the sheer brutality of what is shown (and often what is not shown) adds a degree of realism that most big budget special effects extravaganzas never could hope to achieve. The beheading scene during the wartime flashback (done masterfully by special effect artist Stan Winston), for example, perfectly illustrates what I mean. It's a gripping moment, due to the harshness and savage way it is presented. Most of the violence is presented in this fashion and it gives the film an edge over many of the like-minded ones that were being produced at the time. They also did a very good job of portraying New York City in the late 70's. The feeling of urban decay, filth, and human misery is almost palpable. Quite simply, you might almost feel the need to bathe after watching this film.As far as the story goes, it's pretty straight-forward. Just your typical revenge style fantasy stuff, which was like a cottage industry back then. There are some bits about the political climate of the time woven into things, as Eastland's actions are not taken well by political figures, who feel his war on crime makes them look inept and weak. But while the politics are in the background, they never really dominate the story. Instead, the focus is kept on Eastland's private war. Most of the performances range from adequate to banal, but then one doesn't watch this kind of cinema expecting Oscar-worthy acting. Robert Ginty was never really a great actor, with this film being his biggest claim to fame, but he truly brought out a great performance here. You can understand and relate to him and why he's doing what he is. I also liked the role of the cop out to stop him (played solidly by Christopher George). However, the romance he strikes up with a nurse (played by Samantha Eggar) doesn't really fit in with the rest of the tone of the film. As a result, it feels tacked on and unnecessary, only serving to take time away from getting more insights into Ginty's character. The ending of the film is, without question, not your typical Hollywood kind and the film only benefits from that.While many might see The Exterminator as just a fairly typical entry into this sub-genre of film, I think some of the smaller bits within it shine through enough that it stands out from most fare of this nature. Within the realm of grindhouse flicks, this one is certainly one of the better ones out there. The rawness and grit of the setting and the downtroddened feeling in the performances, gives the film a legitimacy few others of it's kind ever have. Genre fans would do well to seek it out.

It centers around an immature, twenty year old black man nicknamed Jody (Gibson) who lives with his mom and his fathering two young kids from separate women. His mom gets a new boyfriend named Melvin (Rhames) who is what Jody calls a thug, much to his dismay. More things in Jody's life including friendships, relationships, and family begin to crumble throughout the film when Jody realizes he must grow up.Singleton has successfully made a brutally honest, cut throat, and raw look at the real hood. Not the glorified, Imma-shoot-me-a-thug-and-get-me-a-bitch-cause-this-the-good-life hood. It's almost a documentary style look at what a black area looks like. It goes beyond the stereotypes, and treats these people like real human beings, what they are, not what they are assumed to be.Some blacks do bad, but some try to do right is why I picked up from Baby Boy. Here we have a mama's boy who needs to let his mom live her own life and let himself live his own. It sounds a lot easier than it is. His mom has been in an abusive relationship before, and now Jody does what anyone in his position would, be worried and overprotective.The trailer for Baby Boy suggests that it has a strong comedic side. That it doesn't. It has some brave wit in a few scenes with mild humor popping up, other than that, it's a strange forward piece of drama. There is nothing funny about that plot and it shouldn't have been marketed like a lot of fun. The casting, like in Singleton's previous works, is spot on and worthwhile. We get Tyrese Gibson giving his macho, but softie image. Snoop Dogg, who on the cover appears as Gibson's friend in the film, is far from it probably sporting the toughest and strongest image of mean he's most likely ever done. Rhames' role as the out-of-prison thug is very well captured and powerful just like anticipated. And the rest of the cast supports the leads well and efficient.Baby Boy manages to mix itself in with other hood comedies and concert documentaries on the Black Entertainment Network (BET) most likely to show that there is a reality to everyone's dreams. BET most likely shows the film not only because it is urban inspired, but because it is real. It shouldn't be only aired on the black network, but regular movie networks regularly. Blacks aren't the only people who father babies and live at home in an uninspired way feeding off of their moms. People of all races most likely do it too. The film just focuses around a black family.Ten years old, but still recognized as an effective drama, Baby Boy is a wakeup call to anyone practicing similar behavior. It's time to step up, be a man, and grow up. Life isn't a free ride. Working is hard, but gang life is no way to patch it.

Everything has already been said about Billy Wilder's masterpiece, and I would only be paraphrasing the obvious. But I guess, such dilemmas are sterile ... so let's talk about one of the greatest American films ever, and my gut-feeling on that matter is that the success of Sunset Blvd. is particularly ironical.The principal irony is that one of the greatest American classics is precisely the one that deconstructed the myth of Hollywood. Sunset Blvd. resonates as a cinematic pamphlet against the corruption of minds that governs a quite decadent business. Billy Wilder, was a respected and admired artist, and yet he did the epitome of iconoclast films. Some may say it cost the movie its ticket for the Best Picture winner, which went to the eternal rival All About Eve, another great classic that had the good taste to attack the less glamorous stage world. Sunset Blvd. kills the myth in the pinnacle of its Golden Age, denouncing the way silent stars are treated like old relics, how young starlets are exploited, and how for one or two chosen, many contenders will end up working for B-movies or in peripheral jobs. Hollywood studios are sure a ruthless universe. The word iconoclast holds also a double meaning since it really kills the icons within the Icon. The film had probably shocked, but by deliberately choosing the cynical approach, it was ahead of its time and never lost its relevance ever since, no sir.The second irony is that by deconstructing the same myth, it has prevented it from sinking into oblivion. Let's face it, many movies glorified the Golden Age of Hollywood, yet the only one that had the guts to criticize it, indirectly reminds of how great and irreplaceable these days were. Hollywood couldn't have had a better homage than a movie like Sunset Blvd, as cynical and detached as Joe Gillis' narration sounds, it still speaks Hollywood's true language. And I'd go further, I'm sure Gloria Swanson would have been totally forgotten had this role not been given to her. Through Norma Desmond, Gloria Swanson was immortalized and forever remembered as that actress with the unforgettable look and who portrayed one of the greatest cinematic characters ever. Yes, we know there was Mary Pickford, Lillian Gish, but I'm sure these actresses are more names and faces for movie fans while Gloria Swanson immediately reminds of Sunset Blvd..And this is the third ironic aspect of the film, the movie is believable because almost everyone is playing his own role. Gloria Swanson was indeed a has-been star forgotten by her peers, Erich Von Stroheim a has-been director whose disastrous Queen Kelly, starring &#x96;guess who- Gloria Swanson, derailed both careers. It was that film she was screening to William Holden. The self-reflexive aspect is so well-constructed you need to watch the film a second time, to realize that the characters within the actors were also playing a game. Joe, the struggling screenwriter exploiting Norma's love to have time to get back on the business, and Norma exploiting Joe's need to make her comeback and be with him, and as the band leader of a grotesque masquerade, the butler, Max, Erich Von Strohem who maintains Norma in total denial, literally directing her life. It's all about living in illusions, like the doomed love between a woman alienated by her own image and a man totally disillusioned. Sunset Blvd. Is simply fascinating.But I must add that the story is only one of the many fascinating elements that make the film a classic among the classics. Never had a movie combined such a close to perfect writing with an incredible direction, it's Wilder at the top of his game. When you think of any of the most iconic lines of the film, and it sure is full of them, you immediately associate an atmosphere, a darkness, a face. The cinematography, the direction perfectly convey the creepiness and moral ambiguities of film-noir. Sunset Blvd is a masterpiece for totally objective reasons, one of the rare films, it is impossible to find any flaw in it. From the beginning till the end, the impression, the film leaves on you is its indecent closeness to perfection.And I can't end without mentioning the title Sunset Boulevard which works as a beautiful metaphor of the end of an era. An end forever incarnated by the creepy mansion of Gloria Swanson, this lady with hands and arms that wave as the tentacles that tried in private to take the poor Joe Gillis as a sentimental hostage. And despite all his suaveness, and manly confidence, Joe is just a ghost writer, when Norma is an actress absorbed by her own image, and one man, Max who directs her life, or does he? Who controls these people anyway, they are all guided by their own love for their business ... and the genre, the opening, the setting of the film will respect your intelligence enough not to get you expecting a happy ending. Or was it? In a certain way, Joe was still the ghost writer in the real sense of the word, Norma was still acting, being the heroine of her twisted imagination, facing the cameras, and under the direction of Max who knew the only language that could make Norma Desmond receptive.And this is the beauty of the film, beyond the darkness, it's just an incredible and unforgettable introspection into the world of cinema. I could speak longer about the film, but I think I made my point now, but this is the beauty. It's just me, and the laptop, and those beautiful people out there behind their screens.

It's all about living in illusions, like the doomed love between a woman alienated by her own image and a man totally disillusioned. Sunset Blvd. Is simply fascinating.But I must add that the story is only one of the many fascinating elements that make the film a classic among the classics. Never had a movie combined such a close to perfect writing with an incredible direction, it's Wilder at the top of his game. When you think of any of the most iconic lines of the film, and it sure is full of them, you immediately associate an atmosphere, a darkness, a face. The cinematography, the direction perfectly convey the creepiness and moral ambiguities of film-noir. Sunset Blvd is a masterpiece for totally objective reasons, one of the rare films, it is impossible to find any flaw in it. From the beginning till the end, the impression, the film leaves on you is its indecent closeness to perfection.And I can't end without mentioning the title Sunset Boulevard which works as a beautiful metaphor of the end of an era. An end forever incarnated by the creepy mansion of Gloria Swanson, this lady with hands and arms that wave as the tentacles that tried in private to take the poor Joe Gillis as a sentimental hostage. And despite all his suaveness, and manly confidence, Joe is just a ghost writer, when Norma is an actress absorbed by her own image, and one man, Max who directs her life, or does he? Who controls these people anyway, they are all guided by their own love for their business ... and the genre, the opening, the setting of the film will respect your intelligence enough not to get you expecting a happy ending. Or was it? In a certain way, Joe was still the ghost writer in the real sense of the word, Norma was still acting, being the heroine of her twisted imagination, facing the cameras, and under the direction of Max who knew the only language that could make Norma Desmond receptive.And this is the beauty of the film, beyond the darkness, it's just an incredible and unforgettable introspection into the world of cinema. I could speak longer about the film, but I think I made my point now, but this is the beauty. It's just me, and the laptop, and those beautiful people out there behind their screens. All right, IMDb, I'm ready to submit ... ","genre":"Drama, Film-Noir"},{"date":"13 June 2011","score":"","review":" Once Were Warriors, can be quite difficult to watch. From the beginning you can sense that this is a family with problems and it only becomes more clear as the film goes on.

The mother of the family is Beth, who descends from Maori royalty, she struggles with her life decisions and maintaining the well being of her children. The film has a lot to do with the class system established by Maori culture. Jake is a descendant from slaves and resents his wife's family for not approving of him. This makes him feel like a lesser man which he compensates for by being extremely aggressive. His feelings of inferiority cause him to physically and even sexually dominate his wife in order to preserve his masculinity. The scenes where Jake punches his wife with a closed fist are almost painful to watch because they look very realistic. At first the film shows the family and their flaws which are redeemed by the daughter character, Grace. Grace enjoys reading and writing stories and it's her only escape from her life. She is the only redeemable character for most of the film but this all turns tragic when she commits suicide after being raped by a friend of her father's. In the end, Grace redeems almost all of the characters with her death. Her mother is able to escape Jake's tyranny and go back to her family.

The film has undeniably this 'great classic' feeling that never quite deserts it, but still, somewhere in the middle, it kind of loses its track and becomes an assemblage of cute sketches without the relevance and the power of the first half.The opening of Modern Times announces an excellent satire encapsulating its era. The score almost reminds of Bernard Herrman's Pscyho music, something virtually thrilling and disturbing. Indeed, the film opens with a powerful visual metaphor, sheep running to the slaughterhouse. The image directly dissolves to workers in the subway going to factory. We're far from the laughs and tears of City Lights or The Kid, Chaplin shows that he's not just a slapstick director, there's an engaged heart beating, and the movie is not just made for laughs. It's Chaplin's more mature film before The Great Dictator and only for that accomplishment, it deserves respect.And the first part doesn't disappoint this feeling. It's well crafted, with a sort of perfectionism a la Metropolis, combined with an incredible social commentary on the role of the workers as human sheep in the 'Industrial New Order' &#x85; and it's just so darn funny. The part is full of iconic moments like the working chain mocking the secondary effects of the Taylorism, the eating machine, and the famous breakdown, a symbol of the alienation of a man trapped in his own condition. The iconic image of Chaplin eaten up by the whizzing gears is the perfect symbol of a man who's become part of the industrial machine. He's a piece that can be replaced any time. Chaplin clearly denounces the dehumanizing effect of industrialization when even the most basic actions must be ruled by a mechanic system, an absurdity reaching its paroxysm with the eating-machine &#x85; Chaplin even denounces the way denunciation is handled. In the scene where he was waving what seemed to be a red flag fallen from a truck, which was mistakenly taken as a protest march, a bunch of workers join him inviting the Police to put them to jail. The jail sequence is full of amusing gags, among which the one where after accidentally putting nose-powder in his plate, in an epic fight scene, Chaplin prevents prisoners from escaping and the jail becomes a haven of safety. The film doesn't just play on slapstick, there's a lot of irony going especially when, as a free man, Chaplin wants to stay, underlining the idea, that in those days, prisons at least guaranteed a roof, and regular food. The efforts, Chaplin, as the Tramp, put to go back to jail are not only hilarious but very eloquent about these hard days. A hardship endured by the heroine of the film, the Gamin.There's no Chaplin's story without romantic subplot, without the heart and the tears, and the Gamin part worked quite well. Paulette Goddard has such energy, dedication to her family, such vivacity sparkling in her eyes that Modern Times opens ours to the people's routine with the right mix of pathos and optimism. And the death of the father, and the social workers taking the orphans was a touching reminiscence of Chaplin's Kid. Of course, there would be no doubt, the Gamin and the Tramp would end up together. But when they meet, something happens, it's like the romantic aspect submerged the social commentary, and maybe Chaplin meant it as a pause, but it's certainly not the highlight of the film.It happened twice so I don't think it's a coincidence if I didn't enjoy the dreamy parts, or the rediscovery of childhood's joy in the department store. The movie could have made it with the same length than The Kid and be still powerful. I also think the part where he went back to the factory was useless, we've had enough of the factory and it was perfect, why bringing back the same stuff? Chaplin is my favorite director so I must be sincere, especially since I appreciate the film, and that it doesn't end on a wrong note. Anyway, as someone said, every film should feature at least three memorable moments, in Modern Times, there was the factory sequence, but it needed something else to lurch it into Pop Culture forever, among the greatest classics, and this was the Restaurant scene, Garbo laughs! for the first time in Ninotchka, now, Chaplin speaks! Questioning the relevance of this scene in Modern Times would be pointless, and this reinforces my disliking of the previous scenes, which could have worked, had they been funnier. But the restaurant part still remains as one of the most enjoyable moments from any comedic film, especially when you know what will happen, when Chaplin will sing his most memorable song. It's gibberish, but the sound, the music, will become Chaplin's signature. Everything was perfect; the timing, the build-up and Paulette Goddard, as beautiful as ever, finally enchanting the screen without her dirty clothes, she was Cinderella in the ball, and her little seconds of dancing were pure beauty in motion. And Chaplin's meaningless lyrics still sound as the hymn of an era and the pride that conceding words doesn't mean making them intelligible. Chaplin knew how to make his scenes universally appealing and this one is stuck in memories forever.And the third last memorable moment comes at the end, where the Tramp and the Gamin, after so many misadventures walk into the sunset for a better future, with a shining smile in their face &#x85; this is Chaplin reminding us that it's still about optimism, about laugh and joy.

Tamahori shows his true mastery of the cinematic language in this film; it's almost hard to believe that the man that directed Once Were Warriors is the same man who later on directed Die Another Day, and XXX The State of the Union. Though gratuitous violence may abound in his other films, nothing about any of the violent scenes in this film can be called superfluous. Though the beginning of the film seems bright, as the audience is further exposed to the life of the Heke family, a sense of hopelessness abounds. The overarching theme in this film is sacrifice and self-restraint. Both parents of the Heke family, Jake and Beth, are unwilling to sacrifice their own personal interests for the sake of the future generation, their children. Beth refuses to restrain her husband from holding a party the night before their son's trial, and even goes so far as joining the party. Beth also refuses to restrain herself from giving into her love for her husband, and consistently chooses to trap herself and her children in a dangerous household instead of choosing the more logical choice of leaving for better opportunities. Jake's lack of sacrifice is more physical than Beth's, as he is unable to restrain himself from acting violently when he is angry, and also refuses to treat the role of fatherhood with the same sense of responsibility that is common to most cultures. Instead of immediately looking for work and a way to pay for the possibility of a better life for his family, Jake decides to take advantage of New Zealand's generous welfare system. Jake is unable to sacrifice his carefree life to provide for the future of his family, and he is unable to sacrifice the alcohol that keeps him tied to the bar instead of his family. The lack of education in the slums is perhaps the most startling matter, as education seems to be the only plausible solution to the ills of the Maori slums. The Hekes' oldest daughter, Grace, is the only character that presents a glimmer of hope for the future, due to the fact that she is literate and interested in pursuing further education and art, beyond the borders of the slums. Of course, the only way for the rest of the Heke family to understand that they should poisonous atmosphere of the slums is for one of the family members to sacrifice their own interests to allow others to pursue a better future. Instead of parental sacrifice however, Grace's suicide after she is raped by her father's close friend, provides the catalyst for change. Once Were Warriors serves as an educational catalyst as well, promoting awareness of the harsh realities of a world without education, self-sacrifice, or restraint. Without the capability of pushing one own's immediate desires aside, the foundation for a better future can never be created. The way that Tamahori plays with the audience's expectations and his in-your-face directorial style, matched with an incredibly enticing storyline is what makes this film great. The film's message is both specific to one area of the world, and universal in its scope. I can honestly say that this film is now one of my favorite movies, though it is not for the faint of heart, or those that choose to believe that ignorance is bliss.

Hitchcock, after a career that spanned five decades, only 8 years before he would say goodbye to us, he made what I consider his masterpiece. Yes, yes, I see, where you're coming from, where do you put Psycho, North by Northwest, Vertigo, where are the 50's, the 40's, how could this movie possibly be his masterpiece? Well, first I had the chance to watch all the classic Hitch films, you know the big ones, that enriched the list of the American Film Institute, IMDb Top 250 and all prestigious cinematic websites, and the night I discovered Frenzy, I was thrilled, shocked, amused, captivated, transported, I had the whole Hitch formula in one film, one single film, one single word &#x85; that couldn't have encapsulated the Hitchcockian style any better. It's quite simple, if I had to pick one movie to show the Hitchcock style, it would be Frenzy. In the post-Birds period that could have lead to think that Hitchcock was losing his touch, the Master of Shock and Suspense gets back to his roots. Literally, since it's set in London, which almost concludes the fascinating arc of his glorious filmography. Even the score of the film has a little something cheerful when the movie starts, as if Britain was welcoming back Hitch in 1972. 1972 indeed, Grace Kelly was Princess Grace of Monaco, Jimmy Stewart and Cary Grant were on their 60's, and Hitchcock was 73 and had nothing to prove, as I like to say, yet, he brought to us one of his greatest thrillers, centered around one sordid serial killer story, the man with the necktie. The novel was adapted by Anthony Schafner, Sleuth's screenwriter, who made the perfect ingredient so the Master could cook us a delicious plate, nothing to do with the kind of uneatable disasters Mrs Oxford was serving to her poor husband. Some would say Hitchcock always tells the same story a man wrongfully accused of a murder, or to be another one, but whatever you expect, this film will surprise you. It contains all the elements used in Hitchcock films, memorable murders' sequences, suspicion and wrong identity, a creepy but charismatic villain, Robert Rusk, played by the admirable Barry Foster, and a surprising twist, but the same story handled by another director could have failed. Take, the first murder sequence, rarely has a Hitch moment been so graphic and violent, and I mean it, Hitchchock despite his age, knew that the era allowed him to be more audacious. And the moment where the victim realizes that it's not just a rape, as if her lack of resistance was only meant not to worsen the situation, we can feel her absolute fear, and I literally suffocated when she was being strangled. And I literally jumped with the vision of the twisted tongue, and then I said to myself  Why you, Hitch, you &#x85; Total respect! Hitch still got it. All you need to remember a crime is one shot ... and what a shot!But the scene is so shocking and unforgettable that the second crime must 'must keep it up'. Again Hitch finds the parade helped by a clever trick in the script. As we follow Rusk with his next victim walking from the street to his apartment, all he says is  You're my type of woman then the door is closed and we say good-bye to Babs, while the camera slowly goes downstairs and get off the house and we find ourselves back in a busy street. The impact is powerful and leaves us with shudders, but still the murder wouldn't have been memorable without the little extra pinch of pure Hitchcockian Black Humor. Rusk realizing that his diamond brooch probably stayed in the hand of his victim gets back to the truck where he previously put her in a potatoes bag. The whole 'truck' sequence where he tries to gets the pin back is thrilling as we put ourselves in the evil man's shoes and funny because it's satisfying to see him enduring this posthumous revenge, especially the foot of the corpse hitting him in the face. And we get to see the face of the victim, which is one of Frenzy's trademarks, they're creepy and funny in a sort of unconventional way.But besides the murders, the crimes, the power of the film relies on the shoulders of the tragically unlucky Dick Blaney whom everything accuse, but the handsome Jon Finch puts so much energy in his role, we immediately root for him. And there is the investigation of the sympathetic Chief Oxford punctuated with so many indigestible marital dinners. It works as a running gag until a crucial scene where the Chief admits that there's something fishy in this affair. This is an important element as it helps to show how the Chief started to have suspicion in this open-and-shut case. The film quickly concludes when after having escaped, Blaney comes to kill Rusk and find himself between another corpse and Oxford, as to condemn himself when he could have been acquitted. Blaney is quite an unlucky character. But one irony is replaced by another, when Rusk enters his house with the trunk to hide his victim in. What's the meaning of all that? That you can't escape your nature, one is a killer, one is unlucky &#x85; but ultimately, the one who has the last word is Hitch justice is done.It quite ends abruptly but the ending is perfect with the four major protagonists of the film, the policeman, the wrongfully accused man, the killer, and the victim &#x85; an anonymous victim this time, but who can forget this tongue coming out of her mouth, as if she way telling Dick Gotcha!.

I've heard it was spectacular and decided to give it a whirl.It's not the worst I've ever seen, oh no. But definitely one of the most disappointing movies I've seen.First of all, Gene Kelly wasn't my favorite in SITR (I prefer Donald O'Connor). But I still thought he was alright. But he wasn't nearly as good in AAIP. His singing is okay here and there. But he doesn't do anything that makes me stare with wide eyes. I've always thought he was overrated. Not bad. But definitely overrated. And I didn't like his character much in this one, either. Also, his chemistry with Leslie Caron is not very believable, in my opinion.Speaking of Leslie, this was her first film. So I understand how she might be uncomfortable. But, am I the only one who doesn't think she's that pretty in this one? I thought she was fabulous in Gigi (1958). She was gorgeous and very talented in that one. But this one, she was missing something. But it was fun to watch her dance on pointe.Kelly's pal, Oscar Levant, is supposed to be the comic relief. Well, he wasn't at all comical, or at all a relief, for that matter. I loved his piano playing and I hope to be as good as him someday. But he was about as humorous as a brick and not a good actor, either. If you want a real good Gene Kelly pal, watch Donald O'Connor in SITR.

I strongly believe that if you don't think you can provide your children with an ideal life in terms of emotional caress and love then you should not have brought them into this world.

With his total loss of short term memory, he can't hang on to the clues he finds.The movie shows us Leonard's story from end to beginning so it's easy to get caught up in the strange loops of the narrative. This technique is not just a gimmick. The inverted sequence drives the story in ways that make events flow in a way we can follow, but also hits us with sudden ambushes. Memento puts us inside the mind of a man whose mind can't work right. The experience is strange and disorienting, rare and uncomfortable.The best illustration of this occurs some way through the movie. We are abruptly cut to a junk yard, and we hear Leonard thinking to himself Am I chasing him? Or is he chasing me? And at this point, we don't know. Despite everything we've seen and heard, and figured out so far, we have NO idea. There is simply no way to make it fit in. And no time to sort it out. We are very much in Leonard's skin.Even if told in a normal sequence, Memento has layers beyond the story line. Beyond the story line about Leonard's mission, we see how life delivers rough justice What happens to Leonard is rough justice for what he did to someone who suffers from the same memory loss. The stranger we see Leonard murder at the beginning of the movie is receiving severe judgment for his crimes. Also, everyone who interacts with Leonard takes advantage as soon as they discover his shortcoming. A pretty dark take on human nature.in medias res starting the story in the middle is an effective way to tell a story. Memento may begin at the end, but it constantly keeps us in the middle of things. The rare experience it provides is good reason to see it. It's also the reason it's not a big commercial success. Watching Memento again, you can't re-experience what you experience seeing it the first time, and you may find the initial experience so disconcerting you don't recognize that that's the payoff. I'm glad I rented it. It gave me a rare, disturbing experience that I couldn't recapture.

(Beaches and Terms of Endearment come to mind.) Schindler's List is different. It matters. The realism portrayed is frightening. You're not watching a film about the horrors of the Holocaust, you're witnessing the horrors of the Holocaust. Decent people, people just trying to make a living like you and me, put into such a devastating position for no fault of there own. And a man, a Nazi of all people, who has a virtue his peers seem to be lacking compassion. But, unlike many weaker efforts to exploit human tragedy, the protagonist (Oskar Schindler)is initially set on cashing in on the force labor by the Jews he brings to his factory. Over the story, his character develops more and more feelings for his Jewish subjects. He reaches the point where they aren't Jewish workers, but fellow human beings.In that, Schindler's List is a very human story. A film that every single human being on the face of the planet should sit through, not for entertainment, but to get a first person perspective to the horrors man is capable of committing on each other.

Ghost in the Shell pushes a lot of philosophy, and sadly when you're stuck with a dubbed version streaming on Netflix, the wooden expression behind the dialogue fails to truly communicate these sophisticated ideas. The artistic and almost meditative direction of Mamoru Oshii comes across without interference from cultural boundaries, but Ghost in the Shell is tough to follow from the American perspective and its potential for poignancy shut out thanks to bad voice acting and general language translation.As far as how one would animate a futuristic film steeped in technological references and with a story populated by cyborgs, Oshii quite honestly nails it. Masamune Shirow's manga clearly focused on the question of what makes us human and Oshii's direction so perfectly captures the combination of human and mechanical elements. From the captivating title sequence as we see the birth of our hero, Kusanagi, there's an immediately striking contrast and blend of natural and manufactured beauty. Almost all the settings and directorial choices reflect that balance as well.Kusanagi is a cyborg police officer in a future where most people's brains and souls or ghosts exist in mechanical bodies. She and her unit are on the case of a renowned hacker called The Puppet Master, who ultimately challenges what she believes in. I wish I could explain with any depth, but most of it was lost on me.Kusanagi draws you in as a cyborg protagonist. Oshii paints her as this fragile doll of sorts, with lingering shots expressive of deep thought which we might not normally believe a cyborg capable. Although her behavior outside of that deep dialogue is mostly mechanical, we care for her rather instantly.She can also kick some ass, which is important in this film. The action is much grittier than usual anime fare but with the same artistic flair you'd expect from the genre.Occasionally some long scenes without dialogue and just music come into the picture to allow focus on the well-animated world of Section 9. The pause doesn't help matters of focus, but it does highlight the undeniable strengths of the film the technical aspects and the animation.I would honestly have to watch this film again to understand it, so perhaps a higher score would come with a second viewing as it warrants this many stars on art and direction alone.~Steven CVisit my site at http\/\/moviemusereviews.com ","genre":null},{"date":"13 June 2011","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Some films lose something in translation.
