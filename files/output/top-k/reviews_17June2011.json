Flying Chaplin will seem to teleport in one really bad cut.Also, the music is not fitting at all. Tense music plays during sad scenes, quiet music plays during chases, it doesn't help the atmosphere. There are some good scenes though, like the fight and the window scam. There's just not enough of them. Also the end is too quick and abrupt.

It's a heist movie, but a special kind of heist movie. There are no gritty stand-offs; this is a smart, tell-it-like-it-was kind of film, and it can seems a little silly at times. That's because it actually was silly at times. The summary almost reads off like the start of a joke 'So a gay man walks into a bank...' In real life, Sonny (real name John) robbed a bank to pay for his lover's sex change operation. I won't spoil anymore, because spoiling the truth is spoiling the movie. The direction is perfect. The tone of the film is almost light-hearted Sonny fumbles his gun, one crook cracks... it reminds me of Goodfellas in a sense that while not being funny, you can't help but smile.A big part of this is Sonny. Al Pacino, in one of his best (unfortunately underrated) roles, play the rookie bank robber AMAZINGLY. When you look at great actors, it's easy to say Oh yeah, he is the character, he's real good but here it's incredible. His eyes, facial expressions, the way he walks and talks, its an absolute sell. You feel for him, all he wants is to help someone he loves but things just went to #%@*. He's the best part of the film. Everyone else does their job, but are unfortunately in the same movie as Al Pacino. Sal isn't a lovable guy, he's kind of dumb (Wyoming) and a follower. He could've been fleshed out a little more.One thing of interest is the crowd. If you are like me and like to know NOTHING going into your films, skip this paragraph. If you've done even a little reading, you know Sonny is gay. I did not, which is why it was a little surprising, but then not he subtly conveys it throughout the film. I found it interesting to see the crowd's love of Sonny before the reveal, including the small things like flipping off the officers, as well as cheering for him. But after they learn, there's more subtle movements you can here He's a queer? in an offensive tone, as well as see members of the crowd doing a package-grab gesture in the background as Sonny pats down the FBI agent.

Jesus H, I can't believe all the apparently serious reviews praising this film. What the hell are you people smoking? What a laughably bad movie this is...and I don't care what side of the religious line you fall on.I missed the first few minutes of the movie, and came in on the part where Mimi has just finished scrubbing the nasty Duchovny cooties off her. The film plods along until she gets the idea to go camping in the desert. Mimi kills her kid to send her to heaven, rather than waiting for the rapture that's supposedly just around the corner anyway, and then gets PO'd at God. The other characters of the movie are all as idiotic acting; I was especially bemused by the cop's character. Some dirty crazy woman has just admitted to killing her kid, and the cops only reaction is to talk about religion? Give me a f*****g break.After he finally is recalled to his duty and drags this psycho to jail, everyone there has also drank the Kool-aid. The part that made me laugh out loud? The TV in the jail breaks away from regular programming and begins televising the rapture! The cop & the psycho take a motorcycle cruise and meet up with the 4 horsemen on a trail ride. Then she tells God to go to hell, the end.I originally gave the movie 1 star (because I couldn't rate it 0 stars). But then reconsidered and give it 2 stars, because David Duchovny was surprisingly hot in the beginning, what with all the naked chest \/ long hair action going on. Too bad that part was so short.As an atheist maybe I'm lacking the necessary frame of mind to view films with religious content. I guess I just have trouble suspending my disbelief long enough to get caught up in these types of films; I instead find myself squirming at the zealotry. Ugh. Give me a science-based movie any day.
