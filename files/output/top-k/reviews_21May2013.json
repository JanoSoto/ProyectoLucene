I love this movie because it's dramatic and inspiring but also because it's not utterly swamped down with swells of dramatic music. In fact, the whole time Hanks's character is on the island, there is no music, and this actually has a profound and unique effect. Don't get me wrong, I love a good soundtrack, but sometimes I think that there is definite overkill with music in scenes that don't necessarily need it.I loved seeing the slow, forced transformation of Hanks's character throughout the movie. He went from sort of chubby, overworked and neglectful of his health to this hardened survivor with a huge, bushy beard. He even has to knock his own abscessed tooth out on his own, when back home he had the opportunity to go to the dentist and have painkillers and do it the easy way.The only spot where some people feel this movie fell down was the ending, where Hanks's character makes it back to the US and his true love. But to be honest I think the ending was great. I don't believe it was an overdone Hollywood ending, and it also gave me hope for Hanks's character's future. It helps that he didn't get back with his love, because she had moved on with a family of her own. I actually found it quite wrenching.All in all, I think this is a really well done movie.

And that is due largely in part to its acting performances. Never would I have thought I would ever feel tension just from the use of dialogue, but '12 Angry Men' proved me wrong showing that if you have a good plot and a good script, then you can make a quality film without the use of large sets, car chases, gun shots, and beautiful scenery shots.There was never one moment in this film where I was not paying attention. One reason I can give for this is the distinctiveness of each and every character. What I love is how every juror is different from one another hailing from many different backgrounds. Just listening to these guys talk made me want to get to know everyone of them and what their motives were and how it would affect the outcome of the story. As the story progresses, you get more and more immersed as things start to get tense and personal in situation in which extreme rationalization is required in using reasonable doubt.What also makes this film rewarding is that you feel like one of the jurors and it makes you want to think just as hard as they're thinking about the case. There are twists and turns here and this is not a simple case to analyze when everything is not pure black and white. When we're only presented with very few details, we can only look to the unseen details that could give us a strong reason to doubt a person(s)' accusations. This is a story that is universal and how reasonable doubt must be taken into all accounts when there is blurred line between who is right or wrong and who is good or bad.

Otherwise, this film has nothing special to offer. The story never even tries to be thought-provoking or inspiring. The plot is paper-thin, as a murderer comes to town and kills 3 random teens for no reason. The film is very overt that there is absolutely no reason; the killer is nothing but a vehicle for overwrought suspense.There truly is a lack of suspense here. Most of the movie features the average main characters going about their boring lives and occasionally noticing Michael Myers appearing on a street corner, then disappearing. This could be an evocative and tantalizing effect, but each of Michael's surprise appearances are extremely predictable and usually accompanied by a melodramatic, campy musical cue.The murder scenes are quaint, with no thrill or shock; at best they give a glimpse into '70s filmmaking style.The worst aspect, though, was in most of the character interactions. Audiences want an exciting thriller from Halloween, but a ridiculous amount of the movie consists of bland, mildly annoying teenagers chatting mindlessly. I suppose this material is an attempt at realism, but when it contributes nothing to plot, meaning or character arcs, it's just an insulting waste of the audience's time.As for good points, the film is competently executed (with no glaring faults but also no outstanding cinematography), and the character of Dr. Loomis had the potential to be interesting or entertaining. Unfortunately these aspects are nowhere near enough to complete the movie.If you want to check out a real museum piece, take a look at Halloween.

Serpico is a difficult film to watch at times precisely because of the protagonist's stalwart decision making and integral resolve to do the right thing. Clearly Serpico is in the right, that is difficult to contest; he is facing down system wide corruption within a police force that spurs crime for kickbacks. Pacino beautifully and timelessly portrays an aspiring young police officer that because of his decision to resist, transforms from being a happy, fancy free, and in love man into a very embittered albeit resolved loner and vanguard.Serpico takes on extreme bitterness and personal risk for the sake of changing a corrupt system, for being in the right and being a person with the fortitude to affect change.At the time of the film's release in 1973, folks throughout the world in the wake of the 68' movement learned first hand how difficult and personally challenging resistance could be. Many of those actors, like Serpico, acted ethically but many (and I believe Serpico's fictional character) did not anticipate the true costs of fighting a corrupt system alone. While systemic problems endured, loved ones continued to go uncared for, pollution mounted, and cities crumbled (evident in the film's gritty New York setting that was a key aesthetic of 1970s malaise -think Taxi Driver or Mean Streets for more examples from film).The entire film, I waited for the moment I knew would never come. Although it is easy to pass by, Serpico really had two ethical choices the path he chooses in fighting corruption, and the path of leaving the police force in exchange for his safety and happiness.Not only Serpico but those that love him, his friends, his family, and (perhaps most importantly) the women in his life are forced to suffer with him as he chooses the path of ethical purity.After nearly losing his life, Serpico, in a key moment of painful contemplation while he sits up in his hospital bed, rejects the prized detectives badge. In his testimony before the grand jury, Serpico states beautifully that fighting corruption requires not only commissioners but ALSO police officers to undertake change.Although I know it was based on a true story, I like to think that Pacino's character found a way to make the most out of having survived, perhaps going back to the woman he loves in all but word.Fantastic wishful thinking aside, what we are left with is a beautiful portrayal, while though historic, makes timeless commentary on what it means to be moral in an immoral world.

'Double Indemnity' is all these things that play a part in blindly falling in love with someone, without knowing that person is acting purely on lustful desires. Once the movie begins and we are introduced to our main character, we are already aware things have taken a bad turn, but we just don't know how bad. All we know is that things are not looking good as our character is about to begin his confession.We cannot help, but feel pity for Neff, but I think we can all agree that this was a lot of stupidity on his part for not using his brain to investigate things further before he went in too deep. This is an engrossing story and as the story unfolds, many layers of the mystery begin to peel off, unveiling one shocking revelation after the next. With each twist and turn, we can feel our insides twisting more and more as the big picture starts to show revealing the disturbing truth.This has everything I love about the film noir genre. From the witty dialogue delivered to its dark tone, its just all in all, a well thought out plot that is bound to cast a spell on its viewer and hold her or his attention until the end.

As long as the movie is good, then I can tolerate the length, but I have then never watched a movie as long as 'Once Upon a Time in America' and thought of it then was pretty daunting.And to my surprise, every scene in 'Once Upon a Time in America' was able to do just that all the while making me forget about its long length. Every performance by the actors is perfect, especially Robert De Niro performance as Noodles. The reason why this man is my favorite actor of all time is the way every performance he does is intense and brooding, but from different perspectives from completely different characters from different worlds.Here, he is a character that will make you sympathize with him and will also alienate you with disgust. Noodles is a fascinating character that makes me feel a lot of ambivalence. What is amazing is seeing the ugly world through the eyes of a gangster and seeing their flawed, but existing humanity. This is a bit reminiscent of The Godfather in that it shows the more personal side of a gangster's life, but this is a story that differs a lot of The Godfather and is a standalone story.And not only that, but this is no cops and robbers shoot 'em up type story. There is actually a lot of beauty conveyed in its approach and it is also evident in its visuals that slow the movie down to let the viewer feel immersed in its opium drenched atmosphere. There are moments of reflection and moments of repulsion that occurs during the moments where we don't even expect it. Even the sweetest, almost innocent moments we expect to blossom becomes overshadowed by the characters' criminal nature.And that is the story of 'Once Upon a Time in America' of how darkness can shroud the light at the end of the tunnel if we become corrupted by evil.

But the full commitment of its principals on both sides of the camera makes this riveting all the same.Chicago in 1930 is a city at war. A gang boss named Al Capone (Robert De Niro) holds court in a barber chair, explaining he is only supplying a need. What is bootlegging? On a boat, it's bootlegging. On Lake Shore Drive, it's hospitality. But Prohibition is the law of the land, and when Capone's ways of breaking that law include blowing up buildings and killing little girls, it's time for U. S. Treasury Agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) to step in.Director Brian De Palma was slumming when he made this film, according to a DVD documentary. Maybe that was the secret; he didn't press so hard. The film exists as a series of set pieces, much like other De Palma films, and the attention to stylistic visuals and atmospherics are there. But this time he lets the story breathe a bit more, giving you something to care about or laugh at between what amounts to an exhausting amount of carnage.How bloody is this film? There's one cast member listed in the credits as Gunned Head. Good luck finding him, too.Iconography is everything in De Palma films. Here he not only quotes from other directors, but develops some iconography of his own, like a famous moment when Capone expounds at length about his love for baseball and another when Ness is told about The Chicago Way by an older cop named Malone (Sean Connery) He sends one of yours to the hospital, you sent one of his to the morgue. One shootout scene in a railroad terminal managed to both quote a famous film (The Battleship Potemkin) and become uniquely famous on its own.The body count is matched only by the cliché count. Every pavement is slick with rain. A dying man imparts important information to a friend with his last breath. A couple of bottles happen to be standing on a building ledge just so they can explode in sequence in the middle of a gun battle. Ness actually tells someone he'll see Capone in hell.Many reviewers here criticize Kevin Costner as Ness. Actually, I think some of them criticize Costner as Costner, which would be fine with me except for the fact he's very good here playing Ness as unblinking straight arrow with a touch of vulnerability. Connery won an Oscar for his role here, and while he's quite good, I think Costner delivers a better performance. He has to stand up to the star power of both Connery and De Niro and does so, allowing them the big moments their characters require but keeping himself at the center throughout. I even like Costner's smaller moments here, like eating a sandwich and trying to make small talk with a young cop during a stakeout.I do wonder why screenwriter David Mamet has him talking like a robot at times, but I like how Mamet keeps the story focused on the action, which De Palma supplies brilliantly. There's some questioning of the wisdom of cracking down on something as uncontrollable as people drinking booze, and even a darker thread involving Ness's being tempted to pursue extra-legal methods in pursuit of his aims. Still, when you have such wonderful bad guys as De Niro's Capone and Billy Drago's ultra-creepy button man Frank Nitti, it's hard to stop and ponder the deeper philosophy at work, which is part of The Untouchables' strength. You just want to see these guys die nasty.Also great in this movie is the music by Ennio Morricone, which stirs you up before you see a single character and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end. Yes, there's something simplistic at the heart of The Untouchables, but it works so well I was left wondering if that stripped-down quality isn't the secret of its success.

Actually, I think some of them criticize Costner as Costner, which would be fine with me except for the fact he's very good here playing Ness as unblinking straight arrow with a touch of vulnerability. Connery won an Oscar for his role here, and while he's quite good, I think Costner delivers a better performance. He has to stand up to the star power of both Connery and De Niro and does so, allowing them the big moments their characters require but keeping himself at the center throughout. I even like Costner's smaller moments here, like eating a sandwich and trying to make small talk with a young cop during a stakeout.I do wonder why screenwriter David Mamet has him talking like a robot at times, but I like how Mamet keeps the story focused on the action, which De Palma supplies brilliantly. There's some questioning of the wisdom of cracking down on something as uncontrollable as people drinking booze, and even a darker thread involving Ness's being tempted to pursue extra-legal methods in pursuit of his aims. Still, when you have such wonderful bad guys as De Niro's Capone and Billy Drago's ultra-creepy button man Frank Nitti, it's hard to stop and ponder the deeper philosophy at work, which is part of The Untouchables' strength. You just want to see these guys die nasty.Also great in this movie is the music by Ennio Morricone, which stirs you up before you see a single character and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end. Yes, there's something simplistic at the heart of The Untouchables, but it works so well I was left wondering if that stripped-down quality isn't the secret of its success.

Jim Varney was an incredibly talented actor, and his Ernest character was his way of taking a break from more serious pursuits. It's rare today to find even a Christmas movie that's not filled with bad language, sexual innuendo, and other filth- but every Ernest movie is 100% clean, family-friendly fun. As an example I cite the character in this movie (forget his or the actor's name, it's been ages) who used to host a children's show, but got a part in a movie and couldn't bring himself to say a certain line with a bad word, because he couldn't stand to think of the children hearing him say it. That wasn't just that character's attitude, it was Jim Varney's as well. Varney was a chain smoker- however he would never light up if there was a child around. And he refused to use foul language. I think Varney also made a nod to the state of movies with his Mr. Apopka the snake handler character in this movie- That's all these Hollywood folk want. Poison! Speaking of characters, Jim's various personifications always had me rolling on the floor. In this movie the best was definitely the old lady. Anyway, I think any viewer with children who is looking for some clean, funny movies for the kids, would do well to rent this one or any of the Ernest movies.

Thanks largely in part to a script that was positively audacious in its deliberate loading the film of every outdated sci-fi idea in the book, aided and abetted by an incredible cast. The people in this film are all utterly believable and ground the film in a way that lesser attention to the acting would not have done.
