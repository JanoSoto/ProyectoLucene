One day while Mark and his younger brother Ricky are having a cigarette in the woods, a fat sweaty man parks his car there and starts letting car exhaust flow into the car. When Mark tries to unhook it, the man shoves him into the car and reveals some dark secrets. After Mark manages to escape, the man shoots himself.Once the police investigation begins, Mark doesn't tell everything that happened, but the police are suspicious. Meanwhile, prosecutor Roy Foltrigg (Tommy Lee Jones) hopes to use Mark's hidden information to bring down a New Orleans mafioso (Anthony LaPaglia), while Mark is tired of getting questioned, and so he hires novice lawyer Reggie Love (Susan Sarandon), who has been having to deal with her own demons.I found the really effective scenes to be the dialog between Foltrigg and Love, as they try their legal skills against each other. It was also good to show how the ordeal affects Mark's family - especially his overworked mom (Mary-Louise Parker) - but the interactions between the attorneys really give the movie its strength. Sarandon's role earned her a Best Actress nomination, and she won the following year for Dead Man Walking. Too bad that Brad Renfro died of a drug overdose really young (his death got overshadowed by Heath Ledger's death a few days later).OK, so we could be cynical and ask how the mafioso immediately figured that his lawyer spilled the beans, or why Mark and Reggie do what they do in New Orleans.

It's really one of the best, most thought-provoking films of the 1990s. It's filled with ideas and sharp observations from the first scene to the last. At the beginning, when D-Fens is stuck in traffic, you really get to feel how stressful and numbing the situation is for him. The scene is shot in an unusual way, with a close focus on what's surrounding his small car. The last important scene is an emotional tour-de-force. Michael Douglas gives one of his best performances as William D-Fens Foster, a working class hero. He just wants to get home to see his family, but the ills of a big American city keep getting in his way. These confrontations are thrilling, but also funny in a black comedy kind of way. Douglas is really the heart of the film. Robert Duvall, however, is also impressive as Sergeant Martin Prendergast. His character is a reasonable man but with problems of his own. He has it better than D-Fens. Still, in a way he understands what D-Fens is going through. Falling Down reminded me of Come And See (1985), a great war film. It's structured just like that film, and just like that film it has a powerful ending. Maybe Falling Down was influenced by Come And See. Falling Down is one of several Hollywood films of the late 1980s and early 1990s that fall under the white man as a victim category. It's undoubtedly the best of them. In addition to the action it features beautiful cinematography. The neighborhoods that D-Fens passes through aren't exactly pretty, but they're photographed very well, and Andrzej Bartkowiak captures the look of a hot day perfectly. One of my favorite things about the film is that it has that early 1990s Hollywood look. I guess this is because of the cameras that were used at that time.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"29 July 2010","score":"","review":" Over the years there have been a number of films about the death penalty, nearly all of which, at least in recent years, have taken an anti-death penalty stance, possibly because the concept of deterrence, which is a key element of the pro-death penalty case, is something not easily dramatised on screen. The one exception is perhaps Just Cause (also from 1995), which starts off as a standard liberal anti-capital punishment drama and then appears to reverse its stance, probably because the plot hangs on a silly-clever twist which the scriptwriter threw in without caring that it negated the ideological stance he had taken at the beginning of the film. How one reacts to films of this nature probably depends to some extent on one's own attitude to the death penalty, yet although I am personally (for various reasons) opposed to capital punishment I frequently find them unsatisfactory or unconvincing. Probably the best is The Birdman of Alcatraz, which approaches the question from an oblique angle by showing that even the most hardened murderer is capable of reform, followed by a few reconstructions of real-life miscarriages of justice, notably Ten Rillington Place which told the story of Timothy Evans and John Christie. Many of the others, however, simply proceed from the assumption that capital punishment is barbaric. This has never struck me as a valid argument, merely an arrogant assumption of moral superiority over one's opponents in the debate and a claim that because of their supposed moral inferiority their arguments are not worthy of serious consideration. Nobody has ever been converted from one viewpoint to another simply by calling them a barbarian. Given that Dead Man Walking was directed by Tim Robbins, one of Hollywood's most prominent liberals, and starred his equally liberal long-term partner Susan Sarandon, I was expecting it to be another piece of moral grandstanding. Instead it takes a rather more subtle look at the moral issues involved. It is based upon the writings of Sister Helen Prejean, a Roman Catholic nun and anti-death penalty activist who appears as one of the two main characters. The other is Matthew Poncelet, a Louisiana death row prisoner who has been sentenced to death for the murder of a teenage couple and who asks Sister Helen to help him with his final appeal. When this is turned down, he asks her to be his spiritual adviser in the days leading up to his execution. Given his own political convictions, it would have been easy for Robbins to make a standard anti-death penalty issue movie, presenting Poncelet as the victim of a miscarriage of justice or at least as someone who obviously deserves mercy because of strong mitigating factors in his case. He does not, however, try to make any excuses of this sort. At first Poncelet does indeed affirm his innocence, insisting that it was his accomplice who killed the two young people, and the rather naïve Sister Helen is manipulated into supporting his spurious grounds of appeal. Only shortly before his execution does he admit his responsibility. There are, moreover, no circumstances which might mitigate his guilt. The killings were brutal and merciless, and Poncelet comes across as a vicious individual, arrogant, callous and quite openly racist, who at first shows no remorse for his crimes. It is hardly surprising that the families of his victims' regard him as a monster, less than human and less even than an animal. The film is not, however, a standard propaganda movie. It is perhaps unusual in that it approaches its subject matter less from a secular political standpoint than from a religious one. Sister Helen's Catholic faith is a vital part of this story. After Poncelet's application for a pardon is declined the film ceases to be the story of the battle to save his life and becomes the story of the battle to save- quite literally- his soul. Redemption, for a Christian, is a supreme theological reality; it is not simply shorthand for turning over a new leaf or making up for past mistakes. The message of this film is the same as that of Birdman of Alcatraz; no person, however wicked, is beyond hope of redemption. The difference is that Dead Man Walking interprets this idea in a literal Christian sense whereas John Frankenheimer's film interpreted it in a secular one. Sean Penn gives a very convincing performance as a man who seemingly delights in his reputation but whose diabolical persona is really a mask put on to avoid having to confront the awful reality of what he has done. Penn often makes a good villain, as in Casualties of War, but his role as Poncelet is something more complex than just a straightforward bad guy. Susan Sarandon (a former girlfriend of Penn) received the Best Actress Oscar for her role as Sister Helen, although I thought that she was lucky to win ahead of Meryl Streep (The Bridges of Madison County) and Emma Thompson (Sense and Sensibility). The reason may have lain in the Academy's tendency to spread its awards as widely as possible; Streep already had two Oscars under her belt in 1995, whereas Sarandon had previously been nominated three times without success. It is often difficult to portray saintly characters without making them seem insipid, and I do not think that Sarandon entirely succeeds here; Sister Helen occasionally comes across as too much of a wide-eyed innocent. My main criticism of Dead Man Walking would be that it is too slow moving and too dominated by talk.

The one exception is perhaps Just Cause (also from 1995), which starts off as a standard liberal anti-capital punishment drama and then appears to reverse its stance, probably because the plot hangs on a silly-clever twist which the scriptwriter threw in without caring that it negated the ideological stance he had taken at the beginning of the film. How one reacts to films of this nature probably depends to some extent on one's own attitude to the death penalty, yet although I am personally (for various reasons) opposed to capital punishment I frequently find them unsatisfactory or unconvincing. Probably the best is The Birdman of Alcatraz, which approaches the question from an oblique angle by showing that even the most hardened murderer is capable of reform, followed by a few reconstructions of real-life miscarriages of justice, notably Ten Rillington Place which told the story of Timothy Evans and John Christie. Many of the others, however, simply proceed from the assumption that capital punishment is barbaric. This has never struck me as a valid argument, merely an arrogant assumption of moral superiority over one's opponents in the debate and a claim that because of their supposed moral inferiority their arguments are not worthy of serious consideration. Nobody has ever been converted from one viewpoint to another simply by calling them a barbarian. Given that Dead Man Walking was directed by Tim Robbins, one of Hollywood's most prominent liberals, and starred his equally liberal long-term partner Susan Sarandon, I was expecting it to be another piece of moral grandstanding. Instead it takes a rather more subtle look at the moral issues involved. It is based upon the writings of Sister Helen Prejean, a Roman Catholic nun and anti-death penalty activist who appears as one of the two main characters. The other is Matthew Poncelet, a Louisiana death row prisoner who has been sentenced to death for the murder of a teenage couple and who asks Sister Helen to help him with his final appeal. When this is turned down, he asks her to be his spiritual adviser in the days leading up to his execution. Given his own political convictions, it would have been easy for Robbins to make a standard anti-death penalty issue movie, presenting Poncelet as the victim of a miscarriage of justice or at least as someone who obviously deserves mercy because of strong mitigating factors in his case. He does not, however, try to make any excuses of this sort. At first Poncelet does indeed affirm his innocence, insisting that it was his accomplice who killed the two young people, and the rather naïve Sister Helen is manipulated into supporting his spurious grounds of appeal. Only shortly before his execution does he admit his responsibility. There are, moreover, no circumstances which might mitigate his guilt. The killings were brutal and merciless, and Poncelet comes across as a vicious individual, arrogant, callous and quite openly racist, who at first shows no remorse for his crimes. It is hardly surprising that the families of his victims' regard him as a monster, less than human and less even than an animal. The film is not, however, a standard propaganda movie. It is perhaps unusual in that it approaches its subject matter less from a secular political standpoint than from a religious one. Sister Helen's Catholic faith is a vital part of this story. After Poncelet's application for a pardon is declined the film ceases to be the story of the battle to save his life and becomes the story of the battle to save- quite literally- his soul. Redemption, for a Christian, is a supreme theological reality; it is not simply shorthand for turning over a new leaf or making up for past mistakes. The message of this film is the same as that of Birdman of Alcatraz; no person, however wicked, is beyond hope of redemption. The difference is that Dead Man Walking interprets this idea in a literal Christian sense whereas John Frankenheimer's film interpreted it in a secular one. Sean Penn gives a very convincing performance as a man who seemingly delights in his reputation but whose diabolical persona is really a mask put on to avoid having to confront the awful reality of what he has done. Penn often makes a good villain, as in Casualties of War, but his role as Poncelet is something more complex than just a straightforward bad guy. Susan Sarandon (a former girlfriend of Penn) received the Best Actress Oscar for her role as Sister Helen, although I thought that she was lucky to win ahead of Meryl Streep (The Bridges of Madison County) and Emma Thompson (Sense and Sensibility). The reason may have lain in the Academy's tendency to spread its awards as widely as possible; Streep already had two Oscars under her belt in 1995, whereas Sarandon had previously been nominated three times without success. It is often difficult to portray saintly characters without making them seem insipid, and I do not think that Sarandon entirely succeeds here; Sister Helen occasionally comes across as too much of a wide-eyed innocent. My main criticism of Dead Man Walking would be that it is too slow moving and too dominated by talk.

Scene after scene unfolds at such a patient rhythm, with such forecast and subtlety, that ultimately we appear to be experiencing a moving slideshow of the Depression. The film has a serious nobility and formality, which is fine---I found it fascinating that Woody Guthrie seems to take a backseat through his own biopic and that it is less about him and more about the time in which he lived---however it doesn't tend to have much life, which would be enthralling.The film maintains thorough fidelity to that adventure. Another element I admire greatly is that there's not an ingenuous frame in it, not a moment when we sense the significance of Guthrie's life has been arbitrated in favor of Hollywood license-taking. David Carradine's performance as Guthrie finds just the correct pitch between his dignity and inborn candor. There can hardly have been a period film before it with such affectionate heed to every historical detail, to the ways cars and dresses and living rooms and roadside diners looked during the Depression. We learn so much unconsciously through the mise-en-scene. All of these attributes have been treated cautiously, and with reverence. And ironically, as much as those elements are top-heavy compared to the drama itself, they are all done with the same deliberate subtlety with which Ashby lenses his other films. The imagery never points to itself; it's just there for us to subliminally take in.Nevertheless Bound For Glory is altogether a very sluggish experience. Each scene is organized so deliberately, is framed by immortal cinematographer Haskell Wexler with such virtuosity, is played with such gravity, that ultimately the movie feels too uniform. We want more drollery, more cheek, more of an clue that Guthrie had vinegar infused with his altruism. Anyone who loves movies or is intrigued by Guthrie should see Bound For Glory, though it'll be a rewarding affair that's very languid.There are two shots that are especially unforgettable One is an incredible image showcasing a dust storm nearing Woody's little home town, and another is a shot on top of a freight train, held for minutes without a cut, while Woody and an accompanying vagabond share worldviews while the train carries them past the infinite fields, into the pitch black of a tunnel, reappears, feels about to run forever. However, the movie's political text, the doggedness of Woody and a musician friend to unionize the migrant workers, is calculable and repetitious.

It may also largely account for the arresting fascination of the viewer with the Great Depression than the subject of the Great Depression does.

That question can be summarized as What is the proper Balance between Freedom and Order? Randall P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) is the central protagonist of this film. At the beginning of the film, he is being transferred from the state prison where he is incarcerated for Statutory Rape, to a mental facility for evaluation, following complaints of belligerency and violence. From the time he arrives at the facility he seems to enjoy disturbing the status-quo, upsetting certain individuals (Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) in particular) and inciting rebellion amongst the other patients against the authority of the nursing staff. Though this rebellion is often times uplifting, and seemingly good for the other patients' well being, at other times it is destructive and harmful especially during the ending of the film.Nurse Ratched, while often portrayed as an unflinching power hungry authoritarian figure, does legitimately seem concerned for the well being of her patients. Like McMurphy, the outcome of her stance, seems to bring both good and ill for the patient's fragile mental states. She is the main antagonist to McMurphy, and the two often square off, almost using the other patients as pawns in a power struggle.The film ends, after several confrontations (each escalating in intensity) with the aftermath of a disruptive and forbidden party involving alcohol and sex held in the ward after hours. One of the more emotionally disturbed patients (and new friend of McMurphy) commits suicide after facing the social consequences of an illicit sexual encounter McMurphy pressured him into during the party. After this suicide, a visibly shaken Nurse Ratched, attempts to maintain order encouraging the group to return to the daily routine. McMurphy is upset by her insistence on maintaining routine after the death of his friend, and thus attempts to strangle her to death. After this confrontation, he is lobotomized as he has become dangerous to others as indicated by his violent outburst. Once Chief (a close friend of McMurphy portrayed by Will Sampson) notices his condition, he suffocates him (out of seeming compassion) and escapes in a dramatic manner, in homage to McMurphy's earlier attempt.Both sides of the quandary of freedom and order win and lose in the ending of the film. Nurse Ratched protects the group by putting down (via the lobotomy) the dangerous element of McMurphy, yet, McMurphy inspired the freedom of Chief. It seems to me that the film wants us to ask how much individual freedom is necessary, and how much social control is necessary, yet answers neither for us. The film is different than say George Orwell's 1984 in that it raises the issue without preaching a message, letting us decide for ourselves. It also differs from 1984 by its modern day realistic setting, as opposed to the fantastic future of 1984, making the question more timely, as opposed to the more speculative and\/ or allegorical nature of Orwell's work.The editing of the film was utilitarian, but that is not necessarily an insult. The film introduces us to the characters and situation at hand, without getting in our way with distracting artistic shots or melodramatic scenes (not that those are necessarily bad in the right context). There are a few places where the direction and editing do differ from the rest of the film, but these scenes are well done, and do not effect the feel of the film negatively.The first is the opening, where the daily routine as structured by Ratched is enacted as the nursing and security staff ready the ward for the day. The almost robotic readying of the pills, waking of the patients and starting of the records is almost entirely dialogue free, allowing us to see the precision of the status-quo before the arrival of McMurphy.The second is the climax of the film. The shots become longer, and the scenes slower paced, so that we can feel the weight of the various actions both past and present. As the consequences of both Ratched and McMurphy's actions come to light, the film forces us to focus on the human cost of the fight.One Motif Present throughout the film is the use of the Nudy Deck. Several times throughout the film, McMurphy pulls out a deck of pornographically themed playing cards, which he seems to play with during important scenes. To me the deck seems to reference his irreverence toward authority and the concerns of others. He also uses the deck to toy with the mind of one of the more simple minded patients. He seems to escape into them, when he does not want to bother with the world around him.Another Motif is the Mountain. In the opening shot, we see a mountain range in the distance. Later in the film Chief tells McMurphy he is strong as a mountain. Later when Chief escapes, the music that played during the mountain range shot returns, bringing us back to the image of the mountain. The mountain is strength of will. The theme of this film is classic. The question of how much power a person should have, as compared to that of authority figures, is one that has been debated for centuries. I like that this film points out the argument, without attempting to give us an answer. It expects us to bring our own assumptions, feelings and thoughts to the film, so that we may interpret it according to our values, and not those of anyone else.

As the consequences of both Ratched and McMurphy's actions come to light, the film forces us to focus on the human cost of the fight.One Motif Present throughout the film is the use of the Nudy Deck. Several times throughout the film, McMurphy pulls out a deck of pornographically themed playing cards, which he seems to play with during important scenes. To me the deck seems to reference his irreverence toward authority and the concerns of others. He also uses the deck to toy with the mind of one of the more simple minded patients. He seems to escape into them, when he does not want to bother with the world around him.Another Motif is the Mountain. In the opening shot, we see a mountain range in the distance. Later in the film Chief tells McMurphy he is strong as a mountain. Later when Chief escapes, the music that played during the mountain range shot returns, bringing us back to the image of the mountain. The mountain is strength of will. The theme of this film is classic. The question of how much power a person should have, as compared to that of authority figures, is one that has been debated for centuries. I like that this film points out the argument, without attempting to give us an answer. It expects us to bring our own assumptions, feelings and thoughts to the film, so that we may interpret it according to our values, and not those of anyone else.

And then we leave Jesus behind as we spend three and a half hours following the story of Judah Ben-Hur. Subtitle notwithstanding this is not A Tale of the Christ. Oh Jesus pops up now and again for a few brief moments. But this is a tale of Ben-Hur. So who is this Ben-Hur fellow? Well he's a man whose life's journey goes something along the lines of wealthy Jew in Jerusalem turned galley slave turned adopted son of Roman nobleman turned champion chariot racer. Well that certainly sounds like an exciting life. But the way the story is presented doesn't make for a particularly exciting movie. This movie is quite a slog. 212 long, long, long minutes. And the sad reality is it didn't have to be this way. The movie could have so easily been streamlined to great effect. So many scenes that go on so much longer than they have to. So much time utterly wasted. This movie could have clocked in at two and a half hours without losing anything important. Instead what we get is a potentially fascinating story which, in the way it is told, ends up being somewhat monotonous. There are good reasons nobody makes three-plus hour biblical epics anymore.This is a movie which has its moments but there is a lot of tedium along the way. The most famous sequence is of course the undeniably exciting chariot race. But even that scene serves as an example of the ways in which the movie goes wrong. The race itself is a little long but we can forgive that as by this point in the story we're looking for all the excitement we can get. But the wait for the race to actually start is interminable. The buildup as we wait for the chariots to get to the starting line goes on forever and a day. Just the most obvious example of a sequence which serves no purpose other than to bring the film's momentum to an abrupt halt. Honestly, was director William Wyler being paid by the minute? This movie screams out for an editor with the freedom to slice and dice this thing down to size. But alas that was not to be.I suppose one has to make allowances for the time in which a movie is made. Ben-Hur clearly is a film with a style which plays much better in 1959 than it does today. It's big and grand and epic. But in so many ways too big and grand and epic for its own good. It certainly looks spectacular, making it easy to see how awards for cinematography, costume design and set decoration were among the slew of Oscars which came this film's way. It's understandable that Charlton Heston would get an Oscar for his challenging task of carrying the film over it's endless running time. I'm still trying to figure out what Hugh Griffith did to get a supporting actor Oscar though. You can see how the pieces were there to make a potentially great film. And you can see why upon its initial release it was in fact lauded as a great film. But it's not 1959 anymore. Time has been less kind to this great film than others of its period. In the end the movie suffers because it refuses to end. On and on and on it goes. Brief moments of excitement, long stretches of boredom. Even after the great climax of the chariot race the movie just won't stop. We get a good old-fashioned leprosy storyline which is about as appealing and entertaining as you would imagine it to be. And finally, and I do mean finally, Jesus shows up again to bookend the proceedings. No prizes for guessing how the Jesus story turns out. As for the Ben-Hur story it's one which had the potential to entertain and inspire. But the story's impact is dulled by the way in which it was told. It's a self-important epic which is too darned epic.

All he really wants to do is find his own place in the world. Dr. Larch owns the orphanage and he also does illegal abortions on the side. Candy comes into the picture when she comes to get an abortion. Homer is the doctors help in the clinic, but he refuses to do abortions. The doctor believes he is helping the women and the children so that the children do not have to grow up without a home. Homer refuses to believe growing up where he did is worse than never experiencing life. Ironically, abortion is what brought Homer and Candy together. The film brought in several different emotions and was very powerful. The costumes and even the props down to pictures on the walls were believably from the 40's time period. Everything down to the lighting was perfect to portray this period and draw you in. By using a soft colored tone throughout the movie, we were better able to emotionally connect. The lighting was perfect scene by scene. The orphanage is made to look a little darker and more sad. Especially in the scenes where they film the orphans talking at night. The lighting on the beach was bright and made us excited when Homer saw the beach for the first time. They used the right amount of light to portray sadness as they did to portray happiness. The settings always allowed us to relate to the emotions of the movie. I think the settings and lighting went hand in hand in allowing us to feel what they were feeling. The beautiful beach and how it was lighted up so bright and the orphanage and how it was far away and dark and dim are examples of this. The director uses the camera angle nicely and the zoom feature a lot to draw attention to the important parts of scenes. When Homer is the bedroom with Candy everything around him is dark and you can only focus on him while the camera slowly zooms in. The director catches the emotions of the actors with close ups also.

The (then) two-hour German expressionist science fiction masterpiece carried an immediate appeal for me I know not many will share. Nevertheless, I was excited at the prospect of seeing the film again, and on the big screen this summer, now 'complete' with 25 minutes of newly integrated footage uncovered in Buenos Aires in 2008.Other than that the experience was marred by a crummy digital projection, the new cut of the film is nothing short of revelatory for fans and cinephiles. The restored scenes, which were cut in 1927 following early criticism, expand the scope and breadth of the narrative, rounding out a much more human film.It's a shame so little could be done to spruce up the supplemental material. I was initially put off by just how starkly it contrasted with the clean, relatively well-preserved 35mm whole; the 16mm additions are matted along the top and left of the frame, and are so scratched that the scenes appear to exist amidst an omnipresent rainstorm. But bad as they look, their benefit to the film is undeniable. My only real objection to their inclusion is in two to three second insert or reaction shots, where splicing in the new content seems more distracting than it is productive. Largely, however, the aesthetic unpleasantries are worth the emotional payoff of a more satisfying story.The other issue is that Metropolis was already a long film, and one that isn't always easy to appreciate in a modern context. Fortunately, its narrative backbone is a simple but timeless 'workers vs. social elite' fable, and the sincere, if unchallenging, plot makes plenty of room for contemplation. It's easy to just slip into Lang's world, and though the pacing and running-time hardly render it accessible, what's really incredible about the film is how well its visuals still hold up.The towering, angular cityscapes, oppressive walls of machinery, and the now iconic machine man are stylistic triumphs that look great today and have had obvious influence on more recent science fiction\/fantasy classics, from the dark metropolis of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner to character design for Star Wars. The fact that it was even possible in 1927 is as incredible as Kubrick's half-centennial Space Odyssey was for 1968. Maybe more so.It's rare and awesome that a piece of art is as ahead of its time as 2001 or Metropolis were. Fritz Lang's film may not be a 2010 audience-pleaser, but in its flawless realization of its world, it's every bit on par with something like Inception. Lang's vision of the future is in many ways still our own, which helps account for its long shelf life. The forward-thinking design and fantastic visuals make it easy to forget that it saw release twenty years before Isaac Asimov published his compilation, I, Robot.The Complete Metropolis, though not completely complete, is absolutely the best way to see the film.

Those with a vested interest in the history of film, particularly science-fiction film, absolutely need to seek it out if they haven't already &#x97;The new cut is even worth reanalysis for those underwhelmed by the previously available version. It's a real treasure, however, for longtime fans, who'll be glad to hear the 25 extra minutes, while not pretty, substantially benefit the story.

That way the movie would had been better to watch and possibly also more fun. Now instead the movie starts giving you an headache with all of its characters and its long dialog. In the end you also just really don't know who is fighting who anymore and why. I can really see and appreciate what director Christopher McQuarrie was trying to do with this movie but I think he should just stick to his writing career. He can write great and also complicated stories, he just can't tell them very well, as this movie proofs.For this movie he still got a whole bunch of well known names to appear in his movie. Besides Ryan Phillippe and Benicio Del Toro, also Juliette Lewis, Taye Diggs and James Caan make their appearances. In a way it's also really an actors movie, since it's often filed with some long dialog. Nevertheless there also is plenty or room for some action, which still helps to spice things up a little for the movie. The action is simply great for most part.The movie never really gets horrible to watch but it also never really becomes an intriguing or entertaining one.

That way the movie would had been better to watch and possibly also more fun. Now instead the movie starts giving you an headache with all of its characters and its long dialog. In the end you also just really don't know who is fighting who anymore and why. I can really see and appreciate what director Christopher McQuarrie was trying to do with this movie but I think he should just stick to his writing career. He can write great and also complicated stories, he just can't tell them very well, as this movie proofs.For this movie he still got a whole bunch of well known names to appear in his movie. Besides Ryan Phillippe and Benicio Del Toro, also Juliette Lewis, Taye Diggs and James Caan make their appearances. In a way it's also really an actors movie, since it's often filed with some long dialog.

It tries to be just like them but it perhaps tries a bit too hard. It tries to combine basically every element that makes these type of old fashioned crime movies so great. It's just too much and it doesn't make the movie a very consistent one either. It therefore all also doesn't work out too original, which makes this movie feel a pretty redundant and pointless one, that you can easily do without.No, it by no means is an horrible movie but it's also not one I'm eager on ever seeing again.

It had excellent animation, great voice actors, songs were amazing, and really good characters. I loved every moment of watching it The animation is excellent. When Aladdin came out, they thought it was going to be a huge flop because of the success of beauty and the beast earlier that year. Well it did very well even the animation was great. who ever thought Disney could create excellent scenery for a sandy dessert, a tiger talking cave, a market place, and a flying carpet? Great voice actors all i can say. This proves that Disney doesn't need a list celeberties to play their characters. Yes Aladdin had Robin Wiliams and Scott weigner (steve from FullHouse) and most people probably knew the voice of Iago (forget how to spell his name)and the rest weren't very well known however you don't need well known voice actors to create great characters.Aladdin has great songs to. Though in my opinion not as great as the lion king songs( because i like Elton's music) it still had great songs. It was also Howard Ashman last music he worked on (though he only did 3) which makes it much more memorable. My favorite songs from Aladdin are A whole new world, One jump ahead, and Friend like me.I love the characters in Aladdin. They had a handsome lead(Aladdin), a well developed sidekick (Genie), a spunky princess (Jasmine), and a very good villain (Jafar) as well as a great supporting characters.

This isn't just something to make it a title that is easily recognizable or to know what country it's from. It's about an American state of being, what it is to be a gigolo who likes swanky suits and fast cars and, well, the women he gets what he has to work for. But what happens when this man's reputation is called into question, or what kind of reputation a gigolo has? Politics also comes into it, not too oddly enough, as Julian (Richard Gere) catches the eye of a woman who is married to a Senator. That the movie is technically a murder mystery, sort of, as Julian is accused of killing a woman who he had seen previously as a 'fetish' customer, is almost besides the point. It is good for the plot, but what Julian has to focus on, the big question for him, is what is he doing with himself? How do other people look at him? He makes himself a sex symbol, of sorts, as he works out religiously and always gets the best clothes (like a peacock perhaps). Schrader puts a lot of focus on the relationship Julian has with Michelle, who genuinely cares about him and is probably the only person he knows who is straight with him (certainly not the pimp played by Bill Duke, or his mentor who has her own gaggle of men and women to 'send out'). Of course sexuality plays into it, but I liked the fact that Schrader didn't focus squarely on it. He's interested in some of the mechanics of it (there's a scene where Julian\/Michele do it, but it's shot much in the way of Godard's A Married Woman, lots of single shots of body parts, some flesh, but selective eroticism), and then, mostly, the consequences.But, again, the look of the film should be an indicator. This is Los Angeles of 1979\/1980, but it portends the future decade not just in the city but in the kind of middle-upper (or just upper) class lifestyle of expensive restaurants, good drinks, good clothes, and sometimes good women (or just lonely older women). Schrader even has a way of looking ahead to the future with Giorgio Moroder's score, which takes Blondie's Call Me and turns it into a synth score full of dread and mystery and drama. On top of how the look, its stylish exteriors and careful lighting (the Bruckheimer look before Tony Scott took it over with smoke machines), and the depth of the script, Gere is also fantastic here. He was on a roll right after Days of Heaven, and here he lights up the screen with charisma, pathos, intensity, and a sense of where to take the scenes where they need to be.He, much like the environment around him, makes up what is the backdrop for a tale of morality in high society, hypocrisy where it may lay in the highs and lows, and what it means to fall in love. The only part it doesn't fully work is as a full-fledged thriller (again, the murder-mystery element is the weakest link), but everything else sparks the screen with interest and excitement.

The film illustrates the importance of working as a team to beat impossible circumstances. Sean Astin plays the main character Mikey, who is first to discover an old treasure map in family home's attic. His brother Brand is played by a young, Josh Brolin. These two play opposites character wise. Brand is more athletic and strong while Mikey is smaller and has an external weakness of asthma. However it is Mikey that is the one who guides the group of misfits through an underground, booby trap adventure and discover the treasure. The brother's family home is about to be foreclosed on unless their parents can come up with the money.Other stars of the film include Goonies Kerri Green, who plays Andy, a cheerleader and love interest to Brolin's character, Kerri Green, who plays Stef, Corey Feldman as Mouth, Jeff Cohen as Chunk, and Ke-Huy Quan as Data. The group is constantly on the run from the Fratelli crime family, who in the opening scenes helps one of their counterparts escape jail. Anne Ramsey plays Mama Fratelli, who discovers what the goony group is up to and prompts her sons Jake and Francis, who are played by Robert Davi and Joe Pantoliano, respectively, to chase after them. There is one more son, Sloth, played by John Matoszak, who is deformed and has a growling Frankenstein-like dialog. Sloth is left behind along with a captured Chunk who soon becomes friends over the love for food and they join forces to go save the goonies from the Fratellis who are on their trail. Each goony character played an important role in helping the group advance further in discovering the treasure. Those that stood out were Mikey (Astin) who is the encourager that will not give up in helping his family and will not allow the group to give up either, Data (Quan), is equipped with special gadgets that help the goonies get through the trail to the treasure and Mouth (Feldman), is able to interpret the map which is in Spanish and helps to give the film a funnier edge with his smart antics. The character Sloth (Matoszak) ends up becoming an honorary goony for his attempts to rescue them from his family. The Goonies was an earlier kiddy version of the Disney film, National Treasure (2004), which stars Nicholas Cage as a treasure hunter who is looking for mysterious and unbeknown artifacts. Unlike The Goonies his adventures are around the entire country not just below one Oceanside suburb. Perhaps both films draw from the film, Indiana Jones (1981-1989, 2008), which stars Harrison Ford as a part time college professor and part time adventurous historian, who travels the globe to rescue artifacts from the wrong hands and put them in a museum. All these films focus on defeating the odds and a hero shining through at the end. However, I believe Goonies was the first to focus on a group of children on this type of quest. The film uses techniques in camera angles and lighting to give a more realistic feel to the viewer. There are points were you actually forget the adventure is really only taking place underneath a town. Throughout most of the film, low key lighting is used to draw the audience into the setting of the dark cave the group is in. It gives an eerie feeling while at the same time allowing for the element of surprise of what may be up next. It was also very natural like you are right there with the characters, especially when they use candles and flashlights as the main light source. A diagonal camera angle was used in some scenes to present an approaching feel. Especially when the group was traveling into the unknown as one. The characters are in a grouping of shortest to tallest from front to back to give this angle an even greater effect. These techniques were needed to bring the audience into the actions on the screen and engage their interest further.All the elements tie in to make this film enjoyable to watch and be a part of. Each character was able to hold your interest with their unique talent and ways. Each scene of their adventure will allow you to seem as if you are part of the effort to find the treasure. This film gives great significance to the word teamwork and will encourage those biggest to smallest to stop at nothing to make a dream reality.

","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family"},{"date":"29 July 2010","score":"","review":" The Goonies is about a group of young adults that guide themselves into an adventure on the quest to find a legendary lost treasure. The film illustrates the importance of working as a team to beat impossible circumstances. Sean Astin plays the main character Mikey, who is first to discover an old treasure map in family home's attic. His brother Brand is played by a young, Josh Brolin. These two play opposites character wise. Brand is more athletic and strong while Mikey is smaller and has an external weakness of asthma. However it is Mikey that is the one who guides the group of misfits through an underground, booby trap adventure and discover the treasure. The brother's family home is about to be foreclosed on unless their parents can come up with the money.Other stars of the film include Goonies Kerri Green, who plays Andy, a cheerleader and love interest to Brolin's character, Kerri Green, who plays Stef, Corey Feldman as Mouth, Jeff Cohen as Chunk, and Ke-Huy Quan as Data. The group is constantly on the run from the Fratelli crime family, who in the opening scenes helps one of their counterparts escape jail. Anne Ramsey plays Mama Fratelli, who discovers what the goony group is up to and prompts her sons Jake and Francis, who are played by Robert Davi and Joe Pantoliano, respectively, to chase after them. There is one more son, Sloth, played by John Matoszak, who is deformed and has a growling Frankenstein-like dialog. Sloth is left behind along with a captured Chunk who soon becomes friends over the love for food and they join forces to go save the goonies from the Fratellis who are on their trail. Each goony character played an important role in helping the group advance further in discovering the treasure. Those that stood out were Mikey (Astin) who is the encourager that will not give up in helping his family and will not allow the group to give up either, Data (Quan), is equipped with special gadgets that help the goonies get through the trail to the treasure and Mouth (Feldman), is able to interpret the map which is in Spanish and helps to give the film a funnier edge with his smart antics. The character Sloth (Matoszak) ends up becoming an honorary goony for his attempts to rescue them from his family. The Goonies was an earlier kiddy version of the Disney film, National Treasure (2004), which stars Nicholas Cage as a treasure hunter who is looking for mysterious and unbeknown artifacts. Unlike The Goonies his adventures are around the entire country not just below one Oceanside suburb. Perhaps both films draw from the film, Indiana Jones (1981-1989, 2008), which stars Harrison Ford as a part time college professor and part time adventurous historian, who travels the globe to rescue artifacts from the wrong hands and put them in a museum. All these films focus on defeating the odds and a hero shining through at the end. However, I believe Goonies was the first to focus on a group of children on this type of quest. The film uses techniques in camera angles and lighting to give a more realistic feel to the viewer. There are points were you actually forget the adventure is really only taking place underneath a town. Throughout most of the film, low key lighting is used to draw the audience into the setting of the dark cave the group is in. It gives an eerie feeling while at the same time allowing for the element of surprise of what may be up next. It was also very natural like you are right there with the characters, especially when they use candles and flashlights as the main light source.

We have words like  Orwellian  that have come in to everyday modern usage . Indeed there's at least two television shows BIG BROTHER and ROOM 101 who take their concepts from 1984 . It seems logical that if someone was going to make a film adaptation of the novel then 1984 would be the perfect year to release it . Unfortunately Michael Radford's interpretation of Orwell is an irritating clash between the good and the bad Radford's visuals are superb and the tone sets the dark , gloomy , downbeat feel of the novel perfectly . Orwell used Stalin's Soviet Union for much of the novel's inspiration as well as 1940s Britain . The film's set design is drab and retro and full of urban decay and squalor that Ingsoc has brought to Airstrip One , you can almost smell the rats and rubble and exploding rocket bombs . All this is helped in no small part by Roger Deakins bleak cinematography . Radford also makes good use of the newscreens giving war reports on the crusade against Eurasia . Even the much criticised soundtrack by the Eurythmics seem perfectly suited to the film . John Hurt seems born to play the role of Winston Smith the middle aged hero of the novel . Unfortunately Hurt isn't given enough material to make the role as memorable as the one played by Peter Cushing in the 1954 BBC version because Radford the screenwriter is no Nigel Kneale . The problem with the film is the storytelling Many people would consider the novel unfilmable . Nigel Kneale managed to carry it off 30 years earlier but Kneale was something of a genius where scriptwriting was concerned . Radford isn't . From the opening scene we see Winston , Julia and O'Brien at the public hate meeting . However both Julie and O'Brien are then quickly forgotten until much later in the film . The screenplay really does meander greatly at some points giving us flashbacks to Winston visiting a prostitute and Winston as a child . What's to do with the plot ? Nothing absolutely nothing but seem to be included for some reason known only to he editor . Likewise Winston proclaims to Julia that he loves corruption and wants the whole world to be corrupt . What's his motivation for this ? he's done nothing on screen that suggests he believes this . Perhaps the editor has taken out an important scene whilst keeping meaningless ones ? Strangely for a film containing so much full frontal nudity it seems strange that the classic line  You're only a rebel from the waist down  is missing Certainly the scenes in Room 101 could have done with a bit of trimming . Unfortunately those of us who saw the 1954 BBC version will be disappointed by it . The scene with Andre Morrell as O Brien giving a soliloquy on the aims and method of the party is a piece of unforgettable television . There's nothing really wrong with Richard Burton in the same role as such but probably needed a proper introductory scene in order to make the character work properly . If you've no knowledge of the novel you might have a problem knowing who his character is supposed to be In short this is a slightly disappointing film version of a legendary novel written by one of the 20th Century's most important figures . Certainly it can't be faulted by the visual look which is highly impressive but unless you've read the book you'll probably be confused and bored long before the final scene . Despite the very low production values I was utterly transfixed by Rudolph Cartier\/ Nigel Kneale's BBC version which sadly wasn't the case here ","genre":null},{"date":"29 July 2010","score":"16 out of 22 people found the following review useful","review":" George Orwell's 1984 is one of the most celebrated novels of the 20th Century .

Basically in Manhattan, New York, lives forty-two year old TV show writer Isaac Davis (BAFTA nominated Allen) who divorced his wife Jill (BAFTA nominated Meryl Streep) who is now a lesbian and writing a book about their relationship. Isaac is unhappy with his job and quits it so that he can concentrate on writing a book, and he spends most of his time dating seventeen year old high school student Tracy (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Mariel Hemingway). One day he meets Mary Wilke (Annie Hall's BAFTA nominated Diane Keaton), the mistress of his best friend Yale (Michael Murphy), married to Emily (Anne Byrne Hoffman), Isaac is developing a crush on her. He does not love Tracy like she loves him, and he ends it with her to start an affair with Mary after Yale splits with her. But Yale then splits with his wife and returns to Mary, Isaac is not happy and goes to have his say about the situation, but it doesn't work out to his advantage. Towards the end he thinks to himself about the beautiful face of Tracy, so he goes to find her before she leaves for England, and when he says his feelings, she wishes he could have done it before, he just gives her a slight smile when she leaves. Also starring Karen Ludwig as Connie, Michael O'Donoghue as Dennis, Karen Allen as Television Actor #2 and Wallace Shawn as Jeremiah. Filmed in black and white, it is a really interesting, more linear approach to a romantic comedy, and Allen still brings the same neurotic, paranoid and over thinking nature as Annie Hall. I don't understand why he wouldn't like this film, it is one of his finest works, not just because of the scripting and story, but is also celebrates the sights of Allen's beloved New York.
