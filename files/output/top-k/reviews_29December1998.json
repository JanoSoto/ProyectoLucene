Others in the last year or so have included Starship Troopers and Godzilla, neither of which seemed to set very high standards for themselves.  This is the first one I've seen of these films that seemed to actually be going for something that might be remembered, instead of just a monster\/alien film that people would see just to hold them over until May.  Now, writer Kevin Williamson (Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer) is fast becoming a current favorite of mine as far as movies targeted towards people such as myself (teenage, suspense fan.)  He recognizes the things that would make the type of film he's doing a bad one, then finds ways around all of them.  In The Faculty a small band of teenagers begin to suspect something I'm sure many people (myself included) have during high school the teachers are alien beings.  It sounds sort of lame when the plot is actually put into words, but the film manages to avoid that feeling for the most part.  It includes brief references to many science fiction stories, such as The Puppet Masters and Independence Day.  This is a technique, also used in Scream of getting around the possibility of some people accusing it of not being original.  In addition to making it different enough to be considered original enough by some people, the similarities to other stories are pointed out in the film so it doesn't seem to any people as if they are being deliberately hidden.  The film avoids the predictable idea of having the hero figure it all out before seeing enough to really suspect anything really out there.  You do, of course, see what's happening basically from the beginning of the events on Earth, so even if you haven't seen the promos, you still know basically what's going on.  If the film were done the way many lame alien films were, someone would see something strange for the first time, and immediately single out the idea of aliens as the only actual explanation, and be really surprised when nobody believed them.  Something like this happens, but it isn't really extreme and is not noticeable enough to detract from the story. The film also avoids the standard scene where the first one to know what happens tells someone else, and based on just that, they BELIEVE him. Nobody in the film believes what's happening until they see it for themselves, and it takes really conclusive proof to convince them that this stuff is actually happening.  As has been the case with most sci-fi films about an infestation of some kind, the entire problem, it is discovered, can be solved with one single, though very difficult step.  This is the one thing about the film that I did not find very believable.  Not only would this be highly unlikely in real life, but this fact is not really discovered so much as it is just guessed by someone who believes it's true because it's always the case in science fiction books.  At the end, of course, it turns out to work, but I guess the alternative would be for the characters to try to kill everyone in the faculty, which would be impossible before it spreads further (although it might go over really well among the high school audience).  Oh well, this minor flaw doesn't make too much of a big deal overall in the movie.  It was definitely worth seeing, although I wonder if it will be remembered very much since it is in the shadow of the Star Wars prequels.  I hope it is remembered, because this film definitely has something to offer for anyone who would be interested enough to see it in the first place.  It even had some surprises that caught me off guard, and I am usually on the lookout for such surprises while watching a film like this one.  I was also pleased to see that they didn't do what so many people are doing nowadays, which is to tack on something at the end which made it clear that the doorway was open for a possible sequel.  This film being the first good science fiction film I've seen since Independence Day, (I liked Contact, but didn't think it was really GOOD) is a much welcomed change of pace, and I hope to see more films as carefully planned as this one, and no more of the quickly made, good-special-effects-and-that's-it films.

Comments have been made about the film that it has a simple story and that the movie has simple characters.  While all of these claims may have some validity, to say that the film has no depth is unfair.  When one studies how much thought really was put in Lucas' trilogy, they should be amazed. While the film borrows from mythology, Lucas has made sure that each film has a major twist from its ancestors.  In the first film for example, Luke goes to rescue a princess, but instead she is the one that ends up saving him. Not only does the story telling have a twist on classic mythology, it has an underlying theme and many sub-themes that no other movie can match. After studying the trilogy, redemption is the theme most often explored. Every major good character in the trilogy at one time falls and then redeems himself. The ultimate redemption being Darth Vader who will be the main character in the new trilogy being developed as I type. As for the characters being simple, this seems unfair.  They are archtypes.  Characters common throughout all cultures.  Also, all the major characters have motivation for their actions unlike most good guy\/bad guy movies.  The bad guys in the films are bad because of human flaws such as the struggle for power and greed.  They are not simple bad for bad's sake. Even the main villain of the trilogy becomes very human by the end of the trilogy when he redeems himself.  The film doesn't show the bad guys only as something to shoot at, but as human beings that have been lead astray.  The two trilogies are ultimately about how a human being can become a monster, and that a monster is still a human being in the end. The Star Wars trilogy has more depth than at first glance.

Because I think that this movie is the most psychologically disturbing and shocking movie I have ever seen in my life on this planet. I read the revues about the realism of the war scenes and thought what the hell it can't be any worse than Platoon or Full Metal Jacket, I'll give it a try... bad lapse of judgement.The movie is three hours long, and after maybe the first ten minutes I wanted to leave... but the thought was that sooner or later this assault on the senses must let-up... you wait and you wait and you wait, and it doesn't! The realism, the emotions, the atmosphere of war, are all there for the three full hours. Even in the quiet, I can't use the word peaceful, moments of the movie there are still the oppressive feelings of the expectation that this certainly can not last... and it doesn't. These moments are played to the best effects of the greatest suspense movies.My friend and I left the cinema after the final credits, we couldn't say anything....I don't know whether to think of Mr. Spielberg as the greatest movie maker on the face of this planet... or the most irresponsible manufacturer of shock horror movies ever... but this is really not the correct way to put it because, shocking it was without a shadow of a doubt, but, horror it most definitely was not... If you watched all of the news, or documentaries, that were ever made about the scenes and effects of war it would not be one percent of the preparation required to watch this movie.Anyone who sees this movie can not fail to be affected by it... consequently I tend to ere on the side of Mr Spielberg being a little irresponsible.

But I thought, between Dusk til Dawn & Desperado director Robert Rodriguez and Scream\/Dawson Creek writer Kevin Williamson, I could count on at least getting my 6 bucks worth.  I was wrong.  Everyone seems to be trying and the performances rank from acceptable to very good, but the material just isn't there.  Williamson has not written another Scream by any means.  I would be fine with that myself.  This movie felt rushed.  Despite its obvious flaws, it could have been so much better.  The entire first hour is almost pure set-up, and the pay off is terribly contrived and lame.  It almost felt like Williamson resents the audience of his films and this was some cruel joke on all of us.  And what of Robert Rodriguez?  His technical flair seems to have diminished.  Or perhaps the material was so lame, it gives him little to do.  I tend to want to believe the latter, because I expect much more from Rodriguez.  Perhaps its worse crime is the complete waste of acting talent.  We have some great actors from numerous generations represented.  Why waste Jon Stewart and Salma Hayek in such throw away rolls?  Robert Patrick repeats his T2 roll effectively and Bebe Neuwirth is pretty good when she gets a little screen time.  Piper Laurie I would have preferred to see in a sympathetic adult role instead of being reduced to roaming around the halls like a zombie.There are a few good points.  There are a few good jokes sprinkled through out, mostly provided by teens snorting some homemade crank-like powder and acting like morons.  The special effects are not painfully digital looking (most of the time).  And a few moments of suspense are to be found. Unfortunately it's just not worth other 90 minutes of complete and utter boredom.  If you must see this, wait til it goes to the bargain theater or video.

True, many of the points in the movie were valid, such as the need for doctors to relate to their patients as human beings first, and not as a disease.  However, the delivery of this message was heavy handed and overly done.  For example, did the movie really require Robin Williams' character to deliver a speech at the end of the movie summarizing the values portrayed vividly throughout the whole movie?  Hard to believe that any theatre audience would be so stupid as to not get the message.  In addition, the claim at the beginning that the movie was based on a true story was a transparent, cheap ploy to lend some credibility to a less than stellar story line.  The only thing that saved this movie from total disaster was Robin Williams' acting, which was, in a word, excellent. Mr. Williams' portrayal of a man seeking to become a doctor to serve humans and not just treating diseases seemed honest and appealing.

It's a well-done work of the young Sverak, but every time I read comments like wonderful, best movie or something like that, it makes me sick. You all the film fans from the USA, Australia and other non-european countries, just try to watch some of the Lubomir Lipsky comedies - now THAT is HUMOUR !

Barbra Streisand! More explicit the funny Barbra Streisand and the divine Barbra Streisand. Well, this miraculous metamorphosis is of course kind of disgusting and I wouldn't be the first person to argue that Barbra Streisand has a tendency to fancy herself pretty much (and I myself was already able to tell so from the unnecessarily long ending of The Prince of Tides - a very good movie). But as annoying as it may sometimes be, this is an extremely well-done and multi-faceted movie. Let me try to tell you, why I voted 7.It starts rather mediocre when Streisand and Jeff Bridges get to know each other, talk some silly stuff and behave like little children. From time to time it gives a number of very good lines to Lauren Bacall, who is perfect as Streisand's mother. By the time Streisand and Bridges get married you are tempted to say Yes, very nice, but it's crap actually, isn't it? But you won't think of saying that in the end.The movie is a romantic comedy - containing a couple of cliches, fine - but with a new, non-cliche structure. This is no kitsch, not at all, oh no! Instead, it's made up of very good lines and very truthful moments. These are connected in a way that makes our emotion rise but leaves us unable to tell which words, which gestures made it rise. How come? The romance doesn't develop in the way we would expect it and have seen it many times before, no, this romantic comedy goes the long way round First there is only a small deal of attraction, then there is previously unknown disillusionment - a black hole almost - and then love enters the stage. The final romantic scene fits into romantic comedy conventions, but it also fits into the picture and Streisand and Bridges deserve it. What a wonderful movie!Basically Barbra Streisand is a good actress, but she loves exaggerating. She is able to manage difficult scenes, but she tries to be funny where being funny can't work and sometimes she's just hopping through the scene like a twittering sparrow instead of performing the emotions required for that scene. And after her metamorphosis she's more interested in her make-up than in her character.Lauren Bacall plays a mean, self-addicted and vain old beast with a heart and a vulnerable soul. The scene where mother and daughter talk openly in the kitchen is wonderful. Even Pierce Brosnan is better than I would have expected.Finally, the movie shows us the great versatility of Jeff Bridges you've never seen him so very soft before (rude as he was in The Fabulous Baker Boys, cool in Nadine or smooth and evil in Jagged Edge). However, he is exaggerating, too which man can act this untruthful and affected?! In the scenes from Streisand's and his marriage his character is almost eerie - may this be good or bad for the movie...

There is no way, that The Thin Red Line is deeper and sharper than Saving Private Ryan, as many people expected. The film itself is very pretentious, wanting to be the Apocalypse Now of the 90's. Well, it is not. The movie is very over-produced, in terms of its extra-aesthetism, if it's possible to say so. I mean, parrots are beautiful birds, but do you really have to show close-ups of them four or five times? And shooting the sunlight, slowly coming through the trees is like reinventing a bicycle.In spite of the interesting characters and well-conducted narration, many of them, including the ones, played by famous actors are not developed enough for the audience to remember them. Pretty important characters, like Nick Nolte's and John Cusack's are lost in the 3rd hour. And if there was a nomination for the most senseless cameo ever - George Clooney could get one.In my opinion the film suffers from the poor editing. Watching the movie, I got an impression, that the production team was under the pressure to put the film in the regular movie-theater time frame (<= 3hours), so a lot of important things got lost. I would be really looking forward to the director's cut of The Thin Red Line. Otherwise, the film is simply weak.
