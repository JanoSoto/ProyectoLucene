It can easily be viewed as period piece, a character study, or a social commentary, among other things. Anyway you look at it, it proves to be an effective piece of film-making. A key to this success is the performance of Mark Wahlberg. Watching him make the transformation for clean-cut kid Eddie Adams to porn superstar Dirk Diggler is what keeps the audience invested in the story being told. In the first half of the film, when it's the most crucial, Wahlberg is able to maintain such innocence and charisma and yet seems instantly at home in the new decadent world his character finds himself in. These scenes work greatly to the film's advantage because they are played with such earnestness. Seeing Eddie Adams embark on his new career, we might as well be watching Peggy Sawyer (of 42nd Street) being told she's headed to Broadway. The whole thing just feels so unexpectedly clean, which in turn may be something of a setup for the much darker moments to come.Admittedly, the rise (in the late 70s) and fall (in the early 80s) of the pornography industry is an area of history we don't learn about in school. But it is a legitimate topic of interest, nonetheless. While it certainly contains humor and a plethora of colorful characters, Boogie Nights takes itself seriously. Aside from sex as a business, issues such as race relations, homophobia, and drug abuse, prove vital to the story it is telling. Another overriding theme of the film is the classic notion of fame as a double-edged sword. One heart wrenching plot line involves a porn actress, gently portrayed by the always wonderful Julianne Moore, who is engaged in a custody battle with her estranged husband over their children. The irony here is that throughout the film we have seen how naturally she mothers those around her, and yet she is ultimately deemed unfit to be a mother to her own children. I'm not saying that decision is wrong, but it isn't easy to watch as she's forced to accept it either. If in fact porn can ever be inspiring, it is something of an inspiration to see the concern the filmmakers within this film put upon themselves for producing a product they can be proud of. They strive to create movies their audiences will appreciate for reasons beyond the sex. We witness their creative process behind James Bond's porno counterpart, Brock Landers, from brainstorming through production. We see the adult industry's equivalent of the Academy Awards ceremony. It is only when we remind ourselves that these people are pornographers does any of this seem the least bit perverse. I strongly feel that this film is in no way trying to glamorize porn. (The ultimate fates of some of its characters are proof enough of that.) I do, however, feel that sometimes we are too quick to demonize based on preconceived notions. The characters we meet here are all consenting adults, engaged in a lucrative business. True, they are flirting with a myriad of dangers. But this film does them a great justice. It allows us to understand the psychology at work behind the choices they make. And it does us a justice too. It lets us choose whether or not we condemn them for it.

Its main virtues are a fine performance from Mel Gibson as Hamlet; a script that makes full use of the movie medium while giving Shakespeare sufficient scope to enrich and entertain us with his people and his words; two great performances from Alan Bates as Claudius and Paul Scofield as the Ghost; two good performances from Nathaniel Parker as Laertes and Glenn Close as Gertrude; and a fine music score from Ennio Morricone that anticipates and amplifies our emotions.First, my criticisms. In directing his actors, Franco Zefferelli makes two big mistakes, one interesting and one painful. The interesting mistake Ian Holm changes Polonius from a doddering old man to someone evil-minded and fully possessed of his wits. When this Polonius babbles about plays that are pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral he is being deliberately comic. One scene demonstrates the badness of this choice. We have no idea why this sharp-witted, not-very-old man is prating to the king and queen instead of coming to the point about Hamlet's madness. (Then again, Richard Briers gives us a smart Polonius in Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet, and there it worked.) The painful mistake Helena Bonham-Carter changes Ophelia from a meek victim to a strong-willed, independent-minded young woman. The director and actress probably thought they were being good little feminists, but the idea is psychologically and dramatically disastrous. Bonham-Carter's Ophelia could never go mad. And even if she could, her crass new self is no longer sharply contrasted with a meek former self. This Ophelia seems fully capable of being earthy and vulgar even before she loses her mind. This blunts the effect of the mad scenes which in themselves are beautifully presented and played.Now the praise. Gibson reads Shakespeare's words skillfully and is bettered in this regard only by Bates and Scofield; his readings convey the words' music and meaning at long last I understand the line, What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven. He also reveals one aspect of Hamlet that I see when I read the play. Hamlet is never more dangerous, or off-putting, than when he's clowning. The melancholy Hamlet attracts me and the joking Hamlet repels me. Gibson's Hamlet does the same.Shakespeare never suffers from the artful cutting and rearrangement of his text. This script is especially clever. Among many nice surprises was hearing Hamlet deliver his Get thee to a nunnery speech to Ophelia as they sit in the audience before the play. Even better are the dozens of little touches that only a movie can provide. I loved how the camera showed Hamlet and Polonius spy on scenes that in most productions take place out of their sights. But the script and direction are also a shade too restless. The camera shots and the scenery change rapidly as characters dart from one place to another. Once or twice the movie should have paused and let us luxuriate in the language. The perfect opportunity would have been the To be or not to be speech; but Gibson and Zefferelli make it a scene of high drama. I craved the usual Hamlet who stops and tells us what he thinks because he wants to overhear himself.The idea of Hamlet and Gertrude lusting for each other works surprisingly well. Most post-Freudian productions present this notion, but I don't think it's in the play. The interview in the bed chamber is Polonius' idea, not Hamlet's or Gertrude's. And even Hamlet's most piquant behavior, including his condemnation of his mother's sex life, is consistent with that of a son outraged by his mother's betrayal of his father; but it's inconsistent with that of a jealous son. Surely a jealous son wouldn't dither over killing Claudius. But the script shears off those inconsistencies, and the actors make it work.

She's a babysitter alone in a house with two children upstairs. An unknown man repeatedly calls, asking Have you checked the children? Eleven minutes later we get the grisly punchline, now well known and much parodied. The story jumps seven years. The caller was an insane killer (Tony Beckley), who has since been confined to a mental hospital. He escapes. A private detective (Charles Durning) is hired to catch him. Meanwhile the killer tries to pick up a woman in a bar. That woman is played by Colleen Dewhurst, a great actress who arrests our attention the moment she appears. She is menaced by the killer, but the story drops her character in the third act and returns to Kane.The script stinks of cheapness. The dialogue is flat. The characters are pawns of the plot and victims of the authors' estrangement from motivated human behavior. Why doesn't Kane check the children after the first call? Why isn't Dewhurst shocked and frightened when Beckley first appears at her apartment? Doesn't she realize he must have followed her in secret? Why does Durning want to kill the killer? Why does Durning issue the impotent threat of a search warrant to get into Dewhurst's apartment? Why does Dewhurst let him in anyway? For the killer we have a hundred whys. Beckley gives a fine portrayal of a desperate, tormented man; but we have no clues why he commits his crimes. The script's tautology he does insane things because he's insane.But the director deserves some credit. Even with a small budget and a bad script, Fred Walton gets good performances from a first-rate cast. He skillfully handles each sequence, wringing terror and dread from a bone-dry and boneheaded plot.And the remake? I probably won't bother. Remakes of old suspense thrillers are like children taken off Ritalin. They tear about at top speed with no apparent purpose. Just give me a few thousand bucks and a time machine set to 1979. I only want to make little changes. I want to reveal that grisly surprise right away. You heard me. And I have two reasons I'll sacrifice surprise for more suspense; and I'll prevent audiences from thinking this is a shaggy dog story that doesn't know when to quit. And I want Colleen Dewhurst to walk out of the bar without that silly exit line I don't why I keep coming back to this dump. And let me fix two editing mistakes. One is in that montage where Durning is passing around Beckley's photo. We're shown a man with a bandage covering half his face. Who is he, and why is he wearing a bandage? We'll never know. The other is in the scene where Durning searches for Beckley in the hostel. He shines a flashlight into a man's face; we cut to a close-up of Beckley, whom we assume is that same man. He isn't.Should you bother with this movie? Sure, if nothing else is on. Just keep your cell phone out of reach, or you'll occasionally want to throw it at the screen.

She's a babysitter alone in a house with two children upstairs. An unknown man repeatedly calls, asking Have you checked the children? Eleven minutes later we get the grisly punchline, now well known and much parodied. The story jumps seven years. The caller was an insane killer (Tony Beckley), who has since been confined to a mental hospital. He escapes. A private detective (Charles Durning) is hired to catch him. Meanwhile the killer tries to pick up a woman in a bar. That woman is played by Colleen Dewhurst, a great actress who arrests our attention the moment she appears. She is menaced by the killer, but the story drops her character in the third act and returns to Kane.The script stinks of cheapness. The dialogue is flat. The characters are pawns of the plot and victims of the authors' estrangement from motivated human behavior. Why doesn't Kane check the children after the first call? Why isn't Dewhurst shocked and frightened when Beckley first appears at her apartment? Doesn't she realize he must have followed her in secret? Why does Durning want to kill the killer? Why does Durning issue the impotent threat of a search warrant to get into Dewhurst's apartment? Why does Dewhurst let him in anyway? For the killer we have a hundred whys. Beckley gives a fine portrayal of a desperate, tormented man; but we have no clues why he commits his crimes. The script's tautology he does insane things because he's insane.But the director deserves some credit. Even with a small budget and a bad script, Fred Walton gets good performances from a first-rate cast. He skillfully handles each sequence, wringing terror and dread from a bone-dry and boneheaded plot.And the remake? I probably won't bother. Remakes of old suspense thrillers are like children taken off Ritalin. They tear about at top speed with no apparent purpose. Just give me a few thousand bucks and a time machine set to 1979. I only want to make little changes. I want to reveal that grisly surprise right away. You heard me. And I have two reasons I'll sacrifice surprise for more suspense; and I'll prevent audiences from thinking this is a shaggy dog story that doesn't know when to quit.

(Never mind Titus Andronicus with its parade of horrors, including a Texas Chainsaw-like scene where Queen Tamora is tricked into eating meat pies that contain her two sons. This once-loathed play probably now ranks above Hamlet.) Fans of this movie defend it by claiming that you don't see as much gore as you think you do. It's all artfully suggested by the director, Tobe Hooper, just as Alfred Hitchcock showed us a shower stabbing in Psycho without really showing a knife cutting into flesh.So what? First Psycho itself can be reasonably argued to have gone too far, just as King Lear can. (See Dr. Johnson.) Second The Texas Chainsaw Massacre does not differ from Psycho in degree. It differs in kind. Psycho is the story of a woman who becomes a thief in a moment of madness; and of the badly disturbed motel proprietor she meets while on the lam. The story includes scenes of violence and horror. This film does not have a story, and it's not about people. It *is* scenes of violence and horror.We meet five youths who are traveling in a van through a rural town two young women; three young men, one of whom is in a wheelchair. The man in the wheelchair is quirky but not interesting; the other four are colorless. The actor playing the invalid overacts; the actors playing the other four underact. The film contains one moment of humanity when one girl asks the other if she thinks there is anything to horoscopes. She answers, Everything means something.Not in this movie. The first twenty minutes are a build-up to the five youths getting stalked and murdered. The rest of it is them getting stalked and murdered. (Very similar, I've heard, to recent movies like Wolf Creek.) The main murderer is a retardate who wears a leather mask and squeals like a pig; the others are the members of his ghoulish hillbilly family, who like to dig up graves and make barbecue out of human flesh. We're plunged into a meaningless hell, and the only relief is the bad acting and the cartoonish implausibility of the killers.Sure, it's scary. Sure, Hooper is skillful at scaring us. But whatever Quentin Tarantino and other aesthetes of excrement might say, this isn't a real movie. At some point in the 1970s, the horror genre spawned a branch of pornography, and this is one of its rotten fruit. The distinction between horror movie and horror-porn can be blurry and somewhat arbitrary. But that's no excuse for not making it. Psycho has a shocking shower scene; Massacre is all shower scene.

I believe that these 2 children who have LOST their natural parents due to unknown means (never explained in the movie at least), are then further traumatized (possibly severely) by Quint and Jessel's relationship, and then are AGAIN traumatized by a woman they came to trust in the person of Miss Giddens.One person insinuated that it was actually more likely that Quint had abused the boy and Miss Jessel had ALLOWED him to in order to shield Flora...

The reviewer is right. While Pretty Woman was a repulsive story of gold-hearted whores, making a gajillion bucks from Gere-loving women looking for sweet, gold-plated romance, DTATW is an unfunny, unromantic, tedious story of pampered UMC types, circling around Gere, a befuddled and oh-so-handsome gynecologist who has a psychotic wife, two bordering-on-bizarre daughters, and a budding relationship with Helen Hunt, the only woman in Dallas who isn't a neurotic and hopelessly dependent hausfrau or wannabe.Other than the feeble attempt at providing some prurient pleasure for the boys with Farrah Fawcett and Helen Hunt naked (at different times) in the background, only a hopeless metrosexual could sit through this.

While Hitch's camera is always the best feature of his films, Herrmann is the artist who puts three of them over the top and into the realm of true greatness&#x97;setting them beyond such near-great movies as Notorious and Strangers on a Train, which both had good scores, but nothing like the sublime and haunting music of this film. There is no underestimating Hitchcock, nor the work of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, who play the film's two main characters; but without Herrmann this could not have been a great movie.The opening scene is the best place to appreciate both Herrmann and Hitchcock. Joseph Stefano's script is extremely well-structured and it was his idea to make Marion Crane the story's main character, before switching over forty minutes later to Norman Bates. (In the original novel, Robert Bloch dispatches Mary Crane much sooner.) But his dialogue is often stilted, and the opening scene, where Marion and Sam Loomis (John Gavin) share a lunchtime tryst in a cheap hotel, is badly written. The fault is made worse by Gavin, whose performance is stiff and awkward throughout, nowhere more than here. Yet this scene is among the glories of the movie, with the camera, the music and Janet Leigh's performance all giving it an aching poignancy that haunts our minds long after the film is over. Our sense of Marion's longing and frustration, which could not be conveyed by Leigh alone, is necessary for us to understand why she commits the rash act of stealing money from her boss's client. Watch how much is conveyed to us by the camera when Marion suddenly rises from the bed. Listen how much is conveyed by Herrmann's music when Sam spreads out his hands in mock-surrender and says, All right. The scene as written would seem unworkable in other hands; in the hands of Herrmann and Hitchcock (and Leigh) it becomes masterly.Gus Van Sant's remake, a fascinating failure, helps us appreciate many things about this film, including the performances&#x97;even, perversely, the performances of Gavin and Vera Miles, who plays Marion's sister, Lila. Gavin is incompetent and Miles is thoroughly competent, but both have the same effect on us we don't care about them. Or rather, we would be bored by them if they were doing anything other than solving the mystery of Marion's disappearance. Viggo Mortensen and Julianne Moore give these bland characters more dimension, and in doing so, annoy us with their distracting personalities. Characters that are deliberately featureless often excite our imaginations more than ones that are full of tedious quirks. As is so often true with old movies, their faults prove to be virtues when remakes attempt to correct them.Oddly, I vividly remember everything about the Van Sant film, except for Vince Vaughn's performance as Norman Bates; I only remember that at the time I thought it was excellent. Anne Heche, by contrast, was memorably awful, especially in the one scene that enhances our appreciation of Janet Leigh. When Marion is in her apartment alone (and without any monologue), packing her things and worrying about her mad plan, Leigh conveys all the anxiety in her decision with a minimum of affectation. But Heche not only makes the putrid decision to play the scene as if she is half-amused by her own craziness; she conveys this idea with the maximum of overplaying, as if she were compensating for her lack of dialogue with broad gestures and eye-rolling. Leigh shows us how she feels; Heche announces it over a megaphone.Anthony Perkins' performance as Norman Bates is among the most memorable ever recorded on film. He is sympathetic and frightening; innocent and malign; horrifyingly unlike us and even more horrifyingly like us. Stefano gives him the best lines; and Hitchcock's camera is preternaturally adept at drawing us into his world when necessary and then coldly keeping us distant when needed. Yet with all this, how much more than a satisfying thriller with a clever trick ending could Psycho have been without Herrmann's score to help it transcend itself? Could Norman Bates have haunted us as much with a merely excellent score, like the ones for Strangers on a Train and Frenzy? Neither Bloch nor Stefano is Shakespeare, and Norman Bates does not live on the page, as Macbeth, Edmund and Iago do. Could Norman Bates, like Shakespeare's characters, live for four-hundred more years? If he survives, it will have been the joint genius of Perkins, Hitchcock and Bernard Herrmann that rendered him, and his story, an immortal nightmare.

Good satires are much more rare. Satires that fooled everyone, from the audience to the actors playing in the film are toughest to find. Jingle All The Way achieves just that. By throwing a social commentary joke over the heads of audiences instead of into their minds, and then by delivering a biting message that stands just as true today as it did when it first came out, Jingle All The Way went from disappointment to one of the most realistic holiday films ever, despite its lack of realism. The hypocritical statements are flying in this first paragraph, but the truth is almost everyone missed the joke, the main picture. What looks like pure family fun turns into commentary with an attack on commercialism and the American public buying into the scheme. Even if you don't want to look into the deeper details, why skip out on Sinbad and The Terminator going at it?Jingle All The Way follows a workaholic dad by the name of Howard who disappoints his wife and son year after year. After missing another karate practice, Howard promises to not only show up at the parade the next day, but also get his son the TurboMan doll that is based off Jamie's favorite television show, favorite cereal, and favorite hero. The catch is simple it is impossible to find the doll since it's a massive hit. Not only that, but most shipments are not arriving on Christmas Eve (notice the setting getting a bit dangerous), therefore increasing the supply-and-demand. Howard is still determined to find the doll and not disappoint again. Christmas Eve turns into D-Day on the shores of stores across the nation.This sort of idea has always been present in television shows everywhere, but to take a simple concept and stretch it into a full-length motion picture is a challenge to the utmost level. Thankfully, we have good writing by Randy Kornfield, decent direction by Brian Levant, and the supervision of Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Harry Potter, Mrs. Doubtfire, Adventures in Babysitting). Looking past the seemingly heavy dosage of criticism against American society and Big Business, we see the cast throw our victim fathers into every possible awful and unfortunate scenario possible, and the range of ideas presented are amazing.Arnold Schwarzenegger must have a sense of humor, because he isn't afraid of embarrassing himself by getting beat up and pulverized by the holiday rush, a bitter mailman, and a Santa Claus that can scare blind children. His performance by no means is Oscar-worthy, but we see him with his determination like in his usual action films, but in a whole new arena, a totally different atmosphere, and that just adds a dosage of humor to the entire film. To see an action star have to claw his way out of a melee of people trying to get bouncy balls is priceless. Almost as rare as Schwarzenegger looking wimpy is Sinbad in a superb film. His performance as the disgruntled mailman just matches him perfectly, and his determination to get the doll is just as bad. Rounding out the cast is a bunch of underrated and\/or B-list stars like the brilliant Phil Hartman, Rita Wilson, Robert Conrad, and James Belushi.Why in the world would anyone want to skip a movie in which we see a rumble involving an angry dad and a bunch of Santa Claus frauds running an illegal toy-manufacturing\/distributing operation (Best scene of the movie for sure)? Why miss out on The Terminator take on a raging reindeer? Why skip out on a mailman posing as TurboMan's villain and flipping the bird to spectators during a family parade? With an endless amount of silly, over-the-top, brilliant moments in which represent Christmas at its truest, Jingle All The Way stands as the most realistic holiday movie ever, since it really shows what its all about. Forget the sappy messages you see in Christmas movies, it doesn't matter what you did, what illegal things you performed, how many assaults you have committed, as long as you get that gosh-darn toy for your child in Christmas, it will all be forgiven.Everything in this film, whether unintended or intentional, downplays the meaning of Christmas and all that goes on. There isn't a single decent Santa Claus in the film; they are all corrupt human beings with a different agenda. The stores are not trying to please anyone; they just want money for themselves and enjoy seeing people scrap for chances of earning a doll like starving dogs fighting over a hunk of meat. The main child doesn't say he wants his dad to stay home for Christmas, he says he wants a certain doll, and even recites the entire commercial, including the final words Batteries Not Included. Nobody is helping each other; everyone is fighting, pushing people towards aisles and toy displays. While the entire thing is comical, it truly does happen in the real world. There was even one pivotal scene in which Byron the mailman discusses the importance of getting that special gift; he compares himself to another child that got the hot item on a certain year. Byron is disappointed, grows up to become a loser; neighbor that gets the doll becomes a multi-millionaire.Can a Christmas without material possessions scar you and turn you into a loser? Or is it Commercial America making it seem that way? Is this film a perfect satire or did it accidentally become that way? While the clues are pointing towards lampoon, Levant looks like he really aimed for the heartfelt, emotional Christmas movie with the bittersweet ending. Instead, we get a film that predates (and apparently predicts) the Tickle Me Elmo, Pokemon, Playstation, and Furby holiday horror stories. From the campy introduction to the hysterical final showdown, it's a great movie for what it is, and after aging like fine wine, becomes something more&#151;accidental or not.

I'm guessing the film took some influence from the silly Sergio Martino film 'Island of the Fish Men' released a year earlier. The film was produced by low budget horror guru Roger Corman, but it's certainly a world away from the stuff he did earlier in his career; films such as those delightful Poe adaptations. Even though the film was directed by a woman, there's plenty of misogynistic violence in the film...although it does have to be said that it's difficult to take seriously. The plot follows the consequences of experiments done with DNA. A company has been playing around with frogs and salmon and stuff, and somehow this has lead to the creation of strange human-like amphibian things. This is bad news for the local fishing village; as their quiet existence is about to be threatened by these monsters, who have decided that raping human women is a favourite pastime...The special effects are as cheap as you would imagine they would be considering the penny-pinching producer, but the men in suits do actually look quite eerie and realistic, considering. The idea behind the monster design has clearly come from the classic Universal flick 'Creature from the Black Lagoon', and that immortal monster has been well stolen from. There's not a great of deal invention in this film, as even the explanation of how the monsters came about is underdone and only the idea of the monsters raping the women really shows any inventiveness as a lot of the film simply shows various people fighting the creatures. There is a fair amount of gore on display, which is nice; especially considering that this plot idea would normally have lead to a film more based on monster design than blood and guts. The ending can be seen coming a mile off, although it is strangely and perversely horrifying, thus making it memorable.

By the way, they are apparently in Britain, not America.After he goes to bed, Kevin is awakened by a group of little people led by Randall. They seem confused. First they think Kevin is their enemy and start beating on him. Then they realize he is just a kid. They need to find the way out, which they finally do, and just in time. They must run from a scary face resembling The Wizard of Oz when Dorothy and her friends first meet him. Kevin goes along.The group ends up in the middle of a battle being fought by Napoleon for a town in France. After the battle, Napoleon is entertained by a puppet show. He can't do anything requiring two hands--apparently the one must stay in his jacket.We learn that the little people travel through time and steal from the rich. After a meal with Napoleon, they take everything they can carry and escape through a time hole just ahead of Napoleon's army--who can't follow because the hole closes!The next destination is the time of Robin Hood. The outlaw is impressed with their philosophy but I doubt he would agree with robbing from the rich and giving to the poor--US! Randall has a map of the time holes, which he got from The Supreme Being. His every move is witnessed by The Evil Genius, who would like to have it so he can rule the world.At one point Kevin gets separated from the rest and ends up in a desert that is part of ancient Greece. The time travelers also sail on The Titanic and on the boat of the man-eating ogre Winston and his wife. They also witness numerous combat styles including modern tank warfare, futuristic space weapons, and Old West cowboys with ropes.The ending is weird, which is to be expected. A strange sequence of events.If John Cleese, Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam are involved, you know it will be funny with an edge. I have recently discovered Monty Python's Flying Circus on my PBS station, and while I don't have a genuine appreciation for the zaniness of this crew, I do enjoy their often bawdy humor. But this is still family-friendly, except for some violence which is essential to the plot. Just enough violence for concern, but not enough to keep most kids from watching.Cleese does a fine job as Robin Hood, but he isn't on for nearly long enough. Sean Connery is outstanding as the Greek king. I never saw him smile like that! He seems to be genuinely enjoying himself. Again, too small a role. Other fine performances come from David Rappaport as the leader of the little people, Ian Holm as Napoleon, David Warner as The Evil Genius and Ralph Richardson as The Supreme Being. And there is plenty of silliness from our diminutive heroes and from the minions of The Evil Genius. Plenty of clever writing too. And plenty of action.

That would be an inappropriate and highly inaccurate adjective. Some more accurate adjectives would include pretentious, dull, self-absorbed, uneven, tedious, and irritating. Don't give me the whole, it was all a dream excuse. That is one of the weakest of all plot line excuses, and a plot line excuse that is often reserved for these overly ambitious films that try to convey some sort philosophical, surreal aspect or meaning but fall flat because they're just a bunch of pretty colors, spooky sounds, and celebrity tits. It is quite clear that the plot is out of order and rearranged. In fact, one of the few endearing qualities of this two and a half hour mess is how elegantly that story was wrapped up. Those twists were effective and certainly had a lot of work put into them by Mr. Lynch. But is this movie really worth two and a half hours of our time to see a fairly good ending wrap up? In this case, no, it is not. Why? Because the vast majority of this meticulous, obnoxious, pompous movie is made up of pointless visual effects, shots that go on way past their expiration date, and uncomfortable, and, even worse, uninteresting dialog. And seeing Naomi Watts prance around with the attitude of a caffeine addicted, giddy moron with the off-kilter adrenaline dysfunction of a high school theater student makes me want to punch her in the scrawny face. It's that grating. Sure, there are some lovely ladies, some intriguing and artfully used shots and cinematography, and at times the psychedelic effects work. But not for the whole movie! This is a tiresome quagmire of a film. It's not confusing -- the elements that might seem confusing actually work fairly well. It's the fact that it's so full of itself, so poorly executed (for the most part), and so uneven that makes this film junk. It wants to be good. It wants to be provocative. It wants to be sexy. It wants to be deep and surreal. Sadly, this movie does not succeed in those goals. The good parts are rare and sparsely distributed. The provocative parts are tame. The bedroom scenes seems forced. The supposed deep quality is horribly shallow and unconvincing, and the surreal bits are unoriginal, irrelevant, and feel like the discarded remains of previous, better Lynch films. I would almost feel sorry for this mess, if it didn't annoy me so much. 4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"7 December 2006","score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" POTENTIAL SPOILERS WITHIN!!!!This movie is not confusing.

I guess it's the magic of Dino De Lauretis and his special sort of sleaze. Yeah. It has a special charm to it. The crew of this one, however, just doesn't have the same appeal and was something that I was hoping for the first time I saw this in theaters, but was deeply disappointed. ( And speaking of Conan, the ending is somewhat reminiscent of Conan's where the victor lurks over the kingdom by mountaintop. He did, however, knock his ass into a bowel of fire, which I guess the film theorizes is much more heroic than decapitation anyday. The only difference is that the Scorpion King is met w\/ WAY MORE praise than Conan ever was because the Scorpion King never chopped off their master's head in front of him. Of course the masses weren't as brainwashed w\/ the king's sorcery neither. More or less, this just happens to be a much more optimistic barbarian knock-off than Conan ever was.My favorite in-joke in this one, so far, was that the witch told the king that she had to remain a virgin in order for her powers to be intact. And she was lying thru her teeth too. That was just too cold! But about halfway into this, I was really skeptical of this chick's awesome. I mean her predictions were only half-right. However throughout half the flick, it makes it seem like she has an uncanny foresight, which is solely responsible for her lord's success.

Another friend said to me, It's nothing but high-class gambling. Stone captures the Wall Street greed and the multimillionaire young men who populated the brokerage houses back in the '80s before they started folding. Everything was about making money (which hasn't changed much) and having all the external trappings of success and happiness. We heard a lot about the yuppies back then, who were a lot different from the beatniks and the hippies, both of whom in their own way went against the system. The new youth, however, reveled in the system, and capitalism was their god.The character of Bud Fox, portrayed by Charlie Sheen, is just such a young man, struggling to make it in the brokerage world. Ambitious, he worms his way in to see a major wheeler-dealer takeover king, Gordon Gecko (Michael Douglas). Gecko gives Bud a try and teaches him about the good life, insider trading, spreading buys to other brokers, wiring money to an offshore account - all the time keeping his own hands clean. Gecko even sends an ex-girlfriend (Darryl Hannah) to keep Bud company. It takes a while, but when Gecko dupes Bud into helping him take over the airline where his father works, Bud realizes he was a patsy.This is a good movie that really captures the atmosphere of those times when I lived in New York - everyone was buying co-ops and condos and playing the stock market. As Bud learns, money isn't the only way to measure success, and greed and heartlessness aren't for everyone.Charlie Sheen gives a very good performance - he's well cast as is, of course, Martin Sheen as his wise father who has a different set of values and recognizes Gecko's motives even if his son doesn't. Michael Douglas is perfect as a complete bastard - and don't kid yourself, these types exist in abundance. In fact, I can't even say the Gecko character is exaggerated. He's a total slimeball. Darryl Hannah is fairly lousy as the girlfriend who is falling for Bud but whose future success is tied to Gecko.Martin Sheen is the only one who's really a likable character, so the film has a certain coldness. So does Wall Street, especially if you happen to be on the losing end.
