The bare-bones plot involves David having to retrieve a dinosaur bone for his museum from Susan's dog while the two try to manage Susan's pet leopard (the titular Baby). Presented via Hawk's trademark dry and no-frills directing style, Bringing Up Baby is an often funny but ultimately grating experience.The film has some great positives; it really shines in a few stand-out comedic scenes. One sees David attempting to save an ignorant Susan from embarrassment in a restaurant, and another an awkward dinner table scene that makes perfect use of dramatic irony for hilarious effect. Each of these scenes are meticulously crafted and extremely entertaining in their own right. To many critics, the film's box infamous office failure remains something of an enigma. Despite extremely positive reception from test screenings, the film failed to make its budget back during its initial run. Hawks himself felt the film had a great fault and I learned an awful lot from that. There were no normal people in it. Everyone you met was a screwball and since that time I have learned my lesson and I don't intend ever again to make everybody crazy. I agree. There isn't a single relatable feature in any of the film's characters, and as a result it feels emotionally void. We're supposed to believe that the gawky David needs the irresponsible Susan to show him how to have fun, and that Susan needs a man to marry, but the lack of any emotional investment means the film plays out unconvincingly and the plot feels simply set up in order to allow for crazy antics to happen.This isn't helped by the movie's cut-throat pace, which, while moving things along quickly, leaves little room for character and story development, and little breathing room for the audience. Combined with the constant machine-gun like barrage of words pouring from the actor's mouth, the movie can be quite irritating, even at its modest runtime of 102 minutes.In fact, Bringing Up Baby may be a film more interesting than entertaining. Typical of the screwball comedy, gender roles are reversed, with a male character of questionable masculinity suffering from a dominant woman who makes his life misery. Of course, they fall in love in at the end. What sets this film apart however, is Hawks' ability to take this reversal to new extremes. Martin Scorsese calls directors who manage to slip in messages pass censorship smugglers, and in Bringing Up Baby Hawk's luggage is positively stuffed. Having a great understanding of the genre after his film Twentieth Century (1934) acted as a prototype for it, Hawks uses phallic and fetishized imagery to chart his male protagonists' quest for manliness, the most obvious being the dinosaur bone, that, from a modern perspective, are quite shocking to see in a film made during a very conservative time in America. Also quite shocking is the amount of power women hold. David is almost always interrupted by a female character and its Susan's aunt who holds the million dollars that David needs for his museum, in addition to the bone. Hepburn's character is even seen wearing pants in a few scenes, not a dress or skirt. A rare sight in 1930s cinema. Furthermore, several historians believe the film contains one of the first mainstream uses of the word gay in a homosexual context, improvised by Grant during a very funny scene involving his character unwillingly wearing a women's négligée.Another very funny scene involves Grant's David trying to buy a large sirloin steak for the leopard. Perhaps the experience of watching Bringing Up Baby can be summarised by the experience of eating a giant steak. At first you're excited by the humour and innovation of having a steak so big, but after a reasonable number of bites, you just want to eat something else.

Murnau's film, which was made in 1922 and in many ways shows it, is the beginning of vampire films. Working with less precedence than all the horror film directors who followed him, Murnau helped shape the horror genre with choices that he made in presenting this story. Many of these still work very well, including the spooky shadow-on-the-wall sequence and the horizontal-to-vertical rise of the vampire from his coffin.Your enjoyment of this film, however, will not be determined solely by what Murnau did. Instead, it will be influenced by a number of factors. From a personal point of view, it will have to do with how you feel about vampire films in general, with whether you've seen the Herzog\/Kinski 1979 version of this film(which is absolutely wonderful), and with how your version of this classic is presented to you. In my case, for instance, I had to endure what was a truly horrible modern music soundtrack that Eureka Video felt entitled to inflict upon its customers, and clumsily translated intertitles as well. Were I to have seen this with better music (and it's hard to imagine that worse music could be found) and better translations of the original German caption-boards, I would have been spared some pain.However, these minor quibbles aside, the film is beautiful. The camera angles are innovative, the images are stunning, and although Gustav von Wangenheim as the Jonathan Harker wannabe Thomas Hutter is not a great actor, the rest of the cast, including Greta Schröder as his wife, Alexander Granach as the Renfield clone named Knock and, of course, Max Schreck (his name in German actually means fright or fear) as Count Orlok are all brilliant in their roles. As for exterior locations, the quaint Hanseatic towns of Lübeck and Wismar give the film added authenticity and period charm.Is it scary? Well, not so much today, but it's not really the fault of this film that we have come to recognise every convention it uses. After all, most of them are original to this film and have themselves been copied in the subsequent iterations that we've seen. and in any case, even where it is not scary, it remains deeply eerie. Is this film good? Very definitely yes, although on a personal level, if you asked me about early atmospheric films regarding vampires, I would have to admit that I prefer Carl Theodor Dreyer's Vampyr, filmed ten years later in 1932. Still, considering the advances made in the intervening decade, Murnau's earlier film is an incredible accomplishment. And Max Schreck, who would come back, thanks to Willem Dafoe, some seventy-eight years later to become an equally haunting if somewhat funnier character in E. Elias Merhige's Shadow of the Vampire, creates a horror archetype here that we have been living &#x96; and dying &#x96; with ever since.

And Max Schreck, who would come back, thanks to Willem Dafoe, some seventy-eight years later to become an equally haunting if somewhat funnier character in E.

Murnau's film, which was made in 1922 and in many ways shows it, is the beginning of vampire films. Working with less precedence than all the horror film directors who followed him, Murnau helped shape the horror genre with choices that he made in presenting this story. Many of these still work very well, including the spooky shadow-on-the-wall sequence and the horizontal-to-vertical rise of the vampire from his coffin.Your enjoyment of this film, however, will not be determined solely by what Murnau did.

Devoted fans of the real-life Aikido master will cheer their pony-tail hero as he demolishes his usual quota of thuggish villains who richly deserve every slap, smack, punch, and crackle they receive from Seagal as a way of atonement. What might upset them are the many variations that embellish this saga. No, The Glimmer Man isn't a message-laden, ecological nightmare that Seagal's earlier epic On Deadly Ground was. This Seagal vehicle grafts a creepy, whodunit, serial killer plot reminiscent of the 1995 Brad Pitt chiller Se7en onto a standard-issue police procedural. This time out we're allowed to laugh a little at the antics of Seagal and his newest sidekick, LAPD Detective Jim Campbell (Keenen Ivory Wayans of A Lone Down Dirty Shame), who gets to be the butt of our protagonist's pranks. The script allows Wayans to behave in a fashion that would appear inappropriate for the screen persona of Seagal's indestructible character. For instance, we get to see Wayans cry like a baby as he watches Casablanca in a downtown movie palace. Seagal's recent pictures have been overshadowed by his 1992 box office smash Under Siege. The Glimmer Man represents an appeal to a more broadly defined audience, but nevertheless, it is more a watchable than most of his far-fetched fare.Steven Seagal's Glimmer Man character Jack Cole replicates the cop that he played in his cinematic debut Hard to Kill 9(1988) who had a hazy background as a CIA agent. Here, Seagal plays an ex-CIA assassin who plied his trade during the Vietnam War. As usual, Cole suffered from the lone wolf, Dirty Harry, syndrome. Mystery cloaks Cole so thoroughly that Campbell (Wayans) cannot decide whether to trust him or arrest him. Gradually, our detective heroes discover that their suspicions about the serial murders are correct. They uncover an elaborate CIA\/Russian Mafia plot to smuggle chemical weapons into the U.S. in a most interesting and original manner. Complicating matters is the actual serial slayer, Christopher Maynard (Stephen Tobolowsky of Momento), who lives up to his weirdness. Frank Deverell (Bob Gunton of The Shawshank Redemption) is Seagal's chief adversary who masterminds the chemical weapons smuggling operation. As a CIA honcho, Mr. Smith (Brian Cox of The Long Kiss Goodnight) brings urbanity and a touch of Dixie to his duplicitous dastard. Cox makes such a impassive but slimy villain that he deserves the abuse that Seagal delivers with glee.The real fun in any Seagal epic is the incredible way that he crushes his adversaries without suffering any payback. Nothing in The Glimmer Man matches the far-fetched scene where he escapes the hoodlums right after he emerged from a coma and pushes his own gurney out of the hospital. Another change here is the joke-swapping rapport between Seabal and the impeccably tailored Wayans. Seagal characters aren't known for either their levity or their pranks. They are typically a humorless, moribund breed of hero. Keenen Ivory Wayans' presence helps to lighten things up in this bizarre thriller. He gets shot at, his apartment blown up, and he falls out of a high-rise motel window. Wayans looks and dresses ultra-cool but he gets no more respects and twice the number of bruises than Seagal.Underlying the complicated plot is the budding relationship between Cole and Campbell as they pursue their investigation in its bl00dsplattered, pyrotechnical explosive finale. The humor and antics that develop between these two make The Glimmer Man more interesting than the usual Seagal opus.

Bored, headstrong and resentful of her conformist parents, Charlotte hungers for excitement. She gets just this when her uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotton) visits. He's a serial killer. Nobody but Charlotte notices.A reversal of his Saboteur, which moved from California to New York, Doubt moves from the shadowy, decrepit world of New York City, to a small-town Californian paradise. A kind of precursor to the films of Nicholas Ray, Douglas Sirk and even David Lynch's Blue Velvet, Shadow then begins to peel back facades and take a look at America's actual social and moral landscape. Subverting Norman Rockwell idylls, with their white picket fences and picture-perfect All American Families, Hitchcock offers a world in which Bank of America towers loom ominously over small towns, and where almost all characters are dull materialists afflicted with a terrible loneliness.Into this world steps Charlotte, a teenager on the cusp of womanhood, budding breasts and all. She finds herself in her own little rights-of-passage, awakening to her newfound sexuality and also the existential hollowness of those around her. Nothing happens, she mourns. We eat and sleep and that's about it! Charlotte's father counters that they have money, but she cuts him off How can you talk about money when I'm talking about souls? In Hitchcock's films, the villain oft embodies temptations to which, on an unconscious level, the heroes have yielded or wish to yield. Think the tennis pro in Strangers on a Train who secretly wishes to rid himself of an inconvenient wife, an act which is actually acted upon by someone else. A similar situation takes place in Rear Window. In this way, a number of Hitch's films function as parables of sin and expiation.And so Charlotte and her namesake Charlie have a creepy relationship. They have a telepathic bond, he puts a wedding ring on her finger and sexual sparks fly whenever they're together. But Charlie then begins to reveal himself to be akin to the killers in Hitchcock's Rope. He views himself as being superior and above common, bourgeois men. Deeply nostalgic, he also has fantasies about returning to the gay ole 1890s, when things were better. Charlotte sympathises with these views, detests those around her, until Charlie reveals himself to be a monster. Charlotte recoils from this point onwards, as if catching a glimpse of herself in a mirror. We see here the seductively dangerous nature of nostalgia, specifically the reactionary kinship between conservatism (an idealised past) and sentimental liberalism, where, as author Dennis Grunes notes, the latter replaces the historical past with childhood as the object of adoration, converting it, too, into a pathological fetish. Charlie and Charlotte themselves function as shadows who have doubts. He views himself as the ideal male (potent adventurer, rugged individualist, American Hero), she as the ideal female (erotic woman, feisty), both contrasted with their shadows (the dull husband, the devoted mother etc), both contemptuous of bourgeois complacency and the unhappiness that arises from gender roles. The duo are linked from Hitchcock's very first shot, both actors' names side by side whilst couples circle in an intimate male\/female waltz. The film will eventually end with Charlotte transforming from an independent woman to a domesticated wife. In this way family is seen as threatening, a trap, no worse than outside.In the way Hitchcock muddies inside and outside the family, the film differs from many films of its era, which typically tried to shake viewers out of complacency by presenting idyllic families being infiltrated by evil, corrupting spectres (commies, fascists, creeps etc). Hitchcock, though, resists identification with the law, the authority, blurs the forces of good and evil, and paints normalcy itself as being something monstrous.Still, Charlotte's family members are a likable bunch. You have her adorable brother and sister, a passive father and a forlorn mother who constantly dotes on others. They counterpoint the headstrong, intelligent Charlotte, who symbolically dances Franz Lehar's Merry Widow waltz with Charlie, himself called the Merry Widow Murderer. But Charlie's aberrations &#x96; stemming from a childhood tragedy in which he almost died - don't differ much from the mainstream aberrations of Hitchcock's uber-conservative, American family. Indeed, Charlie believes himself to be but a more pure and honest manifestation of the greedy, soulless civilization he sees around him. Money's become more important than souls, he mourns, the man a sick distortion of a sound moral attitude.And so Hitchcock literally positions a church opposite a mega-bank and positions sociopathy as the extreme reactive consequence of a societal preoccupation with wealth and profit. Charlotte's father, a banker, himself relaxes by playing games of death, human beings comically reduced to objectifiable things or playthings, a game of death which Charlie later really plays with Charlotte. Elsewhere the film looks at the ruthlessness behind American benefaction Charlie's murder money is used for philanthropic funds, church's sing ironic praises about Charlie and civic good and bloodshed are continually intertwined. Later it becomes clear that Charlie is obsessed with dirty truths due to shattered idealisations, and that Charlotte lives in a false idyll which is slowly shattered but which she nevertheless wishes to preserve. Indeed, she willingly turns a serial killer into a phony martyr, all for a community's fragile self-image.

Bored, headstrong and resentful of her conformist parents, Charlotte hungers for excitement. She gets just this when her uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotton) visits. He's a serial killer. Nobody but Charlotte notices.A reversal of his Saboteur, which moved from California to New York, Doubt moves from the shadowy, decrepit world of New York City, to a small-town Californian paradise. A kind of precursor to the films of Nicholas Ray, Douglas Sirk and even David Lynch's Blue Velvet, Shadow then begins to peel back facades and take a look at America's actual social and moral landscape. Subverting Norman Rockwell idylls, with their white picket fences and picture-perfect All American Families, Hitchcock offers a world in which Bank of America towers loom ominously over small towns, and where almost all characters are dull materialists afflicted with a terrible loneliness.Into this world steps Charlotte, a teenager on the cusp of womanhood, budding breasts and all. She finds herself in her own little rights-of-passage, awakening to her newfound sexuality and also the existential hollowness of those around her. Nothing happens, she mourns. We eat and sleep and that's about it! Charlotte's father counters that they have money, but she cuts him off How can you talk about money when I'm talking about souls? In Hitchcock's films, the villain oft embodies temptations to which, on an unconscious level, the heroes have yielded or wish to yield. Think the tennis pro in Strangers on a Train who secretly wishes to rid himself of an inconvenient wife, an act which is actually acted upon by someone else. A similar situation takes place in Rear Window. In this way, a number of Hitch's films function as parables of sin and expiation.And so Charlotte and her namesake Charlie have a creepy relationship. They have a telepathic bond, he puts a wedding ring on her finger and sexual sparks fly whenever they're together. But Charlie then begins to reveal himself to be akin to the killers in Hitchcock's Rope. He views himself as being superior and above common, bourgeois men. Deeply nostalgic, he also has fantasies about returning to the gay ole 1890s, when things were better. Charlotte sympathises with these views, detests those around her, until Charlie reveals himself to be a monster. Charlotte recoils from this point onwards, as if catching a glimpse of herself in a mirror. We see here the seductively dangerous nature of nostalgia, specifically the reactionary kinship between conservatism (an idealised past) and sentimental liberalism, where, as author Dennis Grunes notes, the latter replaces the historical past with childhood as the object of adoration, converting it, too, into a pathological fetish. Charlie and Charlotte themselves function as shadows who have doubts. He views himself as the ideal male (potent adventurer, rugged individualist, American Hero), she as the ideal female (erotic woman, feisty), both contrasted with their shadows (the dull husband, the devoted mother etc), both contemptuous of bourgeois complacency and the unhappiness that arises from gender roles. The duo are linked from Hitchcock's very first shot, both actors' names side by side whilst couples circle in an intimate male\/female waltz. The film will eventually end with Charlotte transforming from an independent woman to a domesticated wife. In this way family is seen as threatening, a trap, no worse than outside.In the way Hitchcock muddies inside and outside the family, the film differs from many films of its era, which typically tried to shake viewers out of complacency by presenting idyllic families being infiltrated by evil, corrupting spectres (commies, fascists, creeps etc). Hitchcock, though, resists identification with the law, the authority, blurs the forces of good and evil, and paints normalcy itself as being something monstrous.Still, Charlotte's family members are a likable bunch. You have her adorable brother and sister, a passive father and a forlorn mother who constantly dotes on others. They counterpoint the headstrong, intelligent Charlotte, who symbolically dances Franz Lehar's Merry Widow waltz with Charlie, himself called the Merry Widow Murderer. But Charlie's aberrations &#x96; stemming from a childhood tragedy in which he almost died - don't differ much from the mainstream aberrations of Hitchcock's uber-conservative, American family. Indeed, Charlie believes himself to be but a more pure and honest manifestation of the greedy, soulless civilization he sees around him. Money's become more important than souls, he mourns, the man a sick distortion of a sound moral attitude.And so Hitchcock literally positions a church opposite a mega-bank and positions sociopathy as the extreme reactive consequence of a societal preoccupation with wealth and profit. Charlotte's father, a banker, himself relaxes by playing games of death, human beings comically reduced to objectifiable things or playthings, a game of death which Charlie later really plays with Charlotte. Elsewhere the film looks at the ruthlessness behind American benefaction Charlie's murder money is used for philanthropic funds, church's sing ironic praises about Charlie and civic good and bloodshed are continually intertwined. Later it becomes clear that Charlie is obsessed with dirty truths due to shattered idealisations, and that Charlotte lives in a false idyll which is slowly shattered but which she nevertheless wishes to preserve. Indeed, she willingly turns a serial killer into a phony martyr, all for a community's fragile self-image.
