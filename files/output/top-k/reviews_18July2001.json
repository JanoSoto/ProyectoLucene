Maybe it was his unconstructive and misguided lambasting of the modern masterpiece Fight Club, or maybe it's just all of Magnolia.  Could there be anything more self-indulgent than a three hour long character montage? And how painful it is.  It just keeps cutting and cutting and cutting as the music keeps looping and looping and looping, and it really FEELS like a montage.  Quirky as the concept may be, did any of the people responsible for putting the words final cut in Anderson's contract stop to think about just how exhausting and aggrivating it would be for an audience to watch a movie that moves at the montage's unnaturally rapid rate for three hours? Despite the amazing acting and (to an odd extent) well-developed characters, I couldn't help but leave the movie feeling more than just a little disappointed.  The idea that the film centers around a seemingly-unrelated group of characters who actually share a common thematic thread has been done before and done better (see Exotica). Though this film is not afraid to dive deep into each of its characters, Magnolia just doesn't have the payoff.  Forgive me, but after watching three hours of largely vague and cryptic dialog take place over an unusually annoying soundtrack (that loops the same tinny violins for half-hour chuncks at a time)in order to slowly and meanderingly develop sub-plots (as there is no real main plot to speak of)that are equally vague, I want some character resolution.  Well, if you want to see a movie that features well-developed characters that are involved in intriguing events that satisfactorily climax and fulfill the viewer, you'll only get 2\/3 of the equation from Magnolia.  And in a way, that's even more cruel than if the movie were just flat-out bad.  It seems as though Magnolia spends three hours building up epically and enthrallingly to a grand conclusion and then... the credits roll.  I understand how the frog thing is a metaphor for man's absurdity, and that all these characters that fight for control are leading themselves in futility and the magic factor of the unpredictable and blah blah blah... and that's all well and good, but it doesn't make up for the fact that you never know what the heck happens to any of the characters and their situations after that takes place.  Oh sure, there are quick little subtle things that take place and successfully tie up the most desperately dangling elements of the plot, and there are some hints at changes in the characters, but it's almost like the movie is actually six hours long and everybody only has the first half. It seems like it should keep right on going and it just stops.  Almost everything is left hanging.  None of the cryptic dialogue is made clearer, the characters are not given just resolution, there is no significant lesson to be learned, and there is in fact little more than disappointment.  The whole movie, you sit there and think Okay, this is interesting... where are they going with this?... and in the end you realize the horrible truth nowhere.  And that's when I begin to think about P.T. Anderson's self-indulgence... I can't help but think of him dancing around on the DVD documentary as he is editing the film, gleefully spouting lines about how people won't understand it.  He is truly like a kid at play, and it shows, because in the end none of the work is done.  He tries so hard to deliberately attempt to break every formula possible, even the formula of storytelling, which may be good for the dancing director, but becomes agony for the poor, disappointed audience. * * ","genre":null},{"date":"18 July 2001","score":"5 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":"  For some reason, when I hear self-indulgent, I think Paul Thomas Anderson.

The peculiar plot, based not on someone taking over the Galaxy but over some trade difficulties (that came to the attention of the GTO, the Galaxy Trade Organization, I presume) that might've come out of Kissenger's DIPLOMACY. Unfamiliar characters, in the main, except for R2D2, Yoda and Palpatine (other familiar characters we know appear, but in such different incarnations that they're unfamiliar), make the movie a little less accessible than the last two Star Wars movies.The film contains many weaknesses.  The most glaring and often indicated is the Rastafarian Jar-Jar, perhaps the most annoying character in movie history.  Yet the kiddies loved him, so perhaps Lucas knew what he was doing (making money-wise, and that's what movies are all about).  The pod race is also annoying -- not the race so much as 1) the announcer, who sounds like he couldn't make it in NASCAR, and 2) the fact that we know who's going to win.

It's a kind of create-as-you-go market, and it's hard to go wrong, especially with the special effects and technology available today.  Mixing fantasy and comedy, however, is a whole different thing, and even in the abstract it is bound to wind up in a very subjective arena, and to be successful it must be created and presented with great care, vision and an innate sense of what works by the filmmaker.  `Monkeybone,' directed by Henry Selick and written by Sam Hamm is-- well-- none of those things, which is unfortunate for everyone involved with the project, but mostly for the unsuspecting audience upon which it is sprung.\tThe movie begins with a short `Monkeybone' cartoon, a pilot created from a popular comic strip written by Stu Miley (Brendan Fraser), which has just been picked up by Comedy Central and contracted for a number of episodes.  The cartoon depicts the origins of Monkeybone himself, and the appeal is purely infantile (and that's being kind).  After the premiere of this animated masterpiece, Stu attends the promo party with his girlfriend, Dr. Julie McElroy (Bridget Fonda), who is indirectly responsible for the existence of Monkeybone in the first place.  Stu had suffered from a sleep disorder due to nightmares since he could remember, and it was Dr. Julie who turned his life around, treating him at the sleep clinic into which he checked himself when he finally couldn't take it anymore.  At that point in his life, Stu's cartoons ranged from the gruesome to the downright disturbed-- all extensions of his nightmares; then Julie suggested drawing with his left hand instead of his right, and the result was the emergence of Monkeybone, who apparently is supposed to be the flip side of his nightmares.  Which may be true for Stu, but not necessarily for the audience.\tMonkeybone himself (with voice provided by John Turturro sounding like he's been inhaling helium), is-- far from being funny, cute or endearing in any way, shape or form-- an annoying little spud who grates on the senses from the moment he appears on screen, which beyond the opening cartoon, begins with Stu's descent into `Down Town,' the land of nightmares residing within his own mind into which he slips when a freak accident puts him in a coma.  It's a freakish place, a kind of demented `Toon Town,' populated by (besides the ever-present and irritating Monkeybone) such illustrious  nightmare mongers as Edgar Allan Poe, Jack the Ripper, Lizzy Borden, Attila the Hun and Stephen King (yes, the real King, in a cameo appearance).  The crux of Stu's problem is that he has to get his hands on an `Exit Pass,' in order to defy Death (Whoopi Goldberg), and make his escape back into the land of the living.  \tBrendan Fraser has to be given credit for not being afraid to take on challenging (some would say questionable) roles; from the comic antics of `George of the Jungle,' to the comedy\/drama of `With Honors,' to the action-packed `Mummy' films that have been so successful.  Overall, he's made a career out of taking chances and ferreting out parts that have quite effectively showcased his versatility and talent as an actor.  And it's easy to understand why this vehicle would've appealed to him.  On paper, at least, it probably looked like it would work; and Stu, as written, probably seemed like a character that would give him another opportunity to spread his wings and show some range.  Unfortunately, it's a long, long journey from script to screen, as they say.  And even an Oscar worthy performance in this case (and it wasn't) couldn't have saved the day.  The best that can be said is that Fraser did as well as anyone could have with the material he was given.\tAs for Bridget Fonda, one has to ask how an actor of her caliber gets caught up in such a thankless, generic role as this, which served the story as little more than fancy window dressing.  Fonda is simply too good and too deserving of better than to wind up in a part as forgettable as this.  But then again, it may have looked good on paper.  We'll call it that.\tThe supporting cast includes Chris Kattan (Organ Donor Stu), Giancarlo Esposito (Hypnos), Rose McGowan (Kitty), Dave Foley (Herb), Megan Mullally (Kimmy) and Lisa Zane (Medusa).  Sometimes it's fun to just relax and watch a movie that doesn't require much effort or thought and just lets you roll with the flow, but `Monkeybone' isn't one of them.  This is the one that never should have made it past the first draft of the screenplay, and Fraser and Fonda should invest in some white-out to try and expunge this from their respective filmographies.  There's magic in the movies, but not when the wires are exposed and you can see the trap door in the stage.  So file this one under `Sorry-- but try again,' and we can all move on to bigger, better and happier times.  I rate this one 1\/10.

It's something i'm sure you have already heard before NO this isn't as good as Jurassic Park.  NO this isn't Spielberg and Chrichton anymore.  NO it doesn't have a moving storyline, nor complex character development. Did you really expect it to?I'll admit I'm a bit of a movie elitist, often looking down on my friends when they jet off on a Friday night to see the brand new blockbuster. And they look down on me when i try and convince them that subtitles aren't all that bad.  But i was excited about this movie.  I was excited because i had no expectations whatsoever (after The Lost World, who could?).  No, wait, i did have one expectation i wanted to see dinosaurs run amok and eat people. If you go to the theater expecting that, i promise you won't be disappointed.  Let's face it folks, Jurassic Park is dead.  With the first film an action film icon, and the second one the butt of all sequel jokes, Joe Johnston had quite a job ahead of him.  How could a director pit his action scenes up against the same man who did Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Jurassic Park?  It's impossible.  So instead of going to this film and constantly comparing every nuance to Chrichton's dinos, or Spielberg's directing, just relax, pop a few Valium, and watch dinos attack things and munch on people. I did, and i came away feeling ok.I enjoyed the pterodactyl scene very much, it was probably the best action sequence in the film.  Johnston manages to orchestrate some suspense while at the same time introducing a new dinosaur that doesn't try to out do the others.  That was the reason the new Spinosaurus lacks some chutzpah, because he's just a meaner T-Rex with a different snout.  Ah, but flying dinosaurs we haven't dealt with yet. There's several lighter moments which actually don't hurt the film, as well as a handful of references to the past two films which keeps the fans interested.  True, the plot's thin, as well as the characters, but Alan Grant (Sam Neill) is a much more enjoyable (and believable) protagonist than The Lost World's Ian Malcom (Jeff Goldblum).  I would say that a rugged paleontologist has a better reason to be facing off against dinos than a quirky mathmatician.So if you're dead set on spending the afternoon watching something intellectually stimulating and though provoking, better not see this movie. But if your eyes have started to hurt from subtitles, and you've had a strange desire to see large lizards create panic and terror, then this is the movie for you.  Remember, no expectations, and there will be no regrets.

I think Eddie is still considered the king among comedy actors, or at least in the upper tier along with Jim Carrey and Robin Williams. Lawrence has had some success in the past, but nothing to match Eddie Murphy, so when a script comes along that allows Lawrence to jump into a big body suit and become a large, elderly woman, he jumps at the chance.The straight forward plot is that Lawrence plays FBI agent Malcolm Turner who is tracking a dangerous escaped convict named Lester. The FBI figures that Lester is going to go straight to his ex-girlfriend Sherry (Nia Long) since she was a suspect in a robbery he pulled off couple years ago, but it was something they couldn't prove. Sherry heads to Big Momma's house, and when Big Momma unexpectedly goes off to a friend's house for a couple of weeks, Malcolm becomes Big Momma. And of course along the way, Malcolm also meets Sherry as himself, and starts to fall in love with her. Good guys win, Bad guys lose, and Love survives the day. It's not like this is a story we haven't seen a thousand times before. So of course the big draw to this film is the chance to see Martin Lawrence dress up and act like an elderly woman. Which of course was one of the best scenes in The Nutty Professor when Eddie Murphy dressed up like his entire family. So seeing something like this isn't new, and on top of that, Lawrence is going to have to try and outdo Murphy in order for people to see this movie as funny. And personally, I think he fell short. First off, I can't believe that Big Momma could live in a small town for her entire life, and then all of a sudden have Martin Lawrence play her, and no one notices. Not her best friends, not her lover, not her grandchild, no one. All of a sudden a woman who has to run to the bathroom every five minutes can play basketball in the park? And no one says anything? Come on... On top of that, while I do enjoy Martin Lawrence (especially in his best film, Blue Streak), he can't hold a candle to Eddie Murphy. Most of the humor from this movie came from a toilet scene, and sexual humor dealing with a flashlight in bed. And there were some continuity errors I spotted as well. First there was duct tape, and then there wasn't. He goes to bed with a moustache, and wakes up without one. The comedic scenes were too few and far between to make this movie funny. The plot wasn't going to help pick it up, as it was something, like I said earlier, we've all seen before. And even if I try not to compare Lawrence to Murphy, I still don't think the movie was that good, and I didn't think Lawrence's portrayal of a large, elderly woman came off that well.  On the other hand, the supporting cast was pretty good. Nia Long looking spectacular in the stock role of the woman. Paul Giamatti in the stock role of the partner was funny in a been there done that type of role. Terrence Howard as Lester the convict was dutifully scary. And of course Ella Mitchell as the original Big Momma was a lot funnier than Martin Lawrence as Big Momma. And I'm not saying Lawrence was bad necessarily, just that the movie itself wasn't written all that well, and there really wasn't a whole lot Lawrence could do as Big Momma. There wasn't enough of a story for him to let loose and go crazy. Seeing a large, elderly woman play basketball and do karate is only funny for a couple of seconds. So overall I thought Big Momma's House was just an OK movie. It had some funny scenes, the cast was good, but the story was nothing special and in the end that hurt the comedic value of the film.

James O'Barr (the creator of The Crow) wanted nothing to do with it. Alex Proyas (the director of the original) was sickened for the same reason as I The creators of COA actually digitally altered the poster, to make Vincent Perez to look more like Brandon Lee. That's a line that shouldn't be crossed.If you want to see a better sequel, see The Crow Salvation. Wasn't anywhere near perfect, but should've been released theatrically, instead of this stinker. Oh well, at least this isn't as bad as the atrocity known as The Crow Stairway to Heaven.

Based on comments I'd heard from friends, I went in with pretty high expectations, and I was still impressed with the visual wizardry. This movie brings home the fact that this technology is probably only a few years away from being really dangerous-- I hope that audiences take a second to try and imagine the potential social and political chaos that could ensue when digitally created images make the small steps left in becoming indistinguishable from reality. Oh right, this is supposed to be a movie review...Final Fantasy The Spirits Within is a wondrous feat of computer animation, but I won't say it's a great movie (I give it a 7 or 7.5 overall). The plot is pretty basic, the dialogue even more basic, character development is weak, and even with the great look, there is something cold and empty about watching something so close to real that still isn't (the same problem I had with Shrek's Cameron Diaz's character). Maybe it's the use of very recognizable voices (Woods, Baldwin, Buscemi, Sutherland, etc.), but I found myself wanting to see the real face, just so I could actually connect with the characters. Basically, I'll admit that the high rating is largely because of what I feel to be simply unparalleled animation effects. There are some cool scenes that would do good live action justice, and the story does have some interesting ideas, but this movie ultimately rests on the fact that just about every scene is fascinating to watch for novelty's sake. In a few years, when this kind of animation looks like Pong to today's videogamers, Final Fantasy will be a ho hum title. Right now, it is pretty neat stuff, definitely worth a watch or two.

Let's face it, when people go to a dinosaur movie, what do they want to see?  Dinosaurs fighting people & eachother.  The first one seemed to have little of that element compared to the second, which incidently had the worst story of all.Simply put, Jurassic Park III is a dinosaur movie.  Lots of action, lots of dinosaurs, special effects which are top of the line, and just plain fun to watch.  In fact, Jurassic Park III only had enough story to put the people on the island.  This is to its credit.  I give Jurassic Park III, 9 out of 10 stars.  What can I say, I just had a darn good time while I was watching it.
