[{"date":"13 December 1998","score":"","review":"  PATCH ADAMS can best be described with one word....EXCELLENT! Robin Williams' performance takes us through a whole range of emotions and back again.  It's the first movie I've seen in *years* where the audience applauded at the end of the movie.  You can see Robin's true human spirit and compassion in scenes with the 'cancer ward' kids.  He is a wonderful person...the best choice for such a role.  Dr Adams is to be commended for all he went through to get where he is today.  Watch this movie, and you'll know why.
