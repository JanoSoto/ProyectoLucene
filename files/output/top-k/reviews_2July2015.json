If you DO enjoy the opposite, however, then chances are this movie will be for you.Road to Perdition is a very decent gangster\/mob film that sees Tom Hanks playing the role of Michael Sullivan, a family man who's grown up in the world of organised crime, and is the adopted son of mob boss John Rooney (played excellently by Paul Newman). However, when Sullivan's eldest son, Michael, sees something he shouldn't, family ties are forgotten and both father and son end up on the run fighting for their survival.I enjoy a good gangster\/mob film myself, and while Road to Perdition isn't anywhere near the same level as The Godfather, A Bronx Tale, or Casino, it's still a very good film to watch & enjoy. The story is structured well, the cinematography & direction are excellent, there's a nice amount of tension at just the right moments, and the acting is 1st class. There are even a few moments of humour as well just to break up the seriousness of the film.Speaking of the acting...Paul Newman, Jude Law, and Tom Hanks are all excellent in their roles here, and Hanks once again shows just how versatile an actor he really is when it comes to the different roles he plays as you'd never think that Forrest Gump could play a 1930s American gangster.However, even with all the pluses that this film has, it does lack a certain something to stop it from taking it to that next level for me. What that certain something is, though, I can't quite pinpoint.Anyway, regardless of that certain something, Road to Perdition is still a very enjoyable flick, and if you've not seen it yet...where the Hell have you been for the last 13 years??

Originally, the film was to include two Terminators, one of which would have been a liquid type (later used in T2). He later changed it to just one. He sold the rights to Gale Anne Hurd for $1. Literally. Anyway, in 1984, the film was released to rave reviews. By that, I mean it has an 8.1 on IMDb and a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. If that's not rave, I don't know what is. So, let's see if the critics are right or if they're just nutcases.The Terminator follows unassuming Sarah Connor as her life is turned upside down by a man claiming he's from the future to protect her, and a man who is part cyborg whom is trying to kill her to prevent a future war from ever beginning.To be honest, until today, I had never seen any of the Terminator films. I had heard many praise them and had heard a lot of good things about them but had never seen them. Now that I've seen one, I can definitely say that all the things people have said about the Terminator films being good are true.The acting is pretty well done from everyone. Arnold Schwarzenegger has that robotic feel to him already so he obviously does a great job as The Terminator, saying some truly hilarious lines like the scene where he says Fuck you, asshole. Just brilliant. Michael Biehn does a great job as a man coming from the future to protect Sarah Connor at the advice of her future son, John Connor. Don't expect me to explain that one to you, go watch the movie. Linda Hamilton does a great job as well portraying the woman trying to come to grips with what a man from the future is telling her, believe me, I know how weird this sounds, haha. Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen do good in their somewhat-limited roles as the detectives assigned to Sarah's case.The music by Brad Fiedel is awesome. The music over the opening credits is really cool, and although it's expanded upon a lot more in future sequels, the original ain't bad either. The cool thing about the score is that it's not just the big action sounding score, it has some emotional music in it too. Always nice to have diversity. The visual effects are great in this film, especially for a film released in 1984. At the end of the film, the film uses stopmotion and other effects to great lengths. It all looks quite natural and works very well.The cinematography from Adam Greenberg looks awesome, and makes the film look the part of a basic chase through the streets of Los Angeles. It's pretty darn cool. The script, too, is written very well, written mainly by Cameron (even though Hurd got a writing credit too), and is very tight. It manages to restrict the film to it's chases and a few different places where the characters spend anywhere from 5-10 minutes. It's very cost-effective, especially since the film was only made on a $6.4 million budget.Perhaps my only problem with the film (I know, shocking, I have issues), is that the first thirty minutes or so before the club scene are a little slow-moving and it really does take a while for the film to kick into gear. It's not a big problem, really, just me nitpicking, but it did bug me a bit.Overall, The Terminator is a fantastic action thriller. While the film's first act moves a bit slow, the effects are ahead of it's time, and the acting, music, cinematography and script all are just as fantastic. I'm so excited now to watch the next Terminator film, especially since I just saw a fantastic one, and people say the next one is even better.

A few months later we watched it all the way through and I was hooked. I love the British humor and it is definitely not a boring movie as it is filled with innuendo and good humor. I will say that British humor is not for everyone, but I absolutely love it! The way it is laid out can be a little confusing at times, and some random things do happen but it all seems to make sense at the end of the movie, but what movie doesn't do that. Or any TV show for that matter ha ha!There is a bit of blood in some scenes that may annoy some people but when you see it you can obviously tell that it is fake, what with how they portray it. But, all in all, love this movie! ","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy"}]
