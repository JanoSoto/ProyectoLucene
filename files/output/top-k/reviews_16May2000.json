But they are getting better.Romeo Must Die is about revenge, betrayal, love and honor. Han Sing (Jet Li) is an ex-cop that comes over to America to seek revenge for the death of his little brother. In the process of finding his brother's killer, he meets a beautiful woman that turns out to be from the family of the rival gang suspected of killing Sing's little brother. To complicate things, the suspected killer could very well come from within the family but the two of them work together despite the serious repercussions if they are caught together.I say that this is an improvement over Li's other work but I think that there is still a lot of room for improvement. Li's english has improved dramatically and he looks to be more comfortable with the english language and acting in Hollywood movies. I'm not one to dwell on fight scenes but let's be honest. This movie's main attraction was Jet Li and his martial arts skills so fight scenes become a pretty major focus. The weak part of this movie lies in the use of camera angles. The cameras are still too tight during the fight scenes and what you end up with is flashes of an arm here or a leg there. The effect of the fight scenes is totally lost, as the audience can't exactly see what is going on. Mind you there were some scenes (fire hose scene) that were done well but the final fight scene could have been much better. If you want to see some fantastic fight scenes, rent Fists of Fury. It's an older Li film redubbed in English for North America but awesome for good fight scenes.This is my first exposure to Aaliyah (rival gang head's daughter) and I have to say that I was impressed. She didn't come across as awkward or melodramatic (like other singer turned actors) and created an innocent believable attraction towards Li's character. They also did some interesting things with computer graphics but they may have been a bit too technology focussed in some parts.Overall, the story wasn't bad and most of the acting was pretty good. But my biggest beef with this movie was the way the fight scenes were filmed. If they improved that, this movie would have been better.

Characters, dialogue, action and acting all reminded me of nothing so much as a Saturday-morning, Transformers-type cartoon specifically targeting 5-year-old boys. Directed by Roger Christian (who's made a career of shlocky losers) Battlefield Urrrp manages to give banality a bad name. The protagonist is named Jonnie Goodboy Tyler. No I'm not making that name up. He lives with his honey as part of a very small tribe of renegades in the year 3,000. Being very brave, he wanders fearlessly close to `the gods' and is of course captured by the aliens. Ah, the aliens. That would be Terl (John Travolta) and Ker (Forest Whittaker). To make them appear very tall, they're obviously walking on huge platform boots. This is obvious because their walk is, literally, stilted and laughably awkward. In fact, I found myself constantly expecting them to start saying `Ni!' since they seemed very much like Monty Python's Knights Who Say Ni! In one of many paradoxes in the film, here are aliens from a race so advanced they were able to wipe out the entire planet in exactly 9 (not 8 or 10, mind you but 9) minutes, way back in the 21st Century, yet they obviously know nothing of personal hygiene and all of them are in desperate need of basic dental work. Even the names would do Saturday-morning cartoons justice. The aliens are Psychlos from the planet Psychlo! I am not making this up, either. And these highly intelligent beings call humans `man-animals.' Of course, when they catch man-animal Jonnie Goodboy Tyler, they come to find they've met their match. Had Ed Wood received the astounding $80 million budget of Battlefield Earth to spend on Plan Nine from Outer Space, this is probably what he'd have done with it. If nothing else, with that budget, the effects should have been awesome. Or even good. But they were just plain cheesy - laughable and low-budget in appearance. One of the funniest moments occurs when the very bad Travolta drops a man-animal down an abyssal chasm to see if it can fly. The way the hapless fellow falls, lying on his back, looking up and waving his arms - allllll the way down - made me feel I was watching a 1950s-vintage flick. Rip-offs of other films abound, but it's as if someone decided to rip off all the worst aspects of sci-fi films from recent years. Jonnie figures out how to beat the seemingly invincible aliens and part of his scheme requires his band of wild, uneducated man-animal workers to learn how to fly the United States' most sophisticated jets from 2000 (they know just where to find lots of them, of course). Sure enough, Jonnie leads them to an old training module; each one sets a spell in it and comes out an incredible ace fighter pilot, despite having never even seen a jet before. Never mind that after 1,000 years these birds might not start right up (even if the jet fuel were any good). Never mind that these same planes and even much more powerful weapons, during the invasion 1,000 years ago, had absolutely no effect on the invaders' technology. Now, suddenly, these jets are deadly - knocking the transplanetary craft unerringly out of the sky. Hell, the wild, loin-clothed man-animals must have learned jargon in the training module, too, so they suddenly spout marvelously incongruous lines like, `Hang on! I'm right on his tail!' The acting was as laughable as the plot. Travolta's forced `evil laugh' matched the special effects for cheesiness. And, certainly, Forest Whittaker has never been so ridiculous. Both actors spend the film varying between malevolent smiles and evil sneers; that's the range of their performances. Of course, if their heart wasn't in it, who could blame them with dialogue that would have made the Power Rangers sound childish. `Man-animals operating machinery?' asks alien Whittaker to Travolta, aliens technologically light-years ahead of Earth, from a race which freely traverses galaxies, `Have you blown a head gasket?' But if the aliens are petty villains, the wild humans surviving in `the hills,' are profound. Such as man-animal Jonnie Goodboy's woman-animal who says to him, `Jonnie, I've always known you don't believe in fate, but I've always known this will be our destiny.' (And she does it with a straight face!) As if all this weren't bad enough, the cinematographer apparently wanted to do his part in making the film worse - by inexplicably shooting scenes throughout the film with the camera tilted - at up to 45 degrees.  I kept waiting for the actors to start sliding right out of the frame! And apparently the editor's idea of action means `fast cuts.' The cuts were so fast, in fact, that during what could have been at least marginally interesting fight scenes, all we got were muddled flashes back and forth so quickly that we knew fighting was going on but couldn't follow any of it - until it was over, at which point we had no idea how the winner prevailed. Before the film came out, some controversy erupted over the fact that this movie was nothing more than an insidious ploy to spread Hubbard's (and Travolta's) religion of Scientology.

So I left again, and walked to a nearby bookstore to wait through the remaining 20 minutes. Maybe I am not qualified to review this movie since I didn't even see half of it, but the fact that I never walk out of movies--this was only the second in 25 years--should say something. And I walked out of this one TWICE.

He wanted to go in and be a dictator, go in and tell the student's to do this and do that. But after speaking to his wife he learned how to make it fun by relating what he wanted to teach to things the students liked. The issue with the girl who was bad at playing the clarinet, he pulled her aside and used his time (i.e. After school) to teach the girl. I think this is a good way of getting students to catch up to the rest of the class. If you truly want to be a good teacher you have to put in the time during your own time. If I have students lagging behind I don't plan to stop the whole class and teach at their level because that is not fair to the smarter students. I would assign different work, give extra help to the students who are finding it tough until they have an understanding and do the same level of work the smart kids are. Mr.Holland was motivated by his wife, I can't recall their conversation but she said something to him that made him tick that he had to teach on a different level. I don't know how to get teachers who have lost interest in the job to become motivated again. Maybe for these teachers it is better if they give the job up and move onto something that they are highly motivated to do. Maybe they could ask the student's how they want to learn it could turn out that their definition of fun is yours and that could re-light the spark that has gone. I believe that this is a true interruption of teaching, of course not all teachers but I would bet that there were and are teachers who are completely frustrated by the job and want to give it in straight away without really giving it ago. That those teachers find something that makes them get up in the morning and really look forward to going to work and being infront of those students. I don't have the magic answer to what that is because I think that it is a personal thing that in no way is the same for everyone. We all need to find what makes us go, we are all here now learning to be teachers so we all have some sort of drive to be here, we just have to keep that drive going when we graduate and get a job and then I think we'll all make excellent teachers. I think I've gone on enough now, if anyone wants to discuss what I wrote I look forward to reading your letter. After all that's what this discussion list is all about. Ken Sinderberry.
