I took this opportunity, though it wouldn't have been a great loss if I hadn't, as it was a pretty underwhelming experience. (I would probably still know nothing about this film to this day if I didn't know about it coming on TV.) This summer will mark two years since I first saw the film, and I have given it another try. Sometimes, films can improve with a second viewing, but for me, that was not the case with The Whole Nine Yards, so I highly doubt I will ever be watching it a third time.Nicholas Oz Oseransky is an American dentist who currently lives in Montréal, Québec, Canada with his French-Canadian wife, Sophie. Sadly, Sophie is one horrible, self-centred, freeloading woman who makes Oz's life miserable, and he cannot divorce her until he finishes paying off his debts! Things only get worse for the poor dentist when Jimmy The Tulip Tudeski, a hit-man from Chicago, moves in next door! The mob now want Tudeski dead for ratting them out, so he is now taking refuge in Montréal, under a new name, Jimmy Jones, but Oz soon figures out who he really is! When Sophie learns about Jimmy and why he's here, she has a new plan, for her own personal gain, of course! She sends Oz to Chicago to tell the mob where to find Jimmy, and he goes after she threatens to make his life even more miserable if he doesn't! After he leaves, Sophie tells Jimmy about why he has gone to Chicago behind his back, as she can make even more money if her husband is killed! Since this movie is a comedy, I was obviously hoping for some good laughs, which I didn't get. The second time I watched it, some parts definitely sparked a smile, and a VERY rare snicker, but none of these scenes are too memorable. When the gags aren't mediocre, they're usually lame, like when Oz throws up. The Sophie character is supposed to be funny, and so is the conflict between the couple, but both are actually pretty annoying, and I felt a little uncomfortable during the scenes involving her. Since it's a mob film, one would also hope for a decent amount of suspense, and there is a bit of that here, but not enough. More than one thing makes the story awkward, including the marriage. Either Sophie hid her true personality very well before they got married, or Oz was just really stupid, and I think a conversation at one point in the film suggests the latter! With all these problems, The Whole Nine Yards was a disappointment coming out the year after Analyze This, a superior gangster comedy.

In fact, it seems no matter how they try, they just can't make 'em like they used to.Sydney Pollack's remake of the 1954 romantic - comedy Sabrina from Billy Wilder is as flat as a tack in this 90's setting. Absolutely nothing works for Pollack or new screenwriters Barbara Benedek and David Rayfiel. This sort of film just does not suit the style that so complimented the likes of While You Were Sleeping and Sleepless in Seattle. There are so many things wrong with this pic I could go on forever about what has no effect.Harrison Ford is no Bogart. Though I consider him to be a fine actor, Sabrina is proof he is not a romantic lead. Ford is unable to make any impact as hard-nosed business man Linus Larrabee, and everything he tries fails, including all his comic moments and any intimate scenes with Julia Ormond, who, by the way, is no Audrey Hepburn. Miss Ormond is no more Sabrina than Danny De Vito is Conan. She cannot even begin to do anything with this character, if only because hers, and every other character are all so out of place in the nineties. In fact this is one of the biggest mistakes that Benedek and Rayfiel have made in setting this definitive 50's romance in the modern era. Big miscalculation. That is what the whole show turns out to be.Ford and Ormond create zero chemistry, and he looks old enough to be her aging father (at least 30 years older). You just can't believe him, feel sorry for her or buy into any aspect of their relationship. Flick struggles to be funny throughout, and none of the cast is able to rescue, resurrect or otherwise resuscitate this floundering, very lost film. What did Pollack think he was doing? Surely he of all people should have known to leave this doomed remake well alone.Entire cast struggle to communicate character motivation, and little else, including Paris scenery, can help this misplaced, poorly judged dead weight.

The whole world of network television is just put in another light when watching this movie. I was not alive for the heyday of network news, but it had to be so much better than it is today. Watching current news programs it is exactly like watching the Howard Beale show. It was scary and sad, but still managed to be funny. Funny in an uncomfortable way. There are a lot of layers to this movie and I have only watched it once, but I am sure a lot more would be revealed as I watched it again. First of all lets comment on the acting. Top notch and I see how so many Oscars were given out. At first Faye Dunaway's performance seemed too flat, but by the end of the movie one sees why it was acted like it was and it was perfect. The perfect tragic figure that did not change and did not learn a lesson just because it was easier for her to continue her life like she always have even knowing it was wrong and would never give her happiness. Nothing needs to be said about Peter Finch's performance except wow. The next performance that stood out was Ned Beatty and his whole scene was film perfection. As he starts his speech to Beale the shot is perfectly crafted and even being such a small spot on the screen he fills and it and gives a damn memorable speech that almost evokes Emerson (maybe not in tone so much, but it was still there). As he calms down the camera moves in, but he is no less engaging. I like how they managed, perhaps by accident, able to convey the racism of the time and in the media. The fact that the movie started out as a movie about a news network and managed to turn them into terrorists and murders in such a short period of time was amazing. The directing was amazing, but with such a good script and with such quality actors it cannot be hard to make such a masterpiece. Not to belittle with Lumet did because he made the movie from the start feel flat and by the end of the movie made it perfect. the best part of the movie was the writing. Top notch writing and one of the better scripts I have encountered in a while. I am going to seek out more of his movies and see what else this guy is capable of.

The perfect tragic figure that did not change and did not learn a lesson just because it was easier for her to continue her life like she always have even knowing it was wrong and would never give her happiness. Nothing needs to be said about Peter Finch's performance except wow. The next performance that stood out was Ned Beatty and his whole scene was film perfection. As he starts his speech to Beale the shot is perfectly crafted and even being such a small spot on the screen he fills and it and gives a damn memorable speech that almost evokes Emerson (maybe not in tone so much, but it was still there). As he calms down the camera moves in, but he is no less engaging. I like how they managed, perhaps by accident, able to convey the racism of the time and in the media. The fact that the movie started out as a movie about a news network and managed to turn them into terrorists and murders in such a short period of time was amazing. The directing was amazing, but with such a good script and with such quality actors it cannot be hard to make such a masterpiece. Not to belittle with Lumet did because he made the movie from the start feel flat and by the end of the movie made it perfect. the best part of the movie was the writing. Top notch writing and one of the better scripts I have encountered in a while. I am going to seek out more of his movies and see what else this guy is capable of. Overall a brilliant movie and I probably go on about how it was perfect. I am not sure I can think of a bad thing about this movie.

Whoa&#133; it's a big step-down. I couldn't wipe the smirk of my face throughout the whole viewing, but hey it was surely entertaining in its holds-no-barred approach of exploitative violence, outlandish action pieces and obvious political propaganda. Yeah its dumb. After being missing in action for seven years Chuck's American colonel escapes back to America. No one believes Chuck's warnings of remaining MIA American soldiers still being kept in Vietnamese POW camps, well not in the manner he goes about it. So Chuck packs heavy artillery, and lets the government officials do the talking, so he can sneak about and he get living proof. And along the way hand out some of his own personal poetic justice.Director Joseph Zito never lets up on its gritty comic booking styling, but even with this raw, sordid and blistering punch. The story never leaves its conventional framework, but its how immensely overwrought the main context feels and pushy it becomes. You can only take it as junk, especially with a lacking script, which only adds to the messy continuity and never makes too much of the other players in the story. Norris' patriotic character is defined, but the rest of the cast feel like nothing more than forgettable stepping stones for the story to progress along. A lively M. Emmet Walsh is the only one to make much of a dent, and the rapport with Norris always diverts. The bad guys here come across half-baked. James Hong's snake-like part was to small, and Ernie Ortega's character needed more weight. The stunning Lenore Kasdorf gets little to do. Now Norris&#133; other than that mush above his lips. Unbuttoned shirt and denim jeans. A beer in the hand. Trademark qualities are here, which it wouldn't feel right without them. Quite a one-note performance, but just watch him move like a panther and be in awe of his lethal abilities. You can't put this man down.The organic atmosphere prominently sticks out with its details. Rough, edgy photography vividly frames the densely lush riverside scenery, and jungles (Philippines' locations) to the sleazy, dirt-ridden streets of Bangkok. Some moments are filled with dark, shadowy lighting. The music score is the usual generic electronic blare-up. Sound fx comes through loud, and clear. You would like it to, with the constant spray of bullets, explosions and fist-smacking abound. Some action pieces come off nicely, and some not so, but still you get a laugh. Even with its outlandish dashes of explosions, mayhem and Norris. The pace did have a stalling problem leaving some dull passages.As for the sequels to follow, they're even worse (that's got to be telling you something) as they can't match the sheer boldness, and tacky audaciousness of this 80s time capsule.

It is one of those rare cases where thrills are combined with jokes that ultimately create a realistic and authentistic sense for the atmosphere of the picture and proves itself to be a great roller coaster of a ride without ever becoming too scary or too funny to become schlock, boring, or even uninteresting. It plays itself perfectly, lasts exactly as long as it should, has the right amount of jokes (intelligent jokes), great characters, an interesting plot if not original, and is overall a lot of fun.The Mummy stars Brandon Fraser as a young adventurer-gunfighter who has visited the sacred Egyptian city of Hammunaptra, which is guarded by a secret society who believe that a cursed mummy lies beneath the sands and if awakened, would be unstoppable. Fraser returns to Hammunaptra with a naive, but intelligence librarian and her brother, and oppose a rival company of Americans seeking treasure. Sooner or later, as the secret society feared, the mummy is awaken and great danger is set loose in the world.The special effects utilized in The Mummy are utterly convincing. Arnold Vosloo played the mummy in both skin and mummy form and it was up to the special effects team to elaborately convert him into this ugly, contorted, and frightening villain with holes and bugs in him. The mummy mostly roars like a monster, necessarily, and when needed, he talks in a growling, low-pitch voice that makes him scary. And no mortal weapon can kill him, making him a tricky foe to conquer. And of course, he's got his humble servants more mummies. Not invincible like him, but still effectively brought to the screen.The Mummy also features a fair deal of action scenes, most of them gunfights. The body count in the film is considerably high, and I'm talking about people as well as resurrected mummies. Because it's a fun part-comedy adventure ride, it does not take the matter of life and death seriously. So if a civilian ends up having to shoot a man dead, it does not seem to have an ever-lasting effect on them, but it should not. That would slow the pacing down and destroy the overall effect of the movie. And yes, some of the fight scenes were a bit ridiculous. Yes, I noticed Brandon Fraser firing a six-shot revolver more than six times without reloading, but seriously, who cares? How many times has that been done before? Dozens. We glance over them, so we can glance over this.Again, this is exactly the kind of film I enjoy. Even critics who found some not-so-positive things to say about The Mummy admitted that they were never bored with it. And neither was I. It is a quintessential thrill ride full of adventure, laughs, and lots of fun. Overall, it's entertaining.

Ever since I saw it back in 2008, I fell in love on first viewing.Stanley Kubrick is one of Cinema's most legendary directors, so it goes without saying that he has an impressive resume. However, I have never seen a director quite as ambitious or daring as Kubrick here. The opening of 2001 demands attention in the first second, and amazingly the film reaches out and grabs you with it's amazing use of music, cinematography, and images. The film has no dialogue until after the 20- minute mark, yet it always remains completely mesmerizing. The film is a journey, an exploration that only those who are really willing to will experience. The film's atmosphere and mood is what sets it apart. It is true that a film's plot is very important, but I think what comes before that is how a film makes you feel. Of course, what you feel might come from the plot, characters, or writing, but it also comes from the direction, the use of music, and the abstract structure that a film might have. In that aspect, the film has many memorable scenes, scenes that are sure to blow your mind away, despite you never really knowing what they actually mean. That is the definition of a true artistic achievement.I do not want to say more, simply because a film like this is meant to be discussed based on your own personal feelings and theories after your viewing.

Of course, a film like this is also warranted to attract a large number of criticism, maybe on the level of ambition or 'pretension' as many will like to call it.

Evidently there was a police force in charge of crowd control during the making of that movie that was, ah, interestingly diverse to the point that it caught Maslansky's attention and inspired him to approach a sergeant and ask him why there were so many gym class drop-outs on the force. The sergeant replied that they had a fair employment policy in place that compelled them to accept any applicant who took an interest in becoming an officer, but then with a wink he explained that they could flunk out whoever they wanted after three weeks. Instantly, a light bulb popped on above Maslansky's head.Do you see what this means? Police Academy is based on a true story!!In response to public discontent as a result of a crime wave that has been sweeping the city, the Mayor puts in place a new rule forcing the Police Department to accept any new applicant regardless of age, height, weight, sex, background, attitude, religion, nationality, IQ, criminal history, or SAT score, which causes the police academy to be bombarded with societal aberrations the likes of which would surely cause the public more concern than the criminals causing the crime wave in the first place. No nonsense Police Chief Henry Hurst is immediately and thoroughly appalled at the new ruling as he watches the dregs of society flood his beloved police academy, while Commandant Lassard sits in his chair and cheerfully allows the curious developments of life to happen around him as they will. Most of the recruits that become central to the story are honest people who really want to be police officers, except for Casey Mahoney (Steve Guttenburg, in a career-making-and-then-breaking role), who is forced into the academy as an alternative to jail. How could anyone at any time ever be offered the choice of becoming a police officer or going to jail? Watch the movie and you'll find out, but it doesn't really matter. It has to do with Mahoney having a powerful father, but the point is that Mahoney is a smart-ass who has not a scrap of respect for authority and who is determined to get himself booted out of the academy before lunch on the first day. The academy is equally happy to be rid of him, but for circumstances beyond either of their controls, this is not an option. It's a preposterous situation, but you have to admire it's simplicity and effectiveness in paving the way for a whole movie full of slapstick hilarity.The rest of the relevant cast provide the springboard from which six sequels sprouted in subsequent years. Indeed, the plots of the movies run a distant second to who is back for each subsequent movie. Moses Hightower is a towering black man who became tired of being a florist, of all things, and decided to become a cop. His counterpart is Cadet Hooks, a mousy black woman with the voice of a stretched balloon who, among other things, must learn to speak with authority. Larvell Jones comes from a background similar to Mahoney's in a lot of ways but is better known for his ability to imitate the sound of almost anything (this was also a career-making-and-breaking role for Michael Winslow). Then there are Tackleberry, the trigger-happy but hilarious gun fanatic, Karen Thompson, the attractive cadet played by Kim Cattrall who provides a welcome distraction for Mahoney, the overweight and perfectly named Leslie Barbara (a man), and Doug Fackler, a priceless geek who is prone to cause accidents that don't affect himself. And overseeing them all is the delightfully creepy Lieutenant Harris, who is determined that they shall all fail miserably. This should seem like an exceedingly easy task, but as they say, never underestimate the power of stupid people in large numbers!The first movie in the Police Academy saga follows little more than the adventures of the recruits described above as they work their way through the police academy. There is a delightful competition between Lieutenant Harris, who treats his job with deadly seriousness as needed to ensure his own advancement, and the rest of the recruits, with Commandant Lassard popping up occasionally to fulfill the duties of a man clearly more interested in goldfish than law enforcement, but it's impossible not to love the guy.Speaking of which, Lassard is the, umm, victim of one of the movie's more childish and unamusing jokes. I am not sure how successful the joke was when the movie was first released (I was 5 years old at the time and can't remember my initial reaction), but it is an unfortunate representative of much of the rest of the movie. Police Academy is a milestone in the evolution of the cheesy comedy, there are no two ways about that, but the comedy in the movie has, ah, not dated well. Modern audiences will find not a single genuinely funny moment in the entire movie, but it would be madness to say that this means the movie isn't any fun.I remember when I was a kid I used to drive my brother nuts because I always wanted to watch Police Academy movies over and over again, but at some point I lost interest, and didn't gain interest again until about a week ago when I stumbled across the Police Academy DVD collection. But for an amusing trip to the comedy of the past, you can hardly do better. Grab a couple beers, bring your buddies over, and relish the comedy of your childhood. There were never any Academy Awards in mind, but I'm willing to bet that you can't watch this movie without having a little fun&#133; ","genre":null},{"date":"8 March 2008","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" There is a pretty good documentary included with the DVD collection in which it is revealed that producer Paul Maslansky got the idea for the whole premise of Police Academy when he was working on Hot Stuff in the late 1970s.

Evidently there was a police force in charge of crowd control during the making of that movie that was, ah, interestingly diverse to the point that it caught Maslansky's attention and inspired him to approach a sergeant and ask him why there were so many gym class drop-outs on the force. The sergeant replied that they had a fair employment policy in place that compelled them to accept any applicant who took an interest in becoming an officer, but then with a wink he explained that they could flunk out whoever they wanted after three weeks. Instantly, a light bulb popped on above Maslansky's head.Do you see what this means? Police Academy is based on a true story!!In response to public discontent as a result of a crime wave that has been sweeping the city, the Mayor puts in place a new rule forcing the Police Department to accept any new applicant regardless of age, height, weight, sex, background, attitude, religion, nationality, IQ, criminal history, or SAT score, which causes the police academy to be bombarded with societal aberrations the likes of which would surely cause the public more concern than the criminals causing the crime wave in the first place. No nonsense Police Chief Henry Hurst is immediately and thoroughly appalled at the new ruling as he watches the dregs of society flood his beloved police academy, while Commandant Lassard sits in his chair and cheerfully allows the curious developments of life to happen around him as they will. Most of the recruits that become central to the story are honest people who really want to be police officers, except for Casey Mahoney (Steve Guttenburg, in a career-making-and-then-breaking role), who is forced into the academy as an alternative to jail. How could anyone at any time ever be offered the choice of becoming a police officer or going to jail? Watch the movie and you'll find out, but it doesn't really matter. It has to do with Mahoney having a powerful father, but the point is that Mahoney is a smart-ass who has not a scrap of respect for authority and who is determined to get himself booted out of the academy before lunch on the first day. The academy is equally happy to be rid of him, but for circumstances beyond either of their controls, this is not an option. It's a preposterous situation, but you have to admire it's simplicity and effectiveness in paving the way for a whole movie full of slapstick hilarity.The rest of the relevant cast provide the springboard from which six sequels sprouted in subsequent years. Indeed, the plots of the movies run a distant second to who is back for each subsequent movie. Moses Hightower is a towering black man who became tired of being a florist, of all things, and decided to become a cop. His counterpart is Cadet Hooks, a mousy black woman with the voice of a stretched balloon who, among other things, must learn to speak with authority. Larvell Jones comes from a background similar to Mahoney's in a lot of ways but is better known for his ability to imitate the sound of almost anything (this was also a career-making-and-breaking role for Michael Winslow). Then there are Tackleberry, the trigger-happy but hilarious gun fanatic, Karen Thompson, the attractive cadet played by Kim Cattrall who provides a welcome distraction for Mahoney, the overweight and perfectly named Leslie Barbara (a man), and Doug Fackler, a priceless geek who is prone to cause accidents that don't affect himself. And overseeing them all is the delightfully creepy Lieutenant Harris, who is determined that they shall all fail miserably.

With Holiday Inn, make it three old smoothies Crosby, Astaire and Irving Berlin. In fact, the only thing to get in the way of the movie is the plot. It's boy meets girl, boy loses girl to his best friend and partner. Repeat with another girl. Then bring back the first girl. Do another roundelay until boy and second girl and partner and first girl all have a happy ending. What makes the movie work so well and is such a pleasure to watch, or course, is Crosby singing, Astaire dancing, and both doing their charming best with songs, some new, some old, by Irving Berlin. Berlin was one of the great American song writers who hit their peak from the late Twenties through the late Forties. Many of the cognoscenti sniff their noses at him as corny or just too popular. Berlin was, in fact, a highly skilled and immensely talented song writer. He wrote songs which were original, catchy, varied and inevitable...that rare quality in a song that hits a listener with a melody never heard before yet which seems as if each note could never have been placed in any other way. He also was a shrewd businessman. Holiday Inn is one of several movies Berlin personally pitched to Hollywood. The stories were never much, but Berlin would mix hits from his catalog and write new songs. In addition to Holiday Inn, think of There's No Business Like Show Business, Blue Skies, Alexander's Ragtime Band, This Is the Army and White Christmas. The genesis in each case was Berlin. They worked so well because Berlin could write hits in so many styles, lush and romantic, sad and romantic, waltzes, comedy numbers, ballads, syncopated struts, jazzy, patriotic, sentimental or bawdy. It's not for nothing that Cole Porter and Fred Astaire were close friends of his. Personally, I think he could write in more styles and yet keep his own personality intact than any of the great American songwriters except Richard Rodgers. Considering his competition included Gershwin, Porter, Kern and Rodgers, I realize that's quite a statement. If I were stranded on a desert island and could only listen -- over and over -- to the songs of one Broadway composer, Rodgers would be first choice. Berlin would be second. In Holiday Inn, the idea is simple. Jim Hardy (Bing Crosby) leaves the team of Hardy and Hanover (Fred Astaire as Ted Hanover) to lead a lazy, country life on a Connecticut farm, far away from the incessant work of show business. He thinks he's going to marry the third member of the team, Lila Dixon (Virginia Dale). For those keeping score, she's girl number one. But Ted wins Lila, who is good natured up to the point where her ambition takes over, with promises of a bright dancing career. Later, Jim mets Linda Mason (Marjorie Reynolds) and gets the idea of turning his farm into Holiday Inn, a cozy, bucolic supper-club which will open only on holidays. But Lila has left Ted, Ted meets Linda, and...you get the idea. From his catalog, Berlin provided major hits such as Lazy and Easter Parade. Among the lesser known songs or songs written specifically for the movie are You're Easy to Dance With, Be Careful, It's My Heart and a song that got off to a slow start but which turned into one of Berlin's powerhouse hits, White Christmas. For Astaire fans, notable numbers include... --I'll Capture Her Heart Singing - This starts the movie and introduces us to the team of Hardy and Hanover. It's jaunty, funny and perfectly matches, with tongue in cheek, the singing skills of Crosby and the dancing skills of Astaire. --You're Easy to Dance With - Astaire and Virginia Dale do this number as a star supper- club number from their act. It's a smooth, fluid routine, part swing, part tap, that's sophisticated and perfectly executed. --Be Careful, It's My Heart - The number starts out being sung by Crosby, then turns into one of those great, romantic wooing numbers by Astaire with Marjorie Reynolds. The conclusion is a knock out. Astaire and Reynolds sweep around behind a large valentine and, backlit so only their shadows show, pause and hold a classic pose in silhouette, then continue back to the dance floor. They sweep around again behind the valentine, but this time they leap through it toward us, tearing what had seemed a solid backdrop into paper shreds. It's highly dramatic and unexpected. --Say It With Firecrackers - This turned out to be one of Astaire's most complicated dance numbers; it took 38 takes to get it right. He starts out with fast tapping and never lets up...then takes it higher by incorporating firecrackers and exploding torpedoes into the dance, pulling them from his pockets and hurling them on the polished dance floor, matching the explosions in perfect rhythm to his taps. It's quite a sight. Holiday Inn has charm, first-class performances by Crosby and Astaire and memorable songs by Berlin. For those interested in the composer, I recommend As Thousands Cheer The Life of Irving Berlin by Laurence Bergreen and The Complete Lyrics of Irving Berlin by Robert Kimball.

And for those people who don't care for Maxine Bahns, I think she's better than she is given credit for. She has some moments that are just terrific, like when she first pops over the front seat of the cab and introduces herself with the story of her friend under the sink. This was the performance that convinced me that Jennifer Aniston really can act well--the scene where McGlone says he wants a divorce is wonderfully played by her-- that mix of anger and hurt and shock are portrayed beautifully. And John Mahoney is great, as is Cameron Diaz. The structural parallels are also terrific, as they illustrate the differences in the two couples. Shopping in a thrift shop as opposed to an upscale boutique, the contrast in apartments, etc., are all great devices to illustrate and underline the differences between the two brothers and couples. And using McGlone's driver as a kind of chorus worked very well, at least for me. In conclusion, this film is a ton of fun, and conveys meaning beyond what one would expect from a romantic comedy (if I have to categorize it). Is it flawed? Of course. But for me, this is a film that transcends its flaws and works on a number of levels, both literal and figurative. I highly recommend it.

And for those people who don't care for Maxine Bahns, I think she's better than she is given credit for. She has some moments that are just terrific, like when she first pops over the front seat of the cab and introduces herself with the story of her friend under the sink. This was the performance that convinced me that Jennifer Aniston really can act well--the scene where McGlone says he wants a divorce is wonderfully played by her-- that mix of anger and hurt and shock are portrayed beautifully. And John Mahoney is great, as is Cameron Diaz. The structural parallels are also terrific, as they illustrate the differences in the two couples. Shopping in a thrift shop as opposed to an upscale boutique, the contrast in apartments, etc., are all great devices to illustrate and underline the differences between the two brothers and couples. And using McGlone's driver as a kind of chorus worked very well, at least for me. In conclusion, this film is a ton of fun, and conveys meaning beyond what one would expect from a romantic comedy (if I have to categorize it). Is it flawed? Of course. But for me, this is a film that transcends its flaws and works on a number of levels, both literal and figurative. I highly recommend it.

This is a movie where everything came to together, the acting, directing, writing, the music, everything is just amazing. And, unlike The Motion Picture, it feels like classic Star Trek. The story is essentially a sequel to an episode from the original TV show called, Space Seed, which shows the return of Ricardo Montalbon as KHAN and he wants revenge on Captain Kirk, or in this movie, Admiral Kirk for he did to him. Simple plot, easy to understand. But there is a very important sub-plot, involving a former love interest of Kirk and her son, who created a device simply called, Genisis, which will be used to turn a dead planet into a habitable one. One of the best parts of the movie is the space battles between The Enterprise and Khan's stolen Starship the Reliant. There are two really cool battles, which is not only a battle of firepower, but a true cat and mouse, battle of wits. And of course what adds to the battles is the great music, written by James Horner. Now if you never seen this movie and don't know the ending, STOP READING. However, the ending of this movie, much like Darth Vader turning out to be Luke Skywalkers father, might not be as surprising. And I'm sure most you know what happened in the end. But I think I have too many spoilers anywayOverall, this movie is just plain awesome. Of course, this movie is not the end of the story as the ending of this movie will spawn another sequel...

You've got the screen debut of Maureen O'Hara, who's playing a young woman who gets involved with a group of pirates when she travels from Ireland to England to stay with her aunt Patience (Marie Ney) and her abusive husband Joss (Leslie Banks). Very quickly we find out that the local magistrate, Sir Humphrey (Charles Laughton), is the mastermind behind their scheme of tricking ships into wrecking on the shores of Cornwall, murdering the sailors and stealing their cargo. She befriends a young pirate (Robert Newton) who the others want to hang for skimming the take and together they set about trying to prevent another robbery.The story itself is very interesting and takes us to a location and period in English history that we don't hear much about. There's a wonderful seedy quality to the clothing of the pirates and the locations they inhabit. Hitchcock and his writers seem infatuated with the lifestyle of the thugs. The story is from a book by Daphne Du Maurier, who was apparently one of Hitchcock's favorite authors (he also did films of her Rebecca and The Birds, both much more well known than this film). Unfortunately a lot of the story elements are very predictable -- Laughton's behavior from the very beginning is far from the gentleman who O'Hara seems to take him for rather naively even though she's seen him toss a bag of coins to his compatriots after losing a bet on her beauty. I suppose on a certain level the film is a warning about the deception of appearances -- Joss starts to seem like a more sympathetic character than Sir Humphrey, especially when he essentially sacrifices himself for Mary (O'Hara) towards the end. This is fairly standard melodrama -- you have an impossible love between the aunt and the uncle; the conventions of melodrama (not to mention the PCA) will not allow him to escape punishment for his crimes, but his love for his wife is true so the writer allows him to make the sacrifice so that this conflict will resolve itself in a way that satisfies the audience. All through the film there's a hint that Joss might be sexually interested in Mary. Only in the act of sacrifice does he reveal his real nature.But then the film has yet another surprise for us -- Laughton's character becomes more and more irrational until we reach a point by the end where Mary realizes along with the rest of us that he's actually completely insane. This is revealed largely through the relationship between Sir Humphrey and his manservant Chadwick (Horace Hodges), one that has vague homo-erotic connotations (possibly just a fanciful invention of Laughton, though Hitchcock couldn't have failed to have noticed it). Touchingly, Sir Humphrey bids another servant to watch over Chadwick after he leaves because he's worried about the other man's mental health! That's just one of the examples of offbeat humor that Hitchcock employs in this film, often using the humor to offset and relieve the intensity of the suspense. For example when James (Newton) has gathered the troops and is trying to arrest Sir Humphrey, he stops by Sir Humphrey's estate just long enough for one of his foppish hangers-on to comment hey, you're wearing my uniform! I couldn't say I noticed any other typical director's touches, except the pan that reveals Laughton as the collaborator. I'm not a huge expert on Hitchcock in particular though, but I have noticed the humor involved in his suspense scenes, a device he also used in The Lady Vanishes and all the way through North by Northwest. The performances are all solid. I liked what O'Hara was able to do with her eyes after Laughton tied her mouth up; she was clearly naturally talented as a screen actress. Laughton is always tough to assess because he likes to play around so much and have so much fun inhabiting the role that it sometimes damages his performance, and he was a guy with a world of talent.... so much so that it seems like he gets bored with it and does other things, sometimes things that work and sometimes things that don't. I'd say this film is a 7 or 8 out of 10 on the Laughton scale. He's sufficiently creepy in the early scenes and his playfulness works nicely with the madman angle that the writers wanted to take towards the end. Leslie Banks' work in the film was probably the most impressive in my opinion because he also had the broadest character to work with, and managed to make this character work as a human being.Certainly an exceptional British film from the period, giving us a rather unusual story filmed with great skill and played by a group of talented actors.

You've got the screen debut of Maureen O'Hara, who's playing a young woman who gets involved with a group of pirates when she travels from Ireland to England to stay with her aunt Patience (Marie Ney) and her abusive husband Joss (Leslie Banks). Very quickly we find out that the local magistrate, Sir Humphrey (Charles Laughton), is the mastermind behind their scheme of tricking ships into wrecking on the shores of Cornwall, murdering the sailors and stealing their cargo. She befriends a young pirate (Robert Newton) who the others want to hang for skimming the take and together they set about trying to prevent another robbery.The story itself is very interesting and takes us to a location and period in English history that we don't hear much about. There's a wonderful seedy quality to the clothing of the pirates and the locations they inhabit. Hitchcock and his writers seem infatuated with the lifestyle of the thugs. The story is from a book by Daphne Du Maurier, who was apparently one of Hitchcock's favorite authors (he also did films of her Rebecca and The Birds, both much more well known than this film). Unfortunately a lot of the story elements are very predictable -- Laughton's behavior from the very beginning is far from the gentleman who O'Hara seems to take him for rather naively even though she's seen him toss a bag of coins to his compatriots after losing a bet on her beauty. I suppose on a certain level the film is a warning about the deception of appearances -- Joss starts to seem like a more sympathetic character than Sir Humphrey, especially when he essentially sacrifices himself for Mary (O'Hara) towards the end. This is fairly standard melodrama -- you have an impossible love between the aunt and the uncle; the conventions of melodrama (not to mention the PCA) will not allow him to escape punishment for his crimes, but his love for his wife is true so the writer allows him to make the sacrifice so that this conflict will resolve itself in a way that satisfies the audience. All through the film there's a hint that Joss might be sexually interested in Mary. Only in the act of sacrifice does he reveal his real nature.But then the film has yet another surprise for us -- Laughton's character becomes more and more irrational until we reach a point by the end where Mary realizes along with the rest of us that he's actually completely insane. This is revealed largely through the relationship between Sir Humphrey and his manservant Chadwick (Horace Hodges), one that has vague homo-erotic connotations (possibly just a fanciful invention of Laughton, though Hitchcock couldn't have failed to have noticed it). Touchingly, Sir Humphrey bids another servant to watch over Chadwick after he leaves because he's worried about the other man's mental health! That's just one of the examples of offbeat humor that Hitchcock employs in this film, often using the humor to offset and relieve the intensity of the suspense. For example when James (Newton) has gathered the troops and is trying to arrest Sir Humphrey, he stops by Sir Humphrey's estate just long enough for one of his foppish hangers-on to comment hey, you're wearing my uniform! I couldn't say I noticed any other typical director's touches, except the pan that reveals Laughton as the collaborator.

There are many things that are right with the movie. You have of course the entire cast of the original Star Trek TV show from the 60's, ten years after the show was canceled. So it is a treat to see the original cast back on the big screen. A wonderful musical score, written by Jerry Goldsmith, then state of the art special effects, an award winning director Robert Wise, probably the most distinguished director to direct a Star Trek film. However, having all those good elements that would seem to make anything a classic, its a classic case of too many cooks, can spoil the broth. The state of the art effects, while truly spectacular, even by today's standards, seemed to over run the film. Sometimes it felt like they were just put in to see how cool it would all look. With all of the special effects overpowering the movie, it was less about the people on the Enterprise. Many of the actors never got to really do much, Sulu, Chekov, Scotty, Uhuara, even McCoy were all overshadowed and didn't have much to do. While the newer members of the crew, Commander Decker and Lt Ilia got a lot of the screen time. Another problem would be writing and directing. The story of The plot, while a probably a good TV episode,(in fact, the story was to have been a pilot episode for an aborted 70's Star Trek TV show which was dropped in favor of the movie) was dragged out for SO long that it made the movie really dull to watch. And while Robert Wise is a great director, he probably wasn't the best choice to be a Star Trek director.Overral, I wouldn't say it was a bad movie. In places, the movie was awesome and had some truly great Star Trek moments. Like when Kirk sees the beautiful re-fitted Enterprise. But unfortunately the problems that I just stated, really hurt the movie as a whole. But it would get better for the Star Trek movie franchise.....
