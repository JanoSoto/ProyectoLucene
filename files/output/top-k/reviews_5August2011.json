[{"date":"5 August 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Charles Chaplin stars, directs, produces, and writes the score in one of his greatest movies since The Kid(1921). It's the story of an absent-minded, but mild-manner Jewish barber(Charles Chaplin) and a ruthless dictator named Adenoid Hynkel(also Charles Chaplin). What do these two have in common? They look exactly like each other! Talk about a case of mistaken identity. Like all the Jewish people during WWII, the Jewish barber was a victim of discrimination and was forced to live in a ghetto. Watch the comic scenes where the Jewish barber dances to the tune of Brahm's Hungarian Dance No. 5 while working at his barbershop, where Hynkel takes off Field Marshall Herring's(Billy Gilbert, who worked for the Three Stooges and Laurel & Hardy) many badges, and the comical dinner fight with Hynkel and Napaloni(Jack Oakie) and stay tuned for the most powerful speech delivered by the Jewish Barber since MLK's I Have A Dream. The movie is a satire of Germany during WWII and Adenoid Hynkel was based on the infamous dictator of Germany, Adolf Hitler. This movie also stars Paulette Goddard as the beautiful Hannah and Reginald Gardiner as Commander Shultz. The Great Dictator is one movie you'll watch again and again! 10 Million stars out of ten.
