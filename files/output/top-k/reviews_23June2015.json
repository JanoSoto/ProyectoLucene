This film was not James Cameron's directorial debut (that is 1981's Piranha II The Spawning, which I hear is terrible), but it was the film that made Cameron famous, and ever since, he has made great films, such as the 1986 sequel to Alien, Aliens, and the 1991 sequel to this film, Terminator 2 Judgement Day. It also made Arnold Schwarzenegger an action star, from here on. Even after 31 years, The Terminator is not only a classic action film, but it is also one of my favorite, sic-fi action thrillers, in general.The plot of The Terminator first takes place in the year 1984. In the year 2029, there is a war between the machines and humans. The leader of the humans is John Connor. The machines are attempting to destroy the human race. Two beings travel back in time to 1984. One is a cyborg assassin, known as a Terminator T-800 Model 101, programed by an A.I. defense network called Skynet, which will be able to control itself and cause a nuclear holocaust on mankind. The Terminator was programed to kill a young woman named Sarah Connor, John's future mother, before John was born so that the machines could win and destroy the human race. What Skynet did not know, however, is that John Connor has sent a human resistance fighter named Kyle Reese to protect Sarah from the Terminator.The film is Arnold Schwarzenegger's breakout performance an usually, his performances in action films tend to be entertaining, due to how unintentionally funny his acting is. That is not the case here, because Schwarzenegger is playing a cyborg and he is phoneminal in the role. He captures a cold, dark, and terrifying performance as the iconic Terminator. Michael Biehn is also great as the cold Kyle Reese, who is determined to protect the future. He also share great chemistry with Linda Hamilton, who is also fantastic as Sarah Connor. Sarah starts out as a weak and scared woman, but eventually develops into a much stronger female character, which would lead her to becoming the badass that we know in Terminator 2.The direction from James Cameron is brilliant as the way that the uses his shots and how he edits them are brilliant, which leads to the film having a lot of suspense and tension, especially in the incredible action sequences. The practical special effects might come off as a little dated, at times, but most of them still hold up and are much better than the fake CGI that we get nowadays.The screenplay is also great. First off, although this movie is a sci-fi action film, it definitely has a horror film feel to it, as the Terminator comes off as a very menacing and terrifying villain, similar to a villain in slasher horror films. The movie also not only uses its original (for its time) premise to its full potential, but the world building for its universe is also great. The characters are also well developed, which makes you root for them, and the film also provides a great commentary about how we can be so dependent on machines.Overall, The Terminator is a great start to a franchise and would spawn three sequels, along with a reboot (which, as I'm writing this review, hasn't come out yet), and, like other film franchises, would spawn a spin off TV series and comic books. It's very original for its time, highly entertaining, suspenseful, and provides great world building, interesting characters, strong performances, and incredible action sequences. This is definitely one of the best action films of the 1980s.I'm going to give The Terminator an A+ (10\/10).

Robocop is also rife with swipes at capitalism and corporate greed (you can well imagine large corporations wasting huge amounts of money on a failed project and continually refusing to believe that said failed project is a waste of time). This kind of acts as a running theme in the background.I think what really sets Robocop apart from many science fiction\/action films is that it has a heart and is also intelligent. In the wrong hands this could have been just a mindless shoot em up (which would have been fine, but it wouldn't have made it particularly memorable). It's also a film that has a lot of heart; Murphy is a likable family man, a nice guy and therefore I found the scenes when he's starting to reform his memories to be particularly moving. These flashbacks and memories help to flesh out Murphy's character and ultimately give us enough of a vested interest to care about his character and the story in general.Are there any problems with this film? Yes only a couple of minor ones though; the ED209 robot effects are clunky and fairly laughable now, but we have to remember that this was made back in 1987 and SFX move on very quickly. I also found it hard to understand why Dick Jones would put a directive 4 in place to stop Robocop arresting him, but didn't put one in to stop Robocop arresting Boddicker or any of his cronies? I mean that is effectively what brought Jones' entire operation down?Having said that these are minor niggles more than anything and despite these minor problems Robocop is still an excellent film. It's violent, it's bloody, but it's also intelligent and strangely for a sci-fi\/action film it actually has a bit of heart as well. A wonderful film that has clearly stood the test of time and one that still holds up well following repeat viewings.

Also arriving from the same future into the present world is Kyle Reese; a soldier whose only mission is to protect Sarah Connor from the Terminator at all costs.Written & directed by James Cameron, The Terminator marks a remarkable breakthrough for the then-new filmmaker into the Hollywood industry & wonderfully showcases his excellent understanding of what constitutes a great cinema. It's astonishing how amazingly well this film has aged over the years despite its low budget plus what Cameron manages to put up on the screen on that allowance only speaks volumes about his sweeping cinematic vision, creative ability & precision eye for detail.Coming to the technical aspects, I've got nothing but praise for this film. The special effects team does a terrific job in bringing to life what is a frightening portrait of a post-apocalyptic future & it looks incredibly convincing on the screen. A few effects do appear slightly dated but it doesn't affect the whole experience by any means. Cinematography makes smart use of camera in sustaining the film's tense ambiance from start to finish while Editing unfolds the story at a brisk pace & is at its best during the action sequences.As far as acting department is concerned, The Terminator features an interesting ensemble in Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton & Michael Biehn, and all 3 of them have done an outstanding job in their given roles. Biehn balances himself well as Kyle Reese, Hamilton's character arc is most rewarding for we see her going from a vulnerable victim to accepting her fate & fighting for her survival, but the real star of the film is of course Schwarzenegger in the role of Terminator; who is now ranked amongst cinema's most iconic characters.Requiring minimum amount of dialogues & a physical built that's imposing n intimidating at the same time, the role of the Terminator was tailor-made for Schwarzenegger's talents and he absolutely nailed it with his mute expressions, automated dialogue delivery & machine- like movements to give life to an antagonist that's simply invincible. Last but not the least, the background score by Brad Fiedel is an underrated gem in itself whose main theme has easily become one of the most recognizable tracks in existence today plus it compliments the whole narrative in a fascinating manner.On an overall scale, The Terminator is one of the best films of the 1980s that has exquisitely endured the test of time, is a landmark achievement of its genre that continues to inspire & influence films even today, and is one of the proudest works in the career of both Cameron & Schwarzenegger. Unforgettable for its contribution to pop culture, immortal for its lasting influence on science-fiction & action filmmaking, and significant for enriching the film world with a master storyteller who would go on to script an unparalleled legacy of his own in his later films, The Terminator is an undeniable classic in every sense of the word.

I only ever wanted to watch it after refreshing myself with the first two parts, but that's a long investment. You've seen over 6 hours worth of film before you get around to the third, usually I'm burnt out by then. However, this time I really came around on Part II. While I'm still hot and cold on Part I, mostly admiring it more than enjoying it, I found a deep and consistent appreciation of Part II that really spoke to me on a personal level. I'd finally found motivation for Part III and I don't intend to revisit it anytime soon. It's good, not great - but you can't take away the things it does right. Most of the acting is stellar, the production is top notch as always and it closes arcs on poignant notes. It's at its best when it's low key. The weakest moments are when Coppola tries too hard. The violence is sudden, but unmeasured. It feels like he's just nudging you for your attention but moments like these fatally break the flow. I hate to agree with the consensus of hating Sofia Coppola, but yes, she is a dire sore thumb in need of a bandage. A surprisingly welcome addition to the saga is Andy Garcia, who's the one exception to the rule of the film's best moments being the low-key ones. It really needed Tom Hagen, his absence illustrates how this was just a film made for the money but the studio wasn't keen to spread that love. Part III is a mixed bag with some worthy highlights.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 June 2015","score":"","review":" With its present reputation, it takes a long time to get around to The Godfather Part III, unless of course you're already a big fan of Coppola's saga.

I only ever wanted to watch it after refreshing myself with the first two parts, but that's a long investment. You've seen over 6 hours worth of film before you get around to the third, usually I'm burnt out by then. However, this time I really came around on Part II. While I'm still hot and cold on Part I, mostly admiring it more than enjoying it, I found a deep and consistent appreciation of Part II that really spoke to me on a personal level. I'd finally found motivation for Part III and I don't intend to revisit it anytime soon. It's good, not great - but you can't take away the things it does right. Most of the acting is stellar, the production is top notch as always and it closes arcs on poignant notes. It's at its best when it's low key. The weakest moments are when Coppola tries too hard. The violence is sudden, but unmeasured. It feels like he's just nudging you for your attention but moments like these fatally break the flow.

Not the teenagers of the Porky franchise or the airheads of Clueless necessarily, but the mature, emotionally headstrong old souls of The Breakfast Club and Flirting. Some grown-up teenagers are more jaded, considerate, and successful than others, while the remaining irresponsible hooligans look like adults but, in a Shallow Hal-ish twist, are actually fifteen- year-olds still in search of an identity. Look at those middle-aged men and women with graying hair taking your order at Wendy's are they not a regretful little girl or boy who doesn't quite realize they're trapped in an adult's body?Sully (Paul Newman) belongs in the camp of the charismatic loners who never took the time to accept their responsibilities and actually grow up. He has freelanced in the construction industry his entire life, most recently making the most of his aging body by suing Carl Roebuck (Bruce Willis), the local contractor, to get extra pocket change. Years ago, Sully left his family at an important time, leaving his now grown son (Dylan Walsh) emotionally stunted, his ex-wife understandably jilted &#x97; why he did it is hard to explain. Commitment was never very attractive to him, and having a family hardly supplemented his lone wolf instincts. Part of his psyche is tarnished by guilt, but the other side reminds him, time and time again, that being a father, a husband, was never for him anyway.Currently, Sully rooms with his former eighth grade teacher, the elderly Beryl Peoples (Jessica Tandy), and passes the time doing dirty work around town and flirting with Carl's long suffering wife (Melanie Griffith). This has been his routine for years, decades even. So when his son comes to town, his wife and kids in tow, Sully is forced, after years of ignoring his most personal problems, to decide whether or not he wants to make up for lost time and finally become the father his son deserved, or ignore the facts and continue living in his own form of sheltered reality.Paul Newman, even when playing the bad guy (a rare case), has never done anything besides be likable. In Cool Hand Luke, he was a should-have-been tarnished anti-hero; in The Verdict, he was an alcoholic grouch who felt it necessary to punch Charlotte Rampling right in the kisser after she betrayed him. Fact is, even when portraying a man at his lowest point, Newman has always been the guy you want to be friends with, the guy who wish was your father, your uncle, your grandfather. There is something starkly humble, and believably all-around good, about him, on screen or off.In Nobody's Fool, he plays a hustler we should, in our good senses, despise. Every character trait that shapes Sully is negative; what good has he done in his life besides make friends with barflies and keep his former teacher company? But damn it all to hell it's impossible not to root for anyone portrayed by Newman. The film finds him nearing seventy, on the last legs of his long career. But hardly aged is his ability to give a face for the everyman, and, yes, the man-children who weren't fantastic youths but, hesitant or not, want to make up for it. Does Nobody's Fool provide for one of Newman's greatest performances? It's hard to say he doesn't have to stretch his abilities like he has had to in the past. What he does do, though, is remind us why he is the movie star Hollywood, I'm sorry to say, can hardly muster today.Robert Benton, whose The Late Show has recently become a favorite of mine, writes and directs. A filmmaker who seems to specialize in the complexities of human relationships (Kramer vs. Kramer, Places of the Heart), Nobody's Fool is masterful in its characterizations near instantly, each character feels completely drawn, as if we have known them for years, as if we have heard all the town gossip that surrounds them. The knotty relationship between Sully and Toby Roebuck (Griffith) especially rings true &#x97; both are so fiercely independent that their flirting with one another comes less from a romantic place and more out of a desperate one. So unhappy are they that a mutual affection comforts their lonely ills. Romance, though? It requires too much commitment and dedication, and both have been too scorned by the past to do anything about their already shaky feelings.The characters of Nobody's Fool are almost abominably flawed, but we find their scarred personas more soothing than bothersome. We feel like we know these people, as if we also live in North Bath and have nothing better to do besides confide in our neighbor. Benton and his actors bring a world of lonely hearts startlingly to life; as messed up as they are, we want to be lonely with them.

This specific plot has been used in countless comedies and for countless genres. It is by far from the greatest movie made but the one that comes to mind that was quite popular during the 1980s was Hal Needham's The Cannonball Run (1981); a ragtag group of zany car drivers set out on the biggest race of their lives to reach the finish line. A few years later, this movie would be released and its plot isn't a stranger to what was previously mentioned; an ordinary group of schmoes from the city join the police academy after it becomes legal for anyone to join for any reason. If they pass, they are officially apart of the police force. Simple as that, and as bare bones as it is, the movie gets by just fine for the most part. The only difference between the two movies is that one is in an actual race of who will win, while the other is a race of who will graduate.Written by Neal Isreal, Pat Proft and Hugh Wilson (who also directed) have put together a decent script with a number of positives and only a couple of negatives that clearly needed to be changed. The biggest issue with its script is that it's not a whole story. Since there are numerous characters, there are just several subthreads that run parallel to each other. This also means some characters will have better developed backstories than others. This is usually the sacrifices that are made for bigger ensemble casts. Unfortunately with that come a number of clichés that have been seen in other comedies. Some of which most filmgoers would expect because of how predictable the typecasting is. Yet, this is forgivable because all the main actors who have the majority of screen time are all likable in their roles. This is due to their distinguished personalities. The big three characters belong to Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg), a labeled troublemaker but only for the wrong reasons, Karen Thompson (Kim Cattrall) as Mahoney's love interest, and Capt. Harris (G.W. Bailey) who strongly loathes Mahoney and wants to remove any other rejects. Bailey continues to be funny in his roles. Every character that he has been cast for remains comical in their own way with his clumsy facial expressions. Then there's gentle giant Moses Hightower (Bubba Smith), the shy Laverne Hooks (Marion Ramsey), sound effects master Larvell Jones (Michael Winslow), the innocent dough boy Leslie Barbara (Donovan Scott), the tough and attractive Capt. Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook), the old forgetful Commander Lassard (George Gaynes), hispanic man George Martin (Andrew Rubin), the gun-totting crazy man Eugene Tackleberry (David Graf) and a couple others. With all of these personalities on screen it is hard not to find at least one thing to exploit from each character when it comes to comedy. For the majority of the time the comedy works efficiently. It's not falling off your seat hilarious but there are several moments that will create some good laughs. A lot of the gags and slapstick are stupid and goofy but they work because of how ridiculously quick the situations get. However, there are some jokes that are a bit crude. Humping and butt jokes are bit immature even if the tone is to be goofy. For its time, yeah maybe it was funny but now, those kinds of gags are just ehh. One of the bigger surprises is when there's a racial slur thrown out in the spotlight. Umm,...OK, since when did one of these antagonists become filled with that much hate?

The framing device of the movie being made is OK. It annoyed me back in the day, but I can see its effectiveness now. It is a way to make commentary on the Victorian times (and their hypocrisy), plus I suppose that it substitutes for that additional cycle of hurt. Great settings and photography of 1860's England. Excellent acting all around, and a good script, once you get past the modern-day scenes. Highly recommended.

It's easy to see why this failed massively. The biggest issue by far is the fact that there is an overload of camp which doesn't fit in at a time when fans wanted a more serious take on the character and it isn't helped by the writing being a total mess either. As a matter of fact the problems with the film are pretty much endless with boring heroes, over-the-top villains, ridiculous action sequences, overbearing visuals and an extremely bland plot. It's maddening how a series with such promise could end with such a disaster.Story Batman and Robin have to contend with Mr. Freeze, who must remain in sub-zero temperatures at all times, as he plans on freezing Gotham City because of his wife's rare illness. Meanwhile Poison Ivy, along with her henchman Bane, appears in Gotham and is intent on driving Batman and Robin apart. Alfred's niece Barbara also arrives from England and the tension rises after Alfred becomes seriously ill. Once more the writers don't learn from past issues and there is again far too much going on to have a coherent story. The freezing Gotham plot is as obvious as it comes, the rift between the two heroes doesn't feel natural and Alfred's illness is clearly shoehorned in for more conflict. There are too many character threads, three new villains and another hero are introduced as well as developing the existing characters is too much to give each the time needed.Batman\/Bruce Wayne Of all the actors who could play the dark knight George Clooney would be near the bottom of the list. Apart from being somewhat suave and having a good chin there is nothing in his favour. When he's Bruce he's just George Clooney and when he's Batman he's George Clooney with a mask on. There is no threat, mystery or tragedy about his Batman, whilst his Bruce Wayne is far too smiley and playful. I just think Clooney is far too laid-back to truly convince in such a role.Villains Arnold Schwarzenegger is truly horrid as Mr. Freeze and whoever cast him is nuts. Freeze is supposed to be cold and tragic with a burning anger toward everyone. But here all he does is crackle like a maniac and spew numerous ice-related one liners. Arnie is dodgy at the best of times so he fails immensely as Freeze, hell he should have been Bane. Uma Thurman is usually good and looks fantastic, but she is hamming it up to stupid levels and it doesn't work. Ivy should be a larger than life villain, but she is given terrible dialogue and randomly gets attached to the main story. 'Bane' here is just a big dumb thug who can only growl and there is no reason for him to be in this.Support Chris O'Donnell is massively let down by the poor script, which results in Robin doing nothing but moan. Why would he can so much about being second best? It is incredibly forced and never comes across like a real conflict. Alicia Silverstone is bland as Barbara. She isn't helped by the script, but she's very wooden in the important scenes and not remotely believable as Batgirl. Michael Gough is the best thing in this as Alfred and delivers the most interesting scenes, whilst Pat Hingle's Gordon is reduced to a bumbling buffoon and adds absolutely nothing to proceedings.Action The action scenes call back to the 60's TV show, but I think even that had more credibility with its fights. All the fight scenes just have Batman and Robin fighting off Freeze's goons or scuffling with Bane in a comedic manner which gets boring very quickly. One of the main fights involves ice hockey with a diamond, just reading that you know it's going to be stupid.Music Elliott Goldenthal returns and his score isn't that different from Forever. In a sense that's okay because that score was pretty good, but it also stinks of laziness. The new tracks he brings in aren't very memorable either.Production Visually the film follows Forever, but goes overboard with its colour scheme. Almost everything is fluorescent, there are giant naked statues littered about and there are gangs whose gimmick is being very brightly coloured. It looks impressive yet it doesn't fit the world Batman exists in. Plus I fail to see how he can lurk in the shadows in a city so bright. The costumes don't look great. The Batsuit is a bit too grey, Robin's suit is just a rip-off of the Nightwing design, the villain costumes look way too over-the-top and least we forget the nipples. The script and the dialogue are truly awful. All Mr. Freeze says is ice one liners, Poison Ivy just keeps referencing 'mother nature', Batgirl is just a dumb schoolgirl and any conflict between Bruce and Dick is extremely corny. The less said about the bat credit card the better.Conclusion So there is effectively nothing good about this film and it doesn't even have value as being so bad that it's good. It is easy to see why is was such a disaster and left the series in the dumps for so long. Schumacher's direction is all over the place, Clooney is terribly dull, the villains are poorly done in every aspect, the visuals are overpowering and the dialogue is dreadful. It seems like every piece of the film from the casting to the writing was done in completely the wrong way. It all leaves a bad taste in the mouth and I find it very difficult to enjoy any area of the film. It's a shame Superman does work alone.

The historical setting is Edwardian England, a time often looked back on in Britain as a golden age of prosperity and peace, despite the pronounced class divisions in British society at the time. Very soon the Edwardian age would be shattered forever by the First World War, and maybe the film portrays the 'impossible' sinking of the Titanic, and the effects on its passengers and crew, as a dark foreshadowing of that terrible war. We follow the preparation of 2nd Officer Charles Lightoller, played by Kenneth More, for the voyage and journey to the port. An aristocratic couple in their elegant horse and carriage are waved off by children of the local workhouse; in rural Ireland, a group of men of more modest means set off in their horse and cart to board at Belfast, destined for ship's quarters far removed from the opulence of first class.There is a huge cast of mostly British character actors. Many of them had recently come through the events of the Second World War, many serving in the armed forces, and were no stranger to hardship; the strain is etched on the faces. This lends the acting great conviction. Kenneth More, who served in the Royal Navy, is superb as the epitome of the unflappable British officer, but there are good performances throughout the cast.The realism is reinforced by the scenes of the ship's interior, and the sinking itself is well portrayed for the special effects standards of the time.

Almost a retelling of the Pinocchio fairy tale, the film is set in the future, after all coastal cities are destroyed by global warming, and strict limits are put on the human populace's ability to reproduce. A family who seemingly has lost their son to coma becomes the perfect test family for a cybernetic child who has been programmed with the ability to love and feel. When the couple's real child recovers, he becomes competitive with the robot for his mother's affections. He makes the robot seem hostile, and the couple decides to return the robot. However, a return means the robot's destruction, which the mother can't bear, so she sets him free in the woods. The child now goes on a lifelong search for the mother, as well as the Blue Fairy from Pinocchio to make him a real boy so she could love him. Excellent effects and cinematography highlight the film, whose only drawback might be its length. Kubrick's fingerprints are all over this movie, as Spielberg shot it in a style that his friend might have had he lived. The ending can be a tearjerker to some, and it's a great story which has gone overlooked in Spielberg's legacy.

Jackson stars in the title role of Shaft. More of a sequel to the successful earlier series that starred Richard Roundtree than a reboot, it follows the exploits of John Shaft, the nephew of the original detective John Shaft, who is once again portrayed by Roundtree. Shaft is a New York City cop who arrests a racist rich heir (Christian Bale) who beats a black restaurant patron to death for no reason. The heir gets bail and skips town, but returns to years later. Shaft makes it his business to hunt him down. He also is hunting down the sole witness to the murder, who doesn't want to be found. When he finally catches the heir, he is once again given bail, which causes Shaft to quit the force and take measures into his own hands. The heir enlists the aid of a local Hispanic drug lord to hunt down the witness to silence her. This film is VERY relevant to today's ills of society, and the tension between the races that exists today. It also is a throwback to the old series, with MUCH better acting, as Jackson and Bale both command the screen. Good turns by Vanessa Williams as Shaft's partner and Toni Colette as the witness, and a great, over-the-top performance by Jeffrey Wright as the drug lord makes the movie much superior to its predecessors. Great flick for action movie fans. ","genre":null},{"date":"23 June 2015","score":"","review":" An homage to the blaxploitation films of the late '60s, early '70s, Samuel L.

U-571 pretty much rips up the history books for its own ends, something that would see even the film makers themselves bow their heads during the years that followed. However... As a drama - cum - thriller, Jonathan Mostow's film is top end. There's some iffy acting in the support slots, but the production is still excellently put together. Suspense down below in the submarine is high anxiety, the tactics of war in the Atlantic superbly written, while the finale face off is edge of the seat gripping. It's these things that has let U-571 gain decent ratings on the main internet movie sites. Taken as a piece of Hollywood guff, it's a rocking war movie, one that also sounds absolutely tremendous through home cinema systems. As long as you accept it as guff - regardless of your nationality, then there is a great time to be had. But just as with films like Braveheart, do familiarise yourselves with the facts afterwards. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 June 2015","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Once in a while there comes a time when a film lover has their patience snapped, that we can't surely accept in this instance that poetic license is OK as an excuse purely for Hollywood to make a piece of entertainment.
