Such is the case of ONE TRUE THING.  I lost both my mother and sister to cancer and had the agonizing experience of watching them both deteriorate before the end came. Meryl Streep gives the greatest performance of her life as Kate Gulden, whose life has been totally dedicated to giving herself sacrificially to her family.  Now, as this debilitating illness overtakes her, she can't accept the fact her family now has to take care of her.  Yet, it is only in this transfer of power that her family comes to know and appreciate just how strong she really is. How Ms. Streep was overlooked by the Academy is beyond me.  Perhaps it is, as another has said, we just take her great talent for granted.  To watch her character change through the progression of her illness and the resulting chemotherapy was astounding to watch.  She is truly one of the greatest actresses ever to grace the screen. Renee Zellweger is convincing as the daughter who is forced to come back home to care for her dying mother, who she has never been close to.  It is a traumatic experience to, once you have worked so hard to earn your independence, have to return home to live with your parents again.  Even Ellen Gulden is not aware of the family values that have been instilled in her by her mother but, although naturally rebellious at the thought, she is willing to give up her promising career as a writer for a New York magazine to take on this responsibility because It's the right thing to do.  This character trait is revealed again later in Ellen's pursuit of a hot story that could make her career--the expose of a Senator and former classmate at Harvard whose political career is in jeopardy because of a variety of indiscretions.  Ellen gets the interview, but lacks the killer instinct to pull it off, knowing her article would ruin not only his career but his family as well. Renee turns in a really sensitive performance.  Her comedic genius comes through as well in the scene where she attempts to make a luncheon for her mother's ladies' club meeting and nearly sets the kitchen on fire.  For some reason, the women barely touch their lunch, but they are still so impressed by her efforts, they make her an honorary Minnie.  It is then Ellen's greatest fears are realized; she is starting to feel trapped in the very world she tried so hard to escape. William Hurt is the father and husband, George Gulden, literary professor at the local university, winner of the American Book Award.  He is an intellectual giant whose acquaintances include some of the great authors of the day.  He does not understand his wife's housekeeping and ladies' club lifestyle, but finds it a convenience to him and a complement to his own career.  In literary circles, George is a master of words, but in communicating to his family, he suffers inflammation of the sentence structure and hardening of the paragraph.  George was Ellen's idol when she was growing up, but now, as an adult, she sees his vulnerabilities and cannot accept them.  Ellen's entire work ethic was motivated by her dad, now he has become, in her eyes, weak and helpless in a time of crisis. ONE TRUE THING is a story of how a family, so diverse yet so much alike, can be drawn together by tragedy.  In the end, they all learn to accept each other as they really are--flaws and all.  The film and the characters all come across as very real and, yes I cried even though I'm a guy.  Anna Quindlen's story is very moving and thought-provoking. The music in the film really helps to set the mood, the score by Cliff Eidelman, and a very beautiful rendition of Silent Night by the Morrow Memorial United Methodist Church Choir of Maplewood, New Jersey (the film was shot in and around areas of New Jersey, not in Langhorne, Pennsylvania). There is also a terrific song by Bette Midler, One True Friend, sung over the ending credits.  Some of those who leave a movie as soon as the last scene fades and don't stay for the credits don't know what they miss. Unfortunately, neither of these two songs are on the soundtrack CD.  It could have been the greatest soundtrack of all time and they blew it. Bette's song is on her CD Bathhouse Betty for all you Midler fans who might be wondering.

I've seen some artsy movies too.  Not to mention the thousands of movies I've seen which portray the ancient idea of `Style Over Substance'.  But The Cell has to be one of the most poorly thought out movies I have ever seen.First off, this movie has a fresh idea.  The idea behind this movie is `what does the mind of a serial killer look like.  The movie takes this idea to another level by adding in a little science fiction a machine that can take people INTO other people's heads.  These are fine ideas.  In fact, they're pretty good.  But this is a perfect example of a good `idea' gone horribly wrong.Now, anyone out there reading this who happens to be a writer, I have a few words for you.  Don't see this movie.  You will be offended.  I am a writer.  I haven't written much, but I do understand writing, especially in film.  Let me tell you this this movie goes against everything I know and have learned as a writer.  If you're a fan of Quentin Tarantino, David Mamet, or Chris McQuarrie, just stop reading this and go to another movie.  The worst problem with this movie, in my opinion, is the poor characters.  The Vince Vaughn character is so underdeveloped that I felt nothing for him.  In fact, I stopped caring about every character after the first act.  It has nothing to do with `Style Over Substance', I just stopped caring, and that is a very bad thing, especially for a writer.  To who ever wrote this movie a good idea can get you so far, but it's your characters that keep the audience interested. Next, the visuals.  Many people praise this movie for it's artistic visuals.  Well, I didn't think that they were that big of a deal.  I can tell it took a lot of time and money to make them, but they really don't look that well.  I also found that every visual, the good looking ones anyway, were all given away in the trailer.  If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the best parts of this movie.Whew, now on to the sickness.  I love serial killer movies.  Se7en and Silence of the Lambs are two of my favorite movies of all time, not to mention I study criminal psychology.  I've never met a serial killer, but I know their behavior.  This serial killer is, well, pretty accurate.  They do use the stereotype of having the serial killer coming from a abusive family.  Most serial killers are well-educated members of society.  You never know.  People just snap sometimes.  But that's not my problem.  My problem is the overuse of disgusting images.  I know that these images are needed to show how screwed up Carl is.  But I think they over do it, just a bit.Direction this is flat out bad.  This man should be shot.  Ask yourself what is the director's job?  It's to handle the actors.  Now a days, he handles all creative aspects of the film, but his primary job is to coach the actors.  Is that done here?  No.  The director has done a good job coaching the scenery, not the actors.  These guys are good actors, yet they give shabby performances (though Vincent D' Onofrio is great being a creepy nut job, as always).  This is not their fault.  This is the fault of a director who doesn't care about characters, and therefore, doesn't care about the actors.  Now, finally, we have the logic holes.  Holy Lord.  I won't even get into it.  Like I've said before, I can look over logic holes as long as they aren't unbelievably obvious.  Well, they're obvious in this movie.  I won't go into to them because you'll see them when they come.Conclusion This is a bad movie.  Anyone calling it genius (cough, cough, ROGER EBERT, cough) does not know what they are talking about.  People like Mr. Ebert only care about `pretty pictures', not about the heart of the movies.  How else could he give The Cell a perfect 4 out of 4, and only give a great film like Gladiator, a 2.  The Usual Suspects? 1 and a half.  Fight Club? 1 and a half (though I guess I can understand that).  See a pattern? I hope so.  Ebert hates good writing, but he does love anything that just looks good like Titan A. E. which he gave 3 and a half out of four.  This movie uses Mr. Ebert to try and get you good people to see this movie, mainly because he's the only major critic who loved it.  I just want you good people to see that Mr. Ebert has no clue what he is talking about.  This IS a bad movie.  It is not art.  It is not even disturbing.  This is weirdness at its lowest level.  This is no movie.  This is one BAD movie. I didn't hate it.  I just think it's bad.  Now some of you `artists' may disagree with me.  Well, movie is a very complicated art form.  To be truly a work of art, a movie needs more than to look pretty.  A painting is a work of art because of how it looks and what it means.  A book is a work of art because of what it stands for, how it reads, and how smart it is.  A movie is a combination of both a painting and a book, to put a visual picture on good characters and a good plot.  Go to my THE HAUNTING review and read my M&M analogy, and you'll understand better.  This movie is all coating.  If you don't like disgusting images, weird plots, and flat-out bad characters, please do yourself a favor and see something else...

You will be offended.  I am a writer.  I haven't written much, but I do understand writing, especially in film.  Let me tell you this this movie goes against everything I know and have learned as a writer.  If you're a fan of Quentin Tarantino, David Mamet, or Chris McQuarrie, just stop reading this and go to another movie.  The worst problem with this movie, in my opinion, is the poor characters.  The Vince Vaughn character is so underdeveloped that I felt nothing for him.  In fact, I stopped caring about every character after the first act.  It has nothing to do with `Style Over Substance', I just stopped caring, and that is a very bad thing, especially for a writer.  To who ever wrote this movie a good idea can get you so far, but it's your characters that keep the audience interested. Next, the visuals.  Many people praise this movie for it's artistic visuals.  Well, I didn't think that they were that big of a deal.  I can tell it took a lot of time and money to make them, but they really don't look that well.  I also found that every visual, the good looking ones anyway, were all given away in the trailer.  If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the best parts of this movie.Whew, now on to the sickness.  I love serial killer movies.  Se7en and Silence of the Lambs are two of my favorite movies of all time, not to mention I study criminal psychology.  I've never met a serial killer, but I know their behavior.  This serial killer is, well, pretty accurate.  They do use the stereotype of having the serial killer coming from a abusive family.  Most serial killers are well-educated members of society.  You never know.  People just snap sometimes.  But that's not my problem.  My problem is the overuse of disgusting images.  I know that these images are needed to show how screwed up Carl is.  But I think they over do it, just a bit.Direction this is flat out bad.  This man should be shot.  Ask yourself what is the director's job?  It's to handle the actors.  Now a days, he handles all creative aspects of the film, but his primary job is to coach the actors.  Is that done here?  No.  The director has done a good job coaching the scenery, not the actors.  These guys are good actors, yet they give shabby performances (though Vincent D' Onofrio is great being a creepy nut job, as always).  This is not their fault.  This is the fault of a director who doesn't care about characters, and therefore, doesn't care about the actors.  Now, finally, we have the logic holes.  Holy Lord.  I won't even get into it.  Like I've said before, I can look over logic holes as long as they aren't unbelievably obvious.  Well, they're obvious in this movie.  I won't go into to them because you'll see them when they come.Conclusion This is a bad movie.  Anyone calling it genius (cough, cough, ROGER EBERT, cough) does not know what they are talking about.  People like Mr. Ebert only care about `pretty pictures', not about the heart of the movies.  How else could he give The Cell a perfect 4 out of 4, and only give a great film like Gladiator, a 2.  The Usual Suspects? 1 and a half.  Fight Club? 1 and a half (though I guess I can understand that).  See a pattern? I hope so.  Ebert hates good writing, but he does love anything that just looks good like Titan A. E. which he gave 3 and a half out of four.  This movie uses Mr. Ebert to try and get you good people to see this movie, mainly because he's the only major critic who loved it.  I just want you good people to see that Mr. Ebert has no clue what he is talking about.  This IS a bad movie.  It is not art.  It is not even disturbing.  This is weirdness at its lowest level.  This is no movie.  This is one BAD movie. I didn't hate it.  I just think it's bad.  Now some of you `artists' may disagree with me.  Well, movie is a very complicated art form.  To be truly a work of art, a movie needs more than to look pretty.  A painting is a work of art because of how it looks and what it means.  A book is a work of art because of what it stands for, how it reads, and how smart it is.  A movie is a combination of both a painting and a book, to put a visual picture on good characters and a good plot.  Go to my THE HAUNTING review and read my M&M analogy, and you'll understand better.  This movie is all coating.  If you don't like disgusting images, weird plots, and flat-out bad characters, please do yourself a favor and see something else...  Please.   3\/10  ","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"24 December 2000","score":"","review":"  This is the standard by which all other movies must be rated.

This is a film that bounces through a nonlinear storyline and any number of genres and yet all the while is basically a showpiece for a single actor. Keith Gordon does what he can with the material, but despite a very strong ending I feel like he's overwhelmed slightly more often that he succeeds.The film takes place in at least four separate time periods, two in the early seventies and two in the early eighties. The earlier periods are essentially the story of the romance between Fielding Pierce (Billy Crudup) and Sarah Williams (Jennifer Connelly), young people of similar leftist ideology, but very different views of how to achieve political goals. Pierce, the son of a blue collar family, wants to take his Harvard diploma and law degree and turn himself into a Senator or a president. He joins the coast guard because he knows that taking a stand outside of the system will cost him his political life someday. She, on the other hand, is disgusted by the corruption of politics and works through the church and grass roots causes. And in 1974, as we're told through a television broadcast in the opening scene, Sarah was killed in a car bombing. Cut to 1983, where Pierce is being handed a Chicago congressional district by the local political bosses and he's in danger of becoming the kind of cog in the political wheel that Sarah most detested. And to make matters worse, he's started to see Sarah everywhere, becoming gradually more convinced that she's around, either as a ghost, a hallucination, or something else...The film dances from time period to time period, generally in a simplistic fashion aimed at making clear how Pierce's idealism has been tampered with. For at least the first half of the film, the audience is informed of temporal (and geographical) switches by subtitles at the bottom of the screen. I have to admit that this bothered me. If a director wants to do an unconventional piece of storytelling, he should either have faith in the cinematic literacy of the audience or else he shouldn't bother. Gordon's decision to constantly tell the audience where he's going, both through the subtitles (i.e. Chicago, 1973) and the editing marker of a burst of white light signaling flashes forward and back undermines his more intelligent efforts. The transitions in time are clunky and the film has a hard time segueing from romance to political thriller to tragedy to mystery. It's fine for a film to be a mix, but Waking the Dead feels like it's working too hard.I'm not really sure where the currency is in this story that drew Gordon to it. The notion of a man haunted by both a literal spirit from his past and the metaphorical spirit of his lost ideals is hardly fresh and the story feels like it may have had more pep back in the mid-80s, when the shift of counter culture members to the political Right was more of a hot idea.This being said, Gordon (who in my mind will always be the kid from Dressed to Kill) does excellent work with the actors in the film. This is especially true with Connelly, an actress who all too often finds herself cast for her curves and not enough for her acting muscle. Directors seem to get such a kick out of filming her body that they don't work with her performance. Gordon solves one of these problems by keeping Connelly in winter clothes for most of her performance. Rather than being the femme fatale, she's an Earth Mother. And it's a pleasant change. Sure she's beautiful and sexy, but she also has a lilting Southern accent (in most scenes) and a good screen presence.I didn't put an especially true on Crudup's performance because I've simply come to expect very fine work from him. Crudup's film work began with him sleeping through performances in Sleeper and Inventing the Abbotts, but since then he's given one amazing performance after another, carrying films as diverse as the hugely underrated Without Limits and this year's triple crown of Jesus's Son, Almost Famous, and this film. His ability to deliver dialogue speaks to his theater background and he holds the screen remarkably well for a man who, as this movie visually emphasizes on several occasions, isn't of great stature. He's one of the best young actors working and this is an amazing showcase for him. As his character becomes more desperate and erratic, Crudup's performance just becomes better.As I said, this film got better for me towards the end. However, there are huge patches where none of the scene transitions work at all. I'm giving it a 6\/10, but I certainly think it has its rewards.

So much even that I bought it on tape 5 years ago or so and when the Special Edition came on to the big screen I went to see it, all new, shiny and beautiful. Now I've got that Special Edition to my avail too and if I'm lucky I'll be seeing it on DVD in a couple of years, just as I hope I'll see The Phantom Menace on DVD in the next couple of years.Yesterday was the time for me, to go back in time and let my inner child be satisfied with the beginning of Luke Skywalkers adventures in this grand epic tale. But for me it was more than that. It was also some kind of a warmer upper for the next episode for which I'll have to wait another one and a half years &#150; SIGH -. And I must say again I was not disappointed with this movie (how could one be). It was as perfectly made as ever, bearing in mind the fact that this is the introduction, for this one is not as full of action as the other two episodes of this trilogy. Despite the fact that this is just the beginning I must say that George Lucas did a good job on this film. OK some of the effects are not too good compared to modern standards and neither is the editing or the action sequence direction (if you want to know what I mean, see The Phantom Menace and then watch this). But hey it was the 70's back then and you just compare event movies on this level from 1977 to moves from 1999. There you had all the critic I have about this masterpiece, which is and will be a true classic for me as long as I live. The reason for this film being classical are many, like the fact that it was the first real big event movie with good effects (outstanding for its time and budget) and also a good story, which is held together by the perfect portrayals of all the main characters (none of whom I'll have to introduce to you I bet, but I'll do it anyway). First of all of course there's Luke Skywalker, a young, maybe a bit naive, nice boy with a lot of hope and ideals who becomes entangled in the fight for freedom in this galaxy far, far away. Then there is Han Solo, an outlaw who smuggles and cares for nothing but money. Then of course Princess Leia, who immediately likes Luke and kind of dislikes Han Solo. Besides these characters there are also the 2 androids on the good side. R2D2, the always beeping repair droid and C-3PO the protocol droid, who is always a bit pessimistic and who delivers quite a few jokes. Not as many though as Han Solo, with his dry comments and his kind of odd way he addresses the princess. On the other side there is Darth Vader, whom all of you know and who is in my opinion the best villain ever. Never have I felt such emotions watching a villain on screen and even now there are times when my hairs just stand up when I hear him talk or do something.All of this is what made and makes this film trilogy so good and big. It is exciting, fun, moving and the characters are great. You immediately fall in love with all of the good guys in this movie. And that is also why episode, the Phantom Menace was just about as good as this one. I compare this episode A new Hope to The Phantom Menace because they are very much alike, for they both are introductions to a trilogy. The latter had nothing that truly moved you like in this one, but I must say, the well choreographed fighting scenes and the good effects made up for it. Maybe in The Phantom Menace there should have been more comedic elements as in this one and the characters should have been more gripping and adorable, but hey you can't have it all. Plus the people in The Phantom Menace were children and still had to develop many of their character. There are a few things I want to say here at the end of this comment about The Phantom Menace.

She did a wonderful job as Queen Amidala \/ Padmé Naberrie.

It's trying times for Bishop Henry Brougham (Niven), who's trying to raise enough funds for the construction of a cathedral for his church; he has a patron, the widow Mrs. Hamilton (Gladys Cooper), who will donate handsomely, but only if she is allowed to `call the shots' as it were.  Henry has become increasingly distracted by it all, as well as distant, a fact which hasn't gone unnoticed by his wife, Julia (Young).  When Henry prays for help, his prayers are answered in the form of an angel named Dudley (Grant), who announces himself to Henry and quickly manages to ingratiate himself with Julia.  And with Dudley's help, Henry ultimately discovers what is truly important in his life. \tKoster has crafted a pleasing and thoroughly entertaining movie that examines the good and bright side of human nature, and how refreshing it is in an era when so many films explore the dark side exclusively.  It's an elegant film with performances to match, with the charismatic Grant giving a relaxed and polished turn as the angel.  He fairly oozes charm, seemingly effortlessly, with a presence that is captivating to the other characters as well as to the audience; and he brings a sense of peace and serenity to the proceedings that gives total credibility to Dudley.  Grant makes it easy to believe that he's the angel he claims to be.  Young, as well, is simply outstanding as Julia, lending a dignity to the role while managing to remain down-to-earth and totally accessible.  There's an endearing warmth about her that makes her someone with whom you would like to spend more time; a gracious woman of classic beauty, both inside and out.  And Niven, as Henry, strikes a countenance that defines class, and he exacts the  sympathy of the viewer by making his character one with whom you can readily identify; his consternation becomes yours, and you breathe a little easier once you know Dudley is on the job. \tThe supporting cast includes Monty Woolley (Professor Wutheridge), James Gleason (Sylvester), the terrific Elsa Lanchester (Matilda), Sara Haden (Mildred), Regis Toomey (Mr. Miller) and young Karolyn Grimes (Debby).  Watching this film, it's easy to understand why it's been designated as `classic.'  Well written and stylishly delivered, `The Bishop's Wife' is an absorbing, memorable film that makes you realize (either again or, perhaps for many, the first time) why Grant, Young and Niven are considered `stars,' and how much great character actors like Woolley, Gleason and Lanchester contributed to so many great films during their careers.  For a satisfying movie experience, especially during the holidays, this is one film you should definitely check out; you won't be sorry.  I rate this one 10\/10.

And with Dudley's help, Henry ultimately discovers what is truly important in his life. \tKoster has crafted a pleasing and thoroughly entertaining movie that examines the good and bright side of human nature, and how refreshing it is in an era when so many films explore the dark side exclusively.  It's an elegant film with performances to match, with the charismatic Grant giving a relaxed and polished turn as the angel.  He fairly oozes charm, seemingly effortlessly, with a presence that is captivating to the other characters as well as to the audience; and he brings a sense of peace and serenity to the proceedings that gives total credibility to Dudley.  Grant makes it easy to believe that he's the angel he claims to be.  Young, as well, is simply outstanding as Julia, lending a dignity to the role while managing to remain down-to-earth and totally accessible.  There's an endearing warmth about her that makes her someone with whom you would like to spend more time; a gracious woman of classic beauty, both inside and out.  And Niven, as Henry, strikes a countenance that defines class, and he exacts the  sympathy of the viewer by making his character one with whom you can readily identify; his consternation becomes yours, and you breathe a little easier once you know Dudley is on the job. \tThe supporting cast includes Monty Woolley (Professor Wutheridge), James Gleason (Sylvester), the terrific Elsa Lanchester (Matilda), Sara Haden (Mildred), Regis Toomey (Mr. Miller) and young Karolyn Grimes (Debby).  Watching this film, it's easy to understand why it's been designated as `classic.'  Well written and stylishly delivered, `The Bishop's Wife' is an absorbing, memorable film that makes you realize (either again or, perhaps for many, the first time) why Grant, Young and Niven are considered `stars,' and how much great character actors like Woolley, Gleason and Lanchester contributed to so many great films during their careers.

It's trying times for Bishop Henry Brougham (Niven), who's trying to raise enough funds for the construction of a cathedral for his church; he has a patron, the widow Mrs. Hamilton (Gladys Cooper), who will donate handsomely, but only if she is allowed to `call the shots' as it were.

I liked Dogma, but it is not my favorite movie of his.First off, this movie goes a little overboard on the preaching.  This movie seems less like a comedy and more like religious theology.  Kevin Smith, the writer\/director\/producer of this film, has spent almost ten years writing this movie.  If you look at the end of his first movie, Clerks, it says, Jay and Silent Bob will return in Dogma. There were two movies in-between Clerks and Dogma, Mallrats and Chasing Amy.  So it's pretty obvious Smith put his heart and soul into this movie.  But had he made room for more comedy and less talk of how the humans `got it all wrong' in the Bible, I believe the movie could have been much, much better.Another problem is some of the jokes are pretty pointless.  Example The S**t Monster.  That's what it is, a monster that rises out of a toilet made of, you guessed it, excrement.  Not only does it have nothing to do with the plot; it's not even funny.  Another bad point is that Salma Heyak, one of the hottest women I've ever seen, can't act very well.Okay, enough bad stuff, on to the good.  Anything involving Loki and Bartleby is comic genius.

But it turned out to be a disappointment. It's an all right film, not offensive to the palate and the intelligence, but not special either. The story, of siblings meeting again after a childhood trauma has marked their lives (in what way, though? the movie doesn't tell us anything about that, other than they miss their dead parents. No kidding) is really unoriginal. Just at this time, there is at least another movie that deals EXACTLY with the same premise, Vertical Limit. While the genres these two movies operate in are wildly different, and one would be tempted to say that You Can Count on Me analyses the adult sibling relationship in more intimate terms (isn't that what indie movies of the drama\/comedy variety are supposed to do?), it seems to me that Vertical Limits has the advantage of actually not being boring. Okay, I'm too harsh perhaps. But have people really not seen adult sibling relationships depicted\/explored in movies before??!!! It seems to me that's just about all we see in movies. Randomly Rain Man, The Brothers McMullen, Hanging Up, The Godfather (yes?), Sister My Sister (YES?)... it's all over the place! If you want to see really DEEP explorations of sibling relationships, I propose you turn to Ingmar Bergman or Margaret Von Trotta. Hey, and why not? Girlfight! It does it pretty well (though maybe one would say they are not adults. Who cares, says I).Having said that I find the premise trite, I'm going to add that I found the development trite as well. Like, these two people love each other very very much but they lead very very different lives, and one of the two is troubled while the other one is stable, and the troubled one asks the stable one for money... It depicts the situation of just about any pair of siblings I know. Seriously. And the schmaltziness, oh the schmaltziness. We are supposed to UNDERSTAND that Sam and Terry love each other very much even though we are never told why and how, and the way we understand it is by 1) watching Sam welcome Terry home with unbounded happiness and 2) watching Terry say goodbye to Sam with unbounded sadness\/fortitude\/optimism\/whatever. Other than that, it's all about Terry going through the rituals of male bonding with Sam's little son late-night pool playing, fishing, construction, fistfighting. You would think by now filmmakers would have come up with something more original. And why isn't Terry bonding with his sister instead? Or is he bonding with the sister by bonding with her son? 'Cause if that is the case, we have such a major problem of dysfunctional lack of communication on our hands, it's not even funny. The bonding of uncle and nephew in fact pivots on CUTTING OFF the sister\/mother, as is the case with most male bonding.**SPOILER ALERT*** What the film does well, it seems to me, is show how Samantha GETS RID of all the loser men (brother included) that populate her life by deciding at some point to shed them, one by one. Well done, Sam! She even gets rid of the budding loser-boy mentality of her son by telling him to shape up and stop pining after his uncle.Laura Linney is terrific and breathes all the life into this otherwise supremely forgettable film.

The other half said it would be a horrible mess of a film with decent special effects.  So, I paid my money and went inside..I have a tradition with my reviews I list all the good points then the bad points, followed by a conclusion.  There are some spoilers, BUT BEFORE YOU STOP READING, please understand that you're doing yourself a favor by reading this before you see the movie.  I'm looking out for you people and you should thank me.Happy Premise Number One The GORGEOUS special effects.  I drooled in this movie.  No joke.Happy Premise Number Two That Ice Scene.  I'm sure you know about it already, and if you have skip this one.  If you haven't, read on.  There is this GREAT cat-and-mouse scene in an outer space ice field.  Two ships flying through giant shards of ice who can't find each other because the ice reflects hundreds of ships like a fun house mirror room.  One word FUN!Happy Premise Number 3 The sound.  Great sound my friend.  Good music too.Okay, enough `positive' things.  On to the fun part!  Oh Boy!Depressing Premise Number One The CHILDNESS!  This movie was targeted at teens and Generation Xers.  Well, it is a child's movie.  There is cussing, nudity (of the male buttocks persuasion), and violence, but trust me, this is a child's Disney movie.  It's thee way the characters look and talk. For example there is this character who is an alien and looks like a kangaroo. Literally, I'm not kidding floppy ears, long tail, and large, uh, kangaroo legs.  At first glance this movie looks like a Pokemon movie.  There is a bartender who is a roach.  Seriously, a really large roach.  That TALKS! Let's not even get into that frog thing, Gune.  Ugh!Depressing Premise Number Two The Characterization.  HOLY S***!  This is bad!  This goes against every thing I've ever learned as a writer.  Oh, God. Oh God, Oh God, Oh God!  This is truly bad!  Mere words cannot explain how bad these characters are developed.  AHHHHHHHHHHH!  Just. just take my word for it.Depressing premise Number 3 the animation.  Sure the 3D CG (computer graphics) are beautiful, but the 2D hand drawn animation, while not totally bad, looks bad when compared to the CG behind them.  Putting bad animation of people and aliens in the foreground on beautiful space 3D animation in the background JUST LOOKS TERRIBLE!  If you're going to have some average 2D animation, have everything be 2D.  If you want CG, at least improve the 2D so it can compete with the CG.  You get it?Depressing Premise Number 4 the Titan itself.  Here is a bit of spoiling, but please keep reading.  I'm doing you a favor.  I can deal with logic holes.  That's when, in a movie, something creates a paradox and just doesn't make any sense.  Take Terminator 2 for example.  The time travel thing is completely un-logical.  But the movie is still good.  The movie is so good that you don't notice the little piece of bad logic.  Well, when you put something that is ill logical in a bad movie, well, it shows. big time. The Titan is supposed to be special.  Well it is, and it also defies every law of physics, EVERY ONE!  It has the power to make a planet.  Yes, you read that right.  It can MAKE A PLANET.  Because Earth blew up, what's better than making another, huh?    Okay, this. this is so ridiculous that it. it. it makes my head hurt.  And, normally, I wouldn't care about this. But the movie doesn't let you forget this.  The entire ending takes place in the Titan, so this stupidity is very evident.  Oh, man.  I can deal with some unrealistic things.  I can.  I can deal with it up to a point. when it is the whole purpose of the movie.Depressing Premise Number 5 (it just keeps going doesn't it) The Drej. What the hell is this?  I think the idea of an alien made of pure energy is cool.  But if their ships are made of pure energy, what's the point?  Why not just make the ship a giant laser beam that homes in on its target. Another very, very big logic hole.  Believe me, there are many, many more.Conclusion (Whew! Almost done my friend!) This movie reeks.  Bad.  I like many bad movies with cool special effects.  Who doesn't?  Good old fun, popcorn movies are worth the $7.50.  But this is not.  This is one of the worst movies of the year.  I would put it in my worst-movies-ever-made pile, but the special effects save it from THAT fate.   This IS a bad movie folks.The DVD is pretty good if you want to test your system, or you want some great skeet shooting!4\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"24 December 2000","score":"","review":"  Titan A.

That's when, in a movie, something creates a paradox and just doesn't make any sense.  Take Terminator 2 for example.  The time travel thing is completely un-logical.  But the movie is still good.  The movie is so good that you don't notice the little piece of bad logic.  Well, when you put something that is ill logical in a bad movie, well, it shows. big time. The Titan is supposed to be special.  Well it is, and it also defies every law of physics, EVERY ONE!  It has the power to make a planet.  Yes, you read that right.  It can MAKE A PLANET.  Because Earth blew up, what's better than making another, huh?    Okay, this. this is so ridiculous that it. it. it makes my head hurt.  And, normally, I wouldn't care about this. But the movie doesn't let you forget this.  The entire ending takes place in the Titan, so this stupidity is very evident.  Oh, man.  I can deal with some unrealistic things.  I can.  I can deal with it up to a point. when it is the whole purpose of the movie.Depressing Premise Number 5 (it just keeps going doesn't it) The Drej. What the hell is this?  I think the idea of an alien made of pure energy is cool.  But if their ships are made of pure energy, what's the point?  Why not just make the ship a giant laser beam that homes in on its target. Another very, very big logic hole.  Believe me, there are many, many more.Conclusion (Whew! Almost done my friend!) This movie reeks.  Bad.  I like many bad movies with cool special effects.  Who doesn't?  Good old fun, popcorn movies are worth the $7.50.  But this is not.  This is one of the worst movies of the year.  I would put it in my worst-movies-ever-made pile, but the special effects save it from THAT fate.

E. is pretty to look at and painful to think about.I am a big space person.  I love it.  It interests me.  Space truly is an unexplored wonder that only science fiction can let us see.  Well, to this day I've only seen a few movies that accurately portray space.  2001 is at the top of the list. There are even less space-movies that are fun.  Star Wars is at the top of this short list.  So when I saw the teaser trailer for Titan A.E., I was extremely excited.  Then I learned it was animated.American animated movies have a bit of a pattern. they're made for children. Some movies aren't like South Park  However, most of them are Disney movies or Disney-carbon-copies.  So I was conflicted.I went to the movie with two frames of mind.  One half of my head thought the movie would be a science fiction landmark with gorgeous special effects, even if it was animated.  The other half said it would be a horrible mess of a film with decent special effects.  So, I paid my money and went inside..I have a tradition with my reviews I list all the good points then the bad points, followed by a conclusion.  There are some spoilers, BUT BEFORE YOU STOP READING, please understand that you're doing yourself a favor by reading this before you see the movie.  I'm looking out for you people and you should thank me.Happy Premise Number One The GORGEOUS special effects.  I drooled in this movie.  No joke.Happy Premise Number Two That Ice Scene.  I'm sure you know about it already, and if you have skip this one.  If you haven't, read on.  There is this GREAT cat-and-mouse scene in an outer space ice field.  Two ships flying through giant shards of ice who can't find each other because the ice reflects hundreds of ships like a fun house mirror room.  One word FUN!Happy Premise Number 3 The sound.  Great sound my friend.  Good music too.Okay, enough `positive' things.  On to the fun part!  Oh Boy!Depressing Premise Number One The CHILDNESS!  This movie was targeted at teens and Generation Xers.  Well, it is a child's movie.  There is cussing, nudity (of the male buttocks persuasion), and violence, but trust me, this is a child's Disney movie.  It's thee way the characters look and talk. For example there is this character who is an alien and looks like a kangaroo. Literally, I'm not kidding floppy ears, long tail, and large, uh, kangaroo legs.  At first glance this movie looks like a Pokemon movie.  There is a bartender who is a roach.  Seriously, a really large roach.  That TALKS! Let's not even get into that frog thing, Gune.  Ugh!Depressing Premise Number Two The Characterization.  HOLY S***!  This is bad!  This goes against every thing I've ever learned as a writer.  Oh, God. Oh God, Oh God, Oh God!  This is truly bad!  Mere words cannot explain how bad these characters are developed.  AHHHHHHHHHHH!  Just. just take my word for it.Depressing premise Number 3 the animation.  Sure the 3D CG (computer graphics) are beautiful, but the 2D hand drawn animation, while not totally bad, looks bad when compared to the CG behind them.  Putting bad animation of people and aliens in the foreground on beautiful space 3D animation in the background JUST LOOKS TERRIBLE!

But what really distinguishes this film, about four business    men who get more than they bargained for on a canoe trip, is that director John Boorman(Excalibur) breaks all the characters away from plain caricatures or stereotypes. So as the movie goes into full horror and suspense I really cared about all four men and what would happen to them.The acting is universally excellent. With Jon Voight(Midnight Cowboy, Enemy of the State) and Burt Reynolds(Boogie Nights, Striptease) leading the great cast. Jon Voight does probably the hardest thing of all in this film and that is making his transformation from family man to warrior very believable. Unlike Reynolds whose character is a warrior from the start, Voight's character transforms over the course of the movie. Ned Beatty(Life) is also good in an extremely hard role, come on getting raped by a hillbilly, while Ronny Cox turns in a believable performance.One thing that really made this movies powerful for me is that the villains were as terrifying as any I had ever seen.

Instead it is reflexive of true world problems-- coming overpopulation-- and the dilemma is to control an extremely powerful development for the positive use of mankind.  We can easily see the parallels with nuclear power, with the hydrogen bomb being the monster which can be let loose upon the world by modern science.  In the movie, of course, the monster takes the form of an 8-legged creature grown thousands of times normal size, living by instincts which compel it to seek cattle and people for food instead of insects.For science fiction to be worth watching, I think the *fiction* part of it must be cautiously limited, and this is why I care little for space travel movies and zooming around the galaxy.  TARANTULA upholds this requirement quite well.  The setting-- a small desert community where people generally know each other and each other's business-- is believable.  The reactions of the sheriff, the lab assistant, and the rancher to unexplained phenomenon are believable and expected.But the wide desert area covered by the doctor in his practice and by the sheriff in law enforcement leave a vast region for the escaped tarantula to grow to such a gigantic size without being sighted.  Since the entire action takes place in a few days, this does not become a glaring flaw, as an airplane from miles away could spot the creature, and the strange markings in the sand and waste discarded would be discovered by *someone* in a short time.  Still, the movie assumed the existence of a nutrient capable of producing such growth, but did not assume other nonscientific possibilities, so stopping the monster had to be done through means which were known.There are some logical questions in the progress of events.  First, why a tarantula as a test specimen?  A baby tarantula is no bigger than a gnat and crawls on its mother's thorax as one of a hundred.  The tarantula's age is posted as '22 days' on the chart, but perhaps that means the days since first injection-- how could the professor inject one the size of a gnat? The professor must be at least *slightly* mad to secretly carry on this experiment after his 2 associates are killed by the nutrient they developed. But does he really think all his giant specimens are killed in the fire in the laboratory?  There would have been some remains, especially since he was able to put out the fire before the entire house was burned.  If he did not find the remains of all of them, he was more mad than 'slightly.'  And he was more determined to have the credit for the amazing nutrient than he was concerned about the enormous risk if he knew, as he should have, that the tarantula-- at least-- had escaped.  Yet when his own acromigaly is so advanced he can no longer hide it, he appears to really believe that all his specimens had burned.  BTW, at the growth rate of the spider, which was almost too big for his glass cage at the lab scene, what was the professor going to do with him later that day?Then, since the doctor had analyzed the unusual substance as related to insect venon, he makes the right conclusion when the professor tells about the tarantula.  Bu then-- he flies 200 miles to confirm that conslusion with the state agricultural lab?  Wow! he is the only one who knows the truth about the creeping terror in that area and he is that far away and had not told anyone this?  Of course, he would not expect to be believed, I suppose, but near the end the Air Force seems to believe it and sends the napalm-carrying bombers.The movie is also rather 'cheesy' in the scene where the doctor and the lab assistant take a seat in the desert and say a few words about the desert hiding its secret from man.  The woman says, You make it sound so-- *creepy*.  I bet it took a lot of takes for them to keep their faces straight when they shot that one.

We can easily see the parallels with nuclear power, with the hydrogen bomb being the monster which can be let loose upon the world by modern science.  In the movie, of course, the monster takes the form of an 8-legged creature grown thousands of times normal size, living by instincts which compel it to seek cattle and people for food instead of insects.For science fiction to be worth watching, I think the *fiction* part of it must be cautiously limited, and this is why I care little for space travel movies and zooming around the galaxy.  TARANTULA upholds this requirement quite well.  The setting-- a small desert community where people generally know each other and each other's business-- is believable.  The reactions of the sheriff, the lab assistant, and the rancher to unexplained phenomenon are believable and expected.But the wide desert area covered by the doctor in his practice and by the sheriff in law enforcement leave a vast region for the escaped tarantula to grow to such a gigantic size without being sighted.  Since the entire action takes place in a few days, this does not become a glaring flaw, as an airplane from miles away could spot the creature, and the strange markings in the sand and waste discarded would be discovered by *someone* in a short time.
