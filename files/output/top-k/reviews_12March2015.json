The film that supposedly started it all and re-awoke the dawn of slashers. The granddaddy. The idea that was remade years later by insanity led Rob Zombie. The one that EVERYONE knows even if they are not a fan of the horror genre. Any reviews that exist for Halloween are by the dozen. Everyone tends to have an opinion on this film and are not shy in expressing it. There are copious reviews on IMDb that cover it and certainly on every individual horror website that exists. In a way that makes it hard to write a review that has been done before and probably to greater effect. But it doesn't hurt to try. Halloween is, on its own merit, a great effective chiller with strong performances across the board and a wonderful final twist that still is adapted and used today. Laurie Strode (played by Jamie Lee Curtis) has been asked to babysit two of her neighbours kids on Halloween night which dutifully, she agrees to. However a few days before, Mike Myers, a psychotic kid who killed his sister on a dark and grainy night, escapes from the prison he was confined to. Determined to continue his killing spree, his sights are firmly set on Laurie and her friends. And when Halloween arrives, the blood on display is all too real. Jamie Lee Curtis, what can be said... this was her role; her moment, the defining point of her career. And yes, she plays it to beautiful, undercut effect. As the shy, residing and intelligent girl from high school she's never too obvious, never too reclusive and because of this Curtis creates one of the best female antagonists in horror. Someone who becomes stronger and more self assured as the film grows and someone we genuinely will to survive. She doesn't disappoint.Dr. Loomis played wonderfully by Donald Pleasence is certainly one of my favourite performers throughout this film. He's not overbearing, never too sharp but quick witted when needed. His genuine concern for Laurie feels honest and he's seems such a nice guy. You actually concern yourself that something might happen to but thankfully he comes through shining like the brightest star in the sky. In spite of the 18 certificate, the gore is not that prominent. Anything you do see happens to be done by the shadow of night so it's not visible. If I can surmise the age rating probably is a result more so of the sex scenes because whilst you don't really see anything, just the insinuation, it's enough to create quite a stir. Actually I like that the blood is not constantly on show. Too many horror films can rely on just the gore to see there way through and forget in part about the storyline, Halloween combines both succinctly. The art of the gore and the storyline that's both elegant and consistent makes Halloween something to be cherished. Having spoken of everything in regards to this film it's impossible to not mention one of the most beloved aspects of Halloween. The score! Always loved, often emulated, never bettered. It's partway creepy, that kind tickle of the ivory in the background, and wonderfully sweet against the ears. I admit it can be hard to listen to the main tune and not get goosebumps shuddering against your skin. A great asset overall. You can understand why this film is loved by so many, a beautiful horror story that focuses on the art of storytelling rather than just trying to elicit a reaction. Halloween is a classic example of such an urban legend slightly altered and done to wonderful effect. The characters are likable, certainly Laurie and Dr. Loomis. And even others such as P. J. Soles are memorable. And of course Halloween is the introduction of what becomes one of the most beloved characters in horror annuls, Michael Myers. That soulless mask with the most undiscerning features, the unnerving manner in how he walks; never a run. It's easy to understand why Myers has become as infamous as Freddy, Jason even Leatherface. To anyone who is a novice to horror, Halloween is one of those films that will be on everyone's to see list and it is not hard to see why. It's effective, chilling storytelling with great use of a genuinely tingling score. I recommend it to anyone yet to see it, recommend watching it immediately. John Carpenter is a visionary when it comes to horror. Watch this and remember how slashers are meant to be. A gem.
