The soundtrack is terrifying and haunting, it keeps the audience on their toes throughout the entire film. The cinematography is very cinematic, including numerous tracking shots, making the film looks beautiful and makes the location seems more real. The performances are good for most of the cast but Jack Nicholson's performance is over the top, his performance could have been more restraint early on in the film. But it does make the film more entertaining and remember-able. Characters could have had more development to define the characters more; this could have made them more interesting. Also some back-story could have been used to define and to make them more interesting as well. Good dialogue that works in the film. A very intriguing plot that only gets better as the film goes on. I enjoy how the plot unfolds growing ever so creepy and unpredictable as the time goes on. Great unique visuals are used frequently giving the film a interesting look.

It was intended to reopen the book though it was closing it in a way. Batman was not the flier we thought he was but he was only a very good acrobat who had very good weapons that threw cables all around and helped him get out of the muddy marshes of life right into the sky. At the end of his metal thread he looked more like a spider swinging in the wind than a bat, but let's say he was close enough.The main rewriting was not about that technical side of things. The bat mobile was not the great war tool it was supposed to be. It was awkward and did not play a great role. What's more the flier version of it ended down on the steps to the cathedral with Batman inside. Not very swift that bat mobile. But well you have to do with what you have and nothing else.The main rewriting was not the car nor the plane nor any of these vulgar means of transportation. The main rewriting was the girl who went through all kinds of traps, tricks, fears and frights in the hands of the Joker or in the hands of Batman. Luckily or unluckily she fell in love. The poor darling! In love with a bat, and they say it drinks blood. But at the same time that makes Batman a real man who can fall in love and have an adventure with a woman. Once again, in 1989 we were still very far away from Proposition 8 in California and the rulings of the Supreme Court in 2014 or is it 2015. It was so earth-shaking that we don't even remember the date.But Batman knows how to do it in style with champagne and luxurious British cars with the driving wheel on the right side, and door opening the way they haven't opened for now more than fifty years. That makes the film really attractive and the girl very remarkable since she is able to keep a secret. For a press photographer that is rather amazing.

The value of his gold will then increase to ten times its original value.'Goldfinger' features the first prologue scene that has nothing to do with the main plot of the film. We as an audience though are more than content. This adrenaline pumping action scene pushes the film forward and ensures that we remain thrilled from beginning to end. It amounts to a minor scene; Bond planting bombs in a heroin factory, yet it is intoxicating because of how quickly it draws us into the film without the use of exposition.'Goldfinger' is notable for its gadgets. They are provided courtesy of Q and are rather fantastical and ingenious. His car alone has bullet proof windows, front mounted machine guns and an ejector seat for the uninvited passenger. Goldfinger never takes its self too seriously and that's refreshing to see.Apart from the heart pounding climax that takes place in Fort Knox, there is another sequence slightly more effective and memorable. This is because it is compromised solely of quick and witty dialogue exchanges. This is the laser beam sequence and it remains tense for several reasons. The look of terror on Bond's face, the increasingly suspenseful music by John Barry and the witticisms that come across unforced and with the right amount of power.I'm not sure how the film makers got away with giving the leading lady the name of Pussy Galore. But it allows for unstoppable laughs whenever Bond whispers her name. She is herself an unstoppable force, determined, independent and loyal to Goldfinger. You buy her eventual love for Bond and she even warns him You can turn off the charm, I'm immune.Sean Connery delivers his best performance in 'Goldfinger'. You can tell how he has matured and settled into the role with ease. Gert Frobe as Goldfinger is not intimidating, but great fun to watch as he laps up every second on screen.'Goldfinger' is a rare example of the perfect Bond film that holds up even for today's standards set for an action film. Stunning sets, gorgeous girls, vicious villains, sublime set pieces and memorable music. The list goes on and on. Most amazingly of all 'Goldfinger' remains entertaining from first frame to last.

This Bond outing means business. Gone is any sense of calm, down to earth villains and the plot slowly inching forward. Here we have gadgets galore, double entendres and sophistication marked with a stylish tuxedo.007 is given the task of looking into Auric Goldfinger's dealings and affairs. Goldfinger is smuggling his gold from country to country and if Bond can find a connection, then his agency can come down hard on him. Goldfinger though has bigger plans. To break into the gold depository bank at Fort Knox and make the gold radioactive so that no one can access it for half a decade. The value of his gold will then increase to ten times its original value.'Goldfinger' features the first prologue scene that has nothing to do with the main plot of the film. We as an audience though are more than content. This adrenaline pumping action scene pushes the film forward and ensures that we remain thrilled from beginning to end. It amounts to a minor scene; Bond planting bombs in a heroin factory, yet it is intoxicating because of how quickly it draws us into the film without the use of exposition.'Goldfinger' is notable for its gadgets. They are provided courtesy of Q and are rather fantastical and ingenious. His car alone has bullet proof windows, front mounted machine guns and an ejector seat for the uninvited passenger. Goldfinger never takes its self too seriously and that's refreshing to see.Apart from the heart pounding climax that takes place in Fort Knox, there is another sequence slightly more effective and memorable. This is because it is compromised solely of quick and witty dialogue exchanges. This is the laser beam sequence and it remains tense for several reasons. The look of terror on Bond's face, the increasingly suspenseful music by John Barry and the witticisms that come across unforced and with the right amount of power.I'm not sure how the film makers got away with giving the leading lady the name of Pussy Galore. But it allows for unstoppable laughs whenever Bond whispers her name. She is herself an unstoppable force, determined, independent and loyal to Goldfinger. You buy her eventual love for Bond and she even warns him You can turn off the charm, I'm immune.Sean Connery delivers his best performance in 'Goldfinger'. You can tell how he has matured and settled into the role with ease. Gert Frobe as Goldfinger is not intimidating, but great fun to watch as he laps up every second on screen.'Goldfinger' is a rare example of the perfect Bond film that holds up even for today's standards set for an action film. Stunning sets, gorgeous girls, vicious villains, sublime set pieces and memorable music. The list goes on and on. Most amazingly of all 'Goldfinger' remains entertaining from first frame to last.

The excellence in Demme's direction comes from knowing what to linger on and what to hint at. He milks that first encounter of the two leads to its extremes, leading a young Foster down into the underground cells, past a room flooded in frantic red light (along with strict instruction and warning) and finally along that long corridor. The other prisoners leer and jeer as expected, but arriving at the end is a glass cell and that still and unblinking monster in Lecter. This very first conversation is impeccably shot; they trade blows and tight POVs immerse us into their mind's inner sanctums, and as Clarice's thin facade and accent is shattered by a few choice words, she is pushed off centre, disorientated and vulnerable. The plexiglass walls augment the atmosphere of unnerving intimacy between the unconventional pair. Like several other figures throughout the film, Lecter's male gaze seeps into the frame from front on and in extreme close-up, hungrily eating up Clarice's insecure psyche and exposing the screaming of the lambs in her dreams. Foster plays this part magnificently, not with acts of bravado, but in the nervous addressing of a room full of male police officers questioning her authority, in the low-class accent she tries desperately to mask, and in her sense of honesty and goodness that sets her apart and convinces Lecter to take a liking to her. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? We experience this in the rather nervous way her POV is presented to us, gazing absent-mindedly in every new scene, scanning the surroundings, and trying to avoid the sexualising and trivialising gazes of the male dominated law enforcement agency, which she must navigate with self awareness and a casual, tactful disposition despite it evidently worrying her. Lecter's eyes are also fixated intensely, but not on her body. Apart from the harrowing monologues of the screaming of the lambs from Foster, there are other ways that Demme increasingly notes her state of mind. Her introduction has her determined in the midst of male power and domination, no better expressed than when she enters an elevator full of male agents a good head taller than her. Mid investigation, she creeps over to the slightly ajar door, and with a smooth edit, we are transported to her youth, her father's funeral that began the terrifying downward spiral of her life. She makes the initial breakthrough with Lecter and expresses her frustration at being used by her superior, Jack Crawford, and the fading light within the tunnel is forced back into the frame via the car mirror, opposite Clarice's increasingly independence and wariness. And in that brilliant misdirection just before the climax, two operations are crosscut with the utmost precision, the complex man power of the SWAT take-down, and the pleasant but curious face of Clarice, not yet aware that she has stumbled onto Buffalo Bill.Opposite her is the demented yet strangely eloquent and intelligent Hannibal Lecter, a character which Anthony Hopkins lifts into classic film territory with his performance. When a golden pen is cast wayward in the holding cell, we are given a moment's glance, like Lecter and his eyes light up behind that grotesque and terrifying mask, Hopkins immediately conveying his intentions. We fear him so much more for the things unseen, our imagination going haywire as we witness him pull off a bloodied mask of skin in the ambulance, or as we stumble into the third floor with a officer hung up like a gory tapestry, or in that final haunting credits sequence, as he plots the meal of his former nemesis. Yet he remains staunchly interested in Clarice; in a fleeting close-up where they exchange files, their fingers touch for the only time in the film, yet we don't flinch, because strangely like Clarice, we know that he means her no harm. It's a sort of agitated confidence, after the brutality of Lecter's escape that flashes with terrifying aggressiveness and disregard for human life. His advice and assistance steers Clarice into the terrifying climax in the basement, the tensest sequence in the film. Shore's score simmers menacingly beneath the surface as Clarice prepares to enter each room of uncharted territory, the sound design magnifying each heavy breath and gasp, as well as the faint cries of the kidnapped daughter and the poodle's frenzied barking. As she kicks open each door, the camera doesn't immediately peer in and reveal its empty non-threatening contents, but holds onto Foster's panicked sweeping glance and brief window of relief. This forbids us from gaining a foothold onto the scene, and like Clarice we are constantly looking over our shoulder, even more so when the lights are switched off and she is forced to fumble around while the eerie night vision places us right in those slimy hands of Bill. The dread is perhaps a little cheapened by the slow-motion reaction and gunshot, but all the same, a film shows its excellence in sustaining tension when you are forced to back away a little. Here is the only horror film to win Best Picture, one which drives the audience and the horrors of imagination along the edge, brimming with nervous apprehension and fear. Best served with some fava beans and a nice Chianti.

Chosen to be shot in black-and-white rather than color, the tone is often terrifying, and the acting is chilling as well. The film is loaded with symbolism, and terrific composition that is just subtle enough to not give away the plot, but tells an educated audience member everything they need to know from a single frame.Psycho benefits from masterful direction from Alfred Hitchcock, who embodies what is considered perfect mise en scene, by making almost every object in frame important in some way. The composition of the film is extremely dense, whether it be symbolic, or narratively relevant, almost every frame is crucial for the film. A great example of this is the parlor scene, in which we see Norman Bates invite Marion into his parlor. One could argue the plot of the rest of the film is told through symbolism, and composition. In the scene the composition very heavily foreshadows the coming events of the film, as we see predatory birds and predatory sexualized paintings in the parlor, concurrent with Norman. As the audience sees a large Owl, in attacking position, on eye level with Norman, the meaning is clear. This composition is consistently used throughout the scene. Another example is Marion is usually in camera with ravens, very clearly foreshadowing her fate. It's this dense and brilliant composition that makes Psycho a great example of Alfred Hitchcock's genius. Another thing that is evident throughout the film is Hitchcock's style, whether it be his obsession with birds, his love of particular shots, or his undeniable voyeuristic use of the camera. Composition is the director's most direct route into the mind of the audience, if one knows what to look for they can learn about a director from his composition. What we see is Hitchcock likes shots that feel as if the audience is looking at the characters through something, whether it be a windshield, window, or hole in the wall. Using these shots Hitchcock almost makes the camera feel like another person viewing the film. It's the use of voyeuristic shots, and the attempt to make the camera feel like another character that subtly brings the audience to Norman Bate's level, at one point we even see shots from his perspective. I suspect this was done to muddle the message of who is right, and who is wrong, because the audience is both off put with the creepiness of Norman, but is also lead to be sympathetic. In essence Hitchcock makes a movie where we see no truly good characters, but no truly bad characters either. In the end Hitchcock created a masterful horror film that could still stand as one of the best all time. The black-and-white color, dense composition, and uneasy score make Psycho all the more terrifying. All-the-while setting the standard for how filmmakers would develop characters for years to come.

I love the magical aspect of the movie and of course Robin Williams. Hook (1991) acts as a sequel to Peter Pan. The movie answers many questions we may have. What would have happened if Peter grew up? What type of job would he get? Would he have a family? Director Steven Spielberg puts a clever twist on the old classic Disney cartoon, Peter Pan, and makes it new again for so many. Peter Banning (Robin Williams) is a grumpy lawyer who lives his life too seriously to remember he used to be the famous Peter Pan. Peter, his wife Moira, and their children Jack and Maggie, take a trip to London to visit Granny Wendy (Maggie Smith). While in London, Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman) kidnaps Jack and Maggie and takes them to Neverland. With the help of Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts) Peter goes to Neverland. The problem is Peter doesn't remember anything about Neverland. He is lead to the lost boys who try to help him remember who he really is, Peter Pan. With the help of the lost boys and Tinkerbell, Peter is able to defeat Captain Hook and save his kids. The new character, Rufio, took over for Pan after he left Neverland and has been leading the lost boys ever since. Hook also references another classic fairy tale. Peter's children were named Jack and Maggie for a reason. Jack and Maggie are the English translations of the German names Hansel and Gretel. Just like Hansel and Gretel, Jack and Maggie are taken away from their family. The movie teaches us to really appreciate everything as if we are kids again. The film is a reminder that we should keep in touch of our inner child and never let go. The acting by Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman is incredible as always as well as most of the cast. Robin plays a great contrast between playing a serious character and the playful childlike character we have come to expect of him. Dustin Hoffman really got into his character Hook. He was on set for two months before he started shooting just so he could get into character. My only complaint is maybe Julia Roberts wasn't the best choice for the part, though she and Robin do have a few good moments together. Not only were the actors outstanding, so was the music by John Williams. It really draws you into the story. Spielberg did in this movie as he does in all his movies. His use of imagination and creativity makes you want to walk into the screen and become a part of the world he has created. The dinner scene where Peter starts to remember who he is, the lost boys use their imagination and pretend they are eating real food when there is actually nothing there. Once Peter starts to use his imagination, a banquet of food appears on the table. This is one particular scene that makes you want to be a part of the movie. Like all movies this one too has its flaws. It is a little slow paced at some points and has a few plot holes. There are numerous continuity issues. Also in a few shots you can see a crew member or camera reflection or even lights hanging down on the sound stage. Spielberg even said he was not happy with the final turn out of the movie. He said that if the movie was made today, the design of Neverland may be more to his liking. Though it is not a Disney film, it does capture the magic of Disney and the magic of the original Disney cartoon. It is full of action and adventure and a whole lot of fantasy. It is just an overall fun movie. If you are a fan of Robin Williams, Steven Spielberg, or Peter Pan, I really recommend this movie. Even if the before doesn't apply to you, despite its flaws, it is still a very enjoyable movie for everyone. Bangerang.

The Wizard of Oz, on the contrary, remains a true classic, one that withstands the test of time as both an unforgettable visual work of art and a fantastic piece of storytelling. The film is adapted from L. Frank Baum's novel of a similar title, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Although it is not traditionally regarded as fairy tale, it contains several recognizable elements of one, such as themes of childhood and a conflict of good and evil.The film was quite groundbreaking for it's time, being one of the first movies shot in Technicolor. One of the most under-appreciated aspects of the film is its cinematography. The story begins in sepia tone, with the main character, Dorothy. Following a chaotic sequence involving a tornado in which she is knocked unconscious, the movie really starts to get interesting. The camera jumps to a long- shot frame of her house falling rapidly through the sky, only for it to land with her unharmed. Dorothy climbs out of bed, and the screen slowly pans to the right as she walks over to the door. This creates an air of suspense, and when she opens the door to look outside, the audience sees a fantasy landscape bursting with color. The way in which the movie transitions to Technicolor is beautifully done, and could even be described as psychedelic. Now that is how you grab an audience's attention.The Wizard of Oz is a brilliantly scripted movie with a story that all ages can enjoy. There is hardly a dull moment for the entire 101-minute run time, and the tale of Dorothy and the people she meets flows seamlessly. Dorothy's friends, named the Cowardly Lion, the Tin Woodman, and the Scarecrow are all engaging. They are classic fairy tail characters- lovable, but retain human qualities and self-perceived flaws. The dialogue amongst them is quirky and fun, adding humor and comedic relief to a film primarily about adventure. Dorothy is sixteen years old, however she carries the demeanor of a child throughout the story. She is portrayed as naïve and blunt, and needs reassurance and support from her friends. As with many fairy tales, her end goal is to make it back home to Kansas. Another overarching theme in the movie that is common to fairy tales is the conflict of good and evil that Dorothy gets stuck between, where there is an ongoing battle between Glinda the Good Witch of the East and the Wicked Witch of the West. Without giving away any spoilers, The Wizard of Oz surprisingly includes revenge and death (something native to traditional fairy tales) within this ongoing battle, something you certainly wouldn't encounter in today's world within a movie marketed for children. The obvious influence of classic fairy tales goes over quiet well, and gives the story another layer of complexity, granting lessons for children to learn from the story while providing older audiences themes to analyze and compare to fairy tales they grew up watching.The story of Dorothy's journey through Oz is more than just an adventure with an added fairy tale twist. The Wizard of Oz is a classic film, an American staple, and a masterfully crafted work of art. Everyone, from kids to parents and casual movie goers to film buffs can appreciate this movie.

The Wizard of Oz is a classic film, an American staple, and a masterfully crafted work of art. Everyone, from kids to parents and casual movie goers to film buffs can appreciate this movie. The Wizard of Oz isn't just a must- watch, it's a necessary watch.

Basically walking the streets of Moscow, Russia, are happy couple Veronika (BAFTA nominated Tatyana Samoylova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov), they are laughing together and are very much in love, they look in the morning sky to see the cranes are flying. Arriving at Veronika's house they discuss a rendezvous at the bank of the river, but World War II has started and Boris, a factory worker, is drafted in to volunteer and join the army, this occurs before Veronika's birthday, and they do not have the chance to say goodbye. As time passes Veronika waits for news from Boris, she spends some time with his cousin Mark (Aleksandr Shvorin), she is raped by him, but for some bizarre reason she marries him, she obviously moves on from the attack, but this marriage does not stop her waiting for Boris to return. The soldiers do return from battle, Boris is nowhere to be seen, Veronika is in floods of tears when she discovers that he is indeed dead, his friend Stepan (Valentin Zubkov) makes a speech that no-one will forget those who died in the war, and on a hopeful note Veronika hands out a bouquet of flowers to the returning soldiers. Also starring Vasiliy Merkurev as Fyodor Ivanovich, Svetlana Kharitonova as Irina, Konstantin Kadochnikov as Volodya and Antonina Bogdanova as Grandmother. Samoylova is good as the young hospital worker parted with her lover and in a loveless marriage, the love story element is fine, but the most eye-catching moments for me are in the battlefields of the Second World War, it is not the most exciting film I have seen of this sort, but it has some good moments, all in all it's not a bad romantic drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source. Worth watching!

While being a classical film, reusing old plot points and themes, it had a sense of realism as well, whether that be because of the realistic characters created, or the touchier subject matter. It differs greatly from the first film we watched Modern Times in it's message and it's approach.The message of this film seems to be If you put your head down and work hard, then you can get through anything. This message is very optimistic, and almost the opposite of Modern Times which was very pessimistic. This film is also a perfect example of Cinema offering an escape, it's not as subtle as Modern Times, but is still hidden under a comedy, so in essence people could see the film, and enjoy it without knowing the message. The message is very optimistic, through the message and characters it offered audiences a chance to hope when times were very tough.I would go so far as to say the whole film was an allegory for society and the American Dream, saying yes times are tough, but it will get better. The characters are relatable because they were imperfect, they weren't stereotypes, and they resembled the masses, which made the allegory all the more powerful. Audiences could see themselves in characters that would persevere and eventually succeed, further reinforcing that the film offered hope to the masses. Whether or not Capra knew we were closer to the end than the beginning than the end of the great depression is irrelevant, because films like this helped America get out of the great depression and redefined the American Dream. The impact arguably was this film, and others like it helped people be more comfortable being themselves as they were finally being represented in media, they weren't being told to be a stereotype anymore. The impact was both good and bad, as people began to be more comfortable being themselves, society became more open, and less judgemental, but things like divorce rates, and single parent families also rose. Whether or not the impact of this film is good or bad is totally subjective, but I would lean towards positive, because optimism is usually a good thing to give people. Looking at the advanced camera-work, lighting, the countless films it's inspired, along with the timelessness of the message, It Happened One Night may be the most influential films of all time. I know it sounds bold, but when one considers that it was a film unafraid to tell the masses be who you want to be, that's a message that people still haven't fully accepted today. It also helped redefine, and reinstate hope in the American dream, while offering audiences an escape. It's a very well-rounded film, and it is still present in society today. ","genre":null},{"date":"1 October 2015","score":"","review":" It Happened One Night is a great Classical film about society and the American Dream. While being a classical film, reusing old plot points and themes, it had a sense of realism as well, whether that be because of the realistic characters created, or the touchier subject matter. It differs greatly from the first film we watched Modern Times in it's message and it's approach.The message of this film seems to be If you put your head down and work hard, then you can get through anything. This message is very optimistic, and almost the opposite of Modern Times which was very pessimistic. This film is also a perfect example of Cinema offering an escape, it's not as subtle as Modern Times, but is still hidden under a comedy, so in essence people could see the film, and enjoy it without knowing the message. The message is very optimistic, through the message and characters it offered audiences a chance to hope when times were very tough.I would go so far as to say the whole film was an allegory for society and the American Dream, saying yes times are tough, but it will get better. The characters are relatable because they were imperfect, they weren't stereotypes, and they resembled the masses, which made the allegory all the more powerful. Audiences could see themselves in characters that would persevere and eventually succeed, further reinforcing that the film offered hope to the masses. Whether or not Capra knew we were closer to the end than the beginning than the end of the great depression is irrelevant, because films like this helped America get out of the great depression and redefined the American Dream. The impact arguably was this film, and others like it helped people be more comfortable being themselves as they were finally being represented in media, they weren't being told to be a stereotype anymore. The impact was both good and bad, as people began to be more comfortable being themselves, society became more open, and less judgemental, but things like divorce rates, and single parent families also rose. Whether or not the impact of this film is good or bad is totally subjective, but I would lean towards positive, because optimism is usually a good thing to give people. Looking at the advanced camera-work, lighting, the countless films it's inspired, along with the timelessness of the message, It Happened One Night may be the most influential films of all time.
