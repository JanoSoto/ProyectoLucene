For a while, I didn't think I could watch another movie after seeing Lawrence of Arabia, because no other film could compare! As I slowly came back to reality, I realized how little I knew about the history behind this movie. Of course I knew about the war, but I never really knew about the Arabs' struggle and fight as they fought to preserve their way of life. This movie made me want to learn more and read up about the Arab's side. I also became very interested in T.E. Lawrence himself. The inner struggles he has of loving a country but being unable to live there because of his race was very thought provoking. The director, David Lean, does a spectacular job, especially depicting those long desert scenes; I couldn't take my eyes of the screen. David Lean also directed another excellent film Bridge on the River Kwai (no wonder I liked it so much); however, no film can compare with Lawrence of Arabia.Peter O'toole does an EXCELLENT (for lack of a better word) performance in this movie; he is just as the real Lawrence was. I personally don't believe the quiet, intuitive Lawrence could have been played by any other person. He is a truly spectacular, hard working actor. There is no other like him. How come you no longer see great movies like Lawrence of Arabia anymore? Lawrence of Arabia is a classic example of a film that took a long time to make, took a lot of money, good actors, and just plain determination. Nowadays, no one cares about the quality of the movie, they just want to throw a bunch of scenes together and whip out the movie as fast as the producers can. All anyone cares about is the money aspect of it...they want to make a big profit. How come we can't make a good quality movie anymore? Is it because no one is capable of doing it anymore? Did we forget how to make a good film? No...it's because all the film industry cares about is money. In the few cases where someone DOES make a good movie, the theaters don't show it because they fear it will lose money. It makes me disgusted. Ugh. Thankfully, however, we can go to the video store and check out a movie like Lawrence of Arabia. If it wasn't for that, I don't know what I would do.

If you like a mystery ... then you may love this one, but it may not have any conclusion or anything you like.I have heard a lot of comparisons of this movie since I saw it and I am puzzled as to why none of them refer to Jacob's ladder or even 2001, or more specifically Hal 9000 in 2001 A Space Oddessy. There are a lot of similarities in both. The Bunny Rabbit (or someone in a deaths-head rabbit costume) is Hal 9000, but with a few twists. Hal had power over the people on the space ship. The astronauts were afraid of Hal and rightly so. The rabbit is also something to be feared but it also seemed to help Donnie at one point. Donnie was bound to the rabbit and he did not know why.

Donnie tries to find answers with the teachers and as good as some of them are, not all are able to help, because they are not allowed to talk about god.

I have no idea if I just gave the movie away or not, because even if I did, I did not - but you can make that call if you wish.I think the movie could have done more to stress the end of the world - or not. This was not clear, as many things are not so clear in life. Was the old woman caught in a similar situation and simply beat down the point where she stands in the street and checks her mail box 16 hours a day? What did she really write and why? Why did the movie skip over so many things so quickly. Clearly Donnie's world was about to end, or did he get a choice. What really was that choice and why did all those things happen when he went to the dead lady's house? Was she really dead - of course not, but maybe she was dead inside.As you can imagine death plays a heavy roll - similar to what happened in Jacob's Ladder, but with many significant differences. These differences are best found when watching the movies.I've heard there might be a directors cut for Donnie Darko - I really hope so, because while this was was very good, the Directors Cut (DC) has the potential to be killer -)I would give the story a 9 (because it could probably have been told better and well its not perfect - or is it?)

","genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"30 January 2005","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Every time the name David Fincher is mentioned, people I know start talking about Fight Club (1999). It seems like everybody has nothing but great things to say about that film...just like The Matrix (1999) and The 6th Sense (1999) which came out the same year. They're all good films, but they have never grabbed me the same way as they've grabbed everybody else. Fight Club tries to hard to be something it never manages to become, in my opinion. But let's not get out of line. Let's talk about another film by David Fincher instead. Se7en....now THAT'S one special film.This is one of those films that I feel is best to watch, when knowing as little as possible about the plot, but I can keep it to a minimum William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and David Mills (Brad Pitt) are two detectives, an old veteran and a young newcomer, that's being hired for a murder-case. This turns out to be a case of a serial-killer, and the killer's victims is people committing one of the seven deadly sins Gluttony, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and wrath.Serial-killers, detectives, thrillers...crime-films like this are not the types I watch too often. So let's just say that Seven is not only one of the few that I like, but probably the best film I've seen in it's genre (I don't remember much from the one time I saw Jonathan Demme's classic The Silence Of The Lambs (1991) many years ago). It's dark, stylish, well-made and very thrilling. And if David Fincher should be labeled a movie-genius (something that many of my friends thinks), then Se7en should be labeled his masterpiece, I think.The most brilliant part of the film hits you right from the beginning of....the mood. This film creates a dark and dusky mood that fits the plot and setting perfect, and creeps up under your skin and glues you to the screen. Techniqually and visually, this film is overwhelming and offers everything I expect from a thriller. We also get a fear amount of shocking and horrid pictures that's building up under the creepy feeling of the film. David Fincher has done a great job with this film, but Howard Shore's haunting score should also be mentioned, and off course Andrew Kevin Walker's brilliant script and story, which is very solid through out the whole film. Numerous of people have hailed Fincher's Fight Club (1999) and M.Night Shyamalan's The 6th Sense (1999) as two films with the best and most ingenious endings ever. Well, those people sure haven't seen Se7en....THIS film has a surprising and ingenious ending. I love every scene during the ending part of this film (You're no messiah! You're a movie of the week! You're a f**kin' T-Shirt, at best!). I've seen Se7en two times, with a gap of about one year. I remembered much of the film the second time I watched it, still I was totally surprised and stunned when the film came to the ending. This part is classic cinema at it's best.With a great story like this you need some good actors to bring the characters to life, and Se7en doesn't disappoint at that point either. Morgan Freeman is good as usual, even though he, to me, seems like the same person as he plays in about every film I've seen him in the old, wise and confident man who got the answer to almost every question. Brad Pitt is also good in, what may be, the best performance I've ever seen by him. The same can be said for Gwyneth Paltrow (who plays David Mills' wife), even though I haven't seen many films with her. But the one who steals the show, in my opinion, is Kevin Spacey. His role and character is very surprising, and I don't want to spoil anything. Just wait until you get to see his character show up in the film...he's brilliant.Like I said before, Se7en is probably the best serial-killer movie I've ever seen.

It seems like everybody has nothing but great things to say about that film...just like The Matrix (1999) and The 6th Sense (1999) which came out the same year. They're all good films, but they have never grabbed me the same way as they've grabbed everybody else. Fight Club tries to hard to be something it never manages to become, in my opinion. But let's not get out of line. Let's talk about another film by David Fincher instead. Se7en....now THAT'S one special film.This is one of those films that I feel is best to watch, when knowing as little as possible about the plot, but I can keep it to a minimum William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and David Mills (Brad Pitt) are two detectives, an old veteran and a young newcomer, that's being hired for a murder-case. This turns out to be a case of a serial-killer, and the killer's victims is people committing one of the seven deadly sins Gluttony, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and wrath.Serial-killers, detectives, thrillers...crime-films like this are not the types I watch too often. So let's just say that Seven is not only one of the few that I like, but probably the best film I've seen in it's genre (I don't remember much from the one time I saw Jonathan Demme's classic The Silence Of The Lambs (1991) many years ago). It's dark, stylish, well-made and very thrilling. And if David Fincher should be labeled a movie-genius (something that many of my friends thinks), then Se7en should be labeled his masterpiece, I think.The most brilliant part of the film hits you right from the beginning of....the mood. This film creates a dark and dusky mood that fits the plot and setting perfect, and creeps up under your skin and glues you to the screen. Techniqually and visually, this film is overwhelming and offers everything I expect from a thriller. We also get a fear amount of shocking and horrid pictures that's building up under the creepy feeling of the film. David Fincher has done a great job with this film, but Howard Shore's haunting score should also be mentioned, and off course Andrew Kevin Walker's brilliant script and story, which is very solid through out the whole film. Numerous of people have hailed Fincher's Fight Club (1999) and M.Night Shyamalan's The 6th Sense (1999) as two films with the best and most ingenious endings ever. Well, those people sure haven't seen Se7en....THIS film has a surprising and ingenious ending. I love every scene during the ending part of this film (You're no messiah! You're a movie of the week! You're a f**kin' T-Shirt, at best!). I've seen Se7en two times, with a gap of about one year. I remembered much of the film the second time I watched it, still I was totally surprised and stunned when the film came to the ending. This part is classic cinema at it's best.With a great story like this you need some good actors to bring the characters to life, and Se7en doesn't disappoint at that point either. Morgan Freeman is good as usual, even though he, to me, seems like the same person as he plays in about every film I've seen him in the old, wise and confident man who got the answer to almost every question. Brad Pitt is also good in, what may be, the best performance I've ever seen by him. The same can be said for Gwyneth Paltrow (who plays David Mills' wife), even though I haven't seen many films with her. But the one who steals the show, in my opinion, is Kevin Spacey. His role and character is very surprising, and I don't want to spoil anything. Just wait until you get to see his character show up in the film...he's brilliant.Like I said before, Se7en is probably the best serial-killer movie I've ever seen.

Of course, both Alien and Aliens are perfect 10s, while Alien 3 deviates from the course of excellence. It had many problems, chief of which was the way it continued and yet did not continue from the previous film. If Hollywood wants to do a continuation, they should do a continuation, instead of making a movie that really stands alone, but has a misplaced reference to continuity between the two movies ungracefully inserted. That's a very inconsistent, half-assed and frankly shitty way to present a movie to devoted audiences.However, I did watch Alien 3 several times up through the last 12 years, and seemed to like it better and better each time. I was starting to convince - I mean fool - myself that it was a wholesome stylistic exercise and experience.Then the Director's Cut came out. A friend of mine characterizes it as different, but not better or worse. Just different. We have a longer and infinitely more well-rounded story, with a completely different opening (Ripley having been flung out of the EEV, and the chest-burster having infected an ox - not a dog), and much, much bigger roles for the inmates at the penal colony. Finally, there is a reason for the story to be set in a prison. And there's much more human drama, and it's quite well-made.But. There's a big but. It is stylistically well done, but it just doesn't work very well. It's not a terribly interesting story.

This means that I'm completely discounting the horribly butchered version I saw on Bravo (for shame!) a year or so ago. They didn't just bleep out the expletives as you would expect, whole scenes were cut, leaving the work so diluted I almost forgot why I had loved it. It was like Jaws without teeth!Revisiting books, films or any work of art first experienced in youth can be very interesting, and I found that watching The Last Detail through my now (# unspecified!) year-old eyes was one of the many times something turned out to be even better the second time around. I guess that makes it a classic. For those that don't know, this is the story of two career enlisted Navy men who are assigned the dreary detail of delivering a young seaman to prison in Portsmouth, NH, where he will serve an eight year sentence for attempting to swipe $40 from their commanding officer's wife's favorite charity box. It's obvious that poor Meadows, played by Randy Quaid, has been thrown to the dogs for his offense, receiving a dishonorable discharge from the service in addition to the excessive prison term, but this is the Navy and our boys must do as ordered. It's a sh*t detail, but it will take them out of their insulated and listless existence on base in transition - that is, waiting for assignment to sea duty - and they quickly formulate a plan to relieve themselves of their charge as fast as possible and spend the bulk of the allotted time and money remaining to party the way good sailors do, namely drinking and whoring. Enter young Meadows, and the master plan takes on a life of its own as the seemingly hardened Bad Ass Buddusky (Jack Nicholson) and Mule Mulhall (Otis Young) find themselves caught up in Naval-infused fraternity with the childlike Meadows. Resigned to his fate, the hapless swabbie's frustrating passivity is fuel to Baddusky's pugnacious nature, and Mulhall and Meadows are swept along with Chief Signalman Bad Ass on a journey of discovery. From teaching him how to get his hamburger served the way he likes it (with the cheese MELTED, thank you very much), to facilitating the loss of his virginity (Carol Kane is perfect as the young prostitute), this is really a buddy movie at its finest. In the final frames, we watch the two lifers stroll out of the shot in lock-step, Anchors Aweigh piping, as they're off to reestablish themselves as individuals for a brief moment before returning to the shelter of their sacred family that is the US Navy.There's nothing sappy about this film, don't get me wrong. There's a definite hard edge to it and life as a Naval enlisted man is not romanticized in any way. Visually, it's quite somber from our side of the screen, and the military music in the score is to music, as the military justice in the story is to justice. There are some fabulously funny moments, and of course, Nicholson kills in this part that no one could have played better. Otis Young is really good as the cooler head who doesn't want to get himself jammed up in any way but who is none the less down with showing Meadows a good time. It's Randy Quaid though, who impressed me most on this viewing.

I guess that makes it a classic. For those that don't know, this is the story of two career enlisted Navy men who are assigned the dreary detail of delivering a young seaman to prison in Portsmouth, NH, where he will serve an eight year sentence for attempting to swipe $40 from their commanding officer's wife's favorite charity box. It's obvious that poor Meadows, played by Randy Quaid, has been thrown to the dogs for his offense, receiving a dishonorable discharge from the service in addition to the excessive prison term, but this is the Navy and our boys must do as ordered. It's a sh*t detail, but it will take them out of their insulated and listless existence on base in transition - that is, waiting for assignment to sea duty - and they quickly formulate a plan to relieve themselves of their charge as fast as possible and spend the bulk of the allotted time and money remaining to party the way good sailors do, namely drinking and whoring. Enter young Meadows, and the master plan takes on a life of its own as the seemingly hardened Bad Ass Buddusky (Jack Nicholson) and Mule Mulhall (Otis Young) find themselves caught up in Naval-infused fraternity with the childlike Meadows. Resigned to his fate, the hapless swabbie's frustrating passivity is fuel to Baddusky's pugnacious nature, and Mulhall and Meadows are swept along with Chief Signalman Bad Ass on a journey of discovery. From teaching him how to get his hamburger served the way he likes it (with the cheese MELTED, thank you very much), to facilitating the loss of his virginity (Carol Kane is perfect as the young prostitute), this is really a buddy movie at its finest. In the final frames, we watch the two lifers stroll out of the shot in lock-step, Anchors Aweigh piping, as they're off to reestablish themselves as individuals for a brief moment before returning to the shelter of their sacred family that is the US Navy.There's nothing sappy about this film, don't get me wrong. There's a definite hard edge to it and life as a Naval enlisted man is not romanticized in any way. Visually, it's quite somber from our side of the screen, and the military music in the score is to music, as the military justice in the story is to justice. There are some fabulously funny moments, and of course, Nicholson kills in this part that no one could have played better. Otis Young is really good as the cooler head who doesn't want to get himself jammed up in any way but who is none the less down with showing Meadows a good time.

Believe me, without the extra scenes the original film is quite average. Fortunately, i saw the special edition first.A nuclear submarine is mysteriously sunk by unknown forces, provoking orders from a navy ship to a team of oil riggers to investigate the situation with the help of a group of Navy SEALs. A disastrous hurricane strikes, causing the rig to sink to the edge of a deep sea trench. What follows from here on in is a powerful insight into human nature and the strength of love surviving against the unknown in the abyss.WARNING Only people who have seen the movie read on.I'd heard about this film vaguely before i saw it from watching a special effects documentary from ILM, which contained some footage from the water tentacle scene. Ever since i saw that footage, this became one of my must see movies, mainly because i'm intrigued in the early stages of CGI. You can understand my joy then when it showed its special edition self on sky one about three years ago. I taped and watched it, and frankly i was disappointed. What seemed like a fantastically timed sci-fi thriller\/adventure up to the point after the tentacle, turned out to mainly be about human survival until the last half hour, where it went back to.....aliens? This was definitely the act that killed the movie for me, as i was expecting so much more than aliens. The point after the water tentacle really kicked the film into high gear for me. I was thinking, uh oh, they've upset something big, now all hell's gonna break loose. The film really was just too good to be true in the end.Then i watched it again. Now knowing exactly what the film was about, i took it for what it was and now consider it one of James Cameron's finest. I embraced the end sequences and was just captivated by the sheer thrill and terror of the character acting and storytelling that was really about human behaviour in times of peril and in the fear and wonder of the unknown, plus how true love between two really can bring down walls, other than the full on sci-fi action i expected. Standout moments include Michael Beihn and Ed Harris' dual, the submersible chase, the scouring of the submarine, Mary Elizabeth's first encounter with the ET's, Ed Harris' descent into the trench (great display of the love between his and Mary's character) and the part that the original sorely missed, the special edition's extended Ed Harris ET encounter at the end, which i won't ruin for people who haven't seen the SE, but see this version and you won't regret it. But really, the finest scene in the film for me was the water tentacle. Executed with just the right pace and length, it really was the most captivating piece of cinema I'd ever seen, the way the alien tried to communicate, the pitch perfect acting to reflect everyone's amazement and realisation as to what they were dealing with. Plus u have the added bonus of the flawless effects work by ILM even by todays standards that give the sequence that added awe that's surprisingly rare in most modern effects films, and is a testament to the visual effects Oscar to this film's name.This film was made during the period where ILM started to win most of their Oscars for their experimentation into CGI (late 1980's to early 90's), which really went into full flow in Jurassic Park. But The Abyss is where it really started, and and it's quite obvious the technology in this film was in development to be later used to astonishing effect in T2. In both films by Cameron, the effects never get in the way of the character development and story. In fact, they enhance them by making the experience that more life like and exciting.The Abyss could have been so much more than what it ended up becoming in my opinion, but for what it is, it's a beautiful thing that deserves recognition not mainly for it's special effects, but for its heart and powerful story and premise into human survival and love. The science fiction element is more of a side story but it adds an ever present suspense that is broken in the last half hour of the film, and is replaced by generic, but well designed elements that aren't as good as the rest of the film, but concluded it well none the less.

I won't tell you the plot details here, since you can check the plot higher up on the page.Bully has wonderful screen writing for the most part, nice direction, and the acting was all good, too. Nothing great, just good.The film is indeed based on a book, which is an account of a true story, and is very compelling.Now we get to the cons, almost every other scene features sex between Bijou Philips or Rachel Miner, or at least one of them nude, now this doesn't really irk me all, and the two of them (Bijou Phillips much more, though) are quite nice to look at. But after a point you think, wow, this is just gratuitous. How is this important to anything in any way? I also found it hard to sympathize with several of the terrorized kids but I don't think this is a bad thing. These kids were, for all intents and purposes, useless (I'm not talking about Nick Stahl) except maybe for Marty Pucchio, who coulduh been a contenduh...at surfing.Now, though, for Nick Stahl. This is the character I felt most sympathetic about, because sure, he may have been a bit of a bully, but it seemed to be because he couldn't get in touch with his feelings. He was afraid and yet at the same time intrigued by his sexual confusion which several teenagers go through. I know kids like this (except maybe about the homosexual feelings, because thats only my business if they tell me) and this poor kid needed counseling. However, this, for me made the pivotal scene, the climax, that more powerful. What was left after the climax though, still carried that power, because of the final song in the movie.

Almost everyone and everything has been moved into the new station. It should be an easy night - just direct all callers and visitors to the new precinct building. But a series of gang deaths will make this night anything but easy. The gang wants revenge and selects the almost abandoned precinct as their target. The gang members have taken a blood oath to die if they must, but someone's going to pay for killing members of their group. With two secretarial types and two death-row inmates, the Lieutenant must fight off the gang's siege on Precinct 13 if he is to survive the night.- Assault on Precinct 13 may start a little slow, but once the action starts, it's kick-ass action all the way. It's not a perfect movie by any means. For example, much of the acting and dialogue are near laughable. But, John Carpenter makes up for this with a gripping, suspenseful story that rarely lets up. Carpenter is able to build atmosphere and chemistry between the characters - things I find lacking in many newer movies. The shoot-outs as the gang members come in waves at the building are flawlessly choreographed. While some of the jokes don't work, many are laugh-out-loud funny.- While I've heard Carpenter say that Assault on Precinct 13 is his modern day Rio Bravo, I think the movie has much more in common with George Romero's Night of the Living Dead. The similarities are almost endless* Both movies have people trapped in a building. * The people in both movies are lead by a black man, something still rare in 1976. * The people are under attack by wave after wave of basically faceless hordes - be they zombie or gang member. * A character in both movies tries to make a getaway in a nearby vehicle - both with disastrous results. * Both movies feature a basically catatonic character that the others will protect for no real reason. * Both movies mix characters from different socioeconomic standings into a cohesive fighting force. * And so on.- While Assault on Precinct 13 may have its share of flaws, it's one helluva ride.

I was greatly pleased after seeing it. It was a very easy movie to watch; the dialog went smooth and fast, the clips of gangsta rap and mood of the music was spot-on, and the acting was as bombastic as the characters were written. Also the directing by Antoine Fuqua (Replacement Killers, Tears of the sun...after Training Day) couldn't have been more brilliant and full of visual changes for the audience.Basically, Ethan Hawke plays a new NARC on the beat. He doesn't know what to expect out of Denzel Washington's character except that he is his trainer and an experienced detective. Denzel meticulously plans his real-life curriculum for Hawke to learn, and since Denzel's character is known in the surrounding neighborhoods as a detective who cuts deals with potential rapists, murderers, and drug dealers, he pushes buttons all throughout the neighborhood, brandishing Hawke as his protegé. When Hawke continues to see shady deal after shady deal, he begins to suspect that Washington is up to something but cannot place what it is. It comes down to the end when Hawke must choose what he was taught in the ethics training of the other policemen or what Denzel's character allows him to get away with on the street.There is not enough praise to give the actors and actresses, including Eva Mendes as Washington's girlfriend stuck in the ghetto with her son. I'm not particularly fond of Ethan Hawke in the action roles (to me, he looks kind of fake and unbelievable), but in this movie, there seems to be plenty going on to forget this small mirage. And Denzel was spectacular; he had this character down pact. He loves playing the same types of roles, but this one was almost written for him because of the delivery and positioning that he displays every time the camera is on him.The Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre appearances didn't need to be there, but there's no doubt about the power of being the director's friends. Snoop was better than Dre, I think, mainly because he was given more of a character to portray (while placed in a wheelchair of all things for the most notable cool-cat in rapping business). But other than their puzzling cameos, the movie does great to entertain and keep you guessing every bit of the way.I gave it a 7\/10 because it doesn't have the look about a classic film and to constantly watch it, it would get tedious, but the feel and look of the whole thing keeps you entertained for a few watches. It's worth the buy, but rent it first to get a deeper story to see if it's your type of action\/cop drama movie.
