He is adopted by a loving man and his wacky wife. The laughs keep coming as the boy pushes them to the limits.Problem Child is one of the most unfunny and horrible movies ever to play on my television set. It's copies should be taken out and burned on a large public bonfire. Basically the movie tells the story of a man (played by John Ritter) and his gold-digging wife who adopt a kid named Junior, who is without a doubt the worst child ever to appear in front a movie camera. The two think that maybe they can reform this demon of a child, but throughout the course of the movie, he does one absolutely horrible thing right after another. It's people like Michael Oliver who give a bad name to child actors, seriously, only about ten minutes into the movie, I felt like I wanted to take a wrench and beat the kid to death with it, or even better, burn him with a flamethrower, slowly and painfully. Okay, maybe that sounds a little bit harsh, but really, if you watch this movie, and see just how obnoxious and bratty this kid is, you'll see what I'm getting at.Michael Richards (in a pre-Seinfeld role) plays Martin Beck, a serial killer, that Junior idolizes. What the f---? Idolizing a murderer? But then again, this is Junior that we're talking about, so it does make a little sense. Jack Warden is wasted in his role as Big Ben Healy, the father of John Ritter's character, who absolutely hates Junior. I was on Big Ben's side, and if I would have been in the movie, I probably would have gotten rid of Junior the very minute that I saw him. But as for who is the lowlight of this film? You guessed it, Michael Oliver, who plays Junior. Junior is even worse than Damien Thorn, believe me, when you see Junior and all of the bad things that he does, you will probably be wishing that you could warp yourself inside the television so that you could kick that stupid little brat right in the face, as he is such an obnoxious and smart-mouthed kid.All in all, Problem Child is bound to come up when you start talking about what you think would be among the worst movies that you have ever seen. Oh, and if you're wondering just what kind of trouble Junior causes, I'll tell you. Basically, he destroys trailers with a bulldozer, he beats up kids with a baseball bat while the adults just stand around and do nothing, he sets a room in fire, and he does much more. And like I said, he idolizes a serial killer. The only reason I watched this whole movie was to see that horrid kid get his comeuppance. But did he get his comeuppance? A resounding NO! He got away with all of it! Probably because we are supposed to feel sorry for him, because he's just misunderstood. He is not misunderstood. I understood that kid perfectly. He was a vile, obnoxious, arrogant, rotten, and spoiled little brat that deserved to be given a good thrashing, and a hard one at that.BOMB\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"10 June 2015","score":"","review":" A young boy is just short of a monster.

From what I understand Michael Crichton had no plans for a sequel but Steven Spielberg convince him to write a sequel.What we got was The Lost World. I remember in 1997 how fired up I was to learn we were going to get a sequel to Jurassic Park and I saw it twice in theaters with my family ended up getting a good percent of the toys from the film.Looking back on it I'm surprised the film wasn't given the R Rating considering how this is the most graphic film in the Trilogy and some of the scenes were too much for a PG-13 film. Despite the mix reviews I find it to be a good film sure it's not perfect it does have thrills and action like in the first film and some that are just wow and the only way to give it justice is to watch the film.The film plot this time centers around Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) who is asked by John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) to lead a research team onto Isla Sorna Site B the team being his girlfriend Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore), Nick Van Owen (Vince Vaughn) and Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff) and Ian's daughter Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester) who got to study how the Dinosaurs are surviving on the island all the while try and stop Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) as he leads a team of hunters lead by Roland Tembo (Pete Postlethwaite),Dieter Stark (Peter Stormare),Ajay Sidhu (Ajay Sidhu), Dr. Robert Burke (Thomas F. Duffy) Carter (Thomas Rosales Jr)Cameo Joseph Mazzello returns as Tim and Ariana Richards returns as Lex for the start of the film. Being that this film takes place four years after Jurassic Park this film had a lot to live up to. The reaction in the theaters back in 1997 was huge so it did something right to get movie fans to be in awe by the film. The film feature some of the most tense scenes ever in a movie with my personal favorite scene is when Ian, Nick and Sarah are hanging over the cliff in their trailers that scene will have your skin crawling and your nerves up high. And the effects for the dinosaurs are once again impressive as they used a mix of Puppet work and C.G.I. In this film you can feel that the Dinosaurs are meant for business each time they are screen you know something is about to happen. That what give the movie a edge when it comes to seeing how the characters react to the Dinosaurs in the film The music once again is amazing, John Williams music always tells a story and this film is no different each score he wrote for this film matches the story and plot each time you hear his music you can tell some love went into these score.The film also features good quotes like Predators don't hunt when they're not hungry and Taking dinosaurs off this island is the worst idea in the long sad history of bad ideas.The film is pretty dark as this often times feels like a horror film as the scenes can feel that way when you see the predators coming out of hiding you'll be able to understand where I'm coming fromFor the Dinosaurs we get Two Tyrannosaurus Rex one male one female as well as a young one, Compsognathus, Gallimimus,Mamenchisaurus Pachycephalosaurus,Edmontosaurus,Parasaurolophus,Pteranodon Stegosaurus,Triceratops and Velociraptor.

Jeff Goldblum was great as a supporting character in the first Jurassic park but, here he just doesn't work as a lead character and he doesn't anything he's just there to speak dialogue so that they can be in the movie trailers and he doesn't get to kill dinosaurs with rocket launcher or machine guns. Some of the good things i will say is Richard Attenborough for little role he had in this film is still good as John Hammed. There are quite some good cinematography by Janusz Kaminski. good music by John Williams. One more thing i will write is the whole third act of the film is when Spielberg just gave up on this film, it becomes a completely different film, the tone gets wired i can't describe it, some characters are missing in the third act, John Hammond doesn't care when his nephew peter(main antagonist) gets eaten by a baby T-Rex. The lost world Jurassic park is one of Spielberg's worst movies in my opinion.

They don't see each other. They only see what they want to see. They don't know they're dead.When asked what my favorite films are, M. Night Shyamalan's psychological thriller The Sixth Sense tops the list for me every time. I know he hasn't been on a role lately, but that doesn't stop me from having high expectations for any of his upcoming projects because I was deeply influenced by this film. Even his following movies, Unbreakable and Signs, rank among my favorites, and I went as far as defending his work in The Happening (which is a guilty pleasure of mine). His latest films have disappointed me, but I still admire his storytelling and the way he builds suspense in his films (he's heavily influenced by another favorite director of mine Alfred Hitchcock). I'm looking forward to the release of his new TV series, Wayward Pines, which seems like a return to form for this talented director. But I'm even more excited about his upcoming film, The Visit, which will be released in September. I was 18 when this film came out and I had just passed my final High School exam so I decided to treat myself to the movies that night to celebrate. Up to this point I was simply a casual viewer of movies and enjoyed pretty much everything I saw. I had no idea about film criticism, and when I got to the theater I decided on The Sixth Sense simply because it starred Bruce Willis. I didn't know anything else about the film and was surprised it wasn't another action vehicle from Willis. The film had a very slow and creepy opening, but I was sucked in by the story and the building atmosphere. I was enjoying the strong chemistry between Willis and Haley Joel Osment as the pair were trying to figure out what was causing these freaky visions. There were several surprisingly scary scenes that made me jump out of my seat a couple of times. The score was deeply effective as well. I was hooked from the very opening scene, but I was not at all prepared for the surprising and revealing twist at the end that left me completely blown away and speechless in the theater as the credits began rolling. I was in love with The Sixth Sense and from that moment on I have not stopped praising it. I can't believe all the signs that Shyamalan leaves behind for the audience while he is telling the story, and we still couldn't see the twist coming. He practically has Osment spell it out in his famous scene with Willis. It was a movie I had to rewatch simply because of that twist, and the second viewing allowed me to appreciate the film even more by catching up on all the symbolisms and clues that the director left behind. In my opinion it is the best twist ever because you never feel cheated by it. I credit this movie for getting me interested in film as an art form, although the transition didn't happen from one moment to the next. The performances from Willis, Olivia Williams, and Toni Collette are all great, but Osment stood out, and it remains one of the best child performances I've seen from a Hollywood film.

It obviously wasn't Goyer's strong suit back then, because in the opening scene, we find out who Van Damme's character is, where he came from, why he's there, and that he isn't a guy who plays by the rules--in three lines of some of the most forced dialogue I've heard in quite a while. Expository dialogue is everywhere in this movie. They even explain the twist and the motivations behind it.The generic music sucks at setting the right tone, sucks at building suspense, and even sucks at being generic.

I must've been about fourteen or fifteen years old and decided to watch it when it was on late at night of a weekend. I remember being compelled by the first 40 minutes (although finding it slightly repetitive) and finding the rest of it completely boring and aimless. Fast forward five years later to present day and you'll find me currently going through the whole of Stanley Kubrick's filmography and sticking on Full Metal Jacket for a second time. Have my opinions changed? Yes they have.I no longer find the first 40 minutes repetitive. In fact, I think the first 40 minutes of Full Metal Jacket is one of the best things Stanley has ever created. The first 40 minutes are so strong that the rest of the film is unfortunately left in its shadow, but more on that in a bit. This half perfectly illustrates the conversion of human beings into cold, emotionless killers. Right from the off the recruits are stripped of their names and instead given labels. They're all made to have the same hairstyle (or lack of), same clothes and shout only when shouted to. All of them even act like robots when training in unison. All except Private Pyle.The story of Private Pyle's descent into madness is one of the most memorable put on film. At first we find his physical and mental inabilities amusing with the electrifying Lee Ermey shouting hilarious insults at him and Pyle failing miserably at obstacle courses. However, as it progresses the constant bullying becomes incredibly disturbing. There's a fantastically dark moment where all the private's team together to beat Pyle late at night with some soap. In the end you can't help but feel sympathy for him.It all accumulates to the most powerful moment in the film where Pyle goes totally insane in the toilet. Everything in this scene is flawless. The brooding music, Vincent D'Onofrio's haunting performance, the lighting, and the directing. All of this makes for an incredibly atmospheric and frightening scene with a chilling pay-off which is both surprising and unforgettable. The trouble is, how can you follow this scene? The answer is, you can't. So far the centre of the film has been the relationship between Vincent D'Onofrio and R Lee Ermey, thus with these characters gone a new film begins.We're plunged without warning into Vietnam, however unlike my fifteen year-old self, I actually didn't find these parts boring. I just get frustrated because I'm not entirely sure what Stanley is trying to say. We sort of get little snapshots of life in Vietnam with Private Joker bobbing about and meeting folk. The film doesn't really go anywhere, yet it still remains largely interesting, just nowhere near as interesting as the mesmerising first half. I did like the prostitute encounters though and thought they had a lot of interesting things to say about humanity.The film suddenly gets really good again when the team encounter a sniper. For Stanley Kubrick, it's actually a fairly conventional war scene, albeit brilliantly done. It's full of tension, remains gripping and feels very real. It's incredible to think that the whole Vietnam sequences were filmed in London! Stanley then turns to his unusual self when the group encounter who the sniper is. It's a very uncomfortable and haunting moment which results in the famous Mickey Mouse chant at the very end.I'm not entirely sure what Full Metal Jacket is trying to say, but I'm sure that Stanley has popped in a load of horrendously clever hidden metaphors which still haven't fully been worked out yet. The whole film is of course a visual feast with superb directing from Stanley. However, content-wise I don't think it's as strong as his previous Paths of Glory. Full Metal Jacket may be much better in the technical department, but it feels uneven. Joker is nowhere near as interesting as Pyle and so the film begins to sag in comparison. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the film farm more than when I first layed eyes upon it and will certainly be giving it some more watches!

In the end you can't help but feel sympathy for him.It all accumulates to the most powerful moment in the film where Pyle goes totally insane in the toilet. Everything in this scene is flawless. The brooding music, Vincent D'Onofrio's haunting performance, the lighting, and the directing. All of this makes for an incredibly atmospheric and frightening scene with a chilling pay-off which is both surprising and unforgettable. The trouble is, how can you follow this scene? The answer is, you can't. So far the centre of the film has been the relationship between Vincent D'Onofrio and R Lee Ermey, thus with these characters gone a new film begins.We're plunged without warning into Vietnam, however unlike my fifteen year-old self, I actually didn't find these parts boring. I just get frustrated because I'm not entirely sure what Stanley is trying to say. We sort of get little snapshots of life in Vietnam with Private Joker bobbing about and meeting folk. The film doesn't really go anywhere, yet it still remains largely interesting, just nowhere near as interesting as the mesmerising first half. I did like the prostitute encounters though and thought they had a lot of interesting things to say about humanity.The film suddenly gets really good again when the team encounter a sniper. For Stanley Kubrick, it's actually a fairly conventional war scene, albeit brilliantly done. It's full of tension, remains gripping and feels very real. It's incredible to think that the whole Vietnam sequences were filmed in London! Stanley then turns to his unusual self when the group encounter who the sniper is. It's a very uncomfortable and haunting moment which results in the famous Mickey Mouse chant at the very end.I'm not entirely sure what Full Metal Jacket is trying to say, but I'm sure that Stanley has popped in a load of horrendously clever hidden metaphors which still haven't fully been worked out yet. The whole film is of course a visual feast with superb directing from Stanley. However, content-wise I don't think it's as strong as his previous Paths of Glory. Full Metal Jacket may be much better in the technical department, but it feels uneven. Joker is nowhere near as interesting as Pyle and so the film begins to sag in comparison. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the film farm more than when I first layed eyes upon it and will certainly be giving it some more watches!

I must've been about fourteen or fifteen years old and decided to watch it when it was on late at night of a weekend. I remember being compelled by the first 40 minutes (although finding it slightly repetitive) and finding the rest of it completely boring and aimless. Fast forward five years later to present day and you'll find me currently going through the whole of Stanley Kubrick's filmography and sticking on Full Metal Jacket for a second time. Have my opinions changed? Yes they have.I no longer find the first 40 minutes repetitive. In fact, I think the first 40 minutes of Full Metal Jacket is one of the best things Stanley has ever created. The first 40 minutes are so strong that the rest of the film is unfortunately left in its shadow, but more on that in a bit. This half perfectly illustrates the conversion of human beings into cold, emotionless killers. Right from the off the recruits are stripped of their names and instead given labels. They're all made to have the same hairstyle (or lack of), same clothes and shout only when shouted to. All of them even act like robots when training in unison. All except Private Pyle.The story of Private Pyle's descent into madness is one of the most memorable put on film.

And I will give the movie a lot of credit because of the amazing atmosphere it creates. Dario Argento achieves this through an incredible combination of unusual lighting and disturbing music (that is really catchy by the way) and it draws the viewer into the movie and makes it a very interesting visual experience. However, the movie does suffer from many things that downgrade the experience for me. I am talking about the incoherent story, the dumb dialogue and the stuff that happens that makes no sense whatsoever. Like in the beginning of the movie when the first girl dies, she looks out the window and sees some cat-like eyes and someone starts strangling her, apparently flying or something cause her window wasn't in the first floor. Also a major problem is that some of the situations the characters get in are very poorly developed. I will say the dancers are pretty hot, though. Many plot points that I believe needed to be explained in the end, weren't, like who exactly killed everyone? And how did they possess the dog to kill the blind dude? I know it is kind of implied but I think they should have done a better job at developing these ideas.In the end I thought Suspiria had an amazing theme and very well done lighting that created a creepy atmosphere throughout, but because of the stupid, unreasonable dialogue and incoherent storytelling, Suspiria is barely a satisfying experience.

One of the pleasant things about the Jurassic Park franchise is that dinosaur films are few and far between, which allows for the ideas and sequences in these films to remain mostly fresh. There's little interference with been there, done that responses to action setpieces, nor is there a general cynicism to the tones of these films or the imagery (which gets especially moodier in this film). The wonder and elements of peril are still firmly instilled in Spielberg's direction and David Koepp's screenplay, making for a film that continues to really emphasize the thrill of its predecessor through nearly every scene.We focus on Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), who is hired by InGen CEO John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) to document the activities of the dinosaurs on Hammond's second Jurassic Park site after the terrible breakdown of his first site before financiers close the second park. Initially apprehensive, Malcolm turns compliant when he sees his paleontologist girlfriend Sarah (Julianne Moore) packed up and ready to go, in addition to his daughter Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester) from his first marriage. On the trip, Malcolm winds up meeting an ecological film crew run by Vince Vaughn's Nick as well as a famous hunter known as Roland Tembo (Pete Postlethwaite). As expected, however, the same catastrophe that occurred in the first park repeats itself with the second, making for a frightening and dangerous experience for the long-suffering individuals who recall Jurassic Park's initial failure all too well.The sole thing The Lost World does better than its predecessor is give us a group of more interesting characters and character actors. Seeing Goldblum, Moore, and Vaughn work off one another in a way that channels misfit tendencies very nicely is something to relish, for seeing all these actors in such a goofy, fun-loving project makes the price of admission already worth it. This band of characters, while still not entirely fleshed out, is still a lot better than the marginally amusing cast of characters from the first movie, which benefited largely from the effortless charisma of the everyman Wayne Knight.Still instilled in The Lost World from the original Jurassic Park film is the film's desire to keep us feeling constant danger and uncertainty. Jurassic Park's main attraction, besides state-of-the-art special effects, was the fact that it always made us feel at the mercy of enormous, hulking dinosaurs, regardless of where we tried to hide (or where the camera place us). Spielberg clearly capitalizes on this principle with this particular film, giving us the feeling of minimal safety he did with not only this film's predecessor, but his other projects like Duel and Poltergeist.Then there's the element of darkness in this film that's significantly more present here than it was in the first film. Rather than encapsulating the common attributes of flashy, summer blockbusters, The Lost World finds itself assuming a moodier state of mind, actively showing innocent bystanders consumed by dinosaurs, young people mauled by baby dinosaurs, and more. There's a flood of action and suspenseful sequences that really amount to some fully realized events in this film. Consider the scene when Kelly performs a complex gymnastics routine to save Malcolm and Sarah, or when the dinosaurs are attacking the film crew and Malcolm works to rescue them.In some ways, The Lost World finds ways to be more engaging than Jurassic Park. Its moodier style further exploits the dangers of dinosaurs, and the repeated peril that humans face when trying to assimilate to their world. The Lost World Jurassic Park continues to affirm this frightening realization while remaining a thrilling piece of blockbuster entertainment, never squandering the opportunity to be dark and violent but also peppering in the occasional one-liner (some funny, some cringe-worthy) for good measure. Much like its predecessor, this is ultimately a variation on the summer blockbuster done well and in a consistently enjoyable manner.Starring Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, Vanessa Lee Chester, Vince Vaughn, Pete Postlethwaite, and Richard Attenborough.

It starts out as a good smuggling story, which turns out to be a plot leading to economic chaos in the west. The movie consists of two halves of unequal quality, where the first one is superior. A somewhat disappointing point about the inferior second half is the fact that Bond is captured for basically the whole time (which is, mind you, half of the total screen time), merely acting as a spectator to Goldfinger's actions.Goldfinger is also the first entry in the series to feature the now famous Bond formula in its fully fledged form. Consisting of more action and humor than its two predecessors, GF is moving more towards the popcorn movie camp than the earlier Thriller styled films. Also introduced is Bond's classic car - The Aston Martin DB5, with modifications, as well as Q's customary irritated attitude towards Bond. In contrast to direct precursor From Russia With Love, where the only gadget Bond was given was a special briefcase containing a rifle and a knife, Goldfinger includes more advanced gadgets, and in higher quantity.Sean Connery is solid as always in a very relaxed and charming performance, but at the same time I think it's fair to add that he lacks some of the rough edge from before. Still, this is the movie where the amusing cinematic Bond character really comes to life for the first time.Overall, the acting among the supporting cast is professional, and the soundtrack is solid. Auric Goldfinger is a good and classic villain, while his henchman Oddjob is among the best of the series. Honor Blackman, serving as Bond's love interest, is not only attractive but also visibly more experienced in acting than former Bond girls.As with the other Bond movies of the 1960's, there are obvious, clumsy mistakes, such as visible dubbing and fast forwarding. Another mistake occurs when the atomic bomb inside Fort Knox is stopped seven seconds before going off and Bond subsequently quips three more clicks and Mr. Goldfinger would have hit the jackpot. Also, on the plane in the end, a Chinese guard is unintentionally visible a couple of times (he was unsuccessfully edited out of the final fight between Bond and Goldfinger).All in all, the first half is very good, as mentioned. The locations, primarily the golf course and Switzerland, are pleasing. Unfortunately, I find the part set in America (second half), where Bond is constantly in Goldfinger's leash, less pleasing, save the climax at Fort Knox. Still an enjoyable Bond classic overall.

How come this scene has been kept in the final editing? Nobody knows but Allen himself. From this angle, it actually bespeaks the half-hearted style of the movie and declares don't take me too seriously please!. In retrospect SLEEPER doesn't stand out among Allen's works, but indeed it is the watershed in his career since afterward (from LOVE & DEATH, 1975) his films has matured into a realm with a more sophisticated and judicious calibre about urbanite relationship philosophy which modern viewers are more familiar with, other than his earlier light-hearted and sex-obsessed farces launch his long-lasting career. Also simply the idea of Woody Allen directs a Sci-fi movie alone sounds inviting enough for me.Woody Allen is Miles Monroe, a store owner and divorcée in 1973, being revived out of cryostasis after 200 years, where autocracy has dumbed down human's intelligence. When he is on the lam as an alien wanted by the government, he meets Luna Schlosser, a well- behaved citizen, a self-claimed poet with a degree in oral sex, Miles falls for her, and together, they will eventually sabotage a final attempt of cloning the dictator from his nose, the last remnant of his body. Although only possessing a shoestring budget, Allen constructs the future-world with a strong influence of futurism, although the settings look chintzy in sight by today's standards, the film does stick with its wack-a-doodle mockery right from Monroe is awaken from his aluminum wrap, with many homages and references to past screen classics, theatrical pieces and slapstick burlesques. Sex is the unalterable wont in Allen's mindset, as he emphasises in the coda, sex and death are the only things he believes in. The most ridiculous props are the pleasure orb and the sex booth where two people can achieve orgasm in 10 seconds, Monroe has tried once, not with Luna, but with himself. The quarrelsome mode of Allen and Keaton forms a nice congruity which would later stride on to perfection in ANNIE HALL (1977, 9\/10). Escorting the screwball plot is the ragtime score composed by Allen himself, a suitable company as Miles is an amateur musician in a jazz band too, altogether SLEEPER is definitely undemanding in viewers' brainpower to grasp its mockery of superficiality and social politics, but an insouciant cruise in a meaningless fiction, sometimes one might feel too silly to be keen on what is materialising on the screen, unfortunately that is not a sign of a great film in my book.
