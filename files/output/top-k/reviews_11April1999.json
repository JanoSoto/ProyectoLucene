I guess this was supposed to be a sort of character study, but the characters were never developed, seemed one dimensional, were uninteresting, and worst of all, could not act.I like Charles Dutton, but he is more suited to television.  Liv Tyler is cute, but needs to stay off the screen, or at least not be given so many lines.All in all, this is the only film I can remember seeing that actually made me angry at the filmmakers.  However, the other members of the audience seemed to like it, so maybe it's just me!
