The house should be creepy not beautiful. I guess in one sense it was kind of creepy, but it definitely could have been terrifying, even to watch, let alone if you had the chance to be put in that house yourself for a few nights. I also thought that the visual effects supervisors of the film shouldn't have used cartoon type child ghosts in it. That was just terrible. If they made the ghosts look even remotely human I might have been a little creeped out if that was what I saw swimming through the sheets of Lily Taylor's bed instead of a cartoonish type ghost. Another thing, the director (Jan de Bont) shouldn't have been afraid of getting an R-rating, which was what the MPAA was going to give them for the films' intense horror sequences. But, Jan de Bont went back and toned the film down to get that PG-13 rating which was a terrible mistake. If he decided to go for the R-rating and not care about the MPAA, The Haunting might have been a *really* good movie and scary at that matter. The ending was quite a disappointment to say the least and I even read in Entertainment Weekly that Dreamworks, the production and distribution company, was terrified of the first ending...so why did they go back and redo it?

It' difficult to believe that Kevin Williamson had the gall to follow up the sly, smart `Scream' with this rancid garbage.  `I Know What You Did Last Summer' is a prime example of bad filmmaking from start to finish.  Essentially, it's a big budget version of `Friday the 13th, Part 5', except even the films in the `Friday the 13th' films had better acting and better scripts.  Whatever marketing executives touted this awful film as a `follow-up to Scream' should be flogged for their lies. `I Know What You Did Last Summer' is the allegedly horrifying tale of four stereotypical high school friends  Barry (Ryan Phillippe), the rich jock; Helen (Sarah Michelle Geller), the popular cheerleader; Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt), the brain; and Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.), the loner.  On one fateful Fourth of July, they accidentally hit a stranger on the road, killing him.  Instead of reporting the accident like normal, responsible people, they dump the stranger's body in the ocean and vow never to speak of the night again.  A year later, when all four characters are still wracked with guilt over the horrible thing they've done, Julie suddenly receives a strange note -- yes, it's the ominous `I Know What You Did Last Summer'.  People around Julie start dropping like flies, dying at the hands of a murderer who dresses suspiciously like the Gorton's Fisherman.  Gratuitous blood and carnage ensues.If the film had any sensibility -- in other words, if it had even vaguely been like `Scream' -- it might've been fun, if not great.  However, the only similarity between the two films is its use of teen TV stars from Fox and the WB.  `Scream' was able to play with the typical slasher film conventions in new and original ways; `I Know What You Did Last Summer' clutches at those conventions like they're religious dogma.  There's no suspense or terror in the film.  Characters wander alone into dark alleys and they die.  Characters mouth dumb dialogue ripped straight out of `Nightmare on Elm Street, Part Two' and `Halloween 4'.  Lights go out at the most inconvenient times.  Yawn.  It's been done before, and done much better, by nearly a dozen other slasher films.  I give two of the actors credit for trying -- Ryan Phillippe makes the most of his paper-thin character Barry, and Sarah Michelle Gellar's actually pretty good as the disillusioned Helen -- but their performances aren't nearly enough to save the film.  The other two simply aren't very good.  As Julie, Jennifer Love Hewitt doesn't do much except to ask stupid questions and to look helpless; and Freddie Prinze Jr. is about as lively as a store mannequin as Ray, the troubled loner.  (Side note  who keeps casting Freddie Prinze Jr. in movies, anyway?  It's scary how consistently the guy keeps churning out flat, wooden performances.)  So, the performance of the four leads essentially even out to add nothing to the film's script . . . and since the script is an unoriginal mess, there's almost nothing good to say about the movie.  (The one original and genuinely funny line spoken in the entire movie is said by Sarah Michelle Gellar -- she makes a reference to `Silence of the Lambs' that's terrific, and also completely out of place with the rest of the insipid nonsense being spoken throughout the film.)Looking for a great, traditional slasher film?  Rent the original `Halloween'.  Looking for a great, modern slasher film? Rent the original `Scream'.  Looking for a rotten, boring, completely uninspired slasher film?

This is not to say, however, that the film isparticularly good. There is a technical shoddiness to the entireenterprise - long, under-rehearsed and unedited takes with endlesspanning and zooming - that undercuts whatever its creator, John Waters,may have wanted to say about the corrupt society he so clearly loves tohate (just compare the quality of Waters' own footage with thedocumentary footage shot by Steve Yeager in his award-winning DIVINETRASH, of John Waters actually at work filming PINK FLAMINGOS for allthe evidence you need of the director's lack of cinematographic skill).It's not that Waters lacks the ability to articulate his point of view;it's just that his directorial abilities tend to fall short of histhematic ambitions. You see, I am of the opinion that Waters' greatestgift is in the writing department. Directorially, his films show littlein the way of rhythm and focus. That is, perhaps, with perhaps one clearexception.DESPERATE LIVING is a genuinely Felliniesque epic with, at least in myview, far more scope than any of Waters' other work. In it, he createsan entire parallel universe, Morteville, where compulsory misery isenforced by legal decree. The principle cast is enormous and there justseems to be so much more going on than in anything else Waters has everdone.

Gays complain about the stereotyping, I personally could recognize every single one of the characters in people I've known through the years and people I see on the streets all the time act like that, call themselves bitches and do appear to have a certain need to act effeminate while in each other's company. To me, it was a very keen portrayal of how lots of gay groups interact specially in big cities(not only West Hollywood, this could be London, Madrid or Buenos Aires).  Instead of complaining about how bad this looks, all of the members of gay communities (I'm talking about places where there are large concentrations of gays and we all know what I mean) should be trying to expand what the community means and offers and not nurture those stereotypes that are so blatantly exposed in films(and of course sometimes exploited).We could obviously transfer the group of friends into a heterosexual lecture and we'll end up with the same conclusion. This group of gay friends do behave extremely gay and they accept it and some of them even mourn it. Straight groups that act extremely straight(say for example groups of high school cheerleaders or football players) or any group for that matter that asks you to follow a certain pattern of behaviour up to the dangers of depersonalization(think Philosophy students) can only be bad to your mental health and will leave you astray in a world where you are either strong, authentic and in touch with yourself or you'll end up(again) trying to hang on to a group of people for security and acceptance. This film is certainly about that, not about what it feels like to be gay regardless of your geographic situation(you should see Fucking Amal for that). But the director has taken the chance to comprise every aspect of the gay society and make a statement about it in a witty way.He obviously feels strongly about many issues and he's obviously tired of it too.   But then he also relaxes a bit and indicates that it's not really what you do or don't do, it's why you do it. A good example; John Mahoney in drag telling this other guy that he doesn't care whatever statement he's supposed to be making by dressing in drag badly, with armpits unshaved and a dreadful wig; he does it because it is great fun to him and his audience.

The film, for the most part, features just two characters on a thirty-foot boat . . . but the boat's not ordinary, and neither are the characters.  Katherine Hepburn gives one of her greatest performances ever as missionary Rose Sayer, and Humphrey Bogart puts in THE best performance of his career as the grungy, affable captain of the `African Queen', Charlie Allnut.The plot is fairly simple -- it's 1914, and Allnut is a riverboat captain in Africa, bringing mail and other sundries from one port to another.  One of the places he brings mail to is a missionary led by the British reverend Samuel Sayer (Robert Morley) and his sister Rose.   With the outbreak of World War I, German troops overrun the missionary -- Samuel dies, and Allnut manages to spirit Rose away to safety.  Allnut finds himself challenged, though, when Rose concocts a plan -- not to flee from the Germans, but to attack the German ship `Louisa', which controls the African rivers.The story is more about the relationship between Rose and Allnut than about the journey of the `African Queen' itself -- where these two characters travel emotionally is far more important than where they go physically.  Allnut starts out as a world-weary traveler, content with his comfortable life of piloting his boat and drinking his gin.  It takes meeting someone like Rose to make him realize that there might be more wonderful things in his life that he might be missing.  In a similar way, Rose is an extremely sheltered woman, committed to the missionary and to her brother; when those things are stripped away from her, she is forced to see what else the world might hold for her.  The story moves nicely between comedy and drama as well -- there's a funny scene early on where Allnut has some embarrassingly loud gas, but in the very next scene, he's trying hard to offer comfort to Rose, even though he can't find the words to offer that comfort.  Hepburn is brilliant as Rose, struggling to maintain her dignity even though she's an emotional whirlwind, and Bogart . . . man, Bogart's simply the best.  He's incredibly funny, he's deadly serious, and perhaps most importantly . . . he's polite.  It's a great touch how he always politely calls Rose `Miss' throughout the film, no matter how urgent or dangerous the situation, simply because he believes that Rose should be treated with respect.  Bogart's portrayal of Charlie Allnut won him an Oscar in 1951; and quite honestly, it might be one of the top ten performances ever captured on film.  Ever.Director John Ford does a great job with the film as well -- the shots of the `African Queen' going down the rapids are simply breathtaking, and an eerie (and somewhat repulsive) scene involving Allnut and some leeches is skillfully handled as well.  Equally impressive, though, is how Ford handles the scenes between Bogart and Hepburn are fantastic as well.  Many times, while one character speaks, Ford chooses to focus on the other character that's listening, capturing a small smile or the sagging of shoulders to let the audience know what that other character's reaction is without the use of dialogue.  There's easily a dozen or so small touches like this throughout `The African Queen' that set it slightly above other great films, and into the realm of the masterpiece.Enough rambling.  It's one of the best films ever made, without question.  Go watch it!!

Don't get me wrong, I love them all, but this one ultimately stands out as where the character Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) goes from a great fighter to a legend. This film is a tremendous kaleidoscope of action, drama and entertainment.If you have seen the previous Rocky films (which I recommend as well), you will remember Rocky's greatest rival Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), who is a brash and outlandish fighter who will remind you of a young Muhammad Ali. However, now since that they have earned each others friendship and respect, they are now on the same side against a common enemy Ivan Drago, the top amateur fighter from Russia. Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) is an impressive sight at nearly seven-feet in height. Apollo Creed is the first to get a crack at Drago, and is ultimately defeated to the point of death in the ring. Now the film gets serious. The film uses terrific music & video montages to show what Rocky is thinking.Either its friendship or patriotism combined with a little ego that forces Rocky to lay down a challenge as well. However he demands the fight to take place in Moscow, Russia on Christmas Day, using the most basic circumstances of training.To feel a little patriotic is an understatment as you see the differences and ethics in methods of training. Ivan Drago trains in the most comfortable gymnasiums and uses state-of-the-art equipment, as well as taking large doses of anabolic steroids. This is proven by his dramatic increases of power as he goes from 700 to over 2,000 pounds of pressure in ONE PUNCH! Rocky trains by running in the snow and up mountains, by chopping logs, lifting large sacks of rocks and pulling wagons. By the time of the fight, both men are in incredible condition, and the only thing that will prove victorious is who has the most heart and desire.You can't get much more influential elements to stroke the American ego than those included in this movie. Basically simple USA vs. RUSSIA on their own turf in a complete gutter war. Its the Clash Of The Super Powers during the last years of the bitter Cold War.

Keanu Reeves is brilliant is his turn as a villian- and so is Spader as the detective and Tomei as the innocent therapist. This movie is very exciting and hip and in style- a movie which all 21th century films should now become like. This movie did not hold any 90s crap in the past with horror flicks like I Know What You Did Last Summer or Scream- it holds its own plot and sticks with it. The music downplays the eerie feeling of a strangler and serial killer- it has it all. But the only problem is the short running time of 96 minutes- it easily could've been longer and better- but this movie was for a 'now' basis anyway.Out of four stars- I give it a 3.
