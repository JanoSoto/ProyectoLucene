[{"date":"1 January 2016","score":"","review":" Nobody who was at Ground Zero in Manhattan, or saw the horror unfolding on live television, can ever forget what happened on September 11, 2001. And in 2015, we saw sizable terror attacks of a decidedly different nature take place some ten thousand miles apart, first in three simultaneous attacks in Paris, and then on a rehabilitation center in San Bernardino, California, just sixty miles east of Los Angeles.But a film released slightly less than three years before the horror of 9\/11 may have foreseen the problems we have had to face since then in dealing with terrorism, both militarily and morally. That film was THE SIEGE, released in the fall of 1998.Co-written and directed by Edward Zwick, whose films include the 1989 Civil War epic GLORY, the 1996 Gulf War film COURAGE UNDER FIRE, and the very chilling 1983 TV film SPECIAL BULLETIN, THE SIEGE depicts the various terrorist attacks leveled upon the Big Apple after the CIA abducts a fundamentalist religious leader (Ahmed Ben Larby). The attackers are followers of this radical Islamist sheik, and unfortunately their tactics have the hallmarks of the CIA all over them, something that becomes all too clear when FBI counter-terrorism agent Anthony Hubbard (Denzel Washington) meets up with CIA agent Elsie Kraft, nee Sharon Bridger (Annette Benning), and they try, without a whole lot of success, to catch the perpetrators. But there is much worse to come; as the attacks keep happening, the United States military, under the command of the staunch general William Deveraux (Bruce Willis), takes charge and hunts down virtually anyone in NYC who just might look like a terrorist (i.e., anyone of Arab\/Islamic extraction), even if that happens to include Washington's FBI partner (Tony Shaloub). Even though Willis implores the Congress at the start of the onslaught not to use the Army as a police force, when push comes to shove, that's what he does on his own&#x85;and, much to Washington's own personal horror, becomes nothing if not Napoleonic in the worst sense of the word in threatening to kill and torture anyone he personally thinks is a terrorist. Thus, the siege of THE SIEGE isn't the terrorist attacks themselves, but the conflict between Willis and Washington, something made manifestly clear near the end as Willis is about to torture a suspect (Amro Salama), and Washington tells him in no uncertain terms If we torture him, General, we do that and everything we have fought, and bled, and died for is over. And they've won. They've already won! THE SIEGE was, at its time, a fairly controversial film, less for its depiction of terrorism and violence than for what many Americans of Muslim and Arabic origin saw as perpetrating a dangerous stereotype of them, a stereotype that they had every right to rail against then, and do even more so in the wake of Paris and San Bernardino. That being said, however, the film does show what history should have told us that overseas covert or military actions carried out years or decades in the past can result in the kind of nightmarish blowback seen here on screen, or for real in New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania on 9\/11. And when martial law is declared in what we like to call our Land of the Free, as happens in this film, then terror can win out, as it almost does even after the attacks themselves stop.Zwick gets plenty of action and tension out of the situation in THE SIEGE, less of a Schwarzenneger free-for-all or even a DIE HARD-type thing (Willis' presence aside) than something more akin to the 1977 John Frankenheimer classic BLACK Sunday; and Washington's Everyman-type FBI agent and Willis' hard-assed general are perfect antagonists. THE SIEGE might have been seen as an 'R'-rated popcorn flick in 1998, but now it is something a bit more in light of the last decade and a half of events, both national and international.

I find that the more I view it, the better it becomes. I don't see it as ridiculous at all. Except maybe for the elderly couple mechanic, especially when they started break dancing! I think the movie is utterly sincere and very heartfelt. Though I didn't see this movie when it came out for various insignificant reasons (I was in the Phils and not sure if it was shown there. If it was, I wouldn't be in a habit of going to the theaters as a college student. I could only afford one movie at the time and I chose to see Jurassic park then. OK, yeah you're not interested in my teen life). I'm not exactly a fan but heck we had a legit intramural cheer song number to the tune of Ice, Ice Baby. And the rave reviews didn't deter me from choosing to view this on Hoopla. I wasn't expecting much. I was looking for something light and moderately entertaining. What I found is an earnest appreciation for it. The opening scene sets the tone for the movie. Dark room but not moody, some strobe lights, but it's not the disco. Dudes and dudettes (terms inappropriate for this genre) were on the dance floor. The energy is apparent. The steady almost graceful kind of motions that won't be mistaken for the hyperactive seizure dance of today, if that may be called as such. I reflected slowly and surely that Robert Matthew Van Winkle captivated my heart. First he can act. He's not awkward on camera. He exudes a kind of steelness quality only someone dubbed as him could warrant. He can dance and not completely unpleasing to the eyes either. Tall, blond and with striking good looks, who wouldn't be enthralled. Not just that, check out the wardrobe and the hairstyle! That haircut alone deserves a separate commentary. Lines shaved with asymmetrical geometric patterns and lightning bolts that extend to the eyebrows! His style is truly like a chemical spill, in Chernobyl!This movie was made 25 years ago and so much in our society have changed since. And people who questioned those scenes have got to understand that it was nonetheless still a different culture back then. Ghettos on motorbikes weren't so scary and suspicious. In this movie, they're simply a band of artist. A rapper and his break-dancing home-boys and well one home-girl. The representative kid in this movie, a 10-yr old boy, is aware of sex nut not obsessed about it even when he often chides his sister about i). The word sex is spoken but not done, even off camera. The romantic montage, which could very easily be littered with soft porn slow motion takes and salacious poses, was kept clean. (Considering the director's previous playboy flicks). There was not even tongue! It was GP. The movie simply isn't interested in sex. Come to think of it, I don't believe there were any curse words either. I don't recall hearing the 4-letter F word. The editing was smart using ingenious camera angles combined with tongue-in-cheek props (green eggs, Quotes on wallpaper, crazy fun-house cum garage). Cinematography is on par, nothing less to be expected from a future academy holder. And the writing? Words of wisdom such as ... If you ain't true to yourself then you ain't true to nobody Live your life for someone else, you ain't livin' It's not where you're from, it's where you're at Can you put it back together with quickness?... it's like Shakespeare!

Well there were things that just annoyed me like, when nobody suspected Palpatine, even after they were told to by Dooku or when Obi-Wan didn't see Jango's suit, which was behind the bounty hunter the whole time.
