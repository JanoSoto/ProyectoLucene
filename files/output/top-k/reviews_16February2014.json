[{"date":"16 February 2014","score":"","review":" No Bones about it. Only an Angel could sit through this film. David Boreanaz's Valentine is one of those contemporary Slasher films that is riding off the coattails of 1996's Scream success. Rather than trying to be like its own movie, it follow a lot of the previous film clichés to the point that the film rarely stands out. If 1978's Halloween is a good example on how to make a holiday themed horror flick; Valentine is the worst. The film is loosely based on the novel of the same name by Tom Savage. The novel's characters, settling and plot are very different from the film. The book is pretty awful source material, but at less if the movie follow more of it, the film wouldn't be as bad as it is, now. One of the film's biggest mistakes, is the way, they try to make it, suspenseful. The movie tries really hard to make you ask, who done it, but clearly can't pull it off. The killer, Jeremy Melton, is killing people because at junior high school prom. It was there, he was cruelly shot down by some really over the top valley girls. If that wasn't enough, he was then bully by their boy\/friends. Instead, of going on a school shooting, the next day, the killers waits 13 years later on Valentine Day for some unexplained reason to get revenge on the girls. Honestly, I don't know why he waited so long. He clearly got over it and by this time, can get any woman, he wants. The movie doesn't really explain, what trigger him to kill them after waiting for so long, but hey, we wouldn't have a movie, could we. Another thing, why didn't he even bother trying to kill the real people that treat him badly. You know, the boys that strip him down and beat him? It's such disproportionate retribution. One thing, the movie does too much in the beginning is gives way too much information about who the killer is. Without spoiling it, It's pretty obvious who it is. Honestly, who in the hell would believe the killer is a girl, when you see that Jeremy Melton in the beginning? If he had a sex-change, he clearly wouldn't be any of the girls that dissed off the guy in the first place. So, by making one of the victim, a suspense of the murders, doesn't make any sense, movie. Then the movie has the nerves to give other list of red herring suspects that isn't even close to believable that they were the killer. If you thought, they were, they get axed off, anyways, so you can tell who it is, by the end. At less, make the fake out guys, seem like their death was needed because they were the bullies that hurt Jeremy, but no. They were just random dudes at the wrong place, wrong time. You really got nobody to root for as all the victims character are god-awful clichés horror stereotypes. The girls grown up to be even sluttier. Denise Richards as Paige Prescott fit the role, well, but isn't really giving anything new. She is just an awful typecast actress. Oh, and there's no nudity, in case you were curious. The women deaths throughout the film are bit an ironic foreshadowing. You would think the killer would be a little bit clever with the deaths. While, the kills are remotely alike, and he does use some really innovative weapons. It's nothing, we haven't saw before. Mid, while the killer is able to do a lot of unrealistic things like change clothes in seconds during attack scenes, and pulled off being at two places at once. While the concept of the masked killer is far from original, the cherub mask is a cool, creepy look. It could had been better. Director Jamie Blank really could had done, something about the pacing in this film. It's so damn slow. The movie put so much time on minor character's character development, that the main characters have very few of them. The soundtrack is pretty OK, but I don't think it add anything to the story. I don't find any of the main characters listening to Disturbed or Rob Zombie on their down time. The soundtrack compilation was even lampooned in a sketch by Saturday Night Live because how 'out of place' it was in the film. The movie even steal a Halloween style score in the beginning, but never truly use well. I thought it would add more a creepy feel to the film, rather sounding like a bad written heavy metal fan horror mystery film. I wouldn't say, it's the worst horror movie of all time, but don't expect to come in, hoping anything to stand out. It's just your typical slasher film. The original 1981's My Bloody Valentine, another Valentine's Day-themed slasher flick is a little bit better if you want something rather than a rom-com for Valentine Day.

There are preconceived notions in high school that have to be maintained. Now let's throw in a plot twist; welcome to The Breakfast Club, it consists of a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess, and a criminal. Not your clichéd friends by any means, but this is who find themselves spending much unwanted time together. The Breakfast Club is a must-see movie that will send you back to the glory days of high school. We all lived it. We all knew these people. We all can relate. Five very different high school students, each representing their own typical group of the 80's, spend their Saturday in detention. With the common high school cliques being broken, the jock, the nerd, the glamour girl, the loner and the druggy are forced to coexist. As the movie progresses, the changes in plot demonstrate the typical stereotypes becoming broken. It is emphasized that the students aren't as different as they seem. They all have pressures from their home life and stressors at school. Throughout the day as they try to avoid their overbearing principal, the student's bonds strengthen due to the disintegrating stereotypes, to the point that they all end up leaving detention as one. Strong relationships are made and the people who are least likely to remain friends find relationships, as the students realize each other's personal problems tie them all together. The excellent acting in the movie allows the changes in stereotypes to reach full potential. Judd Nelson embodies Carl, the bad boy druggy, and owns the part. One moment he has you laughing, the next crying, and the next making you want to knock him square in the face. His mysterious trickery allows him to pull information out of his fellow classmates that most would, by no means, even consider asking. He encompasses the attitude associated with his character, haggling all of the other students and pushing the exact buttons to set them off. His physicality is superb; he becomes up close and personal, breaking respected bubbles. Whether he is arguing with the demanding principal or jamming out on the top of the sculpture in the library, he leaves you wanting more, discovering sides to him that you never knew existed. With many of the roles being very credible including parts played by Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy, the principal, Paul Gleason, seemed to fall short in some scenes, especially during his argument with Nelson. When Nelson was questioning authority Gleason states, I'm begging you, take a shot. Just one hit. This is a phrase that could be very intimidating, but the acting did not hold up to the line. The phrase could have been said with much more gusto and anger behind it, making the principal sound threatening; unfortunately there was no acting there to assist in his cause. Regardless, the stellar acting by the five students help make up for the principal, who only plays a supporting role in the movie. The leads did a fabulous job portraying their characters and owning their parts, stepping up to the plate and hitting a home run. With its fantastic plot line and characters, The Breakfast Club is a movie set apart from the rest. Yes, it is different, but different is good. It is a much needed change from your usual high-school aged movie. Due to its contradicting plot line of character portrayal, you won't want to stop watching. You will want to discover their story and how the students changed in their day-long adventure. Don't you forget about The Breakfast Club!

It does have a bit of a teen comedy feel even tough its much more serious and dark but i wish that part would had last longer.Finally the third part with the actors was really forgivable... boring even to be honest, and its disappointing the movie pretty much end with it, adding only a little story conclusion at the end.So bottom line what can i say... i liked part of this movie, i didn't like others, i am NOT a fan of movies cut into pieces and showing different point of views a la Pulp Fiction, but at least this one was made so the story is unfold in order, unlike Pulp Fiction, which was hard to follow and boring to my own taste.I will say i am glad i finally watched it, had a good time but its going to the pawnshop with my next back of DVDs for sale... If i could put 6.5 on 10, i would, but the movie does not qualify to a 7 to me.

As always, Sylvester Stallone provides just such an outing with this tired third outing as the monotone killing machine John Rambo. Like the second film, it is a balls-out, no-holds-barred action blast that couldn't be any more masculine if it tried. But for those of you wishing the character would go back to his first appearance in the superior First Blood, this is a depressing, remorseless excuse for our 'hero' to gun down anyone who gets vaguely in his way without showing a hint of personality, charisma or charm.Now living a more peaceful existence helping Buddhist monks rebuild their temple, Rambo (Stallone) is contacted once again by his old commanding officer, Col. Trautman (Richard Crenna) who wants Rambo's assistance with a dangerous mission against the Soviets in Afghanistan. Rambo refuses so Trautman goes instead but the mission goes horribly wrong and Trautman finds himself help captive by Russian Colonel Zaysen (Marc de Jonge). Rambo is then told of this by shady Government-type Griggs (Kurtwood Smith), who then agrees to go and rescue him. Teaming up with the Mujahideen rebels led by Masoud (Spiros Focás), Rambo is accompanied by Mousa (Sasson Gabai) as he heads towards the heavily-guarded Soviet base on his seemingly impossible quest to rescue his one true friend.Given that the Soviet Union was already starting to crumble when it was released, Rambo III was out-of-touch before it even hit the big screen. Nowadays it embarrasses with its staunchly pro-American themes and almost naïve attitude to the Afghan people and the Mujahideen (who now, ironically, seem to spend their time fighting the US forces currently based in Afghanistan). Although it wasn't the first film to depict Rambo as an unstoppable force of nature, it underlined that characterisation here as Rambo pulls off numerous acts of violence and barely suffers a wound. And when he is injured, he's so tough that he cauterises the wound using gunpowder that goes straight through him! But of course! If anything, Rambo's almost robotic personality suits Stallone's performance which is as wooden as you'd expect although I'd like someone to tell me why Stallone waits until Rambo & Trautman team up before the one-liners start coming - where have they been hiding for two and a half films? Like most Sly outings, Rambo III is the perfect movie to download for free when you've got the guys coming over with a load of beers. It's stupid, brutal, illogical (why did Trautman think that a traumatised Vietnam veteran would be any good in the deserts of Afghanistan?) and ultimately not worth your time. These films always seem to have a personal agenda for Rambo instead of some threat to world peace and the American people - after all, is Zaysen doing anything other than following his orders like a good colonel should? Yes, he's especially mean against the native Afghan population but why should that bother Rambo once he's finally discovered his personal peace? I enjoyed First Blood but these sequels (and the recent, blood-soaked sequel in 2008) have left a nasty taste in my mouth as they are little more than exercises in violence and pyrotechnics. Looking at the estimated budget of $63 million dollars, I'm stumped to suggest where the money went other than on a vast array of military vehicles for Rambo to shoot at and Stallone's own salary. Please, stick with the original or if you want a decent action blast then watch the original Die Hard which had genuine laughs, a charismatic hero you could get behind, a memorable villain and tension throughout.

Romantic comedies, which this has often been dubbed to be the first, of all screwball comedies. While its not, it's definitely the best. From writing, casting, superb acting, and directing. From Gables inebriated nonchalant disrespect of anything he see as a barrier to a good thing, to his charming and overtly sexual grin, his threatening to (sexually) spank Colbert, to him clobbering a highway thief--this comedy has more romance and adventure, than most romance and adventure films claim to have.There's even some singing, per the era, and it fits nicely into this picture. Colbert was perfectly cast, and does her part well as the spoiled little rich girl, who needed a good thrashing and a real man to take charge and plow through anything to tear down the walls of Jericho. If chem-labs at school were as copacetic as Gable and Colbert, I'd be feeding carrots to lab animals. Their chemistry is undeniable the best sexual, comedic, and dramatic chemistry of any film. This is 1934, and for mainstream films, female legs (and men's), spankings, sexual undertones, women hitchhiking, and the likes, we're frowned upon (not in the dirty B cinemas) and Capra and team did right to keep if PG, or else it'd be a simply lost film, looped in with other, muddy, grainy pictures from the era. This one has a warm, soft tone in the lens. I remember seeing it on TV and VHS years ago, and it's as good as the restored versions.

Eastwood plays a mysterious gunfighter hired by the residents of a corrupt frontier mining town to defend them against a group of criminals. The film was influenced by the work of Eastwood's two major collaborators, film directors Sergio Leone and Don Siegel. The film was shot on location on the shores of Mono Lake, California. The screenplay was written by Ernest Tidyman, who also wrote the novelization. Dee Barton provided the eerie film score. The film was critically acclaimed at the time of its initial release and still is, holding a score of 96% on Rotten Tomatoes. Directed by Clint Eastwood, Produced by Robert Daley, Written by Ernest Tidyman RELEASE DATES August 22, 1973 RUNNING TIME 105 minutesSTARRING Clint Eastwood as The Stranger, Verna Bloom as Sarah Belding, Mariana Hill as Callie Travers, Billy Curtis as Mordecai, Mitchell Ryan as Dave Drake, Jack Ging as Morgan Allen, Stefan Gierasch as Mayor Jason Hobart, Ted Hartley as Lewis Belding, William O'Connell as the Barber, and Geoffrey Lewis as Stacey Bridge SUMMARY A stranger on horseback rides into the mining town of Lago. Three gun-toting men follow him into the saloon, taunting him. When they follow him to the barbershop and threaten him, the Stranger shoots and kills all three of them. Impressed with this performance, a dwarf named Mordecai, who works in the barbershop, befriends the Stranger. An attractive woman named Callie Travers bumps into the Stranger in the street on purpose, insults, and badgers him. When she slaps his cigar from his mouth, he drags her into the livery stable and rapes her. Next, he rents a room at the hotel. That night, he dreams about a man being brutally whipped. It is revealed later that Marshal Jim Duncan was whipped to death by gunfighters Stacey Bridges, Dan Carlin, and Cole Carlin while the people of Lago looked on. Only Sarah Belding, wife of hotelier Lewis Belding, attempted to rescue him. A corrupt faction in Lago wanted Duncan dead; as the Marshal discovered that the town's mine is on government ground, (the townsfolk feared that this news, if reported, would result in the mine being closed, which would threaten the town's livelihood). Sheriff Sam Shaw tells the Stranger he will not be charged for killing the three men. Meanwhile, the townsmen discuss Bridges and the Carlin brothers, who are due to be released from prison that day. The town double-crossed the three gunfighters after they killed Duncan, and the men are expected to seek vengeance. Since the men slain by the Stranger were the mining company's new protectors, the townsmen decide to hire the Stranger as their replacement. Presenting the offer to the Stranger, Shaw explains that the three gunfighters were caught stealing gold from the mining company, although he admits the gold was poorly protected. The Stranger declines the job until Shaw tells him he can have anything he wants. Accepting these terms, the Stranger indulges in the town's goods and services, and makes Mordecai both sheriff and mayor. He also has Belding's clients moved out of the hotel, dismantles Belding's barn in order to make picnic benches, has the entire town painted red, and paints the word HELL on the LAGO sign just outside of town. While the Stranger trains the townspeople to defend themselves, Bridges and the Carlin brothers are released from prison and make their way to Lago. They begin on foot but kill three men and take their horses. A group of townsfolk tries to ambush the Stranger in the hotel, but he kills all but one of them. After Belding inadvertently divulges his complicity in the attack, (which left the hotel destroyed), the Stranger drags Sarah Belding into their room, and she sleeps with him willingly. The next morning, Sarah tells the Stranger about Duncan's murder, and how Duncan was buried in an unmarked grave. She remarks, They say the dead don't rest without a marker of some kind. QUESTIONS Why did the Stranger ride out of town the next morning? Who did the Stranger fine? What color did the people paint the town? What happen when the gunfighters hit town? MY THOUGHTS To me this movie was kind of had a very slow pace to it. You knew the climax long before it happen which made this movie boring. I thought that Clint Eastwood did great in his role as the Stranger. However, there was no one backing him up. The other thing missing in this movie was a leading lady.
