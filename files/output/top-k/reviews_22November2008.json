In this film we are introduced to James Bond, a British secret agent with a license to kill. When an agent named John Strangways and his secretary are killed while stationed in Jamaica, Bond is sent there to investigate. He meets up with a CIA agent named Felix Leiter who helps him in his investigation, which leads them to a small island owned by a mysterious man named Dr. No. Bond suspects that Dr. No's activities on the island are criminal and may have something to do with the Strangways' disappearance. He and a local fisherman named Quarrel take a boat to Dr. No's island where they come across a local girl named Honey Ryder. They are captured and taken to Dr. No's lair, where Dr. No reveals he is working for SPECTRE, an organization bent on world domination. Now it's up to Bond to stop Dr. No in his tracks.When you watch this film, it seems so simple compared to what the series turned into down the line. This movie, while not my favourite Bond film, is a prime example of what a James Bond film should be. Bond doesn't use any gadgets in this film at all. He relies on his skill and his intelligence to get the mission done. Sean Connery plays the role perfectly, giving us a James Bond that has a sense of humour, but not too over the top with ridiculous one liners, and at the same time completely ruthless and deadly serious about his job. The film plays more on the espionage side of Bond's work rather than taking up too much time with ridiculous action sequences, and when the fight scenes and the climatic final action sequence do happen, they're exciting and not too over the top. One of my favourite moments in this film is when James Bond is sitting in a chair and he shoots a would be assassin twice, without any expression on his face. To me this says everything about who James Bond is and how he does his job.Now, I have to admit that even though I praise this film for being more about the espionage and less about the action, I do feel there could be more of a balance. If you're not in the mood this film can drag a little bit. I got 40 minutes into the movie and felt like it had to be halfway through, even though I was enjoying it. Also, Dr. No isn't the best Bond villain. He may have robotic hands capable of crushing a bronze statuette, but his first appearance isn't as menacing as it could be, his plan isn't really explained that well and his motives are weak, and his end is a little anti-climatic. All in all this is a good start to a franchise that would have its ups and downs over the years.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 November 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Dr. No is the first film in the long running James Bond 007 franchise.

They use low-key lighting, which darkens the picture, which not only makes the sets minimal, but also casts the dark mood of the film.Also like film noir, the story is centered on a woman, Frances Mcdormand's character, however, the movie departs from this due to the fact that her character is not a villain or power hungry like the woman in Out of the Past, but the men around her fall into destruction. Her husband wants to kill her, her boyfriend wants to escape and live with her, and there's a psychopathic PI that her jealous husband hired to kill her and her boyfriend.Not to ruin the movie for those of you who haven't seen the movie yet, but it ends like a film noir picture in the sense that no ones wins, however, the main character prevails. And the last shot of the film will leave you to ponder on what it symbolizes.As I mentioned above, I liked the lighting as well as the suspenseful score by Carter Burwell, but it all comes down to the breathtaking talent of the Coen Brothers.

John Schlesinger's direction is wired and trippy -- Stanley Kubrick seems to have utilized the wild-eyed flashbacks and drug-induced hazes of the camera-work here as the basis of the cinematography of A Clockwork Orange -- it's a hyper-realist depiction of the world. It can be off-putting and distracting, but it rarely is such a terrible thing these moments of intense energy are often inner revelations of the characters; thus what we see is meant to reflect their present mental or emotional state.The movie's only flaw is that it runs too long.

Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins) who is a fresh faced college graduate gets a job in the mail room of the hugely successful Hudsucker Industries. On his first day on the job the chairman of the Hudsucker industries commits suicide. Board of Directors led by Sidney J. Mussberger (Paul Newman) decides to lower the companies stock by installing an idiot in his place, then taking advantage of lowered stock price. Barnes is the innocent idiot.This film is simply loud and annoying; every thing is overdone. For example,the scene where Barnes has to take the blue letter to the office was so annoying at one point I thought about turning off the damn thing. The bullet fast dialogue is unfunny and not as clever as it tried to be. Every single shot and dialogue is overdone to a point that it becomes unwatchable. This film feels like a parody sketch on a comedy show or a children's film.Tim Robbins and Paul Newman did a pretty good job (as usual). But Jennifer Jason Leigh's character is more annoying then nails on a chalkboard. Surely she has got to be one of the most irritating movie characters that I have ever seen. Every time she was on the screen I felt like shooting my TV screen. Her portrayal of a fast talking career women who thinks she is one of the boys is painfully unfunny and simply stupid.

I can't really compare Goodfellas to The Godfather because they're two totally different films. Goodfellas is shown and told through Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) whose only dream was to be a wise guy. The movie follows his journey from starting out as a youth who ran errands to the mob, to being one of the mob's closest members, and his eventual downfall.To cover many of the details in the film, there's much voice-over narration. In many movies, I find that a lot of narration is irritating and at times makes me loose interest in a film since I like to be shown what the film is about, not told. But the narration is a definite exception to this movie because it not only reveals the film as a past event, but also gets into the thoughts and feelings of the main character Henry. His girlfriend Karen (Lorraine Bracco), who later becomes his wife, also has her share of voice-over. An essential part to the film is both of their narration since it not only reveals their thoughts in a given scene, but it also develops a strong bond between the two, which later spirals.Scorsese's direction (who I think can relate a lot to the film, as person who grew up in New York City) is a key driving force in the film. There are many excellent shots in it that I could probably write a book on them. The one that stands out the most for me is in a scene where Henry takes Karen on a date. The camera follows them from the car, past a line of people at the entrance, down a flight of stairs, through a kitchen, and into the restaurant where a few waiters set up a table for them to be in the front of the floor show. This is the power of the mob, but everything that has a beginning has an end. I won't give the end of the film away, but the main man Ray goes from a real somebody to a nobody, which plays in the irony of the film. He gets it all, but then loses it.Another main ingredient in this film is Thelma Schoonmaker's editing. I have come to call her the greatest film editor of all time, and her work of freeze framing scenes, as well as clean cuts in between scenes are priceless. When it comes to the acting, all are great, but Joe Pesci is the real master. I recognize him mostly for being in the Lethal Weapons and Home Alones, but his skills are put to the test in this film as the likable, yet psychotic Tommy. His Oscar was well-deserved (the academy got it right for once).Goodfellas though is not a movie for everyone. There's a lot of language (mostly said by Pesci) and some strong bloody violence that may shock and disturb viewers.

I will write a simple example September is a film that I can easily find on DVD at a very decent price however it doesn't look very attractive. Take the Money and Run is a film that is kind of difficult to find on DVD and since the Region 4 DVD doesn't exist you can only find the R1 at a higher price yet I always wanted to watch Take the Money and Run. Right now I want to watch every Woody Allen film so soon I will be watching September and certainly when I found Take the Money and Run last week I doesn't missed the chance and yes other Woody Allen films can wait. And I'm glad I finally saw this film; early Allen is not my favourite however is really good and now this film wasn't the exception. Basically we enjoy the story of a life, the story of Virgil Starkwell (Allen), so we enjoy the story of the life of Virgil, a criminal life that never really changed. We see the persons who knew Virgil, we see his parents (we don't see their actual faces since they are very ashamed of their son so they look like Groucho Marx) and many others who knew Virgil. Near the end we see a girl who says that for her was totally unbelievable that Virgil was actually a criminal, certainly he never looked like a gangster. Virgil himself says that to be criminal is a really good job since you are like your own boss in other good things. So we have a case of a criminal who likes his job and who can be seen by society as a normal guy, is perfect to have a case of a brilliant criminal yet with Virgil we see, and certainly enjoy, one of the lamest criminals of all time! So this is the story of Virgil's life then we will see some unsuccessful jobs, his days in prison, his escapes (he was at least lucky enough to never complete his sentences and his one and only love, Louise (extremely beautiful Janet Margolin. To mention all the memorable stuff from this film I will need to bore you however I don't want that then will only mention some.

It was so difficult for Virgil to convince the employees that it was a robbery since he couldn't write well the note! And you what, he ended in prison. You will find many hilarious moments (I loved one of the very last scenes and yes it is when Virgil is finally captured by an old friend now part of the FBI) with this early Allen (and also you can call it pre-Zelig), definitely a favourite of mine from those years so absolutely recommended!

However, this version of him was mislead into believing that prophet Muhammed (PBUH) was actually guiding him - resurrected from death and living amongst them as a black man. Consequently, all his charisma was directed against the whites believing that Islam came to empower blacks and that Allah's prophet was black and that it was time for them to rise after 400 years of suppression. His followers increased by time and his word became highly credible and this caused envy and divisions within this Nation of Islam where the so-claimed Muhamed started tensing things up with him after once appointing him to be his voice to the people. It was then that Malcolm started doubting the beliefs he taught and that this man to whom he was ready to sacrifice himself was no more than a hypocrite; therefore, he split from the group, publicly announcing his independence as a leader and his formulating an Islamic group of his own to which he would lead after fulfilling his pilgrimage duties. Nonetheless, his trip to Mecca was the actual light that lit his path back from where he was deviating. Once back at America, his preaches took a different direction and he started preaching of equality rather than supremacy, and it was then that he proclaimed his errors and tried to call for real peace. Unfortunately, it was too late..

He s gotta theory behind everything &#150; he s got an opinion on everything. And that too backed by his own logic. A TV character, a painting, a piece of art, a movie, a person, a specific behaviour, a loaf of bread, an orgasm &#150; he has an opinion about everything. In fact, in the movie, you will find him commenting on most of the things mentioned. He just loves to talk, talk about everything around him (even himself) He is very volatile and over reacts to everything. He uses phrases like oh my God, Can you believe that, this is so crazy too often. He s so spontaneous with expressing his thoughts that at times he hardly pays any attention to what the other person has to say. I loved him because he s so smooth and natural with his lines. He has a great sense of humour &#150; most of the times it comes as sarcasm in the movie. Throughout the movie he makes sarcastic comments during serious discussions- they kind of take the severity away from the scene (without inducing humour into it)- don't stare at me with those big eyes. You look like one of those barefoot kids from Bolivia who needs foster parents. i'm here to strangle you. What do you mean, the book makes me look like Lee Harvey Oswald. He has a gift of gab. You feel, if he can frame sentences like this impromptu, he could be possibly be a great writer. He hardly ever loses his temper but gets irritated so easily. He's very spontaneous. He leaves his job in a whiff because he gets irritated by what they do. He didn't raise his voice or anything &#150; just irritated. Spur of the moment decision &#150; i quit. He says i don't get angry, i tend to internalize feelings &#150; it was so true of his character. He came out as someone with great moral sense. I don't know how many people would have actually showed the '17-year old girl' the right direction and would have openly admitted that they're too old for her. Maybe because he wasn't actually in love with her and he had other great options (New York City had the largest proportion of single women in America). Later when i though more about it, he didn't quite come out as someone with great conscience &#150; i think even back in '79 it was unlawful (and thus unconscientious) to have sex with a under 17 yr old. Try and think of it &#150; he was enjoying sleeping with the girl and wanted no strings attached. He kept emphasizing that they don't have a future. The moment he started seeing (and sleeping with) Keaton, he broke off with her. At the end when Keaton leaves him, he tries to get back with the, then, 18-yr old. Woody's character looked so rational in the rest of the movie, but this part showed that he too is vulnerable. He too is psychotic in his own way. He rationalizes things and make them convincing to reduce the cognitive dissonance. He may rebuff his own decision if the situation turns unfavourable (trying to convince the girl not to go to London). This makes him look more human. We're all flawed and it was relieving to see him weak too, at some point in time. I also wanna describe Woddy's character as newyoker. Hates his new apartment, complains about the city (and yet seems crazy about it), divorced, into arts, well-read, surrounded by neurotic problems, etc. His character has all the elements of a sex and the city character. Given the title of the movie, i think its a job well done. Extra points to director.The 17 year old girl I don't know if the director did it on purpose &#150; but it looked like the role was played by someone who was acting for the first time in life. She was expressionless throughout the movie &#150; there was no juice in her acting. Initially i thought not acting was a part of her role, and was acting like that because she was playing a placid teenager. I couldn't take a stance of her acting skills. But she was crying at the cafe, it looked horrible &#150; she was literally squelching her eyes to make the tears come out of them. It looked so un-natural. This is the point in the movie when I felt putting her was directors mistake. Off the topic, (and hopefully off the record) she's damn attractive. Tall, slim, great hair, flawless face, cute lips & nose. Probably because of the way director dressed her up &#150; she didn't quite look too sexually attractive.Diane Keaton - I thought she brilliantly played part of a middle-age, low-on-confidence and insecure woman who's initially having an affair with a married man. The scene where she tries to talk to her lover, answer the phone and shoo the dog all at the same time accentuates her acting skills. She s a small town morally just girl in big dirty city &#150; keeps reminding people&#150; i'm from philadephia, i don't do thatThe Movie - Doesn't have any unnecessary background music. In fact, there is no music until towards the end &#150; after Woody gets up and leaves, i gotta get some air. Even then, the music was so apt &#150; it makes us feel whats going through Woody's mind (i have had enough). Loved it!

It's basically Raiders of the Lost Ark for children, every bit as hilarious and exciting. It's the story of a group of friends (and potential girlfriends) who go searching for pirates treasure in the hopes that they can save their homes from foreclosure in the process. They come into contact with a family of thieves and a disfigured but utterly lovable Sloth, along with a host of boobie traps that are so wonderfully simple, the spectacular events on screen seem really possible in real life.Another great thing about the Goonies is that it has a character for every personality type. THere's the cheerleader, the fat kid, the arrogant but witty best friend,the genius, and the idealistic dreamer. In short, there's a character in this movie for every kid to relate to.Unfortunately, I have heard that if you didn't see this movie as a child, it has substantially less value as an adult. Therefore, buy it for your kids (they'll treasure it forever), and rent it for yourself (just so you know what all the fuss is about) ","genre":null},{"date":"22 November 2008","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" The Goonies is a great film for kids.

Of what, though? Ah, that is not so difficult a question to answer.Alex Proyas is most famous for his rendering of The Crow, a noir-influenced comic book adaptation turned bloodfeast. Its rough, canted hues and heavy silhouettes focused that work into a study of the virtues of revenge and the vices of redemption. Fast-forward four years, and Proyas sheds the inbred angst in a quest to reinvent science fiction. What he has created is mature and frightening, a singular vision that should rightly be compared to such films as Fritz Lang's Metroplolis and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner.The plot begins with an introduction by Kiefer Sutherland the Strangers, an alien race, are all but extinct, and in order to prolong their lives they are studying humans in hopes of unlocking the secrets to the eternal soul. Sound cheesy? That's because it is -- but then again, so was Blade Runner, with its replicants' difficulties grappling with a conscience. John Murdoch is the object of their obsession for the duration of the movie, as he has achieved the ability to tune, meaning he can reshape the physical world purely at will. But Murdoch's memory is murky -- he doesn't know whom to trust, if anyone. All he knows is that he needs to get to Shell Beach.The plot is pretty straightforward, simple and uncomplicated. But this movie is not self-contained like, say, The Matrix was; this is not a plot-driven hypothetical. Dark City is a vision, a cinematic language of noir imitating sci-fi and vice versa. It is complete in that it is a thorough visual treat ominous, foreboding set pieces loom; and cityscapes blend and diverge. It is a world wholly unique yet still hauntingly familiar. It is a chamber drama, marrying existential paranoia with hardboiled mystery.So what kind of masterpiece is Dark City, really? A visual masterpiece? Certainly. But it's more than that. It's a reimagination of our world, and a new way to contemplate the dilemma of humanity -- as I heard it put in a song recently Do you know where the self resides\/ Is it in your head or between your sides? Proyas doesn't pretend to know or give the answer, but it might have something to do with Shell Beach.

I knew that it was supposed to be marvelous and therefore I had high expectations right for the start. And, thank God, I wasn't disappointed at all!Julia plays a stalwart, authoritative, somewhat arrogant woman with amazing adroitness. She is so good in this role that you ignore all her cursing and yet love her. Albert Finney too plays his role well though I thought that he could have been better in some shots. Eckhart too does a really good job as a 'maid\/lover' of Erin .What I feel that could have improved was the character development. I felt that nothing changed in the character's traits. Also, some of the sub-plots could have been handled better. Its a monster of a story and that's why probably it wasn't possible to focus on all the characters and give them more attention.The story is absolutely tremendous with fabulous and witty dialogs. The It's called b00bs line is my favorite. The ending is satisfactory. The main punch of this movie is that it never gets dull even though its a bit long. Well, to be frank, I felt that they could have increased the pace in some of the scenes but that didn't make it completely unenlightening.Overall, I'm going to give this an eight. Don't forget to catch it on the television. If this 15 year old loves it, then I feel that it would be relished by almost anyone.
