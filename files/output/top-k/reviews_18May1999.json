But i don´t agree with the ones who defend it as being nothing more than a big friendship story either.This is a Love story all right.Once again LUC BESSON has managed to create and film another truly original and impossible adult love story in wich love is presented first of all as an emotion.Like in  BIG BLUE\/LE GRAND BLEU , BESSON is much more interested in presenting Love as a pure human feeling than as something that is conditioned by the actual modern society.In other movies love is always depending on external factors and almost controls the story and the characters. When LUC BESSON films it, love is always present but in a pure and subtle way, that apparently doesn´t interfere directly in the main story, but ends up being the cause of it.He films it only as an emotion that isn´t depending in gender, race,sex, or in this case age. That´s why he never uses this emotion to create the usual subplots for his movies. Because it´s too pure and simple and it would be very dificult to invent some conflicts for the story and at the same time keep it like that.Maybe i´m sounding too intellectual, but i can´t find another way to explain what i think. That´s what i like about Luc Besson. He first makes us feel, then he makes us think.So this is why i think there is nothing dirty about this movie. Pedophilia here is on the minds of the people who wish to see it. There is a love story between Leon and Mathilda, but it´s just that. Love.True love, if you like. Everybody can imagine they have sex if they want to, but don´t go blame the movie for it.The only dirty shamefull scenes in LEON are in the minds of the people who wished they were there in the first place. Of course everyone thinks about the possibility of sex between Leon and Mathilda, but that´s not because of what´s in the movie. It´s because we are conditioned to think this way.There is nothing wrong with this movie. It´s original, it has a fabulous story, very human characters, excellent action scenes and amazing actors. And it has style ! JEAN RENO is an amazing actor as he had already proved in  THE BIG BLUE , and it´s great to see him in a role where he can show is worth for a change. Unfortunately in Hollywood no one seems to have noticed this because his later characters in american productions have all been nothing more than cardboard clichés. But that´s Hollywood.The rest of the cast couldn´t have been better. The girl Natalie Portman, is already a magnificent actress and G.Oldman and Danny Aielo are perfect for their characters.This is a fantastic movie. See it without any pre-conceived ideas and you´ll love it. A true love story.

But who would have expected such a miracle from her in the screenwriting department? Some of the most dramatic moments in 'Sense and Sensibility' come from her pen, not Jane Austen's, difficult as that may be to believe. For instance, the scene in which Col. Brandon (Alan Rickman) carries in the ill Marianne Dashwood (Kate Winslet), echoing the earlier scene where Willoughby (Greg Wise) brought the injured young woman home was Thompson's doing. Marianne's illness also is responsible for much more drama in the movie than in the book. And I'm an Austen fan! I can't recall another writer bringing so much good of his or her own to a classic like this.I suppose the director, cinematographer, production designer, etc. deserve to share the credit when a movie is this outstanding, but with such a super group of actors on the screen (from top to bottom) it's easy to heap all the praise on them. I had unconsciously (and unfairly) pigeonholed Alan Rickman based on the other role I'd seen him in, the villain in 'Die Hard,' so he was quite a surprise to me. The real bombshell, however, was my first exposure to Kate Winslet. After seeing this movie and Kenneth Branagh's 'Hamlet' I can say I can't remember another young actress who has impressed me so much. And she played these difficult roles by the time she was 20! Many of the other cast members are a part of an excellent group that Thompson and Branagh have often worked with in the past.I realized that 'S&S' had become one of my all-time favorite movies when I found myself watching it every chance I got when it came on TV.

If that's so, I think Neo and the gang could've done a bit more stunt work in the film if gravity could be ignored and walking up walls was so easy. Another thing that ticked me off was the constant REPETITIVE slow-motion dolly-shots. All right, so maybe Reeves is faster than any man possible...SHOW IT! Slow motion just makes the audience feel stupid (as they're forced to take in an huge amount of detail, forcing me to nod off in my seat in the middle of the gun fight in the lobby).Gun play in the film was...uh...alright, I guess but the hand-to-hand akido and 'kung-fu' (I KNOW that wasn't Kung-Fu) was excellent (full support to the stunt coordinator, who's name escapes me for now), so a little less on the Mac10s and a little more Mac-Truck punches, please.Direction was alright but the dialogue was a snooze. Over all the film was choking to be a good Johnny Mnemonic (Is that at all possible?) with good SFX and plot. It failed in the latter.

In this film Poitier's character, Mark Thackeray, is less committed to his task than the protagonists in the aforementioned movies, but is no less dedicated in his resolve to instill self respect and empathy in his pupils.The desire to do so stems from his own realisation that he was once in their shoes, and was able to escape the downward spiral wrought by poverty. At the same time, he faces a dilemma in furthering his own career (as an engineer) at the expense of his students. The tension between the two choices - engineer or teacher - might be unpalatable to career teachers, but is deftly handled by director\/writer James Clavell as he sets up a series of set-pieces designed to test Thackeray's mettle.The students are ultimately the catalyst for Thackeray's decision. Unruly, vulgar and contemptuous of authority Thackeray gradually pierces their armour to reveal their underlying humanity. Poitier's performance, aided by an excellent supporting cast including Judy Geeson and Lulu, portrays this gradual revelation without any cloying sentiment.
