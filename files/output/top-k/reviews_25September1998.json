And he got way more than he bargained for with the Predator.Before his crowning achievement of Die Hard, John McTiernan assembled a group of seven muscle-bound commandos in the South American jungle and let them unleash hell on Latino, Russian and Aliens alike with an awesome arsenal of macho weaponry. This is definitely a boys' movie. Both Alien and Aliens - hell, even Friday The 13th - had a thing about two females going head to head at the end. How are us guys supposed to get a kick out of endings like that? Arnie plays Major Alan 'Dutch' Schaefer, the leader of an elite Spec Ops force. His team is called to duty by General Phillips (R.G. Armstrong) and the very suspicious Dillon (Carl Weathers) to rescue a bunch of government officials, who have been shot down in enemy territory in Latin America.As soon as they arrive in the jungle something is watching their every move from the trees. And they get the feeling that things just ain't right. The first rescue team is found disembowelled and skinned. Same goes for their chopper.None of them trust Dillon. He's up to no good. There are no cabinet ministers being held hostage, just a bunch of his CIA pals being tortured by the Russians. In no less than five minutes, all seven of them completely obliterate a rebel guerrilla camp. The CIA hostages are dead.Dutch is angry and feels mighty betrayed. Dillon lied to him and their mission is over as soon as it started. All they have to do is make a journey through one valley to the nearest rendezvous point and fly back home. Not so simple when a high-tech, seemingly invisible, 7'2'', extra-terrestrial Rastafarian hunter is picking them off one by one and keeping their skulls as trophies. This predator is obviously a fan of the 1932 movie, The Most Dangerous Game.In the same way that he created nervous claustrophobia around the Nakatomi Plaza in Die Hard, McTiernan floods the movie with an oppressive and twitchy atmosphere. Half of the film's ominous tone comes from Alan Silvestri's militaristic and primeval score, with pounding drums and lurking strings, indicating that the Predator's haunting presence is everywhere. He could strike from any corner at any moment. And he does.Nothing Dutch and his men seem to do can thwart this enemy and in no time at all Dutch is the last one standing. He runs for his life with the Predator in hot pursuit.The final act is no doubt the strongest and can even be viewed as a separate movie altogether. McTiernan ditches the lush, steamy jungle from the first two acts and completely turns it around into a strikingly Gothic, baroque, supernatural landscape. There is a subtext of primitive brutality winning over highly advanced super-weapons. And there is enough testosterone between Dutch and the Predator to fill 100 tanker trucks. Women, totally, need not apply.Definitely one of Arnie's best and a landmark action movie. No doubt. Outdone only by the sequel.Note When the Predator rises out of the lake and tries to locate Arnie, who is covered in mud, he notices a monkey sitting on a log. Freeze frame the film when he zooms in and you will see a single frame shot of a man in a white vest with an explosion\/lens flare behind. It looks like a shot from Die Hard (which wasn't made at the time!) and I have no clue how it got in there.Weird huh?

I prefer this to Zefferelli's Hamlet even though I think that Gibson's portrayal was much better than Branagh's. (They were trying to do different things with the characters however.)

The tag line proclaims Rush Hour as The fastest hands in the East meets the biggest mouth in the West, and then actually follows through on that promise. Tucker is nowhere near as annoying as he was in Money Talks (1997), and he works well with Chan, at one point holding one hand in his while using the other to hold his own against more than a few baddies. He is certainly a better partner than Danny Aiello made in Chan's last US film (1985's ill-advised The Protector). Chan is also in good form, doing much more than would be expected from him in an American film under an American director. True - he never does any major stunts, but I'll watch the man shimmy up a wall any day (and there are several terrific variations on this theme throughout the movie). The only negative thing I can say is that the camera needed to be back a bit during action sequences. Jackie moves fast enough; the camera shouldn't have to. This made it difficult at times to see who was doing what to whom.  In short, Rush Hour is terrific fun, and it will do just fine until Drunken Master 2 is released here in the States.
