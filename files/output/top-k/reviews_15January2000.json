This remake of the 1968 film that starred Steve McQueen is about a multigabillionaire investment banker who happens to be an art thief.  Well, he's struck again, and it's up to the luscious Rene Russo (as an insurance investigator) to catch the thief.Similarities to the more recent Entrapment abound - in that one, Sean Connery was the suave rich fella with an eye for art, and Catherine Zeta-Jones was the sexy insurance investigator. The problem with that film might have been the romance between Zeta-Jones and Connery, who easily is old enough to be her grandfather. In this film, the two characters appear to rather close in age, so at least that quibble doesn't exist.So let's see what we have. We know right from the beginning that Crown has stolen yet another priceless work of art, so that bit of suspense is gone. And we know that our friendly neighborhood insurance investigator (did you know they can be sexy, too? Who knew?) will nab him not by catching him in the act but by - ahem - pretending to fall for him so she can learn his methods and turn him in as an insider. When you know your 'good guy' is willing to risk it all to get her man, you know her credibility is shot. The chances of her keeping her head above water and not falling for him are incredibly slim, and we know that as the movie progresses we'll see Crown as less of a thief and more of a victim. Ho-hum.Now that I've blasted the script, let's look at the actors' work. Brosnan plays Crown pretty much the way you'd expect him to - aloof, cunning, intelligent - kind of like a James Bond Lite. He doesn't bring a whole lot of excitement to the role, other than the fact that he's Pierce Brosnan. As far as Russo goes - well, she did several inexplicable gratuitous nude (topless, anyway) scenes in this film. Now, sometimes gratuitous nudity is okay in my book - it can distract you from an otherwise dull film. But it seems to me the only reason Russo - an accomplished actress - would consent to showing her breasts is to demonstrate she's not bad-looking ... for a woman in her forties. Other than for vanity reasons, there's no reason in the world for her to get naked. (And for what it's worth, I kind of wish Catherine Zeta-Jones had done the same in Entrapment!)For me, this movie wasn't even good as escapist fare. Quite frankly, a suspense movie with no suspense has little going for it, although the lush production locations did ease the boredom a little.

Then there are films that you see because you know that they will not be around at the theatre for very long.  Last year I saw a fine film called Something More that was a sweet film about the perils of dating in the 30 something age group.  It had a cast of relative unknowns but it looked, for lack of a better word, nice.  It was quite the film and after I saw it, it abruptly left the theater about a week later.  Cider House Rules may last longer than Something More, but not much.  It too is a sweet film that doesn't boast of a huge cast.  Let's face it, Tobey Maguire and Clarize Theron are not on the A-list of actors that can open a film.  Maguire is probably best known for his stint in Pleasantville and Theron is gorgeous and probably known maybe for her role in Mighty Joe Young.  Not huge hits by any stretch but together in this film they are wonderful.  Michael Caine is always terrific in almost every film he chooses ( we'll forgive him for Jaws 4 ) and here he even pulls off a Maine accent quite well.  But CHR is not the type of film that is going to make 100 million at the box office and bring in droves of people.  But what it is, is a great character study of one character named Homer Wells and it is also a story about finding out who you are, even if that means making mistakes.  After all, how are you supposed to learn if not by trial and error?  It is also a film that tells us that sometimes what we think we know isn't always the truth.  As one of the characters in Secret of My Success said,  There are no right and wrongs, only opinions. The richness of the film stems from the screenplay, which was written by Irving himself, and the actors that portray his characters.  As I said, Tobey Maguire is a great young actor and you can see his ability shine through here.  He is not over the top in any of scenes and sometimes it may seem as though he is very comatose in certain scenes, but then you watch a bit more and realize that he is his character.  Homer Wells is exactly the way Maguire plays him.  He is always thinking, always wondering and always perhaps a step ahead of the other people in his life and Maguire's perfect interpretation of him is one of the best performances of the year.  I would love to see him get a nomination this year for best actor, but that is a tough field already.  Clarize Theron shows great range as well and Erika Badyhu is quite good as Rose Rose, the daughter of Mr. Rose.  He is played by Delroy Lindo.  You may remember him from Ransom with Mel Gibson.  In this film he is perfect.  This is a man many layers to him.  At first you love him then you don't like him so much.  But that would be too easy.  I think the screenplay paints this man with many shades of gray.  And we are left to decide at the end of the film how we feel about him.  What I enjoyed most about the film was showing how people are people and that we all make mistakes.  The seduction of flesh and power of love are hard to ignore, no matter how loyal you may feel to one person.  It's funny, in some ways I can draw parallels to this film and Magnolia.  Both try to tell us that human beings are fragile and mistake prone.  We all sin and perhaps we all have to pay for those sins somehow.  But the difference between this film and the obnoxious, smash mouth Magnolia is that this says it in a way that doesn't annoy us or make us want to rip the projector out and set it a blaze.  Magnolia made me angry, Cider House Rules touched me and made me happy.  It made me think a great deal as I left the theater.  It also showed me that it is okay to make mistakes.

Spencer Tracy was also good and, while I did think Katharine Hepburn was better, Tracy also did well.

There was a point trying to be made by having her in it but it just did not get through to me. She was wasted. I can understand why people love this film. It was original in it's time and covered a new subject that was concerning people and it is good if a subject such as inter-ratial marriages is brought to film.

It is a refreshing departure from her roles in such feel-good films as Heathers and Reality Bites.  All kidding aside, this character was tailor-made for Ryder (she has a personal understanding of the subject matter having checked herself into a clinic at age 20 to deal with her anxiety), who was single-handedly responsible for bringing this story to the screen.

Seeing a movie hyped on a tenuous Tarantino link (He's executive producer) actually stopped me watching this film until seven years after it's initial release.Not that I'm anti-Quentin - far from it - but I just thought that any film which uses his name alone (often larger in print than that of the writer\/director or stars) has got to be lacking worth. As it turns out, Killing Zoe doesn't need what seems like a desperate advertising ploy as it can more than stand on it's own merits.Avary, of course, devised one of the three Pulp Fiction vignettes, and anyone who wonders whether his talent for cinema would match or eclipse Quentin's will find their answer here. For my vote, he doesn't. Zoe is a good film, well-shot but ultimately lacking in substance. Arguably the biggest mistake is for the Hollywood values of the movie to tackle French cinema at it's own game. Where Quentin politely borrowed one or two directorial licks from the continent, Avary attempts to carve his own `foreign' movie with long shots, overhead zooms and sustained dialogue. Most notably, there is a fifteen-minute sequence during the bank raid where the dialogue is almost wholly in French with subtitles. However, where the wonderful French film industry could draft a picture around two people having a cup of tea (and the outstanding Trois Couleurs Rouge was about to resustain it's industry just a year later), the old American style of cinema crashes through the attempted mystique by having bodies writhing in slow motion to the sound of bullets. A man being machine-gunned to death is still a man being machine-gunned to death whether or not he's using subtitles to choke out his final death rattle. Also on the theme of ill-judged art is the sex scene that is acted out to images of Nosferatu and the swirling screens of drug use. Drug use is another negative point about this movie it's application is almost wholly without comment or implication. These junkies don't die as a result of it, they don't suffer mental traumas because of it, they just DO it. The leader, the most promiscuous heroin user, is identified as HIV, but this seems more of a lazy justification of what seems to be cool behaviour in a heist movie. Quentin's work is shot through with moral and religious ambiguities, there is none of that here.The three main characters all have their merits &#150; Julie Delpy and Jean-Hughes Anglade do extremely well in their parts, particularly Anglade's increasingly psychotic Eric. Stoltz is the misfit in all this, the token American used to anchor a very continental film back to it's US base. The rest of the characters, meanwhile, are largely faceless and we learn little of them. I loved Gary Kemp's Oliver, who bores the others with his anecdotes during the preparation for the bank robbery. But for the rest, one owns a monkey, one is the coward, one is bald and the other is a token Asian, that's about it. In reviewing this film I appear to have highlighted negative aspects. Far from it, it is a decent, well-made, competently acted and written film. But it's place in film history will never allow it to achieve it's full potential. Shot in the style of East Europe, it carries the style but lacks the full content, meaning that it will never satisfy the audiences of the movies it semi-successfully tries to ape. Conversely, its ponderous, distractedly-framed scenes meant it never made a wide impact in English-speaking countries. Finally, the Quentin connection. As the packaging of this film goes to prove, it is coasted largely on the back of Tarantino's name. While Killing Zoe is a fine film in it's own right, it lacks the cleverly mundane dialogue, intertextuality or moral subtexts of it's most famous peer.

As it turns out, Killing Zoe doesn't need what seems like a desperate advertising ploy as it can more than stand on it's own merits.Avary, of course, devised one of the three Pulp Fiction vignettes, and anyone who wonders whether his talent for cinema would match or eclipse Quentin's will find their answer here. For my vote, he doesn't. Zoe is a good film, well-shot but ultimately lacking in substance. Arguably the biggest mistake is for the Hollywood values of the movie to tackle French cinema at it's own game. Where Quentin politely borrowed one or two directorial licks from the continent, Avary attempts to carve his own `foreign' movie with long shots, overhead zooms and sustained dialogue. Most notably, there is a fifteen-minute sequence during the bank raid where the dialogue is almost wholly in French with subtitles. However, where the wonderful French film industry could draft a picture around two people having a cup of tea (and the outstanding Trois Couleurs Rouge was about to resustain it's industry just a year later), the old American style of cinema crashes through the attempted mystique by having bodies writhing in slow motion to the sound of bullets. A man being machine-gunned to death is still a man being machine-gunned to death whether or not he's using subtitles to choke out his final death rattle. Also on the theme of ill-judged art is the sex scene that is acted out to images of Nosferatu and the swirling screens of drug use. Drug use is another negative point about this movie it's application is almost wholly without comment or implication. These junkies don't die as a result of it, they don't suffer mental traumas because of it, they just DO it. The leader, the most promiscuous heroin user, is identified as HIV, but this seems more of a lazy justification of what seems to be cool behaviour in a heist movie. Quentin's work is shot through with moral and religious ambiguities, there is none of that here.The three main characters all have their merits &#150; Julie Delpy and Jean-Hughes Anglade do extremely well in their parts, particularly Anglade's increasingly psychotic Eric. Stoltz is the misfit in all this, the token American used to anchor a very continental film back to it's US base. The rest of the characters, meanwhile, are largely faceless and we learn little of them. I loved Gary Kemp's Oliver, who bores the others with his anecdotes during the preparation for the bank robbery. But for the rest, one owns a monkey, one is the coward, one is bald and the other is a token Asian, that's about it. In reviewing this film I appear to have highlighted negative aspects. Far from it, it is a decent, well-made, competently acted and written film. But it's place in film history will never allow it to achieve it's full potential. Shot in the style of East Europe, it carries the style but lacks the full content, meaning that it will never satisfy the audiences of the movies it semi-successfully tries to ape. Conversely, its ponderous, distractedly-framed scenes meant it never made a wide impact in English-speaking countries. Finally, the Quentin connection. As the packaging of this film goes to prove, it is coasted largely on the back of Tarantino's name. While Killing Zoe is a fine film in it's own right, it lacks the cleverly mundane dialogue, intertextuality or moral subtexts of it's most famous peer. The film works solely on a surface level, and concludes with all strings neatly tied up at the end. This straightforward practise ultimately means that while entertaining, Killing Zoe leaves nothing behind.

The best film of 1999 is Being John Malkovich.  But this movie is something that blew me away, even more than American Beauty.  I wish I could explain the plot to you, but that would take away from the experience of the movie.  I saw this movie for the first time last Thursday at 1035, and I did not realize it was a three hour plus movie, not including previews.  I would not have seen it then, and probably should have left the theater to go to bed.  But I watched the whole movie, it was that good.I saw it again one week later.  It was just as good.  I have thought about this movie extensively since I first saw it, and still have more thinking to do.  The best part of this movie is that it is not quite as obvious as American Beauty, nor does it examine the exact same topics.  The movie is more about image, self-image, treatment, and truth.  It is about mainly self-centered people.  And, it is mainly a downer of a movie.  The movie has hilarious moments, and moments that just break your heart at the same time. However, even though the length may scare some people away, those who see this movie should stay for the end of it.  The ending, although trite and easily stamped together, seems to be pure genius.  It wraps everything up, and does not let you forget anything.The only problem is that it seems that one story was cut out of the movie for length.  There was a story with Marcie that just never comes back.  Magnolia give it the first scene, but eventually you never see or hear from the characters again.  Is this because the cop never hears about the story again, and we are supposed to be relating to the cop?  Or is it just character development?  I think that much of it was cut to shrink the film.  I hope they place this in the DVD special features.The rest of the movie kept me glued to the screen, and it never gets boring.  Magnolia never lets you get bored of a single story by taking you from a story for lengths of time then bringing you back.  It is just the best thing about the movie.Quite a few people may have problems with the language in the film.  The F-word is used incessantly because these people are not refined.  None of the characters are too educated or intelligent with the exception of the people who don't swear.  You will notice it in the movie.  Otherwise, this is a movie which has inspired me.  It has inspired me to choose my life, and to choose wisely.  This movie is not for people who do not have the attention span nor the capacity to view many intertwining stories.  There are so many to keep track of that many will be lost, and hate the movie. But, this is one of th few movies that I have had interesting conversations about.  You can talk about the results, motivations, characterizations, and actions of all of the people in the movie.  Watch it to try it. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 January 2000","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  This is my favorite movies in movie theaters right now.

This is what they call a real sleeper  smart, funny, filled with heart, and genuinely uplifting.The film, written by David Howard and Robert Gordon, takes off from one of those so-simple-it's-brilliant premises.  A group of squabbling stars from a long-cancelled schlock sci-fi TV series called Galaxy Quest are contacted by a group of real aliens.  They have seen the TV shows, which they believe are historical documents, and have created an entire culture based around Galaxy Quest and its teachings.  They are, in essence, the ultimate Trekkies, and they need help defending themselves against an evil group of lizard-like alien pirates.  There's just one problem  they don't know the actors are just actors.Fortunately, however, everything in their culture, having been based on the show, works just like it does on the show, and the actors find themselves surprisingly able to ease into this world.  And as they face off against the evil beings for the fate of their new interstellar friends, they find themselves falling back in love with the roles they had grown to despise.Galaxy Quest is a film that rewards quick ears.  Its best punchlines are often thrown out as asides.  The film is very savvy about the logic of science fiction, and uses this to create a number of terrific jokes, as well as a credible and entertaining sci-fi plot.  Much credit must go to the actors, who inhabit their roles with effortless panache.  Special shout-outs to Sam Rockwell, as a loser who played a nameless cannon-fodder crew member in one episode of the show, and Alan Rickman, as a classically trained thespian mortified that he has been typecast as a sci-fi alien, and who keeps letting his irritated-actor persona peek out from behind his alien-doctor facade. The director, Dean Parisot, effectively creates affection for these losers who have forgotten the need for heroes, and have their faith in themselves restored by beings who need them to be  the heroes they've believed them to be...and give them the means to do so.The laughs are what will draw many people to see Galaxy Quest, but I think many people will be surprised by the genuine heart at the core of this film.  It's a picture that loves sci-fi and the people who love it, and it understands that Trekkies and other obsessive sci-fi fans are not desperate losers grasping onto a fictional world.
