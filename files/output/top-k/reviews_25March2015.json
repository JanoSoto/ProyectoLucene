I just don't get what anyone sees in this film. The story is basically about a bunch of unhappy people that can't get a handle on their relationships, are all either cheating on each other, screwing up their marriages or plain unpleasant. Mickey (Edward Burns) has recently gotten married to Hope (Maxine Bahns) because he's insecure about his previous girlfriend\/fiancé cheating on him. His brother Francis (Mike McGlone) is cheating on his wife (Jennifer Aniston) with the woman who broke Mickey's heart, Heather (Cameron Diaz). Giving them both lousy advice is their sexist father Frank (John Mahoney), whose wife is alive but never appears on-screen.Admittedly, there are a few laughs here and there. There's a good bit where Ed Burns' character has to convince multiple people that he isn't gay and I thought that was funny. The film is well acted with some good dialog, which I also appreciate. What I didn't like was that the story focuses mostly on depressing, unlikeable people that try and solve their petty problems in the worst ways possible. You might be thinking that bad people trying to solve their problems and failing sounds funny, and it would be&#x85;but it's never done in the far-out way you would expect in a comedy. What we have here is more of a bunch of childish immature attempts that you would find Infuriating in real life, and not the least bit amusing on-screen. When I saw the two brothers settle an argument in an incredibly immature way that it isn't even clever because it ends in a tired joke you can see coming a mile away, I grew irritated. I know I was SUPPOSED to find it funny, but I simply did not. All of the men in the film are insecure and all of the women are frustrated and unhappy in their relationships. This would be fine if you saw them change and evolve. If you find a character annoying from the start though, he or she will be just as annoying at the end of the film. I just found it incredibly hard to cheer or be interested in these characters when they don't feel like real people; they don't really seem to have dreams or ambitions and can barely deal with the situation they've been given. It gets dull following them drift aimlessly.I'm certain that there's some kind of audience for this picture and no matter how many times I've seen it, I can never see the appeal.

A veritable concoction of various genres and emotional textures, this exciting black-and-white cold war thriller never flags for an instant. The sordid tale gets off to an early start a small American patrol is captured during the Korean War by Communists, bent on dominating the uppermost echelons of American politics. Whisked off to Communist China, the platoon becomes subject to brainwashing techniques that wipe their conscious memory and plant a cover story for Staff Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), the man chosen to be a sleeper assassin. Shortly thereafter, he is seen being welcomed home in Washington as a Congressional Medal of Honor winner for his gallantry. The platoon members are soon haunted by dreams that reveal the truth of what occurred though decorated as such, Shaw isn't the hero who saved their lives; rather, he's just another victim of a terrible, traumatic violation. The platoon's commander, Captain Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra) senses something amiss and, determines to unravel the seemingly vicious conspiracy. Meanwhile, Shaw plays his part, manipulated by Soviet agents and his coldly calculating mother (Angela Lansbury &#x96; motivated by her husband's political agenda) as the plot he's been programmed to carry out draws closer to fruition. The captain's subsequent pursuit of the truth comprises the unusual plot which takes us from the halls of Congress to a stunning climax at a Madison Square Garden political convention. Angela Lansbury, as the scheming, caustic mother is sinfully captivating while Laurence Harvey is pitch-perfect as the docile, disturbed son\/war-hero. Sinatra along with the rest of the secondary cast is never less than effective. Frankenheimer's direction is nothing short of masterful, achieving maximum subversion of the audience with a blend of unsettling compositions and fly-on-the-wall photography. The quick cuts and tricky juxtaposition of scenes match the flamboyance of the script. Especially brilliant are the dream sequences that toggle between objective and subjective points of view on the brainwashing demonstration. The political paranoia may, at first glance, seem far-fetched, but when you figure that reality is just as bizarre, you realize the story's sobering clairvoyance.The fascinating thing is that, from uncertain premise to shattering conclusion, one does not question plausibility the events being rooted in their own cinematic reality. Chilling in the extreme, The Manchurian Candidate is a sensational paranoid thriller a lurid tale of high-level subterfuge, depicting, in unflinching detail, the beginning of the end for post-war American optimism.

The perspective of the movie makes it look like the person who is committing murder, 'in the name of God', look like a total lunatic who is off the walls insane. And at the same time this possible 'hero' is willing to sacrifice his relationship with his son for the man upstairs. Is it worth it? That's just one of the many questions Frailty poses through its dark and tormented story. Frailty has an overall bittersweet feeling, on one hand the father is supposedly ridding the world of demons, but at the cost of losing his son. But what makes the movie so effective is that it is told from the perspective of the son who doubts his father and has no one to turn to for help....not even God. There is something harrowing about having Frailty being told through the eyes of a helpless child, it's basically brilliant. In doing so it takes away the fall back that most movies fail to mention, adults, they become 'useless' in a sense because they fail to understand or see what truly is happening to the child. This is something that feels painfully real, how many adults would honestly listen to a child that age, saying the things he says and actually believe him over his father?

Several times during the film, Clooney and company will be standing in a circle and the vampires will just wait to be attacked several times so don't expect to ever feel worried about a character dying that you care about (mainly because you are not given much reason to care about them anyway). The band of vampires continues to play songs while everyone is brawling, and somehow a green blade made Tarantino turn into a vampire.The second half of this movie plays out like a sci-fi channel movie, and the first half plays out like a Tarantino film, with much thanks to Tarantino himself for that. The big picture is that the film is largely forgettable due to its change in tone for the second half.

All of those elements make Friday The 13th Part 2 a worthy sequel to the original and one of the best in the series.Set five years after the original,Friday The 13th Part 2 tells the story of a group of young Camp counselors who are working at a new camp that's right next to Camp Crystal Lake(aka Camp Blood)and are being stalked by Jason Voorhees(Warrington Gillette)the son of Mrs. Voorhees(Betsy Palmer). Lurking and watching in the woods,Jason is going to give the group of Camp Counselors an unlucky,bloody and violent night they will never ever forget. After the Box Office success of the first Friday The 13th in 1980,the sequel Friday The 13th Part 2 was released a year later and was not only a Box Success but introduced audiences to one of the most iconic and memorable characters in the history of not only Horror Movies but film in general in the form of Jason Voorhees who's reign of terror would start with this film. Friday The 13th Part 2 is a great sequel that is such an entertaining and thrilling roller coaster ride that takes some of the elements in the original(camp setting,kills etc)and builds on them with ease and gives viewers an intense,suspenseful film. The scares and suspense in Friday The 13th Part 2 are well done with wonderful pacing and is very much like the original with terror coming and going with non-stop intensity that just grabs viewers by the throat whether it's the Jason POV shots,chase scenes or kills. Despite being one of the brightest looking movies in the entire series(especially during the daytime scenes)the atmosphere in F13 pt 2 is still pretty effective and creepy and gives viewers a sense of dread and fright where you feel like no one is safe from Jason's wrath and carnage. The Kills and gore in the film are creative,memorable and are among the best in the series with two killing scenes that are some of the most iconic of the franchise. The big chase scene is one of the best chase scenes in the in the franchise because there is tons of terror and fright that never stops and viewers won't be able to hold your breath. F13 P2 maybe one of the shortest films in the series(at 87 minutes)it's one of the most memorable. While the character Jason Voorhees makes his first appearance in this film he actually does well with a combination of being scary and at times clumsy(in a funny way). In this film(and three and four)Jason acts more like backwoods hillbilly and hermit wearing overalls and a potato sack on his head(no Hockey mask in this one) as an outcast of society and a demented killer. What also makes Jason great in this one is that we rarely see him until the very end because we only see his feet,hands or see him lurking in the background hiding out in the shadows waiting to kill and strike at anytime. As a result Jason isn't the Hockey Mask wearing antihero and star he became in the later sequels but Part 2 is still Jason at his very best. As for the other characters with the exception of the one main character Ginny(Amy Steel)none of the other characters while interesting aren't well-developed and let's face it the campers are just there to be in Jason's brutal slaughterhouse of death and pain. The ending of Friday The 13th Part 2 is great and filled with suspense and excitement but has caused debates and confusion among fans of the series over whether the ending really happened,did not happen or was a dream or not with no easy answers. A great ending.The cast is good. Amy Steel is wonderful and memorable as Ginny,with Steel bringing depth,courage and dimension to the role making Ginny one of the best final girls in the series. John Furey is good as Paul,Ginny's boyfriend. Warrington Gillette is fantastic as Jason,with Gillette being menacing and creepy. Martha Kober(Sandra),Tom McBride(Mark),Bill Randolph(Jeff),Lauren-Marie Taylor(Vickie),Stu Charno(Ted),Kristen Baker(Terry),Russell Todd(Scott)and Jack Marks(The Cop)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for appearances by actors from the first Friday The 13th such as Adrienne King(Alice),Betsy Palmer(Mrs. Voorhees)and Walt Gorney(Crazy Ralph).The direction by Steve Miner is great,with Miner always moving the camera and giving the film a good pace,style and atmosphere. Solid direction,Miner.The score by Harry Manfredini is terrific,suspenseful and adds to the film. Another wonderful score,Manfredini.The Special Make-up Effects by Carl Fullerton are impressive,bloody and memorable.

The film has so many plot holes in it I actually lost count. Now before I start this review, I'm not going to say toys talking is a plot hole, the idea of them talking is interesting but it opens up so many other questions that the movie never really explains. Also, don't argue, it's a kids movie, films need to make sense in order to work whether they're for kids or not. This film is so bad and here is why. Even if you like this film, you have to agree with some of the points I'm making hereBuzz thinks he's a space ranger. If that is the case then why does he allow Andy to play with him? Does he not think why is this giant kid picking me up and throwing me around? Buzz however makes no attempt to communicate with Andy. Surely Buzz would try and talk to him? This doesn't make sense given that Buzz doesn't believe he's a toy. Also when Woody hits a button that release Buzz's helmet and he gasps for air, you're telling me Andy never pushed that button? He's owned the toy for weeks yet hadn't pressed all the buttons? Rubbish.The end scene is one of the worst scenes for me. It's broad daylight and two toys are running down a street. Where are all the pedestrians on the street? How are they able to open the back of the moving van truck? Surely the driver would notice doesn't he check his rear view mirrors, or surely a button or signal would come up revealing that a door was open at the back of his truck? Wow any thief could steal from this useless driver. Also when Woody and Buzz fly down from the sky and land in Andy's car. Andy's car is directly in front of the truck driver, how could he possibly not see this???The most hilarious scene though is when Woody is moving around in the middle of the road and a person in a car honks at him. Woody then ducks in front of the car as it drives over him. 1) Why would you sound your car horn if there was a toy in the road? 2) The driver therefore saw Woody as he sounded his horn. 3) He must have seen Woody moving about and be thrown from the moving van. Does this driver know toys are alive or something? Is it only kids who are unaware? I just don't understand. It's never fully explained. Continuing this point when the toys all surround Woody and prepare to attack him after he knocks Buzz out the window, we hear Andy from outside shouting. This allows them to return into position. What if he hadn't have shouted though? He would have walked in and seen them. This is why this idea of toys coming to life could never work! No kid would always shout when they enter their room and most kids leave their doors open yet Andy never does - allowing the toys to move around and communicate.Once you take these plot holes into account, the conclusion is that the film sucks and is a really poor movie. Honestly how could anyone like it? An interesting idea that just falls flat. And also the final question that is never addressed is Why can't toys reveal they're alive to humans??? It's never explained and I don't get why. Poor film 1 star. Awful.

Even if you like this film, you have to agree with some of the points I'm making hereBuzz thinks he's a space ranger. If that is the case then why does he allow Andy to play with him? Does he not think why is this giant kid picking me up and throwing me around? Buzz however makes no attempt to communicate with Andy. Surely Buzz would try and talk to him? This doesn't make sense given that Buzz doesn't believe he's a toy. Also when Woody hits a button that release Buzz's helmet and he gasps for air, you're telling me Andy never pushed that button? He's owned the toy for weeks yet hadn't pressed all the buttons? Rubbish.The end scene is one of the worst scenes for me. It's broad daylight and two toys are running down a street. Where are all the pedestrians on the street? How are they able to open the back of the moving van truck? Surely the driver would notice doesn't he check his rear view mirrors, or surely a button or signal would come up revealing that a door was open at the back of his truck? Wow any thief could steal from this useless driver. Also when Woody and Buzz fly down from the sky and land in Andy's car. Andy's car is directly in front of the truck driver, how could he possibly not see this???The most hilarious scene though is when Woody is moving around in the middle of the road and a person in a car honks at him. Woody then ducks in front of the car as it drives over him. 1) Why would you sound your car horn if there was a toy in the road? 2) The driver therefore saw Woody as he sounded his horn. 3) He must have seen Woody moving about and be thrown from the moving van. Does this driver know toys are alive or something? Is it only kids who are unaware? I just don't understand. It's never fully explained. Continuing this point when the toys all surround Woody and prepare to attack him after he knocks Buzz out the window, we hear Andy from outside shouting. This allows them to return into position. What if he hadn't have shouted though? He would have walked in and seen them. This is why this idea of toys coming to life could never work! No kid would always shout when they enter their room and most kids leave their doors open yet Andy never does - allowing the toys to move around and communicate.Once you take these plot holes into account, the conclusion is that the film sucks and is a really poor movie. Honestly how could anyone like it? An interesting idea that just falls flat. And also the final question that is never addressed is Why can't toys reveal they're alive to humans??? It's never explained and I don't get why. Poor film 1 star. Awful.

It's a cute film with the central theme - never give up. Dirk Benedict does an OK job as the father who moves his family to the Alaskan wilderness. This role was no stretch - he basically flies a plane and acts hurt, with brief interlude of arguing with his son. Sean, his son, has the typical teenage angst of not being happy in his own skin, while his daughter Jessie adapts seamlessly to her new environment.I love the cinematography of beautiful Alaskan landscapes. Even more amazing is that the kids, Thora Birch and Vincent Kartheiser, do all their outdoors stunts, like sea kayaking thru rapids, rock climbing, and mountaineering. The flight scenes are exquisite. It's been almost 20 years since this 1996 film was made - I wonder how much of the glaciers in this film are left. Charlton Heston is the bad guy, and makes you laugh when he has to pretend he is not into guns. By far, the little bear Cubby, is the star. He plays a key role throughout.Just put reality into the background when you think about two kids doing what these kids did and how they did it, with their background. It's an enjoyable non-reality ride that will leave you happy and content. That should be enough for you and your family. Kids will enjoy this a lot.

In most of the film, you can see that Kelly uses 2 and 3 technicolor, for example, when John and Kathy are on the roof top, as Kathy is on the ladder. Also, in the short films that the actors in the movie are watching, you can see that tint is being used. Kelly uses a flashback technique in the beginning to focus on how John and Lena met.

I got a very upset stomach when John Hurt's character had an alien bulging through his chest. I knew the iconic scene before viewing the movie, but actually watching the film made it affect me so much more. I also nearly had a headache towards the conclusion when there were strobe lights flashing in order to build the tension for the climax. This is strange and impressive because my body usually does not respond to films that much, even in the body genres.I watched this in a science-fiction film class, but we were discussing it and it is almost ambiguous as to whether this film more readily fits into the sci-fi or horror genre. The heavily black mise-en-scene would point to horror, but the ideas of aliens and robots easily puts this film into the sci-fi genre.The pace of this film is very peculiar to me. On one hand, it is particularly slow towards the beginning of the film, which made it enjoyable as a faster-paced film once the conflict with the titular alien arises, but this fast pace almost skipped information in my opinion. What I noticed was that once the alien starts attacking the various crew members, the members would die, but then the film would quickly cut to the characters back at the safe part of the ship either discussing the death or holding something the character had on him\/her right before they died. These quick cuts imply that the characters found the bodies and returned without trouble; wouldn't it make more sense to show them going to find the bodies to build even more suspense since the audience would question whether the alien moved on or not? Isn't it possible the alien would still be with the bodies?After a lot of exposition, a face-hugger clamps itself onto the John Hurt character, and while Ripley wants to leave him in order to follow protocol, the audience wants to see them take care of the man; all of the audience except me, that is. I know the alien needs to get onto the ship in order for the film to have relevance as a horror film, but I found Ripley's reasoning to be past logical - it's the only reaction that makes sense, but I guess we want to see people sticking out for each other, so the alien gets on board. Thanks Ash, you company man cyborg.Other than these complaints I have, this film does an excellent job at evoking bodily responses which makes for a fun, yet unsettling, experience. I can't wait to see what comes in store next when we watch Aliens next week.
