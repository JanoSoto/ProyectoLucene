To give the movie a more serious impact, there are also some more serious things going around some of the teammates and other residents. A team captain who doesn't feel appreciated but the mayor. A hockey player who realizes that having sex with to many people has consequences, The wife of the mayor has a secret that her husband ultimately finds out and the friendly assistant of the mayor, who stands up to the people who make fun of his 'Lumberjack' town. The humor combined with the dramatic tint makes this movie excellent for the whole family. Fans of hockey and humor will definitely have a good time watching this. I've learned now that a poster doesn't mean anything. I missed out on a great movie for a long time because of thinking like that. Never again!!!9 out of 10 for this one. Fun fun movie!!!

The other half will say Ghostbusters. This is the kind of a role that one is born to play. Murray plays the character of Phil Conners and does it better than a real Phil Conners would have. His comedic talents are highly honed in this performance and he is working near the top of his game. It is so important to be inside a Phil Conner's head in this movie due to the repetitive nature of the movie. Murray is consistent, funny and just melds with the story line.The story line is pretty basic. Phil Conners is a weatherman on assignment to cover Groundhog Day. He doesn't seem to be a nice man nor does he like his job very much. He mis-predicts the weather and end up getting stuck in Puncsutawney, PA where an annual Groundhog Day event is held putting the whole town on hold. Upon awakening the next morning in Puncsutawney the following day he discovers that it is Groundhog Day all over again. There is a great scene when Murray dresses as a cowboy with a date that is classic; and the way he is able to handle the Brink's guards is also very humorous.Also fun to watch in the movie is the talented Andie MacDowell whose character of Rita is completely unaware that it is the same day for Phil. She tries to understand. Less understanding is Phil's cameraman played by David Letterman funny man Chris Elliot who gives his usual spot on dufus performance. The man who will always be synonymous with the film is Stephen Tobolowsky who plays the knee-slapping funny Ned Ryerson. The scenes, few as they are, with Bill Murray are comedy at its finest and also very Bill Murray. Written by Danny Rubin and directed by Harold Ramis (Murray's co-star in Ghostbusters), this film was almost an experiment to see if Hollywood would let them make a movie in which the characters relive the same day over and over again. There have even been analysis papers written about time travel and how Phill Conners reacts in his environment so as to allow the same actions to take place again the next day. The film really found a cult like following when the replay rights were purchased by Turner Broadcasting and the movie received so much repeat airplay on TBS that some viewers thought they were in the actual movie. Ramis is to be commended for keeping all the scenes and continuity straight even with so many Hollywood tricks he could have chosen to use. This movie has turned out to be an important film of the 1990s. 8\/10** The poster for the film is a little too cutesy and I never thought of this film as cutesy or talking down to the audience.

At first the people think they've found a bargain but soon they start having second thoughts. This here is such a strange film that I can't help but wonder what Eastwood was exactly trying to do with it. Was it a homage to his earlier Spaghetti Westerns with Leone? Was it a spoof of the Western genre? Or was it a mixture of some sort of strange ghost story set in the West? I'm really not sure but it seems to try and mix all three to the point where this is just a downright surreal and at times rather frustrating film. I don't think it's bad film-making but in fact very good film-making because Eastwood never really lets on to what he's trying to do and that's where the film gets most of its power. I personally never saw this as a horror movie, although I know many fans claim that. To me the movie is simply about getting revenge against the so-called bad guys and the so-called good guys hiring the stranger. We even get a rather bizarre rape scene, which usually leads to quite a debate in what exactly it was going for. Was it saying women enjoy rape? Again, I'm not sure but this is a scene that's pretty ugly yet Eastwood follows it up with a hilarious scene of the woman seeking revenge while he's taking a bath. The strange mixture of seriousness, drama and then comedy makes for one strange film but the director and star does a fine job handling the subject even though I think the movie begins to lose some of its steam towards the end. Eastwood the actors turns in another fine performance because there aren't too many people who can say so much with such few lines of dialogue.

Is it a boat captain the kids messed with earlier or is it Muffy's evil twin? Even though each year gave us at least a dozen slashers this one here has remained quite popular but controversial at the same time. The reason the film remains a hot topic isn't because of the gore scenes...because there aren't any. The performances, direction and art design aren't the reason people still discuss this movie either. The reason, and you can quit reading here if you haven't seen the movie, is because of the title and the fact that it plays a part in the twist at the end. The film didn't work for me the first time and it didn't improve any on this second viewing even though I was aware of what was happening the entire time. I think the filmmakers thought they were a lot more clever than they actually were and I'd go even further as to say the screenplay can't do enough justice for what they're even attempting to do. I think the biggest problem is that it's so obvious as to what's going on and this isn't helped because the red herring characters are so poorly thrown in our face that it's obvious as to who isn't doing the killings. I think naming the film what they did was another mistake because thing might have worked a lot better had the ending been a secret and the movie didn't make it so obvious. Selling this movie off as a slasher is pretty much a cheat because we don't get any good gore scenes. Again, I know this is part of the joke but it still doesn't work for me. Even while watching the movie if you don't know what's going on you're eventually going to start asking yourself why you're watching a slasher and yet no slashing is going on. One good thing is that the film runs very quickly and the director keeps everything moving at a nice pace. Another plus is some nice humor as the teens start to find various objects to their pass in their rooms. In the end I've always seen this film as a wasted opportunity and I'm saying this knowing that there are fans out there.

This may be because it is a thief movie which the follow on Pink Panther movies are not.This makes it more enjoyable to me since it is not one attempt after another at slapstick but rather, has a feel similar to The Thief Who Came to Dinner or Topkapi. Henry Mancini's music, as when used in the former, gives the tension feel to the serious scenes. But tension has not much of a place in a comedy.Afterwards, the latter movies went to pure comedy, which is okay, but I hardly ever watch them. This is the movie that I return to time after time.

His small, religious town is reading to hang him especially after the religious profit Matthew Brady (Fredric March) arrives on the scene. The teacher's only defense is a reporter (Gene Kelly) and the hard edged lawyer (Spencer Tracy) that his paper has hired. As a film buff the most entertaining thing for me to watch is a great story with great actors giving great performances as they battle against one another. A lot of times courtroom dramas are some of the best examples of this and that holds true here with this masterpiece, which to me is one of the greatest movies ever made. Quite often when I'm asked about some of the greatest performances in history both Tracy and March, from this movie, jump right to my mind. The two men were certainly towards the end of their careers and were already legends by the time this film went into production but I'm really not sure if either one had been better. With so many great performances behind them it's hard to narrow their best down to one but their work here could certainly be debated as their greatest. It's really amazing to see how much life, energy and raw power they bring their characters and watching them battle against one another just leaves me in amazement. Tracy's stern, straight forward performance mixes so well with March's hyped but sometimes comical performance that you can't help but marvel as the brilliance in front of you. I'm not sure if the two men spoke before the big courtroom scene at the end of the movie but it certainly feels like they're both hitting the right notes as they battle back and forth trying to get their feelings across. Kelly is just as impressive in his role and adds a nice comic touch that the film certainly needs. Kelly is very impressive from start to finish as is York as the teacher, Donna Anderson as his girl and Claude Akins as her preacher father. A lot of people bash this movie for being anti-religion but I don't think that's the case at all. I think the movie is about the right to think no matter if you think religion is right or if Darwin was right. I've read that the religious folks here are all crazy or shown in a bad light. Again, I'd disagree by saying fanatics are shown in a bad light or people who don't want others to think on their own are shown in a bad light.

Tracy's stern, straight forward performance mixes so well with March's hyped but sometimes comical performance that you can't help but marvel as the brilliance in front of you. I'm not sure if the two men spoke before the big courtroom scene at the end of the movie but it certainly feels like they're both hitting the right notes as they battle back and forth trying to get their feelings across. Kelly is just as impressive in his role and adds a nice comic touch that the film certainly needs. Kelly is very impressive from start to finish as is York as the teacher, Donna Anderson as his girl and Claude Akins as her preacher father. A lot of people bash this movie for being anti-religion but I don't think that's the case at all. I think the movie is about the right to think no matter if you think religion is right or if Darwin was right. I've read that the religious folks here are all crazy or shown in a bad light.

Director of Photography Joe McDonald, best known for his films noir, shot the gorgeous Niagara Falls locations in dazzling Technicolor, while still making atmospheric, suspenseful use of shadows and light. Even more dazzling is Marilyn Monroe in one of her earliest star vehicles, sultry and slippery in one of her last femme fatale roles before GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES showed the world Monroe's funny side.Despite the happy cliché of Niagara Falls being a honeymooners' paradise, NIAGARA The Movie is moody from the start as edgy George Loomis (Joseph Cotten) wanders around the Canadian side of the falls at dawn, feeling insignificant. He's a war veteran freshly released from an Army hospital, where he was treated for PTSD, or as they called it back then, battle fatigue. He's also got a sexpot wife, Rose (Monroe), so you'd think George's life isn't that bad. -) Ah, but Rose has thorns a secret lover and a plot to kill George and make it look like suicide. Fate brings the Loomises together with Polly and Ray Cutler (Jean Peters and Casey Adams). Polly and Ray are at the falls for their late honeymoon, long delayed by eager-beaver Ray's demanding job as a cereal executive. Despite bringing books, Ray promises, It'll be as good as a regular honeymoon. It should be better, Polly replies teasingly. I've got my union card now. They laugh and snuggle, and that's one of the few happy moments Polly and Ray have together before the Loomises make their honeymoon into a living hell.Things get creepy, starting with small inconveniences, like our lovebirds settling for a cabin with a so-so view because Rose and the unwell George are still in the cabin Polly and Ray were supposed to have. While the Cutlers enjoy their tour of the falls, Polly spies Rose making out with her hunky hottie (Richard Allan, who serves mostly as tasty eye candy). At an outdoor party that evening, Polly all but misses a romantic moment watching the falls' light show with Ray because she's bandaging George's hand after he cuts himself breaking Rose's favorite romantic record in a rage. Rose just sits there and smirks. (Reminded me of the toga party scene in ANIMAL HOUSE when, out of nowhere, John Belushi busts up folkie Stephen Bishop's guitar, then gives it back to him with a deadpan Sorry. -)) Our sympathetic honeymooners get fed up as they're reluctantly pulled deeper into the Loomises' problems, not realizing Rose is setting them up as witnesses to George's increasingly shaky mental state, all the better to make his eventual death look like suicide. Like that's not enough, Ray's ridiculously jolly boss, Mr. Kettering (Don Wilson, from Jack Benny's various shows) and his wife (Lurene Tuttle) show up, eager to sightsee with the Cutlers and schmooze with Ray about giving him a raise because of his prize-winning shredded wheat promotion idea, turning the honeymoon into a busman's holiday. Oy! By now, Polly and Ray have been through the wringer because of those loony Loomises, so I had to smile and sympathize with Ray being, to quote the HIGH NOON theme song, torn 'twixt love and duty, sincerely wanting to take care of his distraught bride, yet reluctant to nix an opportunity to score a raise that would improve their life together in myriad ways. If the 1953 economy was anything like today's economy, I can't blame Polly for agreeing to include face time with the boss as part of their honeymoon itinerary! Peters and Adams make an appealing couple, sweet with a touch of insouciant playfulness. The peripatetic Ray clearly means well and loves Polly. Heck, he doesn't even show any serious lust for the luscious Rose; he just makes good-natured wisecracks about her to Polly, and vice-versa. FTM, I liked how Polly never acted catty or jealous around Rose. Now that's self-confidence! -) As the calculating, manipulative Rose, Monroe smolders like nobody's business, driving men mad with her careless come-hither air and her curves in, as George grouses, a dress cut down so low in front, you can see her kneecaps. La Monroe even gets to sing Kiss (no, not the Prince song), that love song Rose and her secret sweetie like so much. It'll come back to haunt her later, but I don't want to give away the nifty twists! I'll only say that Alfred Hitchcock would have been proud to call the bell tower scene his own (though with his taste in women, I imagine Hitch would have picked a cooler, more subtle blonde than Monroe -)).

This film is certainly a message movie but apparently the cast felt it was an important message to give, which will explain why Tracy, near death, came out of his retirement to do the film. Kramer is best known for his message movies and I think they all hold up incredibly well today because they don't preach to the viewer. This film gives us a situation and lets the viewer pick which side of the fence they are on. Every side of the coin is shown here and discussed at great length and I believe this is why the film still get played on various stations today. It's message is certainly about interracial marriage but I think the film's heart could go towards countless topics. What I love most about the film is that it's rather honest in its approach to the subject and each of the parents, including Poitier's, are given their own opinions on the matter. Whether the people approve or disapprove, they are given a voice and opinion. The film really plays out like a courtroom drama because we're given the case and then hear from both sides until a verdict is finally given in the film. The main joy in watching this film are because of the wonderful performances with Tracy leading the way in his final role. Tracy gets to display a lot of emotions in this film and I must say he nails each of them. It's amazing to know that he was near death yet that didn't stop him from delivering one of the most memorable characters of his career. As was the case with a lot of Tracy performances, he says so much without any dialogue. You can constantly look at his face and just tell that he's thinking. That might sound simple and Tracy makes it look simple but to actual show in on film isn't something too many actors have conquered. I'm guessing that Tracy knew his final speech in the film would be his last time in front of the camera and I can't help but think this added a little extra touch to his performance. His speech is very heartfelt and his remarks towards Hepburn are incredibly touching. Hepburn is also at the top of her game and her expression of shock early on is priceless. Poitier turns in another wonderful performance as does Beah Richards and Roy Glenn as his parents. Isabel Sanford almost steals the film as the family maid who isn't too happy about Poitier dating a white woman.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"3 February 2009","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" You've gotta hand it to Kubrick, the man never sold out, no matter how critically acclaimed his films were and no matter how much attention the film industry has paid to him, the man always worked to achieve perfection in every shot of every minute of every film he made in his forty years or so in the business. Eyes wide shut, his last feature, is a prime example of Kubrick's masterful directorial style, though not as critically acclaimed as other films he made such as 2001, A Clockwork Orange and The Shining, Eyes Wide Shut deserves to be included among these, just showing that right up until the end, Kubrick was still making some of the greatest films ever. Kubrick's direction is unquestionable, everything about this film is pure class, perfect shots, perfect locations, perfect story, and a perfect cast. I was sceptical about Tom Cruise at first, for reasons other than the obvious that according to the IMDb review submission is a prohibited word, but Cruise gives a great performance here, it is a shame he went on to be in such limp efforts as Valkyrie. Having the patience to work with Kubrick does make me respect Cruise more than I did, as it is common knowledge that Kubrick demanded up to 100 takes in some of his picture, explaining why he only released a catalogue of around 15 films over a forty year period. But Cruise's performance here is definitely the high point of his career, especially so in scenes where he has no dialogue, such as the orgy scene. Cruise wandering around the mansion observing depraved sexual acts while the piano instrumentals help add to the mysterious aura. As well as being the high point of Tom Cruise's career, the orgy scene I would say definitely rivals other famous moments in Kubrick's history in film, the camera moving through the house, its just encaptivating. On top of Cruise's performance, all others cast in this film were clearly the only people you could cast in the film, perfect actors on perfect form, all roles were played magnificently, Kidman especially. I was unsure about her performance in the scene about half an hour in where Cruise and Kidman's characters were getting stoned together and arguing, but only to slight extent, throughout the film Kidman's role as Alice, the wife with sexual longings makes the plot all the more interesting, what with Cruise's character Bill's investigation into the orgy. Another noticeable aspect of the film that adds to its impact is the score, the piano based instrumentals serves to add to the tension and the mysterious atmosphere, especially so during the orgy scene. The instrumentals make the film feel dreamlike, its almost as if the viewer is seeing it as though they were stoned. The instrumentals help to suck you into the world of the confused jealous husband, adding to the film's overall impact on the viewer. The film was controversial at the time of release, but let me just say that if you think that sex and nudity detract from the artistic significance of a film, you're a f******g cretin. Some argue that porn is art, and the sex scenes and especially the orgy in Eyes Wide Shut proves this right. The orgy scene may be pretty daring, but that was the brilliance of Kubrick, there are no boundaries, all he cared about was making an amazing film. It really is a shame that Kubrick's gone from the world of cinema. While so many nowadays pander to the hordes of those who wish to see more limp, badly directed tripe such as the alien vs predator films or god forbid movie parodies like disaster movie and s**t like that. With people like Kubrick gone, we've got very few visionaries left. We've still got Lynch, the Coen Brothers, Cronenberg and others, but more and more people flock to features with no heart in them.

Eyes wide shut, his last feature, is a prime example of Kubrick's masterful directorial style, though not as critically acclaimed as other films he made such as 2001, A Clockwork Orange and The Shining, Eyes Wide Shut deserves to be included among these, just showing that right up until the end, Kubrick was still making some of the greatest films ever. Kubrick's direction is unquestionable, everything about this film is pure class, perfect shots, perfect locations, perfect story, and a perfect cast. I was sceptical about Tom Cruise at first, for reasons other than the obvious that according to the IMDb review submission is a prohibited word, but Cruise gives a great performance here, it is a shame he went on to be in such limp efforts as Valkyrie. Having the patience to work with Kubrick does make me respect Cruise more than I did, as it is common knowledge that Kubrick demanded up to 100 takes in some of his picture, explaining why he only released a catalogue of around 15 films over a forty year period. But Cruise's performance here is definitely the high point of his career, especially so in scenes where he has no dialogue, such as the orgy scene. Cruise wandering around the mansion observing depraved sexual acts while the piano instrumentals help add to the mysterious aura. As well as being the high point of Tom Cruise's career, the orgy scene I would say definitely rivals other famous moments in Kubrick's history in film, the camera moving through the house, its just encaptivating.

I love the way he plays the part so natural and I'm glad he doesn't go over the top to get the laughs. Most of the laughs are just genuine little chuckles because the film doesn't try to force the viewer to laugh at stupid set ups but instead just gives us natural laughs as they come across in the story. Tracy does a wonderful job at playing someone who gets in over their head and has to deal with one problem after another while trying to remember that it's all for the good of his daughter. Taylor also shines in her supporting role. Her beauty is certainly on full display but, unlike many stars of today, her talent is also on display. Joan Bennett adds great support as Tracy's wife.

So how do I even start to write a review of a film that I view as one of Hitchcock's best? Well maybe I should just write what I like about it without delving into psycho babble and a deconstruction of the human psyche and all its little offshoots! So I will!.Rear Window is adapted by Alfred Hitchcock and his writer John Michael Hayes, from the Cornell Woolrich story called It Had To Be Murder\/Murder From A Fixed Viewpoint. The film of course forces us the viewers to become voyeurs, watching a newly hooked voyeur go about his business. Quite a neat trick from Hitchcock, and one can reasonably assume that the maestro director was chuckling with glee within his genius girth.Working from the confines of a single set, Hitchcock has molded a suspenseful, intriguing, cheeky and sexy picture, with a top line cast giving the smart screenplay the performances it deserved.

As others have pointed out, this film is not especially plot-oriented, but moves from scene to scene as, plausibly, the transition from training to being stationed to boredom to combat and all the ephemera in between would actually play out for a soldier as subject.Instead, this movie for me functions primarily as a thought experiment. You're young, say 18 years old. You enter the Marines. A thought process, a worldview is imposed onto you. You accept it because you see the harsh consequences that happen to those who resist. You try to maintain individuality throughout, though this is expressed mainly in admissible, largely futile symbolic gestures.Training is over. You live a strangely divorced, comfortable life, stationed in an area where there is a civil war going on and unfortunates on both sides are dying every day. Now and then, you see inexplicable atrocities. When in the midst of them, you do not think of your side's role in creating geopolitical strategems or polemics, or who is right or wrong, or what your country is doing there in the first place, or... any number of possible questions. You understand that for survival's sake, you will function like those around you, serving your side. At this point, you are capable of anything, in the name of your own self-interest.This, it seems to me, the movie believes is the nature of war. The cause may be damnable or noble, but the role of the soldier is the same.

And when one looks upon his motion pictures, such as the infamous Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959), even if you find yourself enjoying the movie as a guilty pleasure, you can easily see why. That's really the only reason why he's famous today and why this Tim Burton biopic was even made. Ed Wood cost more to make than all of the real man's movies put together, but it does do the story justice if it is slightly fictionalized.For those not familiar with the story, Edward D. Wood, Jr. (played by Johnny Depp) was a young transvestite filmmaker during the 50s who was marked by his laughable production values and even more so, his ambition. He stopped at nothing to gain money to make his flicks and also during that time, befriended Dracula (1931) star Bela Lugosi, played here by Martin Landau in a hands-down brilliant performance that won him an Academy Award.There was only one thing I admired about the real Ed Wood and that was his ambition. It was most certainly not his movies. Burton's biopic wonderfully reenacts Wood's passion for movie-making in an inspiring method. Film critic Gene Siskel called Ed Wood one of the year's very best and hoped that it would inspire ambitious filmmakers to follow their dreams. And I could not agree more with him on that regard. I did not like Ed Wood as much as him, but I agree that it is one of the great movies about movie-making.Appropriately, Ed Wood is shot in black-and-white; a brilliant decision since it captured the atmosphere of Wood's scenario and also because it's hard to imagine what Bela Lugosi would have looked like in color seeing as how he passed away before even appearing in one. It gives the movie a documentary-like style, which is also truly effective seeing as how it reflects upon the past. Performances all around are very good, especially Martin Landau. I was truly amazed at how well he mimicked the real Bela Lugosi's accent and mannerisms without becoming unintentionally comical. Johnny Depp was also very good as the optimistic Ed Wood. There are many other famous names in the film such as Bill Murray, but because they play characters exactly opposite of their mainstream course, we buy them for people, which is what any movie should do.Bottom line, Ed Wood is a very good film by Tim Burton. There were some parts, mostly emotional scenes, that I felt were not carried long enough into the running time, but other than that, it is a pretty much flawless and solid Tim Burton movie effectively blending drama and comedy together along with inspiring a new generation of people to take the challenge and follow their dreams of becoming filmmakers.

I was dumb enough (at the age of 10) to rent this movie from a video rental, only to discover that several years later, guess what movie wins? Cool As Ice.Now, if you read my other reviews,you know I can put up with some Bad movies. I've seen Good Burger, Juno, Home Alone 4, Air Buddies, and Cabin Boy, but this one is worse than all of those COMBINED. You can tell this movie is gonna be bad just by the front cover. Half - Jap looking kid has carved words in his chest (supposedly using a knife) while standing in front of the most bland looking girl in the world and a seemingly anorexic fat kid who bears a frightening resemblance to Josh from Drake And Josh. Oh, wait! That is him!The movie is even worse. Some retard kid is picked on my an ever bigger retard who's afraid of a frog that looks like it's from The Kid A Littles. Later on, he sneaks into the junkyard and pours ice cream all over some french guy and Cuba Gooding Jr. Do I need to say more?Anyways, this movie is just BAD BAD BAD. If you want a good bad movie that's actually OK in some parts, rent Good Burger. I mean, come on. It's Keenan and Kel, who can go wrong? ","genre":"Comedy, Crime, Family"}]
