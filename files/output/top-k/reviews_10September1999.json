They are thematically very similar, but where The Sixth Sense approaches the material on tiptoe, whispering, Stir of Echoes hits you over the head with a pickaxe.Both are about a little boy who can see dead people - it's turning into a The Shining - Redux festival.  In Stir of Echoes, the little boy, Jake can see a very particular dead person, a young girl of limited mental capacity who disappeared about 6 months before.  After being hypnotized at a party, his father, played by Kevin Bacon in a stirring performance, can see her too.The look of the movie is dark and creepy from the beginning, and the director manages to maintain that feel even on brightly sunlit afternoons, as when Maggie takes Jake out for a walk in the.... cemetery?   There they meet a big, bald black man, patterned after Dick Halloran in The Shining, who immediately knows the boy has the third eye and suspects that the father must, too. We find out from him that the dead girl wants something, and that Tom will not have peace until she gets it.On cue, Tom is given his task  Dig.  The movie takes the action up a notch with more frequent appearances of the dead girl, as Tom becomes more and more obsessed with his task.  He doesn't know why he's digging, or even where he's supposed to dig, but he pursues his labors with some ardor. Meanwhile the mother, Maggie (played by Kathryn Erbe) through whose able eyes we are meant to watch this story, is getting totally creeped out.  And so are we.I have a real aversion to violence on screen (or in life), and the denouement of this movie is really over the top in that regard.Virtually every performance in this movie is superb.  The little boy (Zachary David Cope) isn't given much to do, except be cute, and rather matter-of-fact about his gift.  Kathryn Erbe is marvelous as the mother, playing the observer of this macabre drama with a perfectly credible mix of indulgence, impatience, worry, fear, and anger. Ileana Douglas does a fine turn as Maggie's sister, a witty and intelligent woman stuck in a world that is too rough for her.Kevin Bacon, rugged and blustering at first, gives us a look at a blue-collar family man who isn't used to seeing quite so much of the world around him, and is not particularly happy about it.  After he is told what part he is to play, he descends into his obsession with a gusto that seems native to a man accustomed to following someone else's orders without questioning.  He doesn't really think about what he's supposed to do, he just does it.  When he finds what he's looking for, his horror is as great as ours.If I didn't have the recent experience of the classier and more tasteful The Sixth Sense to compare it to, this movie would have fared better in my estimation.  Both movies deal with the same subject matter, but The Sixth Sense did it from the perspective of an accomplished psychologist.  It is a film of greater finesse than this gritty, working class take on the afterlife, and its themes are less about violence and retribution than about understanding.

Opinions are extremely divided on this movie, and following are the partial reasons why some don't like it; but ultimately, anyone who claims EYES is a failure is not worth wasting your breath on. If they watched this movie all the way through, and had only negative comments about it, you can be assured that their eyes do not see, and their minds cannot comprehend, brilliance. And I don't mean 'questionable brilliance' as in a sculpture or some other work of art which some claim is a masterpiece and others regard as horrible; I'm talking about palpable, obvious brilliance that anyone who is not a media slave can recognize. Many reviewers, professional and otherwise, claim that EYES didn't 'live up its hype'. These people are merely conformists guided only by what they see and hear on TV. They had false expectations of perhaps a sexy, light drama along the lines of most the other 'married stars' fodder they've been fed in recent years. When EYES turns out to be a daring, deep, esoteric thriller about the darker side of marriage, and very different from any other movie, they feel they've been 'let down'. These people are hopelessly anesthetized by the media, and are better off with Adam Sandler films, when they know what to expect brainless drivel, which fulfills their deep desire to escape from having to use their intelligence. EYES is definitely not a movie for people who really think Sandler comedies are hilarious. Those people need shi* to survive, and there's plenty of it out there for them to roll in. You shouldn't bother them to try to explain EYES, or beseech them to go see it again; this is caviar and they only know oatmeal. In addition to saying it's not what they expected, they're the same people who complain about the 'piano pinging' or call the film 'too weird'. Also, some people have seen Kubrick's previous films, and therefore expected something outrageous, as in Clockwork Orange or Full Metal Jacket. They see EYES as merely a film in which Cruise walks around the streets for the whole movie with few action sequences, they walk out and label the film a failure. They can't appreciate anything but that which holds their interest at the moment. Yet they believe that because they watch Kubrick films, they are on some higher level than Sandler fans. They are wrong. But the most prevalent and disturbing reviewers have been women. Apparently, this masterpiece is completely misunderstood by many women, whose opinions I've heard personally and in print, and without exception are highly critical. The orgy sequence in particular has caused a lot of women to say the film is merely soft porno, and\/or pretentious and unbelievable; and they have misinterpreted (to an amazing degree) the fact that for the most part, only women are naked, and Cruise has no nude scenes. As if Kubrick should have inserted a gratuitous shot of a naked Cruise in order to pacify some really stupid people and 'live up to the hype'. These complaints are just ridiculous and juvenile. In Clockwork Orange, the complaints about excessive misogynistic tendencies were justified none of that stuff was in the book, it was Kubrick's obnoxious way of making the movie 'his'. He was still learning how to translate novels into movies successfully. He  also loved to shock people, but he sometimes lost control of himself in his desire to deviate from the norm. 2001 is the exception to that, and so is EYES, which wraps up Kubrick's career beautifully and shows the brilliance of 2001 was not a fluke. The screenplay faithfully follows a brilliant book that was written decades ago, with some embellishments that add to the cryptic nature of the film, but never sacrifice shock for quality, or obnoxiously force Kubrick's personal beliefs on the viewer, as in Clockwork. EYES is pure art of the highest quality, with absolutely no concessions to studio executives or the many Neanderthals among the moviegoing public who crave the exact same picture over & over. It's a movie for people who like to actually use their brain, and can appreciate such things as cinematography, screenplay, great acting, and virtuoso directing. There are some scenes in EYES which will have your jaw on the floor. If someone feels like walking out or snickering at these scenes, they probably should leave and rent a  Garry Marshall movie, where everything is obvious and condescending, and no thinking is required. If you liked the movie but didn't understand a lot of it, and perhaps were frustrated by that, it's understandable, but don't call the film a failure. You're showing your ignorance. Read Dream Story, available in a book (along with the screenplay) called EYES WIDE SHUT. Many of your questions will be answered. This film is the best Kubrick has done since 2001. All the others in between were interesting and had many assets, but were ultimately flawed by excess and\/or questionable translations by Kubrick from novel to screenplay. EYES does not suffer from that. The translation is excellent and very relevant; Cruise is amazing; the lighting is perfect; the soundtrack is truly spine tingling; and the orgy scene is one of the most incredible scenes in the history of film. In fact, the entire film leaves a haunting feeling. The many Christmas tree lights, the slightly, deliberately off-kilter faux New York sets, and the apartment interiors all add up to a unique after-effect that captures a certain, near-Christmas ambience better than any other film ever did. EYES is to be experienced, not merely seen. And if you know someone who doesn't like it, while you love it, then chances are you have a serious incompatibility with that person, and you should perhaps reconsider whatever you thought about that person's ability to appreciate the finer things in life.

The many Christmas tree lights, the slightly, deliberately off-kilter faux New York sets, and the apartment interiors all add up to a unique after-effect that captures a certain, near-Christmas ambience better than any other film ever did. EYES is to be experienced, not merely seen. And if you know someone who doesn't like it, while you love it, then chances are you have a serious incompatibility with that person, and you should perhaps reconsider whatever you thought about that person's ability to appreciate the finer things in life. EYES WIDE SHUT is that good, and perhaps its brilliance will be realized by more people as time goes on; but I doubt it.

Mars Attacks! was very comical and I seemed to enjoy it more than everybody else did(though I would have liked to see stop-montion flying saucers).But he was born to direct this movie. This movie is so offbeat and so oddly comical it could have only been done by him. And throughout this film you can see clearly that Burton understands Ed Wood. Any other director given this script (and an excellent script it is) would have rewritten and made fun of Ed Wood. They would have scoffed at him and lobotimized the character for laughs. But not Burton. He plays Ed's relationships with the other characters so well. Ed befriending a dying Bela Lugosi is very well done. Not too gushing with emotions but not too rigid, he plays it like they're friends. Bela is played superbly by Martin Landau. Bela knows the movies he's making are not the high quality pieces he was making in the thirties, but he's happy he's getting work and that somebody has faith in him enough to put him in one of their movies.

Catharsis meant the creation of characters whose fear, torment or happiness the audience could identify with.  I disliked PAYBACK because I couldn't identify with any of the characters, and the thing that really scares me is to see how many people did identify with the brutish, nasty little thief who stars in this movie.Porter (Gibson) is a professional criminal who plans a brutal robbery, but finds himself cheated out of his own share of the loot.  Now Porter will very unsubtly go about getting his share of the loot back. Not the whole haul, mind you, but only his own share, the share that he stole fair and square.Don't you know somebody like Porter? Haven't you always wanted to do something like what Porter's doing?  Aren't you itching to find out whether Porter outdoes all his fellow bad guys and gets away with his money?  I don't know about you, but for me the answer is no to all three questions. If Porter were at least intelligent about how he goes about his scheme, he might be worthwhile watching, but in fact his tactics are incredibly dumb and succeed only by fiat of screenwriter and director.  For one example, Porter stupidly gives away his greatest advantage, the fact that his adversaries don't know he's alive.  In another scene, Porter asks a Hulking Tough Dude to show him to his criminal boss.  The Hulking Tough Dude refuses, so Porter rips the HTD's earring out.  The HTD immediately whips out a gun and shoots Porter dead.  No, wait, that's what would really happen.  Because we are living in Hayes\/Abascal\/Helgeland Land, the HTD meekly leads Porter in to see the criminal boss.I have difficulty believing that anything of Brian Helgeland, the screenwriter of the excellent L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, survives in this film, since he was sacked before it was done.  It is much easier for me to blame Terry Hayes, co-writer and author of such stupidity as MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME, and Paul Abascal who was final director.  Whoever may be to blame obviously wanted to take his source material (a Donald Westlake story variously alleged to be either POINT BLANK or THE HUNTER) and turn it into just what we all needed, another take on PULP FICTION.  He got all the bad parts of Tarantino's hit right the mindless, senseless, bloody, and sadistic violence, the characters with no appeal or redeeming features whatsoever, and the darker-than-black humor that generally hurts too much to laugh at.  However, while the dialogue in both films is mostly meaningless, Tarantino's had a spontaneous, natural sound to it; it may have been empty, but it was at least realistic.  Here, the lines sound contrived as well as empty.  Gibson's voice-over narration is omnipresent and irritating, especially when used to reveal points about his character that are already intensely obvious, since there is only one point to his character that he is an unmitigated S.O.B.It takes a lot to earn this disgusting film its one lonely star.  The dark cinematography by Ericson Core conveys the amoral world of Porter convincingly.  Gibson is always watchable, though it's sad to see him play such a one-note role.  (There is a second note, Gibson's romance with Bello, but it's so tacked-on and reeking of cliche that it doesn't count).  Gregg Henry's Val Resnick, the anti-antihero, is appropriately slimy.  Kris Kristofferson plays a character named Bronson who, probably by design, resembles the Bronson we all know and who is vastly more sympathetic than Gibson.  James Coburn reprises his dapper villain role from MAVERICK, which is always fun.  But best of all is Lucy Alexis Liu as Pearl, the sadomasochist to whom all the violence is just a game.These few bright spots failed to distract me from the underlying fact that PAYBACK is a lousy film with a lousy script and at times is damn near unbearable to watch.  The one thing it taught me is a valuable but very disturbing lesson the viewing public has enough sadists who think that screaming, bloody agony is laugh-out-loud hilarious to make dreck like PAYBACK commercially successful.

Not the whole haul, mind you, but only his own share, the share that he stole fair and square.Don't you know somebody like Porter? Haven't you always wanted to do something like what Porter's doing?  Aren't you itching to find out whether Porter outdoes all his fellow bad guys and gets away with his money?  I don't know about you, but for me the answer is no to all three questions. If Porter were at least intelligent about how he goes about his scheme, he might be worthwhile watching, but in fact his tactics are incredibly dumb and succeed only by fiat of screenwriter and director.  For one example, Porter stupidly gives away his greatest advantage, the fact that his adversaries don't know he's alive.  In another scene, Porter asks a Hulking Tough Dude to show him to his criminal boss.  The Hulking Tough Dude refuses, so Porter rips the HTD's earring out.  The HTD immediately whips out a gun and shoots Porter dead.  No, wait, that's what would really happen.  Because we are living in Hayes\/Abascal\/Helgeland Land, the HTD meekly leads Porter in to see the criminal boss.I have difficulty believing that anything of Brian Helgeland, the screenwriter of the excellent L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, survives in this film, since he was sacked before it was done.  It is much easier for me to blame Terry Hayes, co-writer and author of such stupidity as MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME, and Paul Abascal who was final director.  Whoever may be to blame obviously wanted to take his source material (a Donald Westlake story variously alleged to be either POINT BLANK or THE HUNTER) and turn it into just what we all needed, another take on PULP FICTION.  He got all the bad parts of Tarantino's hit right the mindless, senseless, bloody, and sadistic violence, the characters with no appeal or redeeming features whatsoever, and the darker-than-black humor that generally hurts too much to laugh at.  However, while the dialogue in both films is mostly meaningless, Tarantino's had a spontaneous, natural sound to it; it may have been empty, but it was at least realistic.  Here, the lines sound contrived as well as empty.  Gibson's voice-over narration is omnipresent and irritating, especially when used to reveal points about his character that are already intensely obvious, since there is only one point to his character that he is an unmitigated S.O.B.It takes a lot to earn this disgusting film its one lonely star.  The dark cinematography by Ericson Core conveys the amoral world of Porter convincingly.  Gibson is always watchable, though it's sad to see him play such a one-note role.  (There is a second note, Gibson's romance with Bello, but it's so tacked-on and reeking of cliche that it doesn't count).  Gregg Henry's Val Resnick, the anti-antihero, is appropriately slimy.  Kris Kristofferson plays a character named Bronson who, probably by design, resembles the Bronson we all know and who is vastly more sympathetic than Gibson.  James Coburn reprises his dapper villain role from MAVERICK, which is always fun.  But best of all is Lucy Alexis Liu as Pearl, the sadomasochist to whom all the violence is just a game.These few bright spots failed to distract me from the underlying fact that PAYBACK is a lousy film with a lousy script and at times is damn near unbearable to watch.  The one thing it taught me is a valuable but very disturbing lesson the viewing public has enough sadists who think that screaming, bloody agony is laugh-out-loud hilarious to make dreck like PAYBACK commercially successful.  It's scary.Rating * out of ****.

Three parts in this movie always give me goosebumps, but I wont tell them because I wouldn't want to spoil it for you who haven't seen it. If you break it down its all a great movie needs Action, drama, romance, a comic relief, (Steven). I also think that The Academy did a good job with it's awards, except I think Mel Gibson should have won best actor for it. But I must remember that it won Best Picture, Best Director, Cinematography, and Music. So I think they gave it it's due credit. Well, all and all, it's a wonderful movie, with the greatest ending I've ever seen. I seriously recommend it.

Its cinematic equivalent is Network, one of the highlights in the distinguished career of Sidney Lumet - but in this case, the target is more the relentless pursuit of ratings by the networks.While the focus is originally a news programme, it could have been almost anything. The original purpose of the show simply vanishes, an inconvenient detail discarded by the station, safe in the knowledge that the FCC is a toothless tiger. What brings about the change is the mental and nervous breakdown that befalls news anchorman Howard Beale - a role played to perfection by Peter Finch, for which he deservedly won a Best Actor Oscar.The sick man is shamelessly manipulated by Faye Dunaway and Robert Duvall, against the wishes of William Holden, seemingly Finch's only real friend. All these give virtuoso performances - Dunaway in particular stands out for portraying a woman apparently devoid of human feelings at the office, but capable of love outside it.For all the excellent acting - not forgetting Ned Beatty's towering monologue, for which he also received an Academy nomination - this film isn't perfect. My principal complaint is that it feels excessively long, and at times too sprawling and unfocussed for its own good. The ending also somehow doesn't ring true; while the TV execs have been portrayed as money-grubbing scum, capable of almost any excess (including giving air time to terrorists) in search of another point on the ratings, the notion that they are capable of ordering the cold-blooded murder of someone seems too far-fetched.Those points aside, this is an excellent film. Well worth watching.
