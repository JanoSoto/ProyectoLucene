I have long since been a fan of John Carpenter, in particular his works from the late 70's and 80's. In 'The Thing' John Carpenter has truly crafted a paranoia inducing, perhaps gut wrenching classic.The movie is an update of the classic 'The Thing From Outer Space', but only like it's predecessor, this film is in full color, and the characters of this film have much more to worry about than an alien veggieThe film centers around a group of Arctic Researchers you encounter an alien lifeform capable of taking the form of anything it comes into contact with, and out of for that matter. Kurt Russell stars as R.J. MacReady, an alcoholic Vietnam Vet, thrust into the role of leader of a group of relatively cold and callous men all of whom are readily plunging into manic paranoia and somewhat madness once they realize that they are up against a creature that can take any form, be any one of them.John Carpenter, more than in any other of his films, manages to create a truly believable and incredible atmosphere. When watching this film you truly get the sense of the dark,sinister, desolate surroundings, you feel and realize that these characters have no where to go...never for one second do you not believe they are stuck on a polar ice cap. Also, this film has perhaps one of the greatest endings to any film of it's genre, or any genre for that matter. I'm not going to give it away here, but to say that it will leave you wondering would be an understatement.Kurt Russell is superb as MacReady....truly conveying the emotions of a man thrust into a situation of unimaginable horror, forced to lead a group of men who cannot trust that the man next to them is not the creature that has driven them to the brink of paranoia and emotional meltdown.I don't care if this movie is 20 years old by now, the special effects in this movie are gut wrenching, mind blowing, and absolutely awesome. They blow away any CGI pixel based crap out there today. The 'Thing' itself is a truly horrifying and disturbing creation...unlike any alien you have ever seen in a movie before. Those who have a low tolerance for gore and blood had best prepare themselves for watching this movie.This movie does what any good horror\/sci fi movie should do, it really thrusts you into it's character's world. It leaves you wondering, what would you do, who could you trust if anyone you knew could be the creature waiting to feed on you, and take you over as well.  The images, and ideals of this movie stayed with me long after i first saw it, and today as i write this review send a chill up my spine.It is a true shame this movie is only now getting the proper recognition it deserves. A box office flop when released, now more then ever when movies are paper thin with plot, and one dimensional in effects, this film can be appreciated as a true masterpiece of sci\/fi and horror.If possible, get the Collector's Edition DVD, and enjoy it in anamorphic widescreen..the way it is truly meant to be seen. Marvel at the incredible scenery, the taught direction, the excellent atmosphere, the sweat inducing, gag reflex activating, and everything else that makes this movie great.Watch it with the lights out, with a group of close friends...maybe even with a dog around...if you don't what i'm talking about...you will afterwards.Don't let a classic pass you bye ","genre":null},{"date":"5 August 2002","score":"320 out of 374 people found the following review useful","review":"  Just to put things in perspective for you before I get into my thoughts on this film, I am only 20 years old and have grown up in the era of CGI, blue screen effects...and this movie was made around the same time i was born.With that said, WOW, I only recently saw John Carpenter's version of 'The Thing', and what a masterpiece it truly is.

To stop growing then and there and remain a three-year-old, a gnome, once and for all - Oskar MetzertathThe Tin Drum is based on Gunter Grass's highly acclaimed novel which used magic realism to capture the madness of war, and the folly of the people who made it possible. This movie only tackles the first two sections of the novel, leaving out the post-war events. The film won the Academy Award for Best Foreign film in 1980, and the Palm d'Or at Cannes. It was also banned in Oklahoma as child pornography. Despite moments of brilliance, The Tin Drum left me feeling incomplete and curiously unmoved.It is a very different kind of film from the others I saw this week, using satire and surrealism to explore people's reactions during the period from 1939 to 1945. It seems to be saying that it is all right to stop growing (that is, participating in the world) as a protest against the cynicism and corruption of the adult world. The setting for the majority of the film, Danzig (now Gdansk) is a major northern port town in Poland. Danzig was a free and independent city until September 1, 1939, when it became the first region taken by Germany at the outset of WWII. After the war, Danzig became a part of Poland again. The Tin Drum is the story of Oskar Matzerath, a boy who grows up in Eastern Germany before and during World War II. Oskar decides the only way to protest being part of the adult world is by banging on his drum and remaining a child forever. This is his rebuttal of society and his tin drum is his protest against the mentality of his family and neighborhood, or perhaps against all passive people in Nazi Germany at that time. Oskar tries to shock the world out of its inhumanity. His life reflects Germany's struggle to free itself from its own dream of Teutonic superiority and find peace in the national soul.David Bennent as Oskar gives an outstanding performance, creating a character that is both haunting and frightening. He looks like a little man in a child's body but his eyes are deep and have a very knowing look that seemed to be looking right through me. Oskar is not a cute little updated version of Peter Pan. Since age three (when he was given his first tin drum), Oskar can scream with such a high pitch that he can shatter any piece of glass. He even controls his scream to the point where he can break windows on the other side of the city, or etch writing into glass. Oskar uses his ability to manipulate and control the adult world, often using vicious and cynical snide comments about the insanity around him. At one point, he disrupts a Nazi rally by changing the beat of his tin drum to the Blue Danube which the band then follows. The ensuing scene where the crowd breaks into a dance and the rain comes down leaving the Nazi soldiers bewildered is one of the best in the film.I found the scenes where Oskar joins a midget troupe and finds loving companions of his own kind to be very tender and moving. However, the film became morally ambiguous for me when Oskar and his troupe decide to entertain the Nazi soldiers at the front lines. Schlondorff never really makes it clear what his motivations are and Oskar's actions seems to contradict his essentially anarchist protest for most of the film. The Tin Drum also contains some objectionable scenes of childhood sexuality and grotesque depictions of slithering eels being caught using a severed horse head as bait. The result, needless to say, is stomach churning.I found The Tin Drum to be absorbing and thought provoking yet, despite moments of brilliance, for me it did not add up to a totally satisfying experience.

BOYS DON'T CRY, however, sets itself on a higher plain than its little brother, and admirably achieves this point of comparison without resorting to cheap sensationalism.Because it's based on a true story, the movie immediately has to overcome a certain amount of scepticism, and, to be honest, it doesn't always succeed. Perhaps Hilary Swank is the weakest link here.   Her performance is sublime, she has all the right moves, but she just doesn't look like a man &#150; even a weedy, underdeveloped man; she looks like a sexually confused slip of a girl who wishes she was a man which is what, presumably, Tina Brandon was. So why don't any of the &#150; let's face it &#150; trashy characters comment on this?  And why would an ostensibly straight girl like Lana believe &#145;Brandon' was a boy, and fail to notice the fact that &#145;he' wasn't, even after having sexual contact? (Yeah, I know there are ways and means for those so inclined, but I don't believe an unwitting participant would be in the dark for too long if those methods were used on her - which suggests Lana knew all along, but it suited her for other people to thing Brandon was a man). Obviously, such doubts aren't the fault of the movie, but they do considerably undermine the core of its story.   I can only believe that the true Tina Brandon was a lot more butch than Hilary Swank; that would at least explain how Brandon manages to develop a sexual relationship with Lana.As a movie in its own right, BOYS DON'T CRY is superior fare, paying meticulous attention to detail and character to such an extent that the pace tends to meander without worrying too much about plot &#150; especially in the first half hour &#150; which may tax the patience of some viewers.   It contains many appealing touches on the way, though, such as Brandon chasing Lana with his\/her camera, and taking a snap of Lana as she unknowingly smokes a cigarette at a factory window.   Such moments, absent of dialogue, capture his\/her feelings for Lana more skilfully than any words could.The movie also raises an intriguing question because, even after learning that Brandon is actually a woman, Lana has sex with her, even though she is not a lesbian.   It's difficult to determine what you would do in her position.   Was there a, possibly latent, leaning toward homosexuality on Lana's part, or was her love for Teena\/Brandon so strong that it transcended gender?Performances throughout this movie are excellent throughout.   Swank excels in a challenging role, and Jeanette Arnette is memorable as Lana's troubled mother.   But the best performance, in my opinion, is given by Peter Sarsgaard as Lana's cousin; his borderline psychopath is believable throughout, even when he finally topples over the edge.The inevitable showdown, when Brandon's duplicity finally comes to light, is filmed with a raw brutality that is difficult to watch, and captures the tension and trauma without spilling over into melodrama.   But that's not the end of the story, and what follows is even more harrowing.   Having said that, the movie perhaps goes on a little too long after Brandon's true identity is revealed.

Therefore, when salvation was partly provided by a dying woman's words in reference to a baseball bat, I could only shake my head in disbelief.In the end, the great message in this movie appears to be that God works in mysterious ways.  So does Hollywood.  Good Night Shamalayan.Rating 2\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"5 August 2002","score":"","review":"  A very enjoyable film. Good casting, too. In many of the earlier scenes, the professor is caught in a profile shot and, with his scrubby beard and jutting jaw line, seriously looks like a Neanderthal! Excellent irony!This movie many have not done well at the box office because folks these days are not as well read. They seem to have been expecting some great NEW story, not realising that the film is based on a story that is just a tad over 100 years old (first written by H.G.Wells in 1895), though this time through it has an interesting twist on things. Instead of building a time machine to prove a mathematical point (that time is just like space) the effort is spurred on by a need to 'fix' the past.. to recover a lost love.Unfortunately even THIS effort isn't handled very well.

If he were really so obsessed as to spend over four years building this thing, why would he quit after ONE failure?Other than this new twist, the film differs from the book in that there is no return to the 'present' time. His philosophical bent on the search for science drives him to return, to present his arguments, to try to convince fellow scientists and contemporary thinkers, yet in the end realises that it is only HE that understands, and so, looking for further knowledge, heads out.. apparently to never return, though always in control.

Mel Gibson is refreshingly subdued, and when he vamooses on seeing an alien's tail (possibly), it is unlike anything you have seen from Mel.  The movie does not have surprises like in Shyamalan's previous movies, and is a welcome change.  Unbreakable's ending seemed contrived.Signs has wonderful camera work, and a great musical score.  The movie is eerie, funny, and moving.  Signs is about how normal people would behave when aliens came to earth.  Not how Will Smith would, based on Jeff Goldblum's advice.  The movie is disturbing.It is troublesome nevertheless.  Staying away from special effects altogether is not a sign of greatness in the young Indian director.  I mean, a movie must be different from a play in some way.  Signs isn't.  I'd still like to see how Shyamalan uses special effects, if he is to be compared to Spielberg.  I had the same problem with Unbreakable the train shook, but we did not see it crash.  How would Shyamalan make it look different on screen? That's my poser.My feeling is Shyamalan either doesn't have the ability to show these effects, or wants to save money.  The trouble is his films are becoming blockbusters in spite of a lack of effects.  Signs has more scope, and I felt it wanting.  It is very well for critics to say that it is what you don't see that's scary.  Spielberg did something similar in Jaws, but the final showdown with the shark looks frightening on the screen even today. The creature in Signs was more comical than anything else.PS.  I am an Indian, and a die-hard Shyamalan addict. I hope he will listen.
