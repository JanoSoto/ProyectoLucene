I have always admired Michael Keaton's work. He is one of those actors who can do both comedy and drama and do it very well. 1988 was an incredible year for Keaton, he was even featured on the cover of Newsweek. He was in two films that year where he played parts that were as different from each other as night and day and he was awesome in both. In Beetlejuice he played a comedy part. He was hilarious as a lecherous scuzzball from hell. He was just too funny to be scary. That was as original a comedy as you would ever see and it was due largely to Keaton's wonderful performance. In Clean And Sober he plays a dramatic role just as awesomely. This film is dark and gritty and at times depressing. You feel drawn into the darkened world of drug addiction where there is no hope and no light at the end of the tunnel. Watching Darryl Pointer's tortured life reminded me of a poem I heard that went    Now hollow fires burn out to black and the lights are dimming low    Square your shoulders lift your pack leave your friends and go    Fear not my friends, naughts to dread look not left or right    In all the endless hell you walk there is nothing but the night Darryl is a real anti-hero in so many ways. He is self centered, very abrasive and he just checks himself into the rehab center to get the heat off himself because after a night of boozing and coking there is a dead girl in his bed. At first glance, Darryl is a real sob (even Keaton said that he was at first tempted to turn this role down because this guy is such a pig). BUT, but you still care about this guy because Michael Keaton's amazing acting makes Darryl seem so real to you. You say to yourself God help him, let him see the light before its too late. Morgan Freeman was relatively unknown at the time, but he carries the load as Darryl's almost saintly counselor. There is one scene that takes place when they are both at a urinal (how touching!) where he tells Keaton to take it one step and one second at a time. SPOILER ALERT!SPOILER ALERT! Kathy Baker gives a fine performance as well as another addict that Darryl ends up really connecting to. You feel so sorry for this woman and sense the pain that she has inside as well. I think her biggest problem was just plain self hatred. How can other people love you if you don't love yourself? The most painful lesson that Darryl learns is that you can't control other people's lives and change their destinies. It's wonderful when you see this man who was so self centered start caring about other people and realize the truth about his own addictions.

His is a fairly unremarkable life that spans recent history.  It begins with his childhood in Alabama and his growth from humble beginnings to take part in many memorable events in recent American history.I saw this when it came out and have seen it several times since then.  I haven't reviewed it until now because I've always felt that my views of this film were pushed one way or another by a) it winning lots of Oscars and b) everyone hammering it in comparison to Pulp Fiction.  It should be judged on it's own merits, so I watched it yesterday in an attempt to do that.  I felt that I could view it in one of two ways &#150; either as a comical walk through recent history or as a message.As a special effects driven walk through recent history it is actually quite enjoyable.  It does get a bit tiresome to see Forrest meet one president after another, or invent popular songs\/slogans\/tee shirts\/ bumper stickers etc but it still works quite well.  The subplot of his love for Jenny doesn't work as well in this context and actually serves only to slow things down a little and to create the cheesy climax to the film.  However this subplot is the basis for the film's `message'.  Jenny and Forrest both start out in the same place.  Forrest works hard without questioning anything, sure he gets some tough breaks but his dogged efforts eventually work out for him.  Jenny, on the other hand, gets involved in the other culture of the times &#150; be it political rebellion, drugs, music, extramarital sex etc.  Her fate is less than Forrest's &#150; she dies and realises on her death dead that she should have just been clean cut like Forrest.  This side of the film smacks rather heavily &#150; first of all it is all too sentimental but, more importantly, it is a clear attack on the counter cultures and a condemnation of those that are part of them.Of course the film's humour means that the two extremes of Forrest and Jenny are also played for laughs so even a flag burning, drug user may be won over by the film before it starts to deliver it's message drop and drop.  I tried just to enjoy the comic side of the film but it wasn't enough to fill the 2 hour plus run time and I started looking at the sub plot &#150; and didn't like what I saw.The cast are all pretty OK.  I don't think for a moment that Hanks deserved his Oscar, but there's nothing more can be said of that.  He does do good work to play his `dumb' character so well but it shouldn't really have won no matter who else it was up against.  Penn is OK but only has to play `bad' for most of the film.  Sinise is pretty good value and his character is a mix, with the bitterness writ large on his life.  Williamson plays another `dumb' character but does OK and Field is alright as Forrest's Mom.  To be honest the cast all match the tone of the film &#150; all good people who just keep plodding along and get good results.Overall I should take the film to be praise of an America where even those with 75 IQ's can make it, however this simply isn't true.  What remains once this is rejected is the comedy of seeing Hanks inserted into archive footage (to mostly amusing effect) and a crass and obvious attack on those who would go against whatever America stands for.  It's worth a watch but the crude message and effect driven humour simply didn't help me understand where all those Oscars came from.

When she realises the reality of the situation she has run out of money and luck.  When she overhears three girls talking about how much money they made in one night, she learns of the bar Coyote Ugly, where the barmaids are so lively and fun that they draw the crowds.  She gets a job there &#150; but will it hinder her chances of getting her big break?I, like almost all men, enjoy the odd music video here and there &#150; it's not hard to watch MTV for longer than 20 minutes and realise that all the videos know that sexy girls shaking their asses will get the viewers watching their songs.  This is fine because a) the song may be good so that it's not all visuals and b) it only lasts 3 minutes.  The problem with Coyote Ugly is that it is basically a long music video and has the disadvantage that neither a) or b) are true in it's case.  The plot is very formulaic and everyone and his dog knows where it is going from the outset.  For large chunks of the film nothing of merit happens &#150; even a love interest is thrown in to try and fill the running time out.  This leaves plenty of scenes of girls in tight\/skimpy clothes dancing on a bar, covering themselves with water etc which is all well and good if that's all you want.

This film tries to be satiric, but takes itself too seriously in the drama department and fails miserably when it tries to be funny.

Now he must defend a judge he doesn't like from a rape charge he knows he's guilty of. Meanwhile all of his innocent clients (all of whom have weepy stories of poverty and hard luck) are getting screwed in his absence. One of them tells Pacino horror stories of prison, giving the worst delivery in the movie to the line they RAPED me! Too heighten the black comedy, our hero is close friends with a suicidal judge played by Jack Warden. The moral strain weighs on our hero and we get scenes of Pacino lightheartedly running with joggers to the worst music ever put in a film. The climax contains the famous You're out of order! speech, the crest of the actor's most over-the-top performance. Courtroom drama never looked worse.The satire of this film is weak and obvious, and it doesn't help that it's contained in a poorly acted, poorly directed movie. The score by David Grusin is torturous. If you want a good film that exposes the justice system, see THE TRIAL (1962) or BIRDMAN OF ALCATRAZ (1962). If want a good Pacino movie, anything from SERPICO (1973) to SCARFACE (1983) should satisfy. If you want a good Jewison movie, see ROLLERBALL (1975) or FIDDLER ON THE ROOF (1971).

Aronofsky's second major film is, perhaps, one of the most gruesome stories about solitude and addiction, a shattering first-time experience which may well leave you stranded.Watching it several times has somewhat shifted my original point of view, mainly because there are only so many times you can feel surprised by the brute force of the film. There is no need to put this in unclear terms, Requiem for a Dream is mainly a visual and sensory experience. It's extremely immersive and while some of Aronofsky's techniques may feel gimmicky after a while, the amazing soundtrack by Clint Mansell will keep you at dazzling heights all along. To be frank, I never understood how the exhilarating score just got overlooked by big award ceremonies; its value cannot be disputed now, as many bits of it have been overused of late by so many clips trying to come off as dramatic and intense - which they generally do, because the music is vibrant.For a while, I believed Requiem to be one of the best films ever made. I have since refined this opinion a bit, because such things are bound to happen after a number of viewings if the film is as blunt as this. Yet this is not to be taken in as a negative aspect, but more of a necessary evil. Requiem delivers its messages on several levels, the most obvious one being related to addiction issues. It's worth emphasizing that it doesn't boil down to a matter of drugs, because of the oh-so-many faces of addiction, physical and emotional, to narcotics and emotions. I do feel more affected though by the mesmerizingly sad story of solitude, with Ellen Burstyn leading the way most elegantly. To my mind, Requiem manages to convey this loneliness better than any other work of film I've seen, and its impressions are lasting.For anyone watching the movie for the first time, just be prepared for a rough ride which may well prove to be extremely rewarding. But I wouldn't necessarily go in a second time for the sheer pleasure of it; Requiem just isn't that kind of film, which however does not diminish its merits as it remains one of the best movies of the year - and not only.
