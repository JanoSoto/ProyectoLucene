","genre":"Horror, Mystery, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"28 December 1998","score":"","review":"  There is something so significantly different about Spielberg and Malick's takes on the war. And it is in that very distinction that one begins to realize how truly minuscule Ryan is in comparison to the far superior Line.Firstly, it should be noted that what Spielberg achieved in the first and final battle scenes of Ryan were nothing less than miraculous. The bravura juggling act of dramatic irony and bloodshed was mesmerizing to behold. There is no battle sequence in Line that is as remotely grotesque or technically challenging as those in Line. But of course, this is not a contest--and Line's concern for the war and it's significance is a little bit more profound than that of Ryan.Ryan, with it's battle scenes goes for the jugular, where Line completely goes for the heart and the mind of the audience, in a nearly three hour meditation on war, violence, love, nature and something Ryan could never do--humanity.In Spielberg's fantasy world--or maybe it was his screenwriter's--people exist as mere archetypes. To him, a war can not exist without every main character fitting into a cliched mold. You got to have the religious guy, the idiot, the coward, the ultra-brave guy, the ethnic guy, and so on. This type of character placement is so ridiculously obvious and is the main flaw of Ryan--which is further weekend by its trite monologues and awkward moments of humor. The scene where Hank's character tells the wrong Ryan that his brother's were killed was ludicrous--apparently inspired by any of the worst mistaken identity episodes of such shows as Three's Company. (Hey, the audience I saw it with was roaring with laughter.) In Spielberg's world, cemetery scenes merely exist as places for old men to crumble to the ground and scream at graves while family members stand 5 to 6 feet behind them.A Thin Red Line is about the connection that we have with nature. When the first death's occur in this movie, we get a cut-away to a field of grass, the wind gently caressing it, and the sun shining above it. A man later says that we are nothing but earth.And that is where the meaning of the film begins to emerge. This is a film that will confuse many, but like some of the greatest poems ever written, this will surely be a film that will need to be seen again and again-interpreted differently by all who read it.In Line you will see a bird dying next to a human being and the audience realizes that all life is fleeting and we all go back to the same place--the earth.It is a film that cherishes the meaning and unity of life. The relationship that Ben Chaplin has with his wife is of integral importance because it shows the love that two people have for each other is a unifying force, like water flowing through a stream. It is a unifying force similar to the one that these men have as they lay against grass and observe the snakes and the birds that are around them. (A later twist between Chaplin and his wife is revealed--adding an interesting take on this philosophy).Before these men die we get cut-aways to light seeping through the leaves and we see that these men are looking at that light, cherishing the beauty of nature--the last sight before they go out of this world and into the next.Spielberg's excessive flag waving and ulta-patriotic messages have nothing on Malick's brilliant metaphysical vision.When the American soldier's attack a Japanese camp, you will witness one of the great scenes in movie history. The tears that the Japanese cry, the way they hold their dying friends, and the way that they pray towards the heaven, looking at the vultures that will eventually eat their carcasses is deeply symbolic.Malick is telling us that no matter who the enemy is, we are all part of the same scheme--we are all going to the same place. It is a beautiful Emersonian philosophy--far more sophisticated, complex and relevant than anything Spielberg did in Ryan's technical shadow. In Ryan you cheered when the German was killed by the soldiers--in Line, you sympathize when everyone is killed, for you relate to everyone. And that is a far more interesting and complex achievement.Despite the gawky cameos of Travolta and Clooney (surely due to cutting-floor blues) the refreshing thing about this movie is that the big stars in the movie never upstage the smaller stars. Characters are not introduced in this film the way they are in Ryan. Here, we see Woody Harrelson in a quick pan--as opposed to Hank's head-on, tilt-up, look-at-camera introduction. Malick knows how to control his big name stars and makes this film a full-fledged ensemble piece--almost as if this were a war film directed by Altman. All the performances are perfectly restrained and nowhere near as dramatic as Tom Hanks' excessive hand-shaking in Ryan.Line has no concrete narrative. It's a meditation on humanity as much as 2001 was a meditation on existence and evolution. The shot compositions, the cinematography, and the score were phenomenal. Where the once great John Williams was more concerned with milking the patriotic cow with his over-the-top score for Ryan--Hans Zimmer, in Line, creates a score that is alternately inspirational and frightening. Drum beats and aural, jungle sounds captivate you in every frame--from the slow crawl of ships to islands, to the endless climbs up the mountains.The first hour of the film is like a horror film as you await for the faceless enemies to appear--enemies whose faces are very much like those of the heroes. The ships of fearful men all going to the same place, all wondering if they will come out. By the end, they have learned more about life than they care to ever experience again. Some will come back while others will return to the earth a little sooner than the rest. The last 10 minutes are a grim reminder of how all of us, one day, will stare death in the face, and we will realize that we are all islands. John Dunne would be proud.

To him, a war can not exist without every main character fitting into a cliched mold. You got to have the religious guy, the idiot, the coward, the ultra-brave guy, the ethnic guy, and so on. This type of character placement is so ridiculously obvious and is the main flaw of Ryan--which is further weekend by its trite monologues and awkward moments of humor. The scene where Hank's character tells the wrong Ryan that his brother's were killed was ludicrous--apparently inspired by any of the worst mistaken identity episodes of such shows as Three's Company. (Hey, the audience I saw it with was roaring with laughter.) In Spielberg's world, cemetery scenes merely exist as places for old men to crumble to the ground and scream at graves while family members stand 5 to 6 feet behind them.A Thin Red Line is about the connection that we have with nature. When the first death's occur in this movie, we get a cut-away to a field of grass, the wind gently caressing it, and the sun shining above it. A man later says that we are nothing but earth.And that is where the meaning of the film begins to emerge. This is a film that will confuse many, but like some of the greatest poems ever written, this will surely be a film that will need to be seen again and again-interpreted differently by all who read it.In Line you will see a bird dying next to a human being and the audience realizes that all life is fleeting and we all go back to the same place--the earth.It is a film that cherishes the meaning and unity of life. The relationship that Ben Chaplin has with his wife is of integral importance because it shows the love that two people have for each other is a unifying force, like water flowing through a stream. It is a unifying force similar to the one that these men have as they lay against grass and observe the snakes and the birds that are around them. (A later twist between Chaplin and his wife is revealed--adding an interesting take on this philosophy).Before these men die we get cut-aways to light seeping through the leaves and we see that these men are looking at that light, cherishing the beauty of nature--the last sight before they go out of this world and into the next.Spielberg's excessive flag waving and ulta-patriotic messages have nothing on Malick's brilliant metaphysical vision.When the American soldier's attack a Japanese camp, you will witness one of the great scenes in movie history. The tears that the Japanese cry, the way they hold their dying friends, and the way that they pray towards the heaven, looking at the vultures that will eventually eat their carcasses is deeply symbolic.Malick is telling us that no matter who the enemy is, we are all part of the same scheme--we are all going to the same place. It is a beautiful Emersonian philosophy--far more sophisticated, complex and relevant than anything Spielberg did in Ryan's technical shadow. In Ryan you cheered when the German was killed by the soldiers--in Line, you sympathize when everyone is killed, for you relate to everyone. And that is a far more interesting and complex achievement.Despite the gawky cameos of Travolta and Clooney (surely due to cutting-floor blues) the refreshing thing about this movie is that the big stars in the movie never upstage the smaller stars. Characters are not introduced in this film the way they are in Ryan. Here, we see Woody Harrelson in a quick pan--as opposed to Hank's head-on, tilt-up, look-at-camera introduction. Malick knows how to control his big name stars and makes this film a full-fledged ensemble piece--almost as if this were a war film directed by Altman. All the performances are perfectly restrained and nowhere near as dramatic as Tom Hanks' excessive hand-shaking in Ryan.Line has no concrete narrative. It's a meditation on humanity as much as 2001 was a meditation on existence and evolution. The shot compositions, the cinematography, and the score were phenomenal. Where the once great John Williams was more concerned with milking the patriotic cow with his over-the-top score for Ryan--Hans Zimmer, in Line, creates a score that is alternately inspirational and frightening. Drum beats and aural, jungle sounds captivate you in every frame--from the slow crawl of ships to islands, to the endless climbs up the mountains.The first hour of the film is like a horror film as you await for the faceless enemies to appear--enemies whose faces are very much like those of the heroes. The ships of fearful men all going to the same place, all wondering if they will come out. By the end, they have learned more about life than they care to ever experience again. Some will come back while others will return to the earth a little sooner than the rest.

The fragmented views of scenes, jumping from one angle to another, the tendency of anything looked at for long enough suddenly filling the whole field of vision, and the overwhelmingness of water and the ocean; all those things made me (as someone with Irlen syndrome, a visual-perceptual disorder with very similar visual effects) feel right at home.

Before commenting on the film as a whole, I want to make that clear, because in the inevitable rush to pick this film apart (the plot, the voices, the religious significance, the literary accuracy, the moral issues, the music, the comparisons with Disney and de Mille, etc...) one might easily become distracted from the aesthetic and technical triumphs of The Prince of Egypt, and that would be unfortunate.  As someone who has an interest and appreciation of animation, I can say that this is the first film I've seen that successfully integrates computer-generated animation and traditional animation (and I've seen many attempts).  More importantly, as someone who has eyes, I can say that the result is a visual experience of intense style and beauty.  In fact, the initial depiction of Egypt is so breathtaking, that it seriously hinders the film's later efforts to vilify it.Comparisons with Disney are inevitable, especially because Prince of Egypt employs tired Disney formula in an attempt, I assume, to remain economically viable.  What a shame, since Disney hasn't made a decent film since Aladdin. I am referring, of course, to the unnecessary musical numbers and the two high priests, the film's comic relief, who are drawn grossly out of proportion to the other characters.  Even worse than their unoriginality, however, is the open mockery of ancient Egyption religion and culture, which these two characters embody.  I found their musical number especially appalling.  On the other hand, it's a story in which the protagonists succeed only through a greater capacity for cruelty and destruction and the slaughter of innocent children, so it's kind of hard to nail down any concrete moral standard here.In general, I thought the story was well told, with solid direction and a good script.  The only complaint I have about the voice acting is that Jeff Goldblum's unmistakable mannerisms seriously distract from his character.  I suspect that I wasn't really bothered by the others only because I hadn't seen a cast list before seeing the film.  I wish they would stop relying on celebrity voices for animated features.

Although they both deal with World War II, any critic who pens this movie as a copy-cat of Saving Private Ryan is sadly mistaken.  The differences between these two movies are plain as day.   Both contain fighting scenes, but The Thin Red Line is so much more philosophical and introspective, I can see no way to compare the two.The Thin Red Line, weighing in at 2 hours 45 minutes is well worth every one.  This movie is much better than Saving Private Ryan because this movie is able to express a man's emotions and feelings and conscience.  The Thin Red Line deals with the invasion of Guadal Canal, a turning point in World War II.  This movie does contain a few war scenes with men being shot and blown up, but it goes beyond that into the psyche of the soldier, the personal misgivings and diffidence included in war.  It follows the lives of many men, not just a select few, and delves into the inner thoughts of each and the reflections as they look back on what they have done.   The message in this movie is portrayed in a strong way, through the use of voice-overs, and is actually very cogitative as the audience can only remember or imagine as having happened during this awful period in the history of mankind.I just don't know how to put it, but The Thin Red Line leaves you with something to think about and talk about after exiting the theater.  It gives you a new outlook on life and death, and, similarly to Saving Private Ryan, portrays war as it was in all of its shame.

On the way, they moan, and complain which happens to be quite hilarious. Never underestimate the power of politics. Sure it may be boring, but it can also be funny. This is one movie to rent for a weekend. If you do, be prepared for a hilarious weekend.

Ms. MacPherson has a smaller role in the movie than does the main character portrayed by Tara Fitzgerald who does a magnificent job.  I enjoyed this movie because it wasn't blunt in its eroticism, it leads the viewer along until the viewer becomes a part of the scene.  Ms. MacPherson's acting is fair but is not spellbinding.  I didn't find anything terribly interesting about the cinematography but the screenplay was good enough to make up for that lack.
