When his parents demand he leave, he begins to spread rumors that his father is sexually abusing Freddy.When it came out in 2001, Freddy Got Fingered was universally panned by the critics, with many saying that it's one of the worst movies ever made. Over the years, it has somehow begun to receive more positive praise. I don't see how it managed to get that, as I just watched this movie, and it was absolutely horrendous. Freddy Got Fingered is a disgusting movie without a single ounce of hilarity and without a single good gag. Most the gags rely on gross-out humor and the like (which I usually have nothing against), but in this movie, there was just way too much of it. Among them include a guy breaking his leg on a skateboard ramp (and it's very graphic by the way), Tom Green swinging a baby around in a hospital, not to mention Tom Green spraying his father with elephant semen. However, a lot of this is relatively minor compared to some of the worse things in the movie, although I won't name any of them. Why? Because it really is that disgusting and vile. Seriously Mr. Green, what it heaven's name were you thinking when you made this picture? Tom Green plays Gord Brody, a man who moves back in with his parents to become a cartoonist. Rip Torn (who I can't even begin to think of why he agreed to this movie) plays Gord's father, who constantly insults and belittles him. By the way, on a side note, I was actually on Jim's side a couple of times, Gord's drawings were awful. One another side note, there is a scene involving the following, see if you can make any sense out of it Gord plays an organ poorly while eating sausage and saying Daddy would you like some sausage? That scene was pointless. I guess that they decided to throw it in after a lot of gruesome scenes to give us a break, but it didn't help much, as we were already so grossed out by what we had seen, that this wouldn't do any better. Another message to Tom Green Just because you can direct a movie, write the screenplay for a movie, and star in a movie doesn't necessarily mean that you should.All in all, don't believe the positive things that you may have heard, this movie is still an absolutely disgusting and unfunny movie that is totally and completely devoid of laughs. What possessed Tom Green to think that this was a plausible idea for a movie? I have absolutely no clue, but I will say this, it flat out sucks. I believe that it is safe to say that we all got the middle finger from this movie, meaning that we had to endure a lot of gross out humor that wasn't funny. Although I could have just turned it off, I wanted to see where it would go, hoping that it would get better, but unfortunately, it didn't. In short, Freddy Got Fingered is definitely not a movie to watch if you want to watch something funny. You are better off watching some classic comedy, like Abbott and Costello or The Three Stooges.

My own reaction to this movie, which I saw when I was ten years old, leaves me with no doubt. I was born in 1946, and in the 1950s I heard people talk about communists, and I saw shows on television dramatizing the dangers of communism. Essentially, communists were depicted as being cold and unfeeling, driven only by their ideology toward the goal of a complete takeover of the entire world. This attitude is somewhat parodied in The Manchurian Candidate (1962), when the communist Dr. Yen Lo refers to guilt and fear as being peculiar American inventions, when we all know they are natural human feelings. Of course, that movie came much later. In any event, I was too young at the age of ten to say to myself, These pod people are just like communists, because they have no emotions, and they want to take over the world. But I know I sensed the similarity between the pod people and what I had been told about communists.Unfortunately, as good as this movie is, it has a big plot hole. At first, a pod takes on the form of any person it is near when that person goes to sleep, duplicating everything but his emotions. We never find out what happens to the person when the duplication process is over. Presumably it destroyed and disposed of. But by the end of the movie, the presence of pod no longer seems necessary, and the person himself is altered merely by sleeping. Neither Miles nor Becky have slept near a pod, so no duplicate has been formed. And when Becky does finally fall asleep, there is no pod nearby. Moreover, she only falls asleep for a few minutes, and the duplication process takes much longer than that. And yet, she is completely transformed.Still, this is the best version, and that is mostly because of the stark contrast between the way people are before and after they have slept near a pod. The town of Santa Mira is full of friendly people. We see how warm and loving they are, and so when they are taken over by a pod and become cold and indifferent, we experience a feeling of loss. In the 1978 remake, most of the characters are unlikable to begin with, so every time one of them gets taken over by a pod, there is a definite improvement in his personality. Halfway through the movie, I was pulling for the pods. In Body Snatchers (1993), this remake is set on an army base. So, people walk around mindlessly obeying orders without any emotion, and then when they get taken over by a pod, they walk around mindlessly obeying orders without any emotion.The novel had an interesting ending. I haven't read it in a long time, but the way I remember it, Becky and Miles are running away from a mob of pod people, just like in the movie. But when they come to the field where all the pods are growing, Miles uses gasoline to start a fire, which completely destroys the entire crop. When the mob of pod people see what happened, they realize their plans of replacing more humans with duplicates are ruined. Because they have no emotions, they are not angry and do not avenge themselves on Becky and Miles. Instead, they just turn around and walk back home. At the end of the book, Miles says that the population of Santa Mira is slowly declining, and if you ever happen to pass through that town, you will find that the people who live there are quite unfriendly.

It was the music for an ad, that would be unauthorized now, the one with the legendary cowboy riding toward the sunset with Monument Valley as the John Ford-like background. And only later, I knew the theme was of The Magnificent Seven &#x85; one of the most emblematic westerns of Hollywood's Silver Age.I know the word iconic is hackneyed but there's no way it doesn't apply to Elmer Bernstein's score, voted #8 in the American Film Institute Top 25 scores, one that elevated the overall experience a few notches higher. Indeed, the movie is more restrained than what the score suggests, but it's this complementarity in pace and emotion that transcends the conventionality of the film, the last film leaving me with the same impression was Love Story. What the mind doesn't get, the heart does, beating with the same musical rhythm.And this is why The Magnificent Seven, although not the greatest Western ever, nor the most influential, is still a classic. But it takes more than musicality to make you forget the improbabilities of having a German kid playing a Mexican, a Mongol playing a badass gunslinger, a newcomer trying to steal his thunder with the most childish acting moves. It takes two things to be precise a story -a script- and a casting. Eventually you close your eyes on some aspects when it's Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen leading the show.But let's start with the story and gives the original writer the credit he fully deserves, and it says a lot about Master Kurosawa's Seven Samurai when its own remake is a classic. The original was first modern movie, a multi-layered story whose epic feel was only the backdrop of a collective characters' study and an insightful commentary on the way classes and backgrounds condition people's behaviors and attitudes. More than that, served by an irresistible casting, with an unforgettable Takashi Shimura and Toshiro Mifune, was the first film to combine the thrills (men hired for a mission) with a humanistic and universal message.Seven Samurai was a story of people working and fighting together, uniting their forces, and teaching that everyone is worthy of respect. And consequently, it was obvious that the film would make a perfect Western, since Kurosaws was influenced by John Ford's style, the loop was looped and explains why the film could be judged more positively than a rip-off of a Japanese movie. Only the location changed, the oppressed people are Mexican peasants and the villain is given a more colorful presence through Eli Wallach who plays Calvera. The remake shows signs of cinematic maturity by keeping attentive not to offend Mexican audience, after the dreadful Vera Cruz. The script was written in order to portray Mexican in a positive light. Samurai belonged to a higher cast and could patronize peasants, but Americans couldn't. The Mexicans' initial intents became buying guns, but they finally hired men because they were cheaper. The men were paid for that, and this is why, less romantic of course, the French title is still explicit The Seven Mercenaries And speaking of the mercenaries' casting, the film is a showcase of all the alpha male actors whose careers were about to start with the decade.Brynner, the lead, was the most experienced, while McQueen was the more-or-less sidekick, Bronson was the woodcutter and goodhearted O'Reilly, Vaughn as the man with a past, Coburn as the fast, lean and lanky knife thrower, and Brad Dexter is Curly, who'd believe that there would be more at stakes than protecting a village, and Bucholz as Montgomery Clift lookalike, the rookie. The correspondences with their Japanese alter-egos are uneven, Brynner was perfect, so was Coburn who was glad to play his favorite counterpart, but Mifune was such a larger-than-life character and the young Keiko Tsushima such a crucial one, they didn't deserve to be combined in one character. Still, the testosterone-laden cast is part of Hollywood's legend, as well as what went behind the scenes. The rivalries between Brynner and McQuee, and the other actors, the clanning that went during the shooting, Brynner's marriage, Eli Wallach getting adopted by his gang, everything contributed to cement the film's legend. It was a man's film with men playing cowboys, but the script managed to go beyond its usual material and be more than a classic Western, quite an underrated script, minimalist but with no wasted line, like when Yul Brynner points his finger to the direction he takes, would talking change anything? No, but we wouldn't remember it. Some of the Seven have no more than 20 lines but we never feel one presence surpassing the other.Half the length of its glorious ancestor, the script told the story with a sense of self- awareness, conveying the same noble values and reflecting on the gunslinger's condition. This self-questioning aspect leaves a bitter taste to this victory, and while the film feels like the last hurrah of the classic Western movie, there are some clues of maturity, when the last line is we always lose, it makes you think about the future of these men no land, no wives, no families, and maybe these cowardly peasants are not the most to pity, as Bronson would say.To a certain extent, the film is, after Rio Bravo, one of the last classic Western and one that would pave the way to the new revisionist Westerns, but while I used to think it was Leone who started it, there is some credit to address to Sturges, after all, his film was also adapted from a Kurosawa movie, a magnificent one!

The correspondences with their Japanese alter-egos are uneven, Brynner was perfect, so was Coburn who was glad to play his favorite counterpart, but Mifune was such a larger-than-life character and the young Keiko Tsushima such a crucial one, they didn't deserve to be combined in one character. Still, the testosterone-laden cast is part of Hollywood's legend, as well as what went behind the scenes. The rivalries between Brynner and McQuee, and the other actors, the clanning that went during the shooting, Brynner's marriage, Eli Wallach getting adopted by his gang, everything contributed to cement the film's legend. It was a man's film with men playing cowboys, but the script managed to go beyond its usual material and be more than a classic Western, quite an underrated script, minimalist but with no wasted line, like when Yul Brynner points his finger to the direction he takes, would talking change anything? No, but we wouldn't remember it. Some of the Seven have no more than 20 lines but we never feel one presence surpassing the other.Half the length of its glorious ancestor, the script told the story with a sense of self- awareness, conveying the same noble values and reflecting on the gunslinger's condition. This self-questioning aspect leaves a bitter taste to this victory, and while the film feels like the last hurrah of the classic Western movie, there are some clues of maturity, when the last line is we always lose, it makes you think about the future of these men no land, no wives, no families, and maybe these cowardly peasants are not the most to pity, as Bronson would say.To a certain extent, the film is, after Rio Bravo, one of the last classic Western and one that would pave the way to the new revisionist Westerns, but while I used to think it was Leone who started it, there is some credit to address to Sturges, after all, his film was also adapted from a Kurosawa movie, a magnificent one! ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Western"},{"date":"30 December 2014","score":"","review":" A thrilling double-bill of this classic tall-tale of alien body-snatchers, based on Jack Finney's novel, for latter-day audience, perhaps we can still recall the latest remake THE INVASION (2007, 5\/10), as a star vehicle for Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig, which was dead on arrival as a major flop and presages their next colossal box-office fiasco THE GOLDEN COMPASS (2007, 4\/10). Fortunately these two earlier versions are considerably better than the ill-fated mega-star paycheck product, the original 1954 film is directed by Don Siegel (DIRTY HARRY 1971, 7\/10), within a condensed 80 minutes, it delineates the absurd story with a gripping pace and impressive monochromatic cinematography. Miles Bennell (McCarthy) is a small-town doctor, who has just reunited with his sweetheart Becky Driscoll (Wynter), they discover that many townsfolk are progressing into a widespread hysteria and claim their relatives have turned into emotionless where as their pretense remains the same. Soon with another couple Jack and Teddy (Donovan and Jones), they come to grasp that human beings are being duplicated during their sleep by unspecified alien species, things goes downhill quickly, they have to differentiate aliens among people they know, flee for help while try their best to resist the overwhelming sleepiness.Due to the curb of special effects development and budget, the supposedly bone-chilling scenes with human replicas are visibly mannequins covered with foam, and the extraterrestrial seedpods are equally below the groundbreaking line albeit the eery and intense atmosphere is rendered in full throttle. McCarthy exerts sizable effort to maintain the intriguing momentum meanwhile manages to squeeze time to ignite the moment of romance with Wynter, although appearing on screen for most of the screen-time, whose role is inclusively subsidiary, merely as a gorgeous love interest and a shorthand of a secretary. The rest of cast is serviceable but there is no room for any showboating in the taut storyline. Wisely, the film probes into the analysis of humanity-depravity process, even disregard the reference of the purported metaphor for the McCarthyism at then, the sudden action of draining away humanity into a void robot shed an urgent light to our mundane procedure of dehumanizing our personality in a far slower but equally toxic manner. The film starts with a flashback to the horrifying happenings, and the ending echoes Mile's narrative with a more encouraging upshot, which conveniently slackens off the impact of a no-way-out despair when Miles finally reaches the highway, no one stops to listen to him and overtly the seedpods have already been transported to elsewhere to indicate a thorough duplication of our entire race is ominously under way. Plus, one inexplicable mishap is that there is no explanation of what happens to the original body when his or her inexpressive clone comes into life (thankfully, in the 1978 version, it is explicitly demonstrated). The 1978 color version is directed by Philip Kaufman (QUILLS 2000, 6\/10), the story is transposed to a metropolitan San Francisco, Matthew Bennell (Sutherland) and Elizabeth Driscoll (Adams) are fellow health inspectors, while Elizabeth is living with her dentist boyfriend Geoffrey (Hindle), screenwriter W.D. Richter upgrades the romance to the mutual attraction between two colleges after Geoffrey firstly being replaced. One striking feature of this remake is to visualize the aliens in a more graphic picture, ever since the opening credits, beholders are fully witnessed how the unearthly life forms arrive and thrive on our planet. Using lurid palette and tilted camera angle to evince that the abnormality is threatening (with a cameo of Robert Duvall), these two stunts are further maneuvered to produce the omnipresent weirdness with the hypnotizing sound effect. From the floral embellishment, to the spooky mud bath, to the paranoiac street mania, Kaufman does modernize the original concept up to the hilt, it is also more scarier and disturbing by default. Sutherland crafts a slow-burning exigency of being a reluctant hero under a rampant panic, the utile assault he is wreaking on the primitive clones and a final howl guarantees his leading status in this overhaul of a telling fiction. 1978 is a breakthrough year for Brooke Adams, starring both Terrence Malick's DAYS OF HEAVEN (1978, 9\/10) and this Sci-Fi remake, her Elizabeth is more intuitive and has more initiative to get to the bottom of the mystery, the chemistry between her and Sutherland is also given a full-extent development. Leonard Nimoy, brings a solid supporting role as Dr. David Kibner, masks his ulterior motive instead of being conspicuously opinionated as Larry Gates in the original movie. A youthful Jeff Goldblum is offered very few to perform, whereas Veronica Cartwright, who would be best remembered as a regular in Sci-Fi or fantasy productions (ALIEN 1979, 9\/10; THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK 1987, 5\/10), assumes the most sleep-resistant character in the climactic finale. The ending is essentially different from the original and the novel itself (where the aliens voluntarily retreat), with its silent end-credits, it surprisingly evokes a sublimated sensation of shock value. Also worth mentioning, Kevin McCarthy and Don Siegel's cameos are signs in homage to the original. Generally speaking both films are of excellency to be viewed by newer generations and personally, I give an edge to Kaufman's more comprehensive achievement.

After all, it's not an easy task to turn a short novella into a full feature length film. And, given that this and all of H.G. Wells' stories are told by first-person narration, it would take some careful adaptation to preserve the tone of the book, much of which takes place in the narrator's own head as he attempts to rationalise the world he has been thrust into, as any pragmatic man of science would. If that sounds dull to you, worry not, because this is not a careful adaptation, it's Hollywood. To their credit, they didn't cast Brendan Fraser as the time traveller, but when you see the way they hacked up the script, they might as well have.Spoiler time, so only read on if you've seen it - or don't plan to, which is a fine idea, since this film is now 12 years old and the intervening years have spawned a number of other bombs on which you could waste an hour and a half of your life.I'll begin at the beginning, which is the first thing they ruined. The beginning of H.G. Wells' novel is full of charm and mystery that sets the scene. Time's been kind to this story, unlike some of Wells' work, and there was an opportunity to tell a really good tale here whilst still being trendy and engaging...perhaps even a little steam-punk. The dinner party, the educated sceptics, the presentation of the machine - have been omitted entirely. Replacing it is a done-to-death tale of lost love, which is presented as the reason for the time traveller's invention, because apparently science needs a feminine muse and invention for invention's sake is not enough.Speaking of love, if you were hoping to see how the nuanced, innocent, paternalistic and vaguely uncomfortable relationship between the time traveller and Weena was handled, this simply isn't there either. The Eloi aren't as you might remember them, and the female lead is far from naive and child-like - she's a teacher. You don't need to be a linguist to want to start pounding your head against the screen when she begins speaking perfect English after a mere 800,000 years.It doesn't get any better after that. Cue heavy use of CGI and scary creatures that might as well be LOTR orcs (yawn), another bad dude and a big and poorly explained explosion.

After all, it's not an easy task to turn a short novella into a full feature length film. And, given that this and all of H.G. Wells' stories are told by first-person narration, it would take some careful adaptation to preserve the tone of the book, much of which takes place in the narrator's own head as he attempts to rationalise the world he has been thrust into, as any pragmatic man of science would. If that sounds dull to you, worry not, because this is not a careful adaptation, it's Hollywood. To their credit, they didn't cast Brendan Fraser as the time traveller, but when you see the way they hacked up the script, they might as well have.Spoiler time, so only read on if you've seen it - or don't plan to, which is a fine idea, since this film is now 12 years old and the intervening years have spawned a number of other bombs on which you could waste an hour and a half of your life.I'll begin at the beginning, which is the first thing they ruined. The beginning of H.G. Wells' novel is full of charm and mystery that sets the scene. Time's been kind to this story, unlike some of Wells' work, and there was an opportunity to tell a really good tale here whilst still being trendy and engaging...perhaps even a little steam-punk. The dinner party, the educated sceptics, the presentation of the machine - have been omitted entirely. Replacing it is a done-to-death tale of lost love, which is presented as the reason for the time traveller's invention, because apparently science needs a feminine muse and invention for invention's sake is not enough.Speaking of love, if you were hoping to see how the nuanced, innocent, paternalistic and vaguely uncomfortable relationship between the time traveller and Weena was handled, this simply isn't there either. The Eloi aren't as you might remember them, and the female lead is far from naive and child-like - she's a teacher. You don't need to be a linguist to want to start pounding your head against the screen when she begins speaking perfect English after a mere 800,000 years.It doesn't get any better after that. Cue heavy use of CGI and scary creatures that might as well be LOTR orcs (yawn), another bad dude and a big and poorly explained explosion.

After Bedlo has been turned back to human form, they travel to the castle of Scarabus, as Bedlo has told Craven that he has seen a woman there who resembles Craven's late wife Lenore (Hazel Court). Accompanying them on this adventure are Bedlo's bumbling son Rexford (Jack Nicholson) and Craven's lovely daughter Estelle (Olive Sturgess).As envisioned by author \/ screenwriter Richard Matheson, and realized by producer \/ director Roger Corman, this entry in Corman's series of Edgar Allan Poe related films is a delight. It's a spirited blend of horror and comedy, taking a playful jab at the entire Gothic horror genre. The pacing is rather deliberate, but the script & performances generate some hearty laughs. Clearly the actors are having a good time. Price and Lorre didn't make much sense of the script, and opted to play the material as broadly as possible. They also did a fair amount of improvising, which contrasted with the more meticulous approach that Karloff took. All of the ladies (including Connie Wallace as a maid) are ravishing, and Nicholson is fun to watch. The animation effects add to the goofy charm of the film. The major highlight, naturally, is the climactic sorcerer's duel between Price and Karloff. Price was very afraid of the boa that had to be draped around his neck at one point.The music by Les Baxter perfectly matches the mood of each scene, and Corman's collaborators, production designer \/ art director Daniel Haller and cinematographer Floyd Crosby, bring their A game as usual.
