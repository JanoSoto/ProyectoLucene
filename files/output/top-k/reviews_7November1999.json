I think it was the hype that gave this movie the bad reviews by some IMDB users, as let's face it, it can totally ruin a movie for some people.In Good Will Hunting, you have to look past the hype and Oscars and see that it really is a gorgeous film written by two very talented young men, and acted out by proficient actors such as Robin Williams and Stellan Skarsgard. Personally, I thought the plot was an excellent idea - maybe someone else could have thought of it, but could they have provided the great script? And as for the profanity - yes, there was a lot, but I don't give a damn! This is real life! People swear! Deal with it!Anyway, what I really enjoyed about Good Will Hunting was the psychological aspect - very believable. Here you have this typical 21 - year - old, drinking with his friends, getting into fights, etc etc, but you look below the surface and there's a lot more to him. I think this really tells us a lot about the people around us and makes a point about looking below the surface. This aspect of the movie also revealed a lot of sociological issues - yes, it IS believable that there is a genius in a rough suburb of Boston, repressed by his upbringing. (Hey, my mum even says so, and she teaches sociology!)I enjoyed the acting a lot, especially by Robin Williams - I had been too used to seeing him in cutesy films, so this was definitely a refreshing change. I feel he plunged right into the part and relished it, although something told me his accent wasn't quite right! Will's relationships with the people around him are wonderful to watch, especially with Skylar (Minnie Driver) - there was real chemistry between them. I also liked to watch how Will behaved around his buddies; the four guys really seemed as if they had known each other all their lives.Overall, I thought this movie was believable and touching, without your typical ending. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck really have done themselves proud. My advice Forget the Oscar nominations, the rave reviews, the famous faces, and sit down to watch this movie with a completely impartial attitude. You will see that it really is beautiful.By the way, I very VERY rarely cry at movies. But if there's any scene that will have me in tears, it's the one where Will finally breaks down and starts to cry. That's saying something!

This is a movie about one of them.I didn't read the book-shame on me, but works of fiction by scientists usually make me blush in embarrassment for their authors. But Carl Sagan was no ordinary scientist, nor was he an ordinary writer. Still I suspect that what made this an excellent movie was the script by James V. Hart and Michael Goldenberg. It is extraordinarily well thought out and carefully crafted with deft turns of plot and a satisfying conclusion, with no need for spaghetti code patches near the end, the bane of most sci-fi and action\/adventure flicks. It is also emotionally moving.There is, however, just the slightest written by committee feel to the movie. Everything is a little too neat and too well explained. It's a paradox of any art form that sometimes you can polish too much, you can overwrite and lose some spontaneity in the production. And yes, Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey) is a little too good to be true, and Arroway (Jodie Foster) really needs a serious fault or at least some kind of vice to round her out. Being a political innocent isn't enough. And the media and governmental reaction is a little too pat and cynical.However all of that is insignificant compared with the most difficult thing about writing a futuristic or superior civilization story, namely coming up some unknown technology or information to make it seem real. The formula for cold fusion would work, or the cure to cancer. But how can you do THAT?You can't (otherwise what you come up with would probably be more important than your script.) It is fascinating to see how Sagan, Hart, Goldenberg and Director Robert Zemeckis cleverly sidestep this pitfall. Only those who have tried it can know what a fine job was done here. And incidentally Zemeckis can be given credit for making Contact intelligible without any dumbing down, no mean feat in itself. As far as star Jodie Foster goes, it's clear she inhaled and imbibed the persona of the modern woman of science in preparation for this role, so well does she play the part of astrophysicist Ellie Arroway. They have her come out looking androgynous, which is appropriate for two reasons, one, she lost her mother early and had to identify with her father more than most (an explanation, if one were needed, for how she became a scientist); and two, those little green beings aren't going to be men or women, having given up our sort of primitive sexuality long ago. She is never glamorized; even when she dresses up, she still looks like a normal woman in a gown. And she is appropriately unpolitical and naive and far too honest in front of the camera, something the real Jodie Foster is not.Best line It's so beautiful. They should have sent a poet.

This is what WE would transmit and do transmit because such signals cannot be mistaken for natural phenomena. It's obvious that what we have here is intelligent science fiction. The general public may be surprised to learn-I know I was-that a significant segment of the scientific community considers the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) a pie in the sky waste of money and human energy. The prejudice is so great that until recently no self- respecting astrophysicist would dare specialize in it for fear of having no career. Well, there are a few brave souls. This is a movie about one of them.I didn't read the book-shame on me, but works of fiction by scientists usually make me blush in embarrassment for their authors. But Carl Sagan was no ordinary scientist, nor was he an ordinary writer. Still I suspect that what made this an excellent movie was the script by James V. Hart and Michael Goldenberg. It is extraordinarily well thought out and carefully crafted with deft turns of plot and a satisfying conclusion, with no need for spaghetti code patches near the end, the bane of most sci-fi and action\/adventure flicks.

American Pie sounded like a neat idea, because I don't think that the 90's have been spoofed enough. In the 60s, social satires like THE PRODUCERS were around. Then, there was BLAZING SADDLES in '74.

Indeed, there is not much explanation of anything; part of its English charm are the long silences, the pauses in the rhythm of the action, as in Grant's manner of speech.  Perhaps with such an obvious plot, explanation or any attempt at elaboration would have been banal.  Perhaps that is why the real glory of the film (after, that is, Miss Roberts' radiant smile) is the eccentric collection of supporting roles, each perfectly played, although Rhys Evans's Spike deserves to be singled out as impeccably offbeat.  Miss Roberts, too, deserves appreciation for a precision in phrasing that turns the rather stock character she plays into something more interesting.  Grant, though, really does need to lift himself from that English middle class bemusement that seems his only manner, whether he is in contemporary London, in Jane Austen's West Country, or Norman Lindsay's early 20th century Australia.Certainly a well-made and enjoyable film, but the principal protagonists should go on and do more and better things, as I sense they can.

I know it had a lot of things in it that would probably make you feel stupid when watching it with your mom but I didn't feel that embarassed. I wanted to watch a movie about real life with my mom so we could have something more interesting to talk about and I thought this would do it. It did. This movie tells the very truth that, I think, most people block out of there minds. Life is full of problems and we all have them. Even if they are differant than other people's problems, they still affect us all in the same way. I would give the movie an A just for that message. Also, most people on this Earth are too preoccupied with their life because they think they have it so bad, that they never stop to look at what they've got. If they were to look and see the many beautiful things in life just once, they'd see that their life is great for that reason alone. Well about the movie, it's great. I think it's the best movie this year so far. The performances are undescribable. Everyone does outstanding jobs, but the best by far is, of course, Kevin Spacey as the ever so true Lester Burnham. He does so good at bring the character to life that it's the best performance I've seen in my whole life and the best in movie history. He is your average person who starts to get fed up with his whole life and lives like he should've lived his entire life doing anything he feels like doing. Even if that means masturbating right in front of his wife. His life being changed sets off the whole mess that messes his family up more than it already was, which was to say, a lot. He smokes weed, works out, listens to his music he used to when he was a wild teen, even falls in love with his sisters friend. More and more he changes, so does his family. Well, you can figure the rest out for yourself, can't you? Go see it. You'll look at life in a whole new way. You'll realize that your not the only one with problems. Even the people who live in a nice house with nice jobs have it bad. I just hope we can all learn that someday. We might not now, but trust me, you will.

So, obviously, I went into `Fight Club' wanting to love it.  And I did.  Well, the first half, anyway.  From there on, it went straight downhill into just another Hollywood-produced uncreative clone-movie.  I could go in and pin-point the exact frame where the film turns from an intriguing, smart drama into an unimaginitive hybrid of two of the worst movies that I've seen  `The Matrix' and `Dark City'.All three of these movies seem to have a common  `new-age' theme.  They all convey the message, `The individual can do anything, and as long as they don 't seek aid  from an outside source, their power is limitless.'  Maybe these Anti-Establishment \/ Anti-Religion ideals are just a faze in modern media, but it could also be the direction the industry will be heading in the future.As for `Fight Club' on its own, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton play their parts well, and the movie does have some redeeming elements, but overall I can't recommend it.  But, don't let that dissuade you from seeing the movie-- I'd never say, `Don't see this movie'.  You should always see the movie to have an opinion of your own.

This is just a huge asylum that seems too conveniently easy for the characters to navigate without getting lost.  Setting aside, the actors are too Scream\/I Know What You Did...-like for my tastes, and there is way too much comic relief at the wrong times.  The ending was utterly propostrous, and for those that trash The Haunting for being FX-oriented, this movie is just as FX oriented. The difference, however, is that The Haunting had realistic and unique FX, not just a gray blob of matter.  And that's all I have to say about that.
