[{"date":"20 October 2011","score":"","review":" Fred Astaire and Burns and Allen stars with Joan Fontaine, who's A Damsel in Distress, in the movie about love found between an American commoner and a Lord's daughter. It begins with Joan Fontaine sneaking out to meet someone in London, but she never gets there. Manservant Reginald Gardner follows her to keep her under surveillance for her mother, and in doing so gets into a scrape himself. (The help have a bet going just who's she going to marry.) Enter Fred Astaire, who's a famous personality, whose publicity man, George Burns, builds up Fred's image as a notorious lover with many notches in his belt. Gracie Allen plays George's secretary, but, with her disposition, it's clear she doesn't do much. But as usual she supplies much naiveté and spirit to the film. So all London is agog with Fred's activities. Suffice it to say, Fred and Joan meet and the rest takes care of itself. This film is another case of a good film being virtually forgotten and\/or overshadowed by Fred's movies with Ginger Rogers. The biggest complaints I think most people would have with it, is that, in the beginning, it feels like an old film,(it doesn't feel timeless like Top Hat,) and, that it may feel a bit too British for some Amercians. And, also, like another reviewer has said, Joan Fontaine appears to be walking through it. Maybe the film needed a more energetic actress. Other than that, it contains outstanding musical numbers including A Foggy Day (in Londontown) and Nice Work If You Can Get it courtesy of the Gershwins. Overall, this needs to be seen more often on TCM, so that people can appreciate this overlooked Astaire gem.
