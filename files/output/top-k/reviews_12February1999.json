[{"date":"12 February 1999","score":"","review":"  Every once in a while a movie captivates me, even though I have some fundamental issues with it. Elizabeth is one such movie. It tells the story of Elizabeth I's coming to power, and her ensuing attempts to secure and consolidate her position.One of the first things you notice about this film is that medieval England was a very dark place. As the characters wander from room to room, the few candles (candles were very expensive and Elizabeth was broke) seem to create more shadows than light. If you ever visit a medieval castle or palace, you'll appreciate electricity and central heating like never before. Some of the scenes are reminiscent of old vampire movies, full of arches of blackness, and deep wells of shadow. The interior dark makes the few outside scenes, full of sunlight and green meadows, stand out in extreme contrast.Fortunately the cast bring their light with them. The performances are all very solid, and Blanchett is especially good. Dressed in dazzling costumes, the actors come across as real people rather than mannequins. The film's conflicts between Catholic and Protestant, and between various political factions, feel very real, very intense. The film has rightly been noted for borrowing liberally from The Godfather. The intrigues of the Pope are cast as the cutthroat maneuverings of a Mafia Don, complete with spies, assassinations, and paid informers. In this case, imitation is the highest form of flattery.The film also achieves a gritty realism in depicting medieval England. Heretics (non-Catholics) are burned at the stake; the castles seem dark and cold; and one gets the sense, as my friend put it, that it was a smelly place. This is not the sugar coated England of The Seahawk, that Errol Flynn classic, but the grubby, dirty world of Braveheart or Monty Python and the Holy Grail.The film's organizing theme is the relationship between Elizabeth and Robert Dudley. Dudley is Elizabeth's lover, and their romance, prior to her coming to power, is full of charm, affection, and love. Their relationship serves as the primary bellweather of Elizabeth's changing nature, as she assumes the role of Queen.The growth of Elizabeth's sense of power and independence comes gradually, and believably. By using many subtle clues, such as her hairstyle, and manner of treating her advisors, we see this young woman become a powerful and dominating person in her own right. Her hair, for example, starts out as long, loose red hair. Later it is piled on top of her head in the manner of the court. As Elizabeth harden, it is cropped short and tightly curled. The Elizabeth of the closing scenes, white-faced, girdled, and grim is a shocking vision compared to the charming young princess of the film's opening.My primary dissatisfaction with the film is that we never get much sense of Elizabeth the politician. By all accounts she was a strong and shrewd monarch, but Blanchett's Elizabeth seems more lucky than good. The Machiavellan maneuvers that secure her throne seem entirely the work of her advisor Walsingham. The one decision Elizabeth seems to make is to approve the purge of many of her opponents. While it is true that her supporters were loyal to her family and religion, rather than her person, she seems more of a tool, a passive head of a powerful political machine.

Things like when I think of Batman, I think extreme sports, and wait till you see the costumes -- they're practically wearing nothing, and I want to return to the roots of the old Batman television series.  Was Schumacher seriously planning to take Tim Burton's brilliantly dark vision and reduce it to leather-clad S&M freaks spouting campy one-liners while snowboarding? Sadly, he was.Where to start?  There's so much to dislike.  George Clooney plays Batman as, well, George Clooney, the same character he's played in every appearance to date.  His Batman smirks when he should scowl, his Bruce is insufferably arrogant.  Chris O'Donnell (Robin) takes his cue from George and swaggers and preens, going from whiny brat (I want my OWN car!) to juvenile-in-heat in every scene.  Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze physically resembles and has all the acting talent of a 1983 Buick, and Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl plays up her valley-girl schtick to a ridiculous end -- ending up seeming even more clueless than she did in Clueless.  The only characters who retain any sort of dignity are Alfred, as always, and Uma Thurman's Mae West-ish Poison Ivy.The script, for I assume there was one at least at some point, is composed of the worst indulgences of Uber-Hack Akiva Goldsman .  Goldsman doesn't write dialog, he writes one-liners, as if his goal would be to have every line in the film appear on a bumper-sticker or a T-shirt.  For example, in the comic books and animated series, Mr. Freeze is a tragic character prone to long monologues about his internal suffering (Patrick Stewart was considered at one point for the role, and would have been perfect).  But Goldsman diminishes him to a role far more cartoony than the cartoon, spouting insufferable dialog like Everybahdy Freeze! and All right, be cool.  Schwarzenneger, apparently, doesn't get the joke, because every single line is delivered straight, ignoring any pretense of comic delivery, bringing to mind a high-school play more than a major motion picture.  The first two films, and the third to a limited degree, explored Batman's psyche and that of his villains, asked questions about why and how the characters are how they are.  This script has all the depth and emotional subtext of an acne medication commercial.Even the props in the movie are all wrong.  The Batmobile now has no canopy, leaving the driver's head exposed (given the speed of the thing is supposedly 100 mph, it's not terribly practical).  It also looks in most scenes as if it's going about 20 mph, tops; I kept expecting a bicyclist to pass it and spoil the illusion.  In the end of the film, Batman is dressed in a silver suit -- perfect camouflage for a nocturnal creature, eh?  And, perhaps most unforgivably, Batgirl has no hood -- just an aesthetically pleasing domino mask which leaves her hair loose, all the better for the enterprising villain to grab and rip out.All of which could have been at least mitigated by some decent directing -- but alas, that was not to be.  Schumacher includes several shots from Batman Forever in this film, perhaps to tie the two together, perhaps because he's out of ideas  Batman and Robin running towards the camera, the chest emblem, vinyl-clad buttocks, and codpiece of each character as they suit up, and the entire opening sequence are all cribbed from Batman Forever.  He also bravely defies gravity and logic, letting our heroes fall all the way from the upper atmosphere and freezing Robin in sub-zero temperatures -- all without suffering so much as a scratch.None of it makes any sense, none of it is particularly watchable -- it's not even good for camp value.  The only salvation of the franchise will be to put it back in the hands of a competent director and a scriptwriter who is capable of writing an actual script.

I've seen it five times in cinema (during the 2 or 3 weeks it was running). Every scene is very carefully, if not to say genially designed, the film is filled up with wonderful situation jokes (old woman sings rap, a boy-george-like man which weeps because the marriage of his friends is stopped in the last minute, and very very much like that). Drew Barrymore didn't acted like a toy (as she has looked like often before), but like an admirable beautiful young woman here.The shortest way to describe the movie would be 'Titanic without the disaster' (or with a happy end). The evil rich man which wants to own the girl, the unknown artist which falls in love to the girl, the girl not knowing for a while who of these two she should marry, and the 'historical' environment (even if the eighties are no so far away than the Titanic disaster) - all remembers of Titanic.

First I thought that the film treated the Japanese, the enemy, evenhandedly showing them no better or worse than the oft times confused American GI's.  In fact most of the post battle violence was American.  The movie is presented in narration by personal thoughts was an interesting aspect and featured unusual and compelling flashbacks.  The movie seemed to more about psychology, personality, and philosophy more than war, but the war with its inherent graphic violence is very much present.  What I thought was outstanding and very unusual about this war film was the cinematography ---not the battle scenes but nature.  It is every featured in this film.  Whether it is the beautiful tropical grasses the soldiers are crawling thru or the water scenes including the ocean, a waterfall, and a stream all shot in captivating ways or and animals from tropical birds to fruit bats to lizards making appearances unexpectedly, nature is everywhere evident.  I'm sure there is a symbolic element here and I have my opinions but I'll let you draw your own conclusions.  Lastly (and not in importance) there were many outstanding performances.

Caddyshack is the greatest comedy of all time.  Every minute of the film contains a gem.  Chevy Chase is perfect, the man I hope to be someday.  While most people remember Murray and Dangerfield, they are the least hilarious of the actors.If you happen to be one to knock this movie, you just don't get it, do you?  Well, why don't you just watch Titanic a couple more times anyhow.Subtlety is the reason this movie is not just a sophmoric piece of 80s recycling.

Caddyshack is the greatest comedy of all time.  Every minute of the film contains a gem.  Chevy Chase is perfect, the man I hope to be someday.

Having said that, this is still a mess.... every attempt at 'zany' humor seems contrived, and every time I saw former '007' Roger Moore on-screen, I almost cried.

The film had such an impact that I immediately persuaded my Mom to buy our own copy and have watched it every Halloween night without fail since and on numerous other occasions. I love the horror genre but even as a fan I have to admit many of its family members a laughable.The trick with Halloween is that it was almost believable, the key to being scared by something is its invincibility and the Michael Myers character had this factor in huge amounts. The character of Dr Loomis is another component of the movie which makes it so much more frightening. His view of Myers as pure evil gives you an idea of what to expect. That's what creating fear is all about, it's a shame there aren't 100 John Carpenters directing quality horror in the world.

The casting is spot on- from the looks to the Italian mob, to the gamblers, the main characters.
