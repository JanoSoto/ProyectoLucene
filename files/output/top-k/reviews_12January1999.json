That one, like Fallen, centers around that classic good vs. evil story and contains plenty of religious\/biblical innuendo.I know, I know, we've all seen enough of these before. Or have we? Personally I love these types of thrillers that become more than simply thrillers once they begin to be brain bogglers.As many IMDB users have concurred, the premise behind Fallen is captivating, without uncertainty demanding of the viewer's attention. Too bad one can't speak the same for the acting, which I believe, is the film's tragic flaw. With sub-par acting, Fallen becomes a good film instead of one of the great ones. Denzel Washington as a detective in pursuit of a fallen angel isn't as convincing as he could have been. Goodman only dazzles during the last minutes of the film and Sutherland is plain boring.The plot\/storyline, in other words, is the life-saving force of the film, its uumpth I would argue. Simply stated, the acting just doesn't deliver as hard as I wish it could have. Nonetheless, this is a cool movie The way Azazelle (the evil spirit Washington is in pursuit of) enters people is brilliantly captured in a riveting chase scene, Hoblit's ingenious use of a Stones song as the way Azazelle reveals his presence, and the resonating voice-over throughout the film (though it fails to deliver as powerful an effect as say, Goddfellas.) all point towards Hoblit's craft.Still, Fallen lacks that special something that inspires all the accolade for similar films such as Seven and to a certain extent a detective story like LA Confidential. At the film's conclusion, the voice-over, assumably sepaking about the evolution of the human race, mentions something about the turning point in life. With a minor upgrade on suspense and even a greater one on acting, Fallen could have been the turning point of Hoblit's directorial career. Still, that's not to say he's fallen.

Many of those who will watch the remake (aside from Vaughan fans) are generation of film-goers unfamiliar with the Anthony Perkins original, or even Hitchcock's other work.

Actually, that was the best movie I have seen. It was a wonderful story about a dead dynasty, about a girl which has to find her family and about a wonderful love story. That combination of animation, music, history and humor was great. The only problem for me with that movie is that I can't find nontranslated videokassete with it.
