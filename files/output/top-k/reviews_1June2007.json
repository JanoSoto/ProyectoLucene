They use that set well, giving us a breathtaking stalk scene with a few surprises. The film has a few things we didn't find in the previous entries. We get a kool car racing down a highway scene, a massive explosion and way more gun play. Directer Wes Craven has decided to use elements of Nightmare On Elm Street in this one such as Sidney's freaky dreams about the killer and her dead mother, This being the third in the series I will admit that it doesn't come close to having the edge, the wit or the suspense the first one had. We're use to the format this time around. The opening murder was a bit of a disappointment it wasn't as gory or effective as one and two and way to predictable and the twist ending was a bit of a let down as if to say it's all been done before. But the film does bring the series full circle and also what we thought we knew about the past something comes back and bites Sidney on the ass. This movie again brings back Sidney, Dewey and Gale one last time and even a cameo of dead Randy giving yet again more horror movie survival tips from beyond the grave, well videotape. Again we also have a host of new characters such as Detective Mark Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey) the policeman on the case of the recent murders going and is also a film buff, Jennifer Jolie (Parker Posey) the eccentric actress playing Gale Weathers in Stab 3, Producer Roman Bridger (Scott Foley) angry that his movie gets shut down because of recent murders, Tyson Fox (Dean Richmond) playing a Randy type character in Stab 3 but deterimed to make the character his own, Angelina Tyler (Emily Mortimer) the new Sidney Prescott in Stab 3, directer John Milton (Lance Henriksen), Tom Prinze (Matt Kessler) Dewey in Stab and last but not least Sarah Darling b-movie actress plays an early victim in Stab 3.The Acting Firstly I was surprised to see Carrie Fisher in this movie even though it's just a 2 minute cameo but she rocks, Jenny McCarthy was very sexy charming and I liked her in her short time, Neve Campbell (Sidney), Courtney Cox (Gale) and David Arquette (Dewey) reprise their respective parts and nothing new is brought to them, Parker Posey I loved her comic and manic performance she was the real star of the movie Patrick Dempsey was great very handsome in his role he deserves bigger movie roles and more success because he's a great actor.All in all, well the killings were a bit of a let down much less graphic than the other two but Wes Craven does it again doing a brilliant end to an awesome trilogy.

I think I've seen it 9 times and I never get tired of it. With The Terminator, James Cameron brought a new sci-fi element in the movie world. It was a masterpiece that had great success worldwide. A lot of people didn't think he was able to make a better movie than the masterpiece he had already made. But in 1991, he did just that. T2 is without a doubt one of the greatest action movies ever, and certainly the best of the 90s.After The Terminator everyone knew that there was going to be a sequel. But I don't think they expected Schwarzenegger to be in it again. I'm very glad he represented his role, because that's what makes the plot even more interesting. Once again a T-800 is sent back through time, but this time with a different mission than last time this time he has to protect John Connor, the future leader of the Human Resistance. I'm pretty sure that no one could have directed this film better than Cameron. He knew exactly what he wanted this movie to be and how to get the job done. In an interview, Schwarzenegger said that Cameron is such a good director because he has such a great vision of what he wants to see. Every scene, every character, every song, &#133; you name it it's all as good as it can be. Cameron added the perfect kind of music to the right scene. And every scene was filmed very carefully. It can't get better than this.I think everyone agrees that Schwarzenegger was perfect for the role of the T-800. In T1, he didn't have to talk a lot, and that situation is different in T2. We get a lot of information about what kind of machine he really is, and about the war against the machines. Schwarzenegger has to play a machine and can't show any emotions, so a lot of people think that it's no big deal to play that role. But it's a bigger task than everyone thinks. Cameron has said this himself when he gave an explanation in 'the making of'. In fact, his exact words were Arnold's one of the most professional people I have ever worked with. He's got incredible concentration. He takes everything like a pro. So no matter what some people might tell you; Arnold definitely knows what he's doing.Linda Hamilton reprises her role as Sarah Connor and proves to be a very talented actress. She has to play a different Sarah than the Sarah you saw in the first movie much more aggressive, more driven, and actually more dangerous. But all with good intentions, as she wants to protect her son and everyone else, actually.The choice of Robert Patrick for the role of the T-1000 was a good decision, because he's got a neutral look he could be a protector or a terminator, no one can tell just by looking at him. And I think Edward Furlong deserves a big bravo for his fantastic performance in his first movie ever. I can imagine it must have been hard to play the role of John Connor, especially with stars like James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger in the team. That might have given him some pressure, but he handled it well. He did great.If you haven't seen this movie, please don't hesitate and just see it. It will blow you away.Bravo James Cameron, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong, Robert Patrick and William Wisher, for making the best action movie ever Terminator 2 Judgment Day.

Selznick got some loan out money from Darryl Zanuck for Alfred Hitchcock's services for two films (the second was never made), I'm sure Zanuck must have just loved Hitchcock when he told him that he wanted to make a film with just one set. Talk about cost cutting, anyway after a few failed scripts, Zanuck got American premier novelist John Steinbeck to write an original screenplay and since it was timely patriotic, Hitchcock did it.So for Hitchcock asking for a one set film, the movie going public got Lifeboat. A disparate group of passengers and crew are torpedoed in the mid-Atlantic and wind up together in a lifeboat. After their ship went down however, another ship in the convoy rammed in the U-Boat that sank them. The last one picked up on board is a German.The crew members include John Hodiak, William Bendix, Hume Cronyn and Canada Lee. Passengers are Mary Anderson, Heather Angel and a dead baby she clings to, and millionaire Henry Hull. And of course playing a Dorothy Thompson like correspondent is the great Tallulah Bankhead.Lifeboat is a wonderful film not just for the fact that Alfred Hitchcock succeeded in making a one set film that you are never conscious of while watching. But it's the only opportunity to see Tallulah at the height of her fame. She made a bunch of Hollywood features at the beginning of the sound era, but they flopped for the most part. So she went back to Broadway which loved her best and her season box seat at the Polo Grounds where she was the New York Giants most devoted fan. Lifeboat should have rejuvenated a movie career, but she apparently didn't care. Lifeboat even on its own is her best work on film, let alone in comparison to other films.The villain of Lifeboat is our German, Walter Slezak. He's a devious and cunning individual, he seems stronger and more fit than the other Lifeboat survivors and because of that and in spite of the fact he's hated, he gradually assumes charge. There's a reason for his actions and his fitness and when it's discovered, grave consequences erupt.Canada Lee, distinguished black actor from the stage, gets a role here that's far from Willie Best or Step N' Fetchit. My favorite scene in Lifeboat is when Hodiak who represents the left on the boat is trying to rouse the rest to just toss Walter Slezak to the sharks when he first arrives, asks Lee for his opinion as he's a member of the party. Lee replies simply he didn't realize he had any vote or say in the matter, a very trenchant observation about how blacks were disenfranchised in a quarter of the USA, some twenty years before the Voting Rights Act.The Lifeboat survivors are a cross section of the American people and this World War II allegory in microcosm is to show just why these Nazis are as evil as they are and why we have to resist. Even today more than sixty years after it was first made, Lifeboat is still a great cinematic achievement from Alfred Hitchcock.And it was made so cheaply which Darryl Zanuck ecstatic.

The last one picked up on board is a German.The crew members include John Hodiak, William Bendix, Hume Cronyn and Canada Lee. Passengers are Mary Anderson, Heather Angel and a dead baby she clings to, and millionaire Henry Hull. And of course playing a Dorothy Thompson like correspondent is the great Tallulah Bankhead.Lifeboat is a wonderful film not just for the fact that Alfred Hitchcock succeeded in making a one set film that you are never conscious of while watching. But it's the only opportunity to see Tallulah at the height of her fame. She made a bunch of Hollywood features at the beginning of the sound era, but they flopped for the most part. So she went back to Broadway which loved her best and her season box seat at the Polo Grounds where she was the New York Giants most devoted fan. Lifeboat should have rejuvenated a movie career, but she apparently didn't care. Lifeboat even on its own is her best work on film, let alone in comparison to other films.The villain of Lifeboat is our German, Walter Slezak. He's a devious and cunning individual, he seems stronger and more fit than the other Lifeboat survivors and because of that and in spite of the fact he's hated, he gradually assumes charge. There's a reason for his actions and his fitness and when it's discovered, grave consequences erupt.Canada Lee, distinguished black actor from the stage, gets a role here that's far from Willie Best or Step N' Fetchit. My favorite scene in Lifeboat is when Hodiak who represents the left on the boat is trying to rouse the rest to just toss Walter Slezak to the sharks when he first arrives, asks Lee for his opinion as he's a member of the party. Lee replies simply he didn't realize he had any vote or say in the matter, a very trenchant observation about how blacks were disenfranchised in a quarter of the USA, some twenty years before the Voting Rights Act.The Lifeboat survivors are a cross section of the American people and this World War II allegory in microcosm is to show just why these Nazis are as evil as they are and why we have to resist. Even today more than sixty years after it was first made, Lifeboat is still a great cinematic achievement from Alfred Hitchcock.And it was made so cheaply which Darryl Zanuck ecstatic.

Selznick got some loan out money from Darryl Zanuck for Alfred Hitchcock's services for two films (the second was never made), I'm sure Zanuck must have just loved Hitchcock when he told him that he wanted to make a film with just one set. Talk about cost cutting, anyway after a few failed scripts, Zanuck got American premier novelist John Steinbeck to write an original screenplay and since it was timely patriotic, Hitchcock did it.So for Hitchcock asking for a one set film, the movie going public got Lifeboat.

As per films of this genre,while the hero(in this case,heroine)may've ended the killing spree in this story,the evil may not in fact be eradicated,only dormant for a future batch of unwitting victims.For the most part,this film works almost in spite of itself. The acting is wooden(the only viable actors in this show,Kevin BAcon and Betsy Palmer,are either made as an afterthought or as a scenery chewing expository character,in that order),the dialog is rendered nearly un-usable and some of the action sequences seem forced or awkward. Yet the element of suspense,terror,sheer dread(much of that from the sparse music score employed) and even vague titillation keeps this film just believable enough to make the events that transpire seem doable and chilling.

Garrison is an eerily normal town with young families and very low crime...due to the fact that it is inhabited almost completely by cops. Just a few minutes drive across the bridge from the Garrison, though, lies the monster of New York City where (as Harvey Keitel's character Ray Donlan describes) everything is upside down as the cop is the 'perp' and the 'perp' is the victim. As much as we wish that all of these cops are upright men and women, with only the most noble concerns at heart, we quickly find that such is not the case.With an overweight Stallone (who upped from a 32 to a 39 waist for the role) playing the extremely insecure Hefflin, this movie lost much respect from critics from day one as it relied heavily on cast and performance. The formula for its success, however, does not disappoint as DeNiro and Keitel are re-united for the first time since 'Mean Streets' and both actors give two of the best performances of their careers. The plot of the film (however easily attacked by over-eager critics) is still riveting enough to keep the audience glued the storyline and characters with the aid of a slight suspension of disbelief. Ray Liotta also delivers brilliantly in the depiction of the complex character of Gary 'Figgsy' Figgis who finds himself in a moral battle between his fellow officers and his friends.Movies of this caliber are rarely made anymore; a simple enough premise that requires closer investigation by the audience, complete with an exceptionally talented cast right down to the very minor supporting roles (i.e. Peter Berg, Michael Rapaport, Annabella Sciorra, Mailk Yoba, Janeane Garofalo, John Spencer, Paul Calderon, Robert Patrick, etc). 'Cop Land' is a story about the true blue of not only the grit and integrity of real police officers but real people. It's a great example of how moral lines can be blurred and how, especially within the world of crime and politics, the answer is not always so easy. Stallone's performance is by itself an achievement, and if you're a fan of the old boys of New York, you'll love seeing them duke it out on screen.

I actually remembered a lot more than I thought, which was a shame really as I seemed to remember all the crucial parts which were significant for the whole plot. Anyway, it is still a great movie and I can imagine it is one of those movies you can watch all over again, as it's just so easy to watch. The movie itself tells a stereotypical story of a middle aged man named Lester Burnham and how his life is pretty much as boring as it gets. His daughter and wife thinks he's a loser and he also pretty much agrees with that. He's depressed, but suddenly one day he feels this desire of love and another life when he sees his daughter Jane's friend Angela for the first time. He decides to turn his life around and finally start living it.To be honest, the beginning arrangements of the plot aren't so original. There has been so much movies with a middle aged man who's in a life crisis and decides to take over his life and so on and so on. Despite that, this movie actually does it in a pretty good way and the whole storyline is so brilliant when it builds up. It's hilarious and it's dramatic, both well done and in the same package. It's not just the story which makes it so good, it's the characters who are pretty much stereotypical yet performed by an amazing cast. I've been watching a lot of Kevin Spacey -movies recently and I must say that the role of Lester Burnham is one of the best fitting roles I've seen him doing. He's just so excellent in the role and he even got a well deserved Academy Award of it. There's just something about Kevin Spacey I like, I don't know if it's the whole personality and substance or is it that perfect, I wouldn't say monotonic, but a flat voice which just has this certain charisma and credibility. Spacey also narrates the movie as Lester and the voice and the way he speaks is just so superb when you're looking at the whole main theme of the movie. Kevin Spacey is without a doubt the best thing the movie has to offer.The man responsible for the music is Thomas Newman, who I haven't heard composing even anything near average, his music is always top notch no matter what the movie was. I'd say there are two different music themes in American Beauty, one taking place when the funny comedic scenes take part and the other one being beautiful and slow when the dramatic scenes take part. The music sort of transports the whole movie forward, being so necessary for the plot as well. I shouldn't just praise Spacey's performance yet he surely takes the cake by far. Like I mentioned before, the whole cast is amazing. Lester's wife Carolyn played by Annette Bening, who I really haven't enjoyed as much as in American Beauty. Being a total hypocrite dreaming of a better luxurious life it makes the role of Carolyn a spot on for Bening. Then there's Thora Birch as Lester's daughter Jane, who's an insecure teenager, Wes Bentley as Ricky Fits the real estate king and Mena Suvari as the school's dream girl and Jane's friend Angela who Lester fixes his eyes on. It was also a pleasant surprise to see Scott Bakula in a so surreal role as one of the gay neighbours after seeing him constantly on the cult classic Quantum Leap.Although the movie being very good I think it still is pretty overrated. There's actually nothing particularly unique in the movie, expect those amazing role performances. It really doesn't offer anything mind blowing as even when it has originality it still is more like a stereotypical image of life seen many times on the screen. I wouldn't say I'm bored of it, but more like just wanting someone to invent something really new and unique even when having stereotypical beginning arrangements on the plot. This movie is a pretty good achievement in that category but like said it still isn't as unique as you could imagine. This might be just because I had seen the movie before and I remembered all the twists of the plot unconsciously. It's a real pity as this might have been a total different review if I'd seen it for the first time. Somehow it still manages to be a great movie and despite me jumping all over the negative and positive sides of the movie it still is a definite recommendation and because of the flow it is really easy to watch.

If you're tied of those PG-13 horror movies, this won't disappoint. It's like The Ring (in as good PG-13 rated horror films).I love this movie because it's like Lost, in which subtle clues are given away little by little until it reaches the twist ending. Believe me, the pay off is great, if you think this movie's pacing is too slow. I'm sure it's slow, if someone figured the twist ending already. If not, don't try to think some up or you'll get mad at the graceful pace the film is moving.Nicole Kidman gives a really great performance in here, as well as many other characters. The cinematography, the score, and the production, they're all great! This film really doesn't follow many mainstream movie rules. This movie doesn't need blood, special effects, scary make-up, etc. to even scare you. This film is creepy and is one of the best horror films these days have to offer.

He was orphaned as a child, bullied by jocks, and can't confess his crush for his stunning neighborhood girl Mary Jane Watson. One day while on an excursion to a laboratory a runaway radioactive spider bites him... and his life changes in a way no one could have imagined.Peter acquires powers a spider has... but the fun isn't going to last. An eccentric millionaire Norman Osborn administers a performance enhancing drug on himself and his maniacal alter ego Green Goblin emerges. Now Peter Parker has to become Spider-Man and take Green Goblin to the task... or else Goblin will kill him. They come face to face and the war begins in which only one of them will survive at the end.I don't know why I didn't like this film as much as everybody did. I think it lacked something. No, I liked the character's origins. No, not the action, since they were great with breathtaking special effects. Maybe they could have done more with the action or more with the villain (although I didn't like the Green Goblin as a villain).Everything good in the film isn't great, comparing to great superhero films like its sequel, Spider-Man 2 and 3, Daredevil, or Hellboy. I liked the action sequences in the film, and I liked the humor from some scenes.Tobey Maguire playing Spider-Man was relatively good, as well as Willem Dafoe and Kirsten Dunst. The score was good, as well as the cinematography. Maybe I was expecting more than they showed in the movie. This film was good, but it wasn't anything great. It fell short with my expectations.

'Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare' anyone? That's not to say 'Halloween Resurrection' is perfect, but it's darn sure more interesting than some of the other horror films that have come in the last few years.Pros The film moves along nicely. The premise is good and has real potential. Each and every actor gives a good performance and really seem to be having a good time. The kills are creative, something lacking from the previous film. The replica of the Myers house is quite impressive. Danny Lux can't beat John Carpenter or Alan Howarth, but his score is better than average and his version of the main theme is eerie. Brad Loree does a great job as the masked madman and is probably the scariest Michael since 4. The writers injected some humor into the mix and some of it works. Finally, Rick Rosenthal does a pretty good job as director and makes the film look quite dark and spooky.Cons As I said above, this film ignores 4-6. Some fans might not care, but I know there are some, including myself, that aren't too thrilled about it. And seriously, does it really fix things anyway? Lacks both suspense and good characterization.

Sure I hate the fact that, like H20, it acts as if parts 4-6 never happened, but what can you do? Also, there really are far worse and more disappointing sequels out there. 'Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare' anyone? That's not to say 'Halloween Resurrection' is perfect, but it's darn sure more interesting than some of the other horror films that have come in the last few years.Pros The film moves along nicely. The premise is good and has real potential. Each and every actor gives a good performance and really seem to be having a good time. The kills are creative, something lacking from the previous film. The replica of the Myers house is quite impressive. Danny Lux can't beat John Carpenter or Alan Howarth, but his score is better than average and his version of the main theme is eerie. Brad Loree does a great job as the masked madman and is probably the scariest Michael since 4. The writers injected some humor into the mix and some of it works. Finally, Rick Rosenthal does a pretty good job as director and makes the film look quite dark and spooky.Cons As I said above, this film ignores 4-6. Some fans might not care, but I know there are some, including myself, that aren't too thrilled about it. And seriously, does it really fix things anyway? Lacks both suspense and good characterization.

DeMille's work or even what the public reaction was to his career although I've heard a few negative things, and I've heard a lot more negative things about this picture's Best Oscar win (since it won over such AFI top 100 entries as High Noon and A Place in the Sun).The film is somewhat metacinematic It brings the joys of the circus to the viewer in the same way that it does for the audience in the film. With authentic circus acts thrown into the mix, these scenes are very exciting. But the film extends beyond just bringing footage of the circus to a movie audience as it effectively captures the drama backstage and brings you into a unique world.The film is slightly more spectacle than story, in the sense that it sometimes feel like the story is secondary to the lions, tigers, and other circus acts. The plot bobbles through multiple story lines, but mainly centers around circus manager Brad (Charlton Heston), trapeze primadonna Holly (not much of a circus name, I know), and a womanizing Frenchman named Sebastian who becomes the circus' new headline trapeze artists and hopes to steal the heart of the woman she stole the spotlight from. Also featuring heavily into the story are Angel (Gloria Grahame), a past flame of Sebastian; Klauss, an elephant tamer with an obsessive desire for Angel; and Jimmy Stewart as a wise old clown who has been hiding a couple of secrets.Among the cast, Heston, Grahame, and Stewart really stick out for excellent performances. Heston's circus manager is a man of very strong character who you come to empathize with because he's got the careers of thousands of people on his backs and is willing to sacrifice his personal relationships, his health, and his ego (when dealing with cocky people like Sebastian) to see to it that the show is a success. Gloria Grahame brings such wit and sass to one-line jabs and insults that it makes a convincing character out of what would otherwise have been a two-note shill. Lastly, Stewart is classic Stewart but he delivers that Midwestern persona underneath a veneer of make-up and in a supporting role.

In Ran (chaos), he paints his own vision of one of Shakespeare's finest works, 'King Lear'. 'Ran' looks more like an oil painting rather than 'water coloured'. While in 'water' paintings, the colour's are fading, in oil, the colours have a stronger presence signifying their message. He uses various colours to tone the depth of his characters and the relationship between them, to present the mood of the setting and to tell his story. With very brilliantly sophisticated sound effects he brings a raw feel while effectively using the background score in parts. Using his artistic technique, he pays close attention to detail in almost every scene (e.g. the wind, the makeup) without worrying about limiting his final piece to a usual 1.5 hour movie or whether the pace is fast or slow. Of course there must have been some editing but everything in the final piece flows beautifully, revealing a story of love, honour, betrayal, misunderstanding, lust, murder, jealousy, manipulation, greed, madness, redemption, forgiveness and destruction.Tatsuya Nakadai breathes Lord Hidetora Ichimonji. He had starred in many of Kurosawa's films and in 'Ran' he is absolutely a stunner. This is more than an example of great acting because he made me completely forget that I was looking at an actor. Another noteworthy performance is Mieko Harada's as the venomous Lady Kaede. She displays the power of her manipulation and evil intent through her body language while her words are secondary.Immense additional credit must also be given to Kurosawa for skilfully mingling a Shakespearean tragedy into a traditional Japanese historical epic. Clearly he'd done his research well and put a lot of hard work into his painting. The background is signified with much of the Japanese cultures and religious reference.I won't give much of a synopsis as you'll find them in other comments and those who've read King Lear may have an idea. All I'll say that this movie is for those who appreciate real cinema. It is not what others will call 'everyone's cup of tea'. It does make you reflect to the real world how one's expression can be misinterpreted, how life itself is not a happy ending, how dangerous trusting the wrong person can be and how important it is to trust the right person (even a family member), how greed can eat up a person, how the consequences of our actions dictate whether the mistake we made is significant or trivial and how naïve we all are.

For those of you who have heard the general conscientious that Rocky V is not worth watching I strongly advise you to give it a go, the criticism of this film is something that has never really made sense to me. It moves away from the traditional format, (which by the fourth installment had become a series of consecutive montages with badly dated music) and sees Rocky go truly back to his roots even wearing the hat again, add that to a return for Burgess Meredith in some bitter sweet flashback scenes along with a simple but decent storyline and you get a vastly underrated film. Rocky is persuaded by a young contender Tommy Gunn to step back into the world of boxing as a manager and coach. The pair of them get carried away with Tommy's success, Rocky begins to neglect his son and Gunn becomes lured by the riches promised to him by Richard Gant's George Washington Duke, an obvious ringer for Don King. Rocky V takes the franchise full circle and makes note of the obvious changes that have taken place in the world of boxing, and come to think of it, most sports around the globe. It brings a clash of the two types of sportsmen, the old fashioned and the new. The difference in Rocky 5 being that the new uses his skills seeking fame and fortune and forgets what truly matters, a mistake Rocky himself makes in the third film. The main difference however is that Tommy lacks one special ingredient that Balboa has, something that made Rocky endearing to us all in the first place, Rocky has got heart and so has this film. It's also worth pointing out that it hasn't dated nearly as badly as the third and fourth installments and aside from some dodgy late eighties-early nineties rap music it doesn't have much else that ages it. At the premier of the recent Rocky Balboa film I saw an interview with Sylvester Stallone he referred to Rocky V as a bad film and he also noted that when he bought the anthology he threw the fifth one out. Now i'm not going to kid myself and think that the great man is going to ever read this review but ill take the tiny chance that he might one day glance at it to say- Sly, give this one another go its not bad, not bad at all.

It moves away from the traditional format, (which by the fourth installment had become a series of consecutive montages with badly dated music) and sees Rocky go truly back to his roots even wearing the hat again, add that to a return for Burgess Meredith in some bitter sweet flashback scenes along with a simple but decent storyline and you get a vastly underrated film. Rocky is persuaded by a young contender Tommy Gunn to step back into the world of boxing as a manager and coach. The pair of them get carried away with Tommy's success, Rocky begins to neglect his son and Gunn becomes lured by the riches promised to him by Richard Gant's George Washington Duke, an obvious ringer for Don King. Rocky V takes the franchise full circle and makes note of the obvious changes that have taken place in the world of boxing, and come to think of it, most sports around the globe. It brings a clash of the two types of sportsmen, the old fashioned and the new. The difference in Rocky 5 being that the new uses his skills seeking fame and fortune and forgets what truly matters, a mistake Rocky himself makes in the third film. The main difference however is that Tommy lacks one special ingredient that Balboa has, something that made Rocky endearing to us all in the first place, Rocky has got heart and so has this film. It's also worth pointing out that it hasn't dated nearly as badly as the third and fourth installments and aside from some dodgy late eighties-early nineties rap music it doesn't have much else that ages it. At the premier of the recent Rocky Balboa film I saw an interview with Sylvester Stallone he referred to Rocky V as a bad film and he also noted that when he bought the anthology he threw the fifth one out. Now i'm not going to kid myself and think that the great man is going to ever read this review but ill take the tiny chance that he might one day glance at it to say- Sly, give this one another go its not bad, not bad at all. Rocky V is certainly not deserving of being chucked out of the anthology, in fact it deserves its place in there, it deserves to share a box with the rest, more so that Rocky Four anyway. While this film may not have the emotional punch of Rocky Balboa it certainly isn't worth disregarding. If your one of the many that skipped this one, go on, give it a go, you might be pleasantly surprised.

Why aren't there more of them - the format is ideal for translating a six-thousand-word short story into half-an-hour of film, and this movie is a great example of the genre - fun, exciting and varied. The first piece, Quitters Inc., is the most fun, with a killer premise - what if gangsters decided to get into self-help therapy - what methods could they use. The second, The Ledge, is a classic crime\/suspense story in the vein of John D. MacDonald or Joe R. Lansdale. And the third, The General, is a wonderfully creepy little fairy-tale with a terrific tiny monster. Director Teague takes all the best aspects of Stephen King's script and turns in three great tales, quickly dumping the action and moving onto something new as soon as the yarn is spun. He is aided by a terrific cast, with Woods, McMillan and Clark all shining, and great special effects by Carlo Rambaldi. Zestfully shot by legendary cameraman Jack Cardiff (A Matter Of Life And Death, The African Queen, The Vikings, etc) and full of good-natured fun, including plenty of jokes at King's expense; for example, Woods watches The Dead Zone on TV and laments, I don't know who writes this crap !. Whilst this is not Citizen Kane, for what it is, it's a near-perfect little triptych of fun-filled comic-horror episodes, and solid entertainment by a very underrated director. Quitters, Inc. and The Ledge are adapted from King short stories appearing in his 1978 book Night Shift, whilst The General was an original script written for the movie.

I remember watching they original and being very intrigued.When I recently heard about the sequel, though it's very old, I jumped on the opportunity to watch this. Now, I'm only fourteen, but I just loved this movie (and Jonathan Scott-Taylor). This is definitely a movie that I'm going to record on video to watch again, and again. On to the movie itself. It was very well acted and had good graphics for it's time. People rag on some of the death scenes, but I have to say that I was impressed with what they had. Maybe Joanne's death was a little silly, but I liked that you could even have a little bit of a laugh. I thought all of the characters were well acted, and that Jonathan Scott-Taylor was, in my opinion and a decent amount of others, the best Damien to hit the screen. With his eyes and black hair, he really set the feel of being the Antichrist. He was really, really good. The thing that I loved was how Jon made you almost feel bad for Damien. Like, when he killed Mark and then let out a strangled yell. There were even tears. It was especially heart-wrenching that Damien didn't even know he was the Antichrist until half-way through the movie. It was so sad when he screamed at the top of his lungs why it had to be him that was born of the devil and a jackal. Overall, it was a strong movie and I highly recommend it to people who enjoyed the first film, have an open mind and aren't to hard on things like this. Afterall people, it's just a movie. It's mean't to be fun and enjoyable. Just relax and be a little less RAWR!, 'kay? ^ ^~Haley~ ","genre":null},{"date":"1 June 2007","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" I have to say that as fan of horror movies (whether they be new or old), I loved this sequel.
