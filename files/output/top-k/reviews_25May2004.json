He is one of the best, but at the same time, one of the most underrated Shakespeare directors. All of Franco Zeffirelli's films, but particularly Shakespeare adaptations, seem to reflect his artistic soul. All of them are very individual interpretations of the great English playwright. The most famous, probably, is ROMEO AND JULIET (1968) which is one of his earliest films, except for THE TAMING OF THE SHREW made two years earlier. However, while some people may see something dated in the two above mentioned films, HAMLET is, no doubt to say, exceptionally good not only thanks to direction but thanks to its new convention and absolutely great performances! Isn't acting the critical factor when concerning Shakespeare's plays?Indeed, most cast give breathtaking performances. Glenn Close, Alan Bates, Nathaniel Parker, and Helena Bonham Carter shine in their roles. I also loved the performance of Ian Holm. They all play naturally and the action moves fluently. No moment seems to be boring although most viewers know the story perfectly well. But among the cast, one man is really extraordinary, thanks to whom the film does a great job. That is Mel Gibson in the main role. Though known for his roles in Lethal WEAPON, FOREVER YOUNG and many other films, I think that the role of Hamlet is his finest performance so far. Watching this film, you will see that he really felt his role heartfelt. Franco Zeffirelli knew whom to give the main role. I even dare say that all other portrayals of Hamlet seem to be in the shadow of Mel Gibson's portrayal in this film. Once you see him in this role, you will never forget him. I promise you that!Another great acting talent of the movie is Glenn Close. The character of Gertrude is really difficult to portray and I admire Glenn, particularly the way she expresses the change of heart. First, living in lie with Claudius, the murderer of her first husband, and then, realizing the guilt. Consider her face expressions, particularly, in the last scene when she is poisoned and regrets her evil deeds. Alan Bates is also exceptionally memorable as Claudius. He portrays a man ready to wickedness, but also ready to doubt the righteousness of his deeds. And yet, Helena Bonham Carter. What a portrayal of Ophelia's madness! These eyes! Really impressive performance worth your attention!There is one more factor that comes to my mind when thinking about the movie ... the lavish luxurious costumes. There is a gorgeous wardrobe in the film, which is certainly not the most significant thing in the film, but taking into account that it is Zeffirelli's movie, wardrobe is an important point. Remember his BROTHER SUN SISTER MOON (1972) or THE TAMING OF THE SHREW (1966)? There are similarly rich costumes in HAMLET.I would recommend Zeffirelli's HAMLET to everyone. If you liked ROMEO AND JULIET (1968), you will love this movie. A must-see for Zeffirelli's fans, a must-see for Gibson's fans! Yet, a must-see for all movie fans who know what a good performance is!

I have been impressed with quite a bit of Spielberg's work (save that of A.I.) but have not until Minority Report paid attention to where the ideas came from.  The reason I did so with this movie was that the plot was so fantastic and bursting with creativity that I was almost compelled to investigate this source of its genius, Philip K. Dick.  Spielberg made this literary gem into a feast for the eyes.  No stone seems to go unturned in creating a realistic world of the future.  From cars to advertising to appliances, Spielberg assembles it all.  And to garner some of the best that Hollywood has to offer, he enlists the services of Tom Cruise.  Cruise plays the protagonist, Detective John Anderton, in a futuristic tale of a world where a crime can been predicted.  A precrime bureau is assembled to stop that which hasn't happened yet - future murder.  Anderton's embrace of precrime is due to the loss of his only child, who was abducted.  When Anderton stumbles upon a flaw in the precrime system, he is setup and hunted down by his own agency.  The story begs the question that if you knew the future, is it predestined that you would still make the same choices, despite your knowledge of what was about to happen?  Can you change the course of events to come?Detective Anderton discovers that not everything in life, now or in the future, is merely black and white and that no looking-glass ball is perfect.  For a wild roller-coaster ride of a movie that has some of the most creative and plausible ideas of the future, I highly recommend you watch Minority Report.

There's nothing truly outstanding about any one aspect of the movie; nothing that will blow you away. However, everything is put together perfectly.Personally, I have a theory that any movie that absolutely blows you away the first time you see it, will lose its entertainment value very quickly. Not necessarily because the movie was not good, but because it just seems to get old too fast. This is NOT one of those movies.This is the kind of movie that will be enjoyed countless times. The dialogue is slick, and always to the point. There are few (if any) overdone scenes and\/or lines that tend to become annoying over time.This movie flows exceptionally well.

It was performance art on the world's smallest possible stage, usually involving an audience of only one or two. -- Obituary for David Hampton, Associated Press Saturday, July 19, 2003 In SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION, Paul, a con artist passing himself off as the son of Sidney Poitier, has a wonderful monologue. He goes into detail describing a nonexistent thesis he claims to have written about the book The Catcher in the Rye and about how its themes have become a manifesto for violence. It is a beautifully written piece by playwright\/screenwriter John Guare that Will Smith does so well that you might not at first realize that it is really about the character that Smith is actually playing. Catcher's Holden Caulfield is a liar, but he hates phonies; wants to be liked, but mostly shows contempt for others; and he complains that people just don't see what is obvious. Holden sees himself as one person, but reveals himself to be someone quite different. So does Paul.SIX DEGREES, play and movie, is based on a true incident. David Hampton pulled the Sidney Poitier scam in the early 1980s and insinuated himself into the lives of various affluent New Yorkers. His hoax was eventually revealed and the result for Hampton was a jail sentence and, thanks to Guare's fanciful play, minor celebrity status. Told mostly from the viewpoint of the generous, star-struck and gullible people that Hampton scammed, personified by the fictitious Flan and Ouisa Kitteridge (Donald Sutherland and Stockard Channing), the film apparently expands on monologues from the play, opening things up so that the tale slowly becomes a minor New York urban legend. As the Kitteridges compare notes with other victims of Paul's masquerade, the legend grows and the story shifts from anger, to amazement, to giddy amusement, before turning suddenly tragic.For the most part the film is a gentle comedy, not that far removed from the screwball farces of the 30s and 40s which found basically good people falling for lovable rascals who brazenly assume false identities. The message was that respectability is only skin deep; true integrity lies much deeper. SIX DEGREES embraces that ideal by making Paul's con game basically harmless, a plea for acceptance and identity, not a petty swindle. As long as the film maintains this sense of innocence, it is an utterly charming tale. But like Paul, the filmmakers reach beyond their grasp and the film falters. The film has problems, which standout all the more because of the intelligence of the overall quality of the production. It is jarring, for instance, when we are introduced to the various children of the main characters, because they are shown to be loud, bitter and antagonistic. Since the adults are shown to be so nice, albeit self-absorbed, it is hard to believe that they are all supposedly to be lousy parents. Certainly these college kids are meant to represent a contrast to Paul's overt politeness, as well as illustrate a generation gap, but the kids are just too overwhelmingly unpleasant and ungrateful. Their scenes ring false.Also, Ouisa at one point angrily insists that the entire story has to be more than just a cocktail party anecdote; yet in the end, that is all that it is and that is how the film unfolds. It is a stylishly told tale, made all the more intriguing because it is based on the truth, but the film strives to romanticize it all of out of proportion. It is suggested that what would rightly be no more than an amusing footnote in these characters' lives, should be treated as mythic tragedy.  The film ends on a particularly ridiculous note, wherein Ouisa apparently walks out on Flan because he doesn't share her belief that Paul's story has been a life transforming experience. We are to assume from the ending that her encounter with Paul has been a liberating experience that has awakened her to the shallowness of her life and the emptiness of her marriage. This is absurd, especially the latter part; Flan and Ouisa are depicted as being deeply devoted to each other throughout the story, making her sudden exit inexplicable. But feminist cliche dictates that liberated women must abandoned their husbands. Channing is, as always, just wonderful in the role of Ouisa, and she almost makes the character's impulsive behavior seem credible. But, in the end, we are left befuddled like Flan, not irate and angry like Ouisa. It is a pity that Guare and director Fred Schepisi weren't satisfied with simply letting the story be a gentle satire on our celebrity driven society. It seems they had to somehow justify making the film by creating fake drama out of real life farce.

Like it's a bad thing.  Perhaps living on an island in Scotland does not equip one to understand or fairly criticise a southern Californian car-cult movie.  And he's 36, ...too old to enjoy TFATF by about...oh, twenty years?  I am 61 and I thought it was a fun movie.  In New Mexico, we know A LOT about custom cars, low-riders and high-riders, and we understand how (and WHY)one might put tens of thousands of dollars into creating a really boss machine.  Sure, TFATF is pure science fiction, the science being the cars and the fiction being the likelihood of scores of custom race car afficionados being able to commandeer a deserted street for a midnight race.  But yes, the car cult does cross race and ethnic lines, because it's all about the cars....  And so what if the film has a lot of product placement?  Personally, I didn't even understand half of what the characters were talking about when it came to custom engine parts.  The movie does one thing very well  it entertains.  Obviously.

I was talking to my brother about Jackie Brown, Quentin Tarantino's follow-up to Pulp Fiction. He said the movie bombed because people didn't think it was as good as Pulp Fiction and made less money. Although many were disappointed that it didn't rise to Pulp-like statue, and that it didn't make as much money as it (less than 20%), but does that automatically make Jackie Brown a terrible movie? No. On the contrary, it's a nice departure from the frenzied pace of Pulp, and shows Tarantino's growth in this medium.Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is a flight attendant at a small airline. She works in transferring money via the airline, but soon she is caught. In order to reduce, or eliminate her sentence, she helps the police get Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson), an arms dealer, put away. However, with the help of bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster), she starts to play both sides like a modern-day Yojimbo. Plus, Robert De Niro using a large bong!Tarantino takes a breather between Pulp and the Kill Bill movies here with a (for the most part) nonviolent drama. It's slow, but it's refreshing. In the age of quick cuts and techno music that's overused, it's good to see a film like this. The pace is slow, sometimes too slow for its own good, but it never gets boring or tedious. The movie does have a few stylish flairs, but it looks low budget, and feels low budget. This movie seems normal-none of the wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am dialogue that made Pulp so famous. There's almost no memorable dialogue in Jackie Brown, but does that mean that it's a terrible movie? According to many people, yes. In my opinion, no.The thing is, although Jackie is about 20 minutes too long, it's entertaining throughout. The script, based on Elmore Leonard's Rum Punch, keeps our interests throughout, mainly because of Pam Grier. Her endearing work makes the movie worth watching. Her no-holds-barred attitude in the movie makes it continually interesting. Jackson puts in an average show-nothing can top Jules Winnfield. De Niro looks like he's doing a favor for a friend-or Tarantino just wanted him in the movie. But chronically stoned Melanie (Bridget Fonda) put in a good job. The acting's not as good as previous Tarantinos, but for the most part, it's good.So, let me sum up everything I've said.

The film is filled with surreal offbeat images - the killer sphere that drills into victims' heads and sprays the entire contents of their brains out behind it; the sinister figure of the Tall Man who is always shot striding along in slow-motion to the accompaniment of huge booming drumbeats; his finger that still wiggles after being amputated and then mutates into a malevolent insect; hands exploding out of walls and graves to grab people and so on.An example of the wonders you can achieve on a low budget, Phantasm was scripted (and edited, and shot) by its young director, Don Coscarelli, who wasn't afraid to give his imagination free rein in the story department. Starting off in the time honoured manner of many horror films, with its youthful protagonist trying and failing to convince anyone, but especially his older brother, that evil is present in their small town, it works itself up into a relentless series of bizarre setpieces, without bothering to pay much attention to having it all make sense.Coscarelli sets a wonderful atmosphere in Phantasm. What scarier place can one conceive of other than a mortuary and its cemetery.
