[{"date":"7 December 2011","score":"","review":" What is it about cartoons failing financially at the movies? What is missing in the transition from the TV to the big screen? Is it the lack of substance? Or could it be that a cartoon's charm is only limited to a twenty-minute time slot? I'm not quite sure myself but it is disappointing that most adaptations to the big screen end being a flop. Thankfully there are some that try really hard to stick to the old and not involve the characters in a non-cartoony plot.A movie that can mirror this kind of description would be The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle. Sure this movie has not gained a whole lot of appreciation but for the fans who truly respect the original series, you can see why this movie is one of those live action cartoon movies that stands out from the others. How come? Because the film uses its goofiness from its original episodes and uses it throughout the film. This movie is similar to The Muppets (2011) movie plot. Over a certain length of time, Rocky and Bullwinkle have been forgotten in the past until they are needed again 35 years later. So has anything really changed character-wise in this movie, absolutely not. Rocky, Bullwinkle, Fearless Leader, Boris, Natasha and even the narrator are all in this movie. Even the screenplay between all live action characters are like the original. After a misunderstood conversation between Rocky and Bullwinkle, the narrator states, Yes even their word play had become hackneyed and cheap and then Bullwinkle replies to the narrator, No, it was always like this. Oh how right you are Bullwinkle!Aside from the main cartoon characters, Piper Perabo who plays Agent Karen Sympathy is given the assignment to get the daring duo out of the cartoon world and into the real world. The mission to stop the nefarious Fearless Leader played by Robert De Niro. De Niro is actually a wise choice for the role of Fearless Leader. I truly can't imagine another actor playing that part. Fearless Leader is a difficult cartoon character to mimic verbally and physically so I give De Niro credit for that. Jason Alexander and Rene Russo team up as the Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale. They too both mimic their cartoon characters fairly well.So what is there about this movie that makes it a good cartoon adaptation? Well besides the main cast, there are many famous actors that make cameo appearances. A couple that come to mind are John Goodman, Billy Crystal and Don Novello. Some play multiple characters while others play only one. Either way, this movie has a lot of star power.The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle may look like another worthless cartoon adaptation but it sticks to its roots and gives all that it has. Thanks to a good cast of actors, not only are the cartoon characters supported but it also makes its cheery screenplay work well too.

MOONSTRUCK not only picked up an Oscar for Cher but the screenplay also won as did Olympia Dukakis for Best Supporting Actress. I'm not going to call this a bad movie because the performances are way too great and there's no question that the screenplay has some great dialogue but I must admit that I'm quite confused by some of the praise this film has received. It seems most reviewers see this as a four-star movie and some consider it one of the best of the decade and there are even some who consider this one of the greatest movies ever made. I thought it was charming and sweet at spots but I can't help but think it's highly overrated by many. While the dialogue might have been terrific and could have been the reason it picked up the Oscar, I thought the story itself wasn't all that impressive. What really kept me from connecting with the movie was the fact that I really didn't care about any of the characters. The love triangle between Cher and the brothers really wasn't all that interesting nor was the issues going on between her parents (played by Dukakis and Vincent Gardenia). I thought that all of the characters seemed to be trying to spoof the Italian stereotypes and it just didn't work for me as it didn't make me laugh nor did it make me care for those I was watching. With that said it might sound strange that I'd still recommend the movie but there's no question that the performances are great. Cher not only perfectly nails that accent but she also manages to be very believable in the part of this widow. I thought that inner toughness she brought to the role was great and she also shares some great chemistry with the supporting cast. Dukakis is good in her role but I thought it was Gardenia who nearly stole the film as the cheating husband. Aiello could play this type of role in his sleep so there's no issues with him. Cage is the main reason to watch the movie as he perfectly nails the part and also manages to get quite a few laughs and especially early on when we first meet his depressed character. Director Norman Jewison handles the material quite well and keeps the film moving at a nice pace. MOONSTRUCK is obviously a film loved by many.

It draws a lot of influences from both the original book and the classic short from Chuck Jones.The basic premise is the same, the creatures called Whos all love Christmas, but The Grinch does not so he tries to ruin it by taking all the decorations and presents away. But there are a lot of tweaks they did to expand the story. This movie goes into detail of The Grinch's past, as a child he had a crush on a young girl Who and tried to impress her during Christmastime. But all the other kids laugh at him causing him to eventually snap and take out all of his aggression on the holiday. Not the best origin but it could've been a lot worse.We also get a sort of contest the Whos do every year at Christmas called Whovalation, which Cindy Lou invites the Grinch to. Without giving too much away(for those select few who haven't seen the movie yet)these scenes can either be viewed as a interesting interpretation of the original story or be seen as a blatant attempt to make the movie longer than an hour. In fact the Grinch doesn't don his infamous disguise and steal the presents until the movie is thirty minutes from finished.This movie is either a hit or miss for most people. For me, I thought for what it was it was a pretty good movie. Sure they could've toned down the adult humor(compared to Cat in the Hat though, it's nothing)but they did manage to capture the spirit of the book by the end of it. Jim Carrey does an acceptable performance of The Grinch while giving his own comedic flair into the character(which again is hit or miss). The rest of the supporting cast does well to give the movie a unique feel. The visuals of Whoville and Mt. Crumpit are very pretty and feels just like a live action Dr. Seuss book.Overall this may not be a movie everyone can enjoy but if you take it with a grain of salt and get past some of the crude humor you might have a good time with it. I've liked it ever since I was a kid and it continues to be a guilty pleasure.

Personally I don't think it's the BEST western but it is very close! The plot goes like this; A politician famous for shooting a criminal, Liberty Valence, heads back to the town where he shot him. Journalists meet him and ask him questions. Instead of answering them The senator tells them the whole story...The man who shot liberty valence was, what you could call, an end of an age film. Black and white films were slowly becoming obsolete and colour films were dominating Hollywood. This is probably one of the last GREAT black and white films.John ford cast some of the best actors in history and I think this is why i love the film so much. Lee Marvin, John Wayne, a cameo of lee van clef and my all time favourite actor James Stwert. Because of the confusing advertising, it's hard to know who is the main character- John Wayne or James Stewart. Although John Wayne has some good line, bold acting and plays a fantastic performance, James Stewart really steals the show. He acts like it was the last film he will play in, acting with so much expression and oozing with talent. He acts similarly in one f his earlier films, Mr Smith Goes To Washigton which would make since because both characters he plays are politicians. In this film he plays the character I would like to be; A justice seeking, kind, generous fellow who is not afraid to stand up to injustice. By and large;One of Stewart's best performances. John Wayne's character,Tom Doniphon. He really pulls it off. Although he is the supporting character, he's plays more like an acquaintance to James Stewart rather than a friend which keeps the film diverse. Tom Doniphon encourages the senator to fight a gunfighter who is causing some trouble in the town. The senator doesn't like the delinquent himself, but shooting him conflicts with his beliefs and this is why he doesn't appeal to Tom Doniphon as many western characters would. They play like chalk and cheese and it's just brilliant to watch.There is no action involved in the film. Instead we get a suspenseful, on edge, thrilling sequence which keeps you wanting to know if James Stewart's character will take up the gun and end the villain or if the villain will shoot him in cold blood. It's rather intriguing and will keep you glued to the screen.This was John Ford's last black and white film. Boy, did he go out in style.If your a action western junky, the chances of you liking this film are low. There are a lot of political moments and it may feel a bit long for some. However if you just like westerns in general this is a enjoyable western that not only exposes the injustice of the west but makes a daring, admirable character who stands up to it.

There's not much reason for that. It's possibly the best movie of this type I have ever seen. It just seems too outlandish and too over the top to give it a perfect score. And yet, at times (and for a good part of the last half hour or so) this movie isn't just frightening - it's downright terrifying. Director (and co-writer) Tobe Hooper did a marvellous job of building this from a quiet and almost slow beginning (which was effective in and of itself) into a movie that causes you to squirm, wince and turn away on a regular basis - and he does it all with the use of fear rather than gore, because there's actually surprisingly little gore involved in this. This movie is about terror - pure, primal terror, absolutely superbly depicted by actress Marilyn Burns, who played Sally, who's the last of the main characters to meet the family. Her performance and moreso her depiction of terror is absolutely chilling.As I said, the movie starts slowly. A narrator actually begins, reading words that are already displayed as white letters on black background. What could be more everyday and even pedestrian as that. The narration gives this a cold, perhaps dull, and definitely documentary feel. The opening scenes are creepy rather than frightening - a graveyard has been desecrated; corpses interred and dismembered - but no explanation as to why or by whom. Five young people come on the scene. Travelling in a van they chat about life - and a lot about horoscopes. Capricorn is being captured by Saturn, or some such astrological mumbo-jumbo, but we get the point - things are out of whack in the cosmos, and something bad is going to happen. Picking up a weird hitch-hiker along the way, the five are introduced to this strange family of psycho cannibals, and the terror ensues. The first appearance of the killer makes you jump, and ultimately leads to a last half hour that is absolutely riveting, and no less exhausting as we watch Sally desperately trying to escape from this madness that she's fallen into.I loved the ending to this. There are no loose ends tied up; and there's not going to be a dead killer coming back to life. In the end, the terrified Sally simply escapes in the back of a pickup truck while her chainsaw wielding pursuer runs after her and then, having given up, waves the chainsaw around madly. Sally is left terrified. The movie ends abruptly, but somehow you're left satisfied that you've been taken on one of the great rides in horror movie history. Wow!

Director (and co-writer) Tobe Hooper did a marvellous job of building this from a quiet and almost slow beginning (which was effective in and of itself) into a movie that causes you to squirm, wince and turn away on a regular basis - and he does it all with the use of fear rather than gore, because there's actually surprisingly little gore involved in this. This movie is about terror - pure, primal terror, absolutely superbly depicted by actress Marilyn Burns, who played Sally, who's the last of the main characters to meet the family. Her performance and moreso her depiction of terror is absolutely chilling.As I said, the movie starts slowly. A narrator actually begins, reading words that are already displayed as white letters on black background. What could be more everyday and even pedestrian as that. The narration gives this a cold, perhaps dull, and definitely documentary feel. The opening scenes are creepy rather than frightening - a graveyard has been desecrated; corpses interred and dismembered - but no explanation as to why or by whom. Five young people come on the scene. Travelling in a van they chat about life - and a lot about horoscopes. Capricorn is being captured by Saturn, or some such astrological mumbo-jumbo, but we get the point - things are out of whack in the cosmos, and something bad is going to happen. Picking up a weird hitch-hiker along the way, the five are introduced to this strange family of psycho cannibals, and the terror ensues. The first appearance of the killer makes you jump, and ultimately leads to a last half hour that is absolutely riveting, and no less exhausting as we watch Sally desperately trying to escape from this madness that she's fallen into.I loved the ending to this. There are no loose ends tied up; and there's not going to be a dead killer coming back to life. In the end, the terrified Sally simply escapes in the back of a pickup truck while her chainsaw wielding pursuer runs after her and then, having given up, waves the chainsaw around madly. Sally is left terrified. The movie ends abruptly, but somehow you're left satisfied that you've been taken on one of the great rides in horror movie history. Wow!

Repo Man is a quirky science fiction comedy film about a young punk rocker named Otto who finds himself employed as a repo man after helping to steal a car.

Repo Man is a blast from beginning to end, never slowing down and never letting up on the antics. It doesn't waste time being sincere.

Having no money and playing the harmonica apparently will. But then again, this was made for Depression-era audiences, so the notion of money as the root of all evil and being happy derived without benefit of money must have been a sure crowd pleaser in its time. Very populist, right down to repeated crowd shots of everyday folks in a courtroom scene. Jean Arthur lives with an eccentric, extended family that does not worry about money (although its is made plain early on that family patriarch Lionel Barrymore earned quite a bit of moolah in his time, so no one in this crazy family need worry about where their next meal is coming from or whether they will have a roof over their heads. Heck, they even have a pair of black servants! Arthur falls in love with her boss at the bank, played by rising start Jimmy Stewart. Stewart's stuffy old dad, bank president Edward Arnold, is all about money and status, nothing else. A plot element has Arnold trying to buy Barrymore's house for some nefarious project. Arthur insists on Stewart's family meeting her family before they tie the knot. You can imagine what transpires when they finally gather (collide might be a better word) for dinner at the Barrymore household. We get a little bit of A Christmas Carol thrown in when an old tycoon and crony of Arnold's, now destitute, confronts Arnold about his greedy and sinful ways. For this scene, the camera is stationed behind and to the left of the old tycoon, with Arnold standing several feet away intently and silently listening to him. We never get thee expected reverse shot as the tycoon delivers his sermon. Only after he finishes his speech and turns to leave, do we see him plainly. In this way, the fellow seem almost spectral and unreal, like Marley's ghost, and this makes his speech all the more powerful. Or maybe it's just me. A stellar supporting cast includes Donald Meek, Spring Byington, Mischa Auer, Eddie Anderson, Harry Davenport and several others. By today's standards, the film is much too preachy and dated.

Director Jeremiah Chechik, working from a screenplay by John Hughes (who'd written the first Vacation and co-written the second), does a great job of mixing some genuinely poignant moments into all of the farcical highlights. There's some very quotable dialogue, especially from Clark and Eddie.It's great fun, too, to see so many familiar faces in this large cast; lovely Beverly D'Angelo is fine as usual as the long suffering wife Ellen; also appearing are Juliette Lewis and Johnny Galecki as the latest incarnations of Audrey and Rusty, Diane Ladd, E.G. Marshall, Doris Roberts, Miriam Flynn, William Hickey, Sam McMurray, Nicholas Guest, and Natalia Nogulich. Mae Questel, long ago voice of Betty Boop, is a riot.Christmastime simply wouldn't be complete without a viewing of this personal favourite. It starts out brightly and keeps the momentum going for a very enjoyable 98 minutes. In the words of Eddie, it's the gift that keeps on giving.Eight out of 10.

When considering the possibilities for a desperate father, hellbent on getting his kid something for the holidays, why did they have to go with such a tough guy like Schwarzenegger? Couldn't they pick someone who looks geeky and innocent like Rick Moranis? It's no fun when the desperation comes from some giant, intimidating man who, when smiles, appears to be in a permanent sarcastic state.Jingle All The Way remakes that faithful Christmas where Cabbage Patch Kids and Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers were selling like hot cakes in local toy stores. The mass sell out encouraged fights and I'm willing to bet many kids didn't get the one present they were hoping for. The story replaces the Kids and the Rangers toys with an ultra-cool TurboMan action figure equipped with the shiniest plastic around and five different phrases.Howard's (Schwarzenegger) son Jamie (Lloyd) wants nothing but a TurboMan action figure for Christmas, but Howard is such a workaholic that he completely forgets. His wife Liz (Wilson) is also getting tired of his work is more important than family attitude. Howard lies to Liz about getting the toy, and now spends his entire Christmas Eve frantically running around in search of comedic inspiration and a TurboMan action figure.The plot is very slim, and seems like it would be perfect for a twenty-two minute episode of Full House.

So, they return home with another similar toy, Stephanie opens it on Christmas and complains. The three men then tell her the true meaning of Christmas, and she becomes a bit happier, than by some miracle Kimmy Gibbler or someone gets her the bear and the credits roll.The same comic setup and ability could've been provided in twenty-two minutes, and didn't need to be extended into a feature length film. Jingle All The Way has the energy to make a fair attempt to carry the setup, as well as its ability to present its characters as likable people. What it doesn't do is show the true meaning of Christmas. The premise is very materialistic, and the characters always act on present emotions.This is holiday-fluff, and that's perfectly fine. Little kids will enjoy it, and parents will get the chuckle if they remember holiday shopping experiences like this one. It works both ways. Energy comes in mass amounts, the ending is cute, and colors are vibrant. But the fight scenes, like the one between Arnold and the con-Santas are tiring and relentless.

Wilbur is a doctor that performs abortion's which was highly frowned upon during this era. Homer learns the ropes while still yearning to experience the real world outside of the orphanage, all while Wilbur dreams that Homer will partner with him and ultimately takeover when he is gone. The theme of this film is that your heart always brings you back to where you're supposed to be. For example, Homer enjoyed leaving the orphanage and falling in love with Charlize Theron's character Candy, but knew in the end he had a responsibility to the patients and children of the orphanage and returned. Homer had the chance to experience life outside of his normal routine and realized that his abilities and gift to be able to help women in need when faced with an unwanted child was bigger than being in love for a short period of time. During Homer's journey working on the apple farm he is forced to help a young woman named Rose. Rose was raped by her father (Delroy Lindo), and Homer performs the abortion on Rose so that she does not have to live with the memory of her father molesting her throughout her lifetime. After the surgery is over Rose runs from the apple farm without looking back, after her father realized he ruined a large part of her life, he takes his own life. While these dramatic events are taking place Homer is informed that the other man in Candy's life Wally (Paul Rudd) is coming back from serving in the military, because he was injured and is paralyzed from the waist down. Once Homer realizes that Candy needs to be there for Wally he decides to return to the orphanage and use his gift of surgery to good use. The lighting in this film is more high-key because many scenes are taking place in an infirmary type location. The lights are bright so the audience can further their imagination to the stress and realism to what these women and medical staff are experiencing. Also the angle used during the film is mainly filmed straight on, because the lack of action packed scenes. This film is realistic, so to really get the audience involved it is best to keep it simple and believable.

These two films revolve around being there for your friends and family when needed. Hallstrom does an excellent job portraying that you have to take the good with the bad in both of these films.

The beliefs on abortions child birth are also representative of the time period. The plot revolves around Homer, and is about him trying to figure out what he wants to do with his life. The lighting and color are soft which adds to emotions of the film. The narration at the beginning of the film really sets a tone for the audiences' emotions and was played a significant role in getting the story and giving the emotion to go with it. This may not be Spiderman for Toby McGuire but still one of his best performances.In conclusion this is an amazing film, with great actors and crew. It takes place during the 1940s. It tells the tale of Homer Wells picking a direction in his life outside of the place he grew up in, and finally returning to the orphanage after experiencing many new things, and meeting several different kinds of people along the way.

Like the sinking overtones of its very ominous score and title sequence the viewer is pulled through each perfect frame by this future attractor until the ultimate fade to white. And that is really the scary thing about this film, its perfectly realized vision of beauty. The plot is a loose extract from Arturo Perez Revertes 'The Club Dumas'. The book deals with an altogether more complex tale that if transfered as a direct carbon copy to the screen, would have been bloated and far too complex to sandwich into any kind of workable narrative\/runtime. The tale here instead focuses on just the one book and is much better for it. I give this a score of eleven. Just as Lucifer made his perch over god, and with all great works of art, this one went over the critics heads. In time however I feel this will stand as Polanskis finest film, and certainly among the greatest of all time. ","genre":null},{"date":"7 December 2011","score":"","review":" Ah the Devil.

Clichéd, predictable, and just downright stupid at times. The story begins as you would expect...a couple driving out in the middle of Texas. They meet some weird people at a gas station. Next thing you know, they are being chased by maniacs with chainsaws. This film has got little going for it. The script was so bad, I was actually laughing out loud. It was as if they decided to throw in the lamest, most overused, clichéd lines of dialogue they could have. I was actually able to predict word for word what the last line of the film would be, and that is never a good thing. A couple of scenes were entertaining, but nothing like any of the scenes from the first two films. There were some decent acting performances, but nothing I would remember. I would not recommend this film to anybody, as it was just totally boring and borderline pathetic.

It's a movie titled 'Black Knight' and it stars Martin Lawrence so what was people expecting other than silly fun and some entertainment? Not surprisingly there are plot holes, historical inaccuracies and the dramatic moments are overly melodramatic (twhich was annoying) and the story is obviously far-fetched but for me the humour worked and 'Black Knight' has plenty of it. Admittedly Martin Lawrence can go over the top to the point of being very annoying but here I found him to be quite entertaining. Tom Wilkinson isn't given much to do but he does get his opportunity to make the viewer laugh. I particularly found him in his introductory scene. Luminous Marsha Thomason is very cute. I'm not saying that 'Black Knight' is among the best time-travelling comedies. It's certainly nowhere near classics like 'Back to the Future' or 'Les Visteurs' and it could have been way better where writing is concerned but 'Black Knight', as daft as it is, made me laugh many times which is why I don't mind it.
