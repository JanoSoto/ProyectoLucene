It gives something away that is supposed to be a mystery until about 40 minutes into the movie! This movie is cool in that it's one of those suspense thrillers that limits the number of protagonists and does away with all but superficial sub-plots in favour of fast-paced, exciting chase sequences. As one reviewer said, it grabs and doesn't let go.We begin in the city. Sidney Poitier plays Warren Stanton, an FBI, or G man, called in by the local cops to investigate a suspicious diamond theft - the owner of the store apparently stole his OWN diamonds. It only takes a stern gaze from Stanton for the store owner's resolve to break, and he spills the beans a man has kidnapped his wife, and is holding her to ransom while the owner goes and gets the diamonds.Stanton intervenes, and tries in vain to negotiate the woman's release with disastrous consequences, and the man makes his escape. We know immediately this guy is dangerous, that's evident from the way he executes the maid, but what we soon learn is that he is extremely smart as well. Except for one huge mistake, which ultimately cost him his life even though he makes said mistake about 20 minutes into the movie...but anyway...nitpicking! I'll talk about the mistake in a sec.The man escapes into the Pacific Northwest wilderness, hooking up with a troop of holiday fisherman being led through the rockies by a guide, Sarah (Kirstie Alley). Cut off from outside communication, there is no way to warn Sarah or her fishermen that a dangerous killer walks among the group.Stanton, in the meantime, enlists the aid of Sarah's boyfriend Johnathan Knox (Tom Berenger), a rugged mountain man type, to lead him into the wilderness in pursuit of Sarah, who (unknowingly at first) is harboring a psycho.Interestingly, the Australian release title of this film, Deadly Pursuit, was more fitting i thought. Now, the mistake the killer has escaped, basically...he's in the woods, he's killed a fisherman for his clothes, he is gonna join the fishing guys and Sarah and basically hijack the adventure holiday to get himself over the border into Canada. Now, why on Earth would he shoot the fisherman in the left eye (being the EXACT SAME way he executed the diamond-guy's wife) thus tipping the authorities to the fact that it's the same guy responsible. For the smart guy he's made out to be, it seems a bit far-fetched that he would leave such an obvious signature. Maybe a bit of lazy writing which I can kind of forgive, given that the rest of the film is so good. Or maybe I'm way off and it's just that this killer is a bit of an idiot and egotist who WANTED Stanton to know it was him. Either way, it's a great chase\/adventure through the mountain wilderness, with some great photography and several key stunt sequences that really work. Stanton's fish-out-of-water stuff provides some comic relief, like the moose scene, and the what the hell are these? - Battery powered, heated socks, the latest thing! The music is also good, fitting to the action and the pace of the film. Kirstie Alley is good as the tough mountain chick, who is pretty good at looking after herself, and shows that she's not all talk once the kidnapper reveals himself to her. Tom Berenger plays another tough guy role here with enthusiasm. He's a rugged character, tough as nails and you feel his commitment to finding Sarah at all costs. You want him to get his hands on the kidnapper-guy, because you just know he'd kick the sh*t out of him in three seconds, gun or no gun! Anyway...that wouldn't be as exciting a movie I suppose! So a couple of things stretch believability...but they are minor unless you are really opposed to that kind of thing...in which case maybe don't hire action-thrillers? The only one that's a bit strange is having the 50-something Sidney Poitier take like 6 gunshot wounds to the torso (and I'm talking, like, a 9mm here, not a .22 or a pellet gun) and yet is still able to wrestle a 30-something, uninjured man over the side of a ferry and then proceed to hand-fight him underwater and finally kill him, all while holding your breath (you'd wanna hope one of those bullets didn't puncture a lung!) and once he's disposed of, get yourself back on board only to collapse just in time for some paramedics to put a stretcher under you...okay...but anyway, like I said, this is an ACTION-THRILLER...not a documentary or hard-hitting war drama, so I can forgive some minor plot discrepancies and liberties here and there, because, all in all, this is just a damn good film! It's worth mentioning that the script is co-written by Daniel Petrie Jr - a great mind of the action genre.It's great in that for the first 40 minutes or so, you as an audience member do not know who the killer is among the band of fisherman. Once you do know, it's like the gloves come off and this film kicks into high gear for the final thrilling chase sequence as the killer makes his desperate dash for the border, Stanton and Knox only a step behind... In having a tricky reveal like that, you kind of limit your audience as far as replay value is concerned, so I can sort of understand why this movie is kind of forgotten today. Once you know the twist why bother watching it again? I say for the performances, the setting, the adventure...I've seen this movie probably 20 times growing up and again just last night, and I can still say I enjoy it immensely.

Really the only things that keep me personally from fully embracing it is its unrelentingly morose style, which seems sometimes too heavy-handed for the material, and the jarringly non method performance from Vivien Leigh as Blanche Dubois, the faded aristocrat whose last refuge is the exceedingly humble apartment rented by her sister (Kim Hunter) and her abusive husband Stanley Kowalski (Brando). Karl Malden puts in my favorite performance as ________, a relatively gentle member of Stanley's clique who secretly loathes his own affability and sometimes obedient disposition.Now I hasten to clarify myself because I don't think Vivien Leigh is a bad actress or that she gave a poor performance in the film. On the contrary in the handful of her movies I've seen she's been more than adequate and in this movie she was exceptional. But her acting is decidedly different from the type of method acting that everyone else is doing, and to me that made her performance seem oddly out of place. In some ways I could accept the argument that the film benefits &#150; after all, Blanche really is from a different world than Stanley and his friends. But the difference between her performance and her sister's (Hunter) is equally jarring and there's no intrinsic explanation for that. I think it takes the film down just slightly, but obviously this is still a classic film full of memorable performances.I particularly like Malden and I think he among all the principals was able to figure out how to work with Leigh, which makes it all the stranger that he says in the commentary that he preferred Jessica Tandy from the original cast while Brando preferred Leigh. I guess Brando found Leigh sultrier, sexier&#133;. I think I'd rather see Tandy.I guess I really don't have a lot to say about the film. It feels pretty stagey but not as bad as some other 50s films of this type (theater adaptions) I've seen like Separate Tables or All My Sons. Kazan coaxes a great performance out of Kim Hunter, who never really rose to that level again (maybe she wasn't given the opportunity? Most movie fans know her mostly from her work on the Planet of the Apes series). He gets a fantastic performance from Malden, a good performance from Leigh, and an enigmatic but powerful one from Brando. Whatever Brando was doing, he made me absolutely HATE the Stanley Kowalski character. I wouldn't be able to spend more than 5 minutes in the same room with that animal. And frankly it was difficult watching him on screen. That's not bad, but it's also not hugely enjoyable. I didn't find him to be a fascinating sort of villain, just the type of scumbag who actually fill the streets of our cities. That's just depressing, but I suppose the character is worthwhile in the service of the larger story of Blanche. Basically I thought Brando did good work but the character is too one-dimensional, despite his realism. He's not all that interesting to me because he has no potential for change or growth, either for better or for worse.So it's a good movie that accomplishes what I think it's attempting to accomplish, but not the type of thing that I personally would hold to my heart and watch again and again. I'm glad to have finally seen it though.

Whatever Brando was doing, he made me absolutely HATE the Stanley Kowalski character. I wouldn't be able to spend more than 5 minutes in the same room with that animal. And frankly it was difficult watching him on screen. That's not bad, but it's also not hugely enjoyable. I didn't find him to be a fascinating sort of villain, just the type of scumbag who actually fill the streets of our cities. That's just depressing, but I suppose the character is worthwhile in the service of the larger story of Blanche. Basically I thought Brando did good work but the character is too one-dimensional, despite his realism. He's not all that interesting to me because he has no potential for change or growth, either for better or for worse.So it's a good movie that accomplishes what I think it's attempting to accomplish, but not the type of thing that I personally would hold to my heart and watch again and again. I'm glad to have finally seen it though. BTW those who enjoyed this film should seek out Baby Doll, from the same director and writer and featuring Malden in a sort of comedic version of his character in Streetcar opposite Eli Wallach. Not really better than this film necessarily but I enjoyed it more.

Mulholland is a hugely regarded example&#133;I didn't like it. It was a complicated, self-indulgent mess and seemed David had pieced together random ideas after dropping acid. Blue Velvet is in the league of his hugely regarded group of films &#150; a lot of people are familiar with the title, perhaps also having seen it. I had heard nothing but acclaim, and had been advised by a few movie-goers to see it. And now I've seen it, I am still in awe. So much so, I want to go back and bear Mulholland to see if is actually worthy of my time&#133;maybe even the dreadful Lost Highway.Granted, Blue Velvet is very bizarre. Yet, it is not totally bizarre that the viewer has no idea what is going on and has to go consult message boards and websites to crack the plot (if there even was one in the first place) like Mulholland Drive or Lost Highway. And it still has depth.David Lynch, maybe you're not a loony, but an artist actually capable of extraordinary work of art. Blue Velvet is the best you have to offer. This is truly deserving of its status as a classic. In my very short 18 years, this is the best movie I've ever seen.

Being a fan of the earlier thrillers without an overload of gadgets and CGI and especially the gritty 60s\/70s Italian movies, I've tended to avoid the blockbuster fare. But, this is good, there are plot holes and a little silliness but who cares when the action whips you along. Maybe this or that is not quite right but do we have time to sit and ponder? Do we heck! No irrelevant love scenes, no long sequences to try and explain how this really is realistic. We don't care. If we get a car chase through the streets of Paris with enough decent dialogue for us to become involved, we'll never complain. I think that possibly shooting so much in Paris also has altered the way the film feels and maybe forced the director's hand a little, thereby making this look and feel a little more European. Never a bad thing. Now for the other two!
