Jean-Claude Van Damme is back, in this outstanding sequel to Universal Soldier. This movie has everything rising conflicts, an intense climax, and a no-nonsense denouement. It has an attractive, Belgian born hero, who gets right to killin' and doesn't waste the viewers' time with wit, correct grammar, or clear, understandable English. It has a suppressed, perhaps even dubious, romance between the two lead characters, so as to keep us wondering when they will climactically embrace. I often found myself on the edge of my seat, clinching the arm rests in anxious anticipation, crying aloud to the character Just kiss her, damn it! The movie has the audience-demanded, token movie complication of a best friend turned into bad Sci-borg, who becomes a threat to our protagonist and must be eliminated but miraculously comes back at the end to save our protagonist when our hero faces certain death! The bad guys (though I realize this is a passe, barbaric description, and that such distinctions are merely a matter of perspective and it is entirely non-PC in this postmodern day and age) were completely convincing in that they made me believe they wanted to take over the world and kill everybody. It has brilliant comic relief. For example, when one antagonist would be foiled in his mission, he would frustratingly utter about the protagonist, Boy, I really hate that guy. Throughout the movie it became funnier each time he said it, until, finally, about the seventh time he said it, I was rolling in the movie isles. It also has unpredictable twists and turns, for example, I never expected for the bad guys to kid-nap the hero's daughter all the way up until the point when the movie established that the hero had a daughter (I was completely taken off guard!). The intensity of this movie is evident when the opening scene takes us through a room filled with every hazardous chemical known to man, which are contained in small tanks with such terrifying, esoteric technical labels as acid. This is ingenious symbolism interwoven into the film by the director that represents the danger and high stakes involved. It communicates, This movie is bad A! The writers obviously performed countless hours of meticulous, in-depth research in order to portray mankind's most advanced, high-tech recent developments in AI and computer technology or at least they heard about someone else whose cousin knew some lady whose husband did do such research. Either way, it shows, and they deserve the credit. The movie obviously brings up pertinent issues and moral dilemmas dealing with our computer age and combines this with the originality of its warning, to wit, someday your computer is going to go bad and decide to annihilate mankind. This unsettling realization has certainly made this reviewer a believer, and from now on I'm going to keep a closer eye on my computer. One can only hope that this movie has the box office success that it deserves, so that Hollywood won't hesitate in churning out even more classics of this sort (fortunately, whether it is a success at the box office or not, Hollywood knows what is great movie making and I don't think low box office sales will stop them from continuing to make great films like this). I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, as did my friend who is a scatologist, who said, It is one of the most interesting specimens I've ever encountered!

Then they cite the 'thumbs up' and the dodgy robot sentimentality. And after this they point out how much tougher The Terminator is, as if it's devoid of corn. Are they forgetting what a drip Linda Hamilton is in this film ('guard it for me, big buns')? Are they overlooking how cheesy the romance between Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese is? Do they forget how embarrassing Sarah's flatmate is? None of this spoils my enjoyment of what is a great film, but the nitpicking of Terminator 2 and the concessions that are made to The Terminator baffle me somewhat &#150; both are fantastic action movies, but both have their flaws.Watching it for the first time in years, the thing that made me laugh the most about The Terminator was the romantic relationship between the hero and heroine. In one scene Reese tells Sarah that he came through time for her ('coming' through time almost being literal, as his appearance in the film has him shaking, with steam pouring off him, like he's experienced an earth-shattering orgasm), and then after he admits to being a virgin, and to carrying a photo of her around with him, they have some tearful sex as a piano version of the title theme plays. Woah. So basically Reese has come through time to fulfil a masturbatory fantasy of popping his cherry with his boss's mum; a boss who is also, unbeknownst to him, his son? Well, I guess snatch is as good a reason as any to save the world.But the fact that Reese is a virgin makes me ponder what the resistance is doing in this post-apocalyptic world. Surely such a dire situation would call for prodigious breeding. Strapping young men would surely be required to service young ladies aplenty to help perpetuate the species and build the army (and what better release after fighting lots of gnarly robots?). But alas, from what I can gather, the human army doesn't have any such program.

And indeed we do. My favourite killing has to be that of the gun store owner. 'Which will it be?' the man asks. 'All', says Arnie. And then when Arnie begins loading one of his guns the man tells him he can't do that. 'Wrong' is Arnie's pithy reply. Wonderful! A close runner up to this is when the Terminator kills the first Sarah Connor. 'Sarah Connor?' he asks, and then when she replies 'Yes', he blows her away.

","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"29 March 2007","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I took a course in eighteenth century English lit several years ago, and one of the first pieces we studied was Daniel Defoe's pamphlet The Shortest Way with the Dissenters, a satirical piece he had anonymously published. Defoe wrote in the voice of his opponents, denouncing his own group (the dissenters) and proscribing outlandish punishments and generally pushing for their extermination, while heaping considerable historically inaccurate praise on his foes. Yet as absurd as his suggestions were and as woefully misguided his praise was, the satire completely went unnoticed. His opponents who he had intended to satirize adopted the pamphlet and lauded it as a fresh look at the problem. His own political\/religious group was horrified. Then, when it inevitably came out that he, an outspoken dissenter, had written the piece, the satire became all too evident and his flustered opponents had him pilloried and thrown in jail. Defoe had made the dire mistake of underestimating the potential for evil of those he was criticizing and thus his satire became invisible for those who were not looking for it. What has all this to do with Starship Troopers, you may ask? Well, as far as Robert Heinlein's novel goes, it has precious little relation, but then the same could be said for this film which, while preserving character names, locations, lines of dialogue, and plot points from the novel, it is no more an adaptation of Heinlein's novel than Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a true story. However, Paul Verhoeven, like Daniel Defoe before him, has crafted a work of satire that is largely invisible to most viewers, leading to a critical and commercial failure that more or less finished him in Hollywood. What is most troublesome is that not even those associated with the film, apart from Verhoeven and Neil Patrick Harris, seem to have any realization that what they are doing is satire. They go about their roles with the gravest sincerity. This leads to such great moments as when Michael Ironside intones with the utmost conviction and solemnity 'They sucked his brains out.' They're acting in a good old' fashioned war propaganda picture, much like Michael Bay's dubious Pearl Harbor, but the director was making another film altogether, the direct opposite in fact. Starship Troopers is at once an anti-propaganda film satire as well as an ongoing checklist of sci-fi and war movie clichés that over the course of the film escalate to an insane degree. Verhoeven was in some ways retreating to the safety of his first big North American success, Robocop, with its absurd ultra-violence, media criticism, and carefully concealed subversive satire. The trouble is, bringing us back to the example of Defoe, is that with the satire invisible, this is a troubling and unpleasant film that seems to target the lowest common denominator. There are many things to recommend about Starship Troopers. The special effects are shockingly well-done for the most part, including stunning cgi effects for the bugs which are still impressive today. Neil Patrick Harris does a slyly comic turn as Carl Jenkins, who unlike his character in the novel, has become a psychic SS agent, and there is a bizarre cameo by The Golden Girls' Rue McClanahan as a Dr. Strangelove-esquire biology teacher. The wide-eyed sincerity of the rest of the cast also makes for fascinating viewing, as if they were making their way through a forties b-picture with a plot line that seems like a high school drama club's adaptation of Heinlein's story. There are also a lot of things wrong with the movie. For starters, the lame costume design of the troopers, of which the less said the better. The alien effects, while often stunningly well-realized, are occasionally oddly cartoonish (the same can be said for the prevalent gore). Mostly, the storyline is a jumbled patchwork mess that takes huge leaps of logic and the characters are Styrofoam replicas of actual human beings ('More meat for the grinder', as their recruiting officer says). However, if one can entirely dissociate it from the novel after which it is vaguely patterned, and is fully aware of the director's intent (as opposed to the intent of all others involved), this is an intelligent film and both a funny and deeply disturbing satire.

The black plastic phone rings. It's a potential client, a law firm. Do I know what an attorney is? Sure I know what an attorney is. It's like a lawyer but the bucks are bigger. The lawyers names are Winesap and Macintosh -- two apples. A long-forgotten crooner is missing. He owes the lawyers something and they want Harry to track him down. A missing person case. Harry meets the client in the loft of an Evangelical black church in Harlem. It's Robert DeNiro overly decked out and trying on an elegant accent. The story soon gets complicated. People begin to turn up with oddball names -- Proudfoot, Johnny Favorite, Evangeline Krusemark, Toots Sweet.So far, we feel we're on pretty normal ground here. A Raymond-Chandleresque mystery will follow, during which we'll lose sight of the original problem while we meet eccentrics, goons, and pre-verts, and we'll be taken down colorful paths into mansions and down into spooky basements and people will be knocked off for reasons we don't understand.Well -- yes, but with two or three twists. One twist is that the next thing we know, we and Rourke are out of Brooklyn and into New Orleans and environs. Another twist is that the story moves into the orbit of the supernatural -- voodoo, black magic, mummified hands, pentagrams, Satanism, selling one's soul to the devil, and all that -- and it's meant seriously. I mean the devil is real and is a real character in the film. (Why he insists on meeting Rourke in a Catholic church and warning Rourke against using the F word in such a place isn't entirely clear.) The third twist I won't reveal except to say that the people who made The Sixth Sense might have seen this ending.It's a weird movie, overall, teetering on the brink of being arty. Off-kilter shots of ventilator fans slowly creaking to a halt. Rain turning into blood for no apparent reason. Murders committed for no apparent reason either. And not only that, but the victim's heart is cut out and left on the floor. There's a thin line between beauty and baseness, and at times this film and its editing go beyond atmospheric into plain sloppiness and self indulgence. Much is made of the voodoo thread that leads Rourke to Louisiana but in fact it has nothing to do with the central event of the story, which might just as well have taken place in the apartment of Rosemary's baby.DeNiro is a great actor but he's in the wrong role here, or rather the role is wrong for him. Whatever else he is, DeNiro is always grounded. But here his lines are written as if meant for somebody like Clifton Webb or George Sanders. Mickey Rourke -- whatever happened to HIM? He's very good in this, as he was in many of his earlier films. The next thing we knew he had a new raggedy haircut and a pair of boxing gloves. What a loss for us. Lisa Bonet is beautiful and sexy and demonstrates how well suited she was for a television sitcom. The musical score is pretty good except at times, during moments of dread, we get a booming heart-like sound that's guaranteed to induce at least a headache and at most a gallop rhythm.There's another loose end to the plot that keeps nagging me. I can't understand why any of the murders were committed.And another. Why does Mickey Rourke wind up having to pay his dues when in fact he's not the same guy who signed the contract? He has a different face and a different brain and a different set of memories. He doesn't even KNOW he's the guy who first made the deal. Is he held to the contract because he happens to have the same set of fingerprints? Somebody tried to ploy the system once in Connecticut after a sex change operation and were foiled because of that simple dermatographic fact.At times it's a little tiresome but it's worth catching if you haven't seen it, especially if you're unfamiliar with Mickey Rourke's talent, curious about Lisa Bonet's bosom, or a fan of the occult.

The black plastic phone rings. It's a potential client, a law firm. Do I know what an attorney is? Sure I know what an attorney is. It's like a lawyer but the bucks are bigger. The lawyers names are Winesap and Macintosh -- two apples. A long-forgotten crooner is missing. He owes the lawyers something and they want Harry to track him down. A missing person case. Harry meets the client in the loft of an Evangelical black church in Harlem. It's Robert DeNiro overly decked out and trying on an elegant accent. The story soon gets complicated. People begin to turn up with oddball names -- Proudfoot, Johnny Favorite, Evangeline Krusemark, Toots Sweet.So far, we feel we're on pretty normal ground here. A Raymond-Chandleresque mystery will follow, during which we'll lose sight of the original problem while we meet eccentrics, goons, and pre-verts, and we'll be taken down colorful paths into mansions and down into spooky basements and people will be knocked off for reasons we don't understand.Well -- yes, but with two or three twists. One twist is that the next thing we know, we and Rourke are out of Brooklyn and into New Orleans and environs. Another twist is that the story moves into the orbit of the supernatural -- voodoo, black magic, mummified hands, pentagrams, Satanism, selling one's soul to the devil, and all that -- and it's meant seriously. I mean the devil is real and is a real character in the film. (Why he insists on meeting Rourke in a Catholic church and warning Rourke against using the F word in such a place isn't entirely clear.) The third twist I won't reveal except to say that the people who made The Sixth Sense might have seen this ending.It's a weird movie, overall, teetering on the brink of being arty. Off-kilter shots of ventilator fans slowly creaking to a halt. Rain turning into blood for no apparent reason. Murders committed for no apparent reason either. And not only that, but the victim's heart is cut out and left on the floor. There's a thin line between beauty and baseness, and at times this film and its editing go beyond atmospheric into plain sloppiness and self indulgence. Much is made of the voodoo thread that leads Rourke to Louisiana but in fact it has nothing to do with the central event of the story, which might just as well have taken place in the apartment of Rosemary's baby.DeNiro is a great actor but he's in the wrong role here, or rather the role is wrong for him. Whatever else he is, DeNiro is always grounded. But here his lines are written as if meant for somebody like Clifton Webb or George Sanders. Mickey Rourke -- whatever happened to HIM? He's very good in this, as he was in many of his earlier films. The next thing we knew he had a new raggedy haircut and a pair of boxing gloves. What a loss for us.

And since then, E.T. has been stuck in my head, for all the wrong reasons! The first time Elliot sees E.T. in the Cornfield was a scene that would become my worst nightmare for 10 years.

The acting is very good for a kids film (which I usually look upon with utter distaste), and certainly, I don't think there has been a decent film about good Aliens since (apart from maybe the rather overlooked Cocoon).

One of those books - A Confederacy of Dunces - has earned a formidable reputation as a whacked-out, satirical masterpiece (it even won Toole a posthumous Pulitzer). His other book, The Neon Bible, is far more obscure, sincere and frankly melancholy. I like both books, even though they're very different in terms of style.So, I was naturally quite excited when I stumbled upon the DVD release of this movie; I wasn't even aware that any of Toole's work had been adapted to film. But I was also a little wary. Movies have a tendency to trivialize great books, and I predicted that The Neon Bible might, in cinematic form, degenerate into a depressing slog.Alas, my prediction proved true. This movie is a slog. Director Terence Davies paces it like a funeral procession. He also fills the movie with weird, protracted shots of blackness, of whiteness, of starry skies; I imagine he's trying to be deep somehow, but all his slow zooms just bore me. Besides, at times he overplays the starry sky thing so much that it looks like the protagonists live in a cabin in outer space.Both the book and the movie are anecdotal, but the book works because David - the shy teenage hero - makes an interesting narrator. His voice binds the anecdotes together, and naturally the reader learns about him through the narration. In this movie, though, he's largely silent; he just lurks around in the background of his own story. And, without his narration, the anecdotal scenes often make little sense and have no apparent connection.I feel guilty about badmouthing this film, to an extent, because it at least strives for faithfulness. But the deadly slow pace really undermines everything. For instance, there's a Christian rally at one point, headed by an evangelist called Bobby Lee Taylor. In the book, this is a rousing set-piece, and Taylor is depicted as an energetic young man who really seems to believe the (ahem) propaganda he spouts. But, in the movie, Taylor is depicted as a lifeless old man, and he basically announces to the audience in an aside that he's a shyster. Ho-hum. That's the Hollywood trivializing machine at work. And the scene as a whole completely lacks energy, verve, oomph - whatever you want to call it.This is going to sound like a strange statement, but I'm starting to develop a love-hate relationship with movies, with the emphasis on hate. It's always easy and tempting to pop a DVD in my player and relax for the evening, but I find lately that I get a lot more out of indulging in the brain-stimulating alternative pastime of reading. After all, books are, on the whole, lots better than movies. Case in point...The Neon Bible. I still can't stop hoping that, one day, they'll make a movie version of Confederacy of Dunces.

(the closer to photorealism a human-like creation is, the more subconscious unease people tend to experience with it when it is not a perfect reproduction; i.e. creep factor)2. USAmerican audiences have the attention spans of children or worse.3. USAmerican audiences are typically negative about science fiction (because there is, admittedly, lots of crap out there that is classified as science fiction and because good science fiction requires an amount of suspension of disbelief and greater than average general knowledge).4. Hard core fans of the game series this is spiritually based on were totally vicious in bashing the film as it was not directly based on the very long history and details of the game series. Check out Final Fantasy VII Advent Children (out on DVD) to see where the connections are. Advent Children is a CGI film. It doesn't take the photorealism approach, going instead for the anime look more common to the game series. It looks quite beautiful. This may be what the gamers are more likely to embrace.5. USAmerican audiences are typically less educated or more disinterested in intellectual pursuits found in films because they are looking for a mindless escape for their movie-going experience (understandable, but it is not my personal style and story-telling is meant to be richer than mind candy escapism).This film is an incredible accomplishment. i would have preferred it to be longer and more developed but it satisfied quite well for what it is. If you can get over the 5 issues above, try this film. You may find that it needs to live in your DVD collection as it does in mine.Science Fiction fans may need to add a little more suspension of disbelief here, if they are hard science fiction oriented; as the title suggests, this film deals with a scientific concept of actual spiritual energy. Not my thing, but done well enough that i loved the film, none the less.Last remarks This film is truly beautiful in its concepts and visuals.

Welcome to the Dollhouse remains a counter-piece for his latter work Happiness, using similar techniques, and incorporating related themes Solondz knows how to make his viewers cringe at the misery of which they are viewing. You see, Solondz uses comic-relief to deal with a serious problem because it is a way of making the film easier to cope with and also crafts a more detailed environment.Welcome to the Dollhouse follows the trials and tribulations of an innocent oddball, paradoxically named Dawn Wiener (Heather Matarazzo) and details the stark and painful realities of these forced-to-be outcasts in society. Dawn is a girl who is forced to cope with constant misery day after day and regular disillusionment from her fellow family members. Although she is strikingly peculiar in her looks, she strikes the viewer as an innocent and kind child. Ultimately she receives unjustifiable psychological torment and repulsive treatment from the cruel world she has become distanced from, all due to the way society has immorally perceived her. The film follows Dawn's bleakly funny journey of how she deals with her insecurities and learns to deal with the pain in her life.For the people who were bullied during their school life and were left to practically despise their childhood the film works as a message to them, a poignant message of sympathy and pity. For the people who were the bullies in childhood, the film works as a study of why bullies behave in the way they do, also pitying the bullies, while also making the bullies realise why they should feel guilt for the vindictiveness they forced upon their victims. And for the people who were neutral it will make you remember what happened around you during your time at school. There is no denying that everybody at some point in their life has received some sort of spitefulness towards them, yet Welcome to the Dollhouse offers the opportunity to realise just how unlucky some children really are. I can honestly say that Welcome to the Dollhouse is a film that should be taught to teenagers at some point during their school-life. It would surely make bullies think twice before they picked on the innocent and also gives the bullied a sense of hope.Although delightfully entertaining, highly amusing and terribly insightful Welcome to the Dollhouse is not a film for everyone. I will not deny that some viewers may find the film nasty and too demanding for viewing. Although this is an intentional and important element of the film it does mean that some might wrongly assume the film to be cruel. For anybody studying sociology or psychology, Welcome to the Dollhouse is about as appropriate and perfect as it gets, offering detailed discussion topics and observant analysis. Sadly there will be people who relate to Welcome to the Dollhouse and so it might be too painful for them to watch. Yet, it might make them realise the mind behind the bully and give them some comfort and humour to their past anguish.Ironically dry like the counter-piece Happiness, Solondz uses a similarly exaggerated visual style, echoing naturalistic tendencies to depict the dishonesty and the fake-air of the life surrounding us. The script is truly startlingly, offering an audacious reality-bite of bold lines and crafting detestable society members. Young actress, Heather Matarazzo gives off a vibrant and delightfully funny performance as Dawn Wiener. She is perfectly cast and slides into the role with such freedom and versatility. You can tell Solondz has crafted the script with a blissful elegance so that the actors and actresses have the freedom to make the characters their own. Solondz is very observant of his characters and visually emphasises their features using different technical methods (e.g. the clothing). Solondz has the utmost understanding of the narrative and one would assume that the film might be personal to his own experiences as he seems so knowledgeable of the characters. Welcome to the Dollhouse also attacks school systems, studying the flaws, ignorance and biased nature of educational power.Few films will strike such sympathy through devastation by pulling at your emotional-cords without an ounce manipulation. Welcome to the Dollhouse is a horribly realistic slice of life, provocative, compelling and daring in every sense of the word.

Someone has to stop him, and there's only one man dangerous enough for the job - Inspector Harry Callahan ...This is the original and best psycho cop movie, a landmark in action films and crowd-pleasing adult thrillers, a key role for Eastwood (he reprised it four times), an amazing timepiece of west-coast America in the early seventies, and probably the most influential crime thriller ever made. Its importance in Hollywood terms can't be overestimated. Half of the crime movies made since copy it - the idea of the renegade tough guy cop with nothing to lose who's maybe just as crazy as the perps he's chasing simultaneously allows for great action scenes, intriguing characters and social commentary. What makes this film so good is the character of Harry Callahan - he is the hero, but is he really the guy you want protecting you ? He gets the job done when no-one else can, but at what cost ? Unlike so many imitators (Lethal Weapon, Bad Boys, about a zillion others), the movie doesn't give its hero any redeeming qualities - he's just a crime-smashing maniac. The key scene is the one in the football field, which culminates in one of the greatest shots ever done - a stunning helicopter pull-back of Harry grinding his heel in the killer's stab-wound to extract the information he wants, fading into a murky grey as the line between hero and villain is quite literally blurred. Eastwood is about as close to perfect casting as you can get - it's impossible to imagine anyone else playing this role, although ironically the part is nothing like Eastwood the man, and when he played roles closer to home (such as Bronco Billy or Honkytonk Man) his films weren't as popular. There's good support from Guardino and Santoni, and Robinson is fabulously nasty as the evil Scorpio (check him out also in Hellraiser). There's also a great little unbilled bit by Albert Popwell as the unfortunate blagger in the classic I gots to know bank-robbery scene. This was Siegel and Eastwood's fourth film together and they were obviously in perfect synchronicity as the movie flows together smoothly, buoyed by Lalo Schifrin's wonderfully scritchy jazz-blues music, a classic seventies score. The location photography by Bruce Surtees is just terrific throughout; somehow both documentary realism (back-of-car and street-scene shots) and moody darkness, and a fantastic travelogue of San Fransisco - Golden Gate Park, City Hall, the Mission District, Mount Davidson. A dynamite thriller, and the best film of Siegel's distinguished career (Riot In Cell Block 11, Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, The Killers, Escape From Alcatraz). It doesn't matter if you're a paid-up NRA member who idolises Harry, or a queasy liberal who thinks he's the original Fascist Pig, this is the movie to go see together and argue about.

Joker told the sergeant he didn't believe in the Virgin Mary, which got him points with the sarge. Being a non-Believer meant the kid is all right. That, of course, is ultra-secular Kubrick getting his atheist propaganda in, something he did in several of his films.After watching several years of the TV program, Law and Order Criminal Intent, it would be interesting (and strange) go back now and see D'Onofrio again. I probably wouldn't recognize him. After watching him as the dignified Sherlock-Holmes type Detective Robert Goren, I don't know if I want to see him back in this role, however!

It's deliberately never stated and is something that is best left up to the viewer to decide. The Bret Easton Ellis novel from which this film is based, caused a stir upon its 1991 publishing, which satirized yuppie culture, Reaganomics-gone-amok, and crass materialism during the 1980s.As it would turn out, Bateman, a successful Wall Street investment banker, finally decides to give into an insatiable blood-lust that begins with the cold-blooded murder of a homeless man, followed by a colleague (Jared Leto), and an assortment of call girls and prostitutes. Why Bateman does these horrific things without provocation, purpose or explanation, is all part of the film's bizarre appeal and is not just for shock value.Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich in Scream) rhetorically asked why did Hannibal Lecter eat people? Why did Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers slash up promiscuous teenagers in their respective film series? So why does Patrick Bateman butcher prostitutes in his apartment? Maybe because he's a pretty sick guy? Who knows. All this can be debated for hours on end in a criminal behavior class (for which I'm reviewing this as part of an assignment) about Bateman's motivations.Bateman does not fit the profile of any known serial murderer before him. He's educated, wealthy, respected by his co-workers, and has a well-preserved body to kill for (no pun intended). So why does he one night, out of the blue, decide to chop a guy's face in two with an ax? Nobody knows, but my theory is that he just does it for because he has an unquenchable blood-lust that he suddenly feels the impulse to give into. To the world at large, however, he retains his businessman persona. To his fiancée (Reese Witherspoon), he's an all right if not somewhat shallow guy to want to be engaged to. He's also very sensible he's often the one to straighten out his colleagues when they make a**es of themselves in public by making racially insensitive remarks.American Psycho takes a shockingly funny and horrific look at Bateman's twisted reality, all without the safety of a net. Director Mary Harron looks at the Wall Street world of male bravado, closet homosexuality, materialism, and masculinity without a single flinch. (Is there anything more blatantly homo-erotic than comparing the print on business cards?) When we look at this world, we wonder Did the '80s really look like this? Did an insane Wall Street investment banker go on a naked rampage, chasing a hooker out of his apartment with a chainsaw?Perhaps they did (I was too young to remember), but Ellis certainly remembered, and caught considerable flak from it. That Bateman is able to wonder why his murder spree goes unpunished, why he can't inflict his inner pain onto an uncaring world and why a detective named Kimball (Willem Dafoe) doesn't think to ask him harder questions about his nocturnal activities, all escape him, and us. American Psycho is a confusing, funny, and oft-shocking expose of a world that is best forgotten in history, but will still be nonetheless fascinating to criminal justice and psychology majors until the end of time.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"29 March 2007","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" American Psycho is a difficult film to review because one, it's never clear whether or not the events in the film are real, or are just a figment of Patrick Bateman's (Christian Bale) warped imagination.

This film is biography of the late Ed Wood Jr the worst film director of all time and his struggle to make it to the top of the film industry world.Now I do have some issues with this film, mainly some miscasting. Sarah Jessica Parker in my opinion could not bring the emotion and feeling of Dolores Fuller. The best quote from her in the film is Do I really look like a horse? It's the best quote from her because it's true Sarah Jessica Parker does look like a horse in this film. While I am a fan of Jeffrey Jones (Ferris Buller's Day Off, Howard the Duck, etc.) I just could not feel him become Criswell. I think Mr. Jones may I have tried to hard to try to be like Criswell, which really hurt his performance.While there were some miscasting problems, there were some actors who really hit the part right. Johhny Depp in my eyes became Ed Wood Jr. and I could just almost the spirit of Ed Wood Jr. in Mr. Depp. I also felt that Martin Landau become Bela Lugosi and in my opinion I though My Lugosi came back from the dead just to do his own part in this film.Overall if you are a fan of Ed Wood Jr. films then you should give this film a chance.

The actions scenes are well shot for a low budget. New York as a semi-dystopian society is convincing, and the music - especially the opening theme - is great. The film is also well-paced, with many memorable one liners and fight sequences.
