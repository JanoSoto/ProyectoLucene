[{"date":"15 October 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Coming into Sugar and Spice, I have to admit I wasn't exactly expecting much- if anything. I was guilty of wanting to see it (hey any movie about cheerleaders that go on a crime spree has my vote of wanting to see it), but mostly because it seemed like it would be nevertheless enjoyable. Well, when sitting down to watch it I won't lie in saying that expecting it to JUST be enjoyable wasn't enough for me. I wanted to have the mind to like it (I love dark comedies, and especially ones they aren't afraid to poke fun at themselves), and you know what? I loved this movie.I will say the moment Sugar and Spice opened I leaned back in my seat, preparing myself to be disappointed. The movie has a very simple (yet perhaps appropriate) opening, and they immediately were jumping into story. Usually I don't fly with that, and even in this movie case I didn't immediately. Then when they started to crank up the cheer leading routines I thought Great, they have this great premise, but they're going to focus more on the cheer leading than the plot. Thankfully- they didn't. What made it start to click for me was the realization that all the characters were going to stay in character. I'm so glad they didn't do the typical cheerleader mean girl, but instead did poke fun at the dim witted head cheerleader (and football star), but keep them on that level where they don't become annoying, too over-the-top, but instead make them likable. This film was hilarious, and you love these girls so much that you want to see them prevail in their life of crime. You feel sympathy for these girls (in particular Marley Shelton's lead character, whom you want to see achieve the all American dream), and they're enjoyable to watch as they are to laugh with.Sure this movie has it's cutesy, almost implausible moments. Plus like I said this movie opened (and perhaps ended) very simple, and for that I wish this movie has been slightly longer. I'll admit that they sort of milked this story as far as it would go without starting to become annoying or TOO over-the-top where it becomes annoying, tiresome, or even embarrassing. The film is very funny, extremely enjoyable, and is a very dark treat.

That will give you an inkling of what a colossal cornucopia of crap this film is.The movie opens with Ray (Vincent Gallo) getting out of prison, though the moment is treated like he's a star high school athlete on the final day of his senior year. Ray hooks up with his girlfriend Addy (Kim Dickens) and then it's suddenly 8 months later and Ray and Addy have joined with two other guys to try and rob the local drug dealer. Curtis (Kiefer Sutherland) is a kill-crazy half-wit and Marcus (Mykelti Williamson) is a black guy with an inexplicable ghetto accent. It sounds like 30% ebonics, 30% Jamaican and 60% speech impediment.The drug robbery goes wrong and Ray and company go on the run, kidnapping a couple named Gordon and Donna (Kevin Pollak and Grace Philips) and hijacking their RV. Rather than act like hostage and hostage-taker, everybody behaves like they're long lost cousins meeting again for a family reunion. Defying all reason and common sense, Ray and company keep dragging Gordon and Donna along with them as the criminals try and sell their stolen drugs and get out of the country before the cops and the criminals the drugs belonged to track them down. The movie then spirals into a pit of idiotic plotting, cheesy drama and unintentionally comic violence that would have fit perfectly into any random episode of Walker, Texas Ranger.In the nigh endless litany of things wrong with Truth or Consequences, N.M., I have to start with the acting. Vincent Gallo is worthless. He has no screen presence and doesn't give an ounce of conviction to any line of dialog he recites. It's like he flunked out of the Quentin Tarantino School of Acting. He's also the least physically attractive guy in the whole cast, whether measured hetero- or homosexually. I've already mentioned Mykelti Williamson's bizarre accent. Most of Kiefer Sutherland's acting in this film is done by his hairdo, though he does let out a Jack Bauer growl on occasion. Martin Sheen plays a mob hit-man and has given better performances doing voiceovers for car commercials. There's not one single second when Kevin Pollak seems like a real person in this story. He could have been replaced by a muppet and not one of the good muppets, like Fozzie Bear. I mean Beaker or Scooter.As for the writing&#x85;well, I'm sure almost all of the words in the script were in the correct order and were accurately punctuated. It's a fiasco on every other level. None of the things that happen in this movie follow any logic except the dictates of the Almighty Plot Hammer. Characters are introduced out of nowhere. Important plot elements are mentioned 30 seconds before coming into play in the story. Foreshadowing is introduced and then abandoned. One clich√© after another is piled up like a Pike's Peak of vapid screen writing. I don't think there's one well written instant in the entire movie.Sutherland's direction is vaguely adequate. Nothing looks really bad but nothing looks really good. You certainly wouldn't ever hire him to direct another film because of his work here, though you wouldn't automatically disregard him because of it either.Truth or Consequences, N.M. is just plain dreadful. Avoid it.
