It is one of the best disaster spectacle I ever saw. When this movie came fully remastered for Blu Ray edition I was happy to watch it again. Because everything is made with CGI today I was afraid that this old school made special effects movie, will look funny, but contrary, it still looks fresh even it is made in 1974. So, after all this years and with all that complex and more than real special effects we have today, this movie can stand proudly without a shame in this modern age. However we can't expect to see something that could pair to today's standards. It is classic and obviously made in golden 70ies, but it still holds that breath take feel and tension with realistic effects. The movie were made with huge budget and with highly acclaimed movie stars from that time. The story is simple, the cast is very good, but not that great, except Steve McQueen who shines among other. There is tension, shocking scenes, scary fire and explosions and scenes that is really memorable. The movie is fast, there is no boredom at all, and good (not so deep) presentation of any important character. This is why classic cinema have its quality, instead of todays shallow and weak character development or none, in most of the blockbuster movies today. Anyway it is delightful to see remastered version of great spectacle, and to remember good times we spent at the cinema. Also for younger generation to witness what was blockbuster movies like without computer generated effects.

This is the lesson, John Keating, the English schoolteacher wants to convey to his students. This movie is one of the best movies I've ever watched. It helps people to face problems and live life as if there was no tomorrow. It teaches us how to enjoy every aspect of life and let nothing ruin what makes us really happy. It is not only entertaining, but it teaches a great life lesson, which is to think for ourselves and stand up for that in which we believe. It is incomparable with other movies and should definitely be watched by everyone. Dead Poets Society was nominated for four Academy Awards. It is from the genre of drama and although it is a 1989 movie, the picture is great and the movie is so stimulating and outstanding, the picture won't even be a problem. The movie takes place in 1959 in the Welton Academy. In this school education is very strict and students are expected to behave in a highly educated and responsible manner. Several of the students have a different opinion regarding the school's education process. When the new teacher comes, everything changes. John Keating is an unconventional teacher who tells his students to tear out the pages of the books and asks his students to stand on their desks to see the world from a different perspective. He introduces the boys to poetry and teaches them new philosophies about life. He encourages his students to follow their dreams, and to not follow what people expect them to do, but what makes them happy. The characters in this film are so realistic; they create an impact in the audience. I hate movies with flat characters and in this movie the character development is really outstanding. Robin Williams plays an excellent job as the professor and interacts very well with the students. In his early life, Williams studied political science before studying theatre in the Julliard School. He later on performed in nightclubs where he was discovered for the role of Mork on the TV series Happy Days. Another important character is Robert Leonard who plays the role of Neil Perry. He deserves acknowledgment and fame and is mostly known as Dr. James Wilson on House M.D. Ethan Hawke is another important character in the movie. He plays the role of Todd Anderson in the movie. Ethan was born on 6 November 1970 in Austin Texas. His acting career started as a mix of theatre work and a mix of serious and commercial movies. All of these actors play an excellent role in the movie. They create an exciting plot, and the move builds up perfectly. At first the movie seemed kind of boring, but as I paid more attention and it advanced it was amazing. It tells a story that nobody should miss. I talks about courage, how we should fight for what we want, and to live life to the fullest. One of my favorite scenes was when the English teacher, Mr. Keating, tells the students to tear the pages of a book apart. In every scene he is an excellent teacher, he makes the class entertaining and the students learn more than you could imagine. They do not only learn about English and poetry, but they learn about life.This movie is heartwarming; it has a full meaning, and is contains great poetry that has life lessons. I believe the most important lesson in this movie is to seize the day. This means to make out the most of each day, as if we would die tomorrow. This relates to doing what you like, what you enjoy the most in life. It is getting apart from what society expects from you, and doing what makes you happy. Another important lesson is to be you. We live in a society in which everyone expects something from you, but the most important thing is to be your own self. It will help in mental and spiritual growth. Challenging the status quo is another lesson. Change the way to see life, make a change in the world, in people. One last lesson is to stand up for others. This will not only be beneficial for the people you help but it will help you feel better. I believe everyone who watches the movie should enjoy it. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to watch it but especially for people above 13 years. This is because someone younger than this will maybe not understand well the meaning of the movie and will think it is boring. I would rate the movie PG-13. This movie is as great as the Oscar Winning movie The Help. Both movies are delightfully different. In The Help, as well as in Dead Poets Society, the characters play an excellent role and the plot is entertaining and fun. Along the movie you will not get bored, it catches the audience's attention due to the fact that they treat interesting subjects. They are memorable movies, that once you watch them you will never forget the lesson and it will change your life. Both teach a wonderful lesson that everyone should take into account in their daily lives. Rating 8.7The criticizer of this movie is Melania Chaves. She is an eleventh grade student at Lincoln School, Costa Rica. She is seventeen years old and will graduate next year from high school. She enjoys watching movies and hanging out with her friends. Her hobbies are playing tennis, running, and playing piano. Carpe Diem!

Filled with great direction,amazing cast,excellent action and a great score Lethal Weapon 2 is a true classic of the Action genre and is one of my favorite films.Set two years after the events of the first film,Lethal Weapon 2 brings back Riggs(Mel Gibson)and Murtaugh(Danny Glover)who now have to deal with South African diplomats who use their diplomatic immunity to do criminal activities. At the same time Riggs and Murtaugh have to watch and protect fast talking accountant Leo Getz(Joe Pesci) who used to work for the South Africans and is now testifying against them. Now Riggs and Murtaugh have to protect Leo and stop the South African diplomats once and for all.Lethal Weapon 2 a film that I have loved since I first saw it when I was a kid and was the film that introduced me to the Lethal Weapon films. Mel Gibson,Danny Glover and Richard Donner have always said that Lethal Weapon 2 has always been their favorite film of the the franchise and it has been my favorite film of the franchise because Lethal Weapon 2 takes the Action and brilliance of the first film and raises it higher giving viewers an intense,powerful and Action packed experience. One of the reasons I think that Lethal Weapon 2 is one of the best sequels of all time and one of the best Action films of all time is because LW2 while a sequel to the first film is different from the first in terms of story and execution where the Action is bigger and louder and much more violent than in the first film. LW2 is a also a great sequel because it works on it's own where it is not necessary to watch the first film because when you watch LW2 you are pulled in by the main characters and you know them as the film goes along. The screenplay by Jeffrey Boam is well-written and filled with great dialog that matches Shane Black's great script in the first film. The Comedy and Humor in LW2 is funny and gives the film a much lighter tone than the first film because of the situations and dialog between the characters Riggs,Murtaugh and Leo a relationship that would go on in the other films and the Comedy and Humor is a great balance to the serious tone of this film. Most Action films during the 80s were known for having a political and social commentary and LW2 is no different with LW2 commenting on South Africa,Apartheid and racism and while the film isn't overly political there is enough social commentary that gives this film an edge. LW2 moves at a great and relentless pace and moves so fast that you barely have time to catch a breath or take a break because LW2 grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the end and that is one of the things I love about the film. Riggs,Murtaugh and Leo Getz are a great trio in this film and the rest of the series because the dialog and situations between the three is hilarious because the personalities are all different. Riggs is crazy and mad,Murtaugh is straight laced and logical while Leo Getz is fast talking and a loud mouth. Leo Getz is a great character because while he talks a lot and annoys Riggs and Murtaugh,Leo is smart and knows how to get things done and sometimes gets things done in a hilarious way. The South African villains in this film are classic villains in the LW series because of their vicious and cold hearted way of doing things and using their diplomatic immunity to do their illegal activities whether it is killing people or smuggling things into the United States. The South Africans are great foes for Riggs and Murtaugh. The Action and fight scenes in the film are brilliant and well-executed and are handled in a much bigger scale than in the first film and every Action scene is suspenseful and exciting and the Action scenes in this film are something you will never forget. The final 20-30 minutes are thrilling and Action packed and is a excellent conclusion that will have your eyes glued to the screen. A great ending to this amazing film.The cast does great jobs in their roles. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are brilliant once again as Riggs and Murtaugh and once again have great chemistry. Joe Pesci is great and hilarious as Leo Getz,with Pesci having amazing chemistry with Gibson and Glover. Joss Ackland(Arjen Rudd) and Derrick O'Connor(Pieter Vorstedt)are menacing and fantastic as the South African villains. Patsy Kensit is great and beautiful as Rika,Riggs love interest who also works for Arjen. Steve Kahan(Capt. Murphy),Mary Ellen Trainor(Police Psychologist),Darlene Love(Trish Murtaugh),Traci Wolfe(Rianne Murtaugh),Damon Hines(Nick Murtaugh)and Ebonie Smith(Carrie Murtaugh)give good performances as well.The direction by Richard Donner is excellent,with Donner always moving the camera and giving the film a great energy and pace while also doing well with the Action scenes. Wonderful direction by Donner.The score by Eric Clapton and Michael Kamen is excellent and intense and fits the tone of this film. A great score by Clapton and Kamen. There is also a great song from George Harrison(Cheer Down)and a memorable use of the Bob Dylan classic Knockin' On Heaven's Door(covered by Eric Clapton,Randy Crawford and David Sandborn).In final word,if you love Action films or the Lethal Weapon series,I highly suggest you see Lethal Weapon 2,a classic Action film and sequel that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10\/10.

Most Action films during the 80s were known for having a political and social commentary and LW2 is no different with LW2 commenting on South Africa,Apartheid and racism and while the film isn't overly political there is enough social commentary that gives this film an edge. LW2 moves at a great and relentless pace and moves so fast that you barely have time to catch a breath or take a break because LW2 grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the end and that is one of the things I love about the film. Riggs,Murtaugh and Leo Getz are a great trio in this film and the rest of the series because the dialog and situations between the three is hilarious because the personalities are all different. Riggs is crazy and mad,Murtaugh is straight laced and logical while Leo Getz is fast talking and a loud mouth. Leo Getz is a great character because while he talks a lot and annoys Riggs and Murtaugh,Leo is smart and knows how to get things done and sometimes gets things done in a hilarious way. The South African villains in this film are classic villains in the LW series because of their vicious and cold hearted way of doing things and using their diplomatic immunity to do their illegal activities whether it is killing people or smuggling things into the United States. The South Africans are great foes for Riggs and Murtaugh. The Action and fight scenes in the film are brilliant and well-executed and are handled in a much bigger scale than in the first film and every Action scene is suspenseful and exciting and the Action scenes in this film are something you will never forget. The final 20-30 minutes are thrilling and Action packed and is a excellent conclusion that will have your eyes glued to the screen. A great ending to this amazing film.The cast does great jobs in their roles. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are brilliant once again as Riggs and Murtaugh and once again have great chemistry. Joe Pesci is great and hilarious as Leo Getz,with Pesci having amazing chemistry with Gibson and Glover. Joss Ackland(Arjen Rudd) and Derrick O'Connor(Pieter Vorstedt)are menacing and fantastic as the South African villains. Patsy Kensit is great and beautiful as Rika,Riggs love interest who also works for Arjen. Steve Kahan(Capt. Murphy),Mary Ellen Trainor(Police Psychologist),Darlene Love(Trish Murtaugh),Traci Wolfe(Rianne Murtaugh),Damon Hines(Nick Murtaugh)and Ebonie Smith(Carrie Murtaugh)give good performances as well.The direction by Richard Donner is excellent,with Donner always moving the camera and giving the film a great energy and pace while also doing well with the Action scenes. Wonderful direction by Donner.The score by Eric Clapton and Michael Kamen is excellent and intense and fits the tone of this film. A great score by Clapton and Kamen. There is also a great song from George Harrison(Cheer Down)and a memorable use of the Bob Dylan classic Knockin' On Heaven's Door(covered by Eric Clapton,Randy Crawford and David Sandborn).In final word,if you love Action films or the Lethal Weapon series,I highly suggest you see Lethal Weapon 2,a classic Action film and sequel that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10\/10.

Filled with great direction,amazing cast,excellent action and a great score Lethal Weapon 2 is a true classic of the Action genre and is one of my favorite films.Set two years after the events of the first film,Lethal Weapon 2 brings back Riggs(Mel Gibson)and Murtaugh(Danny Glover)who now have to deal with South African diplomats who use their diplomatic immunity to do criminal activities. At the same time Riggs and Murtaugh have to watch and protect fast talking accountant Leo Getz(Joe Pesci) who used to work for the South Africans and is now testifying against them. Now Riggs and Murtaugh have to protect Leo and stop the South African diplomats once and for all.Lethal Weapon 2 a film that I have loved since I first saw it when I was a kid and was the film that introduced me to the Lethal Weapon films. Mel Gibson,Danny Glover and Richard Donner have always said that Lethal Weapon 2 has always been their favorite film of the the franchise and it has been my favorite film of the franchise because Lethal Weapon 2 takes the Action and brilliance of the first film and raises it higher giving viewers an intense,powerful and Action packed experience. One of the reasons I think that Lethal Weapon 2 is one of the best sequels of all time and one of the best Action films of all time is because LW2 while a sequel to the first film is different from the first in terms of story and execution where the Action is bigger and louder and much more violent than in the first film. LW2 is a also a great sequel because it works on it's own where it is not necessary to watch the first film because when you watch LW2 you are pulled in by the main characters and you know them as the film goes along. The screenplay by Jeffrey Boam is well-written and filled with great dialog that matches Shane Black's great script in the first film.

I'm guessing just because of how low his voice is. Anyway, Mr. Diesel hasn't played any ordinary characters, at least ones that involve a major role. Pitch Black (2000) and The Fast and the Furious (2001) were the films that propelled him to where he is now, but both characters had abilities that allowed them to be almost superhuman. Here, Diesel plays just a very skilled professional.Vin Diesel plays Xander Cage, a popular stunt artist who believes that the majority of the government's laws don't apply to him. It is because of this attitude that he carries, that makes other civilized people not so fond of him. However, there is one person who finds Cage to be quite beneficial to the US government. His name is Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) and he's got a proposal for Cage. If Cage can infiltrate an evil Russian crew and obtain important information, Gibbons will make Cage's problems go away. Sweet, so in other words, Cage will become a spy! So to become a spy he needs a nickname - how about triple X (xXx) because he has three X's on the back of his neck? That works. It's almost like a new name for the spy genre. Instead of 007, its xXx. Is it appropriate to the character - yes. But honestly, will anyone really find this memorable? I guess some would. It depends on your opinion of the character. Rich Wilkes, the writer of this movie does make the character of Xander Cage likable. It's just odd how he writes the story in a fashion that makes it sound like hiring uncivilized people to do civilized jobs are okay. I mean, sure it's okay if every person who doesn't like authority was like Xander Cage. Why? Because Xander Cage does have moments of character development.But to honestly think that a plan like that could work? I don't know. Anyway, the acting is good. Vin Diesel puts a good performance for a guy who only knows how to be a spy for literally a week (that's what he says). Jackson also is convincing as Cage's boss. In fact, Diesel and Jackson exchange some funny lines with each other so it works. On the flip side, I wasn't charmed by any of the antagonists. Martin Csokas as the main villain is one the most unlikable characters there. Sure he makes himself a good villain but villains can have charm too. There is no charm with this man. His attitude towards society makes Xander Cage's attitude look like fluffy pillows.As for action goes, there is a lot of it. But it feels brain dead every now and then, which can get tiresome. Adding to that is the musical soundtrack. Various artists sound themselves through the film but if you're not a fan of heavy metal or at least heavy rock, you as a viewer will have a hard time enjoying the film because it does come up quite a bit. As for the musical score, it does have a main theme and is effective during sentimental moments too. The composer, Randy Edelman is not a novice to this kind of genre so I have no complaints with how he composed his music. However, I do wish it was more frequent in the movie. The actual soundtrack containing various artists seemed more dominant. Other than that, it's a decent action flick with enough Diesel to fuel your interest. Just expect anything too clever.Vin Diesel does his best to be the next generation of the spy genre but the movie plays big, loud and stupid at times. Not to mention that the villain has nothing to be liked about. It's not all bad, but it could have been better.

Although it's not as good as the first two Lethal Weapon 3 is still a wonderful sequel.Lethal Weapon 3 sees Riggs(Mel Gibson)and Murtaugh(Danny Glover)back once again now having to deal with Jack Travers(Stuart Wilson)a former L.A.P.D cop turned arms dealer. Now with the help Leo Getz(Joe Pesci)and Internal Affairs cop Sgt. Lorna Cole(Rene Russo),Riggs and Murtaugh look to take down Jack Travers at all costs.Lethal Weapon 3 is fantastic Action film that I always liked since seeing it in 1992\/93 especially after loving the first two Lethal Weapons. I can see why some people wouldn't like this one as much as the first two because the first two Lethal Weapon's set the bar so high for Action how do you top those two and where do you go with the franchise. The story for Lethal Weapon 3 Isn't groundbreaking or original by any stretch of the imagination because LW3 follows the same formula of the first two filmsthe hilarious Adventures of Riggs and Murtuagh,lots of Action,a memorable villain and lots of explosions and thrills to satisfy the viewer. With some franchises or film series there is a formula that works and when something works you just don't change it. The film has a great barrel of laughs and humor which is first shown in the beginning of the film which pretty starts off with a big giant bang. It's a great opening that will have you laughing your head off. The characters and the terrific offbeat personalities of Riggs,Murtaugh,Leo and Lorna Cole brings laughs and hilarious dialog just like the second one. While LW3 is a funny film it is also a very emotional film especially with the examination about guns and gang violence and how gang violence or the possession of guns can lead to death. LW3 is also an examination of the great characters of Riggs and Murtaugh and how Murtaugh wants to retire and how it affects Riggs and the relationship he has with Murtaugh while Murtaugh is getting older and wants to retire. This film shows viewers that Riggs and Murtaugh's partnership and relationship is more complex than we thought. What I also love about the film is the addition of the character Lorna Cole as Riggs' love interest because in many respects Lorna is the female version of Riggs like Riggs she loves The Three Stooges,Action and Lorna could be slightly insane like Riggs and that is one of the reasons this film as flawed as it is works because of the chemistry between these two characters and that both characters are pretty much on an even keel when compared to each other. This movie like the other LW films moves at a fast pace and it never slows down once the Action starts and once the Action starts there's non-stop thrills and excitement. The LW films have always been known for great villains and Jack Travis is a great villain because this time instead of being a villain from another country or from the army,Travis is a former cop who is now an arms dealer selling guns and armor piercing bullets that can and will kill cops in a heartbeat and in some ways that make Jack Travers dangerous to not only Riggs and Murtaugh but other cops as well even though he's not as intimidating as the villains in LW1,2 or 4. The Action scenes in this film are great and intense and make the film more suspenseful and insane with great shootouts,explosions and fires all around giving the film a powerful rush. The final 20-30 minutes like the other LW films are great and Action filled and also look at the film and look for the scene after the credits the scene will have you roaring in laughter.The cast does great jobs in their roles. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are brilliant once again as Riggs and Murtaugh bringing the same intensity,laughs and chemistry as in the first two. Joe Pesci is fantastic and hilarious once again as fast talking Leo Getz. Rene Russo is great,tough and sexy as Sgt. Lorna Cole,Riggs' love interest. Stuart Wilson does a wonderful job as Jack Travis,the villain of the film. Steve Kahan(Capt. Murphy),Mary Ellen Trainer(Stephanie Woods,Psychachirst),Darlene Love(Trish Murtaugh),Traci Wolfe(Rianne Murtaugh),Damon Hines(Nick Murtaugh),Ebonie Smith(Carrie Murtaugh),Gregory Miller(Tyrone)and Jason Meshover-Lorg(Young Cop)giver go performances as well.The direction by Richard Donner is excellent,with Donner always moving the camera and using great angles while also doing well in the Action scenes. Great direction by Donner.The score by Eric Clapton and Michael Kamen is effective and intense and goes well with the film. Another great score by Clapton and Kamen. There is also great songs by Sting with Eric Clapton(It's Probably Me),Elton John and Eric Clapton(Runaway Train)and Boyz II Men(It's So Hard To Say Goodbye). Great songs.In final word,if you love Action films or the Lethal Weapon franchise,I highly suggest you see Lethal Weapon 3,a Action-packed,funny and entertaining sequel that's not as good as the first two but you watch again and again with the rest of the series.

The story for Lethal Weapon 3 Isn't groundbreaking or original by any stretch of the imagination because LW3 follows the same formula of the first two filmsthe hilarious Adventures of Riggs and Murtuagh,lots of Action,a memorable villain and lots of explosions and thrills to satisfy the viewer. With some franchises or film series there is a formula that works and when something works you just don't change it. The film has a great barrel of laughs and humor which is first shown in the beginning of the film which pretty starts off with a big giant bang. It's a great opening that will have you laughing your head off. The characters and the terrific offbeat personalities of Riggs,Murtaugh,Leo and Lorna Cole brings laughs and hilarious dialog just like the second one.

Although pictures of Kong from this movie looked awful and I suspected it would be the worst of the King Kongs, as a Kong fan it seemed right that I'd at least see it. I now have, and I was more or less right about it.Unlike the other two versions, this one is set in the '70s, and instead of a film crew, the expedition to Skull Island is looking for oil. They stupidly invest a lot into the oil that it turns out is unusable. Along the way, they pick up a stowaway primatologist (rather convenient) and a shipwrecked bimbo Dwan (Jessica Lange). So this movie robs us many of the characters (and all of the dinosaurs) we know and loved. And why would an oil company bring back a giant monkey to New York for stage shows? Rewriting the story to take out the entertainers didn't quite go smoothly.Again, Kong looks awful- a man in a monkey suit. It must be embarrassing when a 1976 film is soundly defeated in special effects by a 1933 one. Dwan was attractive (though no Fay Wray or Naomi Watts), but when we have her shower scene and see her bare hips, for the life of me I couldn't figure out why that was necessary. What's much worse, I couldn't believe the sheer stupidity of her line, You goddamn chauvinistic pig ape! You want to eat me? Go ahead! I guess it was the production quality that made her suicidal.The only reason why parts of the movie were enjoyable was because they were taken from the brilliant original. King Kong '76 itself brings nothing worthwhile to the table. And so, it wouldn't be until 2005 that we finally got the remake we deserved- and Kong could regain some of his dignity.

Recently, I finally saw this film from 1980.Altered States is significant for a number of reasons it was William Hurt's first movie; it was writer Paddy Chayefksy's last movie; and it was, arguably, Ken Russell's first attempt at fantasy. Of the three aspects, I was happy to see Hurt in his first role. Beyond that, the story and film are less than I expected from such a director.With more than a nod to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and Robert Louis Stevenson's Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, the story concerns a behavioral scientist and academic, Eddie (Hurt), who, while testing mind altering drugs, appears to regress for a while to an ancient, primitive, human-like state &#x96; not just mentally, but also physically. What's Eddie really looking for? True love.Along the way to that goal, he marries an associate, Emily (Blair Brown) who is unable to actually live with Eddie, being occupied with her own scientific endeavors in the animal world. What's Emily really looking for? Security with a husband.Mix that together with a lot of psychological mumbo-jumbo, deep water-immersion sequences, whiz-bang special visual effects bound to please some viewers, and much screaming between scientists at times, this viewer was left, at the end, with a singular response so what? Others, no doubt, will find deeper interpretations.In sum, this film is one for die-hard Russell fans. It's well produced and acted, for sure, but it's just plain silly, like many fantasies. I'm now trying to decide which is worse Billion Dollar Brain or this. Let me put it this way, I guess I don't recommend BDB at all.But I give this one only five out of ten.

Everyone else, listen up this one's underrated. Sure's it's a ball of fluff, but a very enjoyable one with no pretensions.

But it's worth the suffering (you can search for the eclair recipe later, folks).The first thing that tempted me to watch this film is that it features a few actors whose work I love, Patricia Clarkson being at the top of the list. I was prepared not to like Sarah Michelle Gellar in this, considering how many duds and screamers she's been in, but she was marvelously understated here, as was Sean Patrick Flannery, whom I generally like but who's been known to ham it up too much in other flicks. Not here he's bewildered through the first half of the film after he eats Amanda's food for the first time, which is totally understandable if you love food and quite charming, actually, considering what a heel he is when the film opens. He's such a GUY throughout, especially when he gets scared after their cooking scene together! Very accurate there. And still, food and love can conquer all if he gives them a chance (no, I won't tell you -- you'll have to watch).

Although not as good as the first three films,Lethal Weapon 4 is an Action to watch if you liked the first three Lethal Weapon's.Lethal Weapon 4 finds Riggs(Mel Gibson) and Murtaugh(Danny Glover)having to deal with Chinese criminals including a deadly criminal named Wah Sing Ku(Jet Li)who are smuggling Chinese slaves into the United States and have to stop them. With the help of new partner Lee Butters(Chris Rock)Riggs and Murtaugh have to deal with the Chinese criminals as well as Riggs becoming a parent,Murtaugh becoming a Grandfather and getting old and the gang is all back for more laughs and thrills.Lethal Weapon 4 is a Action-packed and funny conclusion to the Lethal Weapon franchise and every main character is back. Every franchise or film series comes full circle and the Lethal Weapon series is no exception and the Lethal Weapon series goes out with a bang with this film. Now,Lethal Weapon 4 since it's release has divided fans with some loving the film and some hating the film,I fall right into the former category because I liked this film and the other Lethal Weapon films for what they arethrilling,Action filled,funny movies. Right from the explosive opening Lethal Weapon 4 is a film filled with Action and great laughs taking what worked in the first three films and adding it to this film. LW4 is funny and is probably the lightest of the films in terms of Comedy and Humor with the characters Riggs,Murtaugh,Leo and Butters and the moments and dialog between the characters is hilarious and memorable. While LW4 is an Action-Comedy the film at it's heart is about getting old and change especially with Riggs and Murtaugh because Riggs and Murtaugh have been through a lot of things throughout the series getting into crazy adventures and even though the two have survived and had success Riggs and Murtaugh realize that they are not getting any younger and success won't come as fast. The change comes when Riggs realizes he's going to be Father with Lorna Cole(Rene Russo)and Murtaugh being a GrandFather of Rianne's(Traci Wolfe)and realize they can't be cops and take risks forever. Each sequel introduces new characters throughout the series. In LW2 it was Leo Getz,in LW3 it was Lorna Cole and in this film it is Lee Butters and Wah Sing Ku. Lee Butters is a character who works with Riggs and Murtaugh and brings laughs and one liners and is the opposite of Riggs and Murtaugh and is the new generation of cop. The character will divide viewers some will like him and find him funny while others will feel that Butters doesn't belong in the film but I like the character for his laughs and loudmouth energy. The villain Wah Sing Ku is pure evil and is physically the most challenging bad guy Riggs and Murtaugh have ever have to face because Wah Sing Ku is so quick and can take your head in one second without hesitation and he doesn't have to say much words because he is that menacing. Every time Wah Sing Ku shows up a there is tension all around and you will feel like something is going to happen when Wah Sing Ku is around. LW4 like the other films moves at a wonderful pace and never slows down until the end. The Action and fight scenes are great and each Action scene is raised to a higher level each time and there is suspense and nice build up to each Action scene. The ending of the film is excellent because it is filled wonderful Action,Laughs and heart and will have viewers smiling at the end and it is a great cap off to this excellent series.The cast does amazing jobs in their roles. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover do excellent jobs one last time as Riggs and Murtaugh once again having great chemistry. Joe Pesci is hilarious once again as Leo Getz and has great scenes with Gibson,Glover and Rock. Rene Russo is fantastic as Lorna Cole and has good scenes with Gibson. Chris Rock is great and funny as Riggs and Murtaugh's new partner Detective Lee Butters. Jet Li is menacing and believable as Wah Sing Ku,one of the villains of the film. Kim Chan is wonderful as Benny Uncle Benny Chan,a Chinese crime boss. Steve Kahan(Capt. Ed Murphy), Mary Ellen Trainor(Dr. Stephanien Woods),Darlene Love(Trish Murtaugh),Traci Wolfe(Rianne Murtaugh),Damon Hines(Nick Murtaugh),Ebonie Smith(Carrie Murtaugh)and Eddy Ko(Hong)give good performances as well.The direction by Richard Donner is excellent,with Donner always moving the camera and giving the film a great pace and energy especially with the Action scenes. Great direction,Donner.The score by Eric Clapton,Michael Kamen and David Sandborn is great and intense and matches the tone of this film. Another great score from Clapton,Kamen and Sandborn. There are also songs by War(Why Can't We Be Friends)and Eric Clapton(Pligrim). Wonderful songs.In final word,if you love Action films and the Lethal Weapon franchise you will love Lethal Weapon 4,an Action-packed,hilarious conclusion to a great series that is well worth your time.

The tension is held throughout as the characters slowly go insane. Clever use is made of the limited production value. The whole film is shot on one set, the cube room.

You can learn basic historical facts from them. This isn't an achievement to be taken lightly, not in a country in which 28% of voters believe Saddam Hussein was behind the 9\/11 attacks, or in which a substantial number of students think Watergate took place before 1900.I don't mean that the Warners' biopics were academic studies. Far from it. As here, we generally see a hero (or heroine) perform some socially disapproved of act and then being redeemed. He usually dies at the end, either with a peaceful smile on his face, his work on earth now being complete, or with a pen or a pistol in his hand, full of fight. Zola gets the pen treatment.Emile Zola, author of any number of infrequently read French novels (Nana may be his best known), was a famous figure at the time of this story, the end of the 19th century, when he decided to take up the cause of Alfred Dreyfus, an innocent army officer who had been convicted of treason, partly because he was Jewish.Zola and his big mouth intervene after Dreyfus is sent to a living death on Devil's Island. Zola writes an inflammatory newspaper article -- J'Accuse, which the movie helpfully translates as I Accuse -- and provokes a suit for libel. The French Army is mostly a proud and cohesive group and although the evidence against Dreyfus was rigged, nobody wants to admit it. Do Zola's strenuous efforts pay off at the end? If they didn't, Warners wouldn't have made this movie.The formula usually remained the same, with some variations. (Sometimes the resolute hero alienates a former friend, and so forth.) Paul Muni starred in more than one of them. He overacts, but that's part of getting the MESSAGE across. When he gives a rousing speech at the trial, he huffs and puffs, he waves his hands, his chin snaps up and down like a traveling block on an oil rig, and when he's not shouting, he's hissing his lines.The truth is on the march -- and nothing will stop it!, he says confidently. I don't think Emile Zola ever said any such thing.

In one moment, it vanished. But if this has been anything but a nightmare, and if we don't wake up to find ourselves safe in our beds, it could come again. To the ships at sea who can hear my voice, look across the water, into the darkness. Look for the fog.This is not John Carpenter's best film in any sense (Halloween (1978) and The Thing (1982) taking the cake on that title), but The Fog (1980) is a still a creepy, atmospheric, supernatural horror film that holds up to this day. Carpenter does once again what he was able to do with Halloween take a film with a rather small budget (though The Fog had a larger budget than Halloween, it was still rather cheap) and give it the appearance of costing a lot more than it did. While the film made 22 million dollars (which is good considering its budget of 1 million), it is not as impressive as the 47 million Halloween made. Still, I believe The Fog to be a wonderful film for what it sets out to be a small, atmospheric film, relying more on the tone of the film than any impressive special effects. This is why Carpenter is my favorite horror director. Sure, his plots are never life changing, and besides The Thing, his films are never filled with spectacular effects, but he manages to create wonderfully atmospheric films and has proved to be the best when it comes to slowly building tension.And this film is no exception. From the opening scene on the beach to the final shot, this film kept me on the edge of my seat, although I believe the film really takes off when Father Malone reads from the journal he finds. We never clearly see the creatures in the fog, which I believe adds to their threat. Their glowing eyes, hooks, and large, threatening bodies help their mystery. The fog they enter through in, though its glow is incredibly unrealistic and fake-looking, it is still quite eerie and allows for a lot of tension. Overall, the character development and plot is missing in this film, but it's still creepy, atmospheric, and a personal favorite.

But if this has been anything but a nightmare, and if we don't wake up to find ourselves safe in our beds, it could come again. To the ships at sea who can hear my voice, look across the water, into the darkness. Look for the fog.This is not John Carpenter's best film in any sense (Halloween (1978) and The Thing (1982) taking the cake on that title), but The Fog (1980) is a still a creepy, atmospheric, supernatural horror film that holds up to this day. Carpenter does once again what he was able to do with Halloween take a film with a rather small budget (though The Fog had a larger budget than Halloween, it was still rather cheap) and give it the appearance of costing a lot more than it did. While the film made 22 million dollars (which is good considering its budget of 1 million), it is not as impressive as the 47 million Halloween made. Still, I believe The Fog to be a wonderful film for what it sets out to be a small, atmospheric film, relying more on the tone of the film than any impressive special effects. This is why Carpenter is my favorite horror director. Sure, his plots are never life changing, and besides The Thing, his films are never filled with spectacular effects, but he manages to create wonderfully atmospheric films and has proved to be the best when it comes to slowly building tension.And this film is no exception. From the opening scene on the beach to the final shot, this film kept me on the edge of my seat, although I believe the film really takes off when Father Malone reads from the journal he finds. We never clearly see the creatures in the fog, which I believe adds to their threat. Their glowing eyes, hooks, and large, threatening bodies help their mystery. The fog they enter through in, though its glow is incredibly unrealistic and fake-looking, it is still quite eerie and allows for a lot of tension. Overall, the character development and plot is missing in this film, but it's still creepy, atmospheric, and a personal favorite. If you forgive its mistakes, you will be in for a nice, fun, creepy film. ","genre":"Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"1 June 2013","score":"","review":" I don't know what happened to Antonio Bay tonight.

This film set in the Second World War (1939-1945) in Tuscany, tells the story of Count László Almásy (Ralph Fiennes), who after an accident with his plane in the desert has the face completely disfigured, is put under the care of Hana ( Juliette Binoche) Canadian nurse who lost her fiancé in the war. Once taken care of, Hana discovers that the Count hides the secrets that are written in a book called The Memoirs of Herodotus (to which the count is very close), once started reading Hana begins to take an interest in the mysteries of the patient, and discovers that the Count had a great love affair with the British Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). Very sad and moving drama that tells a passionate love story, the film is a mixture of many things the Nazis bad, war, survival, desert adventure, eroticism, exoticism, the 'figurative art and landscapes visually very beautiful. The movie also has many advantages among which is the assembly the assembly of this film is very special because it has a very slow pace is in the movies that deal with love stories this is crucial, because this arrangement allows the viewer to live the love story in all its beauty, but also in all its bitterness. Another advantage is undoubtedly the interpretation of the actors Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas are very good, then there's the soundtrack that matches perfectly to the situation and to finish the script, which is very interesting and engaging and above all very simplified compared to the novel. But as in all the movies there are defects, one of which is the setting, as I said the sets are visually very beautiful but their reconstruction makes them seem fake. This movie I recommend it to all those who adore love stories very dramatic, but if you love the action and like Tarantino this film does not recommend it, you'll get bored to death. From my point of view this film is not a masterpiece but it is definitely a good movie so I give him a 7 because although I'm not a lover of love stories I still managed to like it. Awarded with 9 Academy Awards 1997 Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actress, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Editing, Best Sound, Best Costume Design, Best Soundtrack.

It has the coolest clothes, cars, actors and a terrific storyline. This is Martin Scorsese's masterpiece. Featuring a terrific set of performances from Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro and of course Joe Pesci this movie is one of the all-time classics.Based on a true story the storyline of the movie takes place between the years 1955 and 1980 we follow the storyline of Henry Hill(Ray Liotta) a small time crook that finds himself being wound up in the mafia. The story also focuses on his relationship with Jimmy Conway(Robert De Niro, the psychotic Tommy Devito( Joe Pesci)and his relationship with his wife Karen ( Lorraine Branco.There is so many good things about this movie and it's hard to talk about everything in one review. I think the acting and writing particularly stand out. Liotta does a fantastic job as you're never sure if you want to like the guy or hate his guts. He's the perfect antihero and Liotta performs this perfectly. De Niro is fantastic as Hill's mentor but the icing on the cake is Joe PesciI ( who picked up the film's only Oscar). Playing the ultimate psychopath he's one of the most unpredictable characters ever in film. You never know what he's going to do and Pesci plays this perfectly.The rest of the cast is also excellent. Lorraine Branco is very good as the wife of Henry Hill ( the only normal person in the entire movie. Paul Sorvino is also great as one of the capos. There's also a few famous faces before they became famous e.g. Samuel L Jackson as well as about two dozen people from the Sopranos such as Michael Imperoli, Tony Sirico and Frank Vincent.The directing and camera-work is superb from Scorsese and the writing is excellent with many quotable lines. Overall Goodfellas is a masterpiece of cinema and should be remembered as one of the all time greats of cinema. It was fantastic 23 years ago and it is still fantastic now.
