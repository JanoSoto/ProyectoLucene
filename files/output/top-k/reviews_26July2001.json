Joe Johnston wrecked a perfectly good series. It was not thrilling, exciting, or entertaining. They should have waited for Speilberg to get the time to direct it because he would have done an outstanding job. Although he did executive produce it, but he couldn't get the time off from directing Artificial Intellagence, and executive produce Evolution and Shrek. You can't blame him though for trying. But you sure can blame Johnston for everything that happened wrong. Which was all ninety minutes of the film. I heard somewhere that William H. Macy didn't even like his role and he just did it for the money. Well good thing Jeff Goldblum didn't bother with this mess. (Well just think of all the messes he has gone through his life. This wouldn't be any surprise if he had done it.) And another thing is that the graphics are not very good in this one. And there is two new dinosaurs in this one. One of them is bigger than the tyranasaures and you don't get to find out his name. Plus all he is is a tyranasaures with a fin on the back. And you only see him in one scene which stinks and you don't even see the tyranasaures in the film. Plus the scene with tyranasaurus with a fim only lasts for about a minute and that is all for him. The second dinasaor to jump in this junk is the tarydactol. Now he has a longer scene than the tyranasaures with the fin. And it is also a better scene. They have to cross this bridge and on the other side the tarydactol comes and takes the boy to the nest and the bid goes back and forth getting people. Well they soon get out of that mess minus one person. Anyways you know when the movies over when they play that music and there on a plane ride home. Just like the first one. Remember in the first one Allan looks out his window and there is a bird. Well in this one there is a group of tarydactols flying by. Anyways I give this movie a four out of ten. Not for the stupidity but for the graphics which weren't much. So this is a pretty good mark. And the graphics are even better in the second film. Well if you want to see a really bad movie to top off the night. This hunk of junk fits perfectly.

Burton and his crew pretty much deserves the credit for that. This movie's plot is riddled with cliches from a General who was outcasted getting revenge only to die to an old Ape guy dying RIGHT AFTER telling Thade (Roth) what WE need to know.  It's as if the writers were afraid their slightly unique version was too unique and was becoming unrecognizable.SPOILER WARNINGI thought some of the ideas in the movie were intriguing and scary.  Not so much the idea that apes COULD become the leaders of a planet due to time travel and evolution from experimental monkeys, but that they DID.

Brandon Teena is played excellently by Hilary Swank in a dynamite, Oscar-winning performance. The film chronicles Brandon's fun-loving, carefree, and self-destructive adventures through rural Nebraska as he tries to find the right girl. One day, he meets some new friends who whisk him off to the small, uncharted town of Falls City, Nebraska, where Brandon meets the lovely Lana (Chloe Sevigny) who was Oscar-nominated for her brilliant performance. Once Brandon is settled in, and has wooed Lana, the films becomes the most charming fairy tale come true love story. Things inevitably take a plunging turn for our young hero when problems with his gender rises. This film goes from sweet, to shocking, to an ultimately horrifyng climax. Based on true events, this film graphically depicts the events that brought the struggle of one boy's quest for love into a voyage of Hell. Peter Sarsgaard also gives a great performance as one of the friends.Director and co-writer Kimberly Peirce has made a masterpiece with her intimate portrait of American white trash and a truly moving story and blends into a riveting, intense, and thought-provoking movie experience. I strongly recommend this film to all who seek not just good entertainment, but a wonderful chance to see beautiful performances and a sad, but altogether beautiful film that has the courage to go where no film has gone before. This is a truly original love story that has some of the same sacrificial elements of Rome & Juliet. This film is NOT recommended for the close-minded, homophobic, or weak-hearted. This film is strong, but graceful. Sad, but brilliant. Hilary Swank's acting alone make this film worth watching. As an actress, Swank truly made wonders for herself is the breakthrough role that has to be seen to be believed.

Redundant exploitation of hackneyed plot conventions, namely, the 1) psychopathic criminal, 2) last job, and 3) ultimate heist.A few seductive overhead shots, neatly composed and symmetric enough to be in a TV ad, accompanied by an off-beat monologue start the film. So far so good. Then there's the quirky humor of a boulder flying down the hill. Still good. But then nothing, fluff, blather, this, that, and the other thing, just the usual neo-hip emptiness for the neo-hip (jump edits, plot ellipses, minimalist characters, yaddi yadda, vide Run Lola Run). When will they ever stop using oral activity--eating, smoking, and drinking--as a substitute for real carnality, real sensuality, real action?At first I resisted even going to see this.

Then there is Enemy At The Gates. It could be all too easy to dismiss Enemy At The Gates as being an attempt to cash in on Saving Private Ryan's success, but in my opinion, it is a very worthy competitor. I'm sure the Russians who fought in the battle of Stalingrad would feel that at least someone painted a realistic portrait of the hell on Earth that they endured. Of course, the film comes of as being somewhat fantastic, and it came as a surprise to me to learn that                                           Sergeant Vassili Zaitsev was actually a real person (whose sniper rifle is still an exhibit in a Russian museum), but this makes it very entertaining to watch.A lot of historians have it that the battle of Stalingrad was the most unpleasant one fought during the second World War, and this film's set design and cinematography capture that impeccably. When the Russians are battling the Nazis, you get the idea that if the Nazis didn't kill them, malnutrition, tetanus, scurvy, bubonic plague, or a million other things would. Jude Law and Joseph Fiennes lend authenticity to their roles that makes it even easier to follow them on their personal journey through hell, and Ed Harris is scarily convincing as a high-ranking Nazi. The real surprise here, however, is Rachel Weisz as Sergeant Tania Chernova, and the very heart and soul of the film. When she describes the reasons why she decided to take up a gun and battle the Germans, it all makes so much sense that you just want to buy the poor girl a beer and give her a good warm embrace. Not that such things would erase the scars that her character bears, but one would feel obligated to try.Writer\/Director Jean-Jacques Annaud, writer Alain Goddard, and cinematographer Robert Fraisse treat the subject matter with great care towards authenticity and entertainment value. It's very tricky to get these two things in proper sync, but they more than manage here. They also don't rely on any hokey photographic effects to tell the story, simply letting you see everything as clearly as possible, letting your imagination do the rest. Anyone who's read anything credible about the inhuman suffering the Russian soldiers endured during this battle will have no trouble filling in the gaps that the narrative leaves about their living conditions. The blood and gore shown during the battles is also very conducive to the atmosphere. Rather than just expecting you to believe that a solider gets his stomach spread all over half a kilometer of pavement by enemy bullets, they show you so you can get a feel for how bloodthirsty both sides in the confrontation were. Even the sex scene doesn't look out of place here.To make a long story short, this is the first film I've seen in a long, long time that I haven't been able to come up with a list of criticisms for. It is simply excellent, and the 7.1 rating it is currently stuck with does not do it justice. It is easily superior to the likes of Platoon, the equal of more esoteric war films such as Three Kings, and even the equal of Saving Private Ryan. Vassili Zaitsev would be very happy that his struggle has inspired such a commendable piece of art - it is exactly the sort of thing he and millions of others like him (on both sides of the German Reich) were fighting for.

Some guy must have said, Yeah, have some kid lost on an island populated by dinosaurs, and have a group of people look for him, oh yeah, we can get that guy...what's his name...Sam Neill that did the first film.  He can go with them.  Essentially, that is the crux of Jurassic Park III. Hovering just around ninety minutes, the film has so little to offer in original storytelling.  I mean, you know with a film like this you are going to get certain cliches, scenes, etc..., but this story was just so empty from the start.  The script, which was also the biggest flaw with Jurassic Park  The Lost World, is, to use a cliche, weak as water.  The script for the first film was very good.  It explained the scientific possibilities of dinosaurs living in a modern world, etc...  It had more than one plot strand going on at one time.  The second sequel, and this one, shamelessly try to push one story to its limits...and each story has very definite limits.  What's wrong with making the film a little more complicated in terms of plot.  Audiences are not as stupid as to not be able to follow more than one line of thought and action.  How bout having a film that DOESN'T have a child protagonist.  There's a thought! So much could be done with the technology and scope of these projects if they were just utilized in a more sophisticated story.  Yeah, okay I know people expect people to be killed(not much of that in Jurassic Park III by the way), but how about showing something other than killer instincts of dinosaurs.  Wow!  That would be a concept!  Well, enough of my sermonizing about the film industry treating audiences like ninth graders without minds.  There are some good things about Jurassic Park III.   Hmmm...let's see...yes, Sam Neill does a pretty good job again(the rest of the cast sucks...sorry for my frankness!).  Tea Leoni and Bill Macy are excrutiatingly bad as the parents of the kid who can survive eight weeks alone, untrained on the island when experts are killed off in seconds after landing!  Laura Dern has a brief cameo with little to do really except look real nice in a very tight pair of jeans.  The talents of Michael Jeter are wasted in his thankless role.  The special effects are good, and at least in this film, a wide variety of dinosaurs are shown(not just the T-Rex and the raptors).  In fact, the best part of the film is the encounter with the Pterodactyls.  They are impressive.  The film is not real bad, nor real boring...just very, very, very disappointing.  For me this is much weaker than the second sequel The Lost World.

The film also contains the most amount of nudity, and arguably the rudest jokes of the franchise. The title quote is Connery's quip to a girl with ever-changing wigs, while later we get the immortal I'm afraid you've caught me with more than my hands up.There's the sense of the odd, or uneasy, about this one all the way through. From the theme title (and what a great song!) precipitated by a cat's cry to the homosexual henchmen Mr.Wynt and Mr. Kidd. Their unnerving air is not the result of their gay, slightly homophobic, portrayal, but in Putter Smith's performance as Kidd. Not a trained actor, but an accomplished jazz bassist, this off-kilter playing creates an unconscious, unsettling atmosphere.It's this juxtaposition which compels throughout. Like seeing Britain's top espionage agent doing the childhood snogging with yourself routine then smashing a man's head through a window just seconds later. It's a superficially lightweight film, but with a nasty, almost bitter undercurrent. Connery's obvious resistance to the role actually serves it well here, given that this is the first post-wife Bond movie. Bernard Lee plays an unusually terse M to complement this abrasive 007. Such a starch display cuts through the smug underpinnings of the character and makes the cheesy one-liners more palatable. He looks older than in any of his other Bond films - Never Say Never Again included &#150; but this also fits his anguished, bereaved state. In line with this most misogynistic of Bond pictures, Jill St. John's character development passes from intelligent, through to devious and down into simpering bimbo.Incidental music is a bit disattached, and often feels like it belongs to another film.
