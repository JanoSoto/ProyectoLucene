So I wouldn't call this a chick flick.  I don't really believe a chick flick genre exists, but for those guys who do--don't worry, you have nothing to worry about.  Plus, it's directed by Ridley Scott, so there's action elements scattered here and there.  There's a big truck explosion towards the end, since you can't have a Ridley Scott film without any explosions.  It's just against Ridley's nature.  The story involves a studly but abusive man at a bar getting shot after attempting to rape Geena Davis and a greasy, perverted truck driver getting his truck blown up, but I still didn't feel the female screenwriter was heavy-handed in delivering her message about females being treated inferior to males in society, and her fantasy about females empowering themselves and overcoming the oppression that men put them through.  Because you really feel a connection to these characters--whether you're a man or woman--and you want to cheer for them every step of the way.  The cast is first-rate.  Susan Sarandon is superb as always, and so is Geena Davis--and man, is she HOTTT!!  My man Harvey Keitel is cool as the hard-nosed Arkansas detective.  Michael Madsen is also a really cool actor, and he's great as well, though he couldn't grasp a Southern accent.  I'll let that slide.  Chris McDonald delivers a delightfully farcical performance as Davis's aggressive but bumbling husband.  He delivers most of the laughs in the film.  I just felt the movie could've been trimmed about thirty minutes.  Plus, it's mainly dialogue-driven and it does tend to drag at points.  Nevertheless it's funny, exciting, touching and one wild ride!  And it has a good message--not just about the roles of females in society but also about the power of friendship.  Unfortunately, I knew the ending before watching this movie today for the first time.  It has one of those landmark endings that everyone talks about--I'm just not going to mention it here because it would be considered a spoiler.  But I was still very entertained.

no. worse off, is he shot? no! ok, so somehow he manages to hang onto the bottom of the train, get back up, appear back inside one of the train cars, and is now talking to the black guy person... and this is where the worste part comes in. the black guy (who is DEFINATELY the token black guy in the movie) mentions to seagal that he just saw him get shot, seagal points to where the bullet hit him, and actually says you see this? no bullet went in this... and for the entire rest of the movie, they just completely ignore the fact that he was shot... i suppose you just have to accept the fact that he's... umm... bulletproof? yeah, that's it......... oh oh, there's another really bad scene that nobody else has mentioned. ok, so the train is going along the side of a big cliff... somehow seagal manages to find himself hanging off the side of this cliff. well of course that happens, every action star has to have a scene where he's hanging by his finger tips off the sid of a cliff.. duh... but ok, so they stop the train and send guys out to get him. one of the guy magically has rock climbing propelling equimpent, hooks up a rope, and propells himself over the side of the cliff down towards seagal. seagal again is hanging entirely by his finger tips, and appears to be struggling not to fall. however, whenever this nice guy with the rope comes down to kill him, suddenly seagal apparently is able to defy gravity. he takes one of his hands off the cliff, turns entirely around (somehow) and starts to talk to the guy... picture it... he's hanging there, facing away from the cliff, hanging on by only the finger tips of one hand... and it doesnt even look like he's hanging on with that hand. he just looks like he's standing there, leaning up against a wall or something... but last time i checked, it's pretty hard to stand on AIR. anyways, using that one mighty hand of his, he pushes up off the cliff and lunges towards the guy on the rope... when's the last time you had the strength in one arm (that you're using to barely hang on to the side of a cliff, mind you) to just launch yourself 10 feet towards a guy on a rope?

i'm making a bomb... and with that, he takes a scoop of what appears to be either crisco, ice cream or something of that sort and some ice cubes, and mixes it all up in one of those bar tender drink mixer things... he straps his beeper onto the side (which somehow works as a timer? maybe?) and declares it now a bomb. well, it explodes alright, so i guess he was right. anyway, now he casually walks into the main room where all the bad guys are, throws it in, and it explodes... now mind you, all of the fancy equipment that the bad guys were using to try and blow up things was in that room... and he just threw a bomb in there... now despite the fact that all of the equipment assumably just got blown up (and you actually see it on fire), it is in perfect condition later on, and working perfectly fine... hmm, maybe they had a few more lying around in storage just in case.... of course there is the really bad scene that was already mentioned where he runs faster than a 200mph train crash... but that's beside the point... of course there are all of the other things about this movie that just p*** me off... like how his little Apple palm-pilot dohicky has to wait 30 seconds before it can redial... why?

no. worse off, is he shot? no! ok, so somehow he manages to hang onto the bottom of the train, get back up, appear back inside one of the train cars, and is now talking to the black guy person... and this is where the worste part comes in. the black guy (who is DEFINATELY the token black guy in the movie) mentions to seagal that he just saw him get shot, seagal points to where the bullet hit him, and actually says you see this? no bullet went in this... and for the entire rest of the movie, they just completely ignore the fact that he was shot... i suppose you just have to accept the fact that he's... umm... bulletproof? yeah, that's it......... oh oh, there's another really bad scene that nobody else has mentioned. ok, so the train is going along the side of a big cliff... somehow seagal manages to find himself hanging off the side of this cliff. well of course that happens, every action star has to have a scene where he's hanging by his finger tips off the sid of a cliff.. duh... but ok, so they stop the train and send guys out to get him. one of the guy magically has rock climbing propelling equimpent, hooks up a rope, and propells himself over the side of the cliff down towards seagal. seagal again is hanging entirely by his finger tips, and appears to be struggling not to fall. however, whenever this nice guy with the rope comes down to kill him, suddenly seagal apparently is able to defy gravity. he takes one of his hands off the cliff, turns entirely around (somehow) and starts to talk to the guy... picture it... he's hanging there, facing away from the cliff, hanging on by only the finger tips of one hand... and it doesnt even look like he's hanging on with that hand. he just looks like he's standing there, leaning up against a wall or something... but last time i checked, it's pretty hard to stand on AIR. anyways, using that one mighty hand of his, he pushes up off the cliff and lunges towards the guy on the rope... when's the last time you had the strength in one arm (that you're using to barely hang on to the side of a cliff, mind you) to just launch yourself 10 feet towards a guy on a rope? oh yeah, i forgot. you're not an action hero... ok ok ok, i know i said i'd only rant about one at the beginning and i've already mentioned two, but there is a third i just have to mention. which one? the whole making-a-bomb scene. at one point he walks into one of the train cars, which for some reason is stocked with food items (it's NOT the kitchen), and starts fiddling around with stuff. since there is no logical explination for what he's doing, he decides to explain it himself. he turns to the camera and says oh, so you want to know what i'm doing? i'm making a bomb... and with that, he takes a scoop of what appears to be either crisco, ice cream or something of that sort and some ice cubes, and mixes it all up in one of those bar tender drink mixer things... he straps his beeper onto the side (which somehow works as a timer? maybe?) and declares it now a bomb. well, it explodes alright, so i guess he was right. anyway, now he casually walks into the main room where all the bad guys are, throws it in, and it explodes... now mind you, all of the fancy equipment that the bad guys were using to try and blow up things was in that room... and he just threw a bomb in there... now despite the fact that all of the equipment assumably just got blown up (and you actually see it on fire), it is in perfect condition later on, and working perfectly fine... hmm, maybe they had a few more lying around in storage just in case.... of course there is the really bad scene that was already mentioned where he runs faster than a 200mph train crash... but that's beside the point... of course there are all of the other things about this movie that just p*** me off... like how his little Apple palm-pilot dohicky has to wait 30 seconds before it can redial... why?

But when the first movie of The Lord of the Rings trilogy came out, things were about to change. The Fellowship of the Rings came out whopping The Godfather out of first place with a 9.7 rating. Godfather's rating 9.0. For quite a few weeks FOTR remained as the most highly rated movie of all time. But when I looked up again one day, it was at No.2 with a 9.1. Godfather with a 9.0. Anyway, I'm one of the first to say this, but I'm dissapointed that it's not No.1. It may not be the best movie of all time, but it does deserve to be no.1 a lot longer than it was on at no.1. But I have to say I'm actually debating whether it's my favorite movie of all time because when I came out of that theatre the first time, I kept saying to myself, that movie is the grace of cinema. I mean who ever is says that this is a bad movie, what are you smoking? I can't think of one bad thing to say about this movie. I mean I would hate to admit this, but Tom Bombadil was a waste of three chapters and there was no reason why they should of had him in the movie. I mean he was just pointless. But let's get to the good stuff. Half the stuff in the background was cinematography not computer generation. Elijah Wood was mistakenly called Elijah when he was born. His real name should be well, Frodo Baggins. Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee was also fantastic. Every actor and actress did very well. As for the movie itself it was great at very aspect, acting, plot, action, drama, happiness. The movie had it all. The action I have to say to is that it was much more suspenceful than the book. It was very well done especially the last battle sequence. The best acors as i say again were Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Ian Mckellan, and Viggo Mortenson. But as for the whole movie, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. FOTR deserves a 10\/10. And I'm really looking forward to the two sequels especially Return of the King, which right now is my personal favorite book. If FOTR is not nominated, I will lose all my respect for the academy. P.S One of the best sword Mano e Mano's I ever seen in a movie at the end which is done by the leading orc and Strider (Aragorn) You wiill not be dissapointed with thus movie!!!!!!!!!

I mean who ever is says that this is a bad movie, what are you smoking? I can't think of one bad thing to say about this movie. I mean I would hate to admit this, but Tom Bombadil was a waste of three chapters and there was no reason why they should of had him in the movie. I mean he was just pointless. But let's get to the good stuff. Half the stuff in the background was cinematography not computer generation. Elijah Wood was mistakenly called Elijah when he was born. His real name should be well, Frodo Baggins. Sean Astin as Samwise Gamgee was also fantastic. Every actor and actress did very well. As for the movie itself it was great at very aspect, acting, plot, action, drama, happiness. The movie had it all. The action I have to say to is that it was much more suspenceful than the book. It was very well done especially the last battle sequence. The best acors as i say again were Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Ian Mckellan, and Viggo Mortenson. But as for the whole movie, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. FOTR deserves a 10\/10. And I'm really looking forward to the two sequels especially Return of the King, which right now is my personal favorite book. If FOTR is not nominated, I will lose all my respect for the academy. P.S One of the best sword Mano e Mano's I ever seen in a movie at the end which is done by the leading orc and Strider (Aragorn) You wiill not be dissapointed with thus movie!!!!!!!!!

A few months later I found out that they have a top 250 list for the best movies of all time rated by the public. When I looked at the list, I saw The Godfather at No.1 which has always been highly praised. I always now check out the top 250 daily to see if that has changed. Results It hasn't. But when the first movie of The Lord of the Rings trilogy came out, things were about to change. The Fellowship of the Rings came out whopping The Godfather out of first place with a 9.7 rating. Godfather's rating 9.0. For quite a few weeks FOTR remained as the most highly rated movie of all time. But when I looked up again one day, it was at No.2 with a 9.1. Godfather with a 9.0.

I can't even offer it as a hand-me-down to a deserving child as this film is a racist pamphlet that would probably get me in trouble with his or her well-meaning parents or the local schoolboard. There are so many wrong-headed aspects to this film, I don't know where to start. First of all, being myself, if not French, at least Québécois, French-speaking and Francophile, I found the character Molière, a geologist, a kind of absolute compendium of hate mongering, xenophobia and of the use of negative stereotypes to inflict humiliation on nations who do not happen to agree with US foreign policy at all times. The Nazis would have been really proud of this one. Molière (or `Mole', get it?, a pun that can only exist by mispronouncing `Molière', i.e. pronouncing it the ignorant American way &#150; moh-lière - instead of the proper French way &#150; mah-lière) was a French XVIIth century playwright whose name (an invented one, his real name being Jean-Baptiste Poquelin) has become synonymous with the French language. One says `the language of Molière' for French as one says `the language of Shakespeare' for English. So naming this virulent collection of vile racial stereotypes `Molière' is tantamount to insulting the entire French nation and its language. Molière is short, ugly, unkempt, unintelligible, lascivious, slobbering, voracious, hairy, selfish, boorish, stubborn, greedy, piggish and smelly. He has an aversion for soap. Molière became a geologist because he likes all things dirty, presumably (he is the only one who doesn't get to tell his story). Molière is a sub-human character, just the way Hitler pictured the Jews in pre-war propaganda films. His opinions are uninformed and inconsequential. He is an object of scorn, shame and ridicule and he is not to be trusted. I can't say I appreciated the bull-dykish, ex-school bully, street-smart, female Spanish-American mechanical engineer much either. What would have been really refreshing and original is to depict a female mechanic who does her job, against type, with a certain grace, charm and femininity. But then grace and originality are not on the agenda of this outing. As soon as the bookish hero joins this practical crew, all the characters who depend on him to make their fortune automatically resort to sarcasm, violence, bitching, dirty tricks, razzing, bullying and ostracism to keep him in his place. What is this? A co-ed episode of `Oz'?! Do they really hate him because he is intelligent and cultured? Am I reading this movie right? Are there really 86 minutes left of this tortured monograph of a turn-of-the-century criminal subculture?!

You will yourself call for a merciful end to all this long before the dénouement. The `heroine' was modeled after the type of bleached California beach volleyball slag that can so easily be mistaken for an overage hooker off the court. The `natives' are dumb, silent, lumbering, uninformed and inconsequential, basically cannon fodder for the visiting Americans.

The only problem with that is that he had street tires on it which would never grip the road well enough to transfer that amount of torque to lift the car like that. A smokey, mile long burnout would have been more true to life but then the race would have been no contest; he would have lost by a mile!   I could go on but I don't want to seem like I am being too critical. I have to admit that I was slightly entertained with the storyline. The movie is really geared (no pun intended) toward 14-18 year old males and I can understand that. Not every movie is made for me.

Not necessarily true.While watchable, I was left with an empty feeling when exiting the cinema.  I was hoping for so much more, but all I got was a below-average movie with a good ending.  An interesting idea, I feel Cruise snapped up the rights to 'Open Your Eyes' without thinking about how the film would come across in the mainstream.  Crowe tried his best, but I don't think enough was added to make the improvements the film needed.  While enjoying the last third (to a point - anyone who states it isn't taking huge liberties regarding Total Recall is kidding themselves) I was only just managing to keep my attention after the fairly drab bulk of the film.  Yes character building was a necessity in this story, but the love story alone was not enough for me to warrant 90 minutes + of my viewing.  A new angle or sub-plot needed to be implemented.Sadly I wasn't even kept thinking throughout.  I knew very little about the film beforehand but I could predict it like a particularly badly written episode of Neighbours from fairly early on in the picture.  Once again disappointing.  6\/10    ","genre":"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"},{"date":"5 February 2002","score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  Every scale has a bottom.

First, it's an affectedly wierd retreatment of a common movie theme that has been handled in both funnier (the original VICE VERSA) and more touching (18 AGAIN with George Burns) ways.

He was so likeable and naturally&#133; funny. When asked if being funny was a skill or a gift, he replied that he didn't know how you could teach somebody to be funny. Before that, I had seen him in There's Something About Mary and Meet The Parents. At that time, I was more interested in watching Cameron Diaz or Robert De Niro's performances.In his previous movies, Ben Stiller would portray a nice but unlucky guy, so incredibly unlucky that it was unnerving. With Zoolander, he remains a nice guy, but instead of being incredibly unlucky, he becomes a victim. He is no longer the hero - lacking super human powers though - who has to face adverse circumstances to achieve his goal (conquer the woman that he loves, or her family for that matter). In Zoolander, he is a kind of anti-hero who had no goal whatsoever (apart from having absolute FUN &#150; even at the cost of human lives), until his fame shakes and he becomes a target of a dreadful manipulation...I'd say, if you are NOT a fan of Ben Stiller; or if you are a fan of the Ben Stiller of his previous movies; or if you expect the comedy genre to be witty and high-brow, stay home and wait until it's available on video to rent Zoolander. You'll have a good time if you keep your mind open and want to relax one evening.Derek Zoolander has only the look for him, and a big heart &#150; but other than that, he is VERY stupid. In fact, he is a caricature, meaning that his character is based on real life traits. But those real traits are found in various persons. For the purpose of the caricature, they are mixed together in one character and distorted with great exaggeration. As a result, people are fooled they think that someone like Derek Zoolander cannot be found out there in the real world, nor either of the other characters in the movie.I especially liked the opening scene in the warehouse, where they plan to kill the Malaysian Prime Minister and state the reasons why he is a threat to the industry. I also liked the shots for Derek Zoolander's first appearance, through the journalist Matilda Jeffries. There is a suspense that was nicely built up what is he going to look like?! Another of my favorite scenes was the brainwashing scene, where he is made to believe that the children themselves claim for their rights to be able to work in the factories. And I found the new historical perspective on Lincoln and Kennedy assassinations very funny.Because the whole thing is a true FARCE &#150; nobody feels threatened, very rare are the people who will gain a new insight, a fresh outlook on what our everyday world is made of, how we contribute to model it by the choices or non-choices that we make. So all is well, we are safe and we still have fun!I found the theme of the movie very enticing the modeling\/fashion industry, and featuring a male model in a ridiculous manner is a great idea. The directing by Ben Stiller was good. There was a good pace and the movie moved along smoothly. The only thing I missed was more `insights' on the modeling industry, such as the flashback Derek Zoolander had on pretending to be a monkey during a photo shoot. The David Bowie cameo appearance was very nicely done.Some people didn't like the fact that Zoolander appeared as a kind of `family movie', with Ben Stiller's Dad (Jerry Stiller as Maury Ballstein) and his wife (Christine Taylor as Matilda Jeffries) play supporting roles. Jerry Stiller was perfect for the role and great in this movie. Christine Taylor was OK, but to me, she failed to inspire a special feeling for this female journalist (good girl\/bad girl?). Maybe the script was at fault, but as a talented actress, she should have been able to carve an unforgettable character for Matilda Jeffries. Think about Milla Jovovich's performance as Katinka.

As a former cop turned dealer in one of the sleazier L.A. subcultures, he does strike me as being too sensitive. Seeing him throw up after watching (I should say experiencing) a murder, you might think he came across this kind of stuff along the line of duty.

Juliette Lewis tries to compensate for her lousy performance with frontal nudity in almost every shot she's in. I think Basset and Sizemore make the most out of this good but not-so-good-executed story, although Basset tends to overact. If visuals are your thing, than by all means, give this movie a try.
