It gives the viewer a surreal image of life in Baltimore (I live in nearby Washington, DC), with a Warhol-like use of color, exaggerated motions and emotions. Pecker becomes larger than his town can handle, and he is separated from his loved-ones (including a sexy Ricci) by his man-loving art manager. The picture left a refreshing taste in my mouth--kind of like a fresh strawberry ice cream on a hot summer day--and though this taste was rather flat and simplistic, it only made the whole thing more profound and critical. It is a celebration of life, liberty, and the right to bear arms...and everything else this country stands for. -Juan Pieczanski (jpieczanski@sidwell.edu) ","genre":null},{"date":"8 October 1998","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  John Water's (Pink Flamingos...)

It was this film that inspired American bad-boy director John Carpenter to show America just how cool a movie fried up Szechuan style really is.Kurt Russel's John Wayne-squared performance as the prototypical gwailo, lost in a culture beyond his understanding but too cool to care, is a perfect foil.  Through Jack's eyes we are introduced to the fascinating and deadly world of flashy wuxia gongfu, magic, demons, and the smattering of superstition and China's popular religions of Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism that is the hallmark of the modern Martial Arts genre of films. Still, his character plays a part, adding the dynamic element of luck and chance needed to bring the events of the film to their explosive, 80-frames-a-second conclusion.While the cultural implications of the movie can be explored more deeply, the film is perhaps best seen as one who doesn't understand Chinese culture fully but can go with the flow like the best of them.  Unfairly passed over, this film was ahead of its time.  Only now does America seem ready for the boat from Hong Kong to pull into the harbor.  People call this movie cheesy and over the top without understanding that Carpenter did this because he wanted to show what a Hong Kong movie was like, while making it uniquely American, and to show how a culture can flourish and run deep without being noticed by the world around it.Watch it once because you like Kurt Russel and think gongfu and Chinese magic and mythology are cool.  Watch it again to begin to understand what it means to truly be a gwailo.

Along with Fast Times at Ridgemont High(1982), Ferris Bueller's Day Off(1986), and John Hughes' other teen-comedy The Breakfast Club(1985), Sixteen Candles is the most endearing comedy of that decade. Molly Ringwald was our favorite teen sensation and Anthony Michael Hall proved to fit well as the love-crazed Freshman. It's a very fun movie that characterizes teen life perfectly from the family dinner to the dance scene to the parents-are-away-time-to-party scene. It's a good twist, instead of guy chases girl, the younger sophmore yearns for the senior who is already endowed with a blonde bombshell. He finds a certain keen interest in her after he learns that she likes him(as guys tend to do) and fate starts to pull things together. John Hughes wrote this movie with an all too real teen touch and the warm-heartedness that made audiences applaud it for so many years.
