I may be in the minority, but I simply don't understand the hype all about these movies!!! Perhaps the most overrated trilogy ever. I really do believe so much of this hype & attention should be given to some other much BETTER films, like Iron Will, which was a true story. Or the Great Escape, another true story! Maybe it's just evident how much of a FETISH Hollywood has for violence, blood, gore, sexual innuendos, and bad language! That's NO ART, you can trust me! I'm not much of a fan of Al Pacino, nor any of the work he has done - he just always seems to come off as scary & abusive (with his scary eyes & unpredictable attitudes.) Couldn't Al Pacino take up a KINDER character role here and there sometime soon???The film was a mess, and so was it's sequels! Everything is shot in the dark, most scenes are often times really boring, and half the time you can't understand what the characters are saying 'cause they're speaking in *freaking* Italian!! And don't forget the horrendous false cult of Catholicism especially being depicted on-screen; Catholics are DUPED. They worship idols, believe in a false Jesus, and are only all just about idolatry, bigotry, and superstition. Though to be fair, I did like seeing Robert De Niro here and there, and I liked some of the talk concerning Israel & the Jewish people - because I have quite a soft spot for Jews, because they have literally got a long sad history of persecution, and deserve to be recognised for their incredible genius minds and intelligence.But in the end, that really doesn't matter in a huge porous abomination nonsensical pile of worthless nothing that is this movie!

Where I would consider the movie to be underrated is that it just never seems to come up in discussions of people's favorite Hitch films and, personally, I would consider it to be one of his best.I brief aside for the complete Hitch noob. There was a time a decade ago when I really only knew him for his two horror films (PSYCHO and THE BIRDS) before I really started delving into his catalog of genius movies. One thing that might strike you is that there is often a familiar feel to Hitch movies, like you've seen this before. That is generally because his movies have been ripped off and homaged so much that you probably have seen the plot redone in different ways on TV shows and other movies, that shouldn't detract from how good the original product is, though.This movie is taken from a play and feels very stagey throughout. Aside from a few shots, the movie takes place almost entirely in one apartment and, mostly, in one room. Few directors could have pulled this off successfully, but Hitchcock is not your average director, is he? It never feels claustrophobic or repetitive. He creates so much creative divergence in his shots that you almost don't notice that you've never left the room during the movie until you reflect back afterwards. Speaking of those shots, there are a lot of very interesting angles here, most of which were employed to make use of the 3D technology, but it forces Hitch to shoot things you don't typically see in movies, with a whole lot of low angles.Naturally, placing your movie in one room puts a lot of weight on the plot and acting and both come through admirably. The plot is typically twisty as is any of Hitch's work. The idea of a man planning the perfect murder and the way that plan slowly unravels on him is done so well. There is a lot of complication of detail in both the setup of the murder and in the final ah-hah moment from the police detective as the truth comes out. All of this could have been very confusing, but is executing very well so as the viewer is never left feeling like a detail is missing.The acting is superb. Ray Milland, as the husband plotting to murder his cheating wife, is excellent. Sort of a poor man's Cary Grant, he is so suave and assured in this movie. Even in the final moments as things are crashing in on him, he never loses his cool. He plays the part so well that we are confused in our feelings towards him. We should be rooting against him for trying to murder the beautiful Grace Kelly, but he's such a likable character that you find yourself hoping he gets away with this, in the end. The police chief is another great character who reminds me a lot of Columbo in that way of playing the role of a bumbler who's clearly much more clever than he's letting on. Grace Kelly isn't given too much to do here, but is certainly nice to look at and plays her limited role well. She's another complicated character as, again, we should detest her for cheating on her husband, but we never want to see real harm come to her.When you've seen the requisite Hitch movies that everyone is supposed to see like VERTIGO and N BY NW and you're looking for another excellent movie, look no further than this murder mystery.

John Carpenter's Halloween is a piece of masterful art. It defined horror and slasher films. It defined and revolutionized low budget movie making. It is the patriarch to an entire genre and it is a film I love deeply. It literally kick started my love for the horror genre and it is THEE bar for which everything else is judged. What makes this film so brilliant? Outside of the fact that it is truly terrifying and gets under your skin...when you break down and analyze the film you will literally be floored by it. If you have not seen this movie, you need to sit down, pop some popcorn, turn out all your lights and watch what is easily one of the great films of its genre if not in film history. You have to put the movie into perspective too. John Carpenter was a nobody (if I'm not mistaken?) Jamie Lee Curtis was plucked at random because she was not a star, the film was made on a shoestring budget and yet every single piece falls into place. The haunting setting of Halloween and the small Illinois town that is a snapshot of Americana, the back story of the mysterious murderous young boy and his escape, the obsessed doctor in a Victor Von Frankenstein type role chasing down the monster he spent years trying to keep locked up. The dialogue works so well and even when its being cheesy, it works for those characters. Then you have John Carpenter's masterful brilliant direction. This film has at least three of my all time favourite movie scenes. I won't say what they are but they give me chills when I see them.I have always enjoyed Jamie Lee Curtis as an actress, I think she's amazing and a legend in her own right but this is where it all began. She is absolute perfect as the virginal and innocent Laurie Strode. We have no real background on her character yet but as the ultimate (seemingly random) victim of an insane killer she defines scream queen. When I hear that term...I think of her. And she's not without fortitude. She is tough as nails while being absolutely terrified. She fights to the death when put in a survive or be killed situation. Donald Pleasance is already a legend but he adds such instant class and gravitas to the film as Dr. Loomis. He has two or three speeches that are stirring and literally tell the entire story whether setting up the scene or making you feel like you understand Michael Myers. Honestly, everyone else is sort of fodder for Myers. However, they each have very important roles to play and they do their roles well. They leave you with a lasting impression and the film wouldn't be the same without them period! Nancy Kyes, P.J. Soles and John Michael Graham (gets one of the great horror scenes ever...one of those aforementioned scenes that give me chills), all play the wild and crazy friends of Laurie's that are systematically picked off. Charles Cyphers has a small but very good role as Kyes' father and the local sheriff. His best scenes are opposite Pleasance. Kyle Richards and Brian Andrews are really terrific as the two little kids who are under Laurie's care when Myers attacks. They deliver their lines a little stiffly but for being who they are, they are great!! Nick Castle inadvertently I think creates one of the most powerful and formidable horror villains in history. His stoic and terrifyingly powerful portrayal of Michael Myers must be seen to be believed. Yes he is somewhat comparable to Jason Voorhees (or the other way around) but there is an implied intelligence, brute strength and most importantly unstoppable and unexplainable desire to kill in his simple performance. That mask will forever haunt me.For whatever reason John Carpenter had this innate talent inside him to take a simple concept and what little money he had and make it a mountain. He made the most effective horror film to date using lighting and characters and back story. There are things hidden in this film (or maybe its total coincidence) but every time I watch it I wonder what it means in the bigger picture. To make a simple slasher picture and give it depth and meaning and make you think about it is an impressive feat and he will always be a horror god to me. The rest of the series ranged from terrible to almost as good as this one but that doesn't change the fact that how it all started is a reason to watch horror.

I won't say what they are but they give me chills when I see them.I have always enjoyed Jamie Lee Curtis as an actress, I think she's amazing and a legend in her own right but this is where it all began. She is absolute perfect as the virginal and innocent Laurie Strode. We have no real background on her character yet but as the ultimate (seemingly random) victim of an insane killer she defines scream queen. When I hear that term...I think of her. And she's not without fortitude. She is tough as nails while being absolutely terrified. She fights to the death when put in a survive or be killed situation. Donald Pleasance is already a legend but he adds such instant class and gravitas to the film as Dr. Loomis. He has two or three speeches that are stirring and literally tell the entire story whether setting up the scene or making you feel like you understand Michael Myers. Honestly, everyone else is sort of fodder for Myers. However, they each have very important roles to play and they do their roles well. They leave you with a lasting impression and the film wouldn't be the same without them period! Nancy Kyes, P.J. Soles and John Michael Graham (gets one of the great horror scenes ever...one of those aforementioned scenes that give me chills), all play the wild and crazy friends of Laurie's that are systematically picked off. Charles Cyphers has a small but very good role as Kyes' father and the local sheriff. His best scenes are opposite Pleasance. Kyle Richards and Brian Andrews are really terrific as the two little kids who are under Laurie's care when Myers attacks. They deliver their lines a little stiffly but for being who they are, they are great!! Nick Castle inadvertently I think creates one of the most powerful and formidable horror villains in history. His stoic and terrifyingly powerful portrayal of Michael Myers must be seen to be believed. Yes he is somewhat comparable to Jason Voorhees (or the other way around) but there is an implied intelligence, brute strength and most importantly unstoppable and unexplainable desire to kill in his simple performance. That mask will forever haunt me.For whatever reason John Carpenter had this innate talent inside him to take a simple concept and what little money he had and make it a mountain. He made the most effective horror film to date using lighting and characters and back story. There are things hidden in this film (or maybe its total coincidence) but every time I watch it I wonder what it means in the bigger picture. To make a simple slasher picture and give it depth and meaning and make you think about it is an impressive feat and he will always be a horror god to me. The rest of the series ranged from terrible to almost as good as this one but that doesn't change the fact that how it all started is a reason to watch horror. It seems like all the right pieces fell into place for this classic and I will continue to watch it at least once every year to remind myself what amazing horror is truly about. 10\/10 ","genre":"Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"11 November 2014","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" While it's not the first film in the Evil Dead franchise to recommend to a non-seasoned viewer, The Evil Dead has pride of place for being the first of the films, as well as for being so visceral and intense.Five young people journey to a mountain cabin near the Tennessee border for a weekend getaway, only to accidentally awaken malevolent spirits of the dead by flicking the play switch on a recorded recitation of ancient Sumerian burial rituals and funerary incantations.

There's no groovy catch-phrase in this one, and the terms deadites or Necronomicon aren't mentioned. (The Book of the Dead here is called Naturon Demonto.)

But it is a good horror film, directed by Sam Raimi with real flair and engaging depth-of-field camera-work. After a slow opening 22 minutes, the film kicks into high gear and never lets up all the way to the end.The film proved a bit of a slow-grower. A sluggish box-office performer when released in 1981, it has since become a bigger deal culturally than Chariots Of Fire, the year's Oscar-winner for best film, as well as other big 1981 hits. Great, no, but it has a kind of greatness about it.Why are you torturing me like this? Ash cries out at one point.We're going to get you... the spirits answer, singing tauntingly.What makes the film work so well as I see it is not the acting, which is frill-free minimalist work to put it kindly, but rather the sense of location. The strange house, more a shack really, is a thing of wonder, with various rooms tricked out with odds and ends that suggest more than we see. There's a bit of a Snoopy's doghouse effect going on here, as the house interior seems way too spacious and crammed with accouterments to match the exterior we see. There's even an attic visible in some exterior shots which never comes into play in this movie.Why are the kids so insanely willing to stay in the house when things start to go so wrong? The car steering wheel suddenly acts on its own, the bridge they drive on to the house gives way as they pass over it, a pendulum clock stops in mid-swing, a woman's hand becomes possessed as she sketches, and a trap door bangs and flies open by itself. Perhaps it's some moonshine they drank that was lost in the editing, or some pot-smoking which was scripted but never filmed. The end result is you never really care about these dumb characters, who seem more like lab rats than people. Without the same level of humor that buoys Evil Dead 2 so brilliantly, you don't care as much as you should.But that's more a quibble than a fault. The positives outweigh the negatives, especially in terms of the brilliant sound design by Joe Masefield (which adds immeasurably to the spooky mood throughout). They are further enhanced on the DVD thanks to dueling commentaries by Campbell and by Raimi and producer Robert Tapert, who play up their different views of what went wrong and right with what apparently was a grueling production.The end result was worth the struggle.

Then by accident I discovered it was Lifeforce and directed by none other then Tobe Hooper (to my shock).Lifeforce is a movie based on a novel by Colin Wilson, that got screenplay treatment by Dan O'Bannon, fresh from his success of Alien (and heavily underrated Dead & Buried). Directed by Tobe Hooper, maker of legendary Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Lifeforce is a very different take then your usual Tobe, who often made low budget horror movies that usually had dirty and gritty tone (TCM, Eaten Alive), and some less glossy movies like The Funhouse, usually involving around serial killers at the time (excluding high budget supernatural Poltergeist)I found this movie interesting simply because of that. It's rather glossy, with wide range of special effects which fairly hold up even by today standards (some outdated of course, but still descent). Color pallet is switched to colorful instead of usual brownish\\gray in other Tobe Hooper's movies (like two mentioned above).Story itself? While it's a silly, and even absurd at times, movie still has lot of fun and heart in it, because while Tobe might have silly script, he was still trying to make a proper horror film. Not lot of suspense, but it's likable that movie tries to generate some sense of upcoming doom for it's character and citizen of England. Some nice looking and nightmarish visual imagery, especially toward the end.Don't think too much about it, just let yourself and enjoy. It's a silly fun and entertaining movie. It's kinda like something that was suppose to be made in '50s but instead ended up being made in '80s. At first I thought it had to be remake of some '50s forgotten classic, but nope, it wasn't.Acting ranges from good to bad (funny bad), depending on actors, but who can say no to naked Mathilda May in every scene she's in?

The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad is the sort of movie that I usually watch so that I can heckle it like Mike and the 'bots do to crummy flicks on Mystery Science Theater 3000. I ended up not heckling this one as much, but I analyzed it as much as possible. Mr. Toad comes across as the typical rich boy who has no impulse control. As for Ichabod, he just proves that slimeballs lurk everywhere. It should go without saying that the Headless Horseman is one freaky character.And then there's the narrators. Basil Rathbone I like, Bing Crosby I consider a perfidious individual due to his nearly cruel strictness with his family. In the end, it's an enjoyable movie.

Bosley Crowther in New York Times, soon after the premiere of William Wyler's gripping work, pointed out accurately that the film visions the overflowing humors and the curious pathos of such returns, and it honestly and sensitively images the terrible loneliness of the man who has been hurt. One of the major strengths of this film, therefore, does not lie in entertainment (though it does not lack it whatsoever) or any sort of heroic deeds worn in glorified patriotism (something that many movies of the time did not resist), but in the very empathy it employs to the theme and the characters. William Wyler speaks to the generation with clarity and modesty derived from his very experience with the men of Air Forces. Roger Ebert develops the thought labeling the central theme as sobering at the problems veterans faced. He adds that Wyler doesn't pump in superfluous drama but actually IS with his characters and with\/for his audiences. As a result, the story does not resort to the specific time of history but concludes in a rather universal, timeless insight into psychological and moral aspects of those troublesome torments and alienation therein endured. Ebert explains the fact why the movie so wonderfully passed a test of time with three adjectives applied to it lean, direct, honest. Let me highlight those features from the standpoint of the three veterans herein depicted.The main cast do not only come from various backgrounds, do not only portray different personalities with common experience yet diverse backgrounds but truly surprise us at multiple levels. All of them truly deservedly credit.FREDRIC MARCH, a very famous actor at the time, does a splendid job as sergeant Al Stephenson coming back home to his wife Milly (played with bravura and charm by Myrna Loy) and two kids, a daughter Peggy (played with subtlety by Teresa Wright) and a son Rob (Michael Hall). He is 'lean, direct and honest' in both merry-go-round scenes and serious moments but most captivating at the very adjustment to the family after the years of absence. The terrific ability to balance the hilarious with the serious is something that makes March's performance deserve particular attention. Although he has come back from war, much is at war within him...DANA ANDREWS as a former bombardier Fred Derry is a totally different character to analyze and perceive in the very context of pre-war vs. post-war reality - something many viewers of the time could identify with and most viewers of our time can fully understand. His destiny is shaped in direction towards Al's family (he is in love with Peggy) and yet, distorted by the haunting past and wrong choices. Here, who calls our attention is his wife Marie (Virginia Mayo), a conceited, vain woman occupied with what one looks like rather than bothering to consider what one feels. Andrews is given much freedom on the screen to develop the character on a great scale for the time. He does well. But the most intriguing and perhaps the most identifiable character among them is...HAROLD RUSSELL as Homer Parrish, a sailor most hurt by the war. His artificial hands, steel hooks have become almost a symbol of the movie's most powerful anti-war aspect, and, at the same time, the reason why the story may be called food for quiet and humanizing thought (Crowther). His character moves us most and leaves us almost reflective because it embodies honesty. Homer Parrish is a living statement that evokes the indifference and arrogance of war. He is in love with Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell) but he has to confront the reality the war experience has given to him. He is no longer the way he dreamed to be. Yet, the awareness of being loved helps him go on. Consider the bedroom scene with Wilma and the genuine tears of joy at having heard she loves him. Deservedly Mr Russell got the Oscar for the role and there is no question about one thing such a screen achievement may be considered one among the very best roles of one's life. In this character lies quiet, subtle, captivating heroism.Among the female characters, great performances are delivered by Myrna Loy as Al's wife whose acting Crowther labels as charmingly reticent and Teresa Wright as Peggy who highlights trustworthy enthusiasm and youthfullness in difficult times. Virginia Mayo's brassy and brutal (Crowther) depiction also bears watching.In all this achievement, kudos to cinematographer Gregg Toland who employs high contrast lighting with terrific visual resonance added to the the whole story and builds the scenes upon exceptional clarity.

Pearl Harbor is an awful movie, it's a waste of money, time, history, and talent. I had previously heard some really bad things concerning the director of this movie, Michael Bay, and while he is not completely to blame for the movie, he still deserves a lot of the blame. He, along with Jerry Bruckheimer and Randall Wallace seemed to know nothing about what had happened during the actual attack, the way that the attack is portrayed in this movie, it looked like a victory, when as everybody who knows about this attack knows, it was a defeat. There is almost nothing in this movie that corresponds to actual history, there are so many inaccuracies, that the movie should be retitled Pearl Harbor The Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer version. No kidding, it really should be, because they put no emphasis on the history and put all of the emphasis on the drama, visual effects, and the romance.In addition to the historical inaccuracies, there are also numerous scenes that had nothing to do with the plot. The opening scene for one thing, where these two boys climb into a plane and accidentally send it in flight. When I saw that, I just wanted to bang my head against the wall, when I was their age, I certainly knew better than to do something like that! But no, they had to learn it the hard way. The movie has a great cast, with people like Ben Affleck, Alec Baldwin, Kate Beckinsale, Jon Voight, and many more. And all of their talent is wasted, all of it. Ben Affleck plays a character who seems to be something like the next incarnation of Superman, during the attack on Pearl Harbor, he is seen going around rescuing people like no tomorrow. If fact, I was half expecting him to raise the Arizona out of the water and save all of the sailors who died on there. This is an insult to those who died on the Arizona, and to all of those who died in the attack as a whole.Michael Bay directs a script written by Randall Wallace, and like I mentioned, Wallace's script is terrible. In real life, you don't go from training in the air force one day to shooting down experienced German aircrafts the next day, sorry, it's just not going to happen. Also, President Roosevelt did not receive news of the attack from an aide or adviser running into the room, he was having lunch when he received a phone call telling him about the attack. And also, correct me if I'm wrong on this, but, President Roosevelt could not stand up by himself. There is a scene in a cabinet meeting where he rises from his chair. In real life, he had polio and had to be assisted when standing up. There are many more historical inaccuracies with this movie, but if I named all of them, I'd probably give away the hole movie. Pearl Harbor is an overlong, terrible, and very inaccurate telling of one of the most interesting events in United States history. This movie had potential, but the producers simply went to waste with it.All in all, this is one of the worst movies of 2001, and it's a shame that they had to waste such an interesting historical period with a horrible film. While director Michael Bay isn't completely to blame, he isn't completely blameless either, he also shares the blame with producer Jerry Bruckheimer and screenwriter Randall Wallace. Bruckheimer must have decided something along the lines of I'm going to make a movie about Pearl Harbor, but I'm going to do it the way that I envision it. And as a result, with get this movie that buys into the drama and the romance instead of the facts. So basically, if you want to see an effective World War II film, or an effective movie about attack on Pearl Harbor, then this movie is definitely not it.

By the way, if you by some chance to decide to give this movie a go, then you had better be prepared to see something terrible.1\/10 ","genre":"Action, Drama, History"},{"date":"11 November 2014","score":"","review":" Ever since I watched this film when I was younger with my father it has always stuck with me and remained on my favorites list, that has to mean something.

The Star Wars (aka A New Hope) id the best of the series for it's great humor, intense action, and great characters, my favorite was always Darth Vader. I would recommend the unaltered version of this film which is available on amazon. I say that because the original unaltered version gets the story through best without the cgi Jabba walking with Harrison Ford which is just plain embarrassing to see. The action is great mainly dealing with ships and lasers, but there is one awesome and epic light-saber fight which is kinda short but worth every minute to witness the first ever battle. The character were a blast like the cocky Han, the young and brave Luke, and the Mighty Chewbacca, again I highly recommend this space classic ","genre":null},{"date":"11 November 2014","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Like many movie franchises, they all have a beginning.

I didn't find a single reason to love it.It's long, boring and ends in a pathetic way. Those who say the ship- wrecking scene is great in terms of visuals need to watch 2001 A Space Odyssey which has much better visuals than this movie and was made in 1968 (its a sci-fi about space).This is a complete waste of time. It's way too long. It's so boring. It's a bad love story. There are no great visuals as people say. The fanboys are worst. Cameron is a great director but sorry this movie sucks. I wasted my 3 hours on this piece of garbage.

This film sees Edward Norton's character who is just an average person who meets Tyler Durden who is a completely crazy person and they start Fight Club which turns about to be much more. Edward Norton is great in the role as he truly conveys the idea that he is like us and a situation like his could end up to anybody like him and it helps make the character relatable. Then there is Brad Pitt's performance as Tyler Durden which is awesome as he is what every person wishes they were carefree and awesome, this is probably Pitt's wackiest performance and he is fantastic. Helena Bonham Carter plays the love interest and she does a really good job and her chemistry with Norton was really good also the guy who plays Norton's boss does a good job as he is the guy we are meant to dislike as he is the one who is holding back Norton's life. But I wish some other characters were more fleshed out and had provided more which is really the only reason it doesn't get a 10. The story is quite controversial but I love it because it focuses on social themes and situations that most directors wouldn't even bother looking at, also there is a twist in the film and it is a great twist that totally changes the film. The script is great with the dialogue between Pitt and Norton being great and some very memorable dialogue that is great. The style is quite violent but it is supposed to be as the story has fighting in it and it is also great because of the social implications. Overall it is a superb film that is fantastic and definitely worth a watch.
