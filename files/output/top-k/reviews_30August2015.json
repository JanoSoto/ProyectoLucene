The two men end up back on an island where all sorts of strange creatures are. These creatures, it turns out, are the work of Dr. Moreau (Marlon Brando) who is trying to creature the perfect mix of human and animal.When I originally saw this film in 1996 I was shocked at how bad it was and I couldn't help but wonder how it turned out so bad. Then we got a brilliant documentary by David Gregory, which explains what happened during the production so I decided to re-visit the movie and I was surprised to see that time has actually been rather kind to the picture. There's no question that it's still a complete mess, which is no wonder considering what happened during the production but at the same time there's quite a bit of good things to be had here.For starters, the special effects are actually wonderful and this is especially true for the make-up effects. The animal people's make-up is terrific and you actually feel as if you're looking at a real mix between humans and animals. Of course, these effects are a major step up from the stuff we had seen in earlier version. Another major plus is that the story manages to do a good job in the creatures problems with who they are. There are many scenes where they want to know if they're human or some sort of animal and I found these scenes to be rather intelligent.The performances are also something that took a beating when the film was originally released but outside of Kilmer phoning in his performance, what we get here is actually pretty good. Thewlis makes for a good leading man and Fairuza Balk is good in her role of the panther woman. The various actors who appear as the creatures do a very good job at well and especially how hard it is to act with all that make-up on. Then, there's Marlon Brando. I hated his performance the first time I saw it but I must admit that it worked for me on this viewing. I thought he did a rather good job playing the father to these and I actually liked the way he tried to parent these creatures.Of course, that doesn't cover some of the really bad stuff here including the entire sequence with the ice bucket on his head. Other decisions the actor made like the white make-up was also incredibly silly and just doesn't fit in the film. Another problem with the movie is the entire relationship between Douglas and the panther woman just doesn't work. There's also obvious issues with the production that shines through including a rather action-packed and silly ending. I'd also argue that it just seems like the original film wanted to be something more intelligent but that was scraped.THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU still isn't a good movie but at the same time it's certainly not as bad as it was viewed in 1996. I'm one of the people who really crushed this film when it was released but this latest viewing had me seeing it a tad bit better. Still, you can't help but call this a disappointment since the materials were there for something much better.

How other individuals interact with each other, how well a piece of operating equipment works or how technology advances itself forward are just a couple of examples. In the current world of today where computers are basically apart of everyone's lives, it's not that difficult for someone to find information on another person. All anyone has to do is go to any search engine whether it be Google, Yahoo, Bing, Ask etc. and they'll at least get 2 to 3 webpages about or are connected to them in some way. It's the scary truth, being on the internet is not always the safest place to be. Looking back on Enemy of the State (1998) it seems that director Tony Scott and writer David Marconi have produced a piece of cinema that is an underrated gem that feels more significant now than it ever was the year it was released.The story is about an attorney\/family man Robert Dean (Will Smith) being unknowingly jammed into a big government conspiracy about a rouge senator Thomas Reynolds (Jon Voight) wanting to pass a bill that'll begin invading the privacy of the US residents. What Dean has that he doesn't know about is a videotape that a suspect hid in his bag that had visual evidence that Reynolds is behind the killing of congressman Hammersley (Jason Robards) who supported individual privacy. The idea of homeland security has always been a controversial topic since the concept was ever brought to fruition and using that as an undercurrent for the script's plot was a thought provoking move on Marconi's part. As stated before with technology being a much bigger proprietor for internet access, the ability to be researched is a lot easier than it was displayed in this movie. Dean ends up being hacked from all directions - his house & mobile phone, home and satellite. Now there's that, the internet, social media and a slew of other devices that make it easy to track someone.Another part about the writing that is effective is how many times Marconi will keep the audience guessing. Every time there's a point where progress occurs, Marconi writes in an event that creates a new roadblock and a new solution plan has to be made. It's clever because most scripts are cut and dry with either one or (maybe) two remedies to a problem. This at least has three or four and its uncommon, which is good because it keeps the viewers guessing. The only component to the writing that doesn't make sense is how a supporting character was able to figure out where the FBI was located. Isn't the FBI supposed to be covert in their operations? It's a little weird that their main office doesn't seem to feel so secret. Other than that, almost every step of execution to this story is woven in such a way that'll have the viewer on the edge of their seat.The acting is well done too. Will Smith as Robert Dean plays his character differently compared to other past roles. Throughout the majority of the running time Smith plays his character like an average family man; humble, respectful, caring and not cocky. Occasionally a small bit of the old-school Will Smith humor arises from the cracks but for the situation he's put into, sarcasm sometimes feels like it was needed. Tagging along side later on is Gene Hackman as Edward Lyle, an ex-NSA agent who knows the inner workings of the system and provides some frightening insight to how things run inside the government. With Hackman being a lot older, he plays it up as a grumpy man when he's hungry and although he's not the nicest sounding, he does care at certain instances. Behind these two are a ton of other cast members consisting of Jason Lee, Scott Caan, Jake Busey, Stuart Wilson, Regina King, Lisa Bonet, Gabriel Byrne, Jack Black, Jamie Kennedy, Larry King, Tom Sizemore and even Seth Green.The cinematography provided by Daniel Mindel had a interesting look to it as well. Since this film involves surveillance of various individuals, the camera will have numerous angles to sit at. That means being hidden cameras in various objects, or among the buildings and street property. Then there's also the satellite tracking cameras that usually fly straight down to the location that's being focused on and then watching what's going on from a bird's eye view. Now obviously, the flying down from space to earth is CGI but after that it looks very real. Mindel later worked on other big budget films like Mission Impossible III (2006), Star Trek (2009), its sequel and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014). The music composed by Trevor Rabin and Harry Gregson-Williams appropriately has the right mix of synthetic and organic sounding orchestra. There are also two main themes, one for the film and another for Hackman's character. They are not that memorable but they do show up more than once and that's good. The action cues aren't as well developed but they do elevate the experience.Besides one plot hole being a bit too noticeable, the rest of the film is fine.

However, is it the worst? Here it goes Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt goes on a mission to Sydney, Australia alongside with his IMF team as they go after a deadly virus to be destroy. Also, keeping a lookout on a thief, who happens to be in a relationship with our main villain Sean Ambrose. That doesn't sound much like a plot, don't you think? I guess that's all up to you. The plot I will admit isn't as interesting as the plot from the first one as that one was trying to be more of a mystery movie. This one, however, its just pretty much a simplistic plot with plenty of action. I don't mind plots being simple, but it would've been something if it has a plot that is actually more interesting. Aside the plot for being weak, the plane from the opening scene of the movie is purely CG, and it really doesn't look good at all; at least the bird went through a fire (also CG that appears toward the end) doesn't look as bad as the plane. Thandie Newton does an OK job for her performance, but her character isn't as compelling as any other female leads that I've seen in movies. So those were the issues, but is there anything good? Yes, there is. I thought Tom Cruise does a great job for reprising his role, and really is good for doing his own stunts.

He does a fantastic job on the action scenes, and also knowing where to point the camera at.

Hans Zimmer's music is very different than Danny Elfman's, but I love his arrangement on the theme song and how he provides his own take of the music for the movie. When I hear the guitar riffs, I just go flat out crazy because it makes you want to rock out. I love the look of Australia as it was being filmed. Also, never I find this to be boring. Sure the plot is weak, but I can just put this movie in and enjoy it for its mindless entertainment. All in all, its a John Woo movie and he has own unique style on making this movie.

As time goes by, I wasn't sure if this movie would still hold up after looking up everyone's thoughts on the movie, especially the Jim Phelps twist that everyone hates. So I watched it, and I really don't think it was that bad. So the premise of the film is about Ethan Hunt, our main hero, who goes undercover to find out who has framed not only himself, but his team that were killed during their mission. While figuring it out, he also recruits some new team members while teaming up with Jim Phelps' wife Claire as they try to retrieve the IMF NOC list. So, basically, it plays out like a mystery movie as Ethan Hunt has to figure on who did this and why; its not really much of an action movie but I think the movie works on its own level as it plays very low key or a bit in your own opinion of the movie. Also, I have read that some of the original cast members of the original show and die hard fans were very upset that they made Jim Phelps the bad guy. I don't know if its actually a big deal, or what were they expecting for the movie as it first came out but I do know is that I have never watched the show nor have any knowledge to it whatsoever. Furthermore, I wasn't as upset as what the live action Scooby Doo movie did when they made Scrappy Doo the bad guy. So I guess you can say that I'm okay with Jim Phelps for being the bad guy, and I thought Jon Voight's performance was really good. The rest of the cast all did fine on their own, and I do say that Tom Cruise who is really good and also being awesome at the same time. I thought the direction that Brian De Palma did was incredibly well done. I really do admire the premise of the movie, and I do find it very Hitchcockian as it keeps you interest to know what is going on. The movie does have some very good suspenseful parts like the scene where Ethan Hunt is being hung on cables as they try to retrieve the list. I love Danny Elfman's music of the movie, and his arrangements of the Mission Impossible theme. The final scene of the movie was alright because I kind of which if the helicopter wasn't CG so that it wouldn't had to be in a tunnel. There were parts that are real, while other parts were not. I guess they were trying to be safe, because it is understandable that using helicopters in movies can be dangerous but it is for what it is. The movie does have some good stunt work, but its Tom Cruise who is actually doing it all by himself. Some of the actors, were just replace with doubles as like what I just said about the final scene is just playing safe. When I look back at the sequels, I'm sure they do better than what this movie as when they are parts that took risks, while others not. I still respect this movie for being low key, but that is just my opinion. So, yeah, I actually still love Mission Impossible and I don't think it was as bad as some of the negativity that I've read.

The first was 'The Pianist,' a fine if not extraordinary Holocaust picture that I feel gets a bit more love than it deserves, though it does get far better in the second half. The second movie was this one. It concerns a mute girl whose only voice is her piano, as well as her daughter, played to Oscar gold by a young Anna Paquin.Of these movies, The Pianist gave me about what I expected. If I hadn't seen Schindler's List first, I think I would have liked this movie better. But it is a fine picture that I will say is better than the movie that did win Best Picture, Chicago (though LOTRTT is better than them both). This movie, on the other hand, gave me what I didn't expect. I don't know what I expected, but an artful, stirringly-shot film with characters that you get invested in that is also quite erotic is not it.Especially the erotic part. It is done well and I liked it alright but it did surprise me. Part of that is because I live in America, a country with no problem showing mass amounts of violence but that hates showing natural sexuality. I could describe this in detail but I see no reason to do so when so many people have done so already.What I will do is take a bit of time to completely destroy the argument that sex and violence in movies can be gratuitous. Bear with me. As a writer, I know that gratuitous means unneeded or unnecessary. But think about that for a second. By that definition, do you know what else is gratuitous? Vacations. Fancy food. And fiction itself. Sex and violence are no more gratuitous than good characters and writing. If you don't like ample portions of sex and violence in fiction, fine. But don't call it gratuitous. Because it's not. Instead, we should judge whether or not it adds something to the tone and desires of the film. More likely than not, it does.Certainly, it does in this movie. I'll try not to spend too long talking about this because there is a lot else that I want to get to. But sex is not glamorized here. There is simply carnal passion between the characters. But it is not simple at all. It addresses it complexly, which it is. All and all, it rings true.And it is as these points above all else that it is clear that this film was directed by a female, one of too few major films that is. I'm not saying that she does a better or worse job at these scenes because of her sex, but it is definitely different. And educational for me. As a male, I do not automatically see things from a woman's perspective. This opened my eyes somewhat, as many good movies tend to do.If you watch these scenes of passion, you see that warm colors dominate. Saturated reds and oranges take center stage, as opposed to the outside scenes, which are shot with cold colors. Those being saturated blues and greens. I am always a fan of this sort of chromatic differentiation when it is done well, a major reason why I love Soderbergh's Traffic. Also notice that whether the colors run hot or cold, they always run distant, a choice that I do believe helps with the cold, intermediary, almost purgatorial feel that the film is going for. It the second best thing about this movie.The best being Anna Paquin's performance. Though only a ten year old girl at the time, Paquin pulls off the best performance of her career and the best performance of the film in general. As well as the most important. Her innocence and naivete adds a certain light to a movie that can at times get dark.There were times when I was about to fade off into the dark blues of the cinematography, but Anna brought be right back. And that's not to say she's only an ingenue. She comes off as a legitimately driven, hopeful, real young girl. To the film's credit, they don't even make her Superman-perfect like they do for so many kid characters. She is the main reason her mute mother, played well by Helen Hunt in an Oscar-winning performance, suffers a catastrophic physical setback that I won't go into for sake of spoilers but that is quite traumatic. This is one of the best performances by a child actor ever. That actor is deserved.Not that the other performances are bad. Other than Helen Hunt, Harvey Keitel is also spectacular. Sam Neill, otherwise known as 'that guy from Jurassic Park', is okay but is the worst performance in the film. That guy just doesn't have any charisma.And I will not forget to mention the soundtrack, one of the best I've ever heard. It's like an Avengers soundtrack, made up of some of the best pieces in history, particularly the theme, which I listen to every time I want to get immersed into life.Just like the piano brings out the heart and soul of our mute main, this movie brings out our heart and soul.

Yes Mission Impossible is back for a second round and features ridiculous stunts, a kind of storyline more suited to James Bond in the 60's and Tom Cruise going absolutely crazy with the fighting. I didn't like this film and although far from hating it, the movie didn't give me much reason to like it at all, with silly things added in here and there as well, well let's go over it shall we.First off you have the stunts, done well and the only thing I will fully remember from this movie but also that this has long droughts without any action and then suddenly has too much. Tom Cruise comes back in the same style he has in the first instalment boasting some over the top fight sequences and also longer hair. The story is for me in certain scenes a little too convoluted, now the entire story as a whole isn't but parts are, they defy logic at certain times and some moments are not well explained and really try too hard to draw you in to a plot I just couldn't invest in.Now what to say about good old John Woo, well to put it in simple terms I really did not enjoy his directing. His style is so insane it just makes normal scenes turn into a crazed stand off and then don't even get me started on the pacing. I can't really say he directs the actors well either and although the cast are fine and all that, his direction can make some scenes just a little dumb and yet again confusing and repetitive. Robert Towne is a legend of screen writing but my word does it look like he has lost it here, I'm not saying this is a career ruin for him not by a long shot but Towne could have done so much better and written something memorable, not just some generic stuff. Staying behind the camera well on the camera maybe is the cinematography which is done well, I liked the nice sweeping shots and angles which change the scene completely, wasn't too sure on the close ups of the face but in general some good stuff. I think if you're going to make a spy film at least put the action in and spread it out, here it is all concentrated in the same place and so it becomes boring after a while, even with the insane stunts. I think we should have seen more of the suspense that at times the first movie brought to the table, too often in this Cruise or should I say Ethan Hunt just does things at a fast pace with no thrill to it. A better villain as well for me would have been better, sure Dougray Scott and his henchmen could be bad but that true terror I did not see, a poor casting choice all round and should have been easier to absolutely hate. This film isn't all bad I admit it has it's moments of genius actually and although I think Cruise is not great in this or the first Mission Impossible, I can't deny he has a lot of spy style. If you liked the first movie then you should have no problems liking this one too, the stunts and the action are enough I felt to satisfy MI fans. For anyone else please be directed to take your brain out before viewing this, it is popcorn movie stuff and I don't think the plot is smart. So overall I do feel this is poor and not really an addition I think Cruise deserves to have in his film catalogue, he is not good here, not bad but not good and I think spy films do not gain anything extra from having this among their ranks.

It's an unconventionally drawn horror, and the directing debut of Bill Paxton, who also stars. He plays a loving single father in the 60's, to two young sons, Adam (Jeremy Sumpter), and Fenton (Matt O Leary). The story is told by the adult version of Fenton (Matthew Mconaughey) to a skeptical FBI agent (Powers Boothe). When they were still very young, their father went through a disturbing change one day, he comes home and tells them that he has been visited by an Angel, who tells him that he has been chosen to kill demons, who have taken human shape, and only he can see. The Angels gave him special weapons to kill the, too.... An axe and a lead pipe. Younger Adam is too mentally undeveloped to understand that his dad isn't playing with a full deck anymore and goes along with the plan, but Fenton realizes something is off and refuses to take part, resulting in his father shunning him. There some scenes where Paxton carries out his delusional crusade right in front of his sons that will give nightmares, but Paxton doesn't compromise, directing with a steady, unflinching eye that captures the unspeakable horror in vivid strokes. He solidly plays the dad too, completely deluded and nuts, but still the caring, loving father, gently trying to make Fenton and Adam understand his quest in some chilling exchanges of dialogue that make you wince to the bone. Sumpter and O Leary are thrown into impossibly tough scenes for kids their age, but handle them perfectly. Mconaughey is a laconic wonder in the present day scenes, with some dark, burning secrets, and delivers the tale in a way where we're sure as hell paying attention. Boothe is a low key growler as Doyle the agent who patiently listens, and may have a few secrets of his own. Now, there's a huge third act twist, that some say is a huge cop out and sucks away all of the dark energy and nightmarish atmosphere that came before it. I don't think it's that damaging the film. It's certainly a revelation, and while does drastically change characters motivations and the central mystery itself, add to the labyrinthine nature of the plot, and certainly makes you think.

Sure, they aren't DeNiro\/Scorcese or Dicaprio\/Scorcese in terms of the Oscar caliber performances, but they have been or I should say were a prolific couple in terms of making purely enjoyable action flicks. And there's perhaps no one better at action than The Terminator himself Arnold Schwarzenegger. True Lies is at its surface a pretty goofy action comedy, but there's more depth to it than at first glance. Arnold is at the top of his game and Jamie Lee Curtis gives a surprisingly gripping performance.I knew the film had a comedic side, but I guess I didn't realize that it's more Fast and Furious than it is Mission Impossible. But lets make something clear here, this film's premise works way better with the comedy than it would without. With that being said, I don't think some of the leaps the film made in terms of Curtis' arc were needed. She's definitely a beautiful woman, but in the long scheme of things was the dancing sequence really necessary? Plot wise it just didn't add up why Harry would go about revealing himself in that way. I also thought the second half of the film took a bit of a step back with the lack of Tom Arnold's comedic relief. It took a few scenes to get used to his comedy but when his jokes hit, they hit hard. In many ways his performance carried the first half of the film.In addition to this film being very funny, the action is spectacular for 1994. The film's look is very late 90's and early 2000's so I can see where someone may think it looks dated. But the special effects and action choreography were way ahead of its time. But that's nothing new with James Cameron. It was also funny to see Bill Paxton show up and have fun in his short role, another one of Cameron's frequent collaborators. Charlton Heston's glorified cameo was a nice touch, but there wasn't much closure on his side of things. And finally Brad Fiedel's score was also a pleasant surprise as he did both Terminator films with Cameron. So in all, True Lies is a blast of an action film that tends to get too unrealistic at times, but the performances of Arnold and Curtis make it an unforgettable 90's action comedy, and lets be clear, Cameron is the real hero here.+Special effects +Arnold's having fun +Curtis' coming out party +Tom Arnold -Too goofy at times 8.1\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"30 August 2015","score":"","review":" Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron have been such an efficient Hollywood duo for so many years.

It functions on a level of grace and transcendence that's very difficult to achieve in film, but nevertheless, it soars on gossamer wings of unprecedented, jaw dropping creation, steered to unbelievable depths of human emotion and wonder by its special effects, and revelatory lead performances. Usually I'm leery about films that concern the afterlife, and such lofty concepts. This one has a head on its shoulders though, treating it's touchy, very personal insights with a mature outlook. Robin Williams has never been better as Chris Nielsen, a gentle, caring man, deeply in love with his wonderful wife Annie (Annabella Sciorra), and devoted to his children. Sciorra is mesmerizing as Annie, and this is her finest hour as an actress, finding the hurt, the fear and the confusion in Annie as she journeys to the metaphysical abyss. Chris and her have the perfect life, lovely children and a symmetrical, star crossed love that both performers capture splendidly in some lush early scenes that set a tone of harmony. But then, their children are taken from them in a freak car accident. Soon after, Chris is killed in a horrific highway tunnel crash as well (excellently filmed), leaving Annie on her own. Chris discovers that there is no finality in death, and he's guided into the beyond by the spirit of his former friend and doctor ( a lively Cuba Gooding Jr.). They traverse endless astral planes of staggering beauty, from sun dappled river scenes straight out of Botticelli works, to an oil paint stained paradise literally modelled after the works of Impressionism. It's a startlingly phenomenal sequence that leaps right off the screen at you, and it's no wonder it earned an Oscar for visual effects. Eventually Annie, wracked with loneliness and pain, commits suicide, and is sent to a plane eons away from where Chris is, a dark place where souls that take their own life end up. Chris finds out, and is stubbornly driven by love and devotion to find her, despite being told it's impossible. Thus begins a surreal, just incredible odyssey through the nether realms of spiritual void to find her, orchestrated in a believable way that makes you feel as if you're in some far off dream, and not just observing images on a screen. This film isn't about heaven or hell, pleasure or punishment, it's simply about the state of mind we make for ourselves, and how that affects what comes after. There's no god, no Angels, no demons, no religion here. Just a vast, sprawling dream world of abstraction, bits and pieces of our world, reflected through a subconscious prism and thrown out the other side in a dazzling display of endless spiritual realms piled haphazardly among one another, with no rhyme or reason. When Chris does find Annie, we are treated to an ornate, emotionally exhausting sequence, which both of them nail, and is time capsule worthy. This is profound stuff, spun up in gauzy fantasy, but moored in thought provoking concepts of mortality, cause and effect, and what love really means, in this world and the next. It's an extremely ambitious, thoughtful piece with acting, effects and story that go along way, and in my opinion, combine together to make it an endearing classic.

Robin Williams has never been better as Chris Nielsen, a gentle, caring man, deeply in love with his wonderful wife Annie (Annabella Sciorra), and devoted to his children. Sciorra is mesmerizing as Annie, and this is her finest hour as an actress, finding the hurt, the fear and the confusion in Annie as she journeys to the metaphysical abyss. Chris and her have the perfect life, lovely children and a symmetrical, star crossed love that both performers capture splendidly in some lush early scenes that set a tone of harmony. But then, their children are taken from them in a freak car accident. Soon after, Chris is killed in a horrific highway tunnel crash as well (excellently filmed), leaving Annie on her own. Chris discovers that there is no finality in death, and he's guided into the beyond by the spirit of his former friend and doctor ( a lively Cuba Gooding Jr.). They traverse endless astral planes of staggering beauty, from sun dappled river scenes straight out of Botticelli works, to an oil paint stained paradise literally modelled after the works of Impressionism. It's a startlingly phenomenal sequence that leaps right off the screen at you, and it's no wonder it earned an Oscar for visual effects. Eventually Annie, wracked with loneliness and pain, commits suicide, and is sent to a plane eons away from where Chris is, a dark place where souls that take their own life end up. Chris finds out, and is stubbornly driven by love and devotion to find her, despite being told it's impossible. Thus begins a surreal, just incredible odyssey through the nether realms of spiritual void to find her, orchestrated in a believable way that makes you feel as if you're in some far off dream, and not just observing images on a screen. This film isn't about heaven or hell, pleasure or punishment, it's simply about the state of mind we make for ourselves, and how that affects what comes after. There's no god, no Angels, no demons, no religion here. Just a vast, sprawling dream world of abstraction, bits and pieces of our world, reflected through a subconscious prism and thrown out the other side in a dazzling display of endless spiritual realms piled haphazardly among one another, with no rhyme or reason. When Chris does find Annie, we are treated to an ornate, emotionally exhausting sequence, which both of them nail, and is time capsule worthy. This is profound stuff, spun up in gauzy fantasy, but moored in thought provoking concepts of mortality, cause and effect, and what love really means, in this world and the next. It's an extremely ambitious, thoughtful piece with acting, effects and story that go along way, and in my opinion, combine together to make it an endearing classic.

Seriously Cage has been doing it all wrong all these years and needs to learn from his 1988 self. I am convinced that nobody could have performed in this role better.I love the campy 80's vibe and music and clothing, but that's only the beginning of the entertainment. Cage essentially plays the same general character as Christian Bale in American Psycho (which was inspired by this movie FYI, look at the Trivia section) - a fairly well-off businessman who is slowly losing his mind. That is literally the whole plot. Again why this movie is solid gold.This is not a vampire movie. It took me almost the entirety of the movie to realize that fact, and some people who gave it poor ratings probably didn't come to that realization. Cage is dissatisfied with his lifestyle of going out and sleeping with different women every night, so he just cracks. That is what Cage does best. This movie has some of my favorite Cage-isms that I didn't know were in this movie. 1. Nicholas Cage creepy face meme 2. Well, I was really horny at the time. 3. Am I getting through to you, Alva? 4.

The story concerns a nuclear attack against Russia, set into motion by the mad General Ripper in an effort to preserve our, precious bodily fluids'. The attacks is told from the perspectives of the Bombing crew sent to deliver the payload, the paranoid Ripper and his assistant Mandrake and a War Room full of Generals and Politicians frantically trying to stop the attack.To properly examine the film I will divide the review into the films capacity as a satire and as a comedy, the two being at opposing ends of a spectrum.In terms of satire the film is a masterclass. There is not a moment in the film where someone or something isn't being mocked. The major target of the film is the ridiculous situation of peace being maintained via mutually assured destruction; analogized brilliantly with the impending apocalypse of nuclear war. In an effort to avoid spoilers I will only mention that masculinity, paranoia, American patriotism, religion, international politics, capitalism and insecurity are all satirized and are all done so brilliantly.Moreover the very fact that the feature is a comedy promotes the silliness of the situation and the actors do a brilliant job balancing silliness with seriousness. Peter Sellers is excellent as Colonel Mandrake and the President and George C. Scott as General Turgidson is brilliantly animated and mirrors the insanity of Ripper excellently. The dialogue is witty and the performances carry such zeal that they make most of the film enjoyable.This is where I ruin the fun. For all the clever satire and witty dialogue the film suffers from one major problem. It isn't that funny. I know comedy is subjective and that's why I can't say it was funny. I simply didn't think it was. There are massive tracks of dialogue dedicated to exposition, particularly in the first act, and the entire bombing crew storyline is a bore, with maybe one or two jokes in all. Furthermore I found entire conversations without any humor in them, Bat Guano holding Mandrake prisoner just wasn't funny and the eponymous Doctor just wasn't funny, it's as if there was no intent to make this funny and the performers tried to awkwardly portray a comedy out of a thriller.I don't mean to be harsh there is some good comedy in here. The neurotic President was hilarious when talking to the Russian Premier, Mandrake got a few laughs out of me and Turgidson's energy and over-characterization was pretty funny. However the film is not funny enough to work really well. As I said the concept is funny, there was just too much exposition and not enough jokes.Distinct from the films comical and satirical elements are the sets.

The War Room and B52 Bomber deserve special mention; the former being stylishly gorgeous with the latter being eerily realistic. In addition the music is great, but not brilliant, and the pace was good, though it did drag just a bit during the bomber sequences.It's hard to write a review for a Kubrick film without trickling into analysis and this film is no exception.

A hot young cast featuring future Captain America, future Lyold Christmas, and a buncha future nobodies including Lacey Chabert, who most likely has achieved nothing in her life since she isn't a giant movie star entertaining me since being a giant movie star is the only thing that means anything in this world, Jaime Pressly, who's actually done so good with roles like Joe Dirt or My Name Is Earl but I feel like she deserves better roles.........because Jaime's so incredibly hot, the 3 underclassmen, who are Wang Chung, a kid looking like he's trying out for the lead starring role in Preteen Wolf The Nerdy Acne Years, and a Chris Klein's look-a-like. Not Another Teen Movie recreates fine scenes from others of America's favorite classic teenage comedies such as American Pie, Cruel Intentions, Varsity Blues, The Breakfast Club, American Beauty, Never Been Kissed, She's the One, Bring It On, 10 Things I Hate About You, Almost Famous, Can't Hardly Wait, and Road Trip as it perfectly and hilariously spoofs them all which are all teen movies. No reason not to see this really raunchy and seriously sexually exposed teenage comedy from the early '00s with a proper sense of humor that delivers the goods, big time. I first thought of giving Not Another Teen Movie a 5 because it's so shitbrained but then I realized I was just being a shitbrain myself so I changed and now I believe it is a 7. So I'll give it a 6. It's so funny! Watch this high school movie with your friends, over and over again. The voices from the side are terrific as are all the super hot babes doing and saying things really hot like lead star Chyler Leigh, who's intro scene is seriously appealing, Jaime Pressly, who looks hotter than anybody in her cheer uniform plus her next-to-nothing sexy little outfits she wears, Mia Kirshner, who does everything way cross the line sexually, big time, and Cerina Vincent, who is literally just naked the whole time.....with a killer rack.

A hot young cast featuring future Captain America, future Lyold Christmas, and a buncha future nobodies including Lacey Chabert, who most likely has achieved nothing in her life since she isn't a giant movie star entertaining me since being a giant movie star is the only thing that means anything in this world, Jaime Pressly, who's actually done so good with roles like Joe Dirt or My Name Is Earl but I feel like she deserves better roles.........because Jaime's so incredibly hot, the 3 underclassmen, who are Wang Chung, a kid looking like he's trying out for the lead starring role in Preteen Wolf The Nerdy Acne Years, and a Chris Klein's look-a-like. Not Another Teen Movie recreates fine scenes from others of America's favorite classic teenage comedies such as American Pie, Cruel Intentions, Varsity Blues, The Breakfast Club, American Beauty, Never Been Kissed, She's the One, Bring It On, 10 Things I Hate About You, Almost Famous, Can't Hardly Wait, and Road Trip as it perfectly and hilariously spoofs them all which are all teen movies. No reason not to see this really raunchy and seriously sexually exposed teenage comedy from the early '00s with a proper sense of humor that delivers the goods, big time. I first thought of giving Not Another Teen Movie a 5 because it's so shitbrained but then I realized I was just being a shitbrain myself so I changed and now I believe it is a 7. So I'll give it a 6. It's so funny! Watch this high school movie with your friends, over and over again.

Although the storytelling is rather weak, the writers provide so many humorous scenes that to me it very rarely mattered. Lee Marvin is the main reason to see this and his performance here was nothing short of sublime. Although Marvin was great here, I was a little disappointed with Eastwood. The truth of the matter is that his character was a bit bland and nowhere near as interesting as Marvin's character. However, the blame for this lies with the writers and not Eastwood and I just didn't find his character that interesting and also found the chemistry between Eastwood and Marvin was a bit hit and miss.The musical numbers here are colourful, lively and very enjoyable (I don't think there was one song that I didn't like). However, usually with musicals songs are used to cover plot points or to convey emotions from characters. In Paint Your Wagon there were a couple of songs here that worked in this manner, but a lot of songs were rather random and had nothing to do with the story. Again this isn't a major problem as the musical numbers were fun, but again it made the story a little strange at times.Where this film really comes good is in its final third (when we get to the point of the story) and the final act was absolutely hilarious.On balance there is definitely more good than bad here. Despite the fact that there was no real story for the first two thirds of the film, there were still enough fun moments to make this worthwhile overall. However, Lee Marvin's superb performance and incredibly funny on-screen antics are definitely the biggest selling points here.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Musical"},{"date":"30 August 2015","score":"","review":" In a near-future eugenics-based world, where one's genetic superiority defines their ease of success in society, Andrew Niccol's 'Gattaca' explores the story of two men who have been affected by it; too much was expected of one and he succumbs to pressure, and nothing much was expected of the other and he tries to go against those expectations to achieve his dream. In this hypothetical gene-discriminatory society, the film's essential theme is of one's value and destiny; whether we define it or someone\/something does, ultimately, it's upto us.The casting is good, and the acting is commendable. Though it's a science-fiction film, it didn't need any special effects to explore its themes; it made use of the well-designed sets and captivatingly-coloured cinematography.The ideas explored in the film are intriguing and thought-provoking, but other than the lead character Vincent, whose description would take five sentences, other characters' descriptions would take just one. Especially, Irene (Uma Thurman), of whom we get to know nothing. Most of the movie is a cat and mouse chase, with characters dancing around the lines of morals and ethics, not that it wasn't entertaining.Overall, it's a film which is firm in its stand against discrimination, and inspires people to against all odds to fulfill their passion; an interesting sci-fi parable about destiny.
