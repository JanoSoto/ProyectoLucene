Then I found myself watching the film a week later, and I thought it was awesome from that moment. I find this happens a lot, don't judge films on the first watch, watch them again and then comment! Lost In Translation and Con-Air are films which also fell into the category of being OK on first watch, but awesome from there on after.From the very start of the film when the name 'Cocktail' flashes up in pink neon, then 'Starship - Wild Again' begins to play, you have an opening scene that makes you feel good and makes you wanna keep watching.I've often had day-dreams of moving to a far away place to start a fresh career, and Brian Flannagan (Cruise) does just this. Its not an path to easy-money as Brian soons finds out,there are pitfalls at every corner, and working at a cocktail bar seemed like a daunting, last job you'd want in the world. But he seems to make the role of barman very appealing, maybe its the free and easy women that seem to flock I dunno, either way, I'd give bar-tending a go after watching this movie. Having a boss like Doug (Brian Brown), who's basically a chilled out, the kind of boss you could have a laugh with every-shift kinda guy, would also make the job that bit better.He clearly didn't set out to be a full time bar-tender,thats why he enrols at the local New York College. Myself, being a student can relate to the scene where the lecturer is talking about the 'money multiplier'. I've often been sat in lectures thinking what the hell is this guy going on about? As people all around you seem to be engaged and nodding at everything he says.When he leaves New York and heads to Jamaica, I was kind of thinking the movie would go downhill, and you do kind of miss New York, in other movies they would keep linking back to New York, but with Brian having no connections with New York (having fallen out with Doug) it would of seemed inappropriate to keep going back there.The sun, sea and money of Jamaica is very appealing but there's only one thing that makes the trip worthwhile and thats when he bumps into Jordan (Shue). What a beauty! In my view Top Gun was a great film but lacked a bombshell, no offence Kelly McGillis, but she didn't really do it for me. In Elisabeth Shue, Cocktail hit the jackpot.When he returns to New York, you get the feeling its last chance saloon time, where he really can't afford anymore slip-ups. He patched things up with Doug but you get the feeling he would would rather be independent then working for his buddy again! And after messing things up with Jordan, going with a rich, but much older women, he finds himself in limbo when that falls through.Once Doug commits suicide, there is only one option he can now pursue and thats winning back Jordan. Its a typical chick flick ending, but I still think the film rocks. The soundtrack is under-rated in my view, I love the music in Jamaica 'Shelter from Your Love' and 'Oh, I Love You So' are both great songs.To conclude, this movie is a must see for any aspiring wannabee millionaire business-men, like myself. I would also like Elisabeth Shue and a friend like Doug as well, but beggars can't be choosers.!

Like the title suggests, this is at least as much Pee Wee Herman's film that it is Tim Burton's. In fact Herman has also made the script. Tim Burton's movies are important to me, just like to so many people who grew up in the late eighties and nineties. This don't feel like a Burton movie very much, so I try to review it as an independent movie. It's a movie about a weirdo guy who lives in his own childish fantasy world. To me it feels more like a pictorial of some kind of mental problems than, say, a funny comedy for children. Anyway the main character is about 35 years old. The viewpoint of the movie is from this guys perspective, from where everything seems miraculous. Pee Wee is more like a sad clown, not someone who would make you, or at least me, laugh. In all his strangeness he's kinda unhuman and distant. I think this film portrays this guys communication with the world quite interestingly; he don't have much contact with it. But, there is another possible way to watch at least some parts of this film, and I realised that only after the first twenty minutes or so As an old time-style comedy. Pee Wee Herman is just like some Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd or Chaplin -kind of mute comedy character. Only difference is that now we would have the sound, the capability to communicate by speaking. If you would want it. With no doubt this is also a tribute to those old movies. In any case, I think this movie is quite boring; at least it don't manage to get me interested of itself. Maybe it is a children movie, that only children are able to watch. Generally I think that most of the best children's stories work also for adults, and have many different dimensions and depths to see for people of any age. But this don't work like that. I think the other Burton's work I've seen from the beginning of his career (I mean before he started to make REALLY great films), for example Amazing Stories episode Family Dog (with Brad Bird) and other animation Vincent are really great movies, and I would recommend those instead of this, if you'd have to choose. But because you do not have to choose, and if you're interested, then see this just for the general education. It's not bad, it's just boring.

But I was surprised It wasn't as bad as everyone said it was and just because it wasn't good as the first two (The Godfather was made in the 1972 and The Godfather Part II was made in 1974) this last installment of the trilogy serves the whole saga some justice because it gives a nice deliverable ending to two cinematic masterpieces.The film begins with a haunting memory of the Tahoe estate. Then cuts into Michael being honored by his church and mirroring a celebration of the first two parts. (but held indoors!)When Anthony (D'Ambrosio) tells Michael he wants no part in the family business and wants to pursue a life in music, Michael reluctantly agrees. But then pops the alternative Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia) comes in with the support of his own of Connie, Michael's sister (Talia Shire) to meet Michael. He is the illegitimate son of Sonny, Michael's brother and he tells Michael that Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna) has been bad-mouthing him behind his back. Vincent, like his father, has a temper and is prone to doing things without thinking. He wants to join Michael and leaves Zasa so Michael takes Vincent in, reluctantly.The main plot in the film is actually quite confusing and I don't know if I'll fully explain it in the correct terms Michael wants to buy a company called Immobiliare, which is controlled by the Vatican. Don Altobello, who becomes furious that his mafia would not be included into the deal because of Michael's hunger of being legitimate - he wants to keep the company as legitimate as possible because that has been his ultimate Americanized dream.There are a few subplots, including the rather disturbing but at the same time I must admit as rather sweet incest romance between Mary (Coppola) and Vincent (Garcia). When Mary approaches Vincent and he tells her to Love somebody else just breaks my heart for some reason.Another one that I thought was fantastically written was probably the dialog between Michael (Pacino) and Kay (Keaton). Why? Even though it seemed misplaced (since it was written in later) I thought it would of had been terrific in another film. But too bad, it's already in this film When Kay comes to Sicily for their son's debut in an opera and Michael is there to finish off the Vatican deal, he shows her around the city and those moments are priceless. These are great actors doing great dialog and the scene where Michael and Kay are both in that room and he tells her he still loves her and she starts breaking down - I think I was going to cry as well. But after thinking about it a while What happened to the abortion in Part II? (Goodness, he started yelling her and then later slapped her ...) Did it just disappear out of Michael's mind or is this a very different film? And yes, it is a very different film - with flaws that we can just forget and move on with our lives.The man is suffering &#150; he even has a diabetic stroke in the course of the film. But this is a man who has done evilness.The acting isn't all as bad people say it is. I want to start off with Sofia Coppola who has received two Razzies for her performance - if it wasn't for those bad reviews I would never had noticed that her acting sucked. My mind just paid attention to her acting - and other than how her voice sounded so unnatural and strange, she wasn't as bad as people say she was. And there's Andy Garcia, who beat out quite a number of people for the role of Vincent and even though he wasn't really deserving of his Oscar-nom, he did quite well adjusting to his character when his character had no development whatsoever (I mean, he became Don in just uh - 2 weeks?). There is Talia Shire, who is probably one of the best gems in the film. She is malicious and as sweet as poison and that's why I loved her here. Keaton turns in a mustered-up performance of a Oscar-winner (Annie Hall). And for all the love\/hate comments for Al Pacino - he's on top of his game and you know what? He may be the best thing in the whole entire film. The silent scream scene in unforgettable.So my critique of the film? I think this is *the* film I would be willing to watch again if I was to choose between the three. Why? Because this is my favorite film even though it wasn't the best film (Part II is the best if you asked me). This film is a nostalgic surprise (with one too many flashbacks from the first two) and Francis Ford Coppola (who has admitted he made the film for financial reasons) does a fantastic job. I thought the shots looked more modern because sixteen years is a lot of time to improvise on skills of film-making which makes a very different motion picture. I think Part III felt more like a Hollywood blockbuster\/wannabe Oscar bait. But all in all, it's a very entertaining film (yeah, it may be confusing but still enjoyable).The Godfather Part III is also surprisingly funny (When I'm dead, I'm gonna be really smart). I didn't expect that coming!

Because this is my favorite film even though it wasn't the best film (Part II is the best if you asked me). This film is a nostalgic surprise (with one too many flashbacks from the first two) and Francis Ford Coppola (who has admitted he made the film for financial reasons) does a fantastic job. I thought the shots looked more modern because sixteen years is a lot of time to improvise on skills of film-making which makes a very different motion picture. I think Part III felt more like a Hollywood blockbuster\/wannabe Oscar bait. But all in all, it's a very entertaining film (yeah, it may be confusing but still enjoyable).The Godfather Part III is also surprisingly funny (When I'm dead, I'm gonna be really smart). I didn't expect that coming! ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"7 February 2006","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Before I saw The Godfather Part III, I read many negative reviews (except for Roger Ebert's) about it and I had my mind set on watching a horrid movie because I was such a fan of the first two. But I was surprised It wasn't as bad as everyone said it was and just because it wasn't good as the first two (The Godfather was made in the 1972 and The Godfather Part II was made in 1974) this last installment of the trilogy serves the whole saga some justice because it gives a nice deliverable ending to two cinematic masterpieces.The film begins with a haunting memory of the Tahoe estate. Then cuts into Michael being honored by his church and mirroring a celebration of the first two parts. (but held indoors!)When Anthony (D'Ambrosio) tells Michael he wants no part in the family business and wants to pursue a life in music, Michael reluctantly agrees. But then pops the alternative Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia) comes in with the support of his own of Connie, Michael's sister (Talia Shire) to meet Michael. He is the illegitimate son of Sonny, Michael's brother and he tells Michael that Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna) has been bad-mouthing him behind his back. Vincent, like his father, has a temper and is prone to doing things without thinking. He wants to join Michael and leaves Zasa so Michael takes Vincent in, reluctantly.The main plot in the film is actually quite confusing and I don't know if I'll fully explain it in the correct terms Michael wants to buy a company called Immobiliare, which is controlled by the Vatican. Don Altobello, who becomes furious that his mafia would not be included into the deal because of Michael's hunger of being legitimate - he wants to keep the company as legitimate as possible because that has been his ultimate Americanized dream.There are a few subplots, including the rather disturbing but at the same time I must admit as rather sweet incest romance between Mary (Coppola) and Vincent (Garcia). When Mary approaches Vincent and he tells her to Love somebody else just breaks my heart for some reason.Another one that I thought was fantastically written was probably the dialog between Michael (Pacino) and Kay (Keaton). Why? Even though it seemed misplaced (since it was written in later) I thought it would of had been terrific in another film. But too bad, it's already in this film When Kay comes to Sicily for their son's debut in an opera and Michael is there to finish off the Vatican deal, he shows her around the city and those moments are priceless. These are great actors doing great dialog and the scene where Michael and Kay are both in that room and he tells her he still loves her and she starts breaking down - I think I was going to cry as well. But after thinking about it a while What happened to the abortion in Part II? (Goodness, he started yelling her and then later slapped her ...) Did it just disappear out of Michael's mind or is this a very different film? And yes, it is a very different film - with flaws that we can just forget and move on with our lives.The man is suffering &#150; he even has a diabetic stroke in the course of the film. But this is a man who has done evilness.The acting isn't all as bad people say it is. I want to start off with Sofia Coppola who has received two Razzies for her performance - if it wasn't for those bad reviews I would never had noticed that her acting sucked. My mind just paid attention to her acting - and other than how her voice sounded so unnatural and strange, she wasn't as bad as people say she was. And there's Andy Garcia, who beat out quite a number of people for the role of Vincent and even though he wasn't really deserving of his Oscar-nom, he did quite well adjusting to his character when his character had no development whatsoever (I mean, he became Don in just uh - 2 weeks?). There is Talia Shire, who is probably one of the best gems in the film. She is malicious and as sweet as poison and that's why I loved her here. Keaton turns in a mustered-up performance of a Oscar-winner (Annie Hall). And for all the love\/hate comments for Al Pacino - he's on top of his game and you know what? He may be the best thing in the whole entire film. The silent scream scene in unforgettable.So my critique of the film?

Frightening scenes and images (especially images) pile up, and make for a movie that is so horrifying, that it actually can make people vegetarian.The plot is barely there. It's about 5 teenagers, who run out of gas in rural Texas, shortly after a creepy encounter with a crazy hitchhiker. They stop at one of their childhood homes, and go exploring. One by one, they wander into the farmhouse next door, which is home to three psychotic cannibal brothers, who are led by the chainsaw wielding maniac, Leatherface. Soon, only Sally (Marilyn Burns) is left, and is frantically on the run from the family.The title is somewhat misleading. The chainsaw is used, that's for sure. But there are only four deaths, and only one of them is with the chainsaw. Also, this movie has no gory scenes. What you see is Leatherface hit someone with a sledgehammer, and you never hear from them again (one of them is put on a meat hook, ends up in the freezer, and that's it). What Leatherface does to his victims is whatever your gruesome imagination wants it to be. The main actress, Marilyn Burns, is very good in her role. Her expression of fear wasn't accurate. It was REAL. She was actually terrified during the filming. The film's most disturbing scene is when she thinks she's going to be helped by the store clerk, but then she sees the meat that's cooking in the barbecue pit.

Also its pretty clear if you watched the original 3 movies that senator Palpatine is going to be the emperor...I mean my star wars toy figure back then was called EMPORER PALPATINE....So that whole Mystery on who is the dark lord of the sith was kinda cheap.I do have to say that the light saber duel is incredible. By far makes the original trilogy sword fights look like there in slow motion. Ray parks the stuntman who had little to say but could wield a double bladed light saber like no tomorrow impressed me beyond belief. Ewan McGregor as young Obi-Wan likewise, excellent.I also enjoyed Liam Nealson as Qui-gon Jin. But on the flip side I wish i could erase Jar jar binks (the CG character) from my memory =P On a side note my young nephew who never saw the original trilogy loved this film. I saw that same look in his eye that i had when i saw return of the Jedi, complete and utter awww at movie making magic. So Lucas does succeed in introducing the star wars universe to a new generation. Also when my nephew later watched the original movies with me, he said they where OK...But looked so Old...I could tell he was not impressed with them as much as he was with phantom menace.However I'm sure many old school fans can only frown and wish for more, as we are grown up...and where desperately hoping for a film that would spark that youthful magic in us again...

With this in mind I was quite surprised to find that I really enjoyed Chopper.As previous reviewers have said, this is essentially a character study rather than a story. The reason it works so well is that Mark Brandon Read is a compelling character beautifully impersonated by Eric Bana. Anyone who's ever seen an interview with Read himself can appreciate what a close impersonation Bana achieves; his sudden guffawing laugh and light-hearted way of talking about his really unpleasant deeds being perfectly copied. The movie manages to do what I'm sure Read himself has achieved in real life - it tricks you into liking him before revealing that his hair-trigger temper and propensity for paranoia and violence make him a dangerous person to be around. The thing that keeps you watching is Chopper's jovial nature but also his unpredictability. In circumstances where other gangsters would have gone on a killing spree, Chopper just shrugs and takes it in his stride.

First of all, Denzel Washington was excellent in this. He deserved the award for best actor, and rightly so, for his work in this film. I hated him in this movie because I hated his character. Which should tell you how good a job he did in the movie. When you hate someone's character in a movie, so much, that generally means we're talking Academy Award. However, I don't think I was meant to hate the movie, too.A new rookie on his first day of Narcatics, meets with his unit leader at ten a.m. Already nervous, about making the team, he has no idea just how nervous he'll be by the end of the day. After only spending two hours with his leader, Hawke starts to become aware of what kind of cop he's dealing with, but only by the end of the film, do we really see what we the audience are given to deal with as well.Ethan Hawke was great in this too, and in some ways I think that he's a better actor than Washington. But, to be fair, Denzel is the star of this movie, and you can't take your eyes off of him, because of his performance in it.Again, it's hard for me to even understand how I felt about the film. I liked it and I thought it was well-written, but it just seemed like such a dark film, and I almost wanted to turn it off sometimes, because it was so frustrating. But, I liked it well enough to give it a seven. So, there we are. Definitely not a film for anyone under seventeen, and not only is there some substance abuse, nudity, language, adult subject matter, and violence, but there is also some scenes that are very heavy to handle.Good performance though, and again...I loved it because I hated it.

Once the bail jumper is nabbed, it's Planes, Trains and Automobiles. DeNiro plays it straight here, but the gems are Grodin, riffing on Woody Allen (These things go down!) and Jack Webb (Then why do they call you Red?), and Kotto (Is this going to upset me?).This movie is the necessary slab in our collective consciousness holding up Goodfellas and Donnie Brasco, etc. Right now, The Sopranos occupies this same psychological space.Cinematically, I can't think of a finer match of a completely original soundtrack (courtesy of Elfman) to the visual narrative, revolving somewhere around Chicago electric blues, Stax and Motown.
