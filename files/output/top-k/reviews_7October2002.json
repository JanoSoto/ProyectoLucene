Also, there were a number of other actors in the film that went on to do great things, including Erik Palladino, Sean Patrick Thomas, Donald Faison, Chris Owen, Clea DuVall, Selma Blair, among others.  Also, a few great cameos including Jenna Elfman, Jerry O'Connell, Melissa Joan Hart, and Breckin Meyer.The story in this film is nothing terribly mind-blowing, but it's just a day after high school graduation, guy likes girl, but never had the chance to express his feelings kind of story, but it is quite touching at times.  One thing that I REALLY like about the story and the film in general is that the film didn't contain any kind of gross-out humor.  I'm getting a little sick of every teen film trying to out-do the previous one in gross-out humor.  It's getting a bit old!  This film pulls off a great story, with great comedy and great acting without trying to out-gross other films of the genre.

This film is worth watching for the opening scene alone, that scene got my undivided attention.Wolfgang Petersen pulls off yet another excellent directorial effort with an all-star cast.  Dustin Hoffman plays his character very well and very convincingly.  Morgan Freeman has an interesting role as a sometimes good and sometimes bad guy.  Donald Sutherland plays a very good antagonist.  Cuba Gooding Jr. does an excellent job as always.  Kevin Spacey and Rene Russo also play their respective roles quite well.  And finally Patrick Dempsey (not a big part, but an important one nonetheless), pulls off a great performance as well.  There's also a small role played by J.T.

Also, I have to mention the monkey, that little monkey did a fantastic job, cute little guy.All in all, I thought this was an excellent thriller\/drama\/action film, it even has a touch of comedy here and there.

At times it seems to be a child's movie and at other times it seems to be for adults.  But nonetheless, I loved the film.  I thought it was a fun story.The special effects alone are worth watching the film.  It's truly amazing how fluidly the toys move and life-like the little toys are.  Also, I really liked the various Gorgonite characters, they all looked quite unique.The cast is quite good too.  Phil Hartman is quite funny in the film, as usual.  Kirsten Dunst pulls off a great performance.  The rest of the cast is quite good as well Gregory Smith, Jay Mohr, David Cross, Denis Leary, and Kevin Dunn, to name a few.  I really feel that actors in films like this don't get the credit they deserve, because they are acting against small little harmless platic or metal animatronic toys, or, in some cases, against nothing at all.  So just keep that in mind when you're watching this film.  The voice talents in this film are also quite good, with plenty of big names to go around including Tommy Lee Jones, Frank Langella, Ernest Borgnine, Jim Brown, Bruce Dern, George Kennedy, Clint Walker, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, Harry Shearer, and Christina Ricci.This film is just a fun film, there's nothing terribly deep or mind-boggling about this film, just enjoy it for what it is.

I watched it because it got really good review in a local newspaper. Thanks to reviewer for emphasizing the greatness of this movie - otherwise I may have never seen it.Before sunrise really stamped its mark into my mind. As I said it has been something like five years now since I first saw it. During the years I forgot most of the films plot but still remembered how strongly it had touched me at one time.About a week ago I found a copy of Before sunrise in a shelf in library and lent it. I had tried to find it from video stores few times but hadn't succeed. I watched it three times during the weekend and I have to point out that this film is even greater than I remembered it to be. It's a little story about two quite ordinary people getting to know, like and love each other. It's about two everyday people - you or me, anyone of us - sitting in a train, walking in streets and doing basically nothing exceptional, and still it avoids being banal nor boring in any way. Its strength is in its realism; everything Celine and Jesse do and say is captured to a tape in so natural way. Identifying yourself with the characters is inevitable. Ending is perfect - it makes a watcher to continue the film in his\/hers own mind as he\/she likes and so the movie keeps one in tight grip long after it has ended. I suppose that experiencing a love bigger than life is a fantasy number 1 for most people and describing that fantasy is what this film does without doing a single mistake.I love Before sunrise. It hasn't any special effects or unbelievable turns in a plot but it has touched my heart deeper than any other film before (sunrise, sunset or whatever, ha ha), and I think that it's all that matters in a subjective level. The stronger emotional experience a movie gives, the higher I rank it. I'm sure there's a lot of people out there who can enjoy Before sunrise as much as I did (and do) if they just give it a chance. On the other hand I'm afraid that people who are totally happy with their lives won't enjoy this film so much. It requires some kind of miserable mentality combined to hopes for better times.Before sunrise is a film that uses little maneuvers in portraying big emotions. It makes me feel like it could be me on the screen. I hope that some day I have a chance to love some woman as much as I love this film.Fantastic piece of art.

The word's Snuff and porn were thrown at me but i never really investigated what the people meant by that. So... getting to the story A private investigator Tom Wells (Nicholas Cage) is hired by an old widower to investigate whether a recently discovered 8MM Snuff film is actually real. Wells watches the film and in trying to prove that the horror he saw is fake and the whole movie follows his investigations to prove the girl Mary Ann Matthews is still alive.8MM is not a good film... it's story demands that you cannot leave this film without being like the enemies of the state without being slightly effected by it. The Story is an excellent premise but would have worked slightly better if the movie was shot slightly gritty then it is. Joel Schumacher does a great job with it but it still seems a little too Hollywood to pack a real punch (even though the graphicness of the movie- goes against it) The placings are great- you are on an edge from beginning to end and that is where the movie succeeds, you like Tom do not know what to exspect. As for the performances Nicholas Cage is awful in 8MM, so awful in fact that some of the scenes are unwatchable, he just seems so Woodern that any emotions you could feel for the character (until the sentimental last 5 minutes) are gone. On the other hand the supporting cast is great, Catherine Keener tries to make the best of a bad situation and Joaquin Phoenix is absoutely amazing as the porn shop clerk, he brings black comedy as well as real emotion to the role and he steals every scene he is in. Overall 8MM is a gritty movie or as much as it could be with it's limitations of a big screen hollywood movie but it hits the right notes and the character of Tom Wells is very encouraging as it somewhat shows someone doing something wrong but that not all good things are the right thing to do. The direction is thought through, Schumacher has defiently given the supports a lot of work (sadly missing on cage though), The sorroundings are edgy and dark and the movie footage is sick enough to understand the darkness of the movie. Overall a slightly tied up verison of Seven, with slightly better and pointful direction and a script which packs a punch.

On the other hand the supporting cast is great, Catherine Keener tries to make the best of a bad situation and Joaquin Phoenix is absoutely amazing as the porn shop clerk, he brings black comedy as well as real emotion to the role and he steals every scene he is in. Overall 8MM is a gritty movie or as much as it could be with it's limitations of a big screen hollywood movie but it hits the right notes and the character of Tom Wells is very encouraging as it somewhat shows someone doing something wrong but that not all good things are the right thing to do. The direction is thought through, Schumacher has defiently given the supports a lot of work (sadly missing on cage though), The sorroundings are edgy and dark and the movie footage is sick enough to understand the darkness of the movie. Overall a slightly tied up verison of Seven, with slightly better and pointful direction and a script which packs a punch.

Taken on its own, it's a more than watchable genre film. However, it seems woefully inadequate compared to the director's previous outings. Films such as JFK, Nixon, or Natural Born Killers were vintage Stone compelling works that dealt with controversial topics, all in a thought-provoking manner. U-Turn has nothing truly meaningful to say. It's just a technical exercise in comparison. Granted, it's a very well-made film, with stylish flourishes throughout, but it fails to add much prestige to his oeuvre. I hope this is just a temporary slump and not a downward trend that will eventually end his career.Still, once you accept the fact that he made it on a lark, it provides a good two hours of solid entertainment, though it starts to wear thin in the last third. This twisted film is very mean-spirited at times, to the point where you get numb to the nasty tone after a while. There's no real point to all this, and it's depressing to see what a loser the main character turns out to be. Directorially, it's not nearly as self-indulgent as Natural Born Killers, but it has its share of odd camera angles and multiple film stocks. The dead-end town is deliberately exaggerated, hilariously so at times, in a way so that the protagonist seems trapped in a waking nightmare.Even if he's skimped on the story, he hasn't done so on the cast. Sean Penn is excellent as a drifter whose car breaks down in the middle of nowhere. Fate conspires to keep him stranded in this miserable little dump. His performance is nothing less than riveting, providing the audience with its main point of reference throughout the twists and turns. To be frank, this movie just wouldn't be very interesting without him. He is one of the best active performers. Jennifer Lopez's recent acting turns have been critically lambasted, but U-Turn proves that she can do a pretty good job, given the proper material. Nick Nolte is effective as her shady, white-trash husband. Billy Bob Thornton is hilariously disgusting (and unrecognizable) as a greasy mechanic who keeps short-changing the hero, to the point where it seems as if he's making a deliberate effort to keep him stranded here forever. My favorite supporting performance comes from Claire Danes as a local girl who clings to Penn as her only ticket home. She's so funny that I wished that her character had played a much larger role in the story.I wish he had turned over the directing chores to someone like Guy Ritchie, who would probably have been more at home with the material. Sadly, the box-office failure of Nixon has jeopardized his goals at making more political films, forcing mediocre projects in his hands.

At one time in my life I was trying to make films, and experienced many of the same problems Mark Borchardt did in trying to make HIS film. And I also went through a protracted period of self-absorbed arrested development, where I refused to grow. But then, miraculously, I got married, and had kids.

That is what an mature, responsible adult does. Mark hasn't faced up to that reality as yet, and so, in that sense, he is a retarded adolescent. For this reason, there is a hopelessness about him. Like Don Quixote, he seems so inept and self-deluded that he doesn't realize how bad off he really is. The viewer feels a sense of superiority and pity for him and his circle. Mark has kids and an ex-wife and bills to pay, but the film depicts him caring basically only about pursuing his artistic vision. Despite this, Mark comes across in the film as a likeable individual, surrounded by a very interesting family and group of friends. Unfortunately, Mark lacks many of the things necessary to be successful both in life and in a career maturity, responsibility, education, knowledge, life experience, prioritization, financial clout, etc..

Except it does not exactly live up to the hype. It even makes me wonder if director Sam Mendes was more than a bit lucky in pulling off American Beauty, a film which was not only captivating and thrilling to watch, but whose greatness relied heavily on the considerable consensual reality of critics and audiences that read a lot into the movie that wasn't actually stated. Fine &#150; I got the point with AB; finding a point worth bothering about in Road to Perdition on the other hand, is like trying to find flavour in a limp MacDonalds burger that has somehow been served up at the Ritz. Cinematography is gorgeous &#150; the scenes are beautifully shot &#150; they all look like a definitive breed of gangster movie and any of them would make wonderful posters to grace the wall of the local Odeon; sadly, the motion picture itself here is rather less than the sum of its parts. The characterisation is one-dimensional and Hanks (wooden throughout) very mis-cast. An interminable number of scenes end with long drawn-out pregnant pauses (with or without a nice John Williams musical slow-fade) in which the viewer might be invited to add some Deep Meaning. But does the film warrant such effort? Not in this viewer's opinion. The actions of the main characters often seem at odds with the personalities portrayed (would they really have done that?). The voice overs are trite and predictable. The moral dilemmas are reduced to absurd simplicity and repeated over and over again as if the audience might have nodded off (an understandable temptation.)The story follows reluctant henchman Tom Hanks doing his best to be an upright hitman out of gratitude to the big boss (Paul Newman) who has given him the means to provide for his family by following a life of crime. His young son finds out what he does for a living and Hanks tries to protect him from growing up as a gangster.It really is incredibly slow, but in an `isn't this artistic?' self-indulgent way. I am reminded of the career of that once amazing actor, Meryl Streep &#150; she turned in great performances until she seemed to feel she had &#145;clocked' what made an &#145;award-winning performance.' From then on in many of her films, there would be little pauses to allow the viewer a moment to admire the brilliance of how she had just delivered those wonderful lines &#150; and lead one critic to coin the phrase `doing a Meryl Streep'. In Road to Perdition, Mendes has a self-satisfied approach to directing that keeps inviting viewers to admire the Sam Mendes Moments. Oscars might be there for cinematography, but as a directorial second feature this has the trappings rather than the substance of greatness.Some light relief is provided by a sickly photographer character played by Jude Law, who specialises in taking photographs of the dead &#150; or recently dead &#150; and doesn't mind helping people on their way for a monetary consideration and the chance of a good, saleable photo. His part is based on a real 1930's photographer, some of whose pictures appear in the film. The character has no moral dilemmas he is just plain nasty!Road to Perdition follows a middle road, very slowly, and contains small amount of blood-curdling gore but not enough to keep real gorehounds satisfied &#150; just enough to upset those who don't like that kind of thing I expect. But the movie is aimed at a more discerning market and fails to deliver. Even reading meaning into the title (perdition = utter loss) satisfies only in a banal sort of way. It would be true to say that although the film is paved with good intentions it suggests the director has failed to capitalise on the artistic success of his earlier American Beauty and has taken the road to box office mediocrity and bankability.

Except it does not exactly live up to the hype. It even makes me wonder if director Sam Mendes was more than a bit lucky in pulling off American Beauty, a film which was not only captivating and thrilling to watch, but whose greatness relied heavily on the considerable consensual reality of critics and audiences that read a lot into the movie that wasn't actually stated. Fine &#150; I got the point with AB; finding a point worth bothering about in Road to Perdition on the other hand, is like trying to find flavour in a limp MacDonalds burger that has somehow been served up at the Ritz. Cinematography is gorgeous &#150; the scenes are beautifully shot &#150; they all look like a definitive breed of gangster movie and any of them would make wonderful posters to grace the wall of the local Odeon; sadly, the motion picture itself here is rather less than the sum of its parts. The characterisation is one-dimensional and Hanks (wooden throughout) very mis-cast. An interminable number of scenes end with long drawn-out pregnant pauses (with or without a nice John Williams musical slow-fade) in which the viewer might be invited to add some Deep Meaning. But does the film warrant such effort? Not in this viewer's opinion. The actions of the main characters often seem at odds with the personalities portrayed (would they really have done that?). The voice overs are trite and predictable. The moral dilemmas are reduced to absurd simplicity and repeated over and over again as if the audience might have nodded off (an understandable temptation.)The story follows reluctant henchman Tom Hanks doing his best to be an upright hitman out of gratitude to the big boss (Paul Newman) who has given him the means to provide for his family by following a life of crime. His young son finds out what he does for a living and Hanks tries to protect him from growing up as a gangster.It really is incredibly slow, but in an `isn't this artistic?' self-indulgent way. I am reminded of the career of that once amazing actor, Meryl Streep &#150; she turned in great performances until she seemed to feel she had &#145;clocked' what made an &#145;award-winning performance.' From then on in many of her films, there would be little pauses to allow the viewer a moment to admire the brilliance of how she had just delivered those wonderful lines &#150; and lead one critic to coin the phrase `doing a Meryl Streep'. In Road to Perdition, Mendes has a self-satisfied approach to directing that keeps inviting viewers to admire the Sam Mendes Moments. Oscars might be there for cinematography, but as a directorial second feature this has the trappings rather than the substance of greatness.Some light relief is provided by a sickly photographer character played by Jude Law, who specialises in taking photographs of the dead &#150; or recently dead &#150; and doesn't mind helping people on their way for a monetary consideration and the chance of a good, saleable photo. His part is based on a real 1930's photographer, some of whose pictures appear in the film. The character has no moral dilemmas he is just plain nasty!Road to Perdition follows a middle road, very slowly, and contains small amount of blood-curdling gore but not enough to keep real gorehounds satisfied &#150; just enough to upset those who don't like that kind of thing I expect. But the movie is aimed at a more discerning market and fails to deliver. Even reading meaning into the title (perdition = utter loss) satisfies only in a banal sort of way. It would be true to say that although the film is paved with good intentions it suggests the director has failed to capitalise on the artistic success of his earlier American Beauty and has taken the road to box office mediocrity and bankability.
