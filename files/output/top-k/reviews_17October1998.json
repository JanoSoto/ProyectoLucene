I've read and seen several reviews of this movie now that heaped lavish praise on the acting, the story, the direction, the music, the important social themes, Oprah's heroic quest to have the film made, etc, while warning that viewers who haven't read the novel might be a bit confused in places. What a cop out! As another reviewer has remarked, it seems like some serious Emperor's New Clothes action is going on here. C'mon, who's gonna have the guts to step up to the plate and pan the movie that stars (and is produced by) the most powerful woman in show-biz? I keep getting the image of a drunken, ashamed Joseph Cotton in Citizen Kane, typing up his glowing review of Kane's opera-singing wife...this movie is that bad!I've heard the novel is great. With some imagination (and maybe a couple of tequilas), I could still see how that might be true. But the movie has to stand on its own, folks! Director Jonathan Demme's excellent Silence of the Lambs sure did. This one, however, falls flat the plot just wanders along from episode to confusing episode (with frequent and annoying use of extended fade-outs).Worse, despite all the horrifying things that happen to them, the movie's characters don't generate much sympathy. Why? Because while there's a strong sense of inner tumult, and lots of Exorcist-style physical turmoil (flying tables and glowing red lights -- gimme a break!!!) there's no sense of any real inner conflict. The characters just react -- to the inhumanity of the white slaveowners, or to the frequent supernatural outbursts. There's no evidence in their actions that there's anything they've had to weigh or be confused by. The things that have happened to Sethe (Oprah) are revealed in flashback form, so unfortunately there's not much chance for you as viewer to get involved in them -- it's stuff that's already happened, and you're just being filled in, in shorthand form (prefab context).Another major problem this thing is WAY too long.

I happen to belong to the school of thought which feels that The Producers is funny but all of the other Brooks films are idiotic. Regardless of one's personal opinion, The Twelve Chairs marks the transition to Brooks's most popular and successful period, and is of interest for that reason.I was also curious to see this one because it's based on Ilf and Petrov's hard-to-find book, considered a Soviet classic, and often mentioned in overviews of Russian literature. (I should really know more about that aspect since my IMDb ID is a character from Pushkin.) I hadn't realized the book had inspired so many productions until I browsed the IMDb.So for a couple of different reasons, I've always wanted to see The Twelve Chairs, hoping it would be in the manic style of The Producers. And how did it measure up?I manifested 12 chuckles and was convulsed by one laugh. Not a great score and slow enough to count. Those more open to the broader Brooks style might find more to enjoy. Brooks does avoid being Rabelaisian in this one, as he used to like to put it in interviews, which is a good thing I think. (The rest of us would just say scatological. For any former Soviets new to English and reading this comment, that means there are not a lot of shit and fart jokes.)Picturesque (former) Yugoslav locations stand in for Mother Russia and do very nicely.We get a chance to see Andreas Voutsinas again. He was the memorably fruity hairdresser in The Producers, Carmen Ghia. (That swipe at the Volkswagen sportscar was another of Brooks's jabs at the Germans.) Voutsinas is still fairly swishy in this one but less funny and\/or outrageous. A wasted opportunity.Dom DeLuise does his suicidal schtick that he later reprised in The End with Burt Reynolds. He was responsible for most of my modicums of mirth.Ron Moody appeared here after his triumph in Oliver! as Fagin. A bad career move for Moody -- he ended up in junk almost exclusively after that.

I hope so.The actors are really all pretty good, especially Frank Langella -- it's such a shame that they have so little in the way of a script to work with.These situations could be funnier in more talented hands. Brooks's forte is really as a producer (The Elephant Man), as a gag writer when partnered with someone else (Get Smart with Buck Henry, The 2000-Year-Old Man with Carl Reiner), and as a husband (when partnered with Anne Bancroft).

Good acting by all the actors and quite funny. It's a nice light tale of Billy who loves to produce his own art in the form of polaroids.  He falls in love with the guy that he asks to be his model for his first REAL photo shoot.  The model is supposedly straight but is breaking up with his girlfriend and seems to be slowly opening up to Billy and his lifestyle.  Billy thinks he can have him but isn't sure if he's gay or not.  Finally they get together but it's the model's first time and it falls through.  He loses the model to a bigger shoot by another photo artist.  The model goes to Catalina Island and Billy and others are invited (sort of) to the party afterwards.  Billy chases after his model love just to find that his model has fallen in love with someone else.  He also discovers that one of his best friends has loved him from afar for sometime but he never knew it.  At the end he finally get's his photos seen at a show and another friend introduces him to someone else that loves his work and you can see that he is probably headed for love again and you leave the movie feeling that he is going to live happily ever after with the new friend.I feel the movie is great because it takes a situation than we've all seen many times in movies about heterosexuals and switches it to the gay life. The nice thing is it shows that this is normal everyday life for anyone; gay or straight.   Anyone could see this and love it gay or straight if they just watch it for what it is.  This is not (in my opinion) a gay movie; it is a movie about they everyday life of anyone who's out there looking for love.  The film maker simply showed that everyday life includes gays as well.  Sure it centered around a gay man but it DID NOT center around gay life.  It centered around LIFE.  Period!  )  I'm pleased with this film on many levels but the fact that it shows that everyone goes through the same thing and has the same feelings regardless of whether they are gay or straight is my favorite thing about this film.  I highly recommend this film for everyone to see.  ) ","genre":null},{"date":"17 October 1998","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  This movie is excellent.
