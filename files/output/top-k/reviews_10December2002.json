An assassin is someone who kills people for aliving. This is not a nice, responsible adult. Portraying him as a supportive caregiver is insane. Why would he ever take in a 12 year old girl?

This guy kills people but he's got a problem with cigarettes.I also like the cliched portrayal of his two-faced boss.

I kind of doubt it. His outbursts have to be bad for p.r. And then we come to Natalie Portman's character. A 12 year old orphan thinks it'd be a good idea to move in with an assassin? I guess her parents never told her not to talk to strangers. And then she's going to become an assassin? If your parents had just gotten killed by people you don't even know, would you want to move in with an assassin and become one? Doesn't she have relatives? This film is completely ridiculous.

Edward is handsome, caring and has a thriving business. His family is perfect. His wife Connie is a beautiful woman, good mother and loving wife. At least that is how things seem on the surface. Adrian Lyne's remake of Claude Charbrol's La Femme Infidele shows the shattering consequences of Connie's adulterous affair with a handsome, young Frenchman named Paul Martel. Adrian Lyne is known for his sexually charged thrillers Fatal Attraction 9 1\/2 Weeks and Indecent Proposal. Unfaithful is superior to those films due to the characters written by Alvin Sargent and William Broyles Jr. and wonderfully brought to life by the three lead actors. Mr. Lyne's debut film Foxes (1980) showed that he was able to deliver a well done, character driven movie. In Unfaithful, Mr. Lyne directs with a subtlety and maturity that he has never shown before. Connie Sumner is shopping in New York during a particularly blustery day. The wind blows her into the arms of Paul Martel and the couple crashes to the sidewalk. Paul invites Connie up to his loft to clean her scraps and call her a cab. He gives her a book to remember the day. Connie finds herself attracted to the young man. She returns to Paul's apartment a few days later under the ruse of thanking him for his help. Third time's the charm. Connie returns again, unable to fight her attraction for the young man who knows all the right words to say.  What follows is a torrid passionate affair. I enjoyed the fact that director Lyne didn't have Connie and Paul fall into bed on the first day. Connie seems to have everything she could want. She takes her time and weighs the risks at first. She's only flesh and blood and lust wins out. Connie indulges her mid-life crisis. Lyne doesn't give the audience a pat reason for her actions. Like the best films of the 70s, Unfaithful respects the audience's intelligence by not drawing us an overly detailed map of Connie's heart. Reality soon crashes down on the heads of the clandestine lovers. Edward begins to suspect something is amiss. The final shot is both ambiguous and satisfactory. Very haunting! Unfaithful is a morality tale that doesn't preach from the pulpit. Rather, the film takes an objective view of the characters and lets the audience reach their own conclusions as to how they will apply its lessons to their lives. This is a fine piece of adult filmmaking which is, along with Jacob's Ladder, the best film Mr. Lyne has directed. The lion's share of the film's success must be given to the magnificent Diane Lane. She is guaranteed to be nominated for an Oscar for this role. It is nice to she her finally cast in a high-profile film which showcases her vast talent as an actress, rather than the co-star or supporting parts she usually gets. As Connie rides the train back to the suburbs after her first sexual encounter with Paul, she thinks back on the afternoon. She smiles, she cries, she laughs, she worries. Intercut with this scene are flashbacks of the lovemaking. Ms. Lane is a wonder to watch during this scene, as she is during the entire film! This is her movie. That is saying a lot as Mr. Gere and Martinez are also excellent. Richard Gere delivers a very introspective performance as the cuckolded Edward Sumner. I was reminded of Donald Sutherland's excellent low-key performance in Ordinary People. This is the type of performance which is never recognized by the Academy, but which, nevertheless, anchors the film and gives it greater depth. Edward is clueless to the fact that his wife would even consider having an affair. Lyne bravely showed the couple being intimate twice in the film. Connie and Edward are making love. Connie obviously loves her husband, but she has an itch that Edward can't reach. Mr. Gere's performance is largely internal. He delivers more with a simple look than most other actors could with several pages of dialogue. Having said that, he is acted off the screen by Lane who is simply on fire in this film. Oliver Martinez is also quite good as Paul. He isn't pushy. He sends out his vibe to Connie. Like an experienced fly-fisherman, Paul is a patient seducer. He and Ms. Lane have great on-screen chemistry together. Though we know the affair will have to end, we envy their small hours of passion. This is great filmmaking which can make the viewer escape into the affair as it happens, but then fret and worry about the marriage when the lovers are apart. This film shows a maturity as a filmmaker that Mr. Lyne has only hinted at before. Let's hope that this is a new beginning for him. Let's also hope that Ms. Lane will finally be recognized for more than her ample and natural beauty. A stunning film with the best performance of the year in Diane Lane's stunning portrayal.

I don't think the filmmakers fully exploited this concept, and fell into the rut of typical filmmaking anyway.  At least it has the premise.  Possible Spoilers below One of my gripes with any sequel continuation is the episodal nature of the films.  Most TV episodes begin and end with nothing really changing--you still have the same characters in a similar position, and every now and then the show gets ambitious and changes their relation to each other.  Only when an actor leaves does something dramatic happen.  Same can be said of film sequels, and if they do try to do something dramatic within the film they find a way to hit the reset button.Look at the Batman films--Kim Basinger's role could have been reprised, but no.  Michelle Pfiefer, Nicole Kidman, same story.  Batman, the character, and his relations to everyone around him never really change throughout the films.  In Batman & Robin the butler may die--yeah right, like any writer has the balls to make a permanent change to the existing Batman world on celluloid.  By the end of the film, everything is pretty much the same except for the inevitable team up of Robin and Batgirl.  The comics have more ambition than the films--at least they had the guts to originally add those characters.  That's not to say the comics can let a character stay dead . . .  In Blade, Whistler dies.  In Blade II, they bring him right back.  It'd be nice if in life we could just push a reset button and have things fixed like that.  In this one, Blade starts to develop a sympathy for a certain vampiric vixon, but what happens?  She wasn't around at the beginning of the film, so consider her already gone.  Blade's new assistant, what's his name?  Is he part of the typical Blade world?  No.  Guess who he's really working for?  Blade II has a writer who's too timid around the character to properly explore Blade enough to make permanent changes to his environment.  As a result, you can predict this entire freakin' film based on the Blade character.  You don't even have to see any of the film's footage to predict who dies and lives.  It wouldn't be so bad, but every film with this nature is -exactly- the same way.  So, why exactly are we going to see a film set where nothing really happens across all of its sequels?Blade II ruins Whistler's death scene, it doesn't pack the punch it should because oh, he comes back.  The people who whined that he died in Blade 1 can watch the part of the film where he's alive, or maybe read the same comic books over and over.  Why spend money on something new when there's nothing really new in it?  I don't get that.  I want to see a sequel who is bold enough to actually make changes to the Blade concept, to the characters, introduce new characters and keep them or kill them off and leave them buried.  I'd be very pleasantly shocked to see someone make a film ballsy enough to kill off Blade in the end, as much as I like the character--I'm so itching for some one to do something dramatic with a franchise like this, I would welcome that.  But hey, that's not going to happen.  Too many people would whine because someone has more ambition than they do.   Other things that annoyed me with this film--the villains all looked alike.

It's like they're trying to replace flesh and blood actors altogether. It's still gonna take them a while, because as impressive as this movie looks, it's still nowhere near as realistic as live action. I cringed every time I noticed a character wasn't moving properly. What we need is a happy medium in CG animated films. Something that isn't trying to be ultra-realistic, but also something more mature than say, Pixar's stuff (I'm seriously getting sick of all that cutesy CG animation).Besides the animation, Alec Baldwin's character is a flat stereotype, James Woods' motivation isn't explored enough, and the plot is confusing at times, not to mention hokey as all get out, crammed with corny new-age spiritualism. And other than the name Cid, it bears absolutely no resemblence to any of the Final Fantasy games. Everything that makes those games great is missing from this. How can they even call it Final Fantasy?Nice job Square. 4\/10.

More than the confrontation between two generations separated by honor and truth - The movie is a look at the relationship between parents and children.  It was nice to see Tom Hanks and Paul Newman together because they're both good actors. This movie takes place in Chicago, 1931, and is narrated by a 12-year-old boy who finds out that the true work of his father, Michael Sullivan, is a mob hitman. Orphaned and poor, Sullivan is sheltered by Rooney, the head of the mob, as if he were another of his children. But it is Rooney's true son, Conner, who becomes a bloody beast; he is the one who unleashes one of the most dangerous scenes in the film.As a father, despite his work, he struggles until the end to make his son happy and not follow his steps, because he wants the best for him. While the movie may be slow-paced; it still has some unforgettable characters like the  psychopathic photographer (played by Jude Law) who is hired to find and kill Tom Hanks.   When you hear a plot like the one for this film, it can be easy for a person to guess the ending. The ending was a disappointment, and I was expecting something more from it. Overall, it's not a bad movie and it can be very enjoyable, but the predictability of the story may ruin the experience. 6\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"10 December 2002","score":"","review":"  Spoilers Road to perdition is a portrait of a killing.

He wants his son to remember him so he begins to videotape himself talking to his unborn son and teaching him things about life. He also learns to come to terms with his anger, mostly towards his family and past which he has coldly tried to block out. Michael Keaton and Nicole Kidman give excellent performances as the couple expecting. The movie has a wonderful message...'Life is too short to be angry all the time' More girls like this movie than guys as far as I know, but guys don't shun it. 'My Life' will move you if you open up. I can honestly say this (along with Deerhunter) came as close to making me cry as humanly possible. But I internally held my sorrow and further reinforced the societal masculine standard of 'boys don't cry' unfortunately. There are a few scenes in particular that are tough to watch with a dry eye. The ending of course, and the part where Keaton and Kidman share an unexpected hug while in a busy theme park. This is a well done scene with nice complimentary music that sets the tone. The entire movie does this. It plays with our emotions by using deep music and meaningful messages. We should all identify with Keaton's character who learns a lot about life as it comes to an end. This is a 7 out of 10 in my book.
