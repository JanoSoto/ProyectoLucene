[{"date":"8 November 2012","score":"","review":" That pretty much sums up Scream 3. The movie tries to be hip and cool like the first two but unfortunately falls victim to the very thing that it was spoofing; the longer horror franchises run the more silly they become. With that said, that doesn't mean Scream 3 isn't entertaining; its just that its entertaining for all the wrong reasons. In this movie, all of the characters have now become celebrities, but lo and behold another Ghostface is on the loose and looking for Sidney Prescott, who's now living in fear and seclusion while working at home as a crisis counselor for women. But she won't be in seclusion for long, as we soon find out that Ghostface is stalking and killing her friends and cast members of the new Stab 3, the movie within a movie spoof, in order to draw her out. The problem is that Scream 3 just doesn't feel like a Scream movie and the reason why is quite simple; Kevin Williamson did not write it and it clearly shows on screen. Some of the issues include the fact that the killer can use his voice changer to sound like any one of the characters sounds kind of cool at first but one has to ask how that would be possible, Ghostface using untraditional ways of killing people such as cutting gas lines and blowing up a house, and the problem of Ghostface just not being scary anymore. In the first two movies, Ghostface was human in the sense that people could knock him down and hit him but yet he still managed come across as scary. In this movie, Ghostface gets beat up so much that I can't help but wonder if this is where Scary Movie got some of the ideas for its jokes. It gets even more hilarious when you learn the identity of the killer, who I will not reveal here, and you're not even sure who he is when he first pulls the mask off because he was such a minor character. If that's not enough the writer, Ehren Kruger, tries to sell us the idea that it was this killer who coached the Ghostface from the first movie on how to kill and even provided him the motivation. Anyone who's seen and loves the first movie should know that's a bunch of bull. Just try not to laugh at all of this and the last part of the movie where Sidney and the killer are beating the living crap out of each other but yet none of them have any bruises to show for it. Bottom line is this Scream is not a movie you should watch for good horror entertainment. Rather, this is a movie you should watch for a good laugh with friends. 7 out of 10.

However, that did not stop me from watching this film many times during my life. Ever since I was little, this was my favorite Disney movie. This is an excellent film. It teaches great morals, and executes them very well. The story is about Aladdin falling in love with Princess Jasmine, but finds out she can only marry a prince, due to the law. He acquires a lamp with the Genie inside, and he wishes to become a prince, or should I say, look like one. This is my only problem with the film, but this can be overlooked. Why can't he wish he WAS a prince instead of looking like one? But it moves very well into the moral, so I can excuse this. After finding out he would become Sultan after marrying Jasmine, he decides to try and tell her the truth that he's not actually a prince. It's actually before the villain fight and not at the exact end where we have a moral. I like that. He learns that he needs to be truthful, and was trying to tell Jasmine before Jafar exposes him for who he really is. He also learns to keep promises. Before his first wish with the Genie, he promises him he would use his 3rd wish to free him, and even at the end, the Genie tries to talk him into wishing into a prince again, but Aladdin still frees him, despite unlikely being able to marry Jasmine. Nice guy. That is a fantastic way of telling your morals.Not only are the morals amazing, but so are the characters, especially Aladdin himself. He starts off as a homeless person on the streets of Agrabah, but he has very impressive smarts. Not only for thievery, but anything in general. I mainly say this because when he defeats Jafar, he says that the Genie has more power than he does, and he can take away his powers. This convinces Jafar to use his third wish to become a genie himself, but gets stuck in his own lamp. I love this guy. He is the textbook definition of genius.Speaking of smart characters, we also have Jasmine. Her father, the sultan of Agrabah, is trying to rush her into getting married, and tries to bring in many princes to marry her. She hates every single one of them. She doesn't care about the law. If she is to marry, she wants it to be for love. She won't marry anyone. She has to actually care for them. I wouldn't marry someone who attempts to whip little kids either. She also nearly figures out Aladdin not being a prince after the Whole New World song, and Aladdin figures out a good excuse. She's another smart and enjoyable character. I also think she's very hot, but I digress.The most important part of this love story is that the two have great chemistry. They have things in common, and want to help each other out. Not only that, but when Aladdin is Prince Ali, Jasmine actually hates him at first. However, Aladdin builds up the relationship again, and gets Jasmine to fall in love with him again. This may not be on quite the level Beauty and the Beast was with building up a relationship, but it works fine here. Jasmine does suspect that it's actually Aladdin and not a prince before the carpet ride, and she already cared for him, so this is not rushed. It does well for its own love story, but the film is not just that. It's also an adventure, especially since Jafar tries to kill Aladdin a lot. He tries to in the Cave of Wonders when Aladdin is hanging off a cliff and he gets the lamp, he tries to when Aladdin is with Jasmine, and he does after he becomes a sorcerer, along with after Aladdin returns to the palace.In conclusion, the film has many things to like about it. It has many great elements in it, and focuses on them in a very coherent manner. It has a great love story, great adventure, great characters, amazing comic relief, and wonderful animation and colors. This is something you can truly call a masterpiece.

Advertised massively all around the world was Tim Burton's Batman. The whole world was experiencing grand scale anxiety attacks. Everyone everywhere had the itch; the itch to see Batman. I was one of them. When the movie finally was about to grace itself on the eager public I personally shelled out some serious money to be one of the first to view it. It was truly going to be an unforgettable experience. I stood in a line that wrapped around a twelve screen theater six times. I knew that it was gonna be good. Michael Keaton, Jack Nicholson and Kim Basinger was plastered on absolutely every magazine, poster, trailers, t.v. spots, talk show interviews, you name it, they were on it.The theater seated 300 people. Every seat was filled with people from all walks of life, different nationalities, all shapes and sizes young an old alike literally screaming for the film to start. Nobody wanted to see any previews...just strictly BATMAN!This was what they seen and what their reaction was. At the beginning Batman introduces himself to two thugs and the audience by saying who he is and raising his arms up to show off his Batwings under his arms and kicks a thug through a door. This is so scary that the one thug is in extreme shock (nobody in the audience responded at all).Later on the audience meets Bruce Wayne as do the characters and Bruce's fancy artwork and other expensive collectibles is discussed inside his mansion (the audience shows no interest in these scenes).At another point we meet the Joker who is learning that The Joker is him since he keeps flipping a Joker in a deck of cards (the audience is quiet).At a factory where the Joker is conceived we see Batman kick a gun from a thug's hand and he also punches a thug from behind (the audience is waiting.....for something).Back at the mansion Bruce Wayne and Vicki Vale are dining at a ridiculously long dining table. They are sitting at each end and Vicki says, Can you pass the salt?. She has to yell because the distance makes it hard to hear. (the audience isn't laughing).There is a sequence at an art gallery where the Joker and his thugs are vandalizing fancy art with paint. (the audience is disgusted).These scenes and many more lead up to a grand finale between Batman and the Joker. (the audience has stuck it out to this point thinking that Tim Burton saved the best for last, they figured they were being teased). Suddenly the audience sees the Batplane and the music is building up. The Batplane rises up through the clouds and blocks out the moon, which of course is a reference to the Bat searchlight. (the audience now is screaming). The Batplane does a nose dive and Batman clicks every switch, turns knobs, lines up his targeting device and makes a B line for the Joker (the audience is awaiting some incredible action). Batman's targeting device is top of the line, zeroed in on the Joker. Batman fires and the stream of bullets blast on both sides of the Joker. (the audience cheering has now dropped down 50 percent....he missed?!). The Joker pulls out a small gun with a long nose (the audience knows that the Joker's gun is no match for such a pristinely built machine like the Batplane). The Joker shoots one bullet, the Batplane is crippled and starts to fall. It crashes and comes to rest on some building steps (the audience is now so stunned that they simply don't understand what they just seen, they all have a look of puzzlement on their faces, they're completely silent).When the ending credits started to roll, nobody applauded and nobody was saying a word.As I stated earlier the theater consisted of all different kinds of people and none of them liked it. Yet every time someone who seen it was asked how good it was by someone who had not seen it they would brag about how brilliant it was. They would, for whatever reason, lie about it. They would go as far as saying that it was one of the best movies they had ever seen. If not one person out of 300 unique individuals liked it then obviously it truly sucked. And still to this very day people go right on lying about it. I'll bet that if you were to go over to a home of one who praises it and tell them that you want to watch it if they have it and actually stick it in and play it that person would suddenly have some dishes to wash; they would need to mow their lawn; run some errands.This film goes beyond being overrated. It has no good points at all and everybody knows it. Nobody will admit that Tim Burton played a practical joke on the world by making this intentionally boring superhero film. And he did it with a pathetic smile on his face. The public fell for his joke so hard that they pretended that they liked it, and they're still pretending.This film should win a special award for the number one most publicly exaggerated film in history.I would like to thank Christopher Nolan for the three Batman films he blessed us with.

I really forgot how good this one was. If i had to rank the 23 films in order of preference, License to Kill would certainly be up there (my favourites being goldenye, goldfinger, thunderball, and of course From Russia With Love) but this probably comes next.My dad really hates Dalton as Bond and believes he overacts in the role that requires the guy to simply 'be cool'. I agree to a certain extent Dalton does throw more emotion into Bond here, but i'd say its warranted; his closest friend has just been amputated by a shark while his wife killed on her wedding day. Reference to Bond being married is made early in the film and no doubt seeing the parallel fates of Felix's wife killed on her wedding day, and that of Bond's own wife shot on her wedding day, would evoke emotion from even the sternest of characters. So basically what I'm saying is, yes Dalton acts a lot more than the others, but with good reason in this film.At times early on this felt like an 80's cop film to be honest, with the plot embroiled in narcotics and a plain and simple drug lord as the villain. Sanchez is a great villain because whenever Bond is around him under the alias of a hit-man, you genuinely fear for Bond. You never got the sense of danger with Roger; raise an eyebrow and retort a cheesy line in the face of danger and he's out of trouble. Like i said the plot involving a drug lord seems very grounded considering what Bond had brought us before this, but thats a pro rather than con. It was just getting silly at times during Rogers tenure (through no fault of his own might i add, in case you think I'm hating on Roger) and Dalton brought things back down to earth a little.One thing that bugged me, the canoodeling (yes i said canoodeling) in the boat following the bar brawl. Bond's literally just met this person yet their getting it on. But you know, Bond is often cluttered with surrealism so a little here doesn't damage it too much i suppose. 8 out of 10 for me.

Black Hawk Down really showed brotherly love, which symbolizes how military squads can be like family. My favorite thing about the movie was the intense close ups of each solider and each weapon, plus all of the dramatic battle shots. One last thing that was my favorite about the movie would have to be, including the actor Ewan McGregor. The reason is he appeared as Obi Wan Kenobi in the Star Wars films from episode 1-3.Evidently, the movie was a total success.With two Oscars, two Academy awards and twenty-nine nominations this movie exploded in theaters everywhere. The quote We leave no man behind out stood the movie and had a symbolic message. The story talks about a young man who wishes to be recruited by the army, this young man's name is Grimes. Every man goes into the army full of pride and thinks that this will become the best adventure in his life, sadly it turned out to be total chaos. Every solider in the movie was determined to rescue the injured pilots no matter what.Every close up shot of each solider showed real fear, a fighting spirit and determination. This kind of spirit keeps solders energized and ready to fight again tomorrow and without it then where is the purpose of putting your life endanger if there is no fighting spirit and some one who appreciates your hard work. Each solder has a purpose on the battlefield which includes watching each others back and sometimes having to make the hard choice of rather letting you take the bullet rather then your comrade.The battle shots sometimes take me into the actual movie. The movie shows that it can be me fighting a war somewhere in the future. You never think that you have it hard until you see this movie or you read something about a conflict happening somewhere around the world. Directors have the great opportunity to bring film making to the next level which is fantastic. Steven Spielberg did an amazing job on this film, he even brought a war that I didn't even though And made it fantastic and unforgettable.Even though this movie was one of my favorite I do wish that there could have been for story and a heroic conclusion. Most movies that I have seen either end in great conclusion or they continue in another movie. This movie left me puzzled. I did intend to see a comeback from the United States military but sadly there was nothing. Nevertheless this move was fantastic, this movie is recommended for people who love brotherhood within movies, determination and those who have a fighting spirit.

I had been putting it off for a while because it didn't really take my fancy... but last night I decided to watch it.The movie is about a man who has been imprisoned on an island called Devil's Island and his numerous bids to escape.It stars Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman... I have only seen a couple of Steve McQueen's films but I have to say he has been brilliant in them all. I will be looking out for more of his movies. Steve plays Papillon... and he plays it well. The stress and health problem his character goes through in this movie was horrible and believable to watch. At one point Papillon looked so ill that he nearly died. He actually looked really bad. He goes through such a rough time trying to escape but never gives up. He meets someone there who he gets close to and they try and escape together. Dustin Hoffman plays his friend really well too. I am not a big Dustin Hoffman fan, but this is one of his best films that I have seen.The film is on for just under 2 and a half hours, which is very long... but to be honest it didn't feel like it. It didn't drag out and I didn't get restless during the movie.I tried not to compare this to Steves other famous escape film, but I couldn't help it before watching it... but they are 2 completely different movies. If you have not seen this, do not compare them because they are not the same. I didn't like this film as much as the Great Escape though, but it was still very enjoyable.The only mistake I saw whilst watching it was when Papillon was sitting on a makeshift raft floating in the sea and you could actually see someone swimming underneath his raft holding it to make sure it didn't move too much. I mean it really was very obvious, I noticed it straight away... but don't get me wrong. That just amused me and didn't ruin the movie.I will give this film 7 out of 10...

I mean it really was very obvious, I noticed it straight away... but don't get me wrong. That just amused me and didn't ruin the movie.I will give this film 7 out of 10... A really good movie, and definitely worth a watch.for more reviews check out my Facebook pagehttp\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews\/456572047728204?ref=hl ","genre":"Biography, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"8 November 2012","score":"1 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" This is an absolute, heart wrenchingly wonderful movie. I am American. And yes this movie tugs at my heart strings. I have watched reviews like this for years without ever saying a word... But now is my time. Mainly aimed towards movies such as Braveheart and this, these reviews often disgruntle if not disgust me. Though I see a common pattern. Each review that bothers me is the product of one of some British loser bitter in his nature. Let's get something straight. This movie as well as Braveheart were not mean to be historical teachings. It has never once been claimed that the events in these movie are historical facts. This is not a history lesson you stupid British. This is Hollywood California. These movies were made to appeal to the masses who provide the main income for those involved in the making. And guess what, that main source of income, the masses thereof, come From the United States of America. Because guess what? That's where the money is. True that in this film the British are made out as the bad guys because guess what, the majority of viewers of this film call themselves Americans. So forgive us please for creating a fictional Hollywood film portraying our country as the good guys. But as I said that is Hollywood. The movie was created in this way to appeal to the emotions of our people. And all factual evidence shows that some Of your countrymen were very inappropriate in their handling of certain situations in this war. And so were ours. But we as Americans aren't here to whine about it. If Britain were to create such a fabulous movie portraying us as the bad guys we would probably clap our hands and enjoy it because we have the courage to respect your viewpoint and enjoy the movie. We know that it is not real. We as Americans realize the flaws of our ancestors as well as yours. This is a movie. A fictional Tale for our entertainment. And yes it makes us feel good about our history because.... that's right... Our rebellious, cocky ancestors whooped your British butts in the revolutionary war. And you can talk all the smack you want but, we are still the victor! Most of our states are larger than your entire country and we have 50! Get it Brits? We don't care about historical accuracy in our Hollywood films! It is meant for entertainment! We know you aren't all that bad! It's just a story! And the film even portrays most British officers protesting certain Actions of the bad general. This is not far from Historically accurate. There are always good and bad guys on Both sides of the coin. And last of all, remember this... We are still allies you idiotic redcoats! We fight and bleed together. If it wasn't for the support of the USA your tiny country would not hardly matter in the entire scope of things so show us some respect. So yes maybe some of our movies make you feel bad about your culture, but we do not look at these movies as fact. We know that they are only entertainment meant to inspire our American pride. Get your heads out of your tails and do the same. Try to remember we ARE allies now. We beat you, but now we are friends. Hollywood is just entertainment. Get over it. We will protect you when your puny tails are attacked. This movie is amazing from every logical aspect. 10 out of 10. Forget your national pride and watch this movie as an unbiased viewer.

I myself before seeing this for the first time (RD was my very first Tarantino film ) did not like to sit through films that were heavy in dialogue as i found them immensely boring. That changed and was only cemented after also viewing his Pulp Fiction (Another character\/dialogue enriched film).For those who have yet to see this cinematic masterpiece let me fill you in a bit. 7 men all hired by crime thief expert Joe Cabot to perform a job on a jewelry store that has according to sources a load of diamonds that just came in from Brazil, after the job goes very badly the men who survived the aftermath shootout with the police were to show up at the rendezvous point. We get three of the men Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) pulling a badly injured Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) who had taken a bullet to his belly who are at the rendezvous point first and let the dialogue roll... All of the men seem to believe that the heist was a setup but have to unfortunately stay put until the arrival of Joe Cabot to tell them further instructions.Kudos here to Michael Madsen who portrays, most excellently the psychotic Mr. Blonde aka Vic Vega who was definitely my favourite character in the film.

And for that reason. It's not realism. Nor does it try to be. On the contrary the surreal is celebrated here. You need only watch the scene involving Butch's selection of weapons in a standard corner store (a hammer, a chainsaw, a samurai sword) to realise Tarantino's playful homage to some of his favourite genres isn't halted by a reductive realist approach.While the narrative is a little disorientating on times, the beauty of it is that the audience become involved in the film more-so; it's their task to piece everything together. An interactive movie if you will. Tarantino being a film buff clutters his film with homage to some of his favourites. The dancing sequence involving Travolta evokes such nostalgia among movie fans for his roles in Greace and Saturday Night Fever, though is originally a nod to Jean Luc Godard for his approach of just stopping the film in full flow for a musical sequence. The briefcase with the light inside echos that of Kiss Me Deadly; a classical noir while Walkens tale regarding the watch mirrors the character from The Deer Hunter who was captured in Vietnam.On to performance. Travolta an unlikely choice at the time people forget does wonderfully well as our on screen stand in. He's constantly behind what's happening (the motif of events changing dramatically with every visit Vincent makes to the toilet is one often mentioned)and plays catch up alongside us since the narrative is so ridiculously spontaneous spinning off in unexpected directions(who on earth would have seen a rape scene ensue from Butch and Marcellus storyline, or Mias unexpected O.D- that wasn't on the cards was it). Jackson is the man as always playing Mr Cool here perfectly and Willis already a household name by this point brings credibility to the film, all the same his segment of the film is my least favourite. Possibly because of the playful immature banter between the two supposedly professional hit-man is just too funny. I just love the fact that in Tarantinos world, two dangerous murderers are brought down to bickering school children, scared to death of the thought of Jimmys wife arriving home. Not of the police, but of Jimmys wife. Surreal, but thats the beauty of this film. Simply has to be watched. One of the best films you'll see.

You have to watch it but thats all he asks. And if you do you'll become embroiled with the most self reflexive film around. Cluttered with inter textual references to pop culture e.g pilots,Marilyn Monroe,Fonzie etc Tarantinos sublimely definitive post modern film highlights its artifice and as such we are suckered in.While the prudish may squirm at a 'immature celebration of violence' I personally applaud the profound approach of Tarantino presenting us with such outlandishly gruesome violence (pieces of brain etc) that we can do nothing but laugh. And for that reason. It's not realism. Nor does it try to be. On the contrary the surreal is celebrated here. You need only watch the scene involving Butch's selection of weapons in a standard corner store (a hammer, a chainsaw, a samurai sword) to realise Tarantino's playful homage to some of his favourite genres isn't halted by a reductive realist approach.While the narrative is a little disorientating on times, the beauty of it is that the audience become involved in the film more-so; it's their task to piece everything together. An interactive movie if you will. Tarantino being a film buff clutters his film with homage to some of his favourites. The dancing sequence involving Travolta evokes such nostalgia among movie fans for his roles in Greace and Saturday Night Fever, though is originally a nod to Jean Luc Godard for his approach of just stopping the film in full flow for a musical sequence. The briefcase with the light inside echos that of Kiss Me Deadly; a classical noir while Walkens tale regarding the watch mirrors the character from The Deer Hunter who was captured in Vietnam.On to performance. Travolta an unlikely choice at the time people forget does wonderfully well as our on screen stand in. He's constantly behind what's happening (the motif of events changing dramatically with every visit Vincent makes to the toilet is one often mentioned)and plays catch up alongside us since the narrative is so ridiculously spontaneous spinning off in unexpected directions(who on earth would have seen a rape scene ensue from Butch and Marcellus storyline, or Mias unexpected O.D- that wasn't on the cards was it). Jackson is the man as always playing Mr Cool here perfectly and Willis already a household name by this point brings credibility to the film, all the same his segment of the film is my least favourite. Possibly because of the playful immature banter between the two supposedly professional hit-man is just too funny. I just love the fact that in Tarantinos world, two dangerous murderers are brought down to bickering school children, scared to death of the thought of Jimmys wife arriving home. Not of the police, but of Jimmys wife. Surreal, but thats the beauty of this film. Simply has to be watched. One of the best films you'll see. I love Inglorious Basterds but i cant decide whether it tops Pulp Fiction. Either way both are amazing. Watch this film.

Along with Blue Underground, these guys are pretty much Criterion for fans of horror and exploitation, with movies like Thriller A Cruel Picture, Frankenhooker and Maniac Cop under their belt. So it makes perfect sense that they would release the vigilante movie favorite The Exterminator on a Blu-Ray\/DVD combo pack. This is a mixed bag for me, as I don't have a Blu-Ray player, but I do have a DVD player, so I can watch the movie but not judge the two discs. I can however, judge the movie.John Eastland (Robert Ginty) is a Vietnam vet whose war buddy and long time best friend Michael Jefferson (Steve James.) When Michael is fatally wounded by thugs, Eastland decides that not only those responsible should pay the pimps, pushers and filth of the streets must be exterminated. Thing is, this is bad for the mayor, whose got an election coming up, so it's up to Detective James Dalton (Christopher George) to stop the man known to the city of New York as The Exterminator. While there are flaws in this movie (the relationship between Dalton and a nurse played by Samantha Eggar feels unnecessary), this is a prime example of early 80's exploitation. While gore-hounds will be let down (only a gnarly decapitation in a Vietnam flashback), the violence here is vicious and unrelenting-in fact, largely skimping on splatter actually helps enhance the brutality on display-and boy is it a vicious little movie. Eastland is not a man who plays around, setting people ablaze, dropping them in meat-grinders, shooting them with mercury laced bullets-he means business. Also, exploitation fans will more than likely enjoy this, as this is the type of movie that shows you New York before it was cleaned up. This is a world of drug pushers, murderers, and more-the scum of the Earth, and The Exterminator has had enough of them.It also helps that this is a well directed and mostly well acted movie. James Glickenhouse* films the whole thing in a matter of fact style-no flashy editing or tricks here, just the worst the city has to offer and ugly violence pushed into your face, which aids the already gritty tone of the movie. Meanwhile, Ginty (who most may remember from the MST3K movie Warriors of the Lost World) has a kind of Charles Bronson like quality-not as good of an actor, but he doesn't really look like an action star. He just looks like a regular guy, and the actor thankfully manages to make Eastland human but not too sympathetic. If anything, he's a psychopath. George meanwhile, plays the guy who may be the most likable character. He doesn't want The Exterminator killing people, but he understands why he's doing it, and doesn't seem to care much for the corrupt political and police establishment around him.For fans of revenge movies and exploitation, The Exterminator is something that must be seen. Is it a perfect movie? No, but it get's the job done without any added bulls#!t.*Glickenhouse also wrote this movie, and directed the Christopher Walken action movie McBain, Jackie Chan's ill-advised U.S. debut The Protector and the Peter Weller\/Sam Elliot cop movie Shakedown. He also produced Basket Case 2, Frankenhooker, Maniac Cop and the Joe Don Baker vehicle Ring of Steel.

If you are going to compare Pocahontas to any of those masterpieces, the film is horrendous. But as a film on its own, it's not terrible, even though I am not fond of it.My biggest complaint about the film is that it's basically a re-telling of how the new land was founded, even though they made most of it up. Come on, we've heard this story many times. But they do also want to connect us with nature, and animals. Colors of the Wind is a good example of this but I'll get to the songs in just a minute. I find it ironic that the story wants to connect with nature, but animals can't talk. I have one more question about that, however. How come the animals can't talk, but the tree Pocahontas talks to can? I don't get it.Speaking of her, she's not very interesting, and neither is John Smith. I find that odd because Mel Gibson voices him. In addition to my other complaints, I do not like Governor Ratcliffe. Is he even supposed to be the villain everyone claims he is? To me, he's just some gold-obsessed person who thinks the Indians are evil. Jafar I consider a villain. Maleificant is another I believe to truly be evil. Ratcliffe, on the other hand, is just some guy who wants gold and has decent military skills.Anyway, I have one more complaint, and then I will talk about the good stuff. Why are all the Indians copper skinned, and all the British folk have white skin? I know this is a kids film, but no racism! Anyway, I love the songs in this film, especially Savages and Colors Of The Wind. I know Alan Menken, the same guy who did songs for Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and The Little Mermaid made these songs, but I honestly feel this is some of his best work. And speaking of colors, this film has an excellent design and very colorful imagery. The characters and backgrounds look amazing. I also love the raccoon that accompanies Pocahontas. This guy is very funny. I love how he's basically a bully to the spoiled dog.
