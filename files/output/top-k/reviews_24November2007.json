Rarely have I seen a film so willing to show this kind of violence (but don't get me wrong, they don't go overboard with it).Brian (David Duchovny) and Carrie (Michelle Forbes) play a couple who decide to go on a road trip to see famous murder sites, and they want people to accompany them. So, white trash couple Earley (Brad Pitt) and Adele (Juliette Lewis) join up with them. But as it turns out, Earley doesn't give a second thought about killing people. He's like Alex the Droog in the sense of almost taking pleasure in committing the most vicious acts. And when they take up in the house of a nuclear physicist, everything takes a turn for the ugliest.Though Earley one of the nastiest individuals whom you could ever imagine, you can't help but admire something about him. Maybe how he always knows how to take control of a situation (albeit through coercion). Truth be told, Brian comes across as a wimp. Meanwhile, the women seem more like conduits for the plot.But overall, I really liked the movie. Granted, this is not one for the fainthearted (unless the fainthearted in question are masochists). Otherwise, I recommend it.

In fact, I just watched it for the first time eight years after its release. Since the IMDb rating is 4.1\/10, it's obvious that this 1999 blockbuster isn't very popular, and after watching it myself, while it clearly wasn't as bad an experience for me as it was for certain other nay-sayers, I am not left wondering why.A former Civil War hero named Capt. Jim West meets a U.S. Marshal named Artemus Gordon while attempting to kill General Bloodbath McGrath. At the White House, the two meet President Ulysses S. Grant, who sends them both on a mission together to stop Dr. Arliss Loveless, an evil inventor who is a threat to the United States of America, and has recently abducted many great scientists! Unfortunately for West and Gordon, this mission will be made more difficult by a number of things, including some of Loveless' clever, life-threatening inventions! If you ask me, Wild Wild West does have some reasonable action sequences, and I definitely did occasionally find myself in mild suspense, but overall, it fails as an action movie, as most of it doesn't work, and is just plain boring. This 1999 blockbuster also fails miserably as a comedy, with one lame or mediocre gag after another. I did smile a bit, but don't recall ever actually laughing at any point. One gag I can remember off the top of my head is the She's a breath of fresh a#%.\/She's a breast of fresh air one, which definitely counts as a lame gag. Loveless' inventions add a sci-fi touch to this primarily western movie, which gets a tad awkward. Towards the end of the film, it gets even more tiring than before.I have never seen any episodes of The Wild Wild West, the 1960's TV series which this movie is based on, but it seems to be very popular with those who have seen it, unlike this 1999 flop. Without a doubt, this film was a letdown after the successful Men in Black, a film which, just like this one, was directed by Barry Sonnenfeld and features Will Smith in a starring role. Since this movie flopped and the original TV series obviously didn't if it had a movie based on it made thirty years later, I think it's fair to say that whether you've ever seen episodes of the show or not, and whether you like the show or not if you have seen it, it's probably best to skip this movie.

Exploring often gets Ariel into trouble, and she must sneak around on the sly. Ariel is hugely fascinated by the human world - and she secretly visits old shipwrecks and other places, and collects old human possessions. Despite knowing that humans are dangerous, Ariel cannot stop herself, and is enchanted by this different world. She ends up saving the life of a Prince named Eric, after his ship as destroyed by a hurricane as she was watching it.After taking Eric to shore, Ariel sings to him with her beautiful voice. As Eric opens his eyes, Ariel flees, as she does not want to be seen, afraid of scaring him. Ariel falls for Eric, and he too, for her, just by her singing. When King Triton finds out Ariel loves a human, he is furious and forbids her anything to do with him, and smashes all her secret human possessions. Hurt, and very angry, Ariel visits the sea witch Ursula, and exchanges her beautiful voice, in return for human legs. Ursula's magic allows Ariel to be human for 3 days, and if Ariel can make the Prince kiss her before the sun sets on the 3rd day, she will be human forever...I first saw this movie when I was six years old, and it has been my favourite Disney movie ever since. It was my first Disney film, and is still my all time favourite. I grew up singing the songs, talking like Ariel, I craved to be a real mermaid for years! The story, direction, animation, and character portrayal in this movie absolutely amazing - I loved every second. The best part I would have to say, is the music.

Exploring often gets Ariel into trouble, and she must sneak around on the sly. Ariel is hugely fascinated by the human world - and she secretly visits old shipwrecks and other places, and collects old human possessions. Despite knowing that humans are dangerous, Ariel cannot stop herself, and is enchanted by this different world. She ends up saving the life of a Prince named Eric, after his ship as destroyed by a hurricane as she was watching it.After taking Eric to shore, Ariel sings to him with her beautiful voice. As Eric opens his eyes, Ariel flees, as she does not want to be seen, afraid of scaring him. Ariel falls for Eric, and he too, for her, just by her singing. When King Triton finds out Ariel loves a human, he is furious and forbids her anything to do with him, and smashes all her secret human possessions. Hurt, and very angry, Ariel visits the sea witch Ursula, and exchanges her beautiful voice, in return for human legs. Ursula's magic allows Ariel to be human for 3 days, and if Ariel can make the Prince kiss her before the sun sets on the 3rd day, she will be human forever...I first saw this movie when I was six years old, and it has been my favourite Disney movie ever since. It was my first Disney film, and is still my all time favourite. I grew up singing the songs, talking like Ariel, I craved to be a real mermaid for years! The story, direction, animation, and character portrayal in this movie absolutely amazing - I loved every second. The best part I would have to say, is the music.

The original release version was supposedly butchered beyond recognition, but I was frustrated to find this one itself had so many problems, because it is often beautiful. What could've been a masterpiece on The Godfather Part II level misses for reasons I cannot fully understand, and it's sad.It is possible that much of it went over my head, but right now it appears that director Sergio Leone, or his cutter and assembler, unaccountably lost account of or forgot to include crucial narrative information in a way I have never seen happen before in a major production.SPOILERS AHEAD At the beginning, a woman is shot by Burt Young and another thug after going to look for Noodles (Robert DeNiro), who's in hiding from them. A few seconds before she notices some bullet holes on or near Noodles' bed. The bullet holes are never explained, and I think this woman was Noodles' girlfriend seen much later in a 1933 flashback (Darlanne Fluegel?). However, we are never really introduced to her; she just shows up those two times with no back story, and this seems confusing and abrupt. The motivation of Burt Young, et al going after them to begin with was vague; it was obviously because of a rip-off but was not shown or explained coherently. There's some build-up to an ambitious robbery that's supposed to be very dangerous, with much forewarning from Tuesday Weld (who is excellent), but we never see this event come down. Yet Leone spends interminable minutes on a boy toying with a pastry. Also there seems to be some material missing about Treat Williams' union official's relationship with organized crime and how this led to James Woods' plight at the movie's conclusion. Finally, what was the point of not bothering to age the actors? Elizabeth McGovern is supposed to look different from 1933 to 1968, but there was no effort to show 30 plus years of aging. De Niro gets some gray in his hair; that's it. I suppose I'm missing some symbolism. I was very unhappy with the rape scene, not only due to the revolting imagery but also because since there was no prior hint of such potential behavior in the development of the DeNiro character, it was shockingly unexpected.I nod to OUTIA for its breathtaking production design, good cast, good performances and pacing. But for the frustrating lapses, I express puzzlement, unless, as some have suggested, the 1968 portion is all a dream. I'm not used to the way some European directors work, and don't have the time or patience for repeat viewings to tease out all the hidden information here (if it is here at all) as such films require, so I thank other posters for their insights. For now, much of this movie is too abstruse for me.I still like this picture much better than any other Sergio Leone production I've seen, as I have always been alienated by his supposedly ironic but mostly just arch deconstruction of the Western, in which meaningful dialogue, character development, and exposition is ditched in favor of long, enigmatic minutes of actors' faces close-up as they stare at each other, with strangely grandiose, glorious music swelling up in the background. Call me reactionary, but I regard his contribution to the Western genre to be a largely a load of stylistic, self-absorbed poppycock.

Even by today's jaded standards, it still packs a wallop and Robert Mitchum's Max Cady is just as evil, sadistic and threatening as ever. It is as magnificent a portrayal of a thoroughly corrupt, cold-blooded and heartless individual as has been seen in the history of cinema. Cady is out to seek revenge on Sam Bowden, whose testimony was crucial to Cady's spending eight years in prison for assaulting a woman. Bowden is played by Gregory Peck; the two stars provide a wonderful contrast in acting styles, just as their characters are poles apart in their world views. Peck's Bowden is pretty much a straight arrow, a somewhat stiff, by-the-book attorney with a wife and preteen daughter. The brilliant film composer Bernard Hermann adds much to the film's tension with his moody, eerie score which is punctuated by staccato 'stingers' at dramatic points, sounding at times like his work for Hitchcock's 'Psycho.' Cady's initial intimidation (vague comments, menacing looks) are characterized by Bowden as a war of nerves, but that turns out to be wishful thinking. We first realize just how ruthless Cady is when he kills the Bowden's dog by poisoning it. And Cady is not only ruthless, he's smart. He studied law while in prison and is always certain not to get caught doing anything illegal. (Were people really routinely run out of town for vagrancy?) Like Hannibal Lecter, there is an aura of almost superhuman invincibility about him... he never makes mistakes; he disappears like a ghost just before the police arrive. Even three hardened thugs that Bowden hires to rough up Cady are no match for him; he singlehandedly lands all three of them in the hospital. As the film progresses, it becomes clear (as clear as a major studio pic in 1962 can make it) that Max Cady intends to sexually assault Bowden's daughter, Nancy, then force her parents to either drop the charges or have the young girl testify against him in court, which he knows they will never do. This leads Bowden to a desperate plan to trap Cady on a houseboat on the Cape Fear river, lure the ex-convict there and kill him before he realizes his ambition. This is an exciting and uncompromising thriller with some genuinely disturbing undertones. Robert Mitchum set the modern standard for realistically creepy villains that few have matched and none have surpassed since. --------------------------- Additional comment- The article in Wikipedia about 'Cape Fear' makes the ludicrous assertion that Peck and Mitchum are physically mismatched... in Peck's favor!

In the dead of night, our characters stalk through the silent forest, a delicate layer of mist blanketing the ground, the air swathed in fog, the unseen Moon above offering more than enough light for one to easily navigate the labyrinth of trees. It's scenes like this that provide the iconic essence of Universal Picture's horror movies, in addition to the odd Gothic castle in which a lot of the horror unfolds. 'The Wolf Man,' along with 'Frankenstein (1931)' and 'Dracula (1931),' is among the most influential horror movies of all time, having forever altered public conception of the werewolf legend. Much like the numerous versions of 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde' my favourite being the 1920 film with John Barrymore, 'The Wolf Man' deals with the duality of man, and how evil (embodied in the form of a deadly beast) can lurk in the soul of even the kindest gentleman.Lon Chaney, Jr. plays Larry Talbot, who returns to his home town of Llanwelly, Wales after an eighteen year absence. His father, Sir John Talbot (the ever-reliable Claude Rains), is proud to have his only surviving son back home, and hopes that Larry may take control of the respected Talbot estate after his death. Following his return, Larry is drawn towards a beautiful local girl, Gwen Conliffe (Evelyn Ankers), who is already engaged to another young man. However, the story takes a devastating turn when Gwen's friend Jenny (Fay Helm) is attacked and killed by a wolf, and, in the ensuing struggle, Larry kills the creature but is himself wounded. An elderly Gypsy woman (Maria Ouspenskaya) reveals to Larry that he has been bitten by a werewolf, the creature-form of her son Bela (Bela Lugosi), and that he is now doomed to prowl the forest as a wolf when the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright.'The Wolf Man' runs for only 70 minutes, and so the story itself is quite simple and concise, ensuring a fast-moving pace that never lacks in intrigue or excitement. Larry's first transformation into the Wolf Man comes surprisingly late in the film, and I perhaps would have liked more scenes with him as a wolf, though perhaps the arduous process of applying Chaney's make-up (six hours to apply, and three hours to remove) would have proved too much a burden on both the actor and the make-up artist, Jack P. Pierce. It is somewhat peculiar that Lugosi's Bela transforms into a complete wolf, and yet Larry retains his humanoid form, but I've heard at least one reasonable explanation offered it takes many moons before a man can completely become a werewolf at night. Bela, having presumably suffered the affliction for a long time, had long become assimilated into his canine form, but the inexperienced Larry must, in the meantime, settle for a hybrid of both man and wolf. This theory might also explain why Larry, as the Wolf Man, can be seen trying to strangle his victims to death.

Julia Roberts even looks pretty in this film and her legs are lovely.The funniest gags of this film are when Peter Banning says «I'm not that kind of lawyer!»; when Maggie yells «You needed a mother very badly!» to Captain Hook; when Maggie says that Hook «is just a bad man without a mother»; Captain Hook's last words, which ironically are «I want my mommy!»; Hook's fear towards the sounds of clocks; when a miniature of Captain Hook's ship is on fire and sinks; when the pirates yell «Run home, Jack!» by mistake instead of «Home run, Jack!»; Captain Hook's funny attempt to commit suicide, repeatedly forbidding Smee to try to stop him and suddenly ordering him to stop him; Jack yelling «Bang! Bang!» after a sarcastic comment from his father.This film is probably the best prove why Steven Spielberg is considered the «Peter Pan of Hollywood».

The special effects and make up are still top notch. This is also one of Arnold's best movies up there with the Terminator movies. The movie is interlaced with a thought-provoking plot and a lot of violence and gore, with some moments of humour. Besides Robocop, Total Recall is one of Paul Verhoeven's best movies that he has directed to date. Sharon Stone, in an early role, is excellent as Douglas Quaid's wife. It's a shame that Rachel Ticotin has not had any major roles, but she is memorable as Milena, an ally from Quaid's past. Michael Ironside nails his role as the volatile Richter. Ronny Cox as Vilos Cohaagen was a little similar to his character Dick Jones in Robocop, but Cohaagen is more ruthless and sinister.Overall, Total Recall is highly recommended to all sci-fi lovers and Arnold fans. Unless you have a weak stomach, check out this movie if you have not done so already. Get ready for the ride of your life.10\/10.

Hayward plays a shrill, unlikeable & dumb character who wastes oxygen shrieking at the drop of a hat. Successful communication is always 2nd to verbal flailing. There's a reason no one wants to know low class loud-mouths. Just because your subject is unrefined doesn't mean your drama has to be unsubtle.Hayward and her cronies are bizarre hepcats and such, who couldn't find a beat if they were convulsing. The jazz angle is overplayed again though not as obnoxiously as in The Man with the Golden Arm, and In Cold Blood. Regardless of how many stays she received, these delays just prolong the movie. It's called dramatic license. It goes on far too long for a movie whose ending is obvious.Where did Hayward come from, and where did she go? I can't name another one of her movies.
