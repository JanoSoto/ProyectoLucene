This is a story of people, real people and what they must do to survive in the harsh world of military boot camp and, ultimately, in the depths of hell.We see this world of terror through the wide eyes of Matthew Modine. During his stay at Parris Island, he meets his extremely tough sergeant, R. Lee Ermey, and he learns that all of the other recruits are just like he is. Many people believe that boot camp is the highlight of the film and I can see why. I can't think of another movie that makes the viewer feel worried for their own sake when someone is yelling at another character.The first half really sets us up for what's to come. We get to understand our protagonist and end up feeling just like he does. Modine is an everyman type that you can't help but feel for. You know what's going though his head in the bathroom scene because you're thinking the same thing.After boot camp, we're thrust right into the Vietnam scene. Not with combat, but with the way it really was. Prostitutes walking down streets and giving venereal diseases to the soldiers who bring them back home are some of the things you think about when you see the city landscape of where we are.If you've seen and love war movies like I do, you know that after the first combat scene, the feeling of having bullets flying by you just isn't the same. It's different with Full Metal Jacket. The tension in those scenes is drawn out so much that you're hooked into the moment so that even your heart is racing. I believe that these scenes are the best part of the film because there are very few war films that can do that. What makes Full Metal Jacket different from others of its genre is that we know all of the characters. We've met people or are very close friends with characters like Animal, Cowboy, Hartmann, and even Pyle. Very few films do that anymore and to have a war movie do it is something you can't take for granted.The finale sums up everything about the 1950s and '60s. It was the end of an era. When you see the scene, you realize the innocence that was taken away from this country so violently. An entire generation was lost because of this conflict and the world was changed forever.

I've read the books, watched the movies, and have even seen the musical. Peter Pan is my favorite child hood story and Hook only enhances my love of it.I was AMAZED by some of the comments posted. Many who have seen the movie have hated it, despite the brilliant acting, special effects, and an unbelievable plot. But perhaps it is that very unbelievable plot that has left many unsatisfied. Some have problems with it because it conflicts with J.M. Barrie's story. Some have problems with it because they just can't understand the point of the movie. Now is the time that I'd like to point out that, according to the movie, the real Peter Pan conflicts with J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan because the story was second hand from the real Darling children- Wendy, John, and Michael. I have the feeling that many are unsatisfied by the movie because they can't understand it.... and because, as adults, Peter Pan does't seem to carry the same type of fascination as it does for children. That is the only explanation that I've been able to come up with as I've read some of the other comments. And the truth of the matter is that it's based on a children's story. If you don't like the idea of that, then don't watch because there are bound to be some inconsistencies between real life and fantasy. The entire plot revolves around a grown up Peter Pan who has forgotten his entire past in Neverland. He has taken the name of Peter Banning, has married Wendy Darling's granddaughter Moira, has had his own children, and has taken on the very grown up job of being a lawyer, putting his crafty, cunning, and sly nature to use. However, he has become the very thing that, as Peter Pan, he feared. He drinks, works to much, and has no time for play or for his family, something which his wife detests. Peter's children- Jack and Maggie- love him very much, but are constantly put off (especially Jack) b Peter's apparent lack of interest in them.Finally, after the Banning family comes to visit Granny Wendy Darling in London, Peter's children are stolen by a man who calls himself Jas. Hook. Wendy tries to convince Peter that the man who is calling himself Hook is the actual Hook, and has taken the children to Neverland, a place where only Peter can save them. When she tries to tell Peter that he's he actual Peter Pan, Peter refuses to believe.After getting drunk, he finds himself in the Nursery where his children had been staying- the nursery that he has been so many times before. This is when Tinkerbell comes to take Peter away so that he can rescue his children. The pretty much final straw for Tink is when Peter says that he doesn't believe in fairies. Tink reminds him that by saying that he doesn't believe in fairies, he is killing one. He still refuses to acknowledge her as something real. Tink ends up knocking Peter out in ordered to bring him to Neverland- to face off against the notorious Captain Hook!Of course, Peter, unable to believe in anything around him (and still refusing to acknowledge that he's the Pan) can't face off against Hook anytime soon and expect to win. Peter is given 3 days to get back in the shape. Tink will have to reteach Peter how to fly, fight, and crow! I refuse to say any more about the movie, except that, despite it being based on a children's' story with all of the inconsistencies that a fantasy story entails, the movie was probably geared toward teenagers and young adults. An example of this would be the many different allusions made throughout the movie to thinks like Gahndi, lawyers, the 60's, and even one short insult about gynecologists. Saying that, there is nothing in the movie that is terribly inappropriate. There is, however, quite a bit of violence and even a character death. I would caution parents to watch the movie for themselves before letting a 5 year old watch it ( though I personally see nothing wrong with letting a 5 year old watch it. They wouldn't understand it anyway. I'M SPEAKING FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE!). That being said, Hook is a very intricate movie that cannot be fully appreciated until the book is read. That is the only way that all of the little jokes will be caught. An example of this would be when the older Peter is forced to play make believe when dinner is served and, to his surprise, he fines nothing to eat! This would be a reference to the book, which states that one of Peter Pan's favorite games would be to pretend to eat. Another would be the presence of Tootles, now an old man who lives with Wendy still. Anyone who's read the book would know that Tootles was once a Lost boy.I hope that anyone who has taken th time to read this rather lengthy article will take a chance and watch Hook, instead of being cautious and take a few to many negative opinions of the movie a bit to literally. No one ever really grows up. Get in touch with your inner child and watch the movie! You won't regret it.

The film's credits say that it is, Dedicated to all those who are running away. A line of dialog reinforces this idea. Lorusso says, In times like these, escape is the only way. To live and keep dreaming. And yet at the end of the film, Antonio, Lorusso and the Sergeant are all together again on the Greek island that they had wanted to escape so badly at the story's start. They escaped the war by accident. They escaped the reality of their desertion periodically with drugs, sex and games. But the film asserts that once a person allows a culture, a place, or a people to move them, there is no escaping it. Once a person finds beauty within a situation and makes a home out of it, the good feelings and ideals created in that context are forever within them. When Lorusso returns to the island many years after, he says of Italy, They didn't let us change anything. His life on the island had given him an ideal for a compassionate existence, where people can grow and change, and when he didn't feel capable of achieving that in war-torn Italy, he escaped once again to the island where he had been happy.The beauty of this story shines through because of its immense craftsmanship. The story would not have been so moving had the compassionate existence not been created by unlikely people in an unlikely place. The soldiers, the Sergeant admits early on, are a platoon of misfits a Bacchus-like Russian, a frequent deserter who wants to get back to his pregnant wife, a pair of goat-herding brothers from the mountains, a weak and feminine but ever-loyal Antonio, a man in love with Lorusso, and a man in love with his donkey. They are anything but soldierly, and their nationalistic feelings, if they ever had any, quickly wane. I feel abandoned, one of the men comments. Lorusso says, They left us here and here we'll stay. Staying on the island, early in the story, doesn't seem a very welcome proposition since Greece is the Tomb of Italians is written on the wall of the town. But the audience learns, as the characters do, that the townspeople are not only harmless but welcoming and warm. Beautiful cinematography and music ease the audience into a comfortable life on the Greek island along with the soldiers; their senses are our senses, their feelings our feelings, because the elements of film are so carefully crafted. The Sergeant's statement about the poets, philosophers, warriors, and goddesses from which they are all descended sets the tone for the film. Antonio recognizes the poet within himself, Vasilissa the goddess. The Sergeant is clearly a philosopher and Lorusso learns to project his warrior-like tendencies towards compassionate means, such as protecting his friends. The story, by allowing us to feel and witness such growth within such ordinarily quirky and believable characters, suggests that such a compassionate existence is available for everyone. The film is dedicated to the audience, who is allowed to escape within its beauty for a while, and come out knowing a little better what human compassion is capable of.

To live and keep dreaming. And yet at the end of the film, Antonio, Lorusso and the Sergeant are all together again on the Greek island that they had wanted to escape so badly at the story's start. They escaped the war by accident. They escaped the reality of their desertion periodically with drugs, sex and games. But the film asserts that once a person allows a culture, a place, or a people to move them, there is no escaping it. Once a person finds beauty within a situation and makes a home out of it, the good feelings and ideals created in that context are forever within them. When Lorusso returns to the island many years after, he says of Italy, They didn't let us change anything. His life on the island had given him an ideal for a compassionate existence, where people can grow and change, and when he didn't feel capable of achieving that in war-torn Italy, he escaped once again to the island where he had been happy.The beauty of this story shines through because of its immense craftsmanship. The story would not have been so moving had the compassionate existence not been created by unlikely people in an unlikely place. The soldiers, the Sergeant admits early on, are a platoon of misfits a Bacchus-like Russian, a frequent deserter who wants to get back to his pregnant wife, a pair of goat-herding brothers from the mountains, a weak and feminine but ever-loyal Antonio, a man in love with Lorusso, and a man in love with his donkey. They are anything but soldierly, and their nationalistic feelings, if they ever had any, quickly wane. I feel abandoned, one of the men comments. Lorusso says, They left us here and here we'll stay. Staying on the island, early in the story, doesn't seem a very welcome proposition since Greece is the Tomb of Italians is written on the wall of the town. But the audience learns, as the characters do, that the townspeople are not only harmless but welcoming and warm. Beautiful cinematography and music ease the audience into a comfortable life on the Greek island along with the soldiers; their senses are our senses, their feelings our feelings, because the elements of film are so carefully crafted. The Sergeant's statement about the poets, philosophers, warriors, and goddesses from which they are all descended sets the tone for the film. Antonio recognizes the poet within himself, Vasilissa the goddess. The Sergeant is clearly a philosopher and Lorusso learns to project his warrior-like tendencies towards compassionate means, such as protecting his friends. The story, by allowing us to feel and witness such growth within such ordinarily quirky and believable characters, suggests that such a compassionate existence is available for everyone. The film is dedicated to the audience, who is allowed to escape within its beauty for a while, and come out knowing a little better what human compassion is capable of.

Well&#133;you get something that's exciting, brutal, nasty and short &#150; and very little of it truthful.Walter Hill is one of Tinsel Town's better producer\/directors, no question; and his experience at producing great thrillers (like the Alien series) serves him (and the viewer) well. Because this is a thrilling tale of a man who was in fact a legend in his own time (like Buffalo Bill, Billy the Kid, Butch Cassidy and many others), and of a man who obviously didn't relate too well with people in general. Maybe Wild Bill thought that he'd been dealt a raw deal from day one? Who knows...? And that's the upside of this narrative as well as its Achilles Heel &#150; because if you read the history of Wild Bill, you'll find that most of this film is pure fiction. Trouble is, most of what you read about Wild Bill is pure fiction, also. And the sources I researched admit it nobody knows the real truth about how Wild Bill died EXCEPT he did die while playing poker in a saloon. Beyond that, all else, it appears, is up for grabs &#150; which means that any writer\/producer can develop a story that provides a reasonable probability of what might have happened.So, don't pay any heed to reality in this film, beyond the very detailed settings, props, costumes, accents, language &#150; the general mise-en-scene. The story, some of which is told in flashback, is generally fast-paced, with the possible exception of when Bill visits the Chinese opium dens in Deadwood for some light relief, shall I say? But, those episodes also give the director\/cinematography the opportunity to play around with camera angles, shimmering scenes, and such like.What I particularly liked about this movie were the scenes of mid-nineteenth century small towns across USA. Those images compare very well with genuine photos I've seen of that time, particularly those of Deadwood. So, hats off to the production team for those flawless settings, arguably the best I've seen on film to date. In fact, this film is worth seeing for that alone.In contrast, there's a major error that is just unforgivable, considering the overall standard of the production in the final battle scene between Wild Bill and five tough bounty hunters, Bill shoots them all dead with his two revolvers, both of which looked like 1858 or 1861 Remingtons. Those guns are six-shooters. In the gun battle, Wild Bill shoots at least sixteen shots, and maybe eighteen, all without reloading! Don't worry &#150; I checked it by counting those shots, again and again, while going through the battle slowly. What a shame that goof wasn't caught before the film was released...However, the cast is great, particularly Jeff Bridges and John Hurt (as the fictional character, Charley Prince, invented for narrative purposes), both of whom are ably supported by Ellen Barkin as Calamity Jane and David Arquette as Jack McCall. Jeff Bridges must be highlighted for special mention his costumes and general manner look stunningly true to life when compared with real photos of that long dead gunfighter.As a piece of history, forget it. As rip-snorting entertainment, go see it, especially if you love the Western genre. Highly recommended.

He stays close to the tone of Gordon's film while weaving a whole new nutty story, obviously and blatantly paying homage to BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN. In this film Dr. Herbert West(Jeffrey Combs)& Dan Cain(Bruce Abbott)return from the civil war of a Latin country experimenting of dead soldiers trying to perfect the power of his reagent serum for reanimating dead tissue and organs. West has decided that merely bringing the dead back to life isn't as fulfilling as creating a whole human being using variously deposited body parts from freshly dead corpses. The two doctors have returned somehow(I couldn't understand how they were able to get their jobs back because neither finished school..or perhaps they did, but when could they if they were in a foreign country? Plot holes galore..oh, well)to the Miskatonik Hospital with Dan simply wishing to do his job. But, Herbert is at his old tricks again splicing various parts together just seeing if his future plans were possible(his coolest creation is the crawling eye assembled with several fingers and an eyeball). When a patient Dan is close to dies, Herbert wishes to use her head(the beauty of her face and her brain)while also using Meg's heart(we know Meg, played by Barbara Crampton from the first film, is the lost love of Dan's life)to leverage his colleague into assisting him. What Herbert doesn't know is that a doctor at the hospital, Dr. Graves(Mel Stewart), has found some of his reagent and is reviving animals(such as the bat which breaks free flying at his face in attack-mode). When mere animals doesn't satisfy him, Graves revives the dead head of Doctor Hill(David Gale, sparingly used in this sequel)and all hell breaks loose. An inspector, Lt. Leslie Chapham(Claude Earl Jones)is constantly snooping around West and Cain seeking to find a false move to implicate them. His reasoning for doing this..Herbert experimented with the reagent on his wife for whom he had possibly beaten to death! Also, Francesca(Fabiana Udenio), a colleague in the warring country West and Cain escaped, shows up starting a relationship with Dan. Again, a woman has become a major thorn in the working relationship of Herbert and Dan which will lead to a maddening conclusion when re-animated dead, led by Hill, whose head now has bat wings(!)will lead an assault on their basement laboratory(located in their home which was once an old morgue).This sequel, while quite inferior to the first film, has enough wild gags going for it to hold interest. Sadly, it abandons the characters for the exception of Combs who has a field day with this crazy loon. The Bride's sequences are quite grotesque and macabre to say the least. I felt that Gale is quite underused in this flick..not quite the villain he was in the first film, only getting to impact Herbert's life at the end. Also disappointing is Abbott's Dan Cain who seems less a fixture in this film as he was in the first. Sure, themes within the story impact the character, but Abbott just doesn't seem as inspired or his character as strong as in Gordon's film. Hurting this flick is the lack of freshness the previous film had. There's still plenty of gore for the ones who crave it and has enough wackiness to probably at least gather a modicum of interest from fans of the first film.

While it was often overlooked and avoided by the mainstream audience when it was first released, people who have more in common with its titular character than they realised at that time have since embraced it with open arms. Watching it seventeen years later, I can understand how it put some members of the audience off, as it is also Tim Burton's most serious, least light-hearted film. In contrast to Batman, Ed Wood, or even Corpse Bride, Edward Scissorhands is played completely straight, with every note of the story intended to be taken seriously. Or so one might think from experiencing the manner in which the story is presented. Although it is tempting to think of Edward Scissorhands as being intended as satire or a joke, everything that the public knows about Burton suggests that he was totally and utterly serious about the message of the film, both those intended and those that the people the film particularly appeals to have discerned.At its heart, Edward Scissorhands concerns itself with an Avon saleslady named Peg, who finds the titular character within a haunting-looking Gothic mansion after a particular bad day at the grindstone. Unsure what to make of her new acquaintance, she brings him home and embarks on an effort to domesticate him, for lack of a better word. Figuring that all one needs is love, she slowly introduces Edward to the rest of the family, and eventually the neighborhood. At first, everything goes swimmingly, with Edward finding his rather strange condition allows him to do things the stiff-minded townsfolk would not deem possible. But with such sudden acceptance also comes a degree of unhealthy curiosity, not to mention jealousy. As Peg's daughter, played by Winona Ryder in one of her rare fits of relevance, takes more of an interest in the new arrival than she probably should, the normie element starts to deliberate about how to besmirch Edward's character. The manner in which they subsequently behave will strike many who have something in common with the director as oddly familiar.Much of Edward's background is told through the use of flashbacks that not only detail how Edward lived before he was discovered by the bored housewife, but also why he is in the state he is in. The film, or rather its publicity materials, describe him as being unfinished, but I really hesitate to use that word in this context. Unfinished, incomplete, or variations thereof have a very specific connotation, and the reality is that this connotation is very different from the Edward Scissorhands we see in the film. For certain, he lacks fingers, but he not only comes across as being far more sincere than those around him. He also demonstrates that what he lacks, a fully formed set of hands, is far less important than what the townsfolk he is introduced to in the first act lack, an open mind or an imagination. It is no coincidence that the hairstyles and greenery sculptures that he creates using his bladed fingers take on shapes that never occur in the imaginations of the townsfolk. Or within the imaginations of members of the audience, for that matter.As I said, the film marks a transition. Director Tim Burton was starting to be taken seriously as a director with a unique creative vision. Batman had just made so much money that one of its stars wound up being paid more than some small countries make in a year. Beetlejuice was prompting grapevine talk of this weird director who portrayed the afterlife as being warmer than the world of the living. And then there was the star of Edward Scissorhands, a former teen idol by the name of Johnny Depp. Although the effect took more time to become more discernible for Depp, this is but one of the films that began to make audiences and the press alike take him more seriously. Even though he was already twenty-one when he made his debut, it is easy to look back on his early appearances and realise he demonstrates more talent than anyone he shares the screen with. After working with Burton for half a dozen films, I am sure Depp must realise just how perfectly they are matched. The only other actor that comes close to benefiting so much from Burton's direction is Michael Keaton.Indeed, regardless of the colour scheme Burton uses for the different environments of his films, he manages to make one sharply repulsive compared to the other. The mansion in which Edward is found is dark, foreboding, and haunting. Yet it is at the same time so warm and inviting, thanks in no small part to a strong score by Danny Elfman, that one wants to run away with Edward and tell this normalised world they are never coming back. Indeed, after being denied knowledge of what I am for so long, and seeing normies get away with what would be called perjury in a just world during this film, I have to ask those normies one thing. Yours is a world of respect with trust, and mine is not? Tim Burton is therefore not just a director of unique and extraordinary vision. He is the voice for a neglected minority that is being assaulted from all sides by normalists and negationists. Whether he intended this is beside the point, as Edward Scissorhands demonstrates. That he does it so well, and so passionately, makes the end result infinitely more watchable.It is for these reasons and more that Edward Scissorhands is an unqualified ten out of ten film. Burton does not just offer a piece of himself here, he reaches out and touches so many.

Written by Charles McKeown, Tom Stoppard, and Terry Gilliam himself. Starring Jonathan Pryce, and features Robert De Niro, Kim Greist, Michael Palin, Katherine Helmond, Bob Hoskins, and Ian Holm. Co-writer McKeown also has a small role.Taking place in a dystopian future ran by bureaucrats. Brazil is about a man named Sam Lowry, a low level bureaucrat who, despite being conflicted about his role in an apparently overpowered bureaucracy, is actually happy with his job, but still complacent with everyday life. Sam escapes to a fantasy dreamland whenever he sleeps. In his dreams he is some sort of angelic warrior trying to save a woman trapped inside a floating cage. Its not long until his life goes crazy when his mother trys to get him a promotion, he meets a renegade heating engineer, and sees the woman he has literally been dreaming about.The dream sequences are really something to behold, with effects that were amazing for their time and are still amazing even today. The first dream is neat, Sam has some cool metal wings, a shiny breastplate, a sword, and he's flying through the clouds and Sam sees the woman in the cage before he is awaken by the phone. Brazil has some amazing visuals and an equally as amazing story. The story is an incredibly deep one, there are many subplots(which confuses a lot people, but didn't pose a problem for me) and an abrupt, but powerful plot twist at the end, and you really sympathize with the main character through his development throughout the movie. Brazil, like so many other great movies, is full of contradictions, its pessimistic yet whimsical, its serious yet funny, its dark yet romantic. It might be subjective, but I think Brazil is one of the greatest films of all time and I think it deserves to be praised as such. If you haven't seen it already, then see it as soon as possible, in fact stop reading this and go buy it! Needless to say I give this movie 10 out of 10.

We're never told in so many words just why he's condemned to live the same day over and over. It seems that it does have something to do with how very nasty Phil is at the start of things.He hates his job, doesn't care for his co-workers and really doesn't want to be covering Groundhog Day again. So fate steps in and stops time for Phil. He's not going to get past that day until he reforms.It doesn't happen overnight. He spends dozens, if not hundreds of Groundhog Days in Punxatawney. At first he just acts worse, taking advantage of the simple people of the town. But then he realizes that he's in love with his producer (Andie McDowall).So he's got this same day to run over and over again to convince her that he's not a total jerk. And, in order to do that, he needs to reform himself. At first it's just superficial stuff, like remembering her favorite ice cream. But then he has to go beyond that and truly become the man of her dreams. And do it in the few hours that he's got until the whole thing resets again.Bill Murray works wonderfully in this role. His low-key style of humor fits in well with his road to rehabilitation.This film is one of the few I have in my collection. I only buy titles that I'm likely to play over and over.

I never did see David Cronenberg's remake except for a few snippets, but those snippets convinced me that Cronenberg was following his usual impulse to make the viewer's skin crawl. Some of us don't really need that. If we want our skins to crawl all we have to do is get out of bed in the morning. (I'll except Cronenberg's Dead Ringers from those generalization, a truly spooky movie without a pander in it.) As the original, this 1959 version stands tall. They actually seem to have intended to make a horror\/science fiction movie rather than a comedy, and yet they've achieved both.It's a horrifying story of a Montreal scientist, Al Hedison, who invents a teleportation machine that deconstructs objects and sends their elements at the speed of light to a glass box where they are reassembled in their original form. Even the champagne retains its chill. There are, of course, always a few small problems to be ironed out. The printing on a cheap ash tray comes out backward. The pet cat, Dandelot, gets lost somewhere between the transmitter and the receiver. Where is she now? asks the desperate wife, Patricia Owens. Somewhere out in space. A stream of cat atoms, Hedison replies wonderingly. The fact that Dandelot has been thoroughly disassembled doesn't stop her atomic stream from going MEOWWW as it sails off into the ether. (I warned you this was funny.) The general idea is that there are some things man was never meant to know. This used to be called hubris. The story of blundering into the unknown and coming up with unexpected consequences seems to have been especially common in the 19th century when theology was coming to grips with scientific breakthroughs like Darwinism. The theme had a resurgence in the SF movies of the 1950s, following the atomic bomb but Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus is still the holotype.The movie resonates with all sorts of familiar ideas and images. When Hedison's teleporter transmits the words Made in Japan backwards, he wordlessly walks away from his wife to sit at his desk and work on the problem. Just when they were planning a romantic evening together too. Hedison was never more than just half a man from the beginning. At any rate the scene reminded me of the opening of James Joyce's Ulysses, when the atheist Buck Mulligan mocks the Catholic mass by intoning ritualistic mumbo jumbo over his bowl of shaving cream, claiming he's transforming it into the body and blood of the Savior. Looking down puzzled at the untransformed shaving cream, he says, Oops. A bit of trouble with those white corpuscles. Hedison has the head and one arm of a fly, and the fly part is slowly fighting the rest of him for dominance. At one point he's trying to type a note to his wife with his human hand and the fly hand grasps the other's wrist and begins struggling with it, and all we can see is Dr. Strangelove and his gloved hand, which insists on saluting Hitler and strangling its owner.It is, however, a reasonably well-done, if not exactly expert, horror film. We want Hedison to get himself together again but his supporters can never seem to find that fly with the white head. At the end, after Hedison is safely cleaned and pressed, his brother (Vincent Price) and the skeptical police inspector (Herbert Marshall) stumble upon the fly with Hedison's head and arm. The thing is caught in a web and about to be eaten by a spider. HELP ME! HELP ME! it cries in a terrified yet comically tinny voice before Marshall comes unglued and smashes spider and fly with a rock. This scene, with Price and Marshall bent over, peering at the fly in the web, was subject to innumerable retakes because the two actors kept cracking up with laughter and ruining the shot.

Perhaps it's all the hype I'd heard before I watched it. If I hadn't heard the hype maybe I would have switched it off half way through and thought no more of it. Now apparently I have to write 10 lines. Like this movie my question is why? I still haven't written enough. 10 lines is more than this movie is worth! When I've said I don't like it I don't want to spend all my life explaining why.

Years later I rewatched it and realised, it was a quite poor movie.The storyline itself is quite good but the script and acting felt fake. It was as if the script writers were trying very hard to emulate a teen society and at many points the characters were too exaggerated in the attempt to be a 'real teen'.All right, it wasn't all that bad but with all the unnecessary swearing and the main character falling for the love interest based on nothing but a few smirks and flirty exchanges overall destroyed the entire movie.The majority of this movie felt bland and fake. The only part that was REALLY worth watching were the cheerleading performances at the end of the movie. But the rest? Bleurgh. Don't waste your money on watching this movie, watch Bring it On 3 instead.
