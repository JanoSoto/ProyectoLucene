This film is definitely nothing special, and The Sixth Sense was even more so incredibly overrated.First order of business Bruce Willis was pretty darn good in comparison to other films he's appeared in, such as Armageddon, but remained nothing extraordinary. I could just as well say the same for Samuel L. Jackson, though he has had a more impressive track record than Willis (as far as performances). Robin Wright Penn also had a sold performance, though I am not one to criticize acting with much strength. The atmosphere was almost a mirror image to the atmosphere of Sixth Sense, though it was a bit warmer. Many of the cinematography techniques were original, but I think many would agree with my complaint of overuse of original ideas, which really ran this film into the ground. Creativity is great, but overuse can kill. The framing of the train scene is beautiful, but monotonous. The spiraling over the comic book was extremely predictable and in this particular case, not creative. The overuse of hand held camera was useless, because it provoked the wrong emotion in a few instances. The theme was steady, but as his last film M. Night only gives us a few minutes to ponder its existence in the last few seconds of the film. Not to say that surprise endings are bad, but if one is attempting to get across an intelligent message, one should let the audience ponder in it a bit longer, along with the characters. I'd have to say it is an intelligent marketing technique though. Perhaps the reasoning for a quick, spontaneous ending was to surpass the lack of depth in the theme Without evil, there would be no good to impress with the entertaining and surfaced story. It seems the film builds up to a stark nothing that instills a feeling of emptiness, which pointlessly juxtaposes the redemption in Willis' character. The captions were utterly pointless at the end, probably the most disappointing conclusion I've witnessed in some while.In other words, if you like The Sixth Sense, you will most likely enjoy this. If you though the Sixth Sense was somewhat pretentious, surfaced, and extremely overrated, I am almost sure you will obtain that similar feeling though this film.**1\/2 of **** ","genre":null},{"date":"7 December 2000","score":"","review":"  As it was for his first film, M.

Does Jackson need to bother to apply anymore? Can he just write in the name of the school and his name, affix a club seal and head off the next fall? Why, then, can't the Skulls just get him the law diploma of his choice? Surely, two years down the road they'd be prepared to fix the bar exam for him as well.This is the basic problem (well, 1 basic problem) with The Skulls, a 2000 release directed by Rob Cohen (on his best days described as a quality TV director, on his worse days described as the director of Sly Stallone's dullest if not worse film Daylight). Too often things in The Skulls that should remain mysterious made literal and almost immediately become ridiculous. And once enough things are literallized everything begins to seem goofy by extension. For example, we're working with the most secretive society in the world. Members aren't allowed to tell people that they're members. However, when they have their initiation, everybody walks into ornate secret clubhouse, in single-file in the middle of the evening. Not much secretive about that. Similarly, with enough pull to control the Supreme Court and Senate, why couldn't the Skulls do anything to control a simple smalltown suicide investigation? Or at least avoid botching a simulated suicide in the first place?And why would Jackson's character basically bank his college career on ultimately being invited to a secret society that admits 8 people (or so) a year? On the basis of rowing for the crew team? Or because he overcame being a petty thief and his mother's death? These things *do* look fine on the law school application of your choice, but will they get you into the most powerful whatever in the whatever? Give me a break. Also, the notion that there was only one legacy among the entering Skulls' class? Well, anybody who's ever spent any time at an Ivy League school can tell you how likely that would be. And how did Jackson's character know the deadline for Skulls notification anyway? That's also not very mysterious. And the fact that *another* secret society has a nifty on-campus clubhouse with a moat that nobody ever watches... Grumble. It just goes on.These are only silly things that pop up in the first 45 minutes of The Skulls. No point in spoiling any genuine surprises why asking why they weren't really surprising. The script by Eric Pogue seems to make up its own rules and not entirely successfully. Beyond the problem with over-explaining, the script is constantly over-expositional. Once again, with every secret that's told, things become less interesting, rather than moreso.An interesting choice is that only two of the younger generation of Skulls, the new inductees played by Jackson and Paul Walker, have any dialogue. We have no idea what anybody else did to get where they are. Instead, there are a host of older Skulls. You'd say that these roles were a waste of good actors, but it's been a long time since anybody called Craig T. Nelson, Christopher McDonald, or William Petersen good actors. You know Nelson is acting because he has a moustache. Petersen (as perhaps the only interesting character in the film) does a flimsy Bill Clinton impression. And McDonald does absolutely nothing, but I guess he has to work.Jackson and Walker don't have much by way of whatever. Because Jackson's character is so unimaginably morally righteous, the film lacks any conflict at its center. Everything is absolutely black and white. And uninteresting. Walker has a moment or two of conflict, but his character, a spoiled heir to the Skulls empire,   is so minor that despite his screentime, he probably won't make much of an impact on anybody who isn't a teenage girl.Everything in the film is overdone.

It doesnt mean I like all films with that theme, but it helps a great deal.I also didnt want to see Carrie 2. That was until it came out on cable so I could see it for free. Carrie is for my money the best horror film of all time, and one of my favourite films, Carrie 2 was a wasted oppurtunity to make another great film on this strong dramatic premise. And for the opening 20 minutes it seems to be going great. The opening (Apart from the black and white flashes) is great, the music is on target and the cinematography is terrific (In fact the cinematography is a standout throughout the film). However after the first 20 minutes there is a dramatic change of feel to the film, and it all starts to go downhill from there.*SPOILERS*. Problems with this film are not hard to pick. The scene where the teacher foreshadows the whole premise is obvious and embarrassing. In this film Rachel is not as maladjusted as Carrie was, in fact she seems smart, cool and she doesnt seem to have a desperate need to belong. She really is part of her own group. Which makes her inevitable tragedy all that much harder to understand. Why does she want to go to a party full of people she doesnt like and who she knows for a long time haven't liked her. How does she become so nieve in the third act to fall for what they have in store. Other problems are the character of her boyfriend in the film. Not only is he too nice to have been part of the Jock Group to begin with but his character transformation to selfless lover of Racheal is impossible to swallow, especially after having slept with the villain girl of the plot the night before, and obviously having been part of their beeding contest all up until he decides he loves Racheal. Also his removal via being held up by the villian girl from the party in the third act means the film loses what could have been a great dramatic set piece for the finale of the film. Two last minor problems the villain in this only seems to have one friend which means that she isnt any more popular than racheal when it comes down to it (Racheal having been shown with a friend early in the film and also having her boyfriend later on).The ending to the film is the part which really shows it all. The character says what everyone in the audience should be feeling by this point. It is an admission of failure on the filmmakers part that they had to include this line of dialogue. Sue Snell is really an out of place character, the telekenisis is overplayed and the teacher campaigning against the Jock during the statutory rape trial is almost totally unbelievable.The few good points of this film are the Cinematography (Which really is great) the theme music, and the performance of Emily Bergl.

It doesnt mean I like all films with that theme, but it helps a great deal.I also didnt want to see Carrie 2. That was until it came out on cable so I could see it for free. Carrie is for my money the best horror film of all time, and one of my favourite films, Carrie 2 was a wasted oppurtunity to make another great film on this strong dramatic premise. And for the opening 20 minutes it seems to be going great. The opening (Apart from the black and white flashes) is great, the music is on target and the cinematography is terrific (In fact the cinematography is a standout throughout the film). However after the first 20 minutes there is a dramatic change of feel to the film, and it all starts to go downhill from there.*SPOILERS*. Problems with this film are not hard to pick. The scene where the teacher foreshadows the whole premise is obvious and embarrassing. In this film Rachel is not as maladjusted as Carrie was, in fact she seems smart, cool and she doesnt seem to have a desperate need to belong. She really is part of her own group. Which makes her inevitable tragedy all that much harder to understand. Why does she want to go to a party full of people she doesnt like and who she knows for a long time haven't liked her. How does she become so nieve in the third act to fall for what they have in store. Other problems are the character of her boyfriend in the film. Not only is he too nice to have been part of the Jock Group to begin with but his character transformation to selfless lover of Racheal is impossible to swallow, especially after having slept with the villain girl of the plot the night before, and obviously having been part of their beeding contest all up until he decides he loves Racheal. Also his removal via being held up by the villian girl from the party in the third act means the film loses what could have been a great dramatic set piece for the finale of the film. Two last minor problems the villain in this only seems to have one friend which means that she isnt any more popular than racheal when it comes down to it (Racheal having been shown with a friend early in the film and also having her boyfriend later on).The ending to the film is the part which really shows it all. The character says what everyone in the audience should be feeling by this point. It is an admission of failure on the filmmakers part that they had to include this line of dialogue. Sue Snell is really an out of place character, the telekenisis is overplayed and the teacher campaigning against the Jock during the statutory rape trial is almost totally unbelievable.The few good points of this film are the Cinematography (Which really is great) the theme music, and the performance of Emily Bergl. Other than that one can only wonder what this film would have been like with a better script and if the original director had been kept (Because the replacement really lost it, sorry but its true).If there is one thing to be learnt from this film it is that filmmakers should go back to telling horror stories that derive their power from the dark emotions within the story rather than the flashy editing and blood and guts of the recent horror films that have flooded the cinemas.Also Tom Burman always does great makeup FX.

The story is thin at best.  The NFL is having a players strike and scabs are called in to finish the season.  Our heroes are low on ability but high on desire and peculiarity.  The quarterback, Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), once had a promising career, but he fell apart psychologically when his team was pummelled in a college bowl game and he was labelled a player that folds in the big game.  Of course, while visiting the NFL, Shane falls in love with the head cheerleader (Brooke Langton) who never dates players (except of course this once).All this is merely a mundane excuse for a raucous and silly comedy that has some sidesplitting moments.  To enjoy this film you really need two things. You need to love football and you need to enjoy slapstick, banana peel comedy.  I realize that this limits the audience considerably, but for those who qualify (and I am one), this movie is a scream.Director Howard Deutch (Pretty in Pink, Grumpier Old Men) did a great job on the football sequences.  He hired 45 professional football players (Former NFL players, Canadian Football League, etc.) to do the football scenes and sent the actors to a three-week football camp.  The action looked real because it was real.  The players were told to play and hit the way they normally would.  Of course, the plays were choreographed, but they were real football plays.The comedy was lowbrow, outrageous and crass, with a great deal of physical comedy.  The cheerleader scenes were a riot, especially the cheerleader tryouts.  The scene where they started pantomiming sex acts to distract the opposing team was priceless.  There was also sharp-witted football humor that required more than just a passing knowledge of the game.There isn't much serious that can be said about the acting.  Keanu Reeves tried to play an earnest comeback and romantic role amidst all the foolishness and it really didn't fit with the rest of the film.  However, he was an excellent athlete.  He did most of his own on-field shots and looked very believable as the quarterback.  Gene Hackman was good when he was making snappy wisecracks, but his inspirational `Hoosiers' imitation was misplaced.This film really belonged to the supporting actors like Orlando Jones (Clifford Franklin), Michael Taliferro and Faizon Love (The Jackson Twins), Ace Yonamine (Jumbo Fumiko), Rhys Ifans (Nigel `The Leg' Gruff) and all the cheerleaders who made the comedy work.  Jon Favreau gets a special mention as the crazy S.W.A.T. officer turned linebacker who took the wild man role to the next level.This film won't be fun for everyone, but it will have certain people falling off their chairs.

And with them, Jarmusch does what he does best  he invites the audience in to share some time with the individuals who populate his landscape, as he places them under the microscope to study the minutiae of their lives.  In his hands, the details of everyday existence become fresh and new, like the first time you see a new city or make the acquaintance of a total stranger who forever after becomes a part of your life.  It's an intimate style of filmmaking, almost voyeuristic, wherein the camera becomes the eyes of the audience and makes the viewer more than a mere onlooker; it places you in the scene, which allows you to experience what the characters are experiencing, to live what they are living.  When someone is walking down the street, you're on that street with them, feeling the pavement beneath your feet; in the train depot, you drink in the atmosphere, feeling the texture of the walls, of the aged wood of the benches, smelling the age-old scents of time that hang on the air.  You're there with the young couple from Japan, in Memphis to see Sun Studios and Graceland; and with the young widow from Rome, passing through with the casket of her late husband awaiting transport at the airport; and with three young men who have too much to drink and within a few hours find out how quickly life can become so complicated. \tJarmusch works with such precision that it makes everything that happens seem spontaneous; it's an innate sense of knowing what works, and how to make that necessary connection with the audience by making all that transpires real.  He's a skilled craftsman who knows what he wants and exactly how to deliver it.  He creates the proper atmosphere, then introduces you to the characters through which his story will be told.  And once the stage is set, Jarmusch knows that `who' these people are and what makes them unique is as important as the story itself, for in a sense, the characters `are' the story.  It's an examination of human nature; of traits and of how people function under certain circumstances.  And through each character the viewer gets a different perspective on what is happening, along with some insight into how we all relate to one another in a given situation, from the mundane to the bizarre.   \tTo tell his tale, Jarmusch has assembled a talented, eclectic cast of actors, including Masatoshi Nagase (Jun) and the charismatic Youki Kudoh (Mitsuko), the couple from Japan with opposing perspectives of Memphis; Nicoletta Braschi (Luisa), the widow awaiting a flight back to Rome; Elizabeth Bracco (Dee Dee), a young woman whose life is in transition; Tom Noonan (Man in Diner), a man with a menacing presence and a strange tale to tell; Steve Buscemi (Charlie), a regular guy led astray by trusting indifference, along with Rick Aviles (Will Robinson) and Lowell Roberts (Lester); Stephen Jones, a dead-ringer for Elvis who is extremely effective here as his ghost; and the two whose characters are pivotal to the story, Screamin' Jay Hawkins (Hotel Night Clerk), and Cinque Lee (The Bellboy).  And--heard, but not seen-- Tom Waits (Voice of the Radio DJ).  Thoroughly engrossing and highly entertaining, `Mystery Train' is vintage Jarmusch; a director whose minimalist techniques and style make for a satisfying and rewarding movie-going experience.

I am not a huge action movie fan, i always loved more the movies that actually use your brain at least a little bit, but i have to say that this film is probably one of the best action movies i have ever seen. I saw it again last night and, again, i liked it a lot.It's maybe one of the very few cases in which the sequel is better than the original. Cause Die Hard 3 is better, more spectacular and more thrilling than both DH1 and DH2. This time, Bruce Willis (John McClane) has to deal with the brother of the terrorist he killed in the first part - role played very well by Jeremy Irons. Simon (that's his name) puts Bruce to a series of games, riddles and puzzles, decided to revenge for what Bruce did to his brother.Well in this movie Bruce is not alone fighting the bad guys. He has a new best friend - a black racist played absolutely superbly by one of my all time fav actors, Samuel L Jackson. They are brilliant together, with very funny one liners and a perfect chemistry. (They both have played in another movie - Pulp Fiction - but in that film they actually never had not even one scene together).The movie kicks off very good, with Simon (Jeremy Irons) putting the duo to a series of mind games, with the threat of blowing up high quality bombs in public places. The first part of the film is thrilling and exciting - that's what i call a perfect action movie. You just can't get your eyes off the screen.  The second part is a bit different though. The action loses from imagination and thrill once we get to the point where we find out what Simon really wants. From this moment, the film becomes a classic action, with no difference from all the action movies out there.In conclusion, an enjoyable film, that you definetely should watch.

What makes the film even more remarkable is that it is the directorial debut by Francis Ford Coppola's daughter, Sofia, best known prior to this by her less-than-stellar performance in 'Godfather 3'! Her sensitivity with this material establishes her as a director to be reckoned with, and a true directorial talent!The film focuses on the five Lisbon sisters, beautiful, yet repressed by a religious and overly protective mother (Turner), who encourages their intellectual growth, but tries to block any sexual or emotional stirrings. The girls turn their passions into other channels, bonding tightly with one another, and viewing the world as outsiders. When the youngest attempts, then succeeds at killing herself, the family gains an unwanted notoriety, and a group of local boys begin to worship the remaining sisters from afar, gathering materials, and creating a fantasy world about them.Lux, the most beautiful and free-spirited of the sisters (Dunst), attracts the attentions of the most popular boy in school, Tripp (Hartnett), who confuses raging hormones with love, and begins a campaign to 'have' her. Winning the respect of their father (James Woods, in another excellent 'against-type' portrayal), he succeeds in wearing the mother down, and arranges 'dates' for the sisters, so he can take Lux to the Homecoming Dance. The party provides the springboard for the tragedy that gives the film its name, and catapults the girls into icons that the boys who admire them can never forget.There are many reasons to buy this film; Coppola's understanding of how boys and girls interact, and her sure touch with their issues about sexuality; Kirsten Dunst's best performance to date, conveying both sweetness, and barely suppressed erotic desire; Kathleen Turner's breakthrough as a character actress, sacrificing her glamorous persona for a stocky and frumpy matron. There are some excellent cameos, as well, particularly Danny DeVito as a clueless psychiatrist, Scott Glenn as a family priest who offers platitudes instead of comfort, and Michael Paré as an older Tripp, reminiscing about Lux, and their 'love'.This is a very special film, one that you will not soon forget!

The story from this point is fascinatingly played out in a unique style by the director and the tension builds up so much that near the end it was almost unbearable! I had to remind mysef that it was only a film! The films gritty realism is juxtaposed by moments of fantastic and beautiful cinematography during the song-and-dance sequences. I am not a big fan of Bjork but here her singing was fantastic. I also think that the songs were a necessary antidote to the powerful dramatic scenes of the movie which would otherwise be unbearable, such was their pathos and power to move. The acting by all was excellent (though Catherine Deneuve seemed too glamorous to be a factory worker!) and Bjork was a revelation! I dont know if this film can be nominated for Oscars as it is not a US movie but if it could she would walk away with the Best Actress prize. Simply awesome performance. which clutches at the strings of your heart as well. Without giving the ending away I would also say that this film is one of the best arguments i've seen against the death penalty (even though I believe in capital punishment.) My mind and emotions have not been jolted like this for a long time. I left the cinema emotionally drained. Brilliant film-making. Almost perfect.

Swimming With Sharks is not a film on par with either of those two films, but in my opinion, this is Kevin Spacey's most dynamic and utterly believable performance.  It is worth renting 8 times over to watch Spacey's do his foul mouth, smarmy, sarcastic, ultra-egomaniac act better than he has ever done before and better than he has done since.Spacey plays Buddy Ackerman, a powerful Hollywood studio executive with a menacing reputation as the Boss From Hell.  Frank Whaley plays Guy, a film school graduate that becomes Buddy's assistant as a way to gain eventual clout and power in the business, like Buddy's other past assistants.  He quickly learns that Buddy really is the `Boss From Hell' like his former assistant warned him and the movie is about him going off the deep end as a result.Spacey's performance is not only ruthless and menacing, it is bitterly hilarious and downright amazing.  Think of every single cutting putdown and insult that has been directed at you by someone else in your entire lifetime and odds are, Spacey's Buddy Ackerman character can top all of them all in about three sentences combined.  He says things to Guy like My bathmat means more to me than you.  His code of ethics to any of his assistants is You Are Nothing.  Your Opinions Are Nothing.  You Are Here For Me.  I Call The Shots.  You Listen.  This is the kind of boss that you'd fall out of your chair laughing your ass off watching him yell at all of his employee's, but that you'd feel like a worthless piece of trash if you ever had to work for him.The movie itself does have its flaws.  I am not convinced by the love story subplot between Guy and the woman producer.  And compared to Spacey, Whaley looks like a fish out of water in the portrayal of his character.  But the true message of the film lies within the scenes between Spacey and Whaley in Buddy's home.  Buddy might be the boss from hell, but he earned that right.  He fetched coffee and licked boots as an assistant once, too, and he didn't complain because that's life.  The ending (which trust me, you won't see coming) contrives the message a little, but it follows the general theme of the movie (be it to the complete and utter extreme) Show Business is ruthless and you don't get from point A to point B just being nice.Swimming With Sharks is not an easy movie to find at the video store.  This is one you have to look for.  It is a comedy (be it a `Black' comedy) and you will find it in that section.  I have no idea why critics were not as warm to this film as Spacey's other films.  I gather it is because he was not a notable Hollywood leading man then.  Had a film like this come out in the year 2000 in the aftermath of Spacey's American Beauty performance, they'd be hailing it as one of the best films of the year and would be naming Spacey an Oscar favorite.  I give this an 8 out of 10 (for Spacey's performance mostly, but the film itself is pretty good on it's own rites) ","genre":null},{"date":"7 December 2000","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  Yes, this includes his subtly brilliant performance in The Usual Suspects and his wonderful middle-age angst ridden turn in American Beauty.
