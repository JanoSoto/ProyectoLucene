The acting wasnt very convincing either, the best actor was the guy who played 'Lestat' although I didnt think he would be a cool vampire.  Aaliyah's first appearance was quite stunning but after that she didnt add anything exciting to the movie. A vampire who reveals his past and comes back after a long time, sounds a good idea indeed but it got me so sleepy, so lil action sigh.  And the end was pretty pathetic too. I wonder why Lestat and Jessie get together in the end cos they dont care for each other, my opinion is Jessie just wanted to be a vampire herself.

Mira Nair, a female director of India decent, directed the film. This film carries her unique style of filmmaking along with a theme of romance and love which is usually a constant in most of her films.  Her style of filmmaking in Monsoon Wedding can be described as very contemporary film, yet with it she brings a documentary aspect to the film.  Her incorporation of cinema verirte systematically appears through out the film, but in form does not relate at all to the plot or story line itself. Which is one of the reasons that this film can be criticized for falling short of an international film, for the basic reason that Hollywood cinema style can easily be seen, taking away from the different aspects to the Indian life and culture. Throughout there are many scenes in which the film incorporates this contemporary theme of how America is starting to influence India and its people.  A portrayal of contemporary cinema is seen in the added dramas' needed to be in place of this wedding for affect.  The absolute stand out in the film is the unnecessary aspect of a relative who comes from America and has a pedophile relationship with a young girl for it only to be discovering that this has happened before with Ria, a relative, when she was younger. This underlying theme takes away from the film itself and the plot of this scenario can easily be discovered between the reaction of Ria and the American relative when they first interact in the film.  Lastly, of course it the typical happy ending mostly applied to contemporary film where everyone is happy and every one finds new love in his or her life.Nair's influence of cinema verirte feebly attempt to show the real life of India and their culture most definitely falls short of what I would assume a realistic look into the present day lives of India.  The first problem with this is the fact that the family although seems to have money problems, one would feel that they are higher class than the norm.  Then her attempts to incorporate average lives of the people of India are mostly subtle evolving around the wedding and the family, but a few shots are brought to attention in the film.  Such as the scenes that take place in the market along with when Aditi is riding in the car and a few shots are taken in a first person point of view with a cinema vererte aspect displaying venders and workers in the city.  The only cinema verirte that my actually fit into the story line is when the wedding planner, Dubey, who states how he is very well off is seen at his home which is not what a typical western view of well off is. Monsoon Wedding does succeed in giving insight to many aspects to India and their traditions about weddings.  Through this the many themes that usually accompany India film can be seen, for instance, the soap opera aspect to the wedding and wondering of Aditi's commitment to her arranged marriage, as well as, the many lives which find love between complete strangers. Another is the simple traditions of singing and chanting which one would assume to be common in wedding preparation.  In the end, the film accomplishes its main purpose fulfilling the story of an Indian wedding and the melodrama included in it.

In the beginning of the film, there is a shot of the artic circle where Otto gives a brief narrative explanation of his life and how his circle is not yet complete.  From there the film follows the interaction of Otto and Ana who meet through pure coincidence and how through their meeting the film takes form.  By the interaction of Otto toward Ana the two's parents meet making way for the eventual marriage of Otto's father and Ana's mother. Mede takes a scene of Ana's mother driving them back from school many times over replaying it, yet with the storyline of time passing until a red bus almost hits their car, which is displayed in other scenes, in which Mede finally shows Otto and Ana as adolescences.  The love between the two siblings is started in one scene in which the two are reading of the artic circle.  From there the film continues on its course relaying its theme of circles.  As Otto's father left his mother, later Ana's mother left Otto, and along with the death of Otto's mother separates Otto's and Ana's relationship for a time.

Yet in Ana's eyes, she finds the paper and runs to the office of the German Otto when there is a shot of papers flying then her coming to the office only to find Otto there. Therefore, by this unique point of view between the eyes of Ana and Otto, this open ending leaves one to wonder what the film is really trying to explain about these circles in life with love, fate, and death.

Therefore, by this unique point of view between the eyes of Ana and Otto, this open ending leaves one to wonder what the film is really trying to explain about these circles in life with love, fate, and death.  It also allows for self-interpretation leaving, I feel, one more fulfilled in the end, giving one's own answer to the meaning of those questions of love, fate, and death.

We didn't drop anything this big on Iraq!Perfect is the story of a Rolling Stone reporter (Travolta) who trips over his ethics, or lack there of while writing two big stories. His first story deals with a computer tycoon in hot water with the U.S. government for selling his products to an Eastern-Bloc country. This angle is played way up considering the lack of details we are told about the situation. No matter, the story you will remember deals with a swanky health club in L.A.. Travolta wishes to write a piece about how health clubs in the 1980s are replacing the singles bars of the 1970s as the #1 place for people to meet. Take that premise and see how long you can stretch it. Director Bridges apparently thought he could drag it out for nearly two hours and still keep our attention.This film suffers from a severe lack of focus. There are too many location changes to count. There is also too much running around and too much time wasted on insignificant little things. For example, what was up with Travolta's sudden trip to Morocco near the end of the film. It had no purpose what so ever! Another problem this film has is its tendency to drag out every scene to last as long as whatever cheesy 80s dance song is playing in the background. That gets old pretty darn quick.This film is also hopelessly dated in terms of fashion. If any guy came into my health club wearing tights or a fish-net tank top, he'd probably get beaten up. Bridges & CO also try to recycle a gag that worked in Urban Cowboy. In that film, there was a scene featuring numerous women dressed up for a Dolly Parton look-alike contest. In this film, we get about a hundred people dressed up as Boy George in a scene at a hotel. In Urban Cowboy it worked since there was a legitimate reason for all the people to dress that way. They were at least trying to win a contest. The scene in Perfect is useless and it only serves to date the film even further. This film was by no means Travolta's worst. Has anyone seen The Experts or Shout? This film did, however, have his most embarrassing scene. In it, he's sweating away in Jamie Lee Curtis's aerobics class and doing a never-ending series of pelvic thrusts to the dance beat. His crotch has obviously been stuffed with a sock, or perhaps the thing Hammer used in his Pumps in a Bump video. Truly hilarious!Travolta is a talented actor, but he has nothing to work with here. Jamie Lee Curtis is also a great talent, but she is wasted as well. She looks absolutely gorgeous, but her character is so moody and abrasive that we can hardly stand her. The supporting cast of mostly unknowns fills out their respective stereotypical roles as well as they can.In all, this is a poor film on all levels. It tries to be an insightful look at journalistic ethics and falls flat on its face. It comes off as being little more than a two hour plug for Rolling Stone Magazine.

Woody Allen plays a sarcastic, ego-centered, and obsessive over the misery of the world comedian, who meets Diane Keaton, whose character is based on the stereo-typical mid-western girl, who moved to the big city.  Though I felt the film displayed many loose comical stereo-typical views of the time setting of the late seventies.

The story line is of this film a meeting between the two in which they engage in a game of tennis with friends.  Soon a relationship follows and the start of their problems begins.  Allen's character whom obsessed with death and many other enlightened thinking pushes his ideas upon her slowly smothering Annie till she breaks.  When Annie tries to confront Allen's character he only avoids her questions and comments by trying to move the subject to a sexual nature.    In the end, the two break apart mutually, because of his smothering and her desire to have freedom.  She lives in Los Angels while Woody whom refuses to live anywhere else stays in New York. His character's problems are the sole entertainment of the film and without his absurd behavior the film would be nothing but a sappy lover story.Allen does a wonderful job in adding the desired affect a highly sarcastic, socially disabled comedian who fears change and can only be happy when misery is involved.  His use of direct confrontation in acknowledging the audience only adds to the film.  His use of it is not over done and usually unexpected.  In one scene he and Annie are standing in line for a movie when a man disturbing him about the work of another man is forced to hear how his Harvard opinions are totally off based by the man whose work he was describing.  Diane Keaton however is to Allen's character as yin is to yang. Though she makes the character believable, there are too many accruing stereotypes of the Midwestern girl in the big city.

Other stereo-types which can easily be seen are of the people of the time period, mostly when the two visit Los Angeles, though these are found comical never the less the films subplot of pointing out all the negative stereo types cannot be denied.  In one scene at a party there are numerous stereo types of Hollywood, for example the people are all on drugs, or a more specific example, the shot of Jeff Goldblum talking on the phone to his spiritual advisor saying, `I have lost my mantra.'  Though this only adds to the comedic level of the film there is something to be said of Woody's own personal opinions possibly being sent through this film.To paraphrase my point Annie Hall is a magnificently hysterical film, though its humor acts as a double edge sword.  Through the use of a cynical New Yorker whose only fate would seem is to be miserable, Woody Allen comically expresses his views of the total loose American culture of the late seventies.

In many ways it is simply a remake of Videodrome, but I would argue it is an upgrade, an improvement on its 1982 predecessor. Although the story is essentially the same (although eXistenZ's focus is on virtual reality computer games rather than TV and video), eXistenZ is the superior film it has a sleek, more sophisticated look (Videodrome visually has not aged terribly well) and the plot is easier to follow, which enables the film's ideas to be conveyed with greater clarity.eXistenZ is the quintessential Cronenberg film.  It retains the clean but cold, almost metallic look which permeates most of his work.  But most of all, it brings to bear all of the key ideas which run through the whole of Cronenberg's body of work.  For instance, we see the continued emphasis on the breakdown of the division between man and machine.  The pods\/consoles in eXistenZ are fleshy, organic, vaguely resembling female genitalia, a metaphor for the fusion of man and machine which characterises Cronenberg's view of modern life.  The chords from the pods into the players' 'bio-ports' resemble umbilical chords, again to further this continued metaphor of the man\/machine fusion.  Of key importance in eXistenZ is not only the blurring of the man\/machine distinction, but also the eroticisation of this distinction.  The 'bio-ports' on the players' lower backs have a distinctly 'vaginal' quality, much like the slot in James Woods' stomach in Videodrome, which is emphasised further by the groans of sexual pleasure Jennifer Jason Leigh utters when the chords are installed into the ports.  In this respect, eXistenZ deals with the same themes as Crash, but is done to better effect. Crash was, in my view, a profoundly underwhelming film, whereas eXistenZ is infinitely more exciting and intriguing.A further essential Cronenbergian theme in eXistenZ, indeed, the central theme of the film, is the implosion of reality and virtual reality, an idea which again mirrors those in Videodrome.  The main players are in a perpetual state of confusion as to whether they are still in eXistenZ, or have returned to reality.  This is brought to bear most clearly in the final sequence, which hammers home the notion that there is no longer a real to separate the simulated reality of eXistenZ reality and hyperreality have, in Cronenberg's world, imploded.eXistenZ, along with works such as Crash and Videodrome, is essentially an allegorical commentaries on the implosion of meaning in the (post) modern world.  It highlights the way in which we find it increasingly difficult to make sense of anything in a world in which the boundaries between man and machine, reality and virtual reality have imploded.  Cronenberg's world is grotesque, dizzying, schizophrenic and nonsensical, much like contemporary life in the capitalist West, and in this respect eXistenZ is Cronenberg's definitive statement of this.

Nothing made any sense,the script was rubbish and the acting was terrible.Spoilers Indy has a clue where the Ark is hidden so he gathers a team of men and gets it out without the Germans noticing what he is doing?

Hiring three no-name actors to play the parts was a brilliant way to dupe people into thinking this was a true event, and their acting was phenomenal. Not a bit of faked angst or anger. It was all real. Except for the fact that Heather the main character holds onto her camera while trying to kick the crap out of Mike for getting them further lost in the woods. I think she would have put the camera down or something. Oh well.The movie's scariest point is its Hitchcockian style of not showing you what's out there. Too often in scary movies they try to TELL you what's scary by having a guy in a black cloak with a skewed mask chase after people with a knife. That doesn't do anything for me, he just looks stupid. The real fear is the fear of the unknown. When you cannot SEE what is out there, your imagination runs wild and you imagine the worst. That coupled with the confusing and disturbing final footage of the film crew examining an old abandoned cottage with disturbing findings all over the walls, ending with the cameras falling violently to the ground and uncertainty as to what happened to the film crew, and who it was that was doing all that screaming around them, made this a truly terrifying experience.To add to the terror I felt, after watching this, I walked upstairs to find all the lights off and the front door open, and nobody there, and I armed myself with a kendo stick for the rest of the night.
