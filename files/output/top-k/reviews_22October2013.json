But in this particular case, that kind of attitude would be definitely wrong and unfair. The 1995 version of Sabrina by Sidney Pollack is by far better in my opinion. The story is of course the same. A young and inexperienced girl goes to work in Paris and reinvents her personality and her style. When she comes back, radically changed, she finally catches the attention and the romantic interest of the man she has been in love with since her teenage years. But his strict and workaholic brother is determined not to let the romance evolve at any cost out of fear that this could destroy his business plans! As far as the characters are concerned, the truth is that there has been a little but important change. For example, Julia Ormond's Sabrina is stronger, more confident, independent and eloquent than the character of the 1954 film. Audrey Hepburn played a naive and more intimidated girl. Greg Kinnear's David in in exactly the same mood as in the original, meaning a good-hearted, charming, but a little superficial and irresponsible playboy. Now, in my opinion, the most interesting character is the older brother, Linus, who in this film is portrayed as having a much darker, cynical and introverted (almost rude) character than in the original. I personally like this change because I think it makes the plot and the hero more interesting (I think the line the world's only living heart donor is hilarious and a classic!) At this point, we should absolutely give an honorable mention to Harrison Ford's performance(for which he was nominated for a golden globe that year). He plays the sort of villain of the story in a most convincing and elegant way. Contrary to most of his roles, this time Ford adopts harsh facial expressions (almost not smiling at all) and a very severe look. this is why his attempt to soften a little bit in order to approach Sabrina creates- an almost adorable- contradiction. Personally, I think that Ford and Ormond have definitely more chemistry than the original couple of Bogart and Hepburn and that they are way more convincing. Finally, I would like to mention the magnificent music of John Williams and the songs of Sting- all these create a really romantic but still modern fairytale. I highly recommend the movie since it's romantic, funny and quite clever actually. I give it a 9\/10.

It's about a post- apocalyptic world in which the lowly knife has become the weapon of choice. There are a few guns, but I guess everyone ran out of ammo. And that makes Cyborg a pure fantasy because the knife will never be more than a secondary weapon no matter how far we slip as a civilization. Spears, swords, axes, hammers, and bows will all take precedence. Not to mention armor. Those aforementioned weapons do make a few appearances in this movie, but the characters all seem to prefer knives for some reason. Why? Because it makes for some awesome fight scenes. They really are great. Whoever choreographed the action in Cyborg knew what they were doing. It's rare in an action movie, but you can follow a scene and conclude that, Yeah, one man really could beat several bad guys like that. Cyborg has several one-vs-many martial arts sequences that are cohesive and make sense. Those intense few scenes set Cyborg apart and make it worth watching. And do you really want any more in a movie than some of the best knife- fight scenes ever made? Hopefully not, that's all Cyborg has. The script was clearly gutted from its original because the cyborg in Cyborg is treated as an afterthought. It's a woman that decided to have herself enhanced with mechanical parts in order to carry information about a plague back to the last scientists who can cure it. Why do you need to be turned into a cyborg to carry info about a disease? I'd love to know. Anyways, for all the back-story on the cyborg, she doesn't do anything for the entire movie. She just sits by while good guys and bad guys have awesome fights all around her. They are fighting over possession of her, yet she does nothing. You'd hope that as a cyborg, she might have some cyborg abilities that help in a fight.

Yet, it is with 'Batman & Robin' that he fully achieved his objective.- The franchise's world, so creatively created by Burton, is now a complete mess; very dark and Gothic remnants from Burton mixed up horribly with colorful structures that are an eyesore. - Terrible, laughable special effects. Not just badly used, but silly, overly phony and very outdated. - The story is forgettable; the writer tries to cram up far too many plot points in there and ends up with a mess. Furthermore, he seems to have based himself only on the silliest part of comic books (Bat Credit Card... 'nuff said). - No development, at all, of the characters. Hero-wise that is a problem present even in Burton's films, but considering the number of main characters crammed up in here it becomes impossible to ignore.- To complete the screenplay, an atrocious dialogue. Seriously, take ANY dialogue from the film. Doesn't matter if you have the context or not, it is terrible. No, wait, 'terrible' would be a compliment. It is cheesy, completely lacking in the wit or cleverness it apparently believes itself to have; the terrible out-of-place jokes and the delivery makes it even harder to stand.- The cast is equally atrocious. George Clooney makes Val Kilmer look Oscar-worthy; he plays the same 'perfect' little charming pretty-boy he usually does and totally forgets what the hell this Batman character is supposed to be (the fact he keeps grinning like a loon is also irksome). He manages to upstage Chris O'Donnell in terribleness, and Chris again plays the same clichèd angry teen that acts like a kid most of the time (even worse, there is a ridiculous fight between the two because of Poison Ivy!).Alicia Silverstone... How was she supposed to be a Batgirl like that? She is good looking and not necessarily a bad choice, but looks and talks as if she was still in 'Clueless'. Michael Gough is a lot better here and, despite the contrived subplot he is in, the only one to do a good job; he is outstanding, even, by this film's standards.- Villain-wise, another crap-fest. Uma Thurman, who is usually a very bland\/bad actress to me (the only exception being in Tarantino's films), is totally absurd as the nerdy Pamela Isley and even worse as the supposedly sexy Poison Ivy. She overdoes every scene she is in, and is unbelievable in each one of them.Arnold Schwarzenegger is a joke as Mr Freeze. His success as an actor sterns from his physique that makes him a perfect choice for action roles; however, Freeze is supposed to be a serious scientist with a highly dramatic and emotionally sympathetic life-story; however, he acts nothing like that and becomes just a 'Terminator'-esque, pun-cracking goofy villain.

I appreciate unpredictable twists and turns drives interest but this presages Cary Grant's drunken drive in the upcoming North by Northwest.It's 1956-7 and someone behind a typewriter has a list of psychiatric conditions and is plot-lining these. Reminding ourselves that the first Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders appeared in 1952, its hard not to see the script team thumbing dog-eared versions for more character characteristics. I'm getting used to Mr Hitchcock's script-progressing irritating irrationality, getting the plot into peril and then extracting us from it. So often he makes us take Fergusonian leaps of faith which similarly has us clutching the gutters of credibility. Clearing the kids from the school in The Birds to name but one or the crop duster pilot not seeing the truck. These abound. The price of a classic scene. Perhaps the gutter is a metaphor the script itself, or even Hitch's hold on the film-making process. Like the ending. Where else could it, and she, possibly go apart from another 1958 industry standard bar? Mr Hitchcock went for the box. According to IMDb it grossed over half the production cost in the opening weekend so that's the formula there. Lots of magic moments embedded in a crisis of how to link them together, credibly. At least with the Road-Runner, you get a new story each time. But that's the man. The music score though benign, is the most disturbing. The syntax of the strings is aged and hackneyed (surprising for a man born not far away in Leytonstone and at the peak of his career) - a parody of the style? I doubt it. What progress in a couple of years towards the 'shower strings' in Psycho. Imaging what re-scoring this film could do.Back to DSM1. Centrally, Ferguson's frankly sexually obsessive stalking behaviour is crudely over-portrayed and uncomfortable. One wonders if JS was the person for this role. Robert Mitchum springs to mind but Brando plus or minus shirt would have done it better. Were the chaotic emotions and behaviour in the principles a crafted representation, or just very bad application of 'disorder' into standard scripting? Mr Elster must have had a copy too  'Mrs Elster' appears to be having seizures, later fully entering an apparent dissociative fugue. I say apparent as it turns out (spoiler) it was a script driven put-on. Not bad for a shipbuilding murdering millionaire(script cred logical error). Moving 'forwards', 'Doctor' validates his sanguine Victorian diagnosis of Ferguson as 'melancholia' with evident psycho-analytic tendencies. Perhaps the punters indicated they needed more info. Two years later, in Psycho, we get a comprehensive profile of Bates' condition lacking only a Christopher Waltz accent. Fear of Germs - the transmission of psychiatric disorders through shared body fluids is put to the audience, after Stewart and Novak have a suitably strung moment of mouth passion, after which he starts having her dreams. Um. Product placement moment. Ferguson also has a spell of dissociation where he briefly becomes a Jimmy Stewart character from another movie. Most likely the script team were having a go at Post Traumatic Stress Disorder after the first incident in the film. This movie has many good points like the moody dusk and dawn shots. As Jimmy cruises the streets of SF after the big green Bentley (sorry, Jag) I had a massive Bullitt replay of tyre shredding acceleration. One of those 'oh that's where it came from' moments, like men whining after a woman called 'Livia' in Italian. The brown suit sits well on the bland career cop we first meet too far up the ladder yet not far enough up to avoid chasing Liberace lookalikes a couple of pants behind an older and fitter but myopic beat cop. Oh they were probably warning shots advising him not to attempt the next leap of faith across 42nd Street onto a 45degree pitched roof. The fools.And so to the fear of heights. This left a whole generation of folk thinking that is Vertigo. Despite the handy medical lesson on the flashback set of Rear Widow where we learn this phobia is acrophobia. Followed by a well-acted demonstration of Vertigo  provoking spinney sensations via head movement (atop the Croc Dundee 'steps &#x96; call that a step?' ). The connection is?

I just picked it up randomly from my DVD store. The film is a feel good gem elevated to a different level by BARRY FITZGERALD's wonderful performance as a sarcastic and sharp tongued priest who fears his time at the church he has headed for decades is over. The arrival of a progressive priest CHUCK O MALLEY (BING CROSBY) at his church triggers a series of mildly amusing clashes between the two men even though they respect each other. FITZGERALD sort of carries the movie on his shoulders.The film has no real plot. Its mostly about (the somewhat opulent) life in the church though apparently the church is always short of cash. I thought the film would be about the clash between the church and the capitalists but that part of the movie goes nowhere and in the end the capitalists are shown as people with good intentions (even though they have a mortgage on the church?).

Because baddies want to go back in time to commit crimes, a new government agency, the Time Enforcement Commission, is formed to prevent and police criminal actions by people who travel in time. Max Walker (Van Damme) is chosen to be part of the TEC team. But since a bunch of thugs attacked and killed his beloved wife Melissa (Sara), Walker has hit the bottle and is living in the past, lamenting his lost love. But it hasn't prevented him from being a top timecop, and his incorruptible nature has caught the ire of a very formidable foe, Senator McComb (Silver). McComb has his eye on the presidency, and all the millions of dollars it takes to get there, and is willing to do anything to achieve his power-hungry goals. When Fielding (Reuben) enters the picture, things get even more complicated. Can Walker stop McComb, other time-baddies, and possibly even time-rescue his wife in the process? Find out today&#x85; It's really no surprise as to why Timecop is one of the most popular and well-known Van Damme titles. It's a completely mainstream, professionally-made product that contains thought-provoking ideas as well as classic Van Damme action scenes. JCVD gets all the best lines (90's one-liners at their best), and the movie is as solid a piece of entertainment as you're likely to find. Director Peter Hyams would re-team with Van Damme the next year for Sudden Death (1995), and is the father of John Hyams, who is a brilliant director in his own right, known for working with JCVD in Universal Soldier Regeneration (2009), Universal Soldier Day of Reckoning (2012), and Dragon Eyes (2012). So the bloodline continues.Timecop also qualifies as one of our favorite items, a movie that takes place in the future which is now the past, in this case 2004. Max Walker's powerful mullet must have been reassuring for viewers in 1994 to see, knowing they would still be fashionable ten years into the future. But were they fashionable in 1994? Regardless, Walker is the type of guy who tells purse-snatchers to read between the lines on his boot, and that's good enough for us. Of course, Van Damme does more than one split, including one that saves his life, in an attempt to show viewers that they ARE necessary to constantly do, dammit.This also qualifies as one of many movies in which there are two Van Dammes. As we always say, it must have been in his contract. The great Ron Silver was perfectly cast as the smug politician\/baddie (hey, aren't they one and the same?) His car even has the license plate SENATE, thus broadcasting to the world he's an evil megalomaniac to be reckoned with. Add to Silver and Van Damme the beautiful Mia Sara, some sax on the soundtrack, the time-honored warehouse fight, and the fact that the special effects are all wonderfully pre-CGI, and you have a winner that trumps the lackluster competitor Stargate (1994) in just about every way. And it wouldn't be a 90's sci-fi movie without at least a little bit of VR. VR was huge in the 90's. It found its way into movies like this, which don't even really deal with VR. In the 90's, VR was the future.Also slated to be the future back then were minidisc players, and surely Timecop must be one of the only movies in history to feature one. Speaking of music, songs on the soundtrack include Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is and Time Won't Let Me, in that case covered by The Smithereens, and multiple shots of clocks get the viewers' minds in the right space to appreciate the time-y goings-on.In all, Timecop is a very well-written, well-directed, and just all-around well-made film.

","genre":"Action, Crime, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"22 October 2013","score":"","review":" In the future year of 2004, time travel is possible. But since the future has not happened yet, travelers can only go back in time. Because baddies want to go back in time to commit crimes, a new government agency, the Time Enforcement Commission, is formed to prevent and police criminal actions by people who travel in time. Max Walker (Van Damme) is chosen to be part of the TEC team. But since a bunch of thugs attacked and killed his beloved wife Melissa (Sara), Walker has hit the bottle and is living in the past, lamenting his lost love. But it hasn't prevented him from being a top timecop, and his incorruptible nature has caught the ire of a very formidable foe, Senator McComb (Silver). McComb has his eye on the presidency, and all the millions of dollars it takes to get there, and is willing to do anything to achieve his power-hungry goals. When Fielding (Reuben) enters the picture, things get even more complicated. Can Walker stop McComb, other time-baddies, and possibly even time-rescue his wife in the process? Find out today&#x85; It's really no surprise as to why Timecop is one of the most popular and well-known Van Damme titles. It's a completely mainstream, professionally-made product that contains thought-provoking ideas as well as classic Van Damme action scenes. JCVD gets all the best lines (90's one-liners at their best), and the movie is as solid a piece of entertainment as you're likely to find. Director Peter Hyams would re-team with Van Damme the next year for Sudden Death (1995), and is the father of John Hyams, who is a brilliant director in his own right, known for working with JCVD in Universal Soldier Regeneration (2009), Universal Soldier Day of Reckoning (2012), and Dragon Eyes (2012). So the bloodline continues.Timecop also qualifies as one of our favorite items, a movie that takes place in the future which is now the past, in this case 2004. Max Walker's powerful mullet must have been reassuring for viewers in 1994 to see, knowing they would still be fashionable ten years into the future. But were they fashionable in 1994? Regardless, Walker is the type of guy who tells purse-snatchers to read between the lines on his boot, and that's good enough for us. Of course, Van Damme does more than one split, including one that saves his life, in an attempt to show viewers that they ARE necessary to constantly do, dammit.This also qualifies as one of many movies in which there are two Van Dammes. As we always say, it must have been in his contract. The great Ron Silver was perfectly cast as the smug politician\/baddie (hey, aren't they one and the same?) His car even has the license plate SENATE, thus broadcasting to the world he's an evil megalomaniac to be reckoned with. Add to Silver and Van Damme the beautiful Mia Sara, some sax on the soundtrack, the time-honored warehouse fight, and the fact that the special effects are all wonderfully pre-CGI, and you have a winner that trumps the lackluster competitor Stargate (1994) in just about every way. And it wouldn't be a 90's sci-fi movie without at least a little bit of VR. VR was huge in the 90's. It found its way into movies like this, which don't even really deal with VR. In the 90's, VR was the future.Also slated to be the future back then were minidisc players, and surely Timecop must be one of the only movies in history to feature one. Speaking of music, songs on the soundtrack include Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is and Time Won't Let Me, in that case covered by The Smithereens, and multiple shots of clocks get the viewers' minds in the right space to appreciate the time-y goings-on.In all, Timecop is a very well-written, well-directed, and just all-around well-made film.

Despite his sub-normal IQ, Gump leads a truly charmed life, with a ringside seat for many of the most memorable events of the second half of the 20th century. Entirely without trying, Forrest teaches Elvis Presley to dance, becomes a football star, meets John F. Kennedy, serves with honor in Vietnam, meets Lyndon Johnson, speaks at an anti-war rally at the Washington Monument, hangs out with the Yippies, defeats the Chinese national team in table tennis, meets Richard Nixon, discovers the break-in at the Watergate, opens a profitable shrimping business, becomes an original investor in Apple Computers, and decides to run back and forth across the country for several years. Meanwhile, as the remarkable parade of his life goes by, Forrest never forgets Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), the girl he loved as a boy, who makes her own journey through the turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s that is far more troubled than the path Forrest happens upon. Featured alongside Tom Hanks are Sally Field as Forrest's mother; Gary Sinise as his commanding officer in Vietnam; Mykelti Williamson as his ill-fated Army buddy who is familiar with every recipe that involves shrimp; and the special effects artists whose digital magic place Forrest amidst a remarkable array of historical events and people. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi ","genre":null},{"date":"22 October 2013","score":"","review":" Stupid is as stupid does, says Forrest Gump (played by Tom Hanks in an Oscar-winning performance) as he discusses his relative level of intelligence with a stranger while waiting for a bus.
