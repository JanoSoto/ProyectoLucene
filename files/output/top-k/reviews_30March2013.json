It stars Gary Oldman, Lena Olin, Annabella Sciorra, Juliette Lewis and Roy Scheider. Music is by Mark Isham and Gary Alper and cinematography by Dariusz Wolski.Oldman plays corrupt cop Jack Grimaldi who does favours for The Mob in exchange for considerable payments. He has a loving wife and a mistress, but even that can't satiate his lust leanings. So when he is assigned to babysit Russian hit-woman Mona Demarkov (Olin), he is soon up to his neck in sexual yearnings. Something which spells trouble for everyone...A box office flop and savaged by some pro critics, Romeo Is Bleeding is clearly not a film for everyone! Yet for those who like their neo-noir sprinkled with satire and Grindhouse flavours, it's definitely the film for you. It's possible that some folk just didn't get it, that it has its tongue firmly in its bloody cheek? While some of the charges of misogyny and it being a macho fantasy are kind of moot given it's written by a woman! Undeniably it is guilty of going too far over the top, where as it cheekily laughs at itself it forgets to rein itself in, a problem since the finale is surprisingly touching but difficult to accept given the carnage previously.The trajectory of story is classic noir. Hapless corrupt copper Jack Grimaldi loves his wife but finds it easy to cheat with other women. Once the incredibly sexy Mona Demarkov slinks into his view, he's in big trouble. Add in The Mob after him due to not carrying out a hit and you get a noir protagonist spinning towards misery. Grimaldi narrates in snatches to keep the mood simmering on desperation, while visual smarts like a triplicate mirror image - or a scene at a amusement park - further enhance the noir atmosphere. While Olin's Demarko has to rank as one of the most potent femme fatales to steam up the screen.Superbly performed by the principal actors and backed up with solid support, film doesn't lack for quality in that department. And with Wolski's photography and Isham's music also leaving indelible marks on the sleaze and greed mood, tech credits are impressive. If only Medak had not tried to take too bigger a slice of cake then this would be talked about as a neo-noir classic. As it is, as appendages are lost and the pulses raised, this still plays out as a disgustingly sexy, weirdly off-kilter and bloody fun piece of film. 7.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"30 March 2013","score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Romeo Is Bleeding is directed by Peter Medak and written by Hilary Henkin.

When the war ended there was a lot of consternation about the difference in the roles of the two European antagonists--the Germans and the Italians. That's maybe the biggest ongoing theme of this movie, and clearly the Italians are being shown as victims and eventually as heroes to the Americans once the troops start to arrive and the Nazi occupation is pushed out. This is set and filmed in Italy, and the locations are terrific. And so is the filming, nicely dramatic widescreen stuff.Sinatra represents, in almost all his film roles, a kind of regular guy who isn't overly engaged but who is gentle and relaxed and ready to do the right thing. He's a real American archetype just as much as Bogart was, and his characters (including this one) mix a compelling personal demeanor with a moral fiber that makes him admirable. He doesn't seduce the woman who really is ready to let him. He doesn't put criticize his British counterpart in the prison until he has to. He stands up to the enemy but doesn't every sound arrogant or nasty. He's the ultimate good guy and is presented this way for the ongoing reason often seen in post-war American films, establishing a national character in film characters that matches the best of what was really in the air and on the ground in the U.S. at the time.It's all pretty wonderful to watch. You admire him and wish there were more people like him around.The plot is exciting as heck. What starts as a kind of prison break movie shifts to another kind of escape and survive movie, with a train running right through enemy territory. Filled with daring, with this one American amidst mostly British soldiers, the enemy is dispatched, tricked, and evaded several times. When the good guys fail, it's only temporarily.

However, in my country, China, it received its due credit. It's somehow very much appreciated by Chinese fans, even more than the Godfather. A friend of mine was a pianist, he was recommending this movie to me all along. I watch the beginning and found it interesting, but my schedule hindered me from watching the whole movie. Yesterday I caught a glimpse at the TV show Lie to me and found the exact actor on that show Tim Roth. The show really reminded me of this movie so I decided to watch it. I'm glad I did, and I regret leaving the DVD aside for so many years.The movie was about a child\/prodigy, left on a ship by an supposed immigrant family, was adopted by a stoker. From the stoker, the boy established the notion that the ship was everything to him(everything outside the Virginian is bad). Tragically, the stoker was later killed in an accident, leaving the boy an orphan. Being on the ship long enough, the boy fostered a great interest on piano. By watching the pianists play, he became spontaneously proficient at playing the instrument. The night the stoker was buried(thrown overboard), he sneaked into the ball room and played an improvised sad piece, a piece which attracted passengers all over the ship(including the captain)to listen. Later, the boy grew up, playing the piano on the ship all his life. It was not until he was 27 that he met his lifelong friend a trumpeter named Max Tooney. Although he became a legend on the ship because of his music, he never set foot on land, let alone starting a life there. Watching this movie, I never bothered to check the clock even though it was close to midnight. My eyes were glued to every scene. The direction was perfect. I loved the idea of having Max on the voice-over, it increased the sense of epic and enhanced the consistency of the movie. Of course, the lovely piano pieces help to shed light on the scenes as well. Whenever you have exhausted your attention span, the music emerges, snapping you back into the movie. There are scenes that are still memorable even 15 years today. I.e., the scene which 1990 took Max on a fantastic piano ride in order to rid him of his seasickness. The piano duel between 1900 and Jelly Roll Morton. The scene which 1900 saw a beautiful lady and played a beautiful piano piece for him. Oh God, those scenes were so lovely. I could watch them again and again without getting bored. You really should give the composers credit for writing such beautiful music. As for the acting, this movie was also top-notch. Tim Roth gave possibly the best performance in his career. Before I saw him on the DVD cover, I gave my doubts. I doubted if he could handle a character so elegant and noble, as he was used to playing villains and lowlifes all the time. His debut in the film erased all my doubts. He was charismatic and esoteric. His eyes showed you his crave for music and his sense of belonging to the ship. His emotion showed his willingness to connect with other people off the ship even though it was a lost cause. Finally, his performance peaked at the scenes with the girl. He really showed his passion for the girl although he was a shy person in nature. At times, I resonated with him. I was also a shy boy once and the always stalk the girls I desire and watch them from afar. In the end, it was his performance in the last scene that really stunned me. Originally, I thought it was kinda lame for him not to go overboard(no pun intended). However, his explanation to Max in the later scene allowed me not only to resonate with him, but also share a few tears for him. My emotion can only be manipulated by Tim's perfect performance.On the other hand, I think Pruitt Vince Taylor gave a crappy performance. His emotion was so stiff..No wonder no one's hiring him anymore. In the last scene when he was supposed to be sad by 1900, I think his face expressed disdain instead of sadness. The guy's surely gotten his facial expressions all messed up. For those who haven't seen this movie, I strongly recommend you to watch it. This is simply an amazing movie and Top 10 on my list on par with movies like The Shawshank Redemption. Don't let the IMDb rating fool you, have some backbone for you own opinion.

Most people know this as the Jason movie where he fights an off-brand Carrie, but honestly that doesn't come into play that much. Tina is pretty much a final girl like all the others, only occasionally she takes a pause from that to move some light objects around. But even if the gimmick du jour is sorta underused, this is still one of the more entertaining Friday-flicks.

This film is something which has always been on my lengthy cinema bucket list.I am joyous that I took the the time viewing into this film as it was both uplifting and meditative amongst the chaos.The film's plot revolves around two separate narratives regarding two policemen working within Chungking,both of whom have gone through recent break ups. Their stories are told sequentially and are both running in chagrin until they encounter a new woman.For the first story, we become acquainted with He Qiwu, a man who pines over his most recent relationship with a girl called May. Whilst the May of which his relationship recently ended with has no screen time, there is plenty of monologue spoken from He Qiwu and interaction with other characters regarding her that as an audience we can feel his pain. (I mean, who hasn't been there before?) He Qiwu goes on the rebound and seeks out a girl after much self pity. It is at bar that he encounters a certain femme fatale.The femme fatale is not issued a name in this story segment however it just adds to the sense of mystery she aesthetically displays by the costume of which she wears A Blonde Wig and Glasses. It becomes quickly evident within the first fifteen minutes of the film that she is a dangerous presence as we see her organizes an illegal drug smuggling operation. When He Qiwu and the woman with the blonde wig cross paths, it is not because he is after her. It is because he found himself out at a bar on the prowl and as we as viewers are sure of, the ineluctability of them meeting together is certain. They are not united together as lovers, however there is a slither of hope given to He Qiwu after their encounter and in his current position, a morale booster.In the second story, the unnamed Cop 663 is going through the motions post break up with an air stewardess. We see that the stewardess had decided to visit a snack counter which he frequents and gave a letter to the owner regarding her wishes to break up and keys to the apartment. This is all caught by the exuberant Faye, a worker at the counter. As Cop 663 does not wish to look at the envelope being fully aware of what the letter will detail, Faye falls him for and uses the keys to start rearranging the house while he is at his day-shift unaware. From there, the story builds around the meetings between of both Faye and Cop 663.Throughout both stories there are reoccurring motifs that we take in such as expiry dates, the name of May, a model airplane, California Dreamin' by The Mamas & Papas, a Garfield stuffed toy and more which have been omitted from this review. The symbolism behind these help build the strength of both stories and also slightly relate them. The setting of Chungking is a multicultural place and in being so it is interesting to hear dialog hear dialog in Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese and Indian throughout the film. It is hard for the setting to not draw you in. However, despite the streets being as flooded with populace as they are, we are left with the contrast of the characters usually being in isolated locations. Taciturn and with a running self monologue.The soundtrack should be a key player in any film watched and in The Chungking Express it is not something which is not to be ignored. Most notably the soundtrack is dominated by California Dreamin' during the second half of the movie. The highlight song for me personally is a delightful Cantonese cover version of the song Dreams originally performed by the Cranberries sung by no other than Faye Wong, main actress of the second segment.In regards to the cinematography, it is hard to believe that shots being taken are not being done so under natural lighting. In a scene where the Indians are assembling clothes and toys, we get various cutaway shots and amazing editing. (In particular one shot of shoes filled with cocaine\/heroin being put away is shot upside down which for unknown reasons I really love) The editing is quick and fast paced, rarely lingering.Through the use of shaky held hand camera during chase scenes and the busy streets we feel disorientated and just as lost as the characters on screen. I believe this film is an equally a comfort to those in love as to those who are out of love. Don't give up.

Dale Griffith (John Candy) is a big, fat, goofy and jolly shower-ring salesman, embracing life and human relationships with gentleness and empathy. Both men must fly to Chicago for Thanksgiving, and it seems like Providence holds a constant grudge against them, from a banal New York's traffic jam to an unfortunate blizzard that would cancel out all the flights, they never get their break ... for our greatest delight, I must say.John Hughes' Planes, Trains and Automobiles sets the tone in the first twenty minutes, featuring all the standards of the comedic road movie where good old Murphy's law is never contradicted, and the manly buddy-movie where two opposite meet and the most efficient gags result from the frictions between the clumsy August and the straight white-faced clown. On that level, Steve Martin is delightfully sinister while John Candy hides behind his cheerful nature, an oasis of sweet gentleness. Both actors are perfectly casted, but it's naturally John Candy who steals the show as the heart of the film, the driver of the whole story, almost literally.I guess I could also summarize the film by describing it as a perfect combo of two Jack Lemmon's classics Gene Saks' Odd Couple and Arthur Hiller's Out-of-Towners where Lemmon and his wife played by Sandy Dennis endure similar transportations' inconveniences. As for the Odd Couple, the comparison works because there is something in both Martin and Candy that reminds of the Lemmon-Matthau partnership, something exuding manliness with a subtle softer side. And that's the secret of Planes, Trains and Automobiles' appeal, it's a comedy with a heart, such, a big heart, that it floats above all the stereotypes of its genre and elevate itself to another dimension, something I can't really describe except by saying it will be forever incarnated by John Candy's expressions in two particular scenes.The first one happens in the middle of the night, in a sleazy motel of Wichita where expectedly the two manly men end up sharing one bed, Neil's spot being wet by Dale's beer. But one's patience is limited and when tired of all the troubles that filled his night, climaxing with Dale's snoring, Neil finally vents his anger, in these outbursts of rage where the flow of words is uncontrollable. Neil's speech comforts Martin's position as a comical character he suggests Dale to always have a punch line to his anecdotes, and says he can endure any seminar because he would've been trained by Dale. Suddenly, there's a sad shot on Dale's hurt face Neil had touched a sensitive nerve. Dale knows he's too gentle, too empathic, but that's the way he is, and at least, the ice is broken, and the relationship between the two men can take a much better departure.The second face is the last one, when after a series of misadventures, Neil finally realizes that Dale is a lonely man, and invites him to spend Thanksgiving in his house. John Candy is probably one of the sweetest actors who ever enchanted the screen, at a time where laughs didn't have to be cynical and mean-spirited. And it's precisely what Dale is a man proud of his gentleness, which is both poignant and inspiring. The last shot of Planes, Trains and Automobiles immortalizes everything that ever incarnated the legendary John Candy, and it's even sadder looking at that scene thinking that the actor prematurely left us in 1994. John Hugues', who also passed away a few years ago, started the film as a comedy, but as if he perceived the emotional value of the story, he didn't let the laughs inundate the film and concluded it with the right tone. And it's for the two moments I described, that the film is more than a comedy.But let's not get too sentimental, the movie also contains many comedic gold moments, an obligatory shot of the two men embracing in bed, until Martin realizes that the place where Candy put his hand aren't pillows, the debate is open whether it's this particular line or the following discussion that is the funnier. There is also a very sweet bus trip where Martin gets a big flop by singing &#x85; what did he sing again? Never mind, the priceless look of the passengers says it all, thankfully Dale saves the day by the perfect song's choice Meet the Flintstones!, Candy is indeed a great Fred-Flintstonesque figure, as a man who'd know how to appeal to both kids and adults (seriously who can resist to this chubby face, with the elbow and cute mustache). And Planes, Trains and Automobiles never stops being funny, even when not hilarious, it's humorously touching, even when Martin is left alone, we get the unforgettable rant to the pudgy rental service agent, a gutsy moment of screen writing where the film forgets about all the cutesy stuff, and let a ton of F-bombs drop in our faces, the last one being the icing of the cake. Naturally, Martin and Candy meet again for the last memorable trip of the film, and an unforgettable climax where both find themselves driving in the wrong way. Again, the situation is funny, but it's all about the way it's shown from their reactions and perceptions. No matter how cute is Candy, at that moment, in Neil's eyes, he was quite believable as Satan.All the parts aren't equally funny, many became archetypal considering the appeal of the two comedic sub-genres, but the magic of the film is to grow slowly in your heart, to have an ability to surprise you, to always be printed in your memories right after watching it, and that's an accomplishment even 'better' movies failed to achieve. One thing for sure, that's a trip you won't forget, and its conclusion is simply beautiful.

The film's IMDb poster certainly makes it look like one. But what we have here is a film about power struggles between power-hungry people, and it's definitely not a film that would be a great example of the shining spots of human beings. The entire cast does some great work, but it's Davis who shines the brightest. By this point she's already established herself as a force to be reckoned with, but by this point I think she's surprised many to the depths she was willing to go, seeing as how this is probably one of her absolutely most despicable characters, if not the most (well, discounting Baby Jane of course). She's amazing here and it's definitely an all-time great performance.

The movie is magical and you change after watching it. It's funny but sincere at the same time. I love the god father and what he brings to the movie. It's very family orientated but that is what makes it special. CHER LOOKS SO BEAUTIFUL AND HER HAIR IS JUST AMAZING!! SHE DOESN'T LOOK A DAY OVER 30! THE MOVIE WOULD NOT BE THE Success IT WAS WITHOUT HER. It's on my watch more than twice a year list!! It's so inspiring ) ","genre":null},{"date":"30 March 2013","score":"","review":" I see why Cher won an academy award for this, she looks stunning, the story line is brilliant and she always stays in character and her accent is amazing, Olympia is a great mother and Nicholas Cage plays a very convincing role.

Hitching the rating way up is first-rate ensemble acting, first with an in-depth performances from Billy Bob Thornton, as well as with lesser known but equally able performances from Cyndi Willimas, Michael Beach, and Bill Paxton (who turns out to be an unlikely hero of sorts).The final twenty minutes is mesmerizing, with a professional editing job that carefully links together all the complex interweaving gone before, taking the viewer all the way from LA to Arkansas back country. While not the greatest film ever made, One False Move accomplishes all its goals with perfection, pretends to be nothing it isn't, and ultimately offers a positive statement about people; that's why earns a high rating from me.
