One of my favorite moments in the entire series also occurs, as Luke beheads the apparition of Darth Vader whose mask disappears to reveal Luke's own face, foreshadowing the twist to come. After Luke abandons his training to save his friends, it is revealed by Yoda that there is in fact another who can save them (ie not one but two).Technology is once again presented as potentially dangerous and above all fallible. The Millennium Falcon is constantly in a state of disrepair and never seems to work properly at the most critical times a classic motif of science-fiction. Technology is also demonized by the shadowy presence of Boba Fett and especially by the only semi-human Darth Vader.The climactic moment of this movie occurs in Cloud City, as Luke and Vader duel in a hellish chamber of smoke and red lights. Vader severs Luke's right hand (as his had been previously by Count Dooku) and reveals that he is Luke's father. Luke chooses to fall to his death rather than live with this truth but he is saved by deus ex machina. The omnipresent malevolence of technology rears its head thereafter, as Luke's hand is replaced with a mechanical one, making him just slightly more like his father and nemesis and leaving the viewer in doubt as to how the story will conclude.Criminally ignored in its time by the Academy, The Empire Strikes Back is likely the greatest film of the genre ever made and sets the stage for the conclusion of the greatest series of all time.10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"30 August 2007","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" This is the fifth part of my essay on the themes and motifs of Star Wars.The Empire Strikes Back is widely considered the best of the Star Wars movies and is one of the darkest.

This was probably the greatest cast for a movie ever assembled in terms of work the actors needed to perform in order to make the movie truly believable. The difficulty of creating such a variant cast gave the movie its perfection.The last ten minutes of the film were true triumph. I won't go so far to say that it was the best ending of all time but it sure did have a very nice finishing touch. The movie assembled a good view of the 1950s medical scene with a twist of character and plot to give it Hollywood appeal.Lobotomy was a very serious procedure which had became barbaric later after the introduction of Thorazine in the late 50s. The procedure itself had attained a poor reputation and eventually had ceased by the early 70s basically during the same time as the release of this movie in 1975. This movie didn't necessarily push the abandoning of the procedure but rather sported as a great piece of cinema and history of the medical society.Enough of the history facts though, I must get back to saying how spectacular the acting was. Jack Nicholsons best performance ever to say the least puts the butter back in the popcorn only to shine strong with the power the film has conveyed. Not only was it Jack Nicholsons best it was also Milos Forman best directorial performance who's known for other well known movies like Man on the Moon, Amadeus, The People vs Larry Flynt.In end this film has become the chief in our little tribe of a landmark films and nothing more can be said other then it was a unforgettable classic.

The start of the movie seemed promising because of the nice cinematography. However, my first doubts came when Mani (the native Canadian (Indian) friend of the main character) performs some martial arts type of fighting to save two peasants from others. An Indian in 18th century Europe could be worth a movie at itself, but Mani seems to be tossed in this movie just for posing as a noble savage, apparently trained by a Tibetan Kung Fu master. His character is an unnecessary spice added to the meal and acts as a trouble shooter in the background. For instance, later on in the movie Mani's medicine will cure two people that were given up as dead, he will fight off scores of adversaries in a way that would make Rambo jealous, and on the few occasions that he talks, he will say wise things like white men don't know how to listen to trees.This mixing of elements (18th century Europe, Indian guy, martial arts) that do not really go together without decent explanation is typical for the movie, and in my opinion the reason why the storyline in the end disintegrates. Additional elements keep on being added while the story unfolds to spice up a meal that without all these spices might have been quite good. Funny story twists may be nice in the Roger Moore era of James Bond movies, but to me they are out of place in this movie because it never shows irony. Consider following spice ups 1) Our main characters visiting a whore house that looks more like a Sheik's harem. Nudity is fine with me, but is this supposed to be country side France in the 18th century? I am not convinced. 2) A one armed man who in the end does have two arms. He just had the missing and ugly one hidden all the time. Great for Star Wars, but here? 3) And then there is the prostitute who later on seems to be part of some vague organization like the pope's secret service? Please!And there is the little things that irritate because they lack logic 1) When the marquis (a friend of our main character) has been bitten in the arm and dragged around by the beast, our hero decides in a split second (hardly looking at the arm) that it will heal. I was not convinced. Call me picky but I think little things like this make or break a movie. 2) The purpose of the brotherhood is apparently to remind the king of France that he is not almighty but God is. I don't see how mysterious killings by a beast prove that point. 3) The king orders at some point to fake the capture of the beast by having made a fake stuffed beast. Since the killings of course would continue, I don't see the logic of this. Maybe this is supposed to make sense in 18th century France?I know, I am being quite critical even though I really have seen much worse movies. I guess the reason is that the main ingredients could be used to make a quite good movie, but while you are watching you see a potentially decent meal being spoiled by an overeager cook throwing in everything he can find in the kitchen and expects that the end result will be edible.Should you watch? If you are expecting something of an art-house movie, move on. If you like James Bond, Kung Fu \/ fighting action, 18th century settings, (and are forgiving on the storyline)... maybe.

The start of the movie seemed promising because of the nice cinematography. However, my first doubts came when Mani (the native Canadian (Indian) friend of the main character) performs some martial arts type of fighting to save two peasants from others. An Indian in 18th century Europe could be worth a movie at itself, but Mani seems to be tossed in this movie just for posing as a noble savage, apparently trained by a Tibetan Kung Fu master. His character is an unnecessary spice added to the meal and acts as a trouble shooter in the background. For instance, later on in the movie Mani's medicine will cure two people that were given up as dead, he will fight off scores of adversaries in a way that would make Rambo jealous, and on the few occasions that he talks, he will say wise things like white men don't know how to listen to trees.This mixing of elements (18th century Europe, Indian guy, martial arts) that do not really go together without decent explanation is typical for the movie, and in my opinion the reason why the storyline in the end disintegrates. Additional elements keep on being added while the story unfolds to spice up a meal that without all these spices might have been quite good. Funny story twists may be nice in the Roger Moore era of James Bond movies, but to me they are out of place in this movie because it never shows irony. Consider following spice ups 1) Our main characters visiting a whore house that looks more like a Sheik's harem. Nudity is fine with me, but is this supposed to be country side France in the 18th century? I am not convinced. 2) A one armed man who in the end does have two arms. He just had the missing and ugly one hidden all the time. Great for Star Wars, but here? 3) And then there is the prostitute who later on seems to be part of some vague organization like the pope's secret service? Please!And there is the little things that irritate because they lack logic 1) When the marquis (a friend of our main character) has been bitten in the arm and dragged around by the beast, our hero decides in a split second (hardly looking at the arm) that it will heal. I was not convinced. Call me picky but I think little things like this make or break a movie. 2) The purpose of the brotherhood is apparently to remind the king of France that he is not almighty but God is. I don't see how mysterious killings by a beast prove that point. 3) The king orders at some point to fake the capture of the beast by having made a fake stuffed beast. Since the killings of course would continue, I don't see the logic of this.

As far as the vagueness of the ending (meaning the last half-hour) is concerned, those who want concrete answers in a movie with this kind of theme should 1) use their imagination, 2) watch an Agatha Christie film instead, in which neat explanations are provided for everything, and 3) go back to watching Friends, Ben Affleck's movies, or Zemeckis's pathetic Contact, that pitiful little imitation of this classic.This is not a movie for morons. So if you're a moron - and you know you're a moron - just stay away from this piece of celluloid greatness, because, honestly, it will just confuse your tiny little mind.The problem is that many morons, apparently, watched this movie, then decided to criticize its pace and story. Of course, when MTV videos are all you ever watch all day, 2001 must seem like a snail going nowhere.

Filmed in Oregon, with all of the outdoor scenes photographed attractively in sepia-tone, it's regarded as one of Keaton's best works.His dexterity with physical comedy is never better paraded in a motion picture than it is here. He's climbing aboard the train from every conceivable angle as he tries to block the path of the pursuing Union Army who have stolen The General (his train) and aims to get the message to the Southern army of the Union plan of attack. It's a lavish production and obviously a lot of attention to detail was spent in giving THE GENERAL Grade-A production values.TCM is showing a pristine print of the film, complete with good background music, courtesy of The Alloy Orchestra. Frankly, I think all the train scenes became a little tedious after the first forty-five minutes with a lot of repetition dulling my interest in the outcome of the story.Summing up Fans of Keaton will have a field day enjoying his bumbling character and all of his physical feats as he struggles to win the stolen train from the enemy.

Back then it was the traditional roles with the men doing the heavy lifting and the women in support as wives and mothers so the men could slay the dragons.Frank Capra might never have given us a populist heroine, but I think he would have loved Erin Brockovich as much as I did. Although Albert Finney is the lawyer who took on the power Pacific Gas&Electric for the residents of Hinkley, California, the legwork (and what a pair of legs) was done by Julia Roberts.The true story of former beauty queen Erin Brockovich is one of the best roles for a female player in the past ten years and Julia Roberts was so right for the part. Beauty is a start for this part, but Ms. Roberts is also a single mother raising three kids who literally browbeats her way into a job with a law firm headed by Albert Finney that lost a case where she was a plaintiff. People all her life, and probably the men she was involved with never took her seriously because of her beauty. As Roberts got deeper and deeper into the case involving toxic chromium poisoning from a plant in Hinkley, she felt a lot more self worth and very much empowered due to the good work she was involved in. As she explains to current boyfriend Aaron Eckhardt in my favorite scene in the film, when she goes to Hinkley on any her firm's business, it's not a beauty queen that the people there are seeing, but a savior of sorts.Roberts puts her heart and soul in both her work and as mother. Some of her best scenes are her domestic ones with her three kids. She's not without weaknesses, she does have a tendency to snap judgments and she's not the most diplomatic of people at times. But a good heart and a good work ethic cover a multitude of sins.Unlike so many Oscar winning films, Erin Brockovich got a March release in 2000 not a release late in the year to keep the film fresh in Academy voters minds. Obviously no one thought of this film as Oscar caliber. Yet word of mouth spread about the film and it got several nominations including Best Picture, Best Director for Steven Soderbergh, Best Supporting Actor for Albert Finney and others. And it was a winner for Julia Roberts for Best Actress of 2000. Erin Brockovich was one of my favorite films for the new century and I think it will please every one who sees it.
