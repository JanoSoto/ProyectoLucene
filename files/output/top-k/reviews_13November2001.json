[{"date":"13 November 2001","score":"","review":"  Shrek directed by Andrew Adamson, Vicky Jenson, and Scott Marshall is a magnificent animated movie.  It stars Mike Myers(Shrek),  Eddie Murphy(Donkey),  Cameron Diaz (Princess Fiona),  John Lithgow (Lord Farquaad),  and many others.  This comedy is rated PG and lasts for an hour and a half but you'll be laughing long after that.This is a story of acceptance.  The comedy isn't complex,  the jokes may not seem to be to original but they definately make you laugh out loud. Shreck is an ogre,  a mythological creature who is fierce and ugly,  who's solitude is disrupted when a talking donkey wanders into his life.  As soon as this happens a group of other mythological creatures happens to come along and take residence in his swamp.  Furious with his life being interrupted, Shrek decides to go to Lord Farquaad and demand that his swamp return to the way it was.  When he arrives Lord Farquaad gives him an offer.  Rescue the Fair Princess Fiona and I will return your swamp to the way it was.  On his quest Shrek and Donkey encounter mishaps and merry men which will make your stomach hurt from all the laughing. I don't care for animated movies that have dancing and singing,  but I couldn't pull myself from this movie.  I enjoyed this movie and think you will too.

But, lets face it, this movie didn't come close to the humor offered by Toy Story or Shrek.  It seemed to me that the characters where reaching for jokes a lot. The plot was not very exciting.  Actually, it was very predictable, you could sit through the first 20 minutes and predict what will happen at the end.  However, for kids seven and under this movie is great.

Here's the real deal Shrek-style cynicism and sarcasm are easy. The ability to look at the world with a childlike sense of wonder and creativity is a gift. It's a gift the Pixar guys and gals are copiously endowed with. There are more clever, witty ideas in any given five minutes of any Pixar flick than there are in the entire running time of 99% of the crass Hollywood rubbish being foisted on the movie populace. It's a small miracle that these folks are able to do what they do, to say nothing of the technical advances they achieve. To those who say there's no difference between the flicks, please, watch Toy Story and its sequel. The advances in fabric motion, just to name one small aspect, are amazing, and take another step in Monsters.It's the attention to detail that makes the Pixar movies so great -- detail in the nuances of how a character behaves or what his life is really like, detail in the background of scenes, even in small supporting characters. These films are a long time in the making and it's time well-spent. What a treat to be able to sit in a theater with people of all ages and backgrounds, laughing and having a great time. There are few movies for children that adults can abide, much less enjoy. Most of them are insults to the intelligence of the average two-year-old, much less Mom & Dad. This movie, full of life, good cheer, and sincerity, makes the likes of Pokemon seem even more like the drab, lifeless and uninspired toy commercials they are.

I am so glad that i went to see it because i enjoyed every moment of it!If you like Toy Story (1 or 2) this movie will definitely entertain you and live up to your expectations.  I also thought Shrek was funny, but Monsters Inc was a lot more original and adorable.  It was truly for kids, but can be enjoyed by any open-minded adult.<<MINOR SPOILER AHEAD>> When I saw it (with my boyfriend) The theater was packed with families, and very small children.  The audience's response to the movie was great, I just have to mention that at the part when Kitty was leaving BOO one little boy behind me started to cry, and it was just so adorable.  I laughed through the whole movie, and the ending was perfect.  I left the theater with a smile on my face.This movie will no doubt become a Disney classic, **** (out of 5) don't miss it!
