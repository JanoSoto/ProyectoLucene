It's a masterpiece of stunning photography, deep acting, powerful direction, and has a respectable theme about the analysis of what leads people to become people like fascists.Made in the late 60s and released in 1970, The Conformist fit in well with the inquisitiveness and anti-authoritarian ideas of the time. Bertolucci adds to the drama by bringing in different levels of analysis, most notably psychoanalytic and homophobic readings of the nature of fascism. In those regard, including the cinematography, this movie is wonderful.I don't entirely agree that this movie is that well written, however. Many people have stated that sometimes the imagery in this movie is so powerful that the plot and details start to take second place, and it's true... this movie, despite it's strong thematic elements, is mostly visual splendor. Sometimes the magnificent photography doesn't really have much to do with what is going on in the story, and not all that happens in the story is that well done.Bertolucci is known to add passion and romance to his movies, but his ideas of love, passion, and even obsession never ring true to me. In this case, Marcello falls in love with a one Anna Quadri, and his relationship with her is supposed to represent his chance to break out of his conformist tendencies and for once in his life follow his real desires. Unfortunately, Anna is not only an unlikeable character, but it never even really feels like Marcello really likes (loves) her. The romance between these two people is illustrated by highly unbelievable sensual moments that try to be profound, but hardly are even accurate. The scene of Anna's death is a gripping, powerful moment, but still I can't help but feel like it doesn't matter anyway. An unlikeable character is betrayed by a man who is unable to stand up for his desires for someone he doesn't actually like.Taking on Bertolucci's sensual style is probably like trying to nail a door into its frame with a banana, but having seen quite a few Bertolucci films so far, I've got to say that he's much better with mise-en-scene and cinematography than writing. By the end of The Conformist, when Marcello is even unable to stand up for his previous conformist principles, the imagery still dazzles but the characterization is dead. This highly famous film has the ability to cement itself in one's memory due to the photography, but the characters and story are ultimately forgettable. The imagery is so powerful, sometimes you forget the story. --PolarisDiB ","genre":null},{"date":"3 May 2007","score":"10 out of 13 people found the following review useful","review":" The Conformist is probably one of the most famous foreign films of all time; it's pretty much impossible to read anything about Italian, art, or world cinema without Bertolucci and especially this feature being mentioned.

In fact, you might wonder, what the hell are you doing watching this mainstream high-concept adolescent puffery, Mr. Pretentious? Sick and lazy and it happened to be on TV, that's why. And every once in a while, ya gotta sort of clear the palate, as the saying goes; like, every once in while I have to drink a crappy American lager in between all the fancy Belgian ale I drink, just to be reminded...Of how bad it gets. I didn't laugh one time during this piece of garbage; in fact, I don't think I cracked a smile once. I didn't expect to like it that much, but it managed to fall below even my very low expectations; some of it may just be a matter of taste, and I never liked Rob Schneider, never liked him very much on SNL and haven't ever been tempted to watch any of his other movies.Schneider plays the title character, whose name seems chosen to evoke Ace Ventura and also to rhyme with gigolo. That's a problem right away unless I missed something, the name is never explained; who the hell is named Deuce, and have you ever seen the last name Bigalow? This might seem nitpicking, except that this attempt at comedy betrays at every turn one of the cardinal rules of the genre give the audience something and someone to identify with. It's hard to think of any successful comedies that don't have at least one everyman and at least a couple of believable set pieces for anarchy and comedic distractions to revolve around. This film has none of that; every character from Deuce down to the most minor, and nearly every scene seems to exist outside of reality as well. The most extreme example is probably that of William Forsythe's cop character who pulls out his penis for no plausible reason every time he runs into Deuce.The plot certainly doesn't help matters; loser aquarium cleaner Deuce plays man whore for three weeks to raise money to clean up super-gigolo Antoine's fab seaside pad after Deuce accidentally messes it up while goofing around despite Antoine's repeated admonitions of painful death should the place not look perfect on his return (Deuce was supposed to look after it). He goes out with a succession of loser women who all for some reason end up liking him, raises money last minute, keeps from going to jail when we find out that he didn't actually f&&k any of these women (and this is one of the stupidest plot points in the movie...it comes out of left field and just serves to try to make us like the guy when there has been no reason to at all up to this point). Oh, and of course he falls in love with, and attains the least-deformed, most beautiful of his Jills. The humor is uniformly sub-sophomoric and offensive; the film is filled with an array of disabled and ethnic characters who are entirely defined by their stereotypes and who never become people despite Deuce's apparent inner sweetness and attempts to make friends with them. The word manwhore seems designed for a big laugh every time it is spoken...but after twenty times, it's pretty damn old.This is clearly not a film designed for me, though I question the taste of ANYONE who claims to like it; another proof if one were needed that the adolescent\/teen-oriented gross-out comedy is the most pathetic example we have of the denigration of commercial American film.

In fact, I had never heard of Manhunter till one late night while I was in University, flicking through the channels and this caught my eye and after I watched it, it became one of my favourite films and I became a fan of William Petersen's work.I can't understand people saying the book 'Red Dragon' is better than the film. No offence to Thomas Harris but I found Red Dragon boring and couldn't get into it. I even found myself comparing Manhunter with the remake starring Edward Norton and Harvey Keitel and found it lacking. I just couldn't get into it and the actors were rubbish and there were first rate actors in the film.This film was one of the first films to deal with profiling and it was a fairly new technique when the film came out. Up till then, crime films were the police looking at the evidence and being able to tell who had done it because the killers were caught red handed either leaving their prints behind or eyewitnesses seeing them at the scene of the crime but then more and more crimes happened where there was no connection between the victim and killer that the police could see and so they needed profilers to help with the more complex cases and they could build a profile on the type of person the killer was by looking at the crime scenes and the victims and using the profile to catch the killers.Some people knock William Petersen's acting but I think he is one of the best actors I have seen. His character Will Graham is a tortured soul who struggles to get past what happened to him when he was pursuing Hannibal Lecktor. He is now called out of retirement to hunt a serial killer called The Tooth Fairy who is stalking and killing families. Graham has to once again get into the mind of a killer and stop this man before any more families are killed and he has to do it without destroying himself like he nearly did with Lecktor. When he meets Lecktor, you can still see the power Lecktor still has over him. Brian Cox is just as good as Anthony Hopkins as Lecktor. He is understated in the way he talks and moves but you can see it in his face with sends chills down your spine as you see him toy with Graham. Tom Noonan as the Tooth Fairy\/Francis Dollarhyde is convincingly scary but manages to show a vulnerability in the character at the same time.What I found interesting was the relationship between Reba, a blind girl and Francis. I wondered if she would be able to stop his murderous impulses and Francis would have some form of redemption but it doesn't happen and the madness takes over. But it is obvious that she has touched some part of him that none of his other victims have as he hesitates to kill her at the end.Another appeal to the film is that Will has already established a career in the F.B.I and after all the experience he had, found it hard to get out of Lecktor's head but we see him get more determined to catch the Tooth Fairy and in having to deal with things he didn't want to at the start of the film, ironically it makes him better mentally. It is also fascinating to see Will as a family man because we see how his job affects his family as well as him.Michael Mann is one of the best directors. He never slows the pace and keeps the audiences attention on the screen till the very end and by then you feel like you have ridden a white knuckle rollarcoaster. Brian Cox said in an interview about Mann, he implies horror but never explains it and that is more scary as the audience are left to imagine what has gone on. The editing and special effects ain't brilliant but for one thing it was the 80's, for another, I also heard that the film was behind schedule and on the last night where the shootout between Francis and the police happened, there was no special effects guys around.The action and music just go well together, like a puzzle.For anyone who hasn't watched it, just do it because I think it is one of the best out of the franchise with brilliant actors who you can recognise in other films and TV series who weren't well known back when this was getting made but whose careers have flourished since the making of the film.

I've never read the original stories, but I gather (from other comments) this movie was quite true to them, both in the micro as well as the macro sense. To the viewer, however, it comes across as totally disjointed, a bunch of pieces that don't add up to very much together. At the end (and at several points along the way), I felt dissatisfied with the way the tensions between characters were (or were not) being resolved. And in the end, (nearly) everyone is killed, Arthur sails away to the great beyond, and we have no idea what the point of this whole exercise was? What did these knights ever accomplish? How did the country ever benefit from their services and sacrifices? Again, I strongly suspect these are the same issues with the literary sources and not unique to the movie, but all the same, it leaves the viewer grasping for something to hang on to.The film is very well made, though. Lots of good action and fight scenes, and the overall medieval feel comes through very well. The cinematography is excellent and well thought out.

Yates is also behind the camera on this Tom Selleck vehicle, but there's little here to remind one of the halcyon days of his earlier classics. If anything, An Innocent Man has about it the air of a competent but totally uninspired made-for-TV prison drama (in actual fact, this is not a TV-movie but a major big-screen release, complete with relatively big stars). It is not a bad film, merely one that never rises above mediocrity at any point.Airline mechanic Jimmie Rainwood (Tom Selleck) leads a normal life. He works nine-to-five like any ordinary citizen, pays his bills, and loves his wife Kate (Laila Robins). His existence is shattered when two narcotics cops mistakenly raid his house and shoot him. The cops, Mike Parnell (David Rasche) and Danny Scalise (Richard Young), have been holding back drugs from some of their busts and selling them privately for big bucks. They were only in Rainwood's house because of an address mix-up linked to another bust. Fearing their profitable scam might be exposed unless they take drastic action, Scalise and Parnell plant narcotics in Rainwood's house and make it look like they were there on a legitimate raid. As a result, Jimmie is convicted of a crime he never committed and sent to a tough penitentiary for several years. While her husband is inside, Kate works tirelessly to clear his name, bringing in honest cop John Fitzgerald (Badja Djola) to investigate her suspicions of police corruption. But it's a slow process, and in the meantime Jimmie must learn to survive in the dangerous prison environment. A tough, experienced convict called Virgil Cane (F. Murray Abraham) teaches him how to cope, but Rainwood's peaceful life prior to imprisonment makes him struggle to adapt to his new surroundings. After many hardships &#150; including having to kill a prison bully &#150; Jimmie is finally released. Hardened by his experience, he sets out to track down the dirty duo that set him up in the first place.There's nothing hugely wrong with the basic story (scripted by Larry Brothers) other than the fact that it is somewhat familiar. The problems with An Innocent Man are more to do with issues regarding the general handling of the film. In the acting stakes no-one gives a really strong performance; in the music department Howard Shore provides a bland, lazy score; photographically the film is totally conventional and play-safe; and in the directing stakes, Yates goes about his job in strictly by-the-numbers fashion. When thinking about the film afterwards, words like inconsequential, unmemorable, unremarkable and routine spring to mind. Nothing about it stands out in a good nor bad way &#150; it's just typical 5-out-of-10 fodder from first frame to last. One of the main purposes of the film seems to be to give the star a more hard-edged role than usual, but apart from dollops of foul language and extra fake blood during the fighting sequences, it's still Tom Selleck playing Tom Selleck.

Not surprisingly, I cannot see why. It is French, which shouldn't garnish the praise just because it is in a different language (at times, foreign language films get praise for just being foreign), the story itself is as bland as white bread with butter, and finally our two main characters bring nothing refreshing to the table. La Vie Revee Des Anges transforms before your eyes into an over-hyped sub-par film about the French depression and the absurd nature of the woman's choice. As you can see, I had trouble with this film. I didn't know what to expect when it began, but I wanted to be impressed. I wanted to see phenomenal acting coupled with a story that best represented the imaginative title, but alas, nothing of the sort occurred. Here is what I saw for nearly 113 minutes a homeless woman travels through France cheating some out of their money. She happens to find work at a sewing factory, but ends up loosing her job &#150; not before she meets Marie, a woman of the same vein, who become closer friends. I would argue that a friendship does not blossom, but instead two people searching for something different happen to stay under the same roof. The homeless woman, Isa, convinces Marie that she can say, and the two attempt to share the times of their lives. Surprisingly, they share different values and visions, so when two men enter their lives, they react differently. Then, when a random third enters, he is used to gain sympathy and skewed views from the audience. He is the flint to this fire, but again, it just doesn't gain enough flame. In the end, an event occurs that is meant to shock and evoke tears, but between the lines of boredom, it just garnishes a yawn followed by excitement that the ending credits were drawing near.I don't want to sound too pessimistic about this film, it had potential. I think director Erick Zonca can control his actors as well as give us haunting images, but when handed a struggling story, it is obvious that he cannot maintain. My biggest issue with this film is that random events occurred to two complete strangers. There was a point in this film where Zonca attempted to connect Isa and Marie as friends, but as the film continues, I can never see them as such. These two women, prior to working at the same place, never knew each other, yet instantly they were to live together and have a connection. Suddenly, they are dating two men, and anger ensues when a third becomes a part of the picture. We were missing some scenes in between that would allow us to see a stronger connection. We needed to see conflict and resolution prior to the ending, or perhaps a stronger story about both of them prior to their first meeting to really have us understand these two. I was bored, these characters brought nothing to the table. Randomly, near the center of the film, Isa begins to visit this other complete stranger &#150; of which Zonca immediately demands that we feel sympathy for. What this film transforms into is Zonca throwing random events, that with strengthening stories, would cause any audience member to tear up, but there isn't time for the details, so we eventually ... hum ... get lost in translation.I think our two actresses would have been strong contestants in this film, had the story not been in shambles. I cannot fault the actresses, though a stronger voice between them would have been helpful. Marie's love interest falls prey again to someone who we, as an audience, don't know anything about. The brief snippets of information that we are handed in this film, does not give us enough to make our own judgment. He is portrayed, wrongly in my eyes, as the villain, but for me, it was just another case of not knowing enough to make the assumption. This is the argument that I have with the relationship between Isa and Marie. We don't know enough, they don't know enough about themselves to really pass judgment. When Marie makes the choice to be with the more dominate male in the film, Isa passes judgment &#150; how could she? Did she know enough about the past of Marie or Marie in general to do so? I think not, how could she, we didn't get that satisfaction. So, this annoyed me throughout the film. Characters I didn't even know well enough, were passing judgment on others that nobody new well enough. It was rather embarrassing.Overall, I focused mainly on the characters of this film as my most irritable moment because I wanted to like these Isa and Marie, but not enough was given to us for anyone to relate to the realizations or hardships. I agree that quite a bit of poverty was happening in France during this time, but again, Zonca could have established this a bit further with a bit more detail. Detail was the lacking element which lead to the downfall of this film. The moments with Isa and Marie could have been heightened with more detail, the scenes with Isa in the hospital could have been more developed, and the final scene could have had such a delivered impact if only we cared.

La Vie Revee Des Anges transforms before your eyes into an over-hyped sub-par film about the French depression and the absurd nature of the woman's choice. As you can see, I had trouble with this film. I didn't know what to expect when it began, but I wanted to be impressed. I wanted to see phenomenal acting coupled with a story that best represented the imaginative title, but alas, nothing of the sort occurred. Here is what I saw for nearly 113 minutes a homeless woman travels through France cheating some out of their money. She happens to find work at a sewing factory, but ends up loosing her job &#150; not before she meets Marie, a woman of the same vein, who become closer friends. I would argue that a friendship does not blossom, but instead two people searching for something different happen to stay under the same roof. The homeless woman, Isa, convinces Marie that she can say, and the two attempt to share the times of their lives. Surprisingly, they share different values and visions, so when two men enter their lives, they react differently. Then, when a random third enters, he is used to gain sympathy and skewed views from the audience. He is the flint to this fire, but again, it just doesn't gain enough flame. In the end, an event occurs that is meant to shock and evoke tears, but between the lines of boredom, it just garnishes a yawn followed by excitement that the ending credits were drawing near.I don't want to sound too pessimistic about this film, it had potential. I think director Erick Zonca can control his actors as well as give us haunting images, but when handed a struggling story, it is obvious that he cannot maintain. My biggest issue with this film is that random events occurred to two complete strangers. There was a point in this film where Zonca attempted to connect Isa and Marie as friends, but as the film continues, I can never see them as such. These two women, prior to working at the same place, never knew each other, yet instantly they were to live together and have a connection. Suddenly, they are dating two men, and anger ensues when a third becomes a part of the picture. We were missing some scenes in between that would allow us to see a stronger connection. We needed to see conflict and resolution prior to the ending, or perhaps a stronger story about both of them prior to their first meeting to really have us understand these two. I was bored, these characters brought nothing to the table. Randomly, near the center of the film, Isa begins to visit this other complete stranger &#150; of which Zonca immediately demands that we feel sympathy for. What this film transforms into is Zonca throwing random events, that with strengthening stories, would cause any audience member to tear up, but there isn't time for the details, so we eventually ... hum ... get lost in translation.I think our two actresses would have been strong contestants in this film, had the story not been in shambles. I cannot fault the actresses, though a stronger voice between them would have been helpful. Marie's love interest falls prey again to someone who we, as an audience, don't know anything about. The brief snippets of information that we are handed in this film, does not give us enough to make our own judgment. He is portrayed, wrongly in my eyes, as the villain, but for me, it was just another case of not knowing enough to make the assumption. This is the argument that I have with the relationship between Isa and Marie. We don't know enough, they don't know enough about themselves to really pass judgment. When Marie makes the choice to be with the more dominate male in the film, Isa passes judgment &#150; how could she? Did she know enough about the past of Marie or Marie in general to do so? I think not, how could she, we didn't get that satisfaction. So, this annoyed me throughout the film. Characters I didn't even know well enough, were passing judgment on others that nobody new well enough. It was rather embarrassing.Overall, I focused mainly on the characters of this film as my most irritable moment because I wanted to like these Isa and Marie, but not enough was given to us for anyone to relate to the realizations or hardships. I agree that quite a bit of poverty was happening in France during this time, but again, Zonca could have established this a bit further with a bit more detail. Detail was the lacking element which lead to the downfall of this film. The moments with Isa and Marie could have been heightened with more detail, the scenes with Isa in the hospital could have been more developed, and the final scene could have had such a delivered impact if only we cared.

However, when you decide to see Giuseppe Tornatore's movie, you will quickly realize that it is not as simple as that. Malena appears to have nothing to say though her character seems to be emphasized throughout. There are lots of men who undress her with their eyes, there are lots women who would gladly burn her as a worker of iniquity. There is, however, one boy, Renato Amoroso (Giuseppe Sulfaro) who deeply loves her. Yet, he is too young to be recognized, his love is too straightforward to be accepted... In fact, do individuals have anything to say in the world of social hypocrisy and jealousy? MALENA appears to be an autobiographical movie by the Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore who patterns his directing upon classic Italian cinema artists, including Federico Fellini and Michelangelo Antonioni. Except for the sentimental background like the dreamlike locations of Sicily, music, colors, the whole movie is filled with emotions, empathy with the main character, disagreement with social fixed rules, anger towards those who consider themselves moral but none of their deeds prove that morality. Everyone in the town seems to know life to the letter, yet, it occurs that only Renato and Malena get to know real life through suffering. Malena's character, from the mob's point of view, represents intrusion, a person who subverts the established order. How is it possible that she walks, wears, behaves, looks this way? Everyone, particularly other women who already have husbands, find this behavior outrageous and disgusting. Men, to the contrary, find Malena attractive but what they adore in her is primarily her body. It is only Renato who recaptures a real feeling, his first one, his most memorable one.Why did I like this movie? When I saw MALENA for the first time, I found Renato a real character, a true boy in a puberty age who wants to be an adult at last. He starts to be after women and his first sympathy is not any girl at his age but a mature woman. There are many haunting moments of his fantasies, e.g. he is in cinema and regards himself as a movie hero who kisses a lovely woman (and this woman is Malena). In another moment, we see him writing a love letter on the lesson and imagining his serious teacher as the woman of his dreams. These moments are there for a very important reason - they help us experience an insight into his character's struggles and desires. Tornatore really manages to do it. What else did I like about the film? I loved the music by Ennio Morricone. It appears to own a special capacity to uplift a viewer into higher horizons. Since on the one hand, the whole film is a very simple, down to earth, sometimes even a vulgar story; on the other hand, however, there are moments of pure romanticism. And the music is what combines the two higher emotions with down to earth desires. As the story takes place during WWII, we are deeply in this period. Renato once watches Malena dancing to the rhythm of Ma L'Amore No and from then on, he loves this song.There are also many gentle sensual moments, for instance Renato sitting on a rocky beach and dreaming about Malena or Renato trying to come closer to her in the sleepy streets of Castelcutto. It's always a dreamlike moment for him, it constantly has that combination of desire and childlike shyness. Once, such a moment is interrupted by bombing of the city, which represents a horror of war not allowing for love. But is it only war which does it? The film proves that jealous people filled with hatred can do more harm...I also found some performances brilliant. But it is, to the contrary, not Monica Belucci who appears to be top notch in this aspect. Of course she is great in the role, fits very well but the entire story concentrates much more on her looks than her acting. We rather see her walking than speaking. It was young Giuseppe Sulfaro who made my day when I watched MALENA. He does a tremendous job as Renato, his performance is absolutely fresh and breathtaking! However, there are also things which I find wrong in this movie. I don't complain so much about some vulgarity because when we want realism, it's normal among youngster boys to talk about women with lots of swear words. Consider, for instance, the moment they check the lengths of their penises and mock their mates who are small. What I found silly was the stereotype of religious people. The film seems to put the equality mark between all those bad, fanatically furious people for whom traditional religion is the only way of life and Christians in general. I agree that the Church consists of many individuals, some of them may be odd but this is not because of Christianity but because of their wrong interpretation of faith. There are many great catholic families in the world for whom psychology, empathy, love are everyday bread. These are not those few lunatics who regard carnal desires as devil's work. So please, don't take it seriously! That is not Catholicism!In sum, MALENA is a film worth seeking out. It's made according to the rules of high class cinema, it has an unforgettable atmosphere and great coming-of-age story. It combines a simple story with art and both go in pairs at once.Yes, Renato, let us all sing the song of love in our hearts as long as there is hope in a true feeling among two people, as long as the cruel philosophy of the mob is unable to defeat those who really care.

Ma L'Amore No! ","genre":"Drama, Romance, War"},{"date":"3 May 2007","score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" There's something that's almost majestic about Elia Kazan's East of Eden. It casts a spell about the audience; the very definition of gripping. At the same time, some characters suffer because of the film's focus on Cal (James Dean), to some extent at the expense of the other characters, primarily his father Adam (Ray Massey) and brother Aron (Richard Davalos), and the primary family relationship which the story deals with in allegorical Biblical terms.Dean's Cal is a study in the self-doubt and confusion of youth that stands the test of time and even transcends the categories of cool and rebel that to some extent limit the appeal of his character in Nick Ray's Rebel Without a Cause. One interesting thing about the structure of the story is that to begin with Cal is an unpredictable and potentially dangerous presence. There's a note of fear in the reaction of his loved ones when he spontaneously begins to hurl giant blocks of ice out of his father's barn&#133; the action actually seems random to them but what we see as the audience, thanks to Kazan's inter-cutting between Abra and Aron's Victorian lovemaking and Cal's reactions to their words gives us clues to the psychology of the character. Kazan builds upon this type of device for the rest of the film, until we reach a point in the middle of the film (particularly when Aron seems to become unhinged at the possibility of going to war) where it is hard to decide which of the two brothers is more sympathetic or real to us, and finally by the end of the film the audience's sympathies and understanding have completely shifted from the normal son Aron to the crazy Cal. What makes all this reach a higher level is the fact that their father Adam still has not made the transition that Cal has made, so there's a shift in the audience's reaction to Adam's behavior and philosophies as well. We see quite a bit of his hypocrisy, but the film's focus and Cal's own sympathies never sway completely to the kind of naked derision that Van Fleet's Kate displays toward Adam with regards to his moral righteousness. Thus we as the audience can empathize with nearly every character in the film, although unfortunately a minor flaw could be pointed out in that Aron's character becomes somewhat less nuanced as the film progresses and as his dramatic function begins to subsume the more subtle aspects of his character that could have been explored. Davalos gives an impressive performance in the early parts of the film but as his character's role is diminished his performance seems to become more frenetic, as if he felt that he needed to make up for the lack of quantity in terms of screen time by playing to the back rows. Probably it fits into Kazan's more general plan of shifting the audience's sympathies from Aron to Cal, but I felt that the uneven quality of Davalos' performance was one of the film's only flaws.Julie Harris' Abra is perhaps the most believable and stirring performance in the film &#150; a pretty hefty accomplishment considering she was going up against heavyweights like the young Dean and elder Massey. Her character moves her affections from Aron to Cal at precisely the same moments that the audience should (if Kazan did his job well, which I think he did), but far more so than that, she also eventually represents the emotional bridge between the father and son. There are moments of great tenderness in her portrayal and also moments where she shows great strength and maturity &#150; her character is naive, particularly sexually, but she's brave enough to go after what she wants even if she's not completely sure what it is. By the film's emotionally draining climax, she has gone from being a girl to being a woman just as surely or perhaps more so than Cal has gone from being a boy to a man. You can learn everything you need to know about Cal's and Adam's relationship just by watching her reaction to what they say and do.I think the film's pivotal moment is the gift giving scene, clearly modeled on the passages in Genesis relating to the sacrifices of Cain and Abel. Adam refuses Cal's gift of money because he sees it as war profit, whereas he embraces Aron's gift &#150; an announcement of impending marriage to Abra. The scene is exceptionally powerful because our knowledge includes many facts that Adam seems unaware of, perhaps even willfully ignorant of. He tells Cal that only Aron's gift is honest and true, but the facts as we know them are that Abra does not love Aron, and that Cal's gift truly represents a great sacrifice and a great step forward towards independence. It wasn't easy for Cal to ask Kate for the money to start his farm, and in the extraordinarily photographed scene (special mention for the quality of this film should go to DP Ted McCord) with Cal at the bean field we see that he has truly put the best parts of his heart and soul into the effort. Cal goes off the deep end, but by this point in the film we understand his character and his history &#150; particularly the difficulty of living under the crushing burden of his father's expectations &#150; that we tend to blame Adam more for the fallout than Cal. For a moment it feels that we may be on the cusp of a serious tragedy, but Abra's understanding and love for Cal provide a bridge between the two men that allows for a powerful and satisfying conclusion devoid of empty sorrow.

But they have jobs. Preston is not old enough to have a job. However, his grandmother does send him a blank check for his birthday. Preston's Dad doesn't see it that way, though.

But as the pretty new teller Shay tells him, it is not even enough to open a bank account!Meanwhile, bank president Biderman is being asked to launder money by Carl Quigley. Biderman had some bad things to say about him in court, so Biderman will do this for him or else. Quigley intends to send someone to pick up the money the next day at 100.But as Quigley is backing out his car, he is paying attention only to the cops nearby. Preston has fallen off his bicycle, but fortunately, he sees Quigley's car in time. But not in time for his bike. Quigley writes a check but doesn't have time to fill it in. That's okay, though; Preston has a Macintosh computer at home that can do that for him. And he decides the check will be for one million dollars. When he returns to the bank, it is not Shay but a teller who looks like a lunch lady who almost rejects the check. But it is almost 100 when Preston is dragged into Biderman's office. Biderman offers Preston juice (or at least that's what he believes). Believing this is Quigley's flunky, Biderman actually gives Preston the money!And then the real Juice shows up with--guess what--ANOTHER million dollar check.What do YOU think is going to happen?Well, what does happen is very funny and includes a lot of physical comedy, most of that related to the bad guys getting what they deserve.A couple of additional details Biderman is being investigated by the FBI, and a reclusive mystery man named Macintosh is buying one of the finest houses in town and lots of toys and other fun stuff to fill it with. There are lessons to be learned here money is not the most important thing in life. Family and friends are.

","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"3 May 2007","score":"","review":" A very unusual, very unconventional film which can not seem to decide if it wants to be a character study\/mood piece or thriller. Richard Bone(Jeff Bridges)is an irresponsible, commitment-phobic ivy-league pal of boozing, hardened Vietnam vet, Alex(John Heard). Mo(Lisa Eichhorn, very good)is the troubled, sad wife of Alex who seems lost to the world as she watches her husband sliding down a spiraling emotional slope. These three characters are surrounded by the wealthy means of the rich nearby a marina whose boyhood pal is George(Arthur Rosenberg), someone who is seeing green pastures thanks to the mighty powerful JJ Cord(Stephen Elliot photographed as if he were a mighty unmovable pillar)who is a business giant with lots of powerful corporate friends. It seems that it's possible Richard saw the mighty JJ dumping a dead woman's body. Alex, enraged at the thought of any mighty man of means like JJ just dumping off people like him(this anti-establishment rage courses through his veins thanks to the war which left him a cripple..it is people like JJ who sent him over there to die in 'Nam, he believes wholeheartedly). Soon the dead girl's sister, Valerie(Ann Dusenberry)wants revenge towards JJ when Alex tells her that Richard could identify him as the one there that night. Valerie wants to take JJ down and along with Alex, concocts a plan to blackmail JJ turning him over to the police when the money is supposedly handed over. That doesn't quite succeed because Richard doesn't have it in him to hand over a letter proposing that JJ give them cash claiming he saw the man caught in the act. The film exploits the fact that Richard just can not commit to much of anything always drifting in and out of relationships, jobs, anything demanding of him. Alex is the exact opposite looking for the cause to stamp out any injustice always giving his whole heart. Interesting enough, Richard seems to benefiting a lot more than Alex..perhaps that's a statement into itself. The thriller seems secondary to the awkward friendship of Richard and Alex.Mo seems to be a chess piece between them as Alex has her and Bone has always desired her. Mo doesn't wish to give into Richard because it would be fulfilling his one last conquest. Meanwhile, Valerie enters this story and leaves without much explanation as to where she went. She's very vocal about seeing JJ hand over that money, and her ulterior motives are never quite clear. She seems to be in this story as the injured sister, but becomes very involved with the two men(..perhaps not sexually, but we really never fully know)pushing for the blackmailing idea to be carried through. When Richard chickens out, she joins Alex in the quest to take down JJ..but once she leaves this scene we never find out what happens to her. And, the climactic meeting(after a house burning leaves one of the three dead)between JJ and Richard seems rather unsatisfying.I will admit that I had problems with the last 30 minutes of the film where the thriller is supposed to develop at the height of tension, yet doesn't commit, much in the same way as Richard. The answer to the riddle..did JJ not only kill the girl at the beginning, but another character by house burning. It isn't specified so the viewer will have to decide. It does end with a bang. The film is certainly fascinating with good performances(..although, I felt Heard overexerts himself into a near-parody;he could almost resemble a pirate with the saying of, Shiver me timbers! to seal the deal.), but I felt a prolonging sadness in the material. These three people we ourselves commit to seem destined for tragedy. I guess it's just in the cards.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"3 May 2007","score":"","review":" A very unusual, very unconventional film which can not seem to decide if it wants to be a character study\/mood piece or thriller. Richard Bone(Jeff Bridges)is an irresponsible, commitment-phobic ivy-league pal of boozing, hardened Vietnam vet, Alex(John Heard). Mo(Lisa Eichhorn, very good)is the troubled, sad wife of Alex who seems lost to the world as she watches her husband sliding down a spiraling emotional slope. These three characters are surrounded by the wealthy means of the rich nearby a marina whose boyhood pal is George(Arthur Rosenberg), someone who is seeing green pastures thanks to the mighty powerful JJ Cord(Stephen Elliot photographed as if he were a mighty unmovable pillar)who is a business giant with lots of powerful corporate friends. It seems that it's possible Richard saw the mighty JJ dumping a dead woman's body. Alex, enraged at the thought of any mighty man of means like JJ just dumping off people like him(this anti-establishment rage courses through his veins thanks to the war which left him a cripple..it is people like JJ who sent him over there to die in 'Nam, he believes wholeheartedly). Soon the dead girl's sister, Valerie(Ann Dusenberry)wants revenge towards JJ when Alex tells her that Richard could identify him as the one there that night. Valerie wants to take JJ down and along with Alex, concocts a plan to blackmail JJ turning him over to the police when the money is supposedly handed over. That doesn't quite succeed because Richard doesn't have it in him to hand over a letter proposing that JJ give them cash claiming he saw the man caught in the act. The film exploits the fact that Richard just can not commit to much of anything always drifting in and out of relationships, jobs, anything demanding of him. Alex is the exact opposite looking for the cause to stamp out any injustice always giving his whole heart. Interesting enough, Richard seems to benefiting a lot more than Alex..perhaps that's a statement into itself.

This was just an absolutely astonishing achievement in symbolizing the disintegration of western society, the utter desolation and detachment of humanity. Some of the set pieces in this film could have come out of an apocalyptic urban landscape, and it's hardly a cinematic accident. Leigh's dark vision of human alienation is on full display here.Thewlis's Johnny is the post-modern Ulysses -- he's out to find himself, to find meaning, to find SOMETHING. It is a lovely metaphorical work by Leigh, where he underlines again the frustrating experience of being alive and being plagued with the capacity to think. The characters in this film are familiar to the readers of Camus, Kafka, Dostoyevsky and many other great literary artists (Joyce included) -- we are doomed to search for that which we can never find.This film is worth seeing if only to watch some of the greatest acting you'll ever see in your life.

I recall listening to the director's commentary on the DVD and Stiller commented that there really weren't that many people who saw this at the theater and he was thankful for those that were listening to him now. Little did he know that Zoolanderer would go on to develop one of the biggest cult followings in history. The humour and perhaps first unofficial grouping of the frat pack contributes to the quality and the hilarity in the film. We all know that Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Will Ferrel appear in the film but even Vince Vaughn has a non-speaking role as one of Derek Zoolander's mining brothers.Zoolander's strength is the absurd comedy, unbelievably stupid characters and more funny that it should be script. All three provide us with so much to enjoy and it succeeds because of this.Ben Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, the fashion industry's biggest model. He has won the VH1's model of the year 4 years in a row, he is really, really, really good looking and he has not equal. But this year up and coming hippie model Hansel played for pure laughs by frat pack member and Stiller crony Owen Wilson, has just taken his crown. He is the complete antithesis to Zoolander as he snowboards, eats junk food and enjoys life in a Zen like fashion. He and Zoolander are complete opposites and obviously don't like each other because of competition.Will Ferrel plays Mugatu, a flamboyant and meterosexual like fashion designer who has ideas of brainwashing Zoolander so he can kill the Malaysian Prime Minister so that they can keep their sweat shops open and produce clothing for pennies. His genius plan is to hypnotize Zoolander, and trigger him by using Frankie Goes To Hollywood's Relax, to get him to kill The Prime Minsister. It's funnier than it sounds.Zoolander, when you describe it is not as funny as when you see it. Zoolander is one of the dimmest characters ever created. He can't turn left, he is working on developing Blue Steel, his new look that is really just the same as every other vapid, moronic look he has. He doesn't understand that building models to 1\/10th the scale of something is not the real thing. Hence you get the line in the movie, What is this? A school for ants? He and Hansel have a walk off, where Billy Zane and David Bowie appear for no reason other than they can. Here they do various model cat walk moves to the sounds of Beat It by Michael Jackson. Stiller has so many ideas in here and he tries to fit them all in the movie. And more times that not they succeed.
