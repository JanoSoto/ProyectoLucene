For one thing it's boring, with much of the film's screen time wasted on pointless subplots like Mook's relationship with his girlfriend. But mainly I don't like it because it's clearly a message movie, except it's message is super unclear and confusing. For 90% of the film I thought that Mook was supposed to be the moral hero of the story because he works at the Italian restaurant and empathizes with its owners. But then at the end he causes the destruction of the restaurant, his own place of employment and the livelihood of his supposed friends. A lot of people think he did this to help Sal, but then why would he go back and poor salt in the wound the next morning? Admittedly I really didn't get it. I thought it was either a movie about a large group of unintelligent, angry inner-city residents, which was meant to show people the error of their ways (a cause that to me seemed like it would be ineffective and rather self-destructive); or I though it could be a championing bravado meant to invigorate African American audiences (a theory supported by the overplayed fight the power ). Neither of my theories felt like they could be accurate. I decided I needed to read some analyses of the film to better understand, and from reading them I've learned that.... I still don't get it. Is it supposed to be a little bit of both? The movie is so contradicting. The only two characters in the film which seemed to represent wisdom and understanding were the mayor and mother-sister. However, the mayor was a drunk who everyone hated and mother-sister was screaming burn it down during the riot. Also, I thought that the radio dude was supposed to be a good guy as well because of his little speech about love conquering hate. But then he chokes out Sal near the end. Is this film about hypocrites? The scene I dislike the most is when the mentally handicapped guy puts the picture on Sal's wall. What is that action supposed to mean exactly..... the retard is a retard? Redundant! Why would any director do that? Sal can do what he pleases with his wall, It's his wall! That's his individual right. The sequence is given heavy emphasis and seems to be stating that the picture belongs there where that handicapped man put it. In my opinion the only logical conclusion one can come to is that the rioters are purposefully portrayed as heroes after all.Mook obviously did what he thought was the right thing; clearly it wasn't.

I disagree, I think Spike Lee was saying that in the end the pizzeria needed to be brought down, and that the crowed did what was righteous and justified.

With SO much music, it's only logical that there's gonna be some padding and this flick is loaded with lousy songs... What Do You Do With A General, Sisters, Gee I Wish I Was Back in the Army. Ugh. The only worse piece of work by Irving Berlin was Mr. President in 1962 and that was truly horrid.Then there is the right-wing, militaristic theme we see everywhere in this picture. Sure, you can't avoid it with a plot device like a retired general, but the flag waving would make even Fox News fans want to hurl red, white and blue.Other things about this picture are disturbing... Vera Ellen's high neck-wear (to hide tell-tale signs of her bulimia) and her emaciated waist and legs, the ridiculous romance between a young and pretty Rosemary Clooney and Bing Crosby who was well into his 50's by this point. Bing's absurd hep-cat language. It's as if we're just supposed to ignore all this stuff because it's a big budget, technicolor songfest by happy, shiny people. Look at Bing's reaction shots and he looks like he's about to fall asleep. And watch him at the end of the film. He looks like a retired clown in that red outfit.There ARE some bright spots. The title track is one of the best holiday songs ever and Bing acquits himself well. The dance sequence with Danny Kaye and Vera Ellen is done very well and Kaye doesn't get his due in this picture. But these things just can't make up for a movie that wants you to suspend disbelief, but can't pull it off. Once something gets rolling, the next three scenes fall far short. I cringe when I see Bing talking to his old army buddies about how great things were in the war, it's just so fake. No infantry man in the history of the planet ever walked, talked or felt that way about the hell of combat. Then there's Dean Jagger's haggard, old General routine, always falling into military jargon that sounds false and hollow.

Star power alone isn't enough to make it work because this movie believes in its own falsehoods. It really DOES think its a great, classic musical. It really DOES think its funny and it really DOES believe that WE will believe the convoluted plot devices, laughable romantic scenes and terrible dance routines with Crosby-Kaye. Really? We're supposed to believe that a vaudeville team is the hottest act in show biz in the mid 50's? Elvis, Chuck Berry, Martin and Lewis and Little Richard might beg to differ. Look, really LOOK at how un-entertaining the showbiz schtick really is. Bing and Danny don't really entertain much at all. Why this horrible movie is a classic is beyond me.

At the beginning, the two boys get a scholarship to a private school known for having an exceptional basketball program. Even though it requires each of them to take a ninety minute bus ride one way every day, the school presents a huge opportunity for both of the boys; it's much better in practically every way than the lousy under-privileged schools they previously attended.The film is very restrained in making its point which is something I found odd for a documentary film; I don't watch many films like this but I thought the idea was for the film-makers to make a clear argument rather than present a load of facts and allow the viewer to draw his own conclusions. In any case, it's pretty clear to me that the film is critical of the process that leads these students to be recruited to play basketball at the tender age of 14. It turns out that the scholarship the boys get doesn't cover all expenses and so it proves to be impossible for Arthur Agee, the boy who initially shows less promise, to remain at the school for more than a year. This wreaks havoc on the already pathetic boy who has to deal with his family's extreme poverty due to his father's drug addiction and his mother's health related inability to keep a job. William Gates, the more promising boy, can't afford to pay the fee either but the school finds a sponsor to help him because of his more advanced skills.Arthur is really the more interesting character here as he is plagued with problems from the get-go and he has to try harder to get anywhere. In addition to his poverty, he has to deal with his father's attempts to live vicariously through his success. He struggles to find his own identity. For a good portion of the film, Arthur tries to copy the success of an NBA star from his area, going so far as to borrow the older man's nickname for his own use.It struck me that both of these boys weren't paying enough attention to academics or social skills as they both seemed rather immature and ignorant, particularly in terms of their future potential outside of basketball. Their academic failure is also made clear by their struggle to make an 18 on the ACT, a score that is well below the national average.Hoop Dreams does a good job of telling the story of a little more than four years of the lives of two boys; it's an engrossing enough film to make its three hour run time go by fairly quickly. The film also tells something about the environment promising athletes are thrust into from an early age and how they're sometimes manipulated into spending huge amounts of time doing something that really won't do them much good in life all in the name of making the dream of NBA stardom a reality. I would have liked the film more if it had a bit more context and scope; as it is this work doesn't add up to much more than the story of two individuals when it probably should have said more about the entire system they're immersed in. I also feel that the film-makers should have taken a stand and made some attempt to analyze the story they told, their refusal to do so looks like a combination of laziness and cowardice to me. Still, Hoop Dreams does enough right to make it a worthwhile viewing experience.

And i don't forget the cast that is excellent with its chemistry. I also thank them for accepting those flashy suits and acting with seriousness such silly parts. The story is really written by a fan because he sticks to the basic plot and adds some original ideas that enrich the characters. The sets are top and Mr. Bean as guest-star is nice, although he should have done more.The deleted scenes and especially the opening credits should have included in the release because the movie is short (83 min) and those cuts are really funny! Maybe Scooby isn't the best CGI character ever done but the soul of Scooby is here and we pay attention to the action rather than the effects!

While I do say this one was better than that one, it was not really all that much better. It was funny watching an attorney that could not lie and the bizarre things he had to do at times to try and get around it and win the case, but it was also a bore watching him with his son and realizing how bad a father he was. It was also just embarrassing to watch him do that claw thing. The film is about a man who has not been the best father in the world and has a habit of breaking his promises. So his son decides to make a wish on his birthday that his father not be capable of lying and strangely it comes true. Funny scenes abound like his awkward elevator encounter, his courtroom antics and a very funny scene where he beats the crap out of himself. The film is just about all Jim Carrey as the only other character that made an impact is Jennifer Tilly as a very nasty woman who is suing for custody of her children and trying to get all the money she can from her husband. Still, Jim Carrey is pretty much on fire for most of the film and he had enough energy to carry this film at this time. I realize you had to have a reason for him to be incapable of lying, I just did not really care for the son and the family parts of the movie. Just a matter of personal taste.

This particular château has no military value as such, but as it is used by many of the Nazi big chiefs, destroying it whilst they relax inside will upset the German plans immensely. But can this rag tag band of murderers, rapists and thieves shape up into something resembling a fighting force? Their reward, should they survive the mission, is amnesty, but Reisman for sure has his hands full on both sides of the war.One down to the road block, we've just begun.. Two the guards are through.. Three the Major's men are on a spree.. Four Major and Wladislaw go through the door.. Five Pinkley stays out in the drive.. Six the Major gives the rope a fix.. Seven Wladislaw throws the hook to heaven.. Eight Jiménez has got a date.. Nine the other guys go up the line.. Ten Sawyer and Gilpin are in the pen.. Eleven Posey guards points five and seven.. Twelve Wladislaw and the Major go down to delve.. Thirteen Franko goes up without being seen.. Fourteen Zero-hour, Jiménez cuts the cable, Franko cuts the phone.. Fifteen Franko goes in where the others have been.. Sixteen We all come out like it's Halloween....The Dirty Dozen has become one of those films that is a perennial holiday favourite like The Great Escape, Zulu and The Magnificent Seven. Which while it most definitely deserves such big exposure, it's a little surprising it's part of the holiday viewing schedules given its cynicism and amoral core; just one of the many great & intriguing things about Aldrich's testosterone laced movie. Met with mixed reviews on release, with the negative side of the fence bemoaning its nasty violence and preposterous plot, The Dirty Dozen none the less performed great at the box office where it was the fifth highest grosser of the year and the number one money maker in terms of profit to budget. Coming as it did during the middle of the Vietnam War, it was evident that the paying public quite easily bought into the thematics of The Dirty Dozen. Nearly 45 years since it first lured people into the cinema, Aldrich's movie shows no sign of age, or better still-and more remarkable-its enjoyability has not diminished.What makes it a great film, then? First off is the all-star macho cast assembled by Aldrich and his team, big hitters like Marvin (stepping in when John Wayne balked at the script), Borgnine, Kennedy, Ryan and Bronson were already names to the public, but these are also supplemented by soon to be stars like Cassavetes, Sutherland and Savalas (also stepping into a role vacated by another, this time Jack Palance who didn't like the racial aggression of the character) & stoic performers like Jaeckel & Robert Webber. While curio value comes with the casting of singer Trini Lopez and Gridiron star Jim Brown. Throw Clint Walker into the pot as well and you have got a considerable amount of beef in the stew! Secondly the film led the way for a slew of movies that featured bad guys as heroes, with that Aldrich's film holds up well as being a hugely influential piece. Then thirdly is that not only is it intermittently funny as the violence explodes on the screen, but that it's also chocked full of action and adventure. All that and for those so inclined you can find questionable morals under scrutiny and see the war is hell banner firmly flown during the nastiness of the missions culmination.Split into three parts; meet the guys; see them train & the mission, Dirty Dozen has been criticised for its lack of realism, but is that really needed in what is essentially a male fantasy piece setting out to entertain? Besides which, lets applaud it for acknowledging that brutality and atrocities were committed on both sides of the fence. Rest assured, The Dirty Dozen still had enough edginess about it back in the 60s. It's also true enough to say that the characters, are in the main, stereotypes, and that the unravelling story is a touch clichéd, but these are men that men want to be (okay maybe not Savalas' religious maniac rapist!) and men that women can cast a flirtatious eye over there's plenty of character here to hang your hats and undergarments on; appealing to the inner rebel hidden away in many a viewer. The message's in there are not sledge hammered into the story (Aldrich always said he wasn't making a message movie, just a film about camaraderie and unlikely heroes), and the construction of the action is top notch from one of America's most under appreciated directors. It's nicely shot in 70mm MetroColor\/MetroScope by Edward Scaife (Night of the Demon\/Khartoum) and features a suitably boisterous music score from Frank De Vol (Cat Ballou\/The Flight of the Phoenix).It's a far from flawless picture, of that there is no doubt, but it's loved by millions and continues to gain an audience yearly who are willing to view it on its own entertaining terms. As a boy I wanted to be Lee Marvin because of this film, as a middle aged man now, I still want to be Lee Marvin in this film.

The movie is completely shot in the high school setting with five students who are facing detention. The students are Andrew Clark (Emilio Estevez), Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall), John Bender (Judd Nelson), Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald) and Allison Reynolds (Ally Sheedy). The other two actors portrayed in the film were Principal Richard Vernon (Paul Gleason) and Carl (John Kapelos). I found the actors that John Hughes selected for this film was perfect. The location for the film was a high school and this worked great for the film. The lighting that was used throughout the movie seemed good as a school is lit well, but not too bright. The sounds reflected each scene the way it needed too. One example of that would be the scene in the basketball court. You could hear the echoes just as you would in a real basketball court. The only example movie I can think that might have some resemblance to the plot and setting would be Fast Times at Ridgemont High.This movie could have focused on a number of themes, but I feel that the theme that stood out was peer pressure. The movie was all about five students from different lifestyle backgrounds. There was the jock, geek, rich girl, criminal and the crazy girl. At first, you would not think this movie would be any good, but the use of the school setting created the atmosphere that we have all faced. Also, the theme was based on peer pressure that everyone goes through during their school years. The costumes all reflected each student's background and this allows the viewer to identify each character by looking at the costume alone. The movie was shot at a school and it truly brings back memories of high school as you watch them run the halls and you can see all of the doors leading to class rooms.I found that Bender was the main character in the film because he would be the one causing the peer pressure. Bender would start the fights with not only the students, but with Principal Vernon as well. He had dark secrets about his home life and he let it control his life. Each character in the film had secrets and in the end, well you need to watch the film to see what happens.I did feel that the film will allow any person to relate to how things were in school and the film might have been for the 80's, but it is still relevant today. The same pressure that we faced back in school still exists and this film has a great way of showing how people face it and how we can change. I found this movie to be rewarding and I was satisfied with the outcome of the film and how it kept my attention during the whole film.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"11 December 2010","score":"","review":" Please note this is a review of the 123 minute 1988 release. I have not seen the extended DVD cut.Cinema Paradiso was made for people who love movies. Everyone who frequently visits this site has one movie (maybe more) that had a huge impact on their lives. Salvatore, commonly known as Toto, represents people like us, except he took his love of films and became a rich and famous director, but that's beside the point. The film takes place in a small town in Sicily shortly after World War II. Toto's father had been killed in the war, and his mother never remarried. The movie theater becomes Toto's home away from home, and he is fascinated by the projection room. Alfredo, the projectionist in the local movie theater, becomes a surrogate father to Toto and teaches him how to work the projectors. This starts one of the most touching friendships you will ever see in a movie. Ennio Morricone's score certainly helps with that, but Philippe Noiret and Salvatore Cascio (young Toto) have good chemistry and Cascio was one of the better child actors I've seen, but maybe that's because I don't speak Italian.When Alfredo is blinded by a fire, Toto takes his place as the projectionist, but they maintain their friendship. As Toto grows up, he falls in love, but Alfredo encourages him to pursue a career in film. He leaves the prospect of a happy life in his own town for the sake of a successful career, something that many of us don't do when faced with the decision. When Toto reaches adulthood and becomes a successful filmmaker, he has not found a woman that matched the girlfriend from his teenage years, but the ending reinforces his love of movies and reminds him why he made the decision in the first place. The last scene is too good to spoil so you will just have to find out for yourself! I have to admit the first act of the movie where Toto is a child is superior to the second and third act, but the first act is so strong it really does not matter, and the ending just makes it even stronger.The scenes inside the movie theater are the highlight of the film for me. Cinema Paradiso brings people back to the days when movies were EVENTS. Young people might not understand this today, because movies come out on DVD four months or so after they leave theaters. Even in 1989, movies were not as monumental as they used to be, what with the invention of the television and the VCR. In Cinema Paradiso, when the theater gets a new movie, the whole town sees it and interacts with it as if the actors can hear them.

I have not seen the extended DVD cut.Cinema Paradiso was made for people who love movies. Everyone who frequently visits this site has one movie (maybe more) that had a huge impact on their lives. Salvatore, commonly known as Toto, represents people like us, except he took his love of films and became a rich and famous director, but that's beside the point. The film takes place in a small town in Sicily shortly after World War II. Toto's father had been killed in the war, and his mother never remarried. The movie theater becomes Toto's home away from home, and he is fascinated by the projection room. Alfredo, the projectionist in the local movie theater, becomes a surrogate father to Toto and teaches him how to work the projectors. This starts one of the most touching friendships you will ever see in a movie. Ennio Morricone's score certainly helps with that, but Philippe Noiret and Salvatore Cascio (young Toto) have good chemistry and Cascio was one of the better child actors I've seen, but maybe that's because I don't speak Italian.When Alfredo is blinded by a fire, Toto takes his place as the projectionist, but they maintain their friendship. As Toto grows up, he falls in love, but Alfredo encourages him to pursue a career in film. He leaves the prospect of a happy life in his own town for the sake of a successful career, something that many of us don't do when faced with the decision. When Toto reaches adulthood and becomes a successful filmmaker, he has not found a woman that matched the girlfriend from his teenage years, but the ending reinforces his love of movies and reminds him why he made the decision in the first place. The last scene is too good to spoil so you will just have to find out for yourself! I have to admit the first act of the movie where Toto is a child is superior to the second and third act, but the first act is so strong it really does not matter, and the ending just makes it even stronger.The scenes inside the movie theater are the highlight of the film for me. Cinema Paradiso brings people back to the days when movies were EVENTS. Young people might not understand this today, because movies come out on DVD four months or so after they leave theaters. Even in 1989, movies were not as monumental as they used to be, what with the invention of the television and the VCR. In Cinema Paradiso, when the theater gets a new movie, the whole town sees it and interacts with it as if the actors can hear them.

And thankfully they are played by the same people, Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann. But don't expect to see Jason O'Day, or any of the other characters from the first movie, because unfortunately Tia and Tony are the only characters who return, with the exception of their Uncle Bene who is again seen just briefly, this time mostly at the beginning. All the other characters are new.Anyone who has seen the first one will know that it was about two kids who have special powers which some wicked men want to use. But realistically there was really no way that they ever would've been able to, because after all how could normal people ever force people with powers to do what they want them to do? But this time, that's exactly what happens. This time a mad scientist type person named Victor Ganan has invented a device that controls peoples minds, making them so that they can't think, or do anything besides what he tells them. And it works on Tony too, who he manages to capture near the beginning. So for most of the movie, he and two others are using Tony's powers, while Tia and a group of street kids are trying to find and stop them. This makes it very different from the first movie, and gives it a totally different feeling.It takes place a few years after the first one. Tia and Tony are now teenagers and more powerful than before.Note that this section contains a few spoilers, but anyone who is sensitive to frightening scenes may want to beware of a few parts. Though the movie is rated G, but in my opinion some scenes are almost a little too intense for that, and even slightly graphic.Near the beginning when Ganon captures Tony, the way that he does it is that he actually injects him with a needle from behind. It doesn't actually show him do it, but while Tony is speaking, suddenly he faints and falls to the ground. It's then that the needle is visible that Ganon just used on him. Tony is then carried away unconscious.Later they set up a trap for Tia in which they have Tony call her telepathically and lead her to their laboratory. When she see's him and starts walking towards him, suddenly a guy grabs her from behind and covers her mouth with a cloth. She faints before she can stop him. She is then left nearly unconscious in a small gas box. She's OK though.Another thing that is rather disturbing is the fact that Tony is seemingly against Tia for most of the movie. Though he doesn't do any of it on purposely, but it's still disturbing to have him doing bad things. Sometimes he even tries to kill her. Perhaps the most disturbing part of all is near the end when Ganon has Tony pretend to remember her, and then try to crush her. To me this was quite troubling the first few times I saw it.I'm not saying that the movie is violent or inappropriate. I just find it to be a bit more intense than most movies like this.

Call me an oddball, but I'm just not feeling it. Like all Friday movies, this one is still largely entertaining for sure, but there's something different this time around. It's not just the addition of a kid into the usual mix of horny teenagers, or the fact that we see a family in peril for once--it's the atmosphere and tone of the film that feels off.The plot picks up directly where part III left off Jason is dead and taken to the morgue, where we encounter some of the most irresponsible and vile hospital workers I've seen in a horror film. After dry humping near Jason's dead body (was the setting a turn-on?), our masked hero wakes up and the carnage begins anew. This time around, the setting for Jason's massacre is two adjacent houses in the middle of the country one occupied by the Jarvis family (with young Corey Feldman playing Tommy Jarvis, a character who would go on to be in the next two sequels), and the other by a vacationing group of young, slutty teenagers. You can guess what happens when Jason makes his way from the morgue to find more kids partying on his lake.While the acting is probably the best of the series and Tom Savini returns to do the gory make-up effects once again after being absent since the original, something just doesn't quite feel right here. Maybe it's the fact that this is the first film in the series to feel so obviously '80s, or the fact that none of the teenagers are likable in this one. Among the usual group of stereotypes, we get two twins, one of whom wastes no time in trying to sleep with every male member of the cast (even while their girlfriends stand by watching), and a young Crispin Glover, who has a bit of a problem in the bedroom department. The guys exist to constantly compete with the women or pick on one another. As for the Jarvis family, young Corey Feldman is certainly likable as Tommy, and Kimberly Beck is a nice addition to the cast. There is also a sub-plot involving a character named Rob, whose sister was one of Jason's victims in the previous films. Now he's out to avenge her death.The film suffers from some odd and confusing editing in the third act. Jason seems to be all over the place with no rhyme or reason to his actions. One second he's outside, then he's up on the roof, then he's out by Rob's tent in the woods, then he's in the living room, then he's outside again...I'm not sure if this was how the script was written, but it sure was pretty confusing trying to figure out why Jason couldn't just make things easier on himself. At one point, after Jason dispatches of one of the kids in the kitchen, instead of going straight into the living room to pick off his next victim, he goes back outside and goes onto the roof to get someone in an upstairs bedroom. Far be it from me to question Jason's methods, but this seems rather impractical.The chase sequence at the end is certainly not a let-down, with Jason managing to be truly scary at some points. To those who claim Jason never ran, you obviously haven't seen this film.As for the most advertised part of the film--Jason's demise--it is good, if not somewhat anticlimactic. But of course, we all know it wasn't the end anyway.While I consider this the weakest entry out of the original four films, it is still certainly worth a watch.

I'm not exactly sure how the film was received in 1979, but 31 years later, after multiple new Star Trek TV series and movies, plus the 2009 reboot which hearkened back to the characters of the original series, Star Trek The Motion Picture pales in comparison. I was not impressed at all by this film and was very bored by its lack of true Trek spirit and style. I love Star Trek but this film was lame.

All of the original characters are back together to once again boldly go where no man has gone before. There are even some new characters specifically there for the film's plot.

This movie is very cheesy and ridiculously melodramatic. In the original series we were treated to some hilariously cheesy special effects and we got our fair share of William Shatner's overacting. Yet it was all covered up by the incredible stories that were so far ahead of their time, and yet so relevant to the time period.

The film took forever to get anywhere. The first half hour is the reintroduction of Kirk and then the slow sweeping shots of the Enterprise that last forever and pan over every single nook and cranny of that ship. Now, this I can understand because for people of the time period Star Trek The Motion Picture was a nostalgic trip down memory lane. It was the first new image of the Enterprise anyone had seen for ten years, so I can't blame the filmmakers for quenching any and all thirsts for new images of the glamorous ship. But after we are reintroduced to all our beloved characters and the movie really gets going, it loses all its momentum and only shuffles along.Star Trek The Motion Picture is what it is.

The film takes place in 1916 France.General Paul Mireau (Macready) is ordered by a superior general to take an area known as the Anthill in his sector which is currently under German control. At first Mireau declines because the mission is impossible but when the superior general says how he may be considered for a promotion Mireau goes through with the action. Mireau personally supervises Colonel Dax's (Douglas) attack on the German controlled territory but when Dax's troops do not even make it out of the French trenches Mireau orders that the French artillery fire on their own men to motivate them. When the battery Captain refuses to do so without a written order the general does not pursue the option but instead decides to try three men from under Dax's command for cowardice which is punishable by death.The screenplay by Stanley Kubrick, Calder Willingham, and Jim Thompson is superb. The characterization of General Mireau and Colonel Dax are both great and by the end of the film you know the two for exactly who they are. Also you get quite attached to the men that are tried for cowardice and hope for them all the way to the end. What makes this film different from most other war films is that there is no action in it after the attack on Anthill. It is part courtroom drama as well and this film is much more than it appears. Also I absolutely loved the ending which featured Stanley Kubrick's future wife, the only female in the entire film and his wife until he died in 1999.Stanley Kubrick is often called one of the greatest directors of all time and this film shows why he is. The shot that I absolutely loved was a long shot of General Mireau travelling the trenches and greeting several soldiers on his path before the attack on Anthill. Nothing makes me happier than seeing a beautiful long shot like that, and by long I mean that it lasts for a long time not that it is far away. Also when Colonel Dax is on the battlefield the shots of him are absolutely mesmerizing, the fact that this film was completely ignored by the Academy Awards is just a shame on their part. Throughout the film there are plenty of more wonderful shots, one is towards the end with a bunch of soldiers in front of a large building, I won't describe what is happening because it is a spoiler. I personally believe that Kubrick is the greatest director of all time and obviously that is arguable but I believe everyone who respects film understands that Kubrick is a genius and this film is just one of the many examples why.Kirk Douglas gives a very powerful performance in this film. He is very strong and military like and deserves much praise for his performance. When he gives his strongest performance is when he confronts General Mireau or General Broulard at the end of the film. Also, when Douglas is leading his men on the battlefield he does a very good job. The only problem with Douglas's character is that he is kind of one dimensional. He is a man who believes in justice and truth, not in politics. Truly a man that a person can look up to. But that is basically it, but that is all he needs to be because even though he is the lead the supporting characters take up a large part of the eighty seven minute film. This is the first of two films that Douglas works with Kubrick, the other being Spartacus, and the two are a great team.George Macready also gives a great performance except his character is the exact opposite of Douglas's, he is a selfish, despicable man. But Macready plays the part extremely well. Whenever him, Colonel Dax, General Broulard, or all of them together all three of them give their best performances. The look of Macready's eyes is what really makes his performance so powerful, his stare can break a person's will. Also, when Macready was at the battle of Anthill ordering the artillery to fire on his own men his devious performance was fantastic as well.Overall I give this film a 9\/10, it is another Kubrick classic. Everything about it was great, and what I love about Kubrick's films is that he never uses music to tell the audience how to react to what is happening on the screen. He lets them feel how they want to feel. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys war or courtroom dramas. It definitely is a must see just for Kubrick's direction.

I know that the idea is that she hasn't had much education but I don't understand how anyone her age could possibly be as stupid as she is, especially given her close relationship with her supposedly well-educated father. The other interesting thing about the film is that it portrays the traditional masculine cowboy in a negative light, instead favoring this character's non-violent intellectual brother.So at first I was annoyed by how stupid Pearl is but eventually I started to understand where they were taking this idea. We're meant to see her develop from a typically weak and powerless female living in a pre-feminist society to an empowered but conflicted heroine. I still think that exaggerating her ignorance to such a degree was a big mistake on the part of the filmmakers and actually even her development feels like what it is, a contrivance of the plot to lead to a climactic showdown.Lewton McCanles fits into the typical hard-riding alpha male archetype that's so familiar from countless other Westerns. Instead of possessing a rough hewn morality, though, he's really a terrible person who seems to delight in causing trouble for others. The real problem with this character is that he has no nuance, he's very predictable and uninspired. His brother also falls into an unsurprising pattern fairly quickly but his role as the one truly admirable character is surprising given his lack of willingness to do whatever it takes to beat the villain. This is where the snubbed heroine's interesting side comes in as she eventually seems to realize that she has to put a stop to the villain's reign of terror before he makes things even worse than they already are.What I really liked about this film was the sense of the inescapability of the past of the characters. Mrs. McCanles's choice of husband pretty much destroys her life and her unresolved feelings for another man sow the destruction of her family both from the conflict within the nuclear family itself and without from her other suitor's daughter.

I recommend this to anyone open to it, and mature enough to deal with it(no one not at least in their teen years). 8\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"11 December 2010","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Bus Stop (1956) \/ Cinemascope and Technicolor \/ Directed by Joshua Logan \/ Written by George Axelrod \/ Based on the 1954 Broadway play by William Inge \/ First viewing 12\/11\/2010* * * Film* * * 1\/2 Acting performance of Marilyn MonroeGood writing, most of the way through, along with Marilyn Monroe and Don Murray's exceptionally fine acting performances, make this comedy-musical with heart, worth watching. The story concerns a young cowboy named BoRegard (Murray), traveling from Montana with his father, to Arizona, to participate in a rodeo. When he first sees Cherie (Monroe), performing at a saloon in town, he's immediately smitten and begins his aggressive romantic pursuit of her. The chance encounter love story begins innocently and playfully enough, but slowly turns dark and frightening, as questions are raised about the character and true intentions of this wild, young, headstrong cowboy.The film is entertaining and often heartfelt, but unfortunately, gives in to, what I felt was an artificial and unconvincing happy ending, that really didn't fit the tone and direction of the story or it's two main characters. Adding a happy ending was part of the movie production code of the time. On the other hand, the ending sequence, by itself, was done beautifully (heartfelt and redemptive) and contains Marilyn's best acting of the film, along her monologue on the bus scene. This beautiful romantic and redeeming ending did not really belong in this particular movie. On the whole, the ending sequence was a poor choice, weak, too easy fit and a significant disappointment I had with the film.Marilyn Monroe gives a genuinely sweet, sincere, sensitive, convincing and charming performance as Cherie, a young and naive saloon singer from Arkansas, complete with rural accent. Cherie, (pronounced Sherie), is literally on a straight as an arrow course from her home in Arkansas, westward towards Hollywood and Vine. Newcomer Don Murray is quite good as the wild, immature, young cocky cowboy from Montana. For the conservative standards of their time, the roles of Monroe and Murray were daring. For Marilyn Monroe fans, this film is a must see, to experience the quality of acting she was capable of achieving.Director Logan was a supporter of the Lee Strasberg method style of acting and also respected and admired Monroe as an actress. He campaigned for Monroe to receive an Oscar nomination for her performance in Bus Stop, which she did not receive. To me, Monroe's performance in this film was worthy of an Oscar nomination.People who have seen the film usually mention the negative impression left by the young cowboy character. Today, the behavior of this young cowboy would very much be considered stalking. Also, the film version makes it clear he is kidnapping Cherie. The screenplay (sidesteps) and plays these two plot points down, which is a bit bewildering to a more modern audience. People's reactions of the time seemed ignorant or possibly naive, about how this cowboy was treating the saloon singer. One other weakness of the film was not giving more back story to the cowboy. The change of heart at the end, was too much, too fast. BoRegard was written to be unlikable from the beginning (loud, aggressive, boisterous, without manners). Although he seemed to redeem himself a little at the end, I definitely had reservations remaining about this man. Cherie was, literally, swept off her feet by him in the end and we (the audience), can only hope she made a wise choice to go with him , would be able to escape or quickly end the relationship, if it became abusive or dangerous.Monroe and Murray each have the best written characters in the film. This was Marilyn's first film made under her new production company Marilyn Monroe Productions. Marilyn Monroe was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for her role as Cherie in Bus Stop, but did not win. With the exception of the well written dark psychological drama The Misfits (1961), Marilyn's remaining films would be comedies and musicals. Had she lived beyond 1962, I believe Monroe would have been able to shed the dumb blond persona placed upon her and finally gain some widespread respect and critical acclaim as a dramatic film actress, something she very much wanted. The big changes yet to come, of Hollywood movie making during the 1960's, would have definitely favored Monroe's professional dreams, goals and wishes.Monroe was naturally intelligent, inquisitive, sensitive, vulnerable and charming. A natural born actress. She had a surprisingly good sense of humor, including the ability to laugh at herself. She had serious interest to become a respected dramatic actress and studied at the prestigious Lee Strasberg school of method acting in New York City, during the 1950's. Bus Stop clearly shows Marilyn learned and benefited, from studying the method style of acting with Strasberg. In Bus Stop, Marilyn shows a new maturity as a dramatic actress. Marilyn was a pioneer, pushing the limits of her time and demanded better compensation and more respect for young, unestablished, but financially successful film actors. She had plenty of determination to succeed and be respected in her acting career. Unfortunately, Marilyn got stuck in dumb blond roles, not of her own choosing. Film audiences were less sophisticated back then. Once Marilyn achieved legendary pop\/sex icon status by 1953, the movie audiences of her time strongly favored and preferred seeing her in comedies and musicals only. Marilyn had to fit the persona cast upon her by Hollywood and the film going public of her time. During the 60's, the long reign of the mighty studio system, ruled by iron fisted production chiefs, finally came to an end, along with the end of the outdated, religious and conservative moral production code and The Legion of Decency.

He was supposed to go down for thirty years, but thanks to the hard work of his lawyer, David Kleinfeld, he gets out in five. He vows that he will not return to his life of crime and intends to go straight from now on. This, as we discover, proves a little harder than Carlito at first thinks. Things have changed a lot on the streets in the five years he's been inside, but there are still some of his old associates about. Carlito has a plan, a plan that depends on him getting his hands on $75,000. The trouble is there are not very many legitimate ways to get your hands on that kind of cash. David Kleinfeld sets him up with a job, running a night club that he has a stake in and, at first, things seem to be running OK. He re-kindles the relationship with his ex-girlfriend, Gail, a dancer, and she is keen for him to go straight also. But then he is slowly dragged back into the world he is trying to escape by David and the colourful company he has dealings with.
