My masochistic side pricking my conscious, I duly recording this and settled down today to watch what must be the strangest piece of casting I think I've ever seen.The Muscles From Brussels plays Chris Dubois, a ragamuffin street thief operating a child gang on the streets of New York in 1925. But after one daring escape from the police too many, Dubois inadvertently stows away and finds himself far from home and at the mercy of vicious pirates. Eventually, he is rescued by dashing British adventurer Lord Dobbs (Moore) and his partner-in-crime Smythe (Jack McGee) and they agree to help Dubois return to America. But Dobbs betrays Dubois and leaves him stranded in the Muay Thai Islands where his adventures really begin. He soon finds himself thrown into a global fighting tournament against the best in the world but as his paths cross with fellow Americans Maxie Devine (James Remar) and journalist Carrie Newton (Janet Gunn), Dubois realises he must win the tournament or risk all their futures...I can't comment on this film's similarity with the earlier Bloodsport because that film has somehow passed me by. What I will comment on is the alarming similarity to another Van Damme flick, the frankly forgettable AWOL Absent Without Leave. I can't help but feel that for his directorial debut, Van Damme should have stretched himself a bit more beyond the tired fighting tournament plot. He probably was too busy dominating proceedings - once the film's second half begins, the fighting takes over completely and dialogue fades into the odd shout and macho grunt. Yes, there are odd bits and pieces of plot to get through such as the moment when an opponent makes an enemy of Dubois and we then know who's gonna get beaten up last. It's as though JCVD felt that the cast weren't trying and decided to run the rest of the film himself.

It's poorly directed with lots of needless slow motion, incoherent and offers little surprises other than the bizarre combination of its two lead stars.

The movie focuses on the military mission of the USS Alabama, a nuclear submarine whom duty is to launch missions back into Russia if war breaks out. The submarine is split in conflicting opinions and wills between the seasoned commanding officer Captain Frank Ramsey (Gene Hackman) and the new executive officer Lt. Ron Hunter (Denzel Washington) on the interpretations of an order to launch their missiles. In the nuclear world, the true enemy is war itself. The movie has this 'Mutiny of the Bounty' feel to it, as the audience is swept into a very plausible scenario between Hunter's more analytical, cautious approach, as opposed to Ramsey's more impulsive and intuitive approach to the mission. Great acting from both of them. I love the exchange between Hackman and Washington on the topic of Lipizzaner horses and Von Clausewitz' view of war. Indeed, all the actors have their moments to shine, including Viggo Mortensen, James Gandolfini and an excellent George Dzundza. The movie is a great suspense with an amazing music score by Hans Zimmer. The heavy use of synthesizers in place of traditional orchestral instruments sound chilling like an old Gothic church's choirs. The well-known naval hymn, Eternal Father, Strong to Save is given an new spin into it. It's great to note that Harry Gregson-Williams help with the bass thumbing. Great to hear on large speakers the score. The movie has excellent visuals for a smart and tense film. Now to the faults of the film, while Richard Hendrick wrote the novel, he probably knew little about submarines as a lot of the real life Navy's submariners didn't like the film. The movie had many breaches of naval protocols that it became too unrealizable to them. Example are such like Supply Officers are restricted, and cannot be put into a position to where they could take command. They don't have the training to do so. The real life Navy regulations would have Hunter disciplined for insubordination and replaced with another XO no matter what happen on the boat. Still, I like the submarine lingoes, even if I didn't understand them. Both Washington and Hackman play stereotypical roles to the point, it's seem more about a race issue between Black VS White, than an issue about launching nuclear weapons. Who brings up semi-racism likes comments like what color the most trained horse are? Was the racial subtext, necessary? The way, Denzel Washington talks to his subordinates as if they are children is a bit odd. I wouldn't have thought for once a Star Trek or a Silver Surfer reference was going to be in this type of film. Don't get me wrong, it's cool to hear it, but I would love for the movie in those scenes to be taking more serious. What part of the Navy allows a dog on submarine unless it's a K9 unit? Even if you're the captain, I doubt you can bring a dog to pee everywhere. Forget about Tide. Even Clorox could not clean up that mistake. Overall Crimson Tide is a great movie. Worth watching.

Indeed, all the actors have their moments to shine, including Viggo Mortensen, James Gandolfini and an excellent George Dzundza. The movie is a great suspense with an amazing music score by Hans Zimmer. The heavy use of synthesizers in place of traditional orchestral instruments sound chilling like an old Gothic church's choirs. The well-known naval hymn, Eternal Father, Strong to Save is given an new spin into it. It's great to note that Harry Gregson-Williams help with the bass thumbing. Great to hear on large speakers the score. The movie has excellent visuals for a smart and tense film. Now to the faults of the film, while Richard Hendrick wrote the novel, he probably knew little about submarines as a lot of the real life Navy's submariners didn't like the film. The movie had many breaches of naval protocols that it became too unrealizable to them. Example are such like Supply Officers are restricted, and cannot be put into a position to where they could take command. They don't have the training to do so. The real life Navy regulations would have Hunter disciplined for insubordination and replaced with another XO no matter what happen on the boat. Still, I like the submarine lingoes, even if I didn't understand them. Both Washington and Hackman play stereotypical roles to the point, it's seem more about a race issue between Black VS White, than an issue about launching nuclear weapons. Who brings up semi-racism likes comments like what color the most trained horse are? Was the racial subtext, necessary? The way, Denzel Washington talks to his subordinates as if they are children is a bit odd. I wouldn't have thought for once a Star Trek or a Silver Surfer reference was going to be in this type of film. Don't get me wrong, it's cool to hear it, but I would love for the movie in those scenes to be taking more serious. What part of the Navy allows a dog on submarine unless it's a K9 unit? Even if you're the captain, I doubt you can bring a dog to pee everywhere. Forget about Tide. Even Clorox could not clean up that mistake. Overall Crimson Tide is a great movie. Worth watching.

The movie focuses on the military mission of the USS Alabama, a nuclear submarine whom duty is to launch missions back into Russia if war breaks out. The submarine is split in conflicting opinions and wills between the seasoned commanding officer Captain Frank Ramsey (Gene Hackman) and the new executive officer Lt. Ron Hunter (Denzel Washington) on the interpretations of an order to launch their missiles. In the nuclear world, the true enemy is war itself. The movie has this 'Mutiny of the Bounty' feel to it, as the audience is swept into a very plausible scenario between Hunter's more analytical, cautious approach, as opposed to Ramsey's more impulsive and intuitive approach to the mission.

While the critics (particularly Gene Siskel) highly praise this picture and call it a wonderful children's fantasy, the audiences don't seem to care much for it. Maybe it's because this picture may be too weird for them like many of the films made by Tim Burton, who's one of the film's producers. Personally, I don't know what to make of this film even after seeing it plenty of times except that I can see where both sides are coming from. We follow a young British boy named James (Paul Terry) whose parents were killed by a rhinoceros (don't ask how or why since the picture never explains that). He's forced to live with his two despicable aunts (Miriam Margolyes, Joanna Lumley) where he has to do all kinds of chores (he practically does more work than those two ever seem to do in five seconds), and be humiliated in more ways than one. One day, a mysterious man (Pete Postlethwaite) who knows more than just his name gives James a bag of magical crocodile tongues, which he claims will help put some happiness into his sad life. But when James accidentally lets these magical tongues loose, James and his aunts soon discover a peach on a dead tree that grows so gigantic that it's even bigger than the tree from which it grew on. The aunts plan on using their giant peach as a tourist attraction so they can make good profits off of their discovery, while James still has to continue doing chores. One night, James crawls inside a large hole in the peach and discovers a group of human-sized bugs including a grasshopper (Simon Callow), a centipede (Richard Dreyfuss), an earthworm (David Thewlis), a spider (Susan Sarandon), a ladybug (Jane Leeves), and a glowworm (Miriam Margolyes). Like James, they dream of getting out of his aunt's place in England and heading to New York City where his parents always dreamed of going. And that's exactly what they do through a series of elaborate, fanciful scenarios such as rolling away into the Atlantic Ocean, using Miss Spider's silk to capture and tie a hundred seagulls to the peach stem so the peach can fly, and battling a mechanical shark and skeleton pirates under the icy seas of the Arctic Ocean. Whether you like this children's fantasy or not, there are certain things about the film that you got to give it credit for. For one thing, regardless of how implausible the story can be most of the time, I do respect the creativity and the imagination that was incorporated into this story. I admire how this film had the courage to simply let its imagination run wild regardless of our skepticism and our knowledge that no such scenarios could take place in real life. The stop-motion animation is impressive in its own right particularly with the highly detailed and imaginative character designs. The voice-over work from the likes of Simon Callow, Richard Dreyfuss, and Susan Sarandon are very well done and truly bring these characters to life. The songs by Randy Newman, with the exception of My Name is James which I thought had embarrassing lyrics, are pretty solid with the standouts being Family and Good News. Like much of the best films made by the Disney Company, the strength of the film lies in the visuals and the audio. Now, I will say that the storytelling in this film isn't very consistent and is filled with major plot flaws that can't be glossed over. For example, I think that the film's writers made the aunt characters way too evil. If any parents of a child knew they had relatives who treated children the way these two aunts did, they shouldn't have even allowed custody of the child to these people in the first place. Let me put this in another way. Anyone who has relatives who taunt a child over the death of their parents or starve the child to death by feeding them non-food shouldn't just simply pretend they don't exist. They need to have an intervention with them immediately for the benefit of the child. There are also some scenes that don't really go anywhere story wise. For example, the dream sequence with James as a caterpillar being chased by his aunts and the rhino that killed his parents is pretty pointless. To be fair though, there have been dream sequences in other films that are much worse than this, and they at least prepare us ahead of time for that type of scene. While the battles between the shark as well as the underwater skeleton pirates are decent, they both go by a little too quickly and don't leave much of an impact. As long as you leave your common sense and logic out the door, James and the Giant Peach will fill the bill just fine as far as family entertainment goes. Kids and adults can admire the creativity of the story, the unique animation in the vein of The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), the colorful characters including the centipede and the grasshopper, and maybe find one or two good tunes out of it as well.

This film is literally looking at the previous two and saying how do we round this up? In its own right, however, this film is a good movie.Firstly the re-edited version (DVD and Blu-Ray) are horrible. The band performing in Jabba's Palace are so ridiculous Jar-Jar delivering a political speech would get less laughs. The older version actually sounded like it could've been a foreign language. The new version sounds like baby talk. Its so bad, in comparison, I can take the Ewoks. On that subject, if you have the DVD's at home and those are your only versions, go on youtube and look up Sebastian Shaw at the end of this film as a ghost. That makes a lot more sense than Hayden Christensen being there.The plot is that Luke goes onto a new Death Star to face Darth Vader and The Emperor and kill them. The others go to Endor to remove the shield on the Death Star so they can blow it up.My favourite part of this film is when Luke finally takes his father down. The music is perfectly suiting and the madness that Hamil puts into those few seconds are well worth the watch. The entire fight is actually worth the watch. It is over an hour long but it is the most entertaining thing in this film.Overall this is the worst of the original trilogy, no matter what version you look at but its still a good movie on its own.

And, for the first, I had to choose my favourite film of all time, Braveheart. Firstly, I must start by saying that this will probably be a very biased review. By no means do I think this is the best film of all time. For me, that would be the Godfather (all parts &#x96; It's one big ass film, not to be judged in parts) but the reason for Braveheart being my favourite film of all time, is purely due to the fact that it is the film I have watched the most during my life probably around 50+ times.Secondly, the film received 1995 Best Picture and many other awards and nominations. At that time (1995) I was only 5 years old&#x85; Now I don't think I saw this film first when I was five. But I am pretty sure I watched it while I was in primary school, aged around 7 or 8. It was my Dad's way of teaching me history, his way of bonding. He was born in Scotland and I was born in England; therefore, he felt a need to educate me that the English are pigs. It was a bad history lesson though, as the film does not pay particular interest to being historically accurate, other than stating that Scotland and England had a bit of a bloody history together.Thirdly, at that young age of being easily impressed and all things coming new to me, this film blew me away. It had me interested from the beginning, it had me gripped on the plot line, it had me believing in the characters, it had me screaming inside for freedom and justice and it had me in tears at the end. Now I'll be honest, I didn't cry the first time. I was a young boy and loved the real grit and rawness of the violence and battle scenes. The violence and the battle scenes were sprung from the pain and anguish of young lovers having their right to love stripped away with a clean cut of the knife. But this is predominantly a man's film, filled with blood, violence and hairy men. The love scenes between Wallace and the Princess are clearly just an extra bit of intrigue and probably placed there to keep the partners of the men at least thinking it's all about love. In truth, though, this film is all about violence, standing up for what you believe in and fighting for your right to live. If this film had been all action and not split up with love scenes would it have been any worse? I think not. It is, in reality, almost one long film of battles. But the side plot of secret lovers and other plots (fathers and their sons) do help to give the viewer some time to catch a breath before the next beautiful battle. And that is truly what this film is. A bunch of beautiful battle scenes. So let's begin. . . Braveheart, for its time, seemed to come out of nowhere, with visually stunning and very, very, very real looking battle scenes. From the horses being impaled, to the legs being lopped off and even that sharpened wooden stake being stuck up some poor English pig's throat&#x85; The soundtrack throughout keeps your heart beating and the sound effects of the groans and thuds and clangs and twangs of swords keeps the hairs rising and the blood curdling. From beginning to end you are at the edge of your seat, gripping to hold on and rooting for William Wallace and Scotland to be victorious. Alongside Mel Gibson (William Wallace) you have Patrick McGoohan (Longshanks) who displays a truly powerful performance as the tyrant, King Edward I. You believe in him from the beginning and want to stab him in the back as soon as you realise what kind of man he is. Then there is Sophie Marceau (Princess Isabelle) not just a pretty face but with the acting ability to complement. Is she more beautiful than Catherine McCormack (Murron)? I think not. They are both beauties and they both have a power over Wallace and the audience alike with their phenomenal performances. There are also many other great actors\/actresses to be seen in this film &#x96; Brendan Gleeson, Tommy Flanagan, though I shan't comment on them all for fear of the word count and blabbing too much! This leaves me really with only one thing left to express an opinion on. And this is probably where I come out of the closet. HA, I joke. But, seriously Mel Gibson in this film, even with a wee bit of a dodgy Scottish accent, simply blows you away with his performance. As he is the main character as well as the director it is clear he truly had a real passion for the making of this film and that is shown throughout in his superb acting. He does everything he needed to do to have you believing in him and (as I got a bit older&#x85; and clearly more sensitive&#x85;) even crying at the end. When he looks out about the crowd who are watching his execution and somewhat smiles as the axe comes down, the handkerchief falls out of his hand as he holds the gaze of his 'original' lover's eyes (Murron)... It may be true to say I pretty much idolised Mel Gibson after this film. I wanted to be (as a young boy with not much to do with my days) William Wallace, fighting for what I believed to be right, fighting the English. And I did spend a fair few days in the garden attacking weeds and trees with wooden sticks&#x85; The powerful performance of Braveheart is relived inside you. That's it. It's simply one of those films that, no matter what happens, you will always take with you.

Side effects, Traffic, Oceans's eleven and Out of sight may be the ones I liked the most from them. Solaris, Contagion and Magic Mike, for example, are normal while Lies, sex and videotapes is bad in my opinion. Finally, Erin Brockovich surprised me and I really enjoyed it. It is based on real events. It is biographic. The story is about a young mother who begins to work as a legal assistant. I did not know anything about the real character, but Julia Roberts portrays the best performance in her career, or at least, one of the best ones. Aaron Eckhart plays the part of his new boyfriend (very correct, as well). The other secondary actors did a more than decent job. Performances are clearly a strong point in this movie. The pace is adequate, as well, taking into account it is a realistic biographic courtroom drama. The lentgh is the proper one, so we can say the director has done a very good job. There are also some good dialogues and funny situations because, although the movie is a drama, it contains some humour. The movie is not excellent, but it is very correct in every aspect.

This movies contains too much violence for nothing. The use of violence in movies is understandable but I'm not fond of this overdose, I do not appreciate it a all. Of course, this is a huge problem with movies, ESPECIALLY with the Hollywood movies. Violence in films effects society as not all people can draw the line. Tarantino do not spare extra crime in his movies, and Pulp Fiction is not an exception. The most ridiculous thing is that in a way the violent characters looks cool and fun, some of them get away with murder as if it's a part of a romantic-sweet-meaningful episode in their cool lives (as in Bruce Willis character). It's a shame this movie is on top of the pack with its score here. Wish u peace & love everyone.

Seven used imagery and your ability to imagine the insanity level of the perpetuator, to thrill you. The whole idea of using a gore scene to take majority of the movie's screen time and then satisfy the weird nature of some viewers was totally eliminated and the movie just focused mostly on character development which many may see as boring but it (the movie) still carried on to be a masterpiece. When you see the way the co-stars interact you will just bow in respect to their mastery of acting. Morgan Freeman played the old father figure and a detective who has seen too much of the streets and is so eager to retire and leave it all behind, while Brad Pitt played the younger cop, who is full of energy and is ready to jump off roof tops and chase down bad guys. The movie also made use of an array of supporting actors that are very good on their own to star in a film, actors like Gwyneth Paltrow, R. Lee Ermey, and Kevin Spacey, were also onboard in this thriller.Seven features the newly transferred David Mills (Brad Pitt) and the soon to retire William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) as homicide detectives who become deeply involved in a case about a sadistic serial killer whose accurately planned murders corresponding to the seven deadly sins gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, pride, lust, and envy.The movie's name is seven but it is mostly characterized by Se7en and it is a most see in many levels. The thrill that the movie brings and the chemistry of the co-stars is one that you will not just find lying around in any movie. Seven became the first of 3 films that director David Fincher and actor Brad Pitt did together (that is as of now 2013) the others were The Fight Club (1999) and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008).The movie was a massive hit in the 90s and it was a both a critical and a commercial success as the 30 million budget brought in over 327 million in the box office. Andrew Kevin Walker received a BAFTA Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay and the editor Richard Francis-Bruce was nominated for an Academy Award for Film Editing. Seven won the MTV movie award as the best film in its year.If you haven't seen Seven before or you are in the mood of another fun thrilling ride as we chase down Kevin Spacey, then make time to see this movie again.www.lagsreviews.com ","genre":null},{"date":"14 May 2013","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" There is no crazier movie in the 90s that can cause to feel uneasy like the way Se7en did.

Christina Applegate as Sue Ellen the young teen who finds out she is more resourceful than she realized and the marvelous Joanna Cassidy as Rose, her new boss. Keith Coogan is also a lot of fun as stoner brother Kenny who belatedly grows up. Besides the good performances the film is filled with some amusing quotes, enjoyable situations and a flashback to 90's fashion.

The film really being the perfect setup for Jim Carrey's comedy styling's. The plot follows Stanley Ipkiss, a typical working scrub. Who finds a Mask which turns him into a egotistical Cartoon character essentially. Who causes the ire of the local gangster. Jim Carrey leads the film fantastically, the zany nature of the story and his acting give the a comic book feel, giving it a timeless quality. The humour at times being very childlike, but at times having a real edge to it. The villain Dorian Tyrell played by Peter Greene is quite a ridiculous character in a lot of ways, with so many poor henchmen around him. But Greene does some how get over this and makes him pretty intimidating. The film also has Cameron Diaz possibly at her sexiest with a great entrance in to the movie, and Milo the dog contending with Carrey with some very funny moments. Things i did not quite like were the attempts at comedy involving the cops. I did like Peter Riegert cynical detective, but his inept partner was just plain annoying.A great film to take you back to your childhood and remind you how funny Jim Carrey can be.
