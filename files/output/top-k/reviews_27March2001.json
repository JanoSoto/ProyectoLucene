Enemy at the Gates is a good movie. And it is probably one of the best war-movies ever made. And it is probably one of the best European movies to hit the silver screen.

He's a private-eye and hasn't any moral problems with working to the mob. He is hired by the head of the mob, whose daughter was kidnapped, and Shaft finds himself in the line of the fire.

TV series and turns it into a multi-million dollar Hollywood blockbuster.  Like only a few of his directorial colleagues before him (De Palma is one) he succeeds.  The Fugitive is tremendously entertaining popcorn fare.   Star power is largely the key to this being such a compelling thriller.  We have a protagonist and antagonist, as usual, but Jones as the antagonist doesn't overplay the character or make the audience hate him.  Ford is impressively humble as the doc on the run.   There is one outstanding setpiece, which I won't reveal (though most readers will probably already know what I'm referring to even if they haven't seen the film)   The script is not outstanding, but neither is it awful, just serviceable.

Because it's very violent and because it's gangster genre, it is likely to be bracketed with the work of Tarantino and Guy Ritchie (`Lock, Stock' & `Snatch'). It owes little to either film-maker.`Gangster No. 1' eschews the cartoonish and U.S.-market-oriented style of Guy Ritchie; there's none of the bogus London patois Ritchie uses, the entire cast doesn't use `oh-those-quaint-Brits' pseudonyms, and there's no contrived caper serving as plot.Comparisons with Tarantino are equally moot the heart of Tarantino's work is his dialogue, which snaps with sparkle and vim. Johnny Ferguson's script, by contrast, is basic, dirty; his characters' words are brutal, to the point, saying no more than needs to be said to establish place in the pack.Spoilers ahead.The film concerns the rise of Gangster Malcolm McDowell from a henchman of gangster Freddie Mays David Thewlis to pole position in his crime pond. This rise is depicted retrospectively, recounted by McDowell, who has been prompted to reflect on his past by the news that Mays is at the end of the 30 year jail sentence, which Gangster engineered so as to clear his path to the top. The young gangster of this reflection is played by Paul Bettany.The three key actors each give sound performances. Bettany's job is to play the young ``amoral'' psychopath -- a role that has been done before, and often done by the actor portraying nothing; facial features that never move with `chilling' eyes in the middle. And Bettany does a portion of this. But we also hear an interior monologue -- his thoughts -- and those show a more complex individual. This, combined with shots where his mouth opens in a wide rictus and he emits a silent yell of mad rage, is relevant to the denouement of the film which -- to read other reviews on imdb -- has eluded some.McDowell's again emulates the set facial features of the ``psychopath.'' But his emulation is different from Bettany's -- behind the older gangster's face is man who feels he has been cheated. He has got what the younger self wanted -- power, fear, wealth -- but it has not brought him the satisfaction he was sure of. He feels conned -- like Faust, but without the agency of Mephistophilis, he has the riches and none of the happiness.Thewlis' role is that of the dangerous dandy; the slick young thug who dresses in sharp suits, who is coldly violent but mostly orchestrates rather than commits violence. He has the power Gangster wants -- and the contentment, too. We see this several times -- it is not just Mays' power Gangster wants -- it is his style -- the  way he dresses, the way he behaves. And this eludes Gangster; he sees the style he wants -- but doesn't know how to emulate it indeed being reduced at one point to wearing Mays' cast-off tie-pin -- and he sees the unstylish life of his henchmen peers -- but doesn't know how to rise out of it. Knowing where he wants to flee and where he wants to arrive, he's stuck in limbo.But the deeper source of his malcontent is Karen, a singer \/ club hostess ably played by Saffron Burrows. He is instantly captivated by her -- and instantly alienates her. Being a creature of violence he treats her though only verbally violently. He sees what he wants; and has no idea how to get it. But Freddie Mays knows how to get it -- and it's Freddie who ends up with Karen.This is the key of the film. In due course Gangster engineers Mays' downfall -- he learns that another crime boss has set an ambush for Freddie, and keeps the matter quiet. Thus Freddie gets ambushed and nearly dies. Karen apparently dies too. Gangster watches this from a hidden vantage point; and watches Karen's her death with mingled pleasure and unconcern -- partly because he can't articulate his love, partly because if he can't have her he's glad to see her dead.After the ambush he visits its orchestrator, villain Lennie Taylor Jamie Forman, and slowly tortures him to death. He takes some pleasure in this -- out of a sense of revenging Karen's death, perhaps, for the only way his love can express itself is in violence -- yet it's not wholly clear how much pleasure he takes in it. Certainly, it's a very different scene from the torture spot in `Reservoir Dogs.' It is as if there is a finer part inside Gangster, which is glimpsed in his love for Karen and in the yells of silent rage, of something-trying-to-get-out. That side is here, too -- an inner disgust at himself.Mays is jailed for this murderbigger spoilers belowGangster finds out that the released Mays is about to get married -- to Karen; Karen, who he thought was long dead.He orders Mays to come and see him. Mays is now nothing like the dandy of his youth though he's played by the same actor -- he's weary, and the cockiness has long gone. He looks back on that past with contempt; but he's still got Karen.This is a double blow for Gangster -- not only has he failed to emulate Mays, but striving for that emulation was pointless. Mays is unimpressed by Gangster. This first throws Gangster off balance and then into rage. Worse still is that Mays has bested him by ending up with Karen. And this is too much -- `Don't I deserve love?' Gangster asks. As Mays leaves, Gangster, out on the roof of his apartment, despairs; and throws himself off the edge.So beneath all the crude language which some imdb reviewers have grumbled about, perhaps thinking their villains to be polite and violence lies a well-worked out tale -- and a love story at its heart.Highly recommended.

In due course Gangster engineers Mays' downfall -- he learns that another crime boss has set an ambush for Freddie, and keeps the matter quiet. Thus Freddie gets ambushed and nearly dies. Karen apparently dies too. Gangster watches this from a hidden vantage point; and watches Karen's her death with mingled pleasure and unconcern -- partly because he can't articulate his love, partly because if he can't have her he's glad to see her dead.After the ambush he visits its orchestrator, villain Lennie Taylor Jamie Forman, and slowly tortures him to death. He takes some pleasure in this -- out of a sense of revenging Karen's death, perhaps, for the only way his love can express itself is in violence -- yet it's not wholly clear how much pleasure he takes in it. Certainly, it's a very different scene from the torture spot in `Reservoir Dogs.' It is as if there is a finer part inside Gangster, which is glimpsed in his love for Karen and in the yells of silent rage, of something-trying-to-get-out. That side is here, too -- an inner disgust at himself.Mays is jailed for this murderbigger spoilers belowGangster finds out that the released Mays is about to get married -- to Karen; Karen, who he thought was long dead.He orders Mays to come and see him. Mays is now nothing like the dandy of his youth though he's played by the same actor -- he's weary, and the cockiness has long gone. He looks back on that past with contempt; but he's still got Karen.This is a double blow for Gangster -- not only has he failed to emulate Mays, but striving for that emulation was pointless. Mays is unimpressed by Gangster. This first throws Gangster off balance and then into rage. Worse still is that Mays has bested him by ending up with Karen. And this is too much -- `Don't I deserve love?' Gangster asks. As Mays leaves, Gangster, out on the roof of his apartment, despairs; and throws himself off the edge.So beneath all the crude language which some imdb reviewers have grumbled about, perhaps thinking their villains to be polite and violence lies a well-worked out tale -- and a love story at its heart.Highly recommended.

Once again, Bruckheimer hits with this inspirational human-interest story.  This script was rejected dozens of times before it found its way to Bruckheimer's desk.  He immediately saw the potential and began shopping it around until Disney picked it up.It is a true story of a high school football team in 1971 during the first year of forced integration in the Virginia.  The team members are compelled to confront years of racial hatred and bigotry if they are to come together as a team and win.  To add to the tension, a black coach is installed as head coach, replacing a popular white coach with a history of having winning seasons.Coach Boone (Denzel Washington) runs the team like a marine boot camp.  He forces the boys to put their prejudices aside so they can coalesce into a winning football team.  He faces obstacles within the team as well as those from the parents and the school board.  Everyone is waiting for him to fail so they can pounce on him.  He never gives them the satisfaction.This is an stirring story that accurately represents the open racial hostilities of the time, especially regarding forced integration.  It gives us excellent character development of coach Boone and coach Yoast (Will Patton), as well as players Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst) and Julius Campbell (Wood Harris).  Though the plot is predictable, it is such an inspirational story that it doesn't become tedious.  There are a few oversimplifications of complex issues, like when the team overcomes a lifetime of bigotry in two weeks of football camp.  However, there are also a number of memorable and emotional scenes.The acting is terrific across the board.  Denzell Washington gives the coach a very hard edge while maintaining a certain tough charisma.  Will Patton does an outstanding job portraying coach Yoast, a man stuck in the middle of forces that are ripping his life apart.  This is the best performance I've seen by Patton, who has always been a solid supporting actor.

Appropriate because Charlotte (Wynona Ryder), like the nation, is about to shed a little of her innocence and face some difficult realities.  Cher, Ryder and an adorably young Christina Ricci are perfect as a single parent family.  Cher, in her best work ever, including Moonstruck, is a free-spirited mom who only cooks finger food because anything else is too much of a commitment.  Ryder, who narrates the film from her character's perspective, is a high school student who, despite her fervent wish to lead a devout life, falls in love with the local handyman.  Ricci is the youngest, a champion swimmer who steals the whole movie with scenes like her pumpkin scene. (Watch it and you'll know what I'm talking about.  It's unforgettable.) Bob Hoskins is hilarious as the shoe salesman who falls head over heels for Cher, family and all.Set in coastal Massachusetts, the scenery is breathtaking, and the idyllic depiction of life in a small town in the last days of American innocence is dead on.  Director Richard Benjamin, who also gave us such charming films as Milk Money and My Stepmother is an Alien, rivals Penny Marshall and Rob Reiner with this gem.This film is perfection, an absolute 10.  It's a magic potion that can make me laugh and feel good even on the worst day.  I sometimes wish I could step inside a la Pleasantville and stay there. ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"}]
