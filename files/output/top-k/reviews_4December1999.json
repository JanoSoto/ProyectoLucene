Tim Burton, master of the macabre, directed this odd movie. I have to say that this movie isn't only dark, it's hilarious. The movie is truly funny, and the blend between horror and humor was superb. It's about a wife and husband, played by Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin, who die in a car accident. The two still live on Earth, but as ghosts. Suddenly, a family moves into their house and changes it all around into a cold and weird house. The two ghosts are now miserable, so they decide to try to scare them out. It doesn't work. They go into the spirit world to ask for some help. Their advice lady gives them some excellent ways to scare them out. It still doesn't work. But something else happens, too. The family's weird daughter, played by Winona Ryder, finds out about them. She becomes they're freind. It still doesn't stop the ghosts desire to get them out of the house, so they do something no one thought of. They called a man from the spirit world, one who specializes in these sort of things. His name is Beetlegeuse, pronounced Beetlejuice, and the scares he has in his  bag of tricks are much, much scarier than the ones the two have tried already. But they start to figure out that Beetlejuice isn't doing this for them, but for himself. He loves to scare, and he'll do anything to do it. They find out that he threatens the life of the family's daughter, and themselves. They must stop him.Although it sounds sort of like a serious horror story, the movie is a total comedy. Still, it has a lot of Tim Burton style quirkiness in it. Michael Keaten is wonderful as Beetlejuice, and once again, Danny Elfman does a great score. If you like dark comedies, and you love Tim Burton, go rent this movie this second.

That's Kevin Smith. The guy's comic book fan (I love comics) and a great writer to boot.Frankly, I don't see what all those religious types got so worked up about. This film is a satire and blatantly so. I  mean, if there's anything in this world that's prime fodder for satire it's religion. Now it would have been easy for Kevin to turn this film into something that slams the Catholic Church, but he didn't. IMO, he made a movie that does point out the hypocrisies and follies of all religions, not just Catholicism, but also makes a good point about the importance of faith. It's not important what your faith is. What's important is that you have faith. I actually walked out of the theater feeling uplifted. And I'm an agnostic.While it's a good movie, this flick does have some flaws. Two of the biggest are called Jay and Silent Bob. Now I love J&SB, but I really don't think they needed to be this movie. Sure, they were funny, but I think the film overall would have been better without them.My other complaint is that so much stuff got left out. Like a lot of Kevin Smith fans I read the script for Dogma on the net way before it got to the theaters. Rufus' story about Mary and Joseph's sex life, and the Fat Albert scene didn't make the final cut. Which is a real shame since those were some of the funniest stuff in the script.Overall, this is a good movie. It does what a good satire should it makes you laugh and think at the same time.

The traditional spirit of the story was discarded in favor of a revisionist take geared toward the all action market which at times is fun but on a whole is sorely lacking and often too hip for it's own good.  The choice of Anthony Hopkins as a dashing and extremely nimble Zorro in the beginning whose appearance is anticipated by the young Zorro-to-be and his brother  as though they're anticipating the arrival of a sports hero is very far reaching and somewhat embarrassing.  The film pays more homage to Fairbanks' celebrated acrobatics skills than to the tempo which made Tyrone Power's version the Zorro for the ages in 1940. The final sword fight in that film wins out over the quicksilver and quite thrillingly choreographed battles in this version because we don't quite know all through the film if Power actually has the guile and prowess at the conclusion to run Rathbone's villain through. Such is the menace hinted at in Rathbone's mannerisms throughout and Power not being made to show his best til last  that gives that sword fight it's well deserved status as best ever on film. Here we're given five minutes to believe Hopkins transforms Banderas' illiterate swordsmanship into the deft and flawless swordfighting skills he flashes as Zorro. One is reminded of the underdeveloped spiritual transformation of Alec Baldwin from evil and destructive villain to crime fighting hero in The Shadow when Hopkins introduces Banderas to the circle, then compresses his training into a few short unconvincing scenes, dumping him in our laps as fully fledged in the kind of disciplines it takes years to master. And Banderas' Murrieto exhibits no aptitude for anything other than a bumbling and heavy footed bandido early on which makes it all the more hard to grasp.The action sequences for the most part do not disappointment, and Catherine Zeta-Jones is quite stunning in all facets of her presence.  Banderas is more than the right choice to play Zorro, and the general production values are quite high.  It is the combination of cardboard villains,  Anthony Hopkins' uneeded inclusion, and lack of a three act story that gives this film the tell-tale signs of a poorly handled concept translated into a huge missed opportunity on screen.

Michael proposes marriage to Gina but she runs off tearfully whilst at dinner in a Chinese restaurant in what is probably the best scene in the movie.\tGina, knowing her Dad and his associates, can't bear to have Michael corrupted if he becomes part of the family and so she refuses to marry him.\tBut Michael assures her that he'll be able to handle the mob and that he'll stay the honest fellow she knows. But of course the mob have something to say about that and sometimes this gets amusing.\tIn particular they insist on Michael selling atrocious art painted by a favoured mob son, forcing debtors to pay up for the paintings. It's a great way to launder dirty money.\tMickey Blue Eyes has entertaining moments. An  imbecile son of a mobster is particular fun and Joe Viterelli is his usual classic self as Vinnie.\tJames Caan as Gina's mobster Dad, battles valiantly with a rather thin script more successfully than poor James Fox (The Day Of The Jackal).But Jeanne Tripplehorn (the other Basic Instinct woman) adds very little. I found myself wishing for someone else in the part, someone who could throw in some real Sicilian  characteristics, perhaps Janeane Garofalo (The Matchmaker, The Cable Guy) for example.But as Garofalo's character Abby contended in The Truth About Cats And Dogs, actresses of her type just aren't considered glamourous enough for the likes of the suave Hugh Grant.\tWell Hugh certainly does remain debonaire in Mickey Blue Eyes; squinting, stammering and hamming his way through yet another film co-produced by associate Liz Hurley.\tThe Hugh Grant fans will find Mickey Blue Eyes entertaining enough but will we ever see Hugh Grant try another sort of character or even successfully try another way of speaking.\tSure it was funny that Michael couldn't be a wise guy, but Mickey Blue Eyes aches for the lack of spark from Hugh Grant and Jeanne Tripplehorn.

Edward Scissorhands had the emotion, Beetlejuice had the comedy, Batman had the quirkiness, Sleepy Hollow had the visual scenery, and so on, and so on. But I still think that one movie stands out when I think of Tim Burton's movie. That movie is Ed Wood. The movie is a total masterpiece! The screenplay was hysterical. The acting was superb. The music was great. The directing was amazing. Every single thing that could be cool in a Tim Burton movie is in this movie! The two actors that stand out for me in this movie is, of course, Johnny Depp, who gave an incredible performance as the worst director of all time, and Martin Landau, who was outstanding as the late horror icon Bela Lugosi.The mostly true story is about Edward D. Wood, Jr., who made such atrocities as Plan 9 From Outer Space, Bride of the Monster, and Glen or Glenda. He was awarded, after his death, an award for the worst director of all time. The movie is about his life and his journey to become a great movie director. Through his years he befriends Bela Lugosi, Crizwell, and many other '50's icons. Ed also has a problem, a problem his girlfriend (sarah jessica parker) has never known about. He's a transvestite! He likes to wear woman's clothes.The movie, although a comedy, had some dark Tim Burton moments aswell as a lot of drama in it. It fit so well together that the movie is overwhelming. I'm so glad that a large amount of critics also thought the same about this movie. Johnny Depp and Martin Landau are great, nominated Martin Landau for an award, and everyone else in the movie is great to, such as Bill Murray, Jeffrey Jones, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Patricia Arquette. Tim Burton really made a movie that could top all his other works. 2000 on a 10 point scale.

I want to be able to snow ski like that.I'd like to be allowed to wreck Q's best toys in blazes of machine gun bullets. I'd like to always look suave like Bond.The gadgets. The women. And if I was Bond I wouldn't be worried about the ethics of well, anything. No agonising over small things like cities for example.

But if M asked me to arrange the destruction of a major city, well I'd probably just do it. If it suited me.Nah, Bond's a man of action, not thought. And a hell of a lot braver than I'd ever be.James Bond is back in The World Is Not Enough and he's in form.  This Bond film is funny, engaging and exciting and right up there with the best of the Bond Films.\tThere haven't been many Bond movies in the nineties. Unlike the generations who have preceded them, younger people hardly know who he is. For the rest of us Bond is an institution.  Bond disappeared for a while. There was a six year break after Licence To Kill (1989) starring Timothy Dalton, six years for Bond to mend his wounds and indulge in some fast paced recreation in Luxemburg, lounging with gorgeous women and dry Martinis.\tBond remerged in the guise of Pierce Brosnan in Goldeneye in 1995, battling with  rogue British agent 006 (Sean Benn) and the nasty, strong thighed Xenia (Famke Janssen).\tIn Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) Bond, again Pierce Brosnan, encountered bad guy media giant Elliot Carver (Janathon Pryce) in an overloud ear smashing action movie which suffered from a lack of the famous Bond humour and subtlety. No room was left for the humour that must exist in a good Bond film.\tBut there's plenty of fun in his latest, The World Is Not Enough. And for the first time in Bond history there exists credible character development and even a story line that almost makes sense!Brosnan, who is as good as Sean Connery as 007, has as his chief adversary the nasty but sad Renard played by the superb actor Robert Carlyle (Trainspotting, The Full Monty, Go Now, Hamish Macbeth, Riff Raff, etc).Carlyle takes what could have been a very ordinary character and encourages us to actually care about Renard. A definite rarity in a Bond film.The women are played by Sophie Marceau and Denise Richards. Marceau (Braveheart) plays a part that would probably have been played by a man in previous years and takes full advantage of the opportunity.Denise Richards (Starship Troupers, Lethal Weapon 1, Wild Things, Drop Dead Gorgeous) as Christmas Jones is more like the traditional Bond bimbo, and is unforgettable as the short shorted, small T shirted, nuclear physicist!And there lies a large part of the charm of The World Is Not Enough. Sex has become fun again. Sexism? I don't think so. Bond and his women in this film have re-found the pre AIDS, pre PC world Sean Connery's James Bond inhabited in the seventies. It's great escapism.No love is lost but none of this lot want (or fear) children or HIV. Perhaps they should be worried, but when you're as bullet proof as James Bond, who cares?

This Bond film is funny, engaging and exciting and right up there with the best of the Bond Films.\tThere haven't been many Bond movies in the nineties. Unlike the generations who have preceded them, younger people hardly know who he is. For the rest of us Bond is an institution.  Bond disappeared for a while. There was a six year break after Licence To Kill (1989) starring Timothy Dalton, six years for Bond to mend his wounds and indulge in some fast paced recreation in Luxemburg, lounging with gorgeous women and dry Martinis.\tBond remerged in the guise of Pierce Brosnan in Goldeneye in 1995, battling with  rogue British agent 006 (Sean Benn) and the nasty, strong thighed Xenia (Famke Janssen).\tIn Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) Bond, again Pierce Brosnan, encountered bad guy media giant Elliot Carver (Janathon Pryce) in an overloud ear smashing action movie which suffered from a lack of the famous Bond humour and subtlety. No room was left for the humour that must exist in a good Bond film.\tBut there's plenty of fun in his latest, The World Is Not Enough. And for the first time in Bond history there exists credible character development and even a story line that almost makes sense!Brosnan, who is as good as Sean Connery as 007, has as his chief adversary the nasty but sad Renard played by the superb actor Robert Carlyle (Trainspotting, The Full Monty, Go Now, Hamish Macbeth, Riff Raff, etc).Carlyle takes what could have been a very ordinary character and encourages us to actually care about Renard. A definite rarity in a Bond film.The women are played by Sophie Marceau and Denise Richards. Marceau (Braveheart) plays a part that would probably have been played by a man in previous years and takes full advantage of the opportunity.Denise Richards (Starship Troupers, Lethal Weapon 1, Wild Things, Drop Dead Gorgeous) as Christmas Jones is more like the traditional Bond bimbo, and is unforgettable as the short shorted, small T shirted, nuclear physicist!And there lies a large part of the charm of The World Is Not Enough. Sex has become fun again. Sexism? I don't think so. Bond and his women in this film have re-found the pre AIDS, pre PC world Sean Connery's James Bond inhabited in the seventies.

Let us begin by stating what some said was a bad idea. Many thought and believe that Jar Jar Binks was annoying and just useless for the movie. Ok, well for one, he may be annoying, but so what, he is a character, he is an innovation in computer animation, and simply is funny. Many I know liked him. Jar Jar is a part of the movie and makes it work. Take him out of the movie and then most of the movie will be cut. Once you get to know him he is fine. After a few viewings you begin to understand him more.Ok, what else, Darth Maul may have been a small part but totally worth it. He was excellent and very good at his skill. Ray Park is a genius and was a great choice for the part. His character and stunts were simply amazing and wonderful to watch.Next, the movie itself was simply astounding and the FX were unbelievable. The robots and ships just looked great.As for the actors and characters, I felt they were great. Liam was good as Qui-Gonn and for those who felt he was just useless and you couldn't care about his character, well he added some effective scenes and characters. Ewan was a good choice, as was Natalie, and Jake as Anakin, who  I felt were very well suited for their parts. Ian was just wonderful as Sidious and Palpatine, who, in my opinion is the same person, but that is me. I also liked Watto and Sebulba too. All the others did a fine job too.And of course lets not forget the wonderful score by John Williams. What else can I say but to say it's JOHN WILLIAMS. I can't put words to how good he is. Just to say again, JOHN WILLIAMS is the best. No one else could do this.Anyway overall the whole movie especially the battle scene and the Darth Maul fight scene were great.Hope you enjoy the movie.
