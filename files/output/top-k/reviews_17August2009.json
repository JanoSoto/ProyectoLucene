They dig fast cars, scantily-clad women, ESPN auto-racing, and the cheapest beer available. They have no style, no culture, and the only thing better than sex is more sex. Oh yeah, and they love to see cars smashed to smithereens in every conceivable way. They're the kind of people whose highest cultural aspirations are The Man's Show, Spring Break, and Survivor. They probably think Dawson's Creek and Beverly Hills 90210 to be way too high-brow. In short, they're mooks. That's for whom this movie was produced. Not you? Better look elsewhere (and please do).So, the result is let's put all that stuff into a single movie. Make a ridiculously contrived story (if story it can be called) with lots of cars, young women, car smashes, young women, cars, more young women, more cars, and more car smashes. Oh, did I mention the cars? We'll get Sylvester Stallone to write the script and star, and the director of Die Harder to direct. It'll be a sure hit. How can it miss? All the polling says that males this age love this kind of thing. Cars and sex. We're not here to actually make movies that have a shred of originality. We're here to get kids to pay to go to the movie theatre so we can continue to live in our Beverly Hills mansions and drive our Bentleys. What happens on-screen is largely irrelevant as long as they've paid for their tickets. They can even leave if they want. In the end, we get the dough.Stallone plays the old racing has-been who has to deal with the young rookie upstart who thinks he's the next thing since Mario Andretti. Of course, long before it happened, I knew the rookie was going to be put in his place by having some terrible race, and the mentor-ship relationship was going to going to kick in where the old guy teaches the new guy. I saw that one coming before I entered the theater. This is movie-by-the-numbers. I'm sure you could pick one up at a hobby store for about $8.00.And of course there's a cliché manage a trois. Rookie dumps supermodel who then goes out with the current racing champion. Of course the champion is a complete you-know-what. Now the rookie has something to prove to get the model back, especially way from the jerk. Oh brother. Suggestion What if the rookie dumped the supermodel for the champ? At least that would have been unexpected. But of course that would have gone against everything this movie is about contrived cliché for the mooks.All I can say is this if you're a mook, this is definitely the movie for you. Buy all the cheap beer you want, order 16 Pizza Hut pizzas, and then turn on this movie after you're finished watching ESPN auto-racing. It doesn't getting any better than this. And it won't.

This is the best performance by Leigh which I have seen, and I always think she is inspired, but here she truly transcends herself. It is simply one of the greatest cinematic performances of the 1990s. Rarely has an actress so intimately portrayed the most subtle nuances of mood so well. Such an intimate film could only have been directed by a woman, and I don't believe Leigh could have done this for a male director, not even her chum, the late Robert Altman. The performance by Leigh is really as delicate as gossamer, and she spins a transparent silky web of tormented love with such intensity she outdoes even Olivia de Havilland, who played the role before her in 'The Heiress' long ago, and to do that is a miracle! The only way to describe Leigh's performance is to say that she has a 'naked face'. She seems determined to hide nothing. Pathological shyness has rarely been shown so clearly. Throughout the film, Leigh does a progressive striptease of the soul, and she ends up with nothing on but her hard-earned sense of self worth, which cloaks her admirably. Ben Chaplin is a perfect choice for the young suitor, and he mixes goodness and elegance with the desperate grasping nature of the character in an ideal cocktail that is deadly while it is sweet. And Albert Finney surpasses himself as the father so eaten up with bitterness at his wife's death in childbirth that he can never forgive his pathetic daughter for 'killing her', and actively hates and persecutes her for her entire lifetime. Henry James wrote the novel, and he knew a thing or two about people. I once knew someone who had actually met Henry James, namely Dorothy Pound, and I asked her what he was like. (Well you would, wouldn't you?) She said she never had any real conversation with him because he spent all his time talking to Ezra, and they would meet from time to time strolling in Hyde Park, when James always had an attractive young woman on his arm, he would say something pleasant to the Pounds, and then he would be off. I said but what was he LIKE? She said 'He wore a beautiful red waistcoat.' So there you go. And so does Albert Finney, as a crusty old port drinker with an American accent in this harrowing and tragic tale of intensity in the Square. By the way, the film was shot in Baltimore, and achieves a high degree of authenticity with well-preserved old houses, both inside and out. As time passes in the story, the style of 19th century costumes changes appropriately. Everything is done with finesse. The film commences with the most stunning continuous moving shot, starting in the square, then going up to the front door of the house, 21 Washington Square, then entering the house, moving through it, going up the stairs, and entering the bedroom while a newborn baby cries O.S. and the mother lies dead on her bed with her eyes open wide. Finney lies down beside her and says 'Now you will be together in heaven with our son.' What a way to open a film! And the final scene of the film, which I must not describe, is equally impressive in a completely different way, with the last shot featuring an incredible lighting effect. Technically, the film is perfect. Holland did not have Wajda as her mentor for nothing, and she is a true artist. I believe this is the finest of all the many excellent films based on Henry James stories, and most of them are so good, that is high praise indeed.

But the inherently ludicrous nature of the story isn't actually the reason why this film is so awful. The real problem here is that the impossible plot isn't the most idiotic thing about the film, and if pressed to identify the key element that makes this fourth entry in the Jaws saga such a wretched mistake, I'd have to say it's the 90 minutes between the opening and closing credits.While the unquestionably retarded logic that drives the core thesis of the plot pretty much ensures that this is going to be a mess of a film, we have to at least give Jaws The Revenge credit for being consistent, because every other absurd element in the movie reaches that same grandiose level of stupidity. In fact, when the film climaxes with our central protagonist flashing back to events she wasn't there to witness when they happened, our shark being rammed with a boat and exploding on impact, and a character who was bitten in half minutes before returning to the surface alive and well, we have to conclude that Jaws The Revenge couldn't possibly end in a fashion that more dutifully encompassed its vision.By the time we get there, we've already been forced to adapt to the idea of a shark with the ability to leap out of the ocean and balance atop the surface of the water on its tail-fins. We've hurdled through the presence of a beast massive enough to swallow a man whole, yet svelte enough to maneuver its way through the narrow corridors of a sunken ship. We've also seen an abundance of lingering close-ups that plainly show us that this revenge-seeking predator has mechanical joints and glides along the sea floor on a clearly-displayed track.But, somehow, all of this fits in the warped universe of this film, as does Ellen Brody's decision immediately after a shark attack to commandeer a boat and follow the beast out into the middle of the ocean with the apparent intention of literally feeding herself to it. When confronted with the rashness of her actions, even her response is perfectly tailored to the skewed thought process behind the film I had to, there was nothing else to do.Ellen is exactly right, too. In the world of Jaws The Revenge, staying out of the water where the shark can't get you wouldn't make any sense at all.So, at least in terms of adherence to its idiocy-laden logic, we can safely say that Jaws The Revenge is a profound achievement. And every time we think things couldn't get more absurd, our shark eats a plane or zeroes in on a Brody family member within a throng of swimmers, so JTR spends a great deal of its running time outdoing itself.It's worth noting that even the NES video game released in conjunction with this worthless offering is widely considered by those in the know to be one of the crappiest and most utterly pointless games of all time. That certainly adds another layer to the notion of consistency I mentioned earlier, but since spawning an awful video game and effectively ending a franchise are less-than-admirable legacies, I don't think there's any way around stating the obvious fact that Jaws The Revenge is one of the most dreadful films ever made.If you consider that a selling point, then spread your chum and dive on in.

The real problem here is that the impossible plot isn't the most idiotic thing about the film, and if pressed to identify the key element that makes this fourth entry in the Jaws saga such a wretched mistake, I'd have to say it's the 90 minutes between the opening and closing credits.While the unquestionably retarded logic that drives the core thesis of the plot pretty much ensures that this is going to be a mess of a film, we have to at least give Jaws The Revenge credit for being consistent, because every other absurd element in the movie reaches that same grandiose level of stupidity. In fact, when the film climaxes with our central protagonist flashing back to events she wasn't there to witness when they happened, our shark being rammed with a boat and exploding on impact, and a character who was bitten in half minutes before returning to the surface alive and well, we have to conclude that Jaws The Revenge couldn't possibly end in a fashion that more dutifully encompassed its vision.By the time we get there, we've already been forced to adapt to the idea of a shark with the ability to leap out of the ocean and balance atop the surface of the water on its tail-fins. We've hurdled through the presence of a beast massive enough to swallow a man whole, yet svelte enough to maneuver its way through the narrow corridors of a sunken ship. We've also seen an abundance of lingering close-ups that plainly show us that this revenge-seeking predator has mechanical joints and glides along the sea floor on a clearly-displayed track.But, somehow, all of this fits in the warped universe of this film, as does Ellen Brody's decision immediately after a shark attack to commandeer a boat and follow the beast out into the middle of the ocean with the apparent intention of literally feeding herself to it. When confronted with the rashness of her actions, even her response is perfectly tailored to the skewed thought process behind the film I had to, there was nothing else to do.Ellen is exactly right, too. In the world of Jaws The Revenge, staying out of the water where the shark can't get you wouldn't make any sense at all.So, at least in terms of adherence to its idiocy-laden logic, we can safely say that Jaws The Revenge is a profound achievement. And every time we think things couldn't get more absurd, our shark eats a plane or zeroes in on a Brody family member within a throng of swimmers, so JTR spends a great deal of its running time outdoing itself.It's worth noting that even the NES video game released in conjunction with this worthless offering is widely considered by those in the know to be one of the crappiest and most utterly pointless games of all time. That certainly adds another layer to the notion of consistency I mentioned earlier, but since spawning an awful video game and effectively ending a franchise are less-than-admirable legacies, I don't think there's any way around stating the obvious fact that Jaws The Revenge is one of the most dreadful films ever made.If you consider that a selling point, then spread your chum and dive on in. But, please don't consider anything I've written here a recommendation. I couldn't live with that on my conscience.

I recall wondering why anyone thought this sad story was a comedy. Obviously, it was very serious at that point. All of that said, it was well put together romantic\/movie that kind of hits a nitch between comedy and drama. The tremendous upbeat ending made all of the super-sad melodrama that takes place prior to it, well worth it. You dwelve into the life of CC Baxter, who looks to succeed in his job, and therefore, has continuously lent his apartment out to his superiors (One of whom a Mr Dobish is played by Ray Walston of My Favorite Martian and Fast Time at Ridgemont High fame). His superiors use his apartment as an inexpensive hotel to take their dates. His superiors in turn help Baxter, and he gets a job working under Mr Sheldrake (Fred Mc Murray) in Personnel. Sheldrake is aware of the shenanigans at Baxter's apartment. We find out Mr. Sheldrake is also an kind of an operator, using secretaries like a Mrs. Olsen and others for his fun. He wants to use Baxter's apartment with still another girl. Baxter who is eager to please Sheldrake, agrees. The woman Sheldrake brings to Baxter's apartment leaves something there by accident. Baxter has his eyes on an perky elevator operator, who is cold to Dobish and others who encounter her, named Fran Cubilick. He begins to make his move on her and invites her to a Christmas Party. During the party, Baxter finds out accidentally that Cubilick is the woman having the affair with his supervisor Mr Sheldrake in his apartment. Now he knows why she is so cold to everyone else. He also realizes he should not keep moving on her. He leaves. Baxter goes out to a bar and picks up another woman. Mrs Olsen, Sheldrakes, former fling, has a long talk with Fran Cubilick about Mr. Sheldrake and breaks Fran's heart, letting her know she is just the most recent woman, in a string of Sheldrake's extra-marital affairs. Cubulick says nothing to Sheldrake. When Sheldrake takes Cubilick to Baxter's apartment (she does not know it is Baxter's apartment), Fran believes she is being used and feels like a whore, especially, when Sheldrake gives her 100 dollars for a Christmas present. As a result, when Sheldrake goes home, to his wife, Fran stays in Baxter's apartment and attempts suicide by overdosing on sleeping pills.As super-sad as all of this sound, this movie's upbeat ending fell just short of making this movie a full fledged romantic comedy. If you want to stop here, this is a good place to stop and go out and get the movie and FEEL the ending for yourself.For those of you who might want to read onWhen he takes home a woman he met in a bar, Baxter finds Cubilick out cold in his bed and can not wake her. He dumps the other woman while waking a neighbor, who happens to be a doctor. They get Fran out of it after a night of coffee and walking around. Baxter takes the blame for Fran's condition himself, making his neighbor question his morality. This keeps his Supervisor, Sheldrake out of any trouble and free to enjoy Christmas with his wife and family. Over the next few days, Fran and CC Baxter talk about their lives, their problems and their mistakes. We find out, that CC Baxter also had a love affair go bad, and attempted suicide, over a woman that now sends him a fruitcake every Christmas. CC Baxter will not talk down his supervisor, Mr Sheldrake and keeps Fran thinking there is good in Sheldrake, because Baxter likes him. As a result, in-spite of all that took place, Fran continues her affair with Sheldrake. Sheldrake as a result of the suicide attempt, fires Mrs. Olsen. Mrs Olsen then talks to Sheldrake's wife and forces the Sheldrakes to divorce. Baxter talks to Sheldrake and Sheldrake indicates he has no intention of marrying Fran, despite the fact he is now divorced and Single. He wants to enjoy life as a bachelor again. Sheldrake also gives Baxter an additional promotion to become his personal assistant. Sheldrake then wants to take Fran to Baxter's Apartment for New Years. Baxter won't allow it and refuses to give Sheldrake the key. Baxter quits his job and begins packing to move. Just before mid night on New Years, Sheldrake mentions to Fran, that he needed to get a room in Atlantic City, because Baxter would not let him use the apartment. Sheldrake tells Fran that Baxter quit his job and even quotes Baxter, when he said, he especially can not take Miss Cubilick to the apartment. This clues Fran in to something Sheldrake missed, entirely. Baxter cares for Fran Cubilick and he is standing up and not being walked on for the sake of getting ahead in the job. Right at the stroke of midnight, Fran disappears and runs through the streets to Baxter's apartment, leaving Sheldrake alone.

About the structure of the movie itself, well, it's not that great, it misses the genius part making all of scenes unique and important like in PWBA, as this is not a road-trip but a small town based action, plus some characters are just not enough developed to carry the movie further on. For example, apart from the American-Dreamed-face of Kristofferson, and the simple beauty of Valeria Golino, you won't be deeply touched by their story, not interesting or innovating at all.

Nothing exciting happens as opposed to what's in the book, there's very little happening here, the acting is very wooden and the actors were woefully miscast. On a positive note, some stuff from the novel were brought into the movie. So for those who never read the novel or seen the movie, I won't give too much away. But those who expected an equally riveting novel to movie adaptation, you will be disappointed. One thing that upset me most here is the different characteristics between Adam Hall in the novel and Adam Hall (Chris O'Donnell) in the movie. In the novel, Hall is a typical attorney who's a bit green and does not know what to expect. In the movie, he's made like a big-shot who can get by in this case like a piece of cake. Okay, I understand we can't cram everything from the novel, because then it would take too long, and we're not all patient for a three hour movie; so I respect that. I think the movie had it's mind on cutting to the chase rather than unravelling the events that led to the scenes. In the end it's just better that you all should just read the book and forget about the film.

This one plays out to much like some cheesy television series episode to be as good as part three was and I never really had the urge to try and watch part five of the series. Basically, a kid gets the puppets while some strange dark lord or something sends his evil puppets out to kill, this dark lord looks like some sort of enemy from one of those live action Japanese shows like Ultraman. The movie is over before you know it though so it has to get credit for not inflicting you with a very painful to watch movie. Just to many plot holes and things in it for it to be considered an okay movie.

The observations and scientific research of the heavens of space brought upon great motivations upon writers to develop fantasy stories and fairy tales of the unknown that would inspire people in the rising genre of science fiction, in which some of the great and historic works included The War of the Worlds and The Lord of the Rings. Let's focus on the emptiness of space. Just as much as people wondered about our planet Earth and thought it to be entirely flat, we thought and we still believe that there might be life in outer space. We could imagine there to be organisms with flesh tissues or they could be microscopic cells or bacteria. Then it could be that there are human beings that are just like us in a remote galaxy.So let's explore the concept of a race of mankind that are eons away. We then ask if these humans might come to us and offer neutral peace, or are they hostile warmongering fighting factions that plan to invade our home. That is the conflicting issue of a clash of races in a hugely developed and inspiring film directed by George Lucas, entitled Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope. This is a terrific film and the strongest of the year 1977, even though it was succeeded by Woody Allen's film Annie Hall for winning the Best Motion Picture of the Year Oscar. In this Star Wars film its dramatic ideas established a very broad cultural network of other Star Wars episode films, comic novels, and even merchandise toys for fascinated children.Lucas's selected cast which I think blends very well with the story includes Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, a young Tatooine farmer and determined Jedi protégé; Alec Guinness as Luke's mentor and Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the towering huge actor David Prowse as the black caped and masked Sith apprentice Darth Vader, who is the commanding warrior of the diabolical Galactic Empire. In fact, he is given an extra scary technical feature of a mechanized voice the vocal work of the mighty James Earl Jones. A fascinating and smart looking American actress named Carrie Fisher appears as Princess Leia Organa, a white dressed rebel who defends her Rebel Alliance forces and confidentially obtains an electronic layout plan of a pale gray spherical station named the Death Star, which contains a horrifying heated green laser that could shatter and implode entire worlds. Who knows what would happen if the Death Star drifted over to Earth. Eeek! Thankfully Leia happens to have two loyal droid friends, a blue white R2-D2 and a perfectly golden metallic C-3P0, who hide the digital architectural plans in their circuits. On the other hand, I must say that I really love Leia's round sided hairdo. Carrie Fisher must have received the best hair stylists. And now the empire's Death Star weapon is headed by its leader Grand Moff Tarkin, portrayed by Peter Cushing. Tarkin and Darth Vader plan to use the Death Star to manipulate and blackmail city and territorial planets to end its recognition of an ailing Republic and obey the Empire. Should there be insubordination of the Empire by a particular world, that planet would be facing a big green laser protruded from the Death Star. The two figures of imperial power Darth Vader and Tarkin scheme to use this opportunity of power to consume whole worlds with fire that might have the presence of Rebel space bases.Even worse, Leia is kidnapped in a boarding brawl between rebel soldiers and white imperial stormtroopers in her Tantive IV ship. She's imprisoned in the plain black cells in the Death Star, and the poor Leia is toyed with by Tarkin in a bluffing matter that she would lose her home world Alderaan unless she submits the planet where the rebels are. And to show how tough these invaders are when Leia fesses up, Alderaan is ignited by the laser into a fireball! This sinister setup proves that there is no time for Luke, Han Solo, and Obi-Wan to fly around in the Millennium Falcon and watch a nova show in the space horizon, because they have to get cracking to bump back at the Galactic Empire.Going through all the visual contents of this classic fantasy adventure by George Lucas can be exhausting, which is why that I basically state that this movie is very amazing. Such beautiful and long shots include the aerial views of the tan and yellow clouded planet Tatooine, the R2-D2's curious exploring of mountainous valleys and canyon gorges of Tatooine and the numerous thrusting shots of the movement and bright laser fire between ghost-like TIE fighters and long, cool looking X-wing ships. The film shots that go in out, along, and tracking the trench forms of the other-worldly Death Star is a must see as well. As I have stated before about science fiction and literature, this monumental film takes that concept to great zooming concepts of exploring cosmic battles and dynamic locations. The exciting Star Wars film is accompanied by some of the outstanding early works of soundtrack music by the American composer John Williams. This six-time Oscar winning Star Wars is an enormously brilliant adventure of universal drama and excitement that contains lovable characters and warm, friendly relationships. I really do feel exhausted from mesmerizing about the greatness of Star Wars, which is why I give this a 10 star ranking. I appreciate IMDb's highly voted placing of this movie with other dramatic fantasy films such as The Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Dark Knight, Raiders of the Lost Ark and other fantastic storytelling movies that are admired worldwide.
