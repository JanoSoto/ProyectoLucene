The screen version of West Side Story has found itself under attack from both sides, not only from serious film fans who consider all musicals to be frivolous and unrealistic, but also snobbish appreciators of the stage original like Keith Garebian, who described it as a Hollywood vulgarisation*.It's fair enough that West Side Story is something of a sacred cow for Broadway fans. Leonard Bernstein, although not as prolific as Gerschwin, Berlin, Kern, Rodgers or Loewe, placed himself on a par with these giants of musical theatre with this one score, a mix of edgy jazz and heart-wrenching melody. The Arthur Laurents story has enough bold changes to make the Romeo and Juliet tale work for the modern era, while still retaining the forceful core and emotional impact of Shakespeare's play. Then there is the choreography of Jerome Robbins, turning aggressive tension into dance moves, with complex layers and patterns that seem almost contradictory but work harmoniously. But what is really special is how all these things weave into each other. Bernstein's score references and repeats itself; for example the oft-heard whistle, the opening line of Ma-ri-a and the start of the baseline for Cool are all the same three notes. The choreography picks up on every subtlety of the music, and blurs the lines between dancing and fighting. Even the dialogue has a kind of snappy rhythm to it, allowing the talkie scenes to flow straight into the musical numbers.Walter Mirisch, who acquired the filming rights, knew what he was doing when he handed the project to two directors, Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise. Robbins had directed it for the stage, and there was really no-one better to ensure his own choreography survived intact for the screen version. However with no experience behind a camera, it was unlikely he could have tackled the whole thing single-handed. Robert Wise was the perfect partner for him, a highly professional and dedicated screen director, who had never done a musical before but had proved himself sensitive to rhythm and movement in pictures such as This Could Be the Night and I Want to Live!. Between them, Wise and Robbins have reproduced the synchronicity of the stage show, as well as extending it in a cinematic dimension.In the location-shot Prologue, the camera becomes a part of the choreography, beginning with those jerky pans in time with the Jets' finger-clicking. This I believe was largely the input of Robbins, who was apparently fascinated by what cinema could do. He does some great work with colour, such us the red background that suddenly comes into view in that first close up of George Chakiris (Bernardo). As well as the dramatic scenes, I understand Wise was solely responsible for directing the less dance-orientated numbers such Something's Coming, Maria and Tonight. His approach is subtler, but he still cleverly merges image and music, keeping the camera close for the quieter moments, then pulling back as the song becomes bigger, allowing the backgrounds to become part of the tone. Wise also holds up the musicality elsewhere. One trick this former editor uses is to ensure that at key moments consecutive shots are jarringly different in colour and arrangement, which keeps that jagged rhythm going in image as well as sound.One major source of controversy was the changes to the cast. It was a fact in Hollywood at this time that non-singing actors would be cast in the lead roles, to be dubbed by non-acting singers. It's a shame I admit, but it's reasonable. Natalie Wood was a marvellous dramatic player and experienced movie actress, adept at emoting for the camera. Richard Beymer is not an exceptionally good lead man, but he is good enough, and at least looks the part. Still, one thing that couldn't be faked was dancing, and all the gang members are necessarily played by professionals in this respect. What is great about these supporting players is that they make dancing, singing and acting become one. Russ Tamblyn, George Chakiris and especially the magnificent Rita Moreno all dance in the way their character should move. Moreno, using her own voice for all but one number, continues to spit out her lyrics just as Anita would, treating each song as a piece of drama.But there are still one or two things for the theatre snobs to nitpick over. There is the re-ordering of several songs to take place at different times. This was done to keep the lighter songs in the first half of the picture and keep the darkening of mood towards the end consistent, and it works for the film. Bernstein apparently did not like this recording of his score, but it doesn't seem to have done the picture any harm. And there are of course those who will automatically object to a screen adaptation of anything on principle, but let's face it &#x96; we don't really need to address that here do we? All of which leaves us with just the whinges of the pretentious film fans, who seem to think that cinema is only about auteurs, film noir, nouvelle vague, the art house and bloody Stanley Kubrick. There isn't much to say to this bunch.

Filmed in 1948 in Italy, Bicycle Thieves is a neo-realistic film which deals with the poor economic conditions of Italy in the Post World War II era. The film stars Lamberto Maggiorani in the lead role of Antonio Ricci, and Enzo Staiola as Bruno Ricci, the son of Antonia Ricci. In the supporting cast, Lianella Carell plays the role Maria Ricci, the wife of Antonio Ricci.Bicycle Thief, very articulately depicts the conditions of the poor people in Italy after the World War II. Poverty, crimes, unemployment, and depression were the main issues during that period. Although, hard to relate for me with it, this cinema somewhat reminds me of the 70\u2019s era of Bollywood in which poverty, unemployment, crimes were also the main issues. Also, the frustrations of the protagonist to overcome all these issues, and to break his morals and take the wrong way in order to fight with these issues, are similar between these two cinemas.The most debatable point in the movie is the stealing of bicycle by Antonio. Is it right to commit crime of any level when you are in trouble? Is it ethical to put someone else in trouble in order to get rid of yours? These are some questions which Bicycle Thief raises. In my opinion, it\u2019s not right to commit a crime like stealing etc. to get some money. No matter how difficult your conditions are, taking the path of crime is always wrong. I maybe sound philosophical but I believe in \u201CWhat Goes Around Comes Around\u201D. If you\u2019ve done something wrong today, intentionally, you\u2019ve to bear the consequences later or as many people call it, Karma.The ending of the movie supports my point; after stealing the bicycle he\u2019s caught by the public and humiliated in front of his own son. I don\u2019t think there is any bigger insult than that for a man i.e. getting caught stealing something in front of your son.And he clearly knows it and that\u2019s why he asks his son to wait somewhere else before stealing the bike. He didn\u2019t want him to about it. He didn\u2019t want to lose his respect.\u201CBicycle Thief\u201D is a great learning experience, both in terms of film making and how to live life in general. I think the one of the strongest points of this film is its unpredictability. The director creates the situations such that you start to think that he\u2019ll get the bicycle back but you are always proved wrong. For example; when Antonio and his friends go to cycle market to find his bicycle, they meet a guy who is painting a bicycle and they think that he is a thief and it is his bicycle. And when that guy refuses to show it to them, they call the police. And just when you think they have found it, it turns out that guy is telling the truth.Also, the situation where Antonio runs after the thief gives you an idea that he\u2019ll find the bicycle but you\u2019re mistaken again. These small things create the suspense which was required in this cinema. The most surprising element of the movie is the acting and that\u2019s because Lamberto Maggiorani was not a trained actor at that time and he used to work in a factory. And, Enzo Staiola was only seven when he was cast for this role. To see such powerful performances from both the leads coming from non-movie backgrounds is mind blowing.On the whole, I absolutely loved this movie. It\u2019s a great piece of cinema and I\u2019m not surprised that it\u2019s being considered as the best neo-realistic film ever.Screen play of the movie is top notch and direction is superb. Despite being a very old film, I enjoyed it a lot. It has the perfect blend of commercial and meaningful cinema. It\u2019s the ending of the movie which really touches your heart, and makes it a masterpiece which it is today.

To see such powerful performances from both the leads coming from non-movie backgrounds is mind blowing.On the whole, I absolutely loved this movie. It\u2019s a great piece of cinema and I\u2019m not surprised that it\u2019s being considered as the best neo-realistic film ever.Screen play of the movie is top notch and direction is superb.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"28 December 2009","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Ladri di biciclette, also known as Bicycle Thief, is directed by Vittorio De Sica, and produced by Giuseppe Amato. Filmed in 1948 in Italy, Bicycle Thieves is a neo-realistic film which deals with the poor economic conditions of Italy in the Post World War II era. The film stars Lamberto Maggiorani in the lead role of Antonio Ricci, and Enzo Staiola as Bruno Ricci, the son of Antonia Ricci. In the supporting cast, Lianella Carell plays the role Maria Ricci, the wife of Antonio Ricci.Bicycle Thief, very articulately depicts the conditions of the poor people in Italy after the World War II. Poverty, crimes, unemployment, and depression were the main issues during that period. Although, hard to relate for me with it, this cinema somewhat reminds me of the 70\u2019s era of Bollywood in which poverty, unemployment, crimes were also the main issues. Also, the frustrations of the protagonist to overcome all these issues, and to break his morals and take the wrong way in order to fight with these issues, are similar between these two cinemas.The most debatable point in the movie is the stealing of bicycle by Antonio. Is it right to commit crime of any level when you are in trouble? Is it ethical to put someone else in trouble in order to get rid of yours? These are some questions which Bicycle Thief raises. In my opinion, it\u2019s not right to commit a crime like stealing etc. to get some money. No matter how difficult your conditions are, taking the path of crime is always wrong. I maybe sound philosophical but I believe in \u201CWhat Goes Around Comes Around\u201D. If you\u2019ve done something wrong today, intentionally, you\u2019ve to bear the consequences later or as many people call it, Karma.The ending of the movie supports my point; after stealing the bicycle he\u2019s caught by the public and humiliated in front of his own son. I don\u2019t think there is any bigger insult than that for a man i.e. getting caught stealing something in front of your son.And he clearly knows it and that\u2019s why he asks his son to wait somewhere else before stealing the bike. He didn\u2019t want him to about it. He didn\u2019t want to lose his respect.\u201CBicycle Thief\u201D is a great learning experience, both in terms of film making and how to live life in general. I think the one of the strongest points of this film is its unpredictability. The director creates the situations such that you start to think that he\u2019ll get the bicycle back but you are always proved wrong. For example; when Antonio and his friends go to cycle market to find his bicycle, they meet a guy who is painting a bicycle and they think that he is a thief and it is his bicycle. And when that guy refuses to show it to them, they call the police. And just when you think they have found it, it turns out that guy is telling the truth.Also, the situation where Antonio runs after the thief gives you an idea that he\u2019ll find the bicycle but you\u2019re mistaken again. These small things create the suspense which was required in this cinema. The most surprising element of the movie is the acting and that\u2019s because Lamberto Maggiorani was not a trained actor at that time and he used to work in a factory. And, Enzo Staiola was only seven when he was cast for this role.

A week later the attacker (James Russo) shows up at her home to finish the job but soon the woman turns the tables on him. That's a pretty simple set up for this psychological drama that comes off as a major disappointment. I had heard how terrific the original play was and how wonderful Fawcett was in it but this adaptation is a complete disaster that is poorly directed and features some questionable acting. I'll start with the direction which is just a complete horrid mess. There isn't a single thing in this movie that manages to have any emotion. None of the characters are believable and even worse is that we're never given anything to feel from start to finish. The opening attack sequence is meant to be full of suspense but it isn't. Fawcett's fear is meant to be dramatic but it isn't. The terror she's living in is meant to be dramatic but never is. Then when the cat and mouse game begins we're suppose to feel this psychological drama of the two characters going back and forth yet we never feel this. I've seen exploitation rape\/revenge movies that have more emotion than this thing and that's pretty sad. I wouldn't place all the blame on the director because the cast has to take some of the heat for these horrid performances. Fawcett must have lost whatever she had in the play because she gives a one-note performance here and really comes off looking bad. Not once did I believe the shock her character was going through or anything else she was suppose to be portraying. Russo is just as bad as the rapist and Alfre Woodard and Diane Scarwid come off pretty poorly as well. This is all rather shocking because all four have proved that they can give good performance so why they're so incredibly bad here doesn't make any sense. The movie never really knows what it wants to do as it throws out so many mixed messages of rape, revenge and countless other items that are thrown out there only to slowly die off or be replaced by the next thought that the film tries to explain. A poor film all around and a real disappointment.

As a movie watcher I of course really appreciate his movies and what his talent as a film-maker has done for movies in general. He has made some of the very movies within its genre and also some of the most influential ones. However still some of his movies are ones I just hate watching, even though in style and story they seem like the same ones as basically every other Hitchcock production.Well, even though I didn't fully hated watching Frenzy it also was a movie that made me cringe at times. For this movie Hitchcock returned to England and London again, after successful persuading an Hollywood career. The already aging Hitchcock made his last movies there, of which this one was the first shot movie in Britian since 1956's The Man Who Knew Too Much for him.We basically have all of the usual Hitchcock ingredients present in this movie, such as a story about a man on the run, some suspenseful sequences and some still experimental shots and build up sequences, for which Hitchcock became also so well known and praised in the movie making world. So basically this movie is the same as any other Hitchcock genre movie, then were did it go wrong? Well, perhaps the movie does feel a bit like it got made 2 decades too late, due to its overall style. As a black & white movie, set in the '40's of '50's London this movie would had perhaps worked out as a better one.But the movie seems also to be lacking with its story. It felt as if the entire script got only finished for two-thirds and it lacked a finalizing treatment. The movie really loses its focus on its main story at times, also because the main character would often just simply disappear out of the movie for a too long time.Also the casting seems like a problem. Jon Finch just wasn't the best leading man thinkable and he lacked the right charisma for his role to make his character a likable enough one you could also cheer for. Barry Foster was still good though however and he spiced things up a bit. But still basically every actor that appears within this movie didn't really seemed like the most talented ones.What still slightly raises this movie above average is because it has some original and well executed moments in it. The movie isn't really an average thriller about a serial-killer and a man that gets wrongfully accused of those murders. The movie still has more style and class to it than any other similar genre movie. Still the movie is not without its weak parts and moments.

I love thinking home every Christmas and do myself a favor after a tiring voyage from school. Marlon Brando had always never failed to portray that eccentrically misleading character, which leaves people wandering until the end of the film what side does his character envelops. I could describe the film as surreal, deep and understandably compelling, though not that compellingly entertaining compared to other genres like adventures or thrillers. Admittedly I was even puzzled how Vivien Leigh's character (Blanche Dubois) establishes. I was provisionally entranced by the way she spoke and delivers her thoughts effortlessly. One would thought of her to be mentally stable were in fact she's absolutely not. Her own issues and mental problems didn't outwitted Marlon Brando's character (Stanley Kowalski), which is also a throw back and addition to Brando's naturally captivating eccentric character. I got myself in the middle of two huge boulders upon staying tuned with the story. Which of the characters should I believe?

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"28 December 2009","score":"8 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" Go is a surprisingly engrossing, surprisingly nifty little multi-stranded crime film running on inspiration from other crime films of the era; a director's own, kinetic style and a central, focused look at a whole range of troubled, often sleazy, young adults in a modern world full of drugs; debt; dangers and the forced taking on of responsibility. When I first saw Go, I liked it a lot; revisiting it a few years later, I found it just as entertaining; just as interesting and just as engaging as I did before. Everything about the premise for Go screams that it doesn't have a cat's chance in Hell of working, but the stylised energy combined with the tasteful handling of a lot of different scenes and situations work surprisingly well, and blend to create an experience which most certainly wears you out, but in an oddly refreshing sort of way.The film, in covering an array of different characters but never bombarding nor overwhelming us, manages to deliver on a basis of both narrative and character. It is seamless in its blending of elements of the realistic with the surrealistic, all under a banner of raw energy spanning several hundred miles of which the characters travel within the picture. More recently, we've seen films which take a quick, kinetic and relatively easy-going aesthetic and apply criminal activity to it as a group of youths venture in and around contemporary America in some form. An example might be 2007 film Superbad, which did nothing but crack adolescent jokes, hate women and trivialise delicate and often illegal situations for a crowd. Go knows its place and it knows its genre as study, observations, the progression of character and some pretty frightening scenarios all play out under this same umbrella. Those that laugh at certain parts of Go have completely missed the point.The first of three stories, this and another two of which revolve around those whom aren't usually explored in films of this ilk, sees Sarah Polley's shop worker named Ronna heavily in debt; facing eviction and desperate for money. Her story sees her involved in a drug deal with two other young men and a much elder male, which grows increasingly suspicious as she interacts with them, and eventually sees her have to ditch the drugs she was meant to deal resulting in the angering of dealer Todd (Olyphant), whom gave them to her. Ronna's fearless and independent attitude towards the men in her story, in particular Todd whom is financially better off and comes with a real air of menace, presents positive characteristics for the female in this role, as she descends deeper into a situation she brought upon herself through desperation. Ronna's ability to defy her male counterparts in doing what's best for her in avoiding the drug deal sting and being able to fool the dealer as she pulls along a casual and inept male companion, in Mannie (Bexton), who'd be lost without her, adds meat and awareness to an unfortunate but otherwise familiar short story.Continuing with the film's theme of debt, and relatively hapless young adults getting themselves into hotter water than they'd like through which they'll come to learn the harsh realities of life that comes with getting involved in the sorts of activity they do, Simon (Askew), who's one of Ronna's co-workers, and a group of friends spend some time in Las Vegas. Again, the premise for the short with the accompanying aesthetic suggest it ought not work. Indeed, the trip is given the sort of leery and unnerving build when the group of four interact. In a much lesser work, it would've fallen apart at the seams, but the facing of facts that Las Vegas is a large; intimidating; confusing and dangerous place is gradually filtered through the system of the four. While not necessarily a demonisation of the place itself, it is certainly a reality check for the attitudes the characters share.The study begins with the character of Tiny (Meyer) telling a story of himself to the others which transpires to have been untrue. He is caught out, made to look a fool and the entire sequence sets the tone for the narrow-minded, adolescent beliefs the characters have and how they'll be caught out. From here, the videos telling the occupants of a hotel room how to gamble downstairs comes across as arduous and confusing, further suggesting that these guy's are out of their depth, while the causality driven mishaps ranging from food-poisoning to casual drug use that leads to hotel fires is apt. Later, theft; misogyny and raging testosterone will put them in further jeopardy with some local strip-club owners which is the climax of all this dangerous, ominous build up.The third story maintains the same consistencies the other two had in terms of study and it's to the the film's credit that the film's concept has not yet worn us out we're ready for one more. The strand centres on, like the first, usually somewhat marginalised characters for the genre; in this case two homosexual male actors, named Adam (Wolf) and Zack (Mohr), who go on a kind of odyssey which seems to be about the revealing of true feelings and unexplored sexual appetites; highlighted by the actions of a police officer and his wife when around at their house as well as the revelations that arise when they have a conversation with each other, which in turn pushes the film out into a revenge piece of sorts. Go was made at a time when Doug Liman could compliment his all-over-the-place approach to film-making with character and substance; much unlike his 2005, fetishistic firearm flick Mr. and Mrs. Smith; while his most recent work, 2008's Jumper, did not garner much of a positive critical consensus. But Go holds up, knowing what it is but additionally knowing how to explore the lives and characters within without marginalising them nor rendering them too weak, clichéd or unlikeable.

Fielding is a product tester and, through a slightly bizarre series of events goes from lovable nobody to leading figure in the rebellion occurring in San Marcos.And that's all you need to know about Bananas, which is once again a great excuse for a series of rapid, hilarious gags about everything from sex to politics to religion to . . . . cigarette adverts. It's almost as funny as his previous outing (Take The Money And Run) and if it doesn't manage to pack in a chuckle from the very beginning to the very end that's simply because there are so many in between that the beginning and very end feel a little dry in comparison.The cast includes quite an enjoyable, and varied, line-up. We get Allen himself, of course. Louise Lasser plays the love interest who leads him into the world of political activity, Nancy. Fans of Stir Crazy will recognise Miguel Ángel Suárez in a small role and we even get an early on screen appearance from a Mr Sylvester Stallone.It's unfortunate that I've almost got through this review (and overlooked the fact in my review of Take The Money And Run, too) without mentioning the writing duties shared by Mickey Rose. I have no idea who was responsible for how much of each movie but it was clearly a successful partnership with on screen results as hilarious as their final product was.If you enjoy other Woody Allen comedies then this one has plenty packed into it to assure that you'll, at the very least, pick up some more great one-liners.

Witness is neither a thriller and also nor a romance, but the love affair is totally unrealistic, it is another problem. The murder scene was poor, lack of suspense and uninspiring, even if it is the key scene of the film, or is it? Unbelievably, Peter Weir does not put emphasis on this scene. Imagine, if Hitchcock had shot it. I don't mean Rear Window, talk in general. Harrison Ford goes to the rural area. A cop does not do that, a cop does not serve a family which he tries to protect from the people who pursuit child the witness. Let's say it is a part of his job and he is a good guy. However, they say you stay in our house, you eat, drink and sleep in our house for nothing, so work! This recalls me Shane, but John Book is not a drifter. Towards morning, the father comes, pokes him and says go and milk the cows! By the way, the woman makes fun of him, when he wears the Amish costume. Oh the Amish family. I read that an audience bothered, because thinks that during the film making process, the filmmakers disturbed Amish people. People rave about this family. It seems that they adore them. Why? Why?

I did not like those characters at all, not because of their live style or ideas, I am respectful, but because of their attitudes.

The change of this character is extremely unrealistic, she was a woman who wants to get rid of him, made of him, disliked him. An Amish woman does not do that also. What happens to their conservatism? One in a million, yeah one in a million. Therefore, what is the point? Probably, it is to make housewives and women who like soap operas happy. It is an example of typical, cliché, audience-driven approach. The last part is exciting and fun, but that's all. Lastly, my expectations had been completely different. I had supposed that in a rural area, a child witnesses to a murder in the field. Then, Ford comes to there to protect him and his mother, but the murderers harass the family in order to kill the child. Yes, the story in my mind had been something like that.

I bought the new DVD and got a pleasant re-acquaintance with «Sleeping Beauty». I won't call it my favorite Disney classic of all time, but it's definitively a entertaining and enchanting Disney classic for Disney-lovers to enjoy. «Sleeping Beauty» is, layer-wise, also one of Disney's most interesting films for an adult viewer, cause the film deals with pretty dark elements. I'll actually claim that adults may enjoy the film more than the kids, cause there are some really frightening scenes. I saw «Sleeping Beauty» first time when I was eight years old and it was one of the few Disney films that actually scared me. Of course if the younger kids are going to be scared depends on how easy they are to scare, but I'll still state that parents should think twice before showing this film to the youngest family members, cause some scenes, accompanied with gloomy music, are enough to make a traumatic impact on kids (speaking of which, a earlier friend of mine got scared by the dragon and didn't wanted to see the film until he grew up).In spite of «Sleeping Beauty being really dark, it's a pretty lighthearted film, too. There are some wonderful, classical Disney moments here, which I'm going to talk more about later. But first about the characters.The best of them are without doubt the Goodfaires, which are the most present characters too. Fauna is my personal favorite. Other likable characters are Prince Philip's father, King Hubert and the horse, Samson. To claim the two lovebirds, Prince Philip and Princess Aurora, as passive characters may be unfair, but unfortunately that's the truth. But in return, they've been given wonderful singing voices by Mary Costa and Bill Shirley. And Aurora's character design is interesting, too. Malificent, on the other hand, is one of Disney's most memorable villains and there's no reason to wonder why; With her calm, collected, but cold presence she's sure to be memorized by every child and Disney villain (and I personally think she's sort of cute too). I used to think that her monster-like helpers were quite annoying, but not anymore.As mentioned, there are many wonderful and spectacular scenes; The climatic dragon-fight is one of them, but Aurora's journey towards the spinning wheel in the castle is a chilling sequence. And the sequences with her in the woods along with all the animals and her Prince is pure Disney magic, as is all the scenes with the Three Goodfaires. The animation is beautiful and the widescreen format suites this movie well, as the Tchaikowsky-music does. It was a perfect fit for the movie, by giving it more substance and sophistication, actually. Except for Hail To The Princess Aurora, the songs are quite enchanting, although they haven't been the most mentioned ones from Disney. In spite of the screenplay being quite straightforward and predictable (like you can expect from Disney at that time), there are some clever twists on the love story, which catches the interest of the viewers.So don't miss Sleeping Beauty. It's a entertaining and cute film for every Disney fans to enjoy.

While I never agreed with his character's direction,or actions,I thought he did a fabulous job. Timothy Hutton is an actor i'm not too familiar with,since I haven't seen him in much. However here he is excellent in his screen time,having a very key part near the end. Leslie Stefanson is very pretty and did well,with what she had to do.Bottom Line. The General's Daughter is a superbly crafted,murder mystery. It will often leave you on the edge of your seat,while entertaining you in the process. It was a great way to spend two hours,therefore,I highly recommend it.8\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"28 December 2009","score":"6 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" The General's Daughter pulls out all the stops to give you an unpredictable ride,you won't soon forget!. It starts off at a horribly slow pace,from then on,I honestly thought I was in for a long night,but it quickly picked up,and put me in it's grip,while never letting go. It throws some great little swerves your way,to keep you guessing who the major culprit is. And while I had a decent feeling what the main conspiracy was gonna be,and I ended up being right,it still gave it a very nice try. I really liked the atmosphere it had to it. Seeing Brenner walk around the base often managed,to give me the chills. Some have complained about John Travolta's miscasting as Brenner. However I have to disagree,he had the perfect balance,of cockiness and charisma to Brenner. Here, he played an arrogant,but likable hero. Rape is quite the controversial subject,so I found the featured subject to be,quite uncomfortable. The ending itself is a knockout. The confrontation between Brenner and Lt.Gen Joseph Campbell is one to remember,and very suspenseful. The General's Daughter is quite a delight of a film. I was quite surprised,by how engaging it truly was,the 6.1 rating is horribly low,for the quality of this film.Performances. John Travolta is a rock as Brenner. He oozes charisma,while bringing that patented charm,we know all too well about. He's full of himself,but we appreciate his tenacity,his never back down attitude,and most importantly,his chemistry with Madeline Stowe,is above average. James Woods is a revelation as Moore.

When I began watching this on SBS TV in Australia at midnight I had not checked the guide for the actual title of the movie - quickly did this on IMDb while the titles rolled (very impressive they were too) and realised that as a del Toro film I had better watch it as the ratings sounded good. Everyone else has told you the story - but as there are no recent reviews they do not mention Pan's Labyrinth, which is del Toro's most recent film shown in Australia any way (I don't count the Hellboys in this as they are not in Spanish and I have not seen them). OK ghost story is a convenient tag but it sounds a bit cheap for this sort of quality film - and so far removed from the hack American films of that type which the genre suggests. Having already seen Pan, which is also set in the Civil War and has some vicious moments which reflect the period, but is overall more of a fantasy (those tags again) it was interesting to see this. They are more than similar in mood and atmosphere - with Pan I went along with the atmosphere and feel more than the story. The photography here is also great and the music\/sound is wonderfully atmospheric and makes you really jump at a couple of points (someone already mentioned the hiding in the cupboard scene). The way it is set from the children's' point of view is interesting - although not really a film for children! All in all a very good effort - not perhaps entirely a masterpiece for me as for some other 10's - but I liked it a lot and can recommend it to followers of del Toro's work (now that I have seen two!).
