Memento was, in my opinion, the best film I saw last year, and I am still upset that I missed it in theaters.  So last night, off I went.Twelve hours later, I still haven't slept.  I thought this film was spectacular.  From the opening credits (after nearly twenty minutes of previews and commercials) to the closing shot, this film was brilliantly conceived and executed.  I thought, for starters, that it was amazingly tight.  At pretty much exactly two hours, Nolan knew what we could and could not handle.  The editing was the other element that just blew me away.  The intercut shots were often terrifying and mood altering.  Just when I would start to relax (due in large part to the hibernation-inducing temperature of the movie theater and not the film), I would be jolted by an image that reminded me how important, fragile and scary this film is.The acting was also fabulous!!!!  I do not think I have ever enjoyed Pacino so much (except for in The Godfather and Godfather II), but Robin Williams was the one who really left my mouth open.  One review I read accused (or praised) him of being the first actor since the release of Silence of the Lambs who was not imitating Anthony Hopkins, including Anthony Hopkins.  I could not agree more.  He is effective because of the nuances a look, a gesture, a nervous laugh.  If he always played villains, he could not be this effectives.  The reversal is what shook me and kept me up all night.  Ms. Swank's youthful idealism also worked for me, and I think it would have been more universally acclaimed if she had been given more time to develop her character.I think the most important note about the acting is that none of these characters is sympathetic.  These aren't villains and heroes, good guys or bad guys, no matter how much we want them to be.  Just like the grey fog that blankets everything in the film, these are grey people caught in a situation in which they have ... but what is it that they have?  Agency? Responsibility?  Choice?  Your answer to this question colors (pun intended) your response to the film.  Much discussion, literal and figurative, takes place about truth vs. Truth and black\/white vs. grey.  In many ways, this was the heart of the film just as it was in Memento.  The coolest part about Memento I thought was the way Nolan manipulated our tendency to gravitate towards certain characters because of cinematic conventions and assumptions.  I thought the same was definitely true about Insomnia, except this time we were left in limbo rather than realizing we had been wrong the entire time.  The scariest part of Insomnia is realizing you can't compensate, you can't correct for this.  No matter what and who you choose, you are wrong in some way.I also enjoyed seeing the emerging motifs Nolan uses scenes with characters looking in mirrors, unlikely locations for chase scenes, dark vs. light cinematography, blending the typical and the extreme, and an intuitive sense of time.  I would say that these are used in a less abstract, more accessible way, but the other user comments I read lead me to believe that perhaps the status Memento already had when people saw it influenced their opinions and reactions.  So perhaps the best advice I can give is see this film with an open mind.  But isn't that always true?It is important, however, to realize that this film has more in common with Double Indemnity, Touch of Evil and Alfred Hitchcock than with the typical thriller of today.  The body count is considerably lower, and if you enter the theater demanding extreme violence, definitive answers and a sense of closure because of the genre of the film, you will not be satisfied.  Perhaps Nolan's message has to do with the idea that he is going make the film he wants to make, tell the story he wants to tell and undermine our position\/power in any way he can.

Yes, the cinematography is beautiful, and Spacey gives a great if not somewhat overrated performance.

","genre":"Fantasy, Mystery, Romance"},{"date":"2 June 2002","score":"","review":"  Allow me to warn you that this review contains spoilers and is lengthy.I was introduced to Tom Clancy and his character Jack Ryan in the 1990 film THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER (THFRO).  Subsequently I read many of his Ryan novels and have seen all the movies.  I feel that THFRO is his best novel and his best movie.  That movie is the only one of the Ryan movies that stays fairly close to the original novel.  The problems with PATRIOT GAMES(PG) and CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER (C&PD) movies is that while the overall premise for each movie stays relatively the same there are some characters that drastically changed.  For instance in C&PD FBI agent Dan Murray is killed off during a trip to Columbia.  In the novels his character lives on & has a role in THE SUM OF ALL FEARS (TSOAF).  I hate when this happens because now if a film is to be made of a novel that has Dan Murray in it the film writers are going to have to rewrite part of the story and that usually means they are going to screw the story up.  Well, last year before 9-11 I became aware that a movie was going to be made of TSOAF and was greatly excited.  Next to THFRO this is my favorite Clancy novel. After 9-11 I waited for months to see if they might cancel this film because parts of the novel came so close to events in 9-11.  I was glad to hear that the film was still going to be made, that was until I saw it.  Now I wish they had scrubbed the whole project.  Listed below are comparisons between the novel and film for TSOAF.First let me deal with Afflec as the new Jack Ryan.  I thought Alec Baldwin was an excellent choice for Ryan in THFRO.  I was less pleased with Harrison Ford in PG but thought he did very well in C&PD.  I suspected that Ford would not be back in the role of Ryan after I saw AIR FORCE ONE (AO).  For anyone who has read Clancy's novels DEBT OF HONOR & EXECUTIVE ORDERS knows that Jack Ryan becomes National Security Advisor, then Vice President and finally President.  I felt that after having played the President in AO that having Harrison assume that role in a future Clancy novel would cause viewers to confuse and compare the two roles.  I was hopeful that Baldwin would resume the role of Ryan, lord knows he could use a good role.  When I learned Affleck was getting the role I became scared for the whole film. Despite what a previous reviewer stated Ryan's role in TSOAF comes after the events in THFRO, PG and C&PD.  By the time TSOAF comes along Ryan is the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence aka DDCI.  Ryan is now giving the President and his staff intelligence briefs and is a fairly important position.  Also, it is his experience that allows him to do what he has to do in the book to save the day.  By picking an actor who is not even 30 to take over the role and to have Ryan just starting in the CIA causes a major continuity problem.  I don't see how you can ever make DEBT OF HONOR or EXECUTIVE ORDERS into films.  Ryan's to young legally to become Vice President or President.  I believe you have to be at least 35 years old.Next, the plot sustained major changes.  The bomb goes off in Baltimore instead of Denver.  This is important because in the novel the President is not at the game but instead is at Camp David.  Cabinet members are at the game and killed which leaves the President cut off from his advisors and allows his own fear and misunderstanding to allow the situation to escalate. I won't even go into the Nazi terrorist in the movie versus the Arab funded terrorists in the book.  I suspect this was changed for pc reasons, especially after 9-11.  Having Nazi's responsible for the terrorism sounds less like a Clancy novel and more like a Cussler novel.  Also, Ryan was never at the scene of the explosion but in the DC and Maryland area.  After the explosion went off the real tension in the novel's story comes from the difficulty Ryan is having convincing the President the Russians did not cause the explosion.  This is difficult because the President is receiving bad advise from his National Security Advisor, a female with whom he is sleeping.  Also the President is not married, his wife died while he was in office during his first term as President.  It is these circumstances that lead to the Presidents paranoia.  To overcome this Ryan consults with the Vice President and it is this which eventually leads the Vice President who later becomes President to make Ryan his National Security Advisor and later Vice President.  The movie just never has the background to support the Presidents irrational behavior and the tension level achieved in the book is not achieved in the movie.There are many other character changes in the movie.  One such change is that of the Russian general who works for the CIA as agent Spinnaker.  In the novel Spinnaker is a double agent who has given the CIA good intel for years but in TSOAF lies to the CIA in order to position himself as the next leader of Russia and to advance his own political ideas.  It is these lies that help promote the fear that it was Russia that attacked the U.S..  In the movie Spinnaker remains a good source of intel for the CIA and really undercuts the suspense and tension level.  Then having the double agent come to America and congratulate Ryan on his wedding was insulting to the story line in both the book and the film.  Another bad change is that of James Greer (played by James Earl Jones) in the other 3 Clancy movies and novels. Greer is the one responsible for bringing Ryan into the CIA and guiding his career.  Everyone who has read or scene C&PD knows that Greer dies.  What I can't figure out is why, if this story is now at the beginning of Ryan's career in the CIA, couldn't they have bought back Greer to guide him instead of Cabot.  Cabot didn't come along until much later.  I suspect the producers of the film didn't want to bring back Greer because fans of the story wouldn't accept seeing him back in the films since they believed he was already dead.  However the producers don't seem to think these same fans will mind seeing Ryan's character set back 20 years.  Go figure???Lastly,  I know Hollywood has to change novels storylines when they adapt them for film.  However this can be done with out bastardizing the plot and story line.  When I think of THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and how close it stayed to the original storyline I appreciate all the more what Peter Jackson and that films producers did.  Seeing this abomination makes me cringe at what a perverse tragedy can be done to a storyline by those committed to making money verses their commitment to a good story.  The sad thing here is that Clancy novels have their own built in fan base and when Hollywood produces a piece of crap like this it's really insulting and robbing the fanbase that brought the film about.

I had a certain curiosity about it, being that it was directed by Emilio Estevez and starring him and his real-life Dad, Martin Sheen.  I love to see a movie about a father-son relationship that involves a real-life father and son.  Naturally, there's an instant chemistry between Sheen and Estevez, and their scenes of conflict are even more intense, knowing that they're actually related.  Of course, it helps that the two of them are both terrific actors.  I've seen Martin Sheen in intense roles before, but I think this is Emilio's most intense role--being that I mostly recall him from the Mighty Ducks series--and I was very impressed.  Talent REALLY does run in that family.  And Kathy Bates steals the movie in an Oscar-worthy performance.  She tugged at my heartstrings with every word of dialogue.  Kimberly Williams--the beautiful actress from the Father of the Bride movies--is also very good, holding her own among a group of talented veteran actors.  The movie is a bit stagey, with dialogue that's obviously geared for the stage, but that didn't bother me.  This is not meant to be an action movie; this is a character study.  And for a film that's based on a play, it never gets too claustrophobic.  When Emilio's character, Jeremy, reminisces to his days in Vietnam, we actually see his harrowing memories brought to life. The film is extremely powerful and realistic, without being sentimental.  At the end, I expected all the conflicts to be resolved and the family would become hunky-dory, but that's not how it turned out.  The ending made me cry, without resorting to standard Hollywood melodrama.  That proves reality is much more gripping than anything Hollywood can conjure up. If you're in the mood for a beautiful, powerful drama with extremely wonderful performances that will knock your socks off...please check out this underrated gem.  Hopefully, one day Martin and Emilio will unite with Charlie, and they will all make a great film together.

Still to this day it remains one of the most terrifying movies of all time and is also incredibly popular. But when it was released, I'm sure a lot of people were a little curious what would happen to Chris and Regan after the exorcism and what really did happen to Father Merrin in that bedroom. However some questions are better left unanswered because we got a lot of the answers in Exorcist 2 The Herotic, one of the weirdest movies ever released. Also when I say answers, I mean the garbled up, taken by aliens, experimented on, thrown back up by the aliens onto Earth mixed in with some acid and put onto the silver screen where it was booed out of theaters. It was immediately removed and edited like crazy and still there was no way the audience was going to ever give this film a chance.Lamont is assigned by the Cardinal to investigate the death of Father Merrin, who had been killed four years prior in the course of exorcising the demon Pazuzu from Regan MacNeil. Regan, although now seemingly normal and staying with guardian Sharon Spencer in New York, continues to be monitored at a psychiatric institute by Dr. Gene Tuskin. Regan claims she remembers nothing about her plight in Washington, D.C., but Tuskin believes her memories are only buried or repressed. Father Lamont visits the institute but his attempts to question Regan about the circumstances of Father Merrin's death are rebuffed by Dr. Tuskin. In an attempt to plumb her memories of the exorcism, specifically the circumstances in which Merrin died, Dr. Tuskin hypnotizes the girl, to whom she is linked by a synchronizer, a biofeedback device used by two people to synchronize their brainwaves. We see what really happened to Merrin and the times that he did face the demon prior to Regan.Exorcist 2 certainly is a bad movie, however, I must give some credit as it's a really interesting story. It's just made with the wrong people and was directed by a man who hated the first film. I think that's why it's a bad movie in some sense, it seemed to disrespect the original. Also them repeating the demon's name Pazuzu was just annoying and makes the demon sound less frightening. One of the things I loved about the original is that the demon that possessed Regan was kept a secret and left up to interpretation, she says she's the devil but Kerris brings up the point where that's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. Then Merrin brought up that the demon is a liar, so we could deny that she's the devil himself. But giving the name Pazuzu just didn't work, well at least when you say it more than a dozen times. James Earl Jones and the locust costume was just way too funny and the funny thing is this movie was released the same year as Star Wars, wouldn't it be hilarious if he got off the set and went to do the voice work as Darth Vader in that costume?! Exorcist 2 is not the worst movie of all time, it had tremendous potential with the story, but due to the people that were working on it, it just was doomed to not hold a candle to the original. I would say that this movie is a skip, if you want to see this movie I recommend just taking acid and watching the first film.3\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"2 June 2002","score":"34 out of 46 people found the following review useful","review":" I don't think anyone knew what hit them when The Exorcist was released in the theaters in 1973.

In an attempt to plumb her memories of the exorcism, specifically the circumstances in which Merrin died, Dr. Tuskin hypnotizes the girl, to whom she is linked by a synchronizer, a biofeedback device used by two people to synchronize their brainwaves. We see what really happened to Merrin and the times that he did face the demon prior to Regan.Exorcist 2 certainly is a bad movie, however, I must give some credit as it's a really interesting story. It's just made with the wrong people and was directed by a man who hated the first film. I think that's why it's a bad movie in some sense, it seemed to disrespect the original. Also them repeating the demon's name Pazuzu was just annoying and makes the demon sound less frightening. One of the things I loved about the original is that the demon that possessed Regan was kept a secret and left up to interpretation, she says she's the devil but Kerris brings up the point where that's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. Then Merrin brought up that the demon is a liar, so we could deny that she's the devil himself. But giving the name Pazuzu just didn't work, well at least when you say it more than a dozen times. James Earl Jones and the locust costume was just way too funny and the funny thing is this movie was released the same year as Star Wars, wouldn't it be hilarious if he got off the set and went to do the voice work as Darth Vader in that costume?! Exorcist 2 is not the worst movie of all time, it had tremendous potential with the story, but due to the people that were working on it, it just was doomed to not hold a candle to the original. I would say that this movie is a skip, if you want to see this movie I recommend just taking acid and watching the first film.3\/10 ","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"2 June 2002","score":"34 out of 46 people found the following review useful","review":" I don't think anyone knew what hit them when The Exorcist was released in the theaters in 1973. Still to this day it remains one of the most terrifying movies of all time and is also incredibly popular. But when it was released, I'm sure a lot of people were a little curious what would happen to Chris and Regan after the exorcism and what really did happen to Father Merrin in that bedroom. However some questions are better left unanswered because we got a lot of the answers in Exorcist 2 The Herotic, one of the weirdest movies ever released. Also when I say answers, I mean the garbled up, taken by aliens, experimented on, thrown back up by the aliens onto Earth mixed in with some acid and put onto the silver screen where it was booed out of theaters. It was immediately removed and edited like crazy and still there was no way the audience was going to ever give this film a chance.Lamont is assigned by the Cardinal to investigate the death of Father Merrin, who had been killed four years prior in the course of exorcising the demon Pazuzu from Regan MacNeil. Regan, although now seemingly normal and staying with guardian Sharon Spencer in New York, continues to be monitored at a psychiatric institute by Dr. Gene Tuskin. Regan claims she remembers nothing about her plight in Washington, D.C., but Tuskin believes her memories are only buried or repressed. Father Lamont visits the institute but his attempts to question Regan about the circumstances of Father Merrin's death are rebuffed by Dr. Tuskin.

Why didn't they just organize a private screening with a group of whiny feminists, so they can look up at the screen and cheer?  Now, I wasn't offended by the film's depiction of men.  It was just laughable.  In Thelma and Louise some of the male characters were portrayed negatively, but in a believable fashion.  And that film was actually written by a feminist!  In this case, we have a one-dimensional abusive husband who slaps his wife and spouts out such cliched dialogue as, I make the money in this house!  We go by my rules!  His wife catches him cheating one night, and suddenly he loses his conscience?  Come on, she did marry the guy!  He can't be that cold-blooded.  That proves that this is no more than a propaganda film that preaches its message like a minister at his morning sermon.  Yes, millions of women in this world get abused.  But usually, there's some sort of motive behind it--whether or not it makes sense.  And if not, it's due to alcoholism or drugs.  The husband's anger in this story is merely a setup for a final kickboxing match between him and J-Lo.  So if you've seen the trailers, you've seen it all.  No surprises here.  And can someone please explain why her ex-boyfriend is the nicest guy you can possibly meet?  This gent travels to the ends of the earth for her, providing shelter for her and her daughter, covering up for her when the FBI comes to search the place.  Yet she dumped HIM?  That's one mystery I have yet to find out  Why is that in movies the ex-lovers are always so much more likable than their current lovers?    Jennifer Lopez is a fine actress, but she doesn't have much to work with here.  Her job is to cry and scream like a hammy soap opera actress, until she finally transforms into Rambo in the third act.  There are no thrills or chills.  All the suspense is pure cliche.  We have the ringing telephone and even one scene in which J-Lo's daughter is playing with a basketball, it rolls away and the ball is stopped by...take a guess!  The dialogue becomes more and more horrible by the nanosecond.  Juliette Lewis seems totally misplaced in a thankless role written for a fourth-rate actress.   Domestic abuse is a serious subject, but in this film it's totally trivialized to conventional thriller.  If you want to see a more believable film about domestic violence, watch the John Travolta film Domestic Disturbance.  This would've made a good PSA, but why waste time and resources making this into a big-budget Hollywood movie?  I can't say this is simply a J-Lo vehicle, especially since she's far from glamourized in this role, sporting a short hair-do and having her face bruised through half of the movie.  Her past films, like The Wedding Planner and Angel Eyes, were J-Lo vehicles, but I liked those two movies.  It's films like this that will help end her career.  The only thing a movie like this is worth is a barrell of unintentional laughs.  If you treat this as a comedy, you might be somewhat entertained.  'Cause every aspect of this film is funny  the dialogue, the countless cliches, the cardboard characters.  Hell, I probably got more laughs out of Enough than Corky Romano.  Women will probably cheer when J-Lo gives her husband the 1-2 punch.  But if you're not a woman, or the average woman, you will find this pseudo-thriller completely laughable.
