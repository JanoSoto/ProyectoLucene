He does it so well once wishes he had played more villainous types in his career instead of caricatures of himself (as time went on). The Searchers and Rio Bravo (made a year or so later) are his two best films of the 50s. Arguably his 2 best films ever. But The Searchers has few flaws that detract from its greatness. One is the fistfight between Marty and his romantic rival; it's typical John Ford stupidity. All of his films seem to have a comic fistfight as apparently Mr. Ford thought a few numbskulls with an excess of testosterone braining each other was funny. Here it really destroys the mood of the film. (Actually, it's pretty dumb in all his movies.) In fact, the whole romantic subplot with Marty is unnecessary. It's Hollywood not the West. Another flaw is the appearance of Natalie Wood towards the end. This is a girl who has been living with the Indians for 5 years. Apparently there is an Avon lady in the tepee next door to hers, as she is sporting more eye makeup than any other female character in the movie. Whoever decided to make her up that way apparently did not care that it destroys the credibility of the character. Or is that why John Wayne didn't kill her -- because she is so cute and white people-looking? Indeed, why did he change his mind? That is never truly explained. Nor is it explained why her sister was killed and she wasn't. Not really. And why did all the women who were rescued from the Indians go insane? Is it true that all women of the old west were functional idiots and the least little thing would send them over the edge? Not one woman had the stamina to survive the ordeal with her mental faculties intact? This seems highly unlikely. But to return to the movie itself -- it has seeds of greatness; it's just too bad some stupid decisions were made in the filming.

Valerie visits Danyael again & they fall for each other, before you know it they are in bed together & have sex which Valerie quickly learns has left her pregnant. If that wasn't bad enough an evil archangel Gabriel (Christophere Walken) is out to kill her since Danyael was in fact an angel & their child will unite heaven as told in a prophecy which the evil Daniel doesn't want because he wants to rule heaven himself & destroy Earth in the process. Valerie must stay alive long enough to raise her child or both heaven & Earth will be destroyed, now that's pressure...Co-written & directed by Greg Spence I thought The Prophecy II was a decent time waster but nothing particularly special. The script by Spence & associate producer Matt Greenberg is fairly exposition heavy & has some interesting ideas but it's a bit slow even at less than 90 minutes & is sometimes a little hard to follow. I admit that I have never seen the original The Prophecy (1995) & as such I didn't have a clue what was going on for the first half of this film, this is a sequel where it is advisable that you have seen the original because if your anything like me you'll spend the first half wondering who everyone is what the hell's going on, I mean there's an early scene where some guy in a long coat touches the ground of some parking lot & then cracks in the ground open & Christopher Walken's character emerges & I sat there & thought to myself 'what just happened there & who was that guy?' neither of which are satisfactorily explained. There are various religious ideas & themes with horror & supernatural overtones & elements here as one would expect in a film about angels & while they are OK they never really engage or interest that much & are fairly forgettable. I liked the notion that an angel didn't know how to drive or what a computer is with Christopher Walken not even knowing how to use a gun. If you like religious themed horror them you'll almost certainly like The Prophecy II but if you don't then, like me, it may not do too much for you.Director Spence does a good job & the film has a great sense of style, there's some nice colour schemes going on as well. There are a few eerie moments but I wouldn't say it's particularly scary, it does have a nice atmosphere though. There's not much gore on show, there are a couple of ripped out hearts, a few impalings & a messed up body on an autopsy table. Some of it's a bit silly, I mean I don't know how Valerie survives falling off the top of that building, Gabriel's body wouldn't have been enough to break the fall & even if it was why wasn't she impaled on the spike along with him? By the way if your interested the IMDb has spelt Danyael's name wrong in their 'Plot Outline' on the main page...Going straight-to-video this probably had a decent budget & it show's, it's well made & pretty stylish with it.

The place it is set in is Anywhere, USA, or actually Lumberton, however the place could quite easily be anywhere, an ideal haven, where everything is so perfect, it almost qualifies as being surreal. With Bobby Vinton and Roy Oribison on the soundtrack, Mr. Lynch presents us blue skies, trim flowerbeds, and sweet little houses of suburbia that is obviously hiding under a deceiving surface. And minuets after the opening, after a man watering his garden collapses from an apparent seizure, the camera swoops down under neat, weed less lawn to observe the teeming hordes of insects living in the dirt. And know we know that something is lurking, waiting to be exposed.Figuratively speaking, the film needs to remain at a bug's eye level for nearly two hours until it is ready to return to the surface for an ironically sunny coda. And if the sheer creepiness of that first descent seems a hard act to follow, Mr. Lynch is more than up to the challenge. As he superbly proved in his earlier, experimental nightmare Eraserhead (1977), set in the ruins of a decaying apocalyptic world.

Here, he watches, through a cupboard, a woman being sadistically tortured by the inimitable Dennis Hopper's Frank Booth. And that is where it starts; another scene to follow features an unstable Frank watching his accomplice in crime, Ben lip synch to Roy Orbison's haunting In Dreams.

If you look close enough you'll find all of them in the film, as well as some in the film within this one. The Player is a scathing, smart, and funny attack on the Hollywood studio system and doubtless one that will be enjoyed more by those who have prior knowledge of the studio system, or are simply just movie fans. This film is packed with cameos, specific references to film history and only a truly dedicated movie fan could catch all of them.The film opens with an eight minute long continuous shot which follows the lives and discussions of several executives and other personnel at a movie studio. This shot establishes several important characters as well as the cynical tone of the film (we hear a pitch for The Graduate 2 set 25 years after the original among other ridiculous discussions). It also pays tribute to Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock, even mentioning Welles' Touch of Evil and its similar opening shot as well as Hitchcock's Rope. Soon we meet Griffin Mill, a studio executive whose job is basically to hear pitches and either approve them or turn them down. His job isn't to pick the good movies, it's to pick the moneymakers (later in the film a character talks about The Bicycle Thief, a product of Italian Neo-Realism and says that's an art film, it doesn't qualify. We're talking about movie movies). One of the writers Mill turned down starts to send him threatening postcards and he assumes this person is David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio), so he tracks him down and semi-accidentally kills him, leading to a rather typical police investigation into the matter. Mill begins a romance with Kahane's widow, further adding to the convoluted Hollywood thriller plot.In a wonderfully funny subplot Mill approves a pitch for a bleak, dark drama in which an innocent woman is sent to the gas chamber. The pitch is for the film not to include a happy ending and also 'no stars, only talent'. The subplot is developed alongside the main plot and used mainly for pure comic relief (nothing in The Player is serious drama, but the main plot is played straight and is mainly satiric in its ridiculousness, mostly avoiding big laughs in favor of more subtle humor). Over the course of the film the criteria for a good Hollywood film are all met. There's suspense (suspense in the Hollywood sense), laughter, violence, hope and heart (we manage to feel supportive of Griffin Mill even though he's mostly heartless and cruel), some nudity thrown in for good measure, and even an utterly idiotic sex scene which of course has nothing whatsoever to do with the plot. The brilliant double-ending is played for laughs and remains one of the best I've ever seen.The screenplay by Michael Tolkin (who also wrote the book) is pitch-perfect in its balance, it manages to be satiric without descending to farce and scathing while remaining good-natured. The acting is excellent all around, particularly from Tim Robbins, who is perfectly capable of a strong performance (see Clint Eastwood's Mystic River), but plays his role here like any bland lead in a Hollywood thriller. He doesn't even bother emoting for the majority of the film, which only makes the satire stronger.With The Player Robert Altman returns to form and makes a worthy addition to his impressive filmography (which includes films like Nashville, Gosford Park and MASH). The film is funny both in a traditional manner and also in a dark, satirical manner. By including all of the elements of typical Hollywood in his film Altman has crafted a crowd-pleaser as well as a tribute to film and film fans everywhere.

I guess whoever was in charge figured all the kids would be asleep by the time they put this on, but I managed to stay awake and watch the lot, and Critters became a firm favourite of mine for the next few years. Despite seeing this film and the first two sequels several times as a kid, I could pretty much remember nothing about it when it came to watching it this time; and despite the fact that Critters is not quite the film I remember it being, this is still a fun little eighties crapfest with plenty to recommend it for! The plot focuses on a war in outer space that spills over onto a farm in a small mid-western town. The town unwittingly greet a meteorite, that later gives way to a host of nasty, furry little creatures with big teeth! Hot on their tails are a pair of intergalactic bounty hunters sent to track down the furballs - but the 'critters' get their first, and manage to cause quite a lot of damage before the bounty hunters eventually arrive...Critters is clearly reminiscent of the 1984 hit Gremlins, as evidenced by the basics of the plot as well as the focus on humour. The critters themselves are hilarious little creations - thick black hair and a mouth full of teeth, but in their own way they're also fairly frightening! Gremlins isn't the only influence on this film - the whole idea of something bad coming from space being followed by something to stop it obviously came from The Terminator, and there are a number of other ideas taken from elsewhere - but the film doesn't feel like a bunch of stolen ideas, and that is to it's credit. The secluded farmyard setting is also to its credit, and again, while it's not the most original location for a film like this to take place, it works well so that isn't a problem. The cast, which includes the likes of M. Emmet Walsh, Dee Wallace and Billy Zane, all do their jobs well, and the action is always exciting enough to ensure that the film remains interesting.

Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise combine flawlessly to give two of the finest performances of the 1980s, and director Barry Levinson &#150; following the success of 'Good Morning, Vietnam' &#150; took home his only Oscar to date. 'Rain Man' was monumentally successful at the 1989 Academy Awards, nominated in eight categories and taking home statues for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Hoffman), Best Director, Best Picture and Best Writing, Original Screenplay. Unbelievably, Tom Cruise &#150; despite giving one of his career-best efforts &#150; did not receive an acting nomination.Cruise plays Charlie Babbitt, a selfish young Los Angeles car dealer who is in a spot of financial trouble. After learning of the death of his estranged father, Charlie attends his funeral in Cincinnati, and is shocked to discover that his father's $3 million inheritance has been left to somebody else. Thus, Charlie comes to learn of Raymond Babbitt (Hoffman), his autistic savant older brother, of whom he had known nothing. Whilst Charlie has a photographic memory and is a prodigy with numbers, his autism means that he cannot look after himself, and, furthermore, he has no understanding of the concept of money. Eager to rob Raymond of his inheritance for his own selfish reasons, Charlie basically kidnaps him, despite the objections of his girlfriend, Susanna (Valeria Golino).'Rain Man' is one of cinema's most touching road trip movies. As Charlie and Raymond make their way to Los Angeles' in Charlie's newly-acquired 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible (Raymond had refused to fly with any airline other than QANTAS, having committed to memory every plane crash in history), they have their own share of frustrations, with Charlie soon developing a great level of respect for Raymond's abilities. There is also a very memorable stop-off in Las Vegas, where &#150; in the movie's most exhilarating scene &#150; Raymond wins his brother more than $80,000 by counting cards in a six-deck shoe. There are also some sentimental moments, particularly when Charlie, wanting to prepare Raymond for a date he thinks he is having, teaches him how to dance.Screenwriters Ronald Bass and Barry Morrow drew their inspiration for the character of Raymond from real-life savant Kim Peek, who suffered from agenesis of the corpus callosum and was not actually autistic. Hoffman plays his character to perfection, complete with the hurried speech and the quirky tilt of the head. Other Raymond Babbitt oddities, which we all come to love, include taking photographs of random objects, watching The People's Court at four o'clock every day and reciting Abbott and Costello's Who's on First? routine whenever he is nervous. Cruise, who is often over-looked, also gives a stellar performance, with Charlie tracing a full character arc, his selfish disregard for Raymond's wellbeing gradually giving way to love and understanding.

Thus, Charlie comes to learn of Raymond Babbitt (Hoffman), his autistic savant older brother, of whom he had known nothing.

There is also a very memorable stop-off in Las Vegas, where &#150; in the movie's most exhilarating scene &#150; Raymond wins his brother more than $80,000 by counting cards in a six-deck shoe.

Hoffman plays his character to perfection, complete with the hurried speech and the quirky tilt of the head. Other Raymond Babbitt oddities, which we all come to love, include taking photographs of random objects, watching The People's Court at four o'clock every day and reciting Abbott and Costello's Who's on First? routine whenever he is nervous.

Bison (Raul Julia) kidnaps some aid workers & Allied Nations soldiers & demands $20 billion or he'll kill them. Colonel William F. Guile (Jean-Claude Van Damme) disobeys orders & decides to attack Bison's hideout & take him down, however he isn't the only one who wants to see Bison dead & various assorted character's & fighters join in to help including boxer's, sumo wrestler's, karate experts & kung-fu kicking news reporters!This American Japanese co-production (it was part financed by Capcom who made the Street Fighter games this was based on) was written & directed by Steven E. de Souza & I don't quite know what to think about it. The film is based on the very popular Street Fighter series of computer games up-to Super Street Fighter II The New Challengers (1993) which I was a big fan of & without wishing to boast was pretty darned good at & I could complete the entire game without losing a single fight! The script tries to shoehorn every character in even if they don't have a particularly large role except that of Fei Long who is the only character from the computer game that was left out (the final boss Akuma doesn't really count!) which is odd because considering this is a martial arts film I would have thought he would have been the easiest to fit in being a straight Bruce Lee homage. As a straight action flick this is pretty bad, there's actually a distinct lack of action & not that much fighting either. As a film based on a computer game it's bound to upset some who think their favourite character doesn't get to do enough or fight enough & some of the character's seem surplus to requirements & are there purely to get name-checked. Having said that this is one of those so bad it's good type films, the best comparison to it I can make is the old 60's Batman TV series as they both have a certain embarrassing camp value which makes them watchable & it only lasts for just over 90 minutes. For those who don't know keep watching as the end credits roll as once they finish there's another few minutes as Bison's hand bursts through some broken monitors & rubble on the floor.Director Souza is more used to writing big budget action films rather than directing them & it show's, the action isn't anything special & as already mentioned there's not too much fighting. Some of the computer game character's look silly on screen, Balrog in his boxing short's & gloves looks stupid & where did he get them from? Sagat doesn't look like his computer game counterpart, Vega isn't right, Blanka looks awful, Dhalsim looks nothing like his computer game persona & here they turn him into a scientist for some reason nor does T. Hawk, Dee Jay doesn't get to fight anyone although Chun-Li, Guile (played by JCVD even thought the character is American), Cammy (played by an Australian even though the character is English) & especially Bison all look good. There's nothing that violent here or particularly exciting & there's a lack of the character's special moves from the games as well.With a supposed budget of about $35,000,000 Street Fighter actually made triple that at the worldwide box-office even if it didn't deserve to. It's reasonably well made on location in Australia, Thailand & Canada & some of the sets are impressive but you can't help but cringe at the camp bits. The acting isn't that great, Raul Julia in his last film before he died is in top form, JCVD puts another nail in the coffin of his theatrical career while both Ming-Na as Chun-Li & Australian pop star & actress Kylie Minogue as Cammy are pretty hot looking.Street Fighter is one of those films I have a hard time deciding whether I liked it or not, I mean on the one hand it has a terrible story with stupid character's but on the other it's so camp & fun it's hard not to like it.

The idea of blending a buddy-cop movie with a gooey zombie flick is more obvious than you'd think, as both concepts easily lend themselves to fast & witty dialogs and ridiculously over the top spectacle. Writer Terry Black and director Mark Goldblatt grab the opportunity with both hands and they cheerfully combine all the clichéd situations and stereotypes both genres have to offer.

After a couple of encounters with criminals that just won't die no matter how many bullets are fired at them, Roger and Doug discover a link with a pharmaceutical company. Somehow they invented a machine capable to bring the dead back to life for a limited period of twelve hours, and they use them to commit crimes. There's also a much bigger scheme going on behind the walls of the conference rooms, featuring the one and only Vincent Price as the company's top guy aiming for immortality. Vincent Price living forever? It would have been awesome, but alas. Anyway, Roger is accidentally killed in action, but promptly brought back by his partner and the lovely Lindsay Frost.

Dead Heat is pretty stupid, completely lacking suspense and occasionally tedious &#133; but it sustains an irresistibly charming atmosphere from start to finish. The make-up effects (courtesy of Steve Johnson) are top notch and often outrageous, but the script should have cut back a little on Joe Piscopo's forced one-liners because they do become quite irritating after a while. Dead Heat is also a prototype product of the eighties, with crazy haircuts, colorful outfits, macho conversations held in a convertible car and awful synthesizer music.

You can take numerous examples from down the decades Does any one remember or still watch any German films before their Expressionism movement in the 1920s? What about Italian film before the 1940s or Danish films before the Dogme '95 movement? This is where Bob the Gambler is living proof that it hasn't aged that badly as we (or at least I'm) still stumbling across pre-film movement films and enjoying them for what they are.It's not just Bob the Gambler that is an example of French film and how pre-new wave French film has survived; a lot of the Lumière brothers films should be the first point of call for someone wondering where film and cinema came from; the answer is of course the French. Bob the Gambler as a film is just simply fascinating &#150; its look, its use of locations and its actual narrative just ooze class. Melville uses a very clever technique to introduce not just the characters and the setting but also the film as a whole without even touching on the story. This is done through the opening thirty or so minutes which just consists of character interaction as we discover what types of people these characters are and any other necessary information about pasts or whatever is delivered to us through dialogue. We discover a bit about Bob and his relation to the police as well as a bit on the shady past of the character of Paolo who will contribute to the plot later on since he works at the casino.But the film also consists of both outdoor and indoor scenes that are fascinating to watch. The indoor scenes for reasons just said and the outdoor scenes as more of a historical lesson if anything. This is post war Paris captured on film with cars and buildings acting as brilliant, timeless and irreplaceable mise-en-scene. And yet, Bob the Gambler has enough essence of noir, crime and innovation to keep it worth watching. There's a shot of a nipple in the film that surely would've had censors doing somersaults, several suggestions that sex has happened is implied by way of the scenes ending and there's even room for a shot from the backseat of a travelling car as the two occupants drive to their destination and maybe share a glance. Two things 1. Would a Hollywood film from the time include such a scene or just get them there without the journey and 2. The shot is eerily similar to that of the one in Goddard's 1960 film Breathless where Michael is describing what he likes about the girl sitting next to him in list form. If Melville had been a bit bolder and included some jump cuts, the New Wave would've started there and then &#150; no question.There is further proof that the film has aged well and that the director was thinking big at the time in the script. My personal favourite scene is when they're going over the heist plan and one of the robbers stands to attention as non diegetic music stars up before Bob yells at him to sit back down and then the music immediately stops. Melville toys with us once again and has fun with the soundtrack simultaneously whilst probably having a stab at Hollywood for the time. That said, the script is full of witty putdown and lines that don't advance the story but are truly 'real'; very akin to today's Hollywood films after Tarantino gave everybody permission to do so.Bob the Gambler is a number of things and utilises a number of conventions that whilst watching in today's world, seem very familiar to us thanks to recent films but this was France, mid 1950s and even more fascinating pre-French New Wave. If ever there was a film to watch in order to see what French film was like 'pre-movement', then this is it. Not one to be brushed aside.
