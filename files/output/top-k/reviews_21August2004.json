Although events played out differently, so many elements in the film are near-mirror reflections of the reality.  The attacks are carried out by Islamic extremists, whose core network were trained by the CIA, their attacks were dramatic and centered on New York City, there was little cooperation between, the FBI, CIA and military, and Arabs and Arab-Americans were rounded up in large numbers, or were subjected to harassment and violence.  The images of bodies and debris are no less shocking than the sight of people jumping to their death from the World Trade Center.  Torture was employed by US soldiers, in pursuit of terrorists.  With all of that said, even had the attacks of Sept. 11th not occurred, this would still be a tremendous film.Director Ed Zwick and actor Denzell Washington team up once again for a great one-two punch.  Denzell brings great humanity to his role as an FBI agent, charged with counter-terrorism operations and investigations.  He is aided by Tony Shalhoub, who delivers another great performance and some of the best lines.  Annette Benning displays her talent as a CIA operative at the heart of the whole crisis.  Roger Deacons adds his wonderful cinematography, and Bruce Willis turns in a fine performance as an over-zealous army general.The film delivers a cautionary tale about extreme reactions to terror and the loss of freedoms that can result from acting in anger, rather than with reason and law.  The rounding up of citizens, as depicted in the film, and the declarations of martial law, are not that far away from the provisions of the Patriot Act, which violates First Amendment rights, the right to privacy, and the right to due process.  The film suggests that by giving up these rights, or stripping them away, we become the very thing that our enemies claim we are. It suggests that that may be the terrorists true aim.This is not a crystal ball prediction of 9\/11; but it is a fine thriller.  The filmmakers did their homework and got quite a bit right.  They also extrapolated things to an extreme, but not an implausible one.  However, they delivered an excellent film, and one that should be seen and studied.

It was actually pretty decent, if a little far fetched. Giovanni Ribisi plays Seth Davis. The guy who wants to be rich, fast. He runs a 24\/7 casino out of his apartment and it's pretty funny to see customers knock on his door early in the morning to gamble. Everything is running pretty smoothly and even though his father (the judge) doesn't approve, he doesn't turn him in either. An old acquaintance stops by with a buddy. Tells Seth that they like to recruit him into their firm. Nothing is said as to WHY Seth is the right guy for the job. Maybe it's because he's running a successful casino in his apartment. Still, his friend Adam (Jamie Kennedy) and the recruiter (Greg - Nicky Katt) don't tell us why. So Seth, after cleaning Greg out of some cash at the casino table, takes the offer and head to the interview the next day. There they meet Jim (Ben Affleck) who dismisses two people right of the bat. I won't tell you why. See the movie. Affleck is excellent in these type of roles. Like his counter part Matt Damon, Ben is great at speak loud and fast with lots of emotion. He give the interviewees the load down on how to make a million dollars just 3 years. Everyone buys the pitch and it's off to training.**** Light Spoilers ****Seth does his three months of training under the mean spirited Greg who thinks that Seth is out to steal his old girlfriend Abbie (Nia Long). Even though Abbie dumped Greg weeks ago and is taking a liking to Seth. Still Greg believe that Seth is trying to step over him as Seth starts to close stock deals at a rapid rate. Everything is going smoothly until Seth becomes suspicious after seeing a co-worker who runs the books, shredding documents. Then he sees Michael (Tom Everett Scott) looking for a larger leasing office. Nothing is mention about how Michael because CEO of the company, but everyone respects his leadership none the less. When FBI agents start getting involved things turn for the worse. I won't give anymore of it away. You'll just have to see it for yourself. The only thing I didn't like about the film was the way it ended. I would have liked it to have gone on for another 10-15 mins to see what ended up happening in the office. The original ending on the DVD was even worse. Again, you really want to see the next 10-15 mins after the movie ends. Also, the premise was really far fetched. The firm seemed to have been around for a long time and I find it very hard to believe that people would buy stocks over the phone with a company that's not recognizable. Even if they are recognizable, most high stock purchasers either already have a broker or do it themselves online. Also, the people who were losing all this money would have eventually hired a detective to investigate the situation. I can see it happening, but not on the scale that was involved in the movie. Rich people aren't as dumb as the film made them out to be. I would also think that the employees calling would wonder why they are selling stock for companies that are going out of business. Also the rips - (commission) were way to high.Overall the movie is worth a rental. It's worth watching a couple of times. I own the DVD, but will probably sell it after a couple more viewings. I gave it a 7 out of 10. ","genre":null},{"date":"21 August 2004","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  Can't really say too many bad things about this movie.

But of course that's not the case.Timothy Dalton avoids the curse of Lazenby by returning for action as 007 a second, final time. He's kind of awkward in the role, not fitting the conventional Bond image, but when he isn't trying to make a rare joke, he actually benefits from this naturalistic approach. As many note, and the producers claimed before and after the film was released, this was a new kind of Bond film, one that used the Ian Fleming novels as more than title fodder. Some story nuggets in the Fleming opus turn up here, and more importantly, Bond is portrayed as a real human being with doubts and an ability to be physically and emotionally hurt, just as Fleming wrote him. Some would say this dampens the excitement level, but as any loyal Fleming reader knows, the verisimilitude only enhances it.Bond doesn't globe trot much either. He starts out in Key West and the Caribbean, then goes to Mexico, which probably is the shortest distance covered in any Bond film. Fleming didn't throw his fictional creation around that much, either, preferring to acclimate him (and the reader) to a couple of choice locales. The villains are bereft of out sized accoutrement's, just a clever drug lord and his greedy underlings. There are two women, and Bond for once is expected to choose one rather than sleep with both. Again, Fleming didn't stick Bond with more than one woman per novel, and sometimes, as in the novel Moonraker, he didn't even get her. Bond the sexual athlete arrived with Sean Connery, and in the age of AIDS, Timothy Dalton is careful in his romantic exploits.So that's all to like, as are the many twists and turns the story takes. Bond, stripped of his license to kill, sets off to revenge a friend, infiltrating a drug gang and then planting the seeds of distrust with the gang boss, Sanchez, played by Robert Davi. Other than a pet iguana, Davi isn't given much to set Sanchez apart from the many Bond super villains of yore, but Davi makes the most of the situation, playing Sanchez with real menace, a glint of humor, and a desire to find someone he can trust, which Bond plays to rather inhumanly but well.So Davi and Dalton complement each other fine, and to complete this happy triangle, there's Carey Lowell as Pam Bouvier, the best Bond girl since Barbara Bach in The Spy Who Loved Me. Making the Bond girl a competent independent woman rather than a helpless ditz has become so ingrained in the series as to become a tired cliché, but Lowell doesn't only hold her own in the action scenes, and look like a million and a half bucks in a sparkling gown, she lets you into her character with real humor and pathos.There's some great stunts, too. Bond lassos a plane from a helicopter at the opening, boards a seaplane in mid-flight in the middle, and dodges burning trucks and Stinger missiles at the end. He even gets attacked by someone wielding a stuffed marlin, which is Dalton's one real fun moment.The knock, and it's a big one, is that the story never really gels. Bond's Yojimbo-style takedown of Sanchez's enterprise is too contrived, with people that would recognize him unaccountably out of action when Bond arrives at Sanchez's casino. There's a subplot involving a Hong Kong drug plot that comes in out of left field, puts Bond on the sidelines, and then vanishes. The story feels rushed, some of the supporting players give weak performances, and bits like Wayne Newton as a televangelist, however fun, feel tacked on.Dalton was still in shakedown mode here, trying to figure out where he fit in on a once-great franchise suddenly out of favor with the fickle masses and in need of reeling in the excess silliness of the later Roger Moore films. He looks uncomfortable. My sense is Dalton didn't like playing 007; he didn't seem to want the role after this and declined to participate in the 1999 DVD re-release (a very nice package, by the way, especially as there is real candor in the reminiscences and some obvious enthusiasm in the accounts given by Lowell, Davi, and Benicio Del Toro, the future Oscar winner who had his first memorable role in Licence To Kill as Sanchez's faithful henchman).Dalton was a film away in my opinion from redefining James Bond as a true movie hero of the 1990s, not in the glitzy, soulless way Pierce Brosnan later employed, but as a hero you could really root for and empathize with. Licence To Kill shows that starting to happen, and for Fleming fans like myself, that's exciting to see. But the end result was a film that failed to find an audience, and a long six-year hiatus that nearly killed the series. Careful what you wish for, fellow Flemingites...

Bond, stripped of his license to kill, sets off to revenge a friend, infiltrating a drug gang and then planting the seeds of distrust with the gang boss, Sanchez, played by Robert Davi. Other than a pet iguana, Davi isn't given much to set Sanchez apart from the many Bond super villains of yore, but Davi makes the most of the situation, playing Sanchez with real menace, a glint of humor, and a desire to find someone he can trust, which Bond plays to rather inhumanly but well.So Davi and Dalton complement each other fine, and to complete this happy triangle, there's Carey Lowell as Pam Bouvier, the best Bond girl since Barbara Bach in The Spy Who Loved Me. Making the Bond girl a competent independent woman rather than a helpless ditz has become so ingrained in the series as to become a tired cliché, but Lowell doesn't only hold her own in the action scenes, and look like a million and a half bucks in a sparkling gown, she lets you into her character with real humor and pathos.There's some great stunts, too. Bond lassos a plane from a helicopter at the opening, boards a seaplane in mid-flight in the middle, and dodges burning trucks and Stinger missiles at the end. He even gets attacked by someone wielding a stuffed marlin, which is Dalton's one real fun moment.The knock, and it's a big one, is that the story never really gels. Bond's Yojimbo-style takedown of Sanchez's enterprise is too contrived, with people that would recognize him unaccountably out of action when Bond arrives at Sanchez's casino. There's a subplot involving a Hong Kong drug plot that comes in out of left field, puts Bond on the sidelines, and then vanishes. The story feels rushed, some of the supporting players give weak performances, and bits like Wayne Newton as a televangelist, however fun, feel tacked on.Dalton was still in shakedown mode here, trying to figure out where he fit in on a once-great franchise suddenly out of favor with the fickle masses and in need of reeling in the excess silliness of the later Roger Moore films. He looks uncomfortable. My sense is Dalton didn't like playing 007; he didn't seem to want the role after this and declined to participate in the 1999 DVD re-release (a very nice package, by the way, especially as there is real candor in the reminiscences and some obvious enthusiasm in the accounts given by Lowell, Davi, and Benicio Del Toro, the future Oscar winner who had his first memorable role in Licence To Kill as Sanchez's faithful henchman).Dalton was a film away in my opinion from redefining James Bond as a true movie hero of the 1990s, not in the glitzy, soulless way Pierce Brosnan later employed, but as a hero you could really root for and empathize with. Licence To Kill shows that starting to happen, and for Fleming fans like myself, that's exciting to see. But the end result was a film that failed to find an audience, and a long six-year hiatus that nearly killed the series. Careful what you wish for, fellow Flemingites...

The biggest problem was understanding the dialogue and building upon the scenes that were replaced with brief narrative (as they were omitted to get the runtime down), was something that failed to help the movie. But alas, this movie is definitely unique in a positive way. There are several reasons for this. The first is that David Lynch is directing it and it is a Dino de laryngitis production with a good budget for that movie era. Its a shame that Lynch's presence isn't appreciated more for his mainly non-linear filmaking brilliance, as is shown very much on this film.This was Kyle McLachlan's first movie and although the character of Paul is meant to be about 15 as in the book, wheras Kyle was 24 when making the movie doesn't matter the slightest. I hope Kyle is very proud of his contribution in the movie for it was him who kept me going the first time I ever watched it. He looked right physically in the role and was convincing form the start. In fact the casting is prefect in this movie. Compared to film failures such as Escape from LA, which also had a great cast despite being a very poor movie, this film tops other mentionable pictures.I liked the way the story unraveled and Patrick Stewart's involvement even though he didn't have much screen time. Everett McGill impressed me in this as he was excellent in Under Siege 2. My good points could go on for a bit but there is always going to be bad points to DUNE. It was a shame it bommed at the box making under half its supposed budget, but i can understand entirely as this movie isn't for the average movie-goer who expects everything to be clear the first time. What on earth happened to Virginia Madsen in this movie, shes hardly here and she stood out as mesmerisingly beautiful. I cannot decide whether Sting was good or bad in his role but he appeared well on screen.My greatest regret was that this film wasn't made into two parts so that more scenes could have been used to build up characters, but where would be a good point to break the story up as it is quite a simple one? Cutting the film to 137 minutes upset Lynch very much but he still remained dedicated. I think if it was longer that it wouldn't have made any bigger an impression in theaters or improve the cult following. A few things were changed there and then too during the movie but it is still quite faithful to Herbert's vision of DUNE. I hope that the full intended version makes it out one day but this current region 2 DVD release will OK enough for the moment. Musician Toto again was a good choice for the music in the movie giving a feel good element. Considering the movie was made in 1983, the effects are OK but noticeably dated as computer technology weren't on hand so much if at all back then. This was evident during some battle scenes but as in the theatrical release they were all short and so didn't cause much of a problem as it could of had.This movie is a like it or hate it affair, there ain't an in between, so you will feel either bitter disappointment or the thought that movie was different and good. I didn't read the book first but found it OK then, but i recommend you read the book and see the full picture as it was much clearer watching it after. Well done to actors and crew on this film.Rating *** out of *****, a bizarre sci-fi film with good moments and acting, which overall ruled over the films various bad points.

There seems to be nowhere near as much substance to this film unlike its wonderful predecessor, however again the intelligent dialogue from the second Trek film is also present here and it was wonderful to see the return of another character from the original series played by the same actor, this time Mark Lenard as Spock's father and Vulcan Ambassador Sarek.The special effects are turned out well even though the seemingly endless Genesis planet gradually disintegrating scenes started to grate after a while.

Air traffic control is, statistically, the most stressful job in the world, and if you don't believe me; watch Keenan and Kel and see how highly strung Keenan's dad is! However, life is good for Nick; he has a beautiful wife (Cate Blanchett), his friend's think he's great. he's never made a mistake in his job and he holds the 'world record' for the most amount of balls through a basketball net in succession. Great. All that changes, however when the cold Russell Bell turns up at headquarters. Simply put; Bell is better than Falzone. He can hold a lit match for longer, he's better at basketball than Nick, he's a better singer and, worst of all, he has a younger, more beautiful wife (Angelina Jolie, later his wife in real life). Nick Falzone, is not a happy camper.Pushing Tin is a film about the male ego. The focus of the movie is always on the struggle between Nick and Russell. This is epitomised best in the hilarious sequence in which Nick is driving Russell to a restaurant. He's swerving about all over the road, weaving in and out of traffic, trying to impress Russell; only to look over to find him asleep. Pushing Tin features several moments of rib tickling humour, but also a lot of the more cerebral humour, which you'll either find hilarious or miss. As a comedy, this film works.John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, Angelina Jolie and Cate Blanchett; Pushing Tin features a great cast. They all perform their roles well, too. John Cusack in particular. He's a great actor, he's proved time and time again that he has the ability to carry a film by himself with his charm and good looks, and although he's not on his own here; it is one of his best performances. The characters in Pushing Tin are rather well done, especially as I was expecting this to be a John Cusack vehicle. Aside from being a comedy, the film is also a character study; one which studies the character of a male that has always had everything his way, when he's not getting his way anymore. The story, although comically overblown, does ring true to life of this type of situation. That's where the film draws most of it's humour from; it's the fact that the audience can relate to a lot of the stuff in this film that makes it funny.Overall, Pushing Tin is a very nice movie. It's finale is overblown, and the film is slightly overlong, but it's also a very funny character study that won't fail to generate a few laughs.

After a chanceless expedition to find something worthwhile, 'Identity' and 'The Big Kahuna' were the only two movies we nominated. We flipped a coin and it was heads, so we rented 'The Big Kahuna'. Alright, Kevin Spacey, Danny de Vito, what could go wrong? During the first 15 minutes of the movie, it felt it could turn out good, although the constant blabbering of Spacey's character started to annoy. Three guys two marketing veterans, De Vito and Spacey, and a new guy, in a hotel room planning a reception to get some big cheese business guy to use their lubricants.
