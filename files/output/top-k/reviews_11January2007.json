Neo learns from Morpheus that he has been living in a completely fabricated reality known as the Matrix; a computer generated dream world created by an advanced artificial cybernetic intelligence system&#151;that now rules Earth&#151;for the sole purpose of keeping humans blissfully content as they are unknowingly grown in endless fields and then harvested for the energy that their bodies emit&#151;as they are transformed into batteries for the machines.

So he abandons his back-country life and treks to New York in search of glory. He thinks he has everything planned out and upon arriving in the vast city his plan to be a hustler goes array and he finds himself in poverty with the most unlikely of companions Ratso Rizzo. Joe Buck realises that many things have being missing from his life, he soon is opened up to the harsh reality of life and what he needs to come to terms with.Midnight Cowboy is a fascinating story, brimming with the countless, memorable occurrences showing the spiralling downfall of a life that was destined to end in sadness.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"11 January 2007","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" I watched 2001 when I was twelve years old and despised it. I held such low regard for the film that I vowed to never watch it again for the rest of my life. I suppose I forgot that promise I made, as curiosity got the better of me and I revisited Kubrick's film this past summer when I was 19. I think two things are critical for viewing this movie, two things which as a twelve year old I did not possess patience and a willingness to be open to where the story goes. 2001 is the most different film you will see in your life. Whenever I talk to someone who has seen it, we both find ourselves at a loss for words as to what the film was ultimately about or what it meant to us. Some might say that indicates a failure on the lack of the filmmaker, but I am inclined to disagree. I think Stanley Kubrick was wholly successful in fostering a sense of wonder and the desire to question our existence in the film, and I believe that he left the other themes as somewhat ambiguous so the audience could decide for themselves what they meant to them. I enjoyed the film on numerous levels. First, it was a brilliant slice of history- I love to watch movies that make an effort to realistically portray the future. No matter how hard they try, they always have a strong contemporary influence that might be unnoticeable at the time, but is very apparent later on. In 2001 this is certainly the case, but it delightful. There is so much optimism with the presentation of the space station, so much hope at what we might accomplish, that one is easily able to overlook the dated brand logos and garish furniture. I found an immense charm to every aspect of the universe presented in this film. It is clear that painstaking thought and detail went into the creation of every set, every prop and every interaction in the film. Which brings me to my next point. Kids will have trouble watching this movie because it is so sparse on dialogue, and plodding in its presentation. One must surrender themselves to the film and accept the fact that the movie is forcing us to view something in a completely new way. Because much of the movie is so quiet, it leaves the viewer a great deal of time to think. And more importantly, it makes the viewer pay close attention to the moments where there are dialogue and action. Because the film forces the viewer to focus in a completely new way, it makes them remember what happened in the film with much greater intensity. All modern filmmakers should remember that economy is an important thing, and that often having less leaves you with more. Truer words could not be ascribed to 2001. It has been more than six months since I last saw it, and yet I remember it with greater clarity than any film I've seen since, and find myself turning back to it and questioning what it was all about, questioning why I felt the way I did. The mark of an excellent film is one that causes you to reference it again and again in your thoughts without the outside stimulation of having to see something that will remind you of it. 2001 is sublime. It transcends what any other film has accomplished. It shows the evolution of mankind and as a result, is a very spiritual journey. This is not just some science fiction film as many would be led to believe by the fragments that popular culture has latched on to, like HAL and the space station. This is a film that documents each stage in the history of mankind, from prehistoric, to contemporary, to the ever distant future. I asks so many questions- what is the meaning of life? why do we value our existence? does one man really matter? why do we feel happy or sad? why do we care about other people? what separates man from machine? is there significance to human life in light of the enormity of the universe? where will we go after death? is there such a thing as regeneration? So many questions, and so many questions that one should ask all the time. An unexamined life is not worth living as PLato (I believe) once said. 2001 wants us to examine our lives. It wants us to think outside of our bodies and question our values and our biases. It is not a preachy film- nowhere, and may I stress this, nowhere does it tell the viewer what to hink, or make any insinuations about what the audience should be interpreting or feeling. This is a film for everyone to possess and call their own. Everyone can have an opinion about what this film is about, and no one would be wrong. It is for each person watching 2001 to decide what it =means to them. This is an experience to be shared and appreciated. I cannot believe that 2001 was made in the studio system, but it was, and it's a credit to a different era that it was made and released. It is an exquisite experience, with truly stunning special effects, all of which hold up today, and in many cases, are superior to cgi. I think it's a good thing when the viewer asks themselves, How did they do that? With cgi, this mysterious element disappears, and one can explain it away with computers. The fact that 2001 was made without the assistance of modern film-making tools makes it even more of a marvel.I love it, and I hope you see it and take the time to think about it too.

Some might say that indicates a failure on the lack of the filmmaker, but I am inclined to disagree. I think Stanley Kubrick was wholly successful in fostering a sense of wonder and the desire to question our existence in the film, and I believe that he left the other themes as somewhat ambiguous so the audience could decide for themselves what they meant to them. I enjoyed the film on numerous levels. First, it was a brilliant slice of history- I love to watch movies that make an effort to realistically portray the future. No matter how hard they try, they always have a strong contemporary influence that might be unnoticeable at the time, but is very apparent later on. In 2001 this is certainly the case, but it delightful. There is so much optimism with the presentation of the space station, so much hope at what we might accomplish, that one is easily able to overlook the dated brand logos and garish furniture. I found an immense charm to every aspect of the universe presented in this film. It is clear that painstaking thought and detail went into the creation of every set, every prop and every interaction in the film. Which brings me to my next point. Kids will have trouble watching this movie because it is so sparse on dialogue, and plodding in its presentation. One must surrender themselves to the film and accept the fact that the movie is forcing us to view something in a completely new way. Because much of the movie is so quiet, it leaves the viewer a great deal of time to think. And more importantly, it makes the viewer pay close attention to the moments where there are dialogue and action. Because the film forces the viewer to focus in a completely new way, it makes them remember what happened in the film with much greater intensity. All modern filmmakers should remember that economy is an important thing, and that often having less leaves you with more. Truer words could not be ascribed to 2001. It has been more than six months since I last saw it, and yet I remember it with greater clarity than any film I've seen since, and find myself turning back to it and questioning what it was all about, questioning why I felt the way I did. The mark of an excellent film is one that causes you to reference it again and again in your thoughts without the outside stimulation of having to see something that will remind you of it. 2001 is sublime. It transcends what any other film has accomplished. It shows the evolution of mankind and as a result, is a very spiritual journey. This is not just some science fiction film as many would be led to believe by the fragments that popular culture has latched on to, like HAL and the space station. This is a film that documents each stage in the history of mankind, from prehistoric, to contemporary, to the ever distant future. I asks so many questions- what is the meaning of life? why do we value our existence? does one man really matter? why do we feel happy or sad? why do we care about other people? what separates man from machine? is there significance to human life in light of the enormity of the universe? where will we go after death? is there such a thing as regeneration? So many questions, and so many questions that one should ask all the time. An unexamined life is not worth living as PLato (I believe) once said. 2001 wants us to examine our lives. It wants us to think outside of our bodies and question our values and our biases. It is not a preachy film- nowhere, and may I stress this, nowhere does it tell the viewer what to hink, or make any insinuations about what the audience should be interpreting or feeling. This is a film for everyone to possess and call their own. Everyone can have an opinion about what this film is about, and no one would be wrong. It is for each person watching 2001 to decide what it =means to them. This is an experience to be shared and appreciated. I cannot believe that 2001 was made in the studio system, but it was, and it's a credit to a different era that it was made and released. It is an exquisite experience, with truly stunning special effects, all of which hold up today, and in many cases, are superior to cgi. I think it's a good thing when the viewer asks themselves, How did they do that? With cgi, this mysterious element disappears, and one can explain it away with computers. The fact that 2001 was made without the assistance of modern film-making tools makes it even more of a marvel.I love it, and I hope you see it and take the time to think about it too.

Also, the reporter has dreams of her father, who died in Vietnam. And the origin of Pinhead! Some people consider this one the best in the series. I am not one of those people. While there are many great aspects of this movie, the primitive special effects seem to subtract from the overall story. And continuing in the Hellraiser tradition, many things simply do not make sense. Who opened the art store? Where did the statue come from? Why does the statue not attack JP at first, but will later on?As I say, the special effects are primitive. And I do not mind that, because at least they put in a solid offering. But some things just seem like they could have been done better. In Hellraiser parts 1 and 2, there was no problem creating a person without skin that looked creepy. We see another example in this film, but they also get slurped into a statue and this is very unconvincing. In 1992! The effects of the original Nightmare on Elm Street blow this out of the water. Others have complained about the cenobites looking like Borg rejects, and that is a fair point -- this film goes above and beyond in incorporating terrible ideas into cenobite bodies.Terry Farrell does a fine job as the lead. She is a strong heroine, and unlike your typical horror woman, she has more brains than body. You might recognize Farrell as a character from the greatest sitcom on television in recent years, Becker. The plot is respectable. There really was no more story to tell about the Cotton family at this point. Moving on to show what lengths evil will go to in order to return to Earth was a good change. And brought to us by Peter Atkins (also the writer of part 4) and Anthony Hickox (who directed the incredible Waxwork films).I do not care for the change in direction the films take from here, though, regarding the cenobites. I understand after explaining Pinhead's origin (something I am very thankful for) they opened the door for more cenobites, but this film and the fourth introduce some of the lamest characters with the lamest one-liners. The subplot of the father is okay, but also makes the Hellraiser mythology even more complex than it is... now we have Hell, Earth, the mind, who can and cannot touch the Lament Configuration... oy vey.Obviously when a horror series gets going, the sequels are not going to be what the original was. You get paler and paler copies of the original (like Multiplicity).

That said though very few films have been carried by the visual trickery alone, Episode V could not simply have been an effects driven film as this would have meant that it offered nothing new to the Star Wars saga. I do, though, love the visual effects in this film. In my opinion they are the best of any of the six episodes my reasoning for this is that although you can tell a few things have been faked it is nothing like episodes I, II and III where nothing looks real due to excessive and often unnecessary use of CGI.Brilliant as the effects are though they never upstage the actors (as they do in subsequent Star Wars films). Mark Hamill is at his most convincing in Episode V this though, I think, is largely due to a script that gives his character much more depth than in Episode IV. The conflicts within Luke are very well played out, his frustration with Yoda, his inability to control the force and his eventual recklessness in choosing to face Vader, without completing his training, present the very real prospect that he might succumb to the dark side - indeed when I first saw this film I felt Luke would have no choice but to submit to Vader after their duel on Bespin.Elsewhere the love story between Han and Leia develops gradually becomes more intense as the film progresses. There is the hilarious verbal sparing whilst the battle rages on Hoth followed by the tender scene on the Falcon in the asteroid field where Han and Leia admit their feelings for one another. All this builds up to the highly charged scenes in Cloud City where Leia expresses doubts about Han's staying power before accepting, as Han is about to be frozen, that she loves him (which of course he knew anyway!). I would say that Harrison Ford gives his best performance as Han Solo in Episode V as he actually has his own story line where as in Epiosde IV he is almost there for delivering (great) one-liners whilst he cuts a bit of a peripheral figure in Episode VI Perhaps what I love most about this film though is the more subtle touches and the little things that make the whole thing real and something that you can relate too. For example I love that moment where Han Solo hits the Falcon's control panel after it fails to light up - haven't we all been there?. Then there's the constant bickering that occurs (especially between Han and Leia) that makes the characters so real. Meanwhile Vader is at his most menacing - proving that the empire has most certainly struck back. Although at the end when Admiral Piett is expecting to be swiftly executed after the escape of the Millennium Falcon (as Admiral Ozell and Captain Niedhar were before him). However Vader chooses to let Piett be cleverly suggesting that Vader's meeting with Luke has altered Vader substantially an advertising that often actions speak louder than words.The only problem with this film (apart from being at the whim of George Lucas) is that you really need to see episodes IV and IV to fully understand it therefore meaning that as a stand alone film it's not quite as perfect as it is in the context of the other films in the saga. Indeed if you read my comment you'll probably see that most of my observations are relative to the other Star Wars film. However as episodes IV and VI are great films you've really nothing to lose by watching the whole lot. Oh did I mention it has quite possibly the best twist in cinema history?

That said though very few films have been carried by the visual trickery alone, Episode V could not simply have been an effects driven film as this would have meant that it offered nothing new to the Star Wars saga. I do, though, love the visual effects in this film. In my opinion they are the best of any of the six episodes my reasoning for this is that although you can tell a few things have been faked it is nothing like episodes I, II and III where nothing looks real due to excessive and often unnecessary use of CGI.Brilliant as the effects are though they never upstage the actors (as they do in subsequent Star Wars films). Mark Hamill is at his most convincing in Episode V this though, I think, is largely due to a script that gives his character much more depth than in Episode IV. The conflicts within Luke are very well played out, his frustration with Yoda, his inability to control the force and his eventual recklessness in choosing to face Vader, without completing his training, present the very real prospect that he might succumb to the dark side - indeed when I first saw this film I felt Luke would have no choice but to submit to Vader after their duel on Bespin.Elsewhere the love story between Han and Leia develops gradually becomes more intense as the film progresses.

She is a television-and-choco-holic, who takes to watching a continuous infomercial about improving your life. Her son, Harry--played by Jared Leto--is a junkie of sorts, who resorts to stealing her television every week or so. He hauls it on down to the pawnbroker (in one of the most beautiful title sequences I've seen) with the help of his friend, Tyrone C. Love. They get their cash, they get their pot.However, these two men are humans. Both have a love interest. Marion Silver, played by Jennefer Connelly, is Harry's girlfriend. They love each other in a very real and heartbreaking way. Tyrone has his woman as well, although we don't get to know her very well through the course of the movie.But things begin to spiral out of control. Sara is tricked by a telemarketer into thinking that she could appear on the Tappy Tibbons show that she watches so much. She obsesses about adorning her red dress--but it won't zip up all the way. So she seeks a doctor about some weight pills. Thus begins Sara's disintegration.Marion and Harry, on the other hand, are dreaming about opening a clothing store. Harry sees that if he gets money from the drugs he has, they could scrounge up enough to open their business together, along with the help of Tyrone. But they get hooked on the pot--and here begins their story.All of this comes crashing down in one of the most gut-wrenching climaxes in movie history.Aronofsky's use of subjective imagery, camera speed techniques, and fast cutting gets us deep into the heads of our characters. Characters that, in fact, we are with all the way through. His images portray an accurate and miserable world of drug addiction, sexuality, and desperation. Mattew Libatique uses hue change and color filters to give us different feelings throughout the three different seasons (or acts) of the movie.The performances by the actors are absolutely flabbergasting. Ellen Burstyn's Acadamy Award loss was, perhaps, a crime. Her performance was so powerful and radiated sympathy for her character, the sweet and lovable Mrs. Goldfarb. It is truly frightening to see what she is reduced to by the end of the film. Jared Leto and Jennefer Connely give all-star performances as well. They are truly in love during this movie. They convey such realism. You identify with them from the start. Marlon Wayans also acts very well in here, too--proving that he can do more than stupid comedies. His dramatic acting is astounding to see, especially if you watch 'Little Man' right before this.An honorable mention goes to Mr. Clint Mansell, the composer, as well as the Kronos Quartet, for delivering one hell of an emotional score. It is currently a very popular soundtrack, and rightfully so.Overall, this is a hard-hitting and on-the-nose kind of film that only comes along once in a while.

And at the heart of the film, at the end of the stinking river of murder and mayhem, lies Kurtz (a god-like Brando).The making of this colossal film was long, chaotic, painful and sufficiently well chronicled in the excellent documentary Hearts of Darkness not to be retold in this review. Suffice to say that it is a miracle that the film survived, and even benefited from its troubled conception. The unconventional editing and Vittorio Storraro's glorious saturated photography make this feel halfway between a nightmare and an acid trip. In short, it is a journey into hell, that begins with a storm of fire and ends in the devil's den.The most telling moment of this film is of a siege against an unseen enemy, where Willlard encounters a raving soldier and asks him who is in charge, to which the soldier shrugs Ain't it you?. Apocalypse Now is every civilization's nightmare that a war justified in a distant past would degenerate so foully, that men are reduced to less than animals.One of the best and most unsettling films of all time.

The fact that Raimi directed this was a warning; he is one of those horror-film directors like Romero and Hooper who started off with a major classic (or classics), then went mediocre. The bigger warning was that Billy Joe-Bob Thornton co-scripted this piece of tedium. Billy-Ray Joe-Bob Thornton is a man of the South, but he seems to have sold himself to the Hollywood Establishment. He has co-written a story about a Southern town where men beat their wives, fathers molest their sons, their sons then burn them with gasoline, and sheriffs who pay more attention to their supplies of dough-nuts than a murder investigation (i.e. the obligatory cop dough-nut gag). Billy-Bob portrays the South in a similarly loathing way as most Hollywood writers\/directors. What gives? (Ironic, how the decadent Hollywood finds so much bone to pick with the moral fiber of the American South.) The movie also makes a cardinal sin of being a horror drama &#150; a very tough genre to be successful in. By not being a straight-out horror film the movie indirectly sells the idea of fortune-telling as a valid ability. This is supported even more by an ambivalent attitude of the locals towards Blanchett the psychic. Billy-Bob and his new Hollywood friends feel superior to these semi-skeptical locals; in the meantime, every other Hollywood moron visits a psychic and think that that's so New Age and hip, not to mention intellectually sound.Apart from being very dull, with its clichéd elements of tiresome drama, this forgettable horror drama (thriller even?) also suffers from some rather idiotic casting. A whole bunch of totally unsouthern-looking actors are cast as white trash or thereabouts Blanchett - an English woman - plays a poor Southern psychic. What idiot cast HER?! Keanu plays a violent white-trash husband with a funny Elvis accent. His character is so ridiculously over-violent that one has to wonder how come he isn't already serving time for a killing spree; he is constantly shouting, threatening, or hitting someone - literally all the time (a sad, over-used ploy to make someone seem like the obvious culprit; as if I'd fall for that cheap shtick). Kinnear is another unsouthern face, and the ultimate killer; but, of course - the Agatha Christie school of thought make the most innocent-seeming person the killer.

As Michael begins studying the area with research partner Jake, (Mario Van Peebles) he comes to believe that the shark that killed their family has arrived in the Bahamas and is stalking them. Not wanting to tell Ellen about it, as she's more concerned with her romance with local flier Hoagie Newcombe, (Michael Caine) they keep it a secret and decide to start studying the shark instead. When it finally becomes apparent to the community that there is a killer shark in the waters, they race to stop it from attacking the rest of the community.The Good News There isn't a whole lot to really like in this one. The few attacks the shark has aren't all that bad. The opening attack, where a victim has their arm ripped off, is then chomped on and bitten savagely before being pulled underwater and disappearing below, is quite stunning and really shocking. The viciousness of it really gets hammered home, and it sets up a really great opening for the film. A later attack on a crowded beach, where a victim is snagged off a marine toy in front of a small group of kids is really a great sequence, mainly for it's cruelty and viciousness than anything else. Making it go after little children is a chilling thought, and the fact that it almost takes one offers up endless possibilities, and that is a great sign. The concluding scene in the sequence, where the shark proceeds to devour the victim in full view of the witnesses, and then to violently do so with a lot of blood spilling into the water and the ferocious chomps heard in the background of the scene hit far more effectively. The chase sequence in the sunken galleon does have an air of suspense scattered through it, as the shark does manage to constantly get at the victim after every possible method is used to put distance between them. The shot of it breaking through a wall with mouth agape and bite the ladder in between the two is a really nice bit, and it does have some stalking set-ups in it, and that doesn't really make it all that bad. There might be some enjoyment for this beyond the scenes, as there is a large helping of cheese involved, and that could appeal to all sorts of film-goers who enjoy films of that manner. Beyond these three scenes, though, there wasn't much to really like about it.The Bad News There is a lot to really dislike in this one. The film's utmost flaw is that the film has the most unbelievable and nonsensical plots ever. Beyond the fact that sharks are incapable of living in the location chosen, the fact that it manages to get to there in a rather short amount of time is very hard to believe. There's also the family history about the sharks that the film brings up. Using the film, the shark is in fact the first film's third cousin twice removed, and would have no motive to carry out the vengeance issued. That, assumes, that the utterance about it is correct, and if it isn't, then it's even more off in terms of where the shark falls in the family circle. This doesn't make any sense and really has no purpose in the film. The other big mistake in the film, beyond trying to figure out where the shark in question comes from, is the very slow pacing involved. Scenes drag on for far too long or have no reason to be there other than padding out the length. The biggest one is the family quarrels about being in the water. It was done nicely enough in the film, then it happens twice in about a half an hour span, and nothing comes of them since they all go into the water afterward. The struggling marriage scenes have no bearing on the plot and seem needlessly thrown in as well. The one scene that really just drags is the beach dedication ceremony. It sets up an important plot point, so it can't be removed, but the speeches go on forever and repeat themselves a couple times, going over their words as if they're stream-of-conscious rants. There is a couple of other big problems in the film, the biggest of which is that the film feels really flat. In fact, the film flat out ignores all opportunities to create tension or fear. Just about all the attack scenes seem perfunctorily rushed and no effort is whatsoever made to make them frightening or even suspenseful. The ending, which should've been a big rousing affair to finish off the shark once and for all, plays out really flatly, and the stupidity found within has no bearing on that. The final showdown is ruined by the stupidity, which becomes a hindrance rather than a blessing like before, and it brings what would've been a stand-out scene really just hum-drum. And finally, the shark does look really fake, and there's really no scenes where it looks the slightest real. It simply floats along with minimal movement, being even more distracting. This really wasn't all that great.The Final Verdict While this isn't a train wreck as so often has been claimed, it's by no means a classic either. Most of the problems can be overlooked, but some of them are so hard to do so that it becomes a stumbling point for the movie, and some can be irrecoverable for certain people, so take caution with this no matter if you choose to see it or not.Rated PG-13 Violence, Language and children in danger ","genre":null},{"date":"11 January 2007","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Jaws The Revenge is a really terrible shark film with a few bright spots within.**SPOILERS**After the death of her son, Ellen Brody, (Lorraine Gary) decides to go visit her other son Michael, (Lance Guest) his wife Carla, (Karen Young) and daughter Thea, (Judith Barsi) where they live in the Bahamas.

But at peace? No. Jimmy Stewart, playing a gritty photographer, sleeps in his wheel-chair, the victim of some car racing accident, the result of his attempting to obtain an extraordinary picture. Now he's fettered by a cast as the result of this daring attempt. A shadow moves over his sleeping body. Is it malevolent? A rival come to enact revenge? Or the grim reaper come to take Stewart's soul? NO! It is none other than the 1950's goddess of cinema, Grace Kelly replete with white gown, scarf and gloves. She moves over the drowsy photographer and plants a kiss on his lips. The shadow is not a monster at all but an angel from Hollywood Heaven. Stewart has died and gone to eternal Paradise where he will love and worship Princess Grace for eternity! But for most of the movie he doesn't quite realize that Kelly is a beautiful gift, even beautifully wrapped!There are films, both old and new, which boast a cast of thousands and shot in 5 different continents. Well, there are few feature-length films that were shot only on one sound state. And maybe none that I know of whose primary shots are essentially a handful of camera angles from a single vantage point on that one sound stage. Yet this is what Hitchcock does to tell a very compelling story. And the viewpoint is a laid-up photographer played brilliantly by Jimmy Stewart who has nothing better to do than watch people through his rear window.The focus is Stewart's suspicion of criminal acts by one of his neighbors who he can see across the way with either his binoculars or his camera with zoom lens. His suspicion is aroused through his habit of innocently spying on the the inhabitants of the buildings on his block. What's interesting is the amount of mileage Hitchcock attains from telling a story from this peculiar vantage point in the form of other sub-stories. There is the woman on the bottom-floor of the apartment across the way who can't seem to find the right man, dubbed Miss Lonely Heart. There is another younger woman, a dancer, who can't seem to keep men away from her. She is named Miss Torso. A songwriter and\/or composer lives in another apartment. A newlywed couple move in to another apartment. As the story unfolds, the other stories unfold as well in different ways. And in addition to the main story, most of the other stories have some sort of resolution by the end of the film.This cinematic concept is one of the most innovative techniques ever backed by a major film studio. Stewart is perfectly cast as the husky photographer turned amateur sleuth. Grace Kelly who only seems to get better with each viewing, plays Stewart's desperate girlfriend who is involved in the fashion industry on Madison Avenue. The characters seem made for each other like Dracula and sunlight. She loves the glitz and glamorous life of the sophisticated fashion crowd on Madison Avenue while he seems more at home crawling in the mud of another country to get the photograph of a lifetime. Thelma Ritter keeps Stewart in check as the reluctant nurse who tries to get him to take the plunge with Kelly and also gets caught up in the mystery. And Raymond Burr plays the man across the way to whom Stewart focuses his attention. His unsmiling haunting expressions are enough to portray his secretive character.This is an absolute masterpiece of film-making. The dialog is fun, witty, sarcastic, with constant innuendos about love and marriage. Kelly plays the straight-man while Stewart get's away with lines that he'd be lynched for today by women's groups. The only thing that doesn't make sense why is Stewart so reluctant to tie the knot with Kelly? Grace Kelly was probably the Cary Grant of actresses in the 1950's with millions of males looking on with absolute jealousy of her leading men. (I'm sure many men's heart went bust when she became Princess Grace) Of course, Stewart sees her as too perfect, too beautiful, and too smart for him. Ironically, the more he pushes her away the more she wants to come back to him. Which does point to one of the strangest foibles of the human psyche when someone can't quite have something that he or she wants, the more he or she wants it!

No. Jimmy Stewart, playing a gritty photographer, sleeps in his wheel-chair, the victim of some car racing accident, the result of his attempting to obtain an extraordinary picture. Now he's fettered by a cast as the result of this daring attempt. A shadow moves over his sleeping body. Is it malevolent? A rival come to enact revenge? Or the grim reaper come to take Stewart's soul? NO! It is none other than the 1950's goddess of cinema, Grace Kelly replete with white gown, scarf and gloves. She moves over the drowsy photographer and plants a kiss on his lips. The shadow is not a monster at all but an angel from Hollywood Heaven. Stewart has died and gone to eternal Paradise where he will love and worship Princess Grace for eternity! But for most of the movie he doesn't quite realize that Kelly is a beautiful gift, even beautifully wrapped!There are films, both old and new, which boast a cast of thousands and shot in 5 different continents. Well, there are few feature-length films that were shot only on one sound state. And maybe none that I know of whose primary shots are essentially a handful of camera angles from a single vantage point on that one sound stage. Yet this is what Hitchcock does to tell a very compelling story. And the viewpoint is a laid-up photographer played brilliantly by Jimmy Stewart who has nothing better to do than watch people through his rear window.The focus is Stewart's suspicion of criminal acts by one of his neighbors who he can see across the way with either his binoculars or his camera with zoom lens. His suspicion is aroused through his habit of innocently spying on the the inhabitants of the buildings on his block. What's interesting is the amount of mileage Hitchcock attains from telling a story from this peculiar vantage point in the form of other sub-stories. There is the woman on the bottom-floor of the apartment across the way who can't seem to find the right man, dubbed Miss Lonely Heart. There is another younger woman, a dancer, who can't seem to keep men away from her. She is named Miss Torso. A songwriter and\/or composer lives in another apartment. A newlywed couple move in to another apartment. As the story unfolds, the other stories unfold as well in different ways. And in addition to the main story, most of the other stories have some sort of resolution by the end of the film.This cinematic concept is one of the most innovative techniques ever backed by a major film studio. Stewart is perfectly cast as the husky photographer turned amateur sleuth. Grace Kelly who only seems to get better with each viewing, plays Stewart's desperate girlfriend who is involved in the fashion industry on Madison Avenue. The characters seem made for each other like Dracula and sunlight. She loves the glitz and glamorous life of the sophisticated fashion crowd on Madison Avenue while he seems more at home crawling in the mud of another country to get the photograph of a lifetime.

I'm only writing because I was so appalled by it watching it the second time (the first being in the theater some years back). Watching it last evening, I couldn't get through the first sixty minutes and had to turn it off (this rarely happens). The book, which I'd read between my first viewing and the ill-fated second, is an amazing exploration of the decay of an American era and the explosive domestic drama that results thereof, in a world where physical reality and society (personified in the film by the Church primarily) collide. It is a book about men and our inability to access women, thus also our emotionally gooey sides. It is a tragedy in that great tradition, so much so that the tragedy within the narrative transcends the narrative itself to comment on a greater tragedy... which is what good art can do.But we get none of that from this train wreck of an adaptation. Which is really a shame.Coppola instead opted to present a nostalgic view of an era, lingering on what I think are meant to be humorous shots of out-of-date cars and suburbia... bored moments of awkwardness... first kisses... Basically it looks like an after school special or a long but semi-serious episode of Saved by the Bell. She presents a view that (and this is the great failure) sympathizes clearly with the inscrutable sisters when the text of the book in no way even accesses the character of these sisters. That's the problem. These girls aren't supposed to be sympathetic. They're inscrutable. Lux isn't a heroine, which she's clearly made into through this film. She's not some kind of grand dame answer to sexual repression. She's the victim of it.This is a book about young men, and men of age, trying to understand their world through the collective totem of the Lisbon sisters. Emphasis on totem. It is not an after school special romanticizing the supposed dreaminess of female adolescence. Ultimately, this isn't a film or book that women should appreciate any more than men or men more than women - it's a human story about men trying to understand women, not women's supposed superiority over male ignorance.Really, thinking on it it's a story of how girls age more quickly than boys. Most boys are awkward and clumsy at 14 (granted, well portrayed in the film) when many girls are quite grown into their adult shapes and can attract men far older than themselves, rendering them dangerous when coupled with the off-limits element. This is a physiological reality that comes into conflict with the values of a society. This reality isn't a male or female reality. It's a human reality, inasmuch as there exists filial and legislative restriction against premarital and youthful intercourse. But in this movie there is none of that nuance.Instead we see a clear, banal, crude sympathy for the suicidal girls. That is a failure, particularly considering the book is written - self-deprecatingly, at times, of course, but still written - by the male characters who, I should mention, don't despise men as much as this movie presents. They admit male foolishness and adore the memory of these young women, but they aren't self-loathing. Neither do they sympathize with the girls. They can't. They don't understand them. So the film shouldn't presume to enter that landscape, which is clearly not laid out by the book. There is room for a film-maker to embellish upon a narrative, but for a Freshman who clearly didn't get the text she was reading, this spells train wreck.We could have been told a story about gender in America and the post-sexual revolution landscape as it related to a decaying Detroit. That would have been nice. Instead of the story the book presents, this film adaptation presents a systematic misandry lacking any nuance or creativity or artistic merit. Better had David Lynch directed this film than Sofia Coppola, who's going to have to do a lot more than put Bill and Scarlett in a room together to convince me she's a real directorial talent and to make up for her performance in the Godfather III, which was the pinnacle of celluloid dross and artistically unforgivable.Last words don't bother.

Sadly the next two acts fall short of the original; though the budget is improved the characters are not as likable as the original's and it seems to have had the power in most of it's kill effects edited away to indulge a 80's-era MPAA (compare the cruelty, violence and gore in this with such 70's fare as The Last House on The Left, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes). Act three however is where Part 2 stands above any of the other movies in the series, mainly due to the characterisation of Jason.Jason Vorhees in Friday the 13th Part 2 is a believable and rounded character, not the slow moving unstoppable Frankenstein's monster like powerhouse that we witness from part 3 onwards. From the moment that our heroine Ginnie (a great performance from Amy Steel) notices that There's someone in this F'ing room!! and Jason lunges towards Paul, we are confronted by an out of control madman who fights, runs and throws himself into his task with an energy unseen in any of the other movies. He is also not unbelievably unstoppable, being floored by a kick to the groin or falling off a chair, this incarnation of Jason Voorhees seems much scarier as he comes across as an out of control animal who is defending his territory rather than the kill for the sake of killing Jason of future movies. The design of Jason's world, from his ramshackle home to the improvised sackcloth mask all add to the grimy and believable world of a psychotic hermit who has lived in seclusion in a forest for years.Fans of the slasher genre should see this worthy follow up to the original and witness the birth of a true pop culture icon before he gets his hockey mask and becomes more machine than man.

Sadly the next two acts fall short of the original; though the budget is improved the characters are not as likable as the original's and it seems to have had the power in most of it's kill effects edited away to indulge a 80's-era MPAA (compare the cruelty, violence and gore in this with such 70's fare as The Last House on The Left, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes). Act three however is where Part 2 stands above any of the other movies in the series, mainly due to the characterisation of Jason.Jason Vorhees in Friday the 13th Part 2 is a believable and rounded character, not the slow moving unstoppable Frankenstein's monster like powerhouse that we witness from part 3 onwards. From the moment that our heroine Ginnie (a great performance from Amy Steel) notices that There's someone in this F'ing room!! and Jason lunges towards Paul, we are confronted by an out of control madman who fights, runs and throws himself into his task with an energy unseen in any of the other movies. He is also not unbelievably unstoppable, being floored by a kick to the groin or falling off a chair, this incarnation of Jason Voorhees seems much scarier as he comes across as an out of control animal who is defending his territory rather than the kill for the sake of killing Jason of future movies. The design of Jason's world, from his ramshackle home to the improvised sackcloth mask all add to the grimy and believable world of a psychotic hermit who has lived in seclusion in a forest for years.Fans of the slasher genre should see this worthy follow up to the original and witness the birth of a true pop culture icon before he gets his hockey mask and becomes more machine than man.
