They want people to love it because it made us think, well the entire time I was thinking when will this movie end. As far as acting, the cast was fine, but to me the plot was not there. There was no character development. We see the main character go through some hard times but he never changes. I am a huge Kurt Russell fan and in this movie, again like all the other actors he did a good job but, the fact that he signed on to do this movie makes me want to vomit.

I would venture those who thought this film was mushy and silly are very young people, and most probably should study it to see how they will be - they hope ! - in their own elder-years. I'm there already, but feel just like Hepburn acts, ageless.....This WAS the most endearing role of Fonda's career - he was an opinionated man in real-life and chose his roles well, to fit his ideals. Perhaps Tenticles was just to pay the rent. Can't understand how some people didn't enjoy his role in The Grapes of Wrath - gripping tale which didn't call for over-the-top acting. This movie was a little cleaned-up for how the depression really was. On Golden Pond reflected the simplicity of his off-screen life - he could be seen almost daily tilling a big vegetable garden next to his home in Beverly Hills, yet. It wasn't one of the snobbish houses - just nice. A bit of trivia some of Hollywoods biggest stars did not live in mansions - Lucille Ball, for instance - not far away from Fonda.I truly am stumped that ANYONE could denigrate Hepburn's career. One user painted her as a hard woman - smart would be better. She could have married Howard Hughes, but knew his life was full of baggage. Her career withstood without scandal the open secret that she was madly in love with Spencer Tracy, who was hard to love. That she won four Oscars should demonstrate she knew which roles to choose and how to bring them to life, not just deliver them. WE ALL could take lessons from her on how to be true to yourself, but also be principled.Jane Fonda was much like her dad, in that she was opinionated and fearless in expressing her opinions. Too much already about all that War stuff !! - take a very good look at They Shoot Horses, Don't They and you'll see this lady is a skillful actress. Maybe it and Klute are too old for today's users ? Doug McKeon gets billing over Dabney Coleman? Hmmmmmm......how did THAT happen ? I don't recall seeing McKeon in one other film - made more? I was in a Mark Rydell film and can attest - as most people recognized - his directing was brilliant, because he did exactly as folk said get the best and let them do their roles. If Ernest Thompson won an Oscar for his screen-adaptation from his Broadway-hit, then that attests he knew his theme and made it better.What a magical cast!, combined with a beautiful score and clear-cut cinematography. Hepburn and Fonda had acting-experience under their belts, and also knew what aging entailed. As one user wrote, younger people should get to know their grandparents better. Fonda's candor and delivery were a perfect match for Hepburn's supportive love - brilliant acting! I found Jane's edginess for her role to be a natural - Billy was the perfect example that her dad wanted a boy, perhaps as rebellious as Billy was.All of this put together into a tale of lives grown goldenly ripe is fail-proof, no matter what film it was up-against. True, there won't be too many more movies from Hollywood like this film, because there aren't any actors\/actresses left to do them - maybe Streep. Pitt and Jolie ? PLEASE ! I completely overlooked the shadow of the 'copter showing the scene goofs pointed-out - unimportant. There weren't any other goofs. Indeed, this film will live for ever, because it preserves on media which can let us watch it over-and-over again - which I do.

And every time I'm proved wrong.Bonnie and Clyde was one of the first American movies to acknowledge that Americans are turned on by violence. People blame this movie for ushering in the increasingly graphic content of movies that in the present day makes it seem as if nothing is off limits. But this is wishful thinking on the part of people who don't want to admit that America has been a violent culture from day one. Bonnie and Clyde was a huge hit, but it's because it gave people what they wanted, not because it introduced them to something they'd never thought of before. At least in this film, you see what happens when a bullet tears through human flesh -- I can't say the same for the countless morale-boosting WWII films from the 1940s or the John Wayne westerns that are so beloved by conservative America.In the world of Bonnie and Clyde, sex and violence are extensions of the same impulse. Clyde can't get one gun to work, so he uses another. Bonnie is as restless as a cat in heat -- but Clyde won't scratch her itch, so she finds other ways of releasing tension. It's a movie that makes us identify with the killers. They're gorgeous and glamorous, but they're also vulnerable. They're Robin Hoods, justifying their crime by stealing from the rich and giving to the poor; but they're also naive in thinking that when they steal money from banks they're not also stealing from the poor rural people who use those banks. Authority figures aren't seen much in the film, but when they are, they're sadistic. Sheriff Hamer is a stony, craggy mass in comparison to the movie-star killers, and C.W. Moss's dad, who's finally the one to turn Bonnie and Clyde in, does what is right morally, but that's overshadowed by the fact that all we see him do is beat C.W. and call him white trash. It's no wonder this half-wit kid ran away with the Barrow gang in the first place. We know there's only one possible ending to the movie, yet by the time it comes, we find ourselves half hoping that Bonnie and Clyde can start over and make the American dream a reality. We've forgotten that they've killed, many times, in cold blood.The most haunting scene in the film is the one in which Bonnie visits her mother for one last time, and her mom tells her what the audience has known all along but hasn't consciously acknowledged until that point You try to live within three miles of me, and you won't live long honey.

It may or may not be as faithful to the Bram Stoker novel of Dracula as the other films in its vein (never read the book), but what Herzog is interested in may not be what is shared by more modern vampire-film fans. This is actually a vampire film that does earn its PG rating; it's not violent at all, and its lack of violence and bloodletting allows for other factors that wouldn't be seen on Buffy the Vampire Slayer or, of course, Blade. It almost tries to be a 'thinking man's' vampire movie, where themes of decimation, the Gothic, and the dreadful are amplified by Herzog and his DP Jörg Schmidt-Reitwein's use of locales and the objects in them. While I have not seen the bulk of Herzog's more famous films, this may be one of his best in just purely visual, creepily atmospheric terms. It combines some elements of early German expressionism, the kind that crawls up your skin and is even more spooky than anything in any modern horror effort (and a small tip of the hat to Murnau's landmark 1922 effort), and at the same time incorporating some documentary-style elements (many hand-held scenes).But the problems of the film, at least from my perspective, almost compete with the film's attributes. Being that this Nosferatu, unlike Murnau's film, is in sound and color and with better resources and locations, and suffers from a few qualities that could have been given better attention by Herzog and his people. The acting, for example, is a mixed bag of goods and not so goods. Kinski, to be sure, is one of the major reasons to see the film, as his Count Dracula carries an extra weight of malaise, terror, and (due to Kinski himself) a further dark tragedy to his very existence. Any moment he was on screen I was hooked into what he, the nutty actor he is, was doing. Bruno Ganz as the other important character, Jonathan Harker, was good as well in what was required of him. But the part of Lucy is played by Isabelle Adjani in a way that brings the film down sometimes. Maybe in part it was due to watching her perform in English instead of the German dub, but aside from her beautiful physical presence, which isn't enough on its own, her emotional and reactionary read-out was pretty bad. And other supporting players who tackle regulars like Renfield and (possibly under-used) Van Helsing only have little moments in lackluster turns.And there's even something almost conflicting with the atmosphere itself that waxed and waned with it working or not. Despite Herzog capturing some effective, strange but very palatable images, chiefly the countless, domineering rats that come about through Nosferatu's very presence, changing an entire city into a feeble and plague-a-plenty place, there's something 'off' sometimes. And it might be more in due to the music, by Popol Vuh, who have also created music for other Herzog films. The themes that are used work the first time around, but they are repeated without the same effect, or of a lesser kind, than before; such a deliberate, near awe-inspiring amount of visuals need the right musical touches, and it's just 50\/50 in what works and what doesn't. In the end, what Herzog, his actors, and crew provides with this take on the vampire legend is definitely not one to dismiss, as it has some chilling qualities and a couple of shocking touches. On its own its never boring even in its slowest moments, and amounts to being a good example of what can be done with the most notorious in the sub-genre. But it goes without saying that it misses the mark of being as daring and audacious as Murnau's silent was.

It may or may not be as faithful to the Bram Stoker novel of Dracula as the other films in its vein (never read the book), but what Herzog is interested in may not be what is shared by more modern vampire-film fans. This is actually a vampire film that does earn its PG rating; it's not violent at all, and its lack of violence and bloodletting allows for other factors that wouldn't be seen on Buffy the Vampire Slayer or, of course, Blade. It almost tries to be a 'thinking man's' vampire movie, where themes of decimation, the Gothic, and the dreadful are amplified by Herzog and his DP Jörg Schmidt-Reitwein's use of locales and the objects in them. While I have not seen the bulk of Herzog's more famous films, this may be one of his best in just purely visual, creepily atmospheric terms. It combines some elements of early German expressionism, the kind that crawls up your skin and is even more spooky than anything in any modern horror effort (and a small tip of the hat to Murnau's landmark 1922 effort), and at the same time incorporating some documentary-style elements (many hand-held scenes).But the problems of the film, at least from my perspective, almost compete with the film's attributes. Being that this Nosferatu, unlike Murnau's film, is in sound and color and with better resources and locations, and suffers from a few qualities that could have been given better attention by Herzog and his people. The acting, for example, is a mixed bag of goods and not so goods. Kinski, to be sure, is one of the major reasons to see the film, as his Count Dracula carries an extra weight of malaise, terror, and (due to Kinski himself) a further dark tragedy to his very existence. Any moment he was on screen I was hooked into what he, the nutty actor he is, was doing. Bruno Ganz as the other important character, Jonathan Harker, was good as well in what was required of him. But the part of Lucy is played by Isabelle Adjani in a way that brings the film down sometimes. Maybe in part it was due to watching her perform in English instead of the German dub, but aside from her beautiful physical presence, which isn't enough on its own, her emotional and reactionary read-out was pretty bad. And other supporting players who tackle regulars like Renfield and (possibly under-used) Van Helsing only have little moments in lackluster turns.And there's even something almost conflicting with the atmosphere itself that waxed and waned with it working or not.

The opening sequence which turned me off at first initially left me questioning those who claimed this work a masterpiece. Is this what everyone talked so highly about??? As the story progressed though, I began to enjoy the story more and could not help but cheer on George Bailey (James Stewart), an everyman who sacrifices his ambitious dreams to help others and subsequently, has a huge impact on his town of Bedford Falls.James Stewart is fantastic as George Bailey! This is his first movie after the war and he felt insecure with his acting abilities, but that definitely doesn't show on screen. Instead, he effectively delivers both sides of Bailey's personality righteous, loving, ambitious, sacrificing and confident as well as bitter, frustrated, with high temperament and vulnerability. These juxtaposed personalities show James Stewarts versatility and raw talent in one of his most beloved roles.Donna Reed, who plays Stewart's Wife Mary Bailey, and Lionel Barrymore, who plays the wicked, monopolizing antagonist Mr. Henry Potter, both deliver fantastic performances as well. Donna Reed and James Stewart's chemistry is believable as seen in one of my favorite scenes-- the telephone scene. I was surprised to find out it took only one take to film such passion and emotion. And Lionel exudes such evil that you cannot help but feel angry towards him.The acting is excellent, the direction by the great Frank Capra amazing, the scenes breathtaking and set magnificent (4 acres of RKO's Encino Ranch!--see trivia). This film just wowed me on all different levels of technicalities.But on top of all of that, this movie made me see my life in a different light. It made me want to help others more than I already do, just the small things even and appreciate the people that I come into contact with everyday of my life, learning that they have had a major or minor impact on me, an impact nonetheless, and I on them. To want to waste or give up on Life is to waste away or give up something so Wonderful.A movie is truly great if it moves the human soul and this one is one of them.

It's a movie directed by Carl Reiner that strips away really any sense of real order so that Steven Martin can do his shtick without looking crazy enough to be put away. The premise, of course, is ridiculous, but it still puts a smile on my face when I think about it- Martin's raised a poor, black child by a family in Mississippi, until one day he 'find's his rhythm' (one of the funniest scenes), and he goes off into the world to find himself. In his time out in the world, St. Louis, he finds love in Bernadette Peters, a job at a gas station (helmed by Jackie Mason), and gets rich through a simple invention. So much of the Jerk is meant as comedy where so much is put out that only some of it can stick. Unlike Reiner's old counterpart Mel Brooks, Reiner isn't able to completely balance out the delirious with equally good sincere moments. But it goes without saying that some of the scenes are very memorable, especially if you're a Martin fan. Images like him finding the rhythm, keeping the dogs over his genitals, suddenly going all Bruce Lee when the 'N' word is dropped, and moments like Mason's explanation of sex, they're classic moments in 70's anything-goes comedy. And another big reason the movie doesn't fall apart sometimes is because of Martin's own willingness to be so idiotic; there's a certain reckless abandon that shows him to be an actor with the gift of throwing himself head-on into the hysteria. There's even an ironically lovable side to the Jerk; where else will you get a dog named s***head? Sometimes a joke will fall flat, but there are many others that don't, at least for most of the audience, and it's definitely a good notch above the recent Martin vehicles.

(Judging from its famously-meager box office take, I was one of only a few dozen who did the same.) In the 20 years since, HOWARD has gone down in Hollywood history as one of the most expensive movie bombs EVER and it is generally looked down upon by serious film fans. I have to ask them WHY? Howard the Duck KICKED ASS in 1986 and it still kicks ass today! It had everything a talking duck for a hero, gigantic Dark Overlords from outer space, crashes, explosions, endless duck puns, remarkably decent special effects (most of which still hold up today), bad '80s synth-rock songs, and Lea Thompson at her most gorgeous in the role of Beverly Switzer, punk rocker and Duck-o-philiac. If it were not for this film I would not have developed my lifelong crush on Miss Thompson (which still persists to this day... if you watch her infamous tender love scene with Howard in which she's wearing only her underwear and you DON'T fall immediately in love with her, there's something seriously wrong with you!), nor would I say Hey, there's Phil Blumburtt! every time I see Tim Robbins in another movie. I'm sure the majority of the cast and crew involved with HOWARD would like to forget that the movie ever happened, but judging from the comments on this board, there are untold legions of bad-'80s-movie devotees out there like me who loved this movie then, still love it now, and are dying to own HOWARD THE DUCK on DVD. It absolutely astounds me, that with the amount of CRAP out there filling video store shelves, HOWARD has never achieved a DVD release. It's been 20 years, where's our 2-Disc 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition, Mister Lucas? I'm still getting by with my taped copy of HOWARD that I recorded off of HBO back in the '80s, and it's about due for a replacement! Seriously folks, don't believe the hype. HOWARD THE DUCK is worth seeing, and it's nowhere near as bad as you've heard. Trust me. MetalGeek has never lied to you before.

It had everything a talking duck for a hero, gigantic Dark Overlords from outer space, crashes, explosions, endless duck puns, remarkably decent special effects (most of which still hold up today), bad '80s synth-rock songs, and Lea Thompson at her most gorgeous in the role of Beverly Switzer, punk rocker and Duck-o-philiac. If it were not for this film I would not have developed my lifelong crush on Miss Thompson (which still persists to this day... if you watch her infamous tender love scene with Howard in which she's wearing only her underwear and you DON'T fall immediately in love with her, there's something seriously wrong with you!), nor would I say Hey, there's Phil Blumburtt! every time I see Tim Robbins in another movie. I'm sure the majority of the cast and crew involved with HOWARD would like to forget that the movie ever happened, but judging from the comments on this board, there are untold legions of bad-'80s-movie devotees out there like me who loved this movie then, still love it now, and are dying to own HOWARD THE DUCK on DVD. It absolutely astounds me, that with the amount of CRAP out there filling video store shelves, HOWARD has never achieved a DVD release. It's been 20 years, where's our 2-Disc 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition, Mister Lucas? I'm still getting by with my taped copy of HOWARD that I recorded off of HBO back in the '80s, and it's about due for a replacement! Seriously folks, don't believe the hype. HOWARD THE DUCK is worth seeing, and it's nowhere near as bad as you've heard. Trust me. MetalGeek has never lied to you before.

Some people ridicule the costumes and accents, but what's important is the spirit of the film. I sincerely doubt anyone made the same kind of comments back in 1960. It was a seminal film and must have inspired a generation of film makers. You don't need CGI to make a good film. It's all about the story and the ingenuity of having to make do with the things you've got to hand. This film exemplifies that attitude.I first saw The Time Machine as a 10 year old in 1970 and was utterly captivated. The stop-motion photography was spell-binding to me; particularly when George kills one of the attacking Morlocks. The gory footage of the body decomposing will abide with me forever. More importantly, and for the first time in my life, I was completely swept away with the concept of time travel. This film was unlike anything I had ever seen before and sowed seeds of profound thought for many years after.This film may not be for everyone, but it was for a certain 10 year-old boy all those years ago.
