Hawn and Martin's reactions alone make every chase, mugging, snubbing, and arrest worth it. As a laughable Ohioan myself, I can see why the main characters remain ever uncomfortable and ever out-of-place, which makes every joke where New York is the brunt doubly funny. This film also sends a useful message in the end. It teaches people not to give up, turn around, and head for home because of people that don't want you, but to beat them at their own game.Only in New York. . . no, not really, but let them think that if it means winning in the end.
