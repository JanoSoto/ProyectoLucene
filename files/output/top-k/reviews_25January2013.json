I wanted to start with Sweet and Lowdown (because that's my favorite Gershwin piece and it sounded kind of awesome), which seems to be one of his lesser-known movies, but it wasn't on instant Netflix so I turned to Manhattan. It's set to a strictly Gershwin soundtrack, it's a post-Technicolor black and white film, and it reunites Woody Allen and Diane Keaton- what more could I ask for? As it turns out, a lot. Watching this film was very much, for me, like visiting New York City for the first time. I had heard about New York from Frank Sinatra, seen it in Breakfast at Tiffany's, walked its streets with Holden Caulfield, but when I stepped foot in Manhattan for the first time, I wasn't in Manhattan at all. I was in a dingy city lit up by too many wasted watts of electricity, a city with too many McDonalds and not enough trees. A woman actually blew cigarette smoke in my face and everything! I wasn't in New York City at all, because New York City doesn't really exist, except for in Woody Allen movies and those sorts of things. And so it goes with Manhattan. Here it was, inarguably Allen's magnum opus, his love letter to dear New York City, a guest at the Oscars- but it wasn't. I was hoping for the witty writing, the stand-up comedian sort of humor I had come to expect after watching Annie Hall, but it all seemed very old hat to me, like a watered-down version of Woody Allen movie. I don't mean to sound awful, but I can't help but wonder if he wrote the script just so he could film romantic scenes with someone twenty years younger than himself. And God was it pretentious. It was so pretentious. I'm all for allusions to art or literature or what have you (your self-confidence is a notch below Kafka's- that line- sorry if it isn't verbatim- did make me laugh), but nobody in real life goes on about van Gogh (gah?) and all the way Keaton's character did.

Ron Rifkin has a showy role as Ribisi's father.It's interesting that several compared this film to Wall Street and Glengarry Glen Ross - certainly the comparisons are valid - but someone mentioned a real-life comparison, to the Enron situation. The documentary I saw was Enron The Smartest Guys in the Room and I think that's an apt comparison as well.The plot concerns a young man, Seth Davis, who makes money running a backroom casino. His father is a federal judge and the two men are distanced from one another, his father making it clear that he doesn't approve.One night, a man comes into the casino and suggests a stockbroker job for Seth with a boutique company. Seth becomes a trainee there, and comes up against heavy competition and ruthless bosses and managers, one of whom is played by Ben Affleck and another played by Nicky Katt. He temporarily wins his father's approval as he learns how to always be closing with every phone call, and the art of the deal. There's just one problem - there's something a little odd about the place, and Seth can't put his finger on it. What he doesn't realize is that the business is under investigation, and the Feds have targeted someone close to Seth for information.Interesting film and very well acted. What's scary is, this type of thing worked with Enron so I wouldn't say it's unrealistic. Greed is greed, be it in stockbrokers, corporations, or stock owners.I felt like others, let down by the ending. I could have used another five minutes to wrap it up better.SPOILER HERE STOP IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE ***Did anyone else think Seth's father set him up?

I found it hard to believe that as a Federal judge he would go along with this IPO and say, on the phone, that he wanted to help Seth so he wouldn't get caught - and this is all recorded and played back to him when Seth is brought in. The Feds banked on Seth spilling his guts in order to save his father. One would think his father would believe it would go the other way and therefore wouldn't have agreed to it, but he must have seen how desperate this kid was for his love and gone along with the Feds.

I had seen it myself on a couple of occasions before, most probably on the same channel and always quite liked it.

However, once we get used to them and their strange, odd ways, they become part of our screen lives and as if they were people we actually know, we put up with their annoying aspects and revel in their good, Leigh's folk are very human, almost TOO much so.So, Leigh's purpose was to show how passages of time, circumstance and education, plus friendship can follow in both predictive and unpredicted ways with the reunion of two Uni classmates ten years later, with frequent, but obvious, flashbacks to the student years, we can see how people can change. Side by side, the contrasts are very marked, almost too much so, but as we usually witness our friends forming slowly, year by year, who's to say that Leigh is not right?There's a smaller pool of main characters than with the better Leighs, and as with say, the later but even less good Happy Go Lucky, there is less respite from the obnoxious and smaller variety in which to spice up the story.Oddly, considering it's the female lead characters that Leigh is championing it's the two male leads that we see regularly on TV and cinema screen these days - Mark Benton as the twitchy, overweight Goth who gets to know them in student digs but always finds solace and comfort in food instead of confronting fears, including women; these two women. And Andy Serkis, who Leigh says he made as an opposite to Benton's sweet nature as possible and in Serkis, we have a 'disgusting pig' as Leigh refers to him. Both chauvinist and arrogant he could be seen as the ultimate product of the Thatcherite Yuppie years and again, typically Leigh, he doesn't portray this subtly and quite rightly, we want to leave his company as quickly as possible but perhaps more importantly, want our 'girls' to, as well. There are lots of comedic takes on Serkis' lifestyle 'choices' and this does lighten the emotional load.The two female leads, Katrin Cartlidge and Lynda Steadman though do not seem to be gracing our screens at all right now, though Cartlidge did feature in Leigh's Topsy Turvy (1999) and previously in the excellent Naked(Leigh's best film, probably) from 1993. Steadman seemed to have been in TV dramas about then but - all according to IMDb - nothing since 2003.Maybe Mike Leigh has made too much out of political and economic markers to make us really care for any of the people here.

But Pretty Woman, a feature film about a prostitute who turns into a princess after meeting a Californian prince, is no more sleazy than Disney's animated films aimed at children. The message, values and narrative arcs are all the same.The plot? Richard Gere plays a millionaire who's depressed because his father doesn't love him. Disillusioned, he prepares to dismantle and downsize his giant corporate empire. Luckily he meets a hooker played by Julia Roberts. He showers her in money, riches and fine clothes, she teaches him to be a kind, good businessman who provides jobs to shipbuilders. She rescues him from depression and bad capitalism, he rescues her from the slums, prostitution and, ergo, bad capitalism. The couple no longer screw people over, be it as prostitutes or as corporate raiders, but engage in moral transactions. They get married, live happily ever after and he builds warships.Like Indecent Proposal, released around the same time, the super-wealthy are initially malevolent but reveal themselves to be caring and decent. Prostitution is good, clean, profitable, fun and just another career choice. Women, as prostitutes, make their own decisions and are entirely independent, strong and in control of their bodies and choices. Softcore titillation is used, and the prevailing aesthetic is one which bows down to wealth, riches, materialism and money. The end goal is always monogamous marital bliss, women gladly debase themselves to be with their wealthy providers and love conquers all difficulties and is constant. Furthermore, super-rich princes are the male ideal and hookers with hearts of gold are the female ideal. Prostitution has no serious consequences, prostitution is glorified and takes place between free women and sensitive guys, and monogamous marriage, capitalism, patriarchy, and commodification are all endorsed. Elsewhere expensive finery masks amorality, men mould women into their own little dolls, corruption is unimportant (because everyone is corrupt, everyone's a whore, and so corruption is relative), corporate raiders care about people other than themselves (members from the urban poor, no less) and disparages in wealth, taste, experience and education are both cute and don't thwart romance. Compare this to Francois Truffaut's The Soft Skin, where the provincial mannerisms of a similar woman are mocked by her aristocratic lover.To make the film work, Big Business must be glorified as much as prostitution. Gere's a Prince Charming, climbing towers to rescue his lady. Oddly, the film is adored by women. It very much represents a post-feminist stance; as all female desire is celebrated, the fantasy of winning a rich prince is super cool, even if this first means that a woman must first unconsciously self-identify as a whore. Servitute is embraced because the self is redefined as feminine-consumer, allowed to window-shop for any and all desires, which in this case is implicitly connected to women's magazines, the fashion industry and the disciplined use of makeup, clothing, exercise etc. Everyone can be transformed from working girl to lady of leisure, everyone is allowed to dream of being valuable and feel valued, everyone is trained in the art of seduction, self-marketing, sexual gratification and consumer display.4\/10 - My Fair Lady meets Cinderella meets Pygmalion.

In fact, it is one of those movies that even though you know what is coming up, the scene itself is still very amusing.I am sure everybody in Australia knows who Uncle Chop Chop, or Mark 'Chopper' Brandon Reid is, but for those international people who don't believe that there is anything of relevance outside of their borders, he was basically a Melbourne standoverman who pretty much made a packet (legitimately) by writing a series of books while he was in prison. As he says in the movie, he is a best selling author, and he can't spell, so there are probably a bunch of university graduated English majors who are fuming. My thoughts are more power to him, particularly since what he writes about (and shame on me for not actually having read any of his books) are things that people actually want to read.The question really is whether the events in this movie are true or not. Well, to be honest with you, as Chopper says himself, the movie is 100% true and 100% rubbish. The one thing that crims, especially those like Chopper Read, is to take a true story and embellish it so much that nobody can actually use the story itself to prove that what actually happened is true or false. Mind you, most of the scenes in Pentridge (with maybe the exception of the stabbing murder of one of the Painters and Dockers leader) are probably true, namely because there are corroborative sources, but then most of those scenes do not implicate him in anything anyway. Still, the murder probably did happen as described, but then again we will never know.However, there are parts of this film that are not true to form. Granted, Bana plays his role brilliantly, right down to the fact that you can actually believe that he is some paranoid, drug crazed, standoverman, however Chopper actually took offence at the suggestion that he actually beat up women. To be honest, there are aspects of the criminal world that would not stand for that type of behaviour. They say that there is no honour among thieves, but that saying is actually as flawed as some of the stories in this film.As is suggested, Chopper never went after or assaulted an innocent person, and this is very much the case among the professional underworld.

The professionals actually don't care about these people, namely because there are more important fish to fry when dealing with the underbelly of society. Mind you, while the criminal underworld intrudes into every aspect of our lives (you can be assured that the local pub is probably paying protection money to somebody) those of us who are not involved in it, probably don't need to worry about having some professional killer come gunning after you.

Mind you, most of the scenes in Pentridge (with maybe the exception of the stabbing murder of one of the Painters and Dockers leader) are probably true, namely because there are corroborative sources, but then most of those scenes do not implicate him in anything anyway. Still, the murder probably did happen as described, but then again we will never know.However, there are parts of this film that are not true to form. Granted, Bana plays his role brilliantly, right down to the fact that you can actually believe that he is some paranoid, drug crazed, standoverman, however Chopper actually took offence at the suggestion that he actually beat up women. To be honest, there are aspects of the criminal world that would not stand for that type of behaviour. They say that there is no honour among thieves, but that saying is actually as flawed as some of the stories in this film.As is suggested, Chopper never went after or assaulted an innocent person, and this is very much the case among the professional underworld. They are not interested in innocent people. Those who commit muggings and break and enters of random houses then to be young street kids, those that the professional underworld considers expendable. The professionals actually don't care about these people, namely because there are more important fish to fry when dealing with the underbelly of society. Mind you, while the criminal underworld intrudes into every aspect of our lives (you can be assured that the local pub is probably paying protection money to somebody) those of us who are not involved in it, probably don't need to worry about having some professional killer come gunning after you.

The question at the end though, are they too late, and can our hero ever sleep again lest he be absorbed into the collective conscience of the pod people.The movie opens with a man in a hospital talking about aliens who take the shape of people and slowly replace them. The doctors are very sceptical but he tells the story of how he returns to his home town of Santa Mira to find some strange things going on. At first people want to have an appointment with him (as he is a doctor) and then later they cancel it. Others come to him and tell him how people are just not quite right but there is no real evidence that they have been replaced. In fact they have been replaced by pod people. They have no emotion and simply live life and do things but get no enjoyment out of it.Thus this film has two possibilities it is anti-capitalist, or it is anti-communist. This film is made in 1956, three years after the last HUAC hearing in Hollywood, but it is still considered to fall into the sphere of the communist film. Invasion of the Body Snatchers attacks conformity. This is a very individualist film and that the individual is more important than social unity. As such this would fall into the anti-communist theme. The pod people replace people and it is impossible to tell them apart from the real person except for maybe a gut feeling. There is no process from when they start, except that it comes out of the farms. The pods are grown by farmers who use them to dominate the town. This is probably a subtle warning that it will be from the farm that the problems arise. The farmers are generally struggling and discontent and thus it will be from their farms that a possible communist uprising could begin. Even so, there are numerous other underclasses in the United States, such as the labourers, women, Negroes, and generally any other non-white, non-European person.There is also the anti-capitalist approach to the movie. This movie shows conformity, peer pressure, and the destruction of self and emotion. The anti-capitalist side seems to be more subtle than the anti-communist side for the main character is fighting for individual freedom. The difference is that the change is unnoticeable. Unlike other more anti-communist movies such as Invaders from Mars, and It Conquered the World, the elements in this movie show life as normal with the exception that all emotion is slowly stripped away. Thus this movie could be seen as an anti-capitalist movie disguised as an anti-communist movie.It is the peer pressure and the conformity of the United States that is attacked. How we go to work everyday and do the same things and then one day, when we awake, we have lost our identity, we no longer have any identity. The whole issue around here deals with sleep and how the more we come to accept what is happening, the more we conform to society. This movie seems to try to wake us up and take notice on how the society is becoming much more conformist that all individual will is being pushed out.The peer pressure shown in the film is a similar idea that undermines the capitalist system. Everybody is subject to pressure to conform to social norms, and this pressure takes away the free, individual spirit. This is not a movie where the important people are working to undermine the freedom of the United States, but one where everybody is putting pressure, including his loved one, onto the main character to accept the conversion and not to resist. Invasion of the Body Snatchers does not force us to prepare for a communist invasion, but rather warns us that to continue to move in the same direction, we will lose our identity and become what we hate the most.

Film director Joel McCrea is disgusted by what he sees as a curable disease of mankind and society and decides to head out disguised as a hobo (stalked by his butler and valet) to find out their real issues and plan a new epic to document their struggles in a world of denial. Along the way, he meets a beautiful but broke movie extra (Veronica Lake) on the verge of leaving Hollywood. She buys him ham and eggs (fooled by his disguise) then is disgusted when she discovers the truth. On his own, McCrea fights off lonely widows, finds some sympathy but ultimately ends up in a work camp, a victim of amnesia who assaults a train officer in self-defense. The camp's sadistic guard cruelly taunts him and all seems lost until the amnesiac McCrea sees the other inmates laughing at a Mickey Mouse cartoon and realizes what people needs is laughter rather than a reminder of things that they already know.Although the plot is wrapped up rather quickly and a bit too neatly, it is still a satisfying conclusion. Writer and Director Preston Sturges acknowledges the Capra like structure of the plot, and like Capra, utilizes a strong core of character actors, most notably Eric Blore as the valet, Robert Greig as the butler, Esther Howard as the love-starved widow, Almira Sessions as the prickly housekeeper and Jimmy Conlin as the kindly trustee at the work farm.

This is an oft-overlooked classic where the songs (by Frank Loesser) are better known than the movie Wonderful, Wonderful Copenhagen, Inchworm, Ugly Duckling and Thumbelina.Presented as a fairy tale, it bears no resemblance to a biography of Hans Christian Andersen, and says so right at the beginning. Hans is a cobbler in an obscure Danish village and wants nothing more out of life that the right to enjoy it and tell stories to the children. The schoolmaster wants Hans to leave town because he disrupts the school. He is persuaded by his apprentice to visit Copenhagen. So he does. He falls in love with a beautiful ballerina there.(Jeanmarie) He fantasizes marrying her and writes the story of The Little Mermaid, which becomes a successful ballet with her in the starring role. He makes special ballet slippers for the ballerina to wear. He returns home, after realizing that she is very happily married, where he is now a celebrated author, loved and respected by all the townspeople.The Emperor's New Clothes (The King is in the All-Together) is sung to the children, as are all the stories he tells. No animation here, although Walt Disney's Studios were considered. They are all well-acted out by Danny Kaye, especially Thumbelina, with a thumb puppet and a handkerchief. All of his stories have a moral and enrich the lives of the children that hear them.The ballet scenes are a real stand-out, but they might be a little slow for some, and were often shortened for TV viewing. Good special effects, and flying on wire to simulate mermaid swimming. Not exactly the Wizard of Oz, but very well-filmed in brilliant Technicolor, with beautiful sets and costumes.Some of the reviewers obviously do not appreciate this movie, making comments about the ballet and the film's dialog. I suppose they think that maybe Danny Kaye was gay just because he sang and danced? He was married and had one child, a daughter, Dora.Danny Kaye gives a somewhat subdued performance here and, as noted before, this film is often overlooked. I believe it is one of his best.

These are then put into a sequence of situations that resolve themselves into a satisfactory conclusion. Of course we are taken on quite a journey before this conclusion and I can see how some may find the plot a little hard to follow. Fortunately I have read the Shakespeare play and even seen it performed and so am familiar with all its twists and turns. I love the way it's written with allusions to the original text, for instance calling the school 'Padua' was a very nice touch. All the performances were excellent with both Heath Ledger as Patrick Verona and Julia Stiles as Kat Stratford taking the plaudits. I must also give a nod to; Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Cameron James, Larisa Oleynik as Bianca Stratford, David Krumholtz as Michael and Andrew Keegan as Joey Donner. Oh, and look out for a nice comic turn from Allison Janney as Ms. Perky; very funny.It may not be everyone's cup of tea but I really enjoyed this film and have every time I've seen it! I know it got few plaudits from the critics when it came out, but it certainly speaks to me. It's surprising just how many people 'love that movie' when I bring it up; but so few can tell me what it's about. Definitely worth a watch if you've never seen it and if you have, give it another look sometime; it's well worthy of a second look. Watch right to the end of the credits as well for some amusing outtakes.SteelMonster's verdict HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDMy score 8.5\/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog Thoughts of a SteelMonster.

But why? and why isn't it considered to be Kubrick enough to be better known as one of his and indeed, as my title suggests, a quick check through the best- selling Kubrick box-sets, none includes Spartacus.Firstly, Anthony Mann was the original director and started off with the project, he's still accredited as co-director in some listings. His set- pieces include the early scenes set in Libyan desert. Star and executive producer Kirk Douglas fired Mann and enrolled Kubrick, from then on. It has been said that Kubrick since disowned the film as he considered himself a hired hand, finishing off someone else's project.Kirk Douglas, does actually have too much control over this movie, to me, the elongated speeches and lingering slushy romance with (admittedly with the very attractive) Jean Simmons bloat both the film's already long length and but also Douglas' ego, a bit. Having said that, like in his role in the excellent The Vikings, he is perfect for the role, physically - like Charlton Heston in Ben Hur, he towers above everybody and everything and takes the film by the scruff of the neck and drags us all the way through.There's more than a whiff of Gladiator in this - more ponderous and talky but the action really does shine - instead of some over-pampered American superstar getting stunt doubles Douglas really does seem to relish the hand-on-hand combats that epitomises what we conceive today as being the Romans at their best - and worst - the Gladiatorial fight to the death, in the ring.For many my age, it's the seeing the greats such as Laurence Olivier, Tony Curtis (as a willowy magician) Peter Ustinov, whose part is almost perfectly replicated by the late (great) Oliver Reed aforementioned Gladiator, that of a slave dealer, who first sees the potential of Spartacus, the slave and how he can fight to save himself from his inevitable plight. But mainly, for Charles Laughton, with his chubby cheeks and curly locks - look at any Roman coin or actual Roman artifact and we have the epitome of the well-fed, pleasure-seeking Roman aristocrat.A rousing musical score by Alex North sounds great in the stereo we now enjoy but obviously did not get when seeing this on our parent's TV. The battle-scenes toward the end are exciting and well choreographed, long before CGI trickery, of course. The rolling flames down the hill are particularly effective and whilst being PG certificate, it is often really quite violent - not for small children, this.So, a lot better than many of the Roman epics that Hollywood churned out but not necessarily one for Kubrick fans wanting actual Kubrick. Yes, he did his job supremely well and no-one could have asked more from him, but William Wyler (who directed Ben Hur) could have done it equally well.

When the women stop to admire the view over the canyon, do they experience that moment of glory to which many of a certain belief aspire? Their faces, their embrace, tell us that.
