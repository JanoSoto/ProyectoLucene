Maybe it's because showing greater appreciation for such films can be seen as an admission of something dark inside us. But these movies don't endorse the violence within; they merely make us see new perspectives and realize there's good and evil within every person.Coming out in 1960, just a bit before Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, Michael Powell's Peeping Tom is also about a mad serial killer. This one is named Mark, who films his women victims before stabbing them with a pointed piece of his camera. This movie has a style reminiscent of Hitchcock's photography, but I actually prefer it to Psycho. Without the stunt of killing off the main character half way through the movie, Peeping Tom gives the viewer more chance to know the killer- and feel more empathy for him. In that way, Peeping Tom is the more extreme movie. Mark was made a monster by years of childhood abuse. Take that away and he could be you or me. I particularly felt connected to him because he was a camera enthusiast, and I've taken a couple photo courses and have a camera myself. This movie also gives the killer a girlfriend, a good woman who doesn't know Mark's horrible secret.If what I've heard is true, this movie was bashed upon its release as hateful. The victims are all women (unless you count Mark as one of his own victims, since he kills himself). But I wouldn't say this movie hates women; I felt sorry for them when they died, and this movie also has two strong heroines, Mark's girlfriend and her blind mother. From Mark's filming to the old Briton nervously buying pornography, Peeping Tom is a naked look at our true society, a pessimistic vision of voyeurism and violence.

They discover a crashed flying saucer, and its extraterrestrial pilot that had been encased in a block of ice. When the ice is accidentally allowed to melt, chaos ensues.The characters are what you might expect The heroic military officer devoted to his career, his orders, and his secretary.

The relationship between the officer and the secretary is full of entertaining and witty remarks, and is especially racy for the time. Listen closely and you will catch numerous innuendos rarely found during those repressed and censored times, as well as a tame yet clear bondage scene in which she ties the officer to a chair while she feeds him his coffee.What makes this much more then the cheesy, dated, melodramatic sci-fi movie you are no doubt imagining is that the film's makers are smart enough to know two things 1. Special effects aren't as well developed in the '50's as they will be later on, and 2. Watching people get chased around an ice station by an alien for an hour and a half is almost always boring. With these points in mind, they never really showed the man-eating alien for more then a second or two until the finale, thus making the whole scenario much more mysterious and engaging. They also bring in an interesting conflict between the military members of the team and the head scientist as to how out civilization should deal with new, scary things. As can be expected the military wants to blow it up, and the scientists want to study it. This step from our reptilian instincts to the sort of intellectual thinking that separates us from other animals is well explored as are the consequences of each option. I won't ruin the ending for you, except to say that it is well done.The remake takes us to the year 1982, but not much of the plot is intact except the frozen location and the presence of an alien. Director John Carpenter gives us some great shots of the icy plains and glaciers that are really breathtaking, and the cast of characters is much more eccentric, although often inebriated. The beginning is strong, as the members of the crew are introduced and some mysterious occurrences cause them to go out and discover the crashed space ship. Surprisingly, it is the first half hour of the movie that's the best, and it goes down hill after the alien is introduced. Carpenter apparently wasn't aware of the points listed earlier, and while he did have some incredible special effects regarding the shape-shifting alien, he neglected to see that even Kurt Russell with a flame thrower can't carry a movie. Rather then building from the enticing beginning and leaving us wanting more, The Thing gave us the more and then some.Had they stuck closer to the original's plot and didn't change the nature of the alien, I'm sure they remake would have been much more successful. While they did a pretty good job the first time, having the added special effects and color film would have pushed the film way up in the ratings. In other words, in 1951 they were held back with in visuals, in 1982 they were held back in the plot. Had they put the two together, The Thing would have been much, much better.

The original was made in 1951, and tells the tale of a group of soldiers and scientists who fly up to the North Pole to investigate a disturbance that had been detected. They discover a crashed flying saucer, and its extraterrestrial pilot that had been encased in a block of ice. When the ice is accidentally allowed to melt, chaos ensues.The characters are what you might expect The heroic military officer devoted to his career, his orders, and his secretary. The top scientist with every decoration imaginable who sees everything as an experiment, and the rest of the team including an eager reporter who delivers a wonderful though slightly clichéd radio broadcast at the film's close. The relationship between the officer and the secretary is full of entertaining and witty remarks, and is especially racy for the time. Listen closely and you will catch numerous innuendos rarely found during those repressed and censored times, as well as a tame yet clear bondage scene in which she ties the officer to a chair while she feeds him his coffee.What makes this much more then the cheesy, dated, melodramatic sci-fi movie you are no doubt imagining is that the film's makers are smart enough to know two things 1. Special effects aren't as well developed in the '50's as they will be later on, and 2. Watching people get chased around an ice station by an alien for an hour and a half is almost always boring. With these points in mind, they never really showed the man-eating alien for more then a second or two until the finale, thus making the whole scenario much more mysterious and engaging. They also bring in an interesting conflict between the military members of the team and the head scientist as to how out civilization should deal with new, scary things. As can be expected the military wants to blow it up, and the scientists want to study it. This step from our reptilian instincts to the sort of intellectual thinking that separates us from other animals is well explored as are the consequences of each option. I won't ruin the ending for you, except to say that it is well done.The remake takes us to the year 1982, but not much of the plot is intact except the frozen location and the presence of an alien. Director John Carpenter gives us some great shots of the icy plains and glaciers that are really breathtaking, and the cast of characters is much more eccentric, although often inebriated.

Eighteen months later a space craft on its way towards Jupiter where it is believed the monolith has come from, with a self contained computer system named HAL-9000, carrying hibernating humans and a crew takes on a mind of its own and turns on the crew. The crew commander, Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea), decides to disconnect HAL.Then a prerecorded message appears on a monitor and it is Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester) explaining the purpose of the mission. Dave finds out from this video that 18 months ago the first evidence of intelligent life off the Earth was discovered. It was buried 40 feet deep below the moons surface and except for a very powerful radio emission aimed at Jupiter, the four-million-year-old black monolith has remained completely inert. Its origin and purpose are still a total mystery. This is where the movie gets more intense. You then find Dave floating through a worm hole and then suddenly appears looking at himself in a bedroom and watches himself get older, the monolith appears, and then Dave suddenly turns into a fetus and then hovering in space looking at Earth.This film stokes the coals of evolution with theory that evolution has been moved along by a black monolith. If you look at the detail given to all of the scenes and the way the angles and lighting are used I can see how this would have been a revolutionary film when it was released in 1968. Even by today's standards I feel that the scenes in space were very realistic and I was impressed by them.The lighting was a constant factor in the film, of course because it was in space.

But one film tackled this subject with some special ingredients to create a stronger impact on people's minds. I'm not sure anyone who participated to Fatal Attraction anticipated the public's reaction, but they surely knew that beyond the thrills, something in Adrian Lyme's film would keep people attracted to it.The key is the identification with the main characters, starting with Dan Gallagher, played by Michael Douglas. I shouldn't even say 'played' because the point of the part is not for the actor to dilute himself behind the character, but just 'to be natural', and create this everyman's feeling. Michael Douglas was the perfect choice because never all-through the film, do we see the movie star, but simply a man with a happy Family, a beautiful wife and a cute little girl, a man with a regular job, not too rich, not too poor, a man who'll be attracted to a single-worker, Alex Forrest, played by Glenn Close, in a career-defining role. Glenn Close proved her immense versatility by playing a woman, not sensual, but sexual. And this is an important aspect, because we must understand why Dan, who had everything to be happy, succumbed to the temptation. Alex Forrest exuded that temptation, there's something in the way she dresses, she makes up, that make her absolutely appealing. And the sex scene is not gratuitous as its intensity serves the purpose of the film, the passion on that kitchen sink is proportional to the ephemeral aspect of the relation, and seems so genuine and improvised, that we laugh as the sight of Dan unable to carry Alex to the bed, with his pants in legs.About Alex Forrest, we all know she's one of the most hated villains or female characters ever. But I think people are overreacting, she's no better, nor worse than other psychotic women like Evelyn Draper or Annie Wilkes. But I try, even as a man, to understand Alex Forrest. The way Glenn Close portrayed her, was like a tormented, not demented (yet) person, she's probably been abused in the past, or lived an experience that lowered her self-esteem, even though she tries to hide it during social occasions. The costume designer of the film did a great job in making Alex so immediately desirable. Alex literally gives herself to Dan as she genuinely loves him, and the way Dan handles this aftermath will cement the feeling of rejection, incarnated by the classic line I'm not gonna be ignored, Dan. There is an emphasis in the word 'ignored' which illustrates the sensitive nerve touched in Alex's heart, she's not a woman to get and to throw, and Dan should have handled things more tactfully.Basically, there are two pivotal points in Alex's evolution into a villain  the bunny scene and the ending. Before the bunny scene, there was still something sympathetic in Alex's portrayal, thanks to Glenn Close's powerful performance. Take the scene where the Gallaghers are having a party and Alex is alone turning on and off the lights, never had the rejection and loneliness been so palpable, it was like the last shot of a woman about to kill herself, and maybe whatever she did after was the only way to pull herself together. Another aspect is Anne Archer's great supporting performance, as she embodies the total decency of Beth, a woman who's a good wife, a good mother, which contrasts with Dan's immoral behavior, and the harassment he endures from Alex seems like a kind of Justice, but after the bunny episode that set the audience off psychologically, Dan reveals his affair and Beth is not a victim anymore, threatening to kill Alex if she ever approaches her family again. As it's impossible not to root for Beth, and since its Dan's first step to redemption, Alex becomes the villain.The original ending had Alex killing herself à la Mrs. Butterfly with the knife Dan held in the previous fight scene, accusing him of homicide. Although that ending echoes some scenes before, I can understand why it didn't appeal to the viewers as it was impossible to perceive Alex like a victim after the bunny scene, and Beth's needed to get off her passive role, and become the housewife who protects her family. I understand the classic ending flirts with some archetypal thriller's situations, like Alex becoming a kind of one-dimensional knife-holding villain, or the classic last jump from the bathroom, yes, the climax is not without some flaws, but overall it makes the movie probably more accessible, the thriller even more efficient because Dan's redemption relied on the difficulty to get rid of Alex  it needed a fight scene, blood and pain. And the ending suggests of course that Dan can go back to his family, he's redeemed. And now, the viewers can ask themselves What if? The social commentary is the strength of the film, in the sense that it constantly questions what we would have done if we were in Dan's shoes? The movie is eye-opening on that level, and creates for infidelity, the same unsettling feeling of fear and apprehension than Jaws for swimming, a feeling foreshadowed at two moments before the affair started, where sex is mentioned as an act not without consequences. And to those who still cheat on their wives, they'll probably have the common courtesy not to abandon the girls they just slept with, whether they are the mistresses or simply one-stand nights, in order not to endure not even one tenth of Dan's nightmare. Maybe Alex would appear less as a villain in our days where loneliness and mental troubles are more banal, but Fatal Attraction doesn't feature villains or heroes, but mostly people victims of unpredictable, sometimes 'fatal' circumstances, as it happens in real life &#x85; ","genre":null},{"date":"24 July 2011","score":"","review":" A married man cheating on his wife, isn't that one of the most unoriginal plot premises ever?

I understand the classic ending flirts with some archetypal thriller's situations, like Alex becoming a kind of one-dimensional knife-holding villain, or the classic last jump from the bathroom, yes, the climax is not without some flaws, but overall it makes the movie probably more accessible, the thriller even more efficient because Dan's redemption relied on the difficulty to get rid of Alex  it needed a fight scene, blood and pain. And the ending suggests of course that Dan can go back to his family, he's redeemed. And now, the viewers can ask themselves What if? The social commentary is the strength of the film, in the sense that it constantly questions what we would have done if we were in Dan's shoes? The movie is eye-opening on that level, and creates for infidelity, the same unsettling feeling of fear and apprehension than Jaws for swimming, a feeling foreshadowed at two moments before the affair started, where sex is mentioned as an act not without consequences. And to those who still cheat on their wives, they'll probably have the common courtesy not to abandon the girls they just slept with, whether they are the mistresses or simply one-stand nights, in order not to endure not even one tenth of Dan's nightmare. Maybe Alex would appear less as a villain in our days where loneliness and mental troubles are more banal, but Fatal Attraction doesn't feature villains or heroes, but mostly people victims of unpredictable, sometimes 'fatal' circumstances, as it happens in real life &#x85; ","genre":"Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"24 July 2011","score":"","review":" This is a fantastic movie. it's not flawless, but it's a great follow-up to the first.

The story is really good- the uber-rich planners and the dirt-poor workers and the city leader's son who seeks to end the tyranny. The film is gripping, and even moving. The film's message resonates with viewers of all ages, and it's prophetic view of the potential of unchecked future societies is one we must all be aware of. Especially when you consider that Adolf Hitler used this film as inspiration for his horrific attempt at a global dictatorship and racial sterilization. The effects are ahead of their time. No one got more out of what was available to him than Lang in this film. I can not imagine how anyone enjoyed this film in any of it's previous versions. It is a timeless classic that will continue to be relevant for decades to come. Any future remake will be spectacular visually, but it will look typical for our time. Simply magnificent.

After the night set, pounding bleakness of something like Naked, Career Girls is the morning after &#x96; a desire for everything to remain quiet and somewhat subdued; a film with people, more often than not, inhabiting cleaner, more cleansed locales and speaking on more grounded, humanised terms as they remember the past and laugh at things from times gone by instead of look ahead to a future of the impending disasters that are readily incoming.In some regards, the film is about the addressing of one's past; the acknowledging of what it is that made oneself in terms of one's experiences and being unafraid to confront them or indeed revisit a proverbial place in which one felt one's identity was forged. For the most part, the two female leads of Career Girls flit around a sunny London encountering people from their past and recalling them via stories and whatnot; the key difference arriving in the form of the women being able to recognise and relive certain memories and engagements, those of whom they meet and are able to speak with at length often coming across as seemingly oblivious to such interactions - a result which has them appear as disturbed or as arrogant or with any other previous negative characteristics that they always had. We sense the two women, however, have advanced from their jittery; restless natures that once imbued their lives back in the day.The two women are Hannah and Annie, respectively played by Katrin Cartlidge and Lynda Steadman; Annie the one occupying the frame when we first see either of them &#x96; a train journey down to London from the north to meet with Hannah. Hannah and Annie were university students in England's capital back in the 1980s, their demeanour back then far more different to a primmer, more proper attitude to appearance and social behaviour than is evident in the present; our entrusting that they are university students, first-year freshers maybe, hand in hand with their general incarnations which calling to mind two certain Harry Enfield characters of a teen-aged ilk. Hannah is better off in life than Annie, a well dressed woman with a company car and apartment, whereas Annie is on the verge of chucking in her job. Where accusations, they of a frivolous and false sort, of misogyny blighted criticisms of the aforementioned Naked; Leigh splits a film that is all about women, and these two women specifically, down the centre page in telling an if only occasionally interesting tale, that is light on story, but is instead a somewhat charming account of these two recalling the faces and places which had the impact that they did on these two.In the 1980s, they live a grimy existence with a third girl named Claire (Byers); a small accommodation above a Chinese takeaway shop encompassing the three of them in messy living rooms and shared bedrooms. The film chops between the two strands, either of the strands with enough in them to make decent films, shorts or otherwise, as stand alone pieces, but here somewhat uncomfortably spliced together as the nature of the chaotic and unhinged past tense clashes uneasily, indeed ineffectively juxtaposes, with the brighter and more 'grown-up' present tense strand of the two of them taking trips down memory lane. Leigh proves he can rack up a certain sense of unease; the initial coming together between the two women is, we feel, fraught with mites of tension. One instance sees a flashback to an altercation involving some mugs following one of the women's present day mentioning of them, a past instance that brings back a negative memory which ends undesirably that arrives with a good use of panic and pulsating musical tones.It's too bad the rest of the film is not up to as much as this brief excursion, during which seeds of antagonism or whatnot are alluded to; the film lacking a cutting, narcissistic edge and instead plumbing for these people generally getting along swimmingly with one another in their gliding from one place to the next, frequently recognising someone of old, but sometimes not. At one point, we observe the film open up for an extended venturing of the two from apartment to apartment as Hannah looks for somewhere new to live, something encompassing odd interactions with shady real-estate folk; but it's nothing, in fact the two girls downplay the situations &#x96; where conflict seems apparent, Leigh stays in sync with the film Career Girls is and manoeuvres us around it for laugh and frolics as they merely exiting accordingly.Where tension and a fair amount of drama is maintained, lies with the ambiguity surrounding just how much of the past either of these characters can actually recall. A great deal of 1980s content gives way to the present day stuff more inclined to lending time to these people uncovering places and people of old, which while looked back upon with nostalgia in that fashion nostalgia often brings about, what actually unfolded back in the day was often quite grotty and rough. Not for a second are we entirely sure precisely what it is either woman remembers and what they don't, and if they laugh and joke about times and people of old, how much can we invest in the past strand if the resultant drama leads them to where they are now?

However, what a science fiction movie must at least attempt to do is play by the logic it has created within its own world. Contact essentially destroys everything potentially good about the movie by not following this rule. I can give most movies a little bit of a pass if the screw up on this rule in a minor way, or if finding the hole in the movies logic takes some pretty deep searching, but Contact's flaws are so idiotic and obvious that it is truly mind boggling that the director thought they were passable to be placed in the film.1. The movie tries to play Jodie Foster's character as being somewhat fringe throughout the entire movie, even after she makes the most important discovery of all time, yet then is like Ok yeah I guess we'll let you ride in the worm hole machine to represent all of earth, lol!. The movie wants to make you feel frustrated right along with Jodie's character as no one seems to want to take her completely seriously, but then as soon as it is convenient the movie just drops that notion because, well, she's the star and she's got to be the one to ride in the machine.

Shot in and around Austin, Texas, the film failed at the box office in 1993-94, but has gone on to achieve a well-deserved cult status. I never even heard of the film until this year when I saw most of it on TV and promptly decided to pick it up the DVD when I got the chance.To my mind, Dazed and Confused is one of the best high school comedy-dramas, along with 1982's Fast Times at Ridgemont High. The difference between these two films is that Fast Times contains more goofy antics whereas Dazed is more of a docudrama with amusing flashes. In other words, although Fast Times is generally realistic, excepting the over-the-top parts with Spicoli, Dazed and Confused is more like a slice from real life.What makes Dazed work so well is that it gets the LOOK of the mid-to-late 70s just right, particularly the hair & clothing styles. Secondly, the actors pull off the material expertly. In fact, a large part of the film's success is the excellent casting choices. Both are no easy feat. Speaking of the actors, you get a few up-and-comers here Matthew McConaughey, Milla Jovovich, Ben Affleck and one or two of lesser note (as far as future popularity goes).All the standard school archetypes are here the jock who parties on the side, the bullies, the hot sister and her little long-haired brother, the black dude, the hot (feminist) teacher, the streetfighter, the cool guys, the geekier crowd, the babes, the guy who graduated years ago but still hangs around, the mentors & mentees, etc.And then you have the standard school experiences like parties at friend's houses, keg parties, fleeing bullies, dealing with coaches & teachers, flirting, the possibility of sex, hanging out, meaningless conversations, fights, smoking pot at school or in your friend's bedroom, etc.Like Fast Times, Dazed and Confused is a joy to watch -- whatever your age -- because it successfully takes you back to the high school years with all its joys & agonies.Some don't like it because it's more of a slice-of-life film than a plot-driven, contrived story. The plot here is simple It's the last day of school and the youths want to celebrate. If they can't party at their friend's house (because the dad catches wind of their plans) they'll have a party at the park or wherever, but they WILL party. The rest of the film involves their interactions within this context.I've heard some complain that the film conveys a terrible message. What message? There is no message. The message is that school's out and it's time to celebrate! Besides, there are a few positive points that can be mined from the proceedings the arrogant bully gets what's coming, make a stand and fight when you have to (even if you get beat up), ultra-tight pants must be put on with pliers & the help of a friend, be true to yourself, etc. But -- really -- this isn't a movie to look for deep messages, its simple purpose is to take you back to the school years -- in this case, 1976 -- and all the fun & painful experiences thereof.No review of Dazed and Confused would be complete without noting the excellent soundtrack. You get some great rock\/metal of the 70s like Sweet Emotion, School's Out, Stranglehold, Do You Feel Like We Do, Love Hurts, Paranoid, Rock & Roll Hootchie Coo, Rock & Roll All Nite, Slow Ride, Cherry Bomb, Tuesday's Gone and many more.GRADE A ","genre":null},{"date":"24 July 2011","score":"25 out of 31 people found the following review useful","review":" Dazed and Confused details the last day of high school for the typical youths of America in 1976.

It goes around in circles, delights in throwing the viewer completely for a loop. As the movie goes round and round you're left clinging to the hope that this will all get sorted out in the end. It doesn't. When the movie ends you're left questioning everything you have just seen. What did it all mean? Did it mean anything at all? What the heck just happened here? The whole thing is extremely convoluted. Trying to sort it all out may give you a migraine. It's an ambitious effort from director Julio Medem but he never quite manages to get his puzzle to fit together perfectly.Lorenzo is a novelist living in Madrid. Lucia is a big fan of his, veering close to stalker territory. Lorenzo deems it a good idea to have Lucia, whom he has just met and knows absolutely nothing about, move in with him. Lorenzo and Lucia then have sex. Lots and lots of sex. So the movie's title makes sense. The movie itself? There are times where it is very hard to make any sense of it. Lorenzo's writing a new novel and his life and his novel become intertwined to the point it's hard to discern what is real and what is imagined. The movie jumps back and forth in time and in location, going from Madrid to an idyllic island getaway where characters turn out to be connected in very convenient ways in order to keep the story going. The story never goes in a straight line, it's all over the place. If you can't figure it out don't despair because the characters are having a heck of a time figuring it out for themselves. As we watch Lorenzo struggle with his real life and his imagined one we think we may have an advantage because the movie already told us what ultimately happens to Lorenzo way back in the first few minutes. But the way this movie goes round in circles you find that even when you think you know something you don't really know anything at all.It's definitely an intriguing story but it all gets a little too messy. The good bits and pieces don't add up to a satisfying whole. There's much to appreciate but the end result leaves you feeling a bit dazed and probably a bit disappointed. After so much confusion you're left with an ending that's really no ending at all, just raising more questions. And by the time this movie ends the last thing it needs to be doing is raising more questions. Tristán Ulloa as Lorenzo and Paz Vega as Lucia both turn in good performances in the two critical roles and they are ably supported by some other fine performers around them. The fact that the stunningly beautiful Vega is constantly naked certainly doesn't hurt the movie's appeal. She's not the only one spending plenty of time without any clothes on though. When you look at the movie's title the Sex is just as important as the Lucia. The movie probably goes a tad overboard with the sex, a little gratuitous at times. But at least the sex scenes give you moments where you can forget about the convoluted story for a bit. In the end it's that story that ultimately lets down the movie. It's one of those movies that you get the sense is trying to be a little too smart for its own good. The movie makes for interesting but ultimately somewhat frustrating viewing.

It doesn't. When the movie ends you're left questioning everything you have just seen. What did it all mean? Did it mean anything at all? What the heck just happened here? The whole thing is extremely convoluted. Trying to sort it all out may give you a migraine. It's an ambitious effort from director Julio Medem but he never quite manages to get his puzzle to fit together perfectly.Lorenzo is a novelist living in Madrid. Lucia is a big fan of his, veering close to stalker territory. Lorenzo deems it a good idea to have Lucia, whom he has just met and knows absolutely nothing about, move in with him. Lorenzo and Lucia then have sex. Lots and lots of sex. So the movie's title makes sense. The movie itself? There are times where it is very hard to make any sense of it. Lorenzo's writing a new novel and his life and his novel become intertwined to the point it's hard to discern what is real and what is imagined. The movie jumps back and forth in time and in location, going from Madrid to an idyllic island getaway where characters turn out to be connected in very convenient ways in order to keep the story going. The story never goes in a straight line, it's all over the place. If you can't figure it out don't despair because the characters are having a heck of a time figuring it out for themselves. As we watch Lorenzo struggle with his real life and his imagined one we think we may have an advantage because the movie already told us what ultimately happens to Lorenzo way back in the first few minutes. But the way this movie goes round in circles you find that even when you think you know something you don't really know anything at all.It's definitely an intriguing story but it all gets a little too messy. The good bits and pieces don't add up to a satisfying whole. There's much to appreciate but the end result leaves you feeling a bit dazed and probably a bit disappointed. After so much confusion you're left with an ending that's really no ending at all, just raising more questions. And by the time this movie ends the last thing it needs to be doing is raising more questions. Tristán Ulloa as Lorenzo and Paz Vega as Lucia both turn in good performances in the two critical roles and they are ably supported by some other fine performers around them. The fact that the stunningly beautiful Vega is constantly naked certainly doesn't hurt the movie's appeal. She's not the only one spending plenty of time without any clothes on though. When you look at the movie's title the Sex is just as important as the Lucia. The movie probably goes a tad overboard with the sex, a little gratuitous at times. But at least the sex scenes give you moments where you can forget about the convoluted story for a bit. In the end it's that story that ultimately lets down the movie. It's one of those movies that you get the sense is trying to be a little too smart for its own good. The movie makes for interesting but ultimately somewhat frustrating viewing.
