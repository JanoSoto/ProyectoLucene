There are no parts in this entire movie that get more than a mild chuckle out of you, making you wonder if this movie was really intended to be funny. This movie, however, was a pretty decent suspense\/thriller with a couple of nice twists. Steve Martin is a dentist who seems to have everything going for him. He is engaged to a pretty and intelligent woman, Jean (Laura Dern), he is a respected part of the community, and he is making a good living. But the grass is always greener, it seems, as he begins to lust for a trashy junkie who ends up in the dentist's chair, Susan (Helena Bonham Carter). She convinces him to prescribe her drugs and things start to spin out of control. Soon he is suspected for the homicide of her brother Duane (Scott Caan). Overall, this movie is well acted, headlined by Steve Martin and Helena Bonham Carter. I totally buy Steve Martin as the straight guy as he slowly loses control of his life and what is there to say about Helene Bonham Carter? She is a great actress, there is no doubt about that. This part may have been a little bit beneath her level of talent, but she puts all that she can into it. She is a perfect seductress and plays Martin's character right into her hands. Scott Caan and Elias Koteas do a good job in smaller roles. Kevin Bacon, in an uncredited role, definitely steals the scenes that he is in though. He plays an actor studying the role of a cop for an upcoming movie. He plays it so seriously that they are easily the most humorous parts of the movie.Overall, this movie is not bad, but it could have been better as well. Tuning in, expecting to see a dark comedy, I was anticipating a little more humor than this movie produced, but it does satisfy as a suspense\/thriller and was a pleasant surprise for a movie with a couple of stars that did not get a wide theatrical release.

Tuning in, expecting to see a dark comedy, I was anticipating a little more humor than this movie produced, but it does satisfy as a suspense\/thriller and was a pleasant surprise for a movie with a couple of stars that did not get a wide theatrical release. I recommend it as a movie that is worth at least a rental.

I used to imagine that I was Reese, coming back from the future, saving Sarah Connor and all that. Me and my friend Adrian watched the movie on VHS in it's entirety at least twice a day for the duration of one summer, then rewound to the police station scene to watch Arnold give all of those poor, doomed police officers hell. Needless to say, we liked the movie somewhat.Then in 1991, we went to see the sequel, the day before it was being released nationally.I remember sitting through the opening future sequence with my jaw on my lap thinking to myself, If only the first one had these effects. From then on, it was another two hours plus of pure Terminator bliss. Me and Adrian walked out of the theater laughing hysterically, happy that we had new fodder to abuse on the VCR (well, we'd have to wait a bit but ultimately, we got it pretty quick).This is one of those rare cases of a sequel done right. The film does have a couple of problems but nothing that ruins it overall. Everything was taken from its original minimalist approach and pumped up to the maximum. The action scenes were without a doubt, unbelievable. The acting was uniformly great, every character given life with none of them being under developed. The story was surprisingly emotional. Just the fact that I wanted to cry for a cyborg that was getting trashed really bad at one point, I'll give Cameron his credit. Especially when mentioning the performance of Linda Hamilton, who was a shivering coward in the first one. You see her here, it's like looking into the eyes of a caged animal. If memory serves me, she wasn't nominated for this performance and it's just a crying shame. The special effects... wow. At the time, morphing had just been unleashed and this movie, believe it or not, basically set the standards for the special effects that you're seeing today. You have to understand that watching this when it was first released was nothing short of breathtaking. It was almost as if somewhere in the recesses of your brain, you somehow knew that you were being a witness to history. I'll never forget watching this in the theaters that first night, how the audience reacted to the emergence of the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) from the blazing wreck of the tow truck in the canal. I swear you could've heard people hold their breath for a moment, then breaking out into thundering applause and hoots and hollers when he morphed into his human self. The film was filled with moments like this and I feel that's why it's such an enduring flick. If you haven't seen this, you really need to stop looking up reader reviews on IMDB and get yourself a video rental card or something. Get with it, man!Which leads me to the inevitable question. How does it hold up to the big, bad original? Well, I've gotta say that I love both movies. After reading my above thoughts on the movie, you may be surprised to hear that I actually prefer the original. As great as the sequel is, the grittiness of the first one is what does it for me. Yeah, T2 had everything plus the kitchen sink thrown in but the first one had this feeling to it, this feeling of death, darkness and destruction. For some reason while writing this, I thought of this analogy to sum up what I think about the differing moods of the movie T2 was a crystal clear, beautiful, streak-free window. The first Terminator was the same window with a dirty, dingy rock thrown through it. I think it makes sense. You could probably attribute the griminess of the first one to its low budget roots but that's what makes it work so much better. The sequel is a bit too crisp, too neat, too clean. Don't get me wrong, the film looks great but then again, I'm the kind of person that loves the murkiness of Se7en.Another thing, and this is where my main beef lies. Some people like the new and improved minigun wielding Terminator. The shoot 'em in the knees in order to spare them their lives Terminator. The joke-cracking Terminator. I am not one of those people. I like the quiet Terminator. The one that speaks only when he absolutely needs to. The Terminator that drives a car through the front lobby of a police station and comes out holding an assault rifle and an automatic shotgun. The one that absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead. The sequel's Terminator is a little more PC and given the general message of the sequel, requires him to be so. But taking away from this character what made him so popular the first time around kind of tips the scales in the original's favor, in my opinion anyway.There are a few other things that make me like the original better than the sequel as well. For instance, the runtime for T2 is pretty hefty with a middle section that drags a bit, where the first one is nice and lean, with no slow parts whatsoever. I remember while watching the movie initially, I got annoyed a couple of times near the end. The violence, while still strong, isn't on the level of the first. There's a preachiness to the sequel that gets annoying at times. What it speaks of is of great importance, true, but there's moments in T2 that almost made me roll my eyes. Edward Furlong, here playing the young John Connor, gives a good performance but comes off as whiny more often than he should. His voice squeaks in a way that sounds like nails on a chalkboard on occasion. I'll cut him some slack though, being that he was probably just going through puberty at the time of filming.I've probably spent more time than I should have on comparing the two films. I'll finish with this T2 is an amazing motion picture. If you are an action fan, this is a movie for you to see. It holds up well to repeat viewings and has some amazing special effects, with a villain that goes down as one of the more memorable I can think of. It's rare nowadays to get a movie that has this amount of special effects that weren't thrown in just for the sake of it. The special effects serve the story and push it forward, like it's supposed to do. The story is emotionally heavy and will definitely make you think of technology advancement in our age in a different way.Lastly, it's one of those few sequels that actually doesn't ruin the memory of the first film.

Maxwell Caulfield played Rex Manning, the character you love to hate. Anthony LaPaglia played Joe who was one of the best managers that you could work for. The actor's attitude toward his role was very well displayed. Rory Cochrane played Lucas, who is my favorite character in this movie. Then there is Johnny Whitworth, now everybody sort of disinclueds him or doesn't like him but I think that he did a good job as AJ, I could not see anyone else there, maybe someone could have done a better job but he did well. The rest of the cast was fantastic. The plot of the film was a little non existent, it's more like a series of events that just go one after the other with no really flow. Anyways, take the movie for what it is teenagers working at a record store, dealing with life issues with good music playing in the background. This is a great film.

CAT BALLOU is one of those movies I always thought I should see but never did -- that is, until Turner Classic Movies did me the favor tonight. It is a good movie, for anyone in the mood for a western spoof. Catherine (Cat) Ballou returns from college, a new teacher, her dad is killed, she turns outlaw to avenge his death. Happy, funny crooks help her. Save her at the last minute from a hanging. In fact, Cat (Jane Fonda) is the only serious one in the whole movie. Good singing by Nat King Cole, right before he died. But overall a very forgettable movie, not as funny as they wanted you to think it is.

If you don't get this, you don't understand satire and camp when you see it. The take-offs on older westerns (and comtemporary ones) are so obvious they slap you in the face, much like Mel Brooks Young Frankenstein. I absolutely love both movies and watch them every time they are on. The plot, as in Y.F. is not the point, obviously,  it's the old Over The Hill (or drunk) Gunfighter,  Revenge for My Father's Death, I Won't Never Give Up My Land, themes that are all crammed into this romp and affectionately made fun of.   I would disagree that Fonda could never act(remember Klute?) and I think Lee Marvin won for THIS movie, as he deserved to.

Paul Newman and Tom Hanks give out a hell of a show, and Tom Hanks is certainly one of the most intelligent and talented actors i have seen.

I started to watch it ready to be hugely disappointed but what a relief!!!!The movie is fantastic - so coherent in its form. Each element - the plot,acting,stunts and visual effects sequences, even choreography and costumes are so perfectly blended together in a horribly stupid movie. If I had watched it expecting some exciting sf action thriller my head would have probably exploded but right from the start the director blinks to the viewer as if he wanted to say don't be afraid, it's a really good satire mocking all those schematic stereotypes that are a real cancer of contemporary action movies. And it is - visual effects and fight sequences are ripped directly from Matrix and Crouching Tiger... and when some elements are original they are extremely stupid...and entertaining. All the elements that I mentioned earlier mock most typical clichés and even go beyond that. The actors have to say one of the most artificial dialogs I have ever heard in a movie. The plot and the development of the story is like it was written by a 8 year old boy who previously spend a year in front of computer playing kung-fu games and watching Texas Ranger and Baywatch Nights (or sth like that). I strongly believe...it is all made deliberately. For those unwilling to notice it from the start, the director prepared the great ending which is so unrealistic (this world with bright sharp colors - look what those people are wearing, what they look like!!!!).And of course the great sequence with Li the villain (Mortal Kombat rip) who fights with the whole colony of prisoners and the camera live him there. Outstanding, hilarious, well made and intelligent - especially because some may think that it was a serious sf\/action ... something. On the other hand I may be wrong - it can be sf\/action something prepared by the Forrest Gump's brother (not offending Mr. Gump). However, I really enjoyed it and anxiously wait for the next serious hidden parody from Mr. Wong. 8,5 out of 10.
