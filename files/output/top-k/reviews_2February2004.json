Part of me respects him for changing our perspective of genres (comedy, action, westerns, horror, etc.), but he also deserves disdain for not trying to push limits in a serious manner.  Consider how Spielberg pushed limits in his early work up until 'E.T.'  Oh, how I wish Donner did the same.  We would really have something to look into.  On the plus side, Donner usually gets decent tech crews and artists for his work.The original 'Lethal Weapon' trilogy is a trademark of the 80s.  Stylized flash overdose mixed with lame plots--drug dealers, Nazis, and crooked cops.  They parody what we consider serious in an Arnold or Seagal movie, but still try to be dramatic.  I find the original to be the best because it balances the different influences best.Now with '4', we have a parody of the first three.  The plot is less contrived this time--Triads and smuggling--but still simple.  I wasn't expecting 'Ronin', but considering the budget you'd think something more detailed could have been written.  Some interesting things to consider--The human tank opening is the most interesting set piece in the trilogy.  Notice how the characters don't go on three like before.--The chases are in the let's top the last big event like before.  I think '3' had the best chase, but that's only because of the way it was shot.--Pesci does his warp-speed routine again.  Rock doesn't play off it as well.So, sadly, we end the series on a downer.  Donner hasn't recovered.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud ","genre":null},{"date":"2 February 2004","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  This is your only spoiler warning...Donner is a fickle director.
