[{"date":"10 March 2014","score":"","review":" Released in 1999 Ride with the Devil is a Civil War tale focusing on Southern guerrilla fighters known as Bushwhackers, mostly young men who stage daring raids on Union forces and communities along the Missouri\/Kansas border. The story includes Quantrill's infamous 1963 raid on Lawrence, Kansas, which he burned & pillaged and murdered over 150 unarmed men, women and children.The story shines the spotlight on the son of a German immigrant (Tobey Maguire aka Spider-man), a beautiful woman (Jewel) and an ex-slave (Jeffrey Wright), all of whom take up the Southern cause. I enjoyed how Tobey and Wright slowly develop a close friendship, as well as Wright's growing sense of freedom as the story progresses. Jewel makes an impressive acting debut and should do more films, she's a natural.One reviewer erroneously stated that the film ran 3 hours so I was surprised when the credits started rolling at the 2 hour and 13 minute mark. In fact, I was disappointed because I wanted the story to continue; this is a sign of a good film. The story takes its time and gradually pulls you in.Before viewing Ride with the Devil I caught the new Indiana Jones flick Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. The contrast couldn't be more different -- Crystal Skull is essentially a 2-hour Road Runner cartoon, whereas Ride is a totally realistic drama\/Western. Although I enjoyed Crystal Skull for what it is, it can't be taken serious for even a second, not to mention they overdid it with the over-the-top action and fake cgi location enhancements & props (cliffs, waterfalls, jungles, monkeys, etc.). Ride with the Devil is the perfect antidote to such loony-toon drivel. It's totally realistic and takes its time so you get to know the characters and FEEL their experiences. For instance, what's it like spending the entire Winter in a dugout hut in the woods with three other guys and the only highlight is some cute blond stopping by to drop off food? What's it like when you have no other recourse but to saw a buddy's arm off? What's it like when a blood-thirsty comrade tries to kill you during battle? What do you do when you run into him two years later and you're not sure what his intentions are? The film was shot in Western Missouri and Eastern Kansas where the conflicts actually took place. Authentic locations are vital to this viewer. After all, how are we to accept the film's visualization of history if it wasn't shot where the actual events occurred? I encourage you to view the film with the subtitles on as the language is sometimes hard to understand due to accents and archaic phrasing; this will help you follow what's going on and who's who.FINAL ANALYSIS Ride with the Devil is reminiscent in quality & style of films like Cold Mountain, Pharoah's Army and The Long Riders. If you appreciate those films you'll enjoy Ride. It's leagues better than the generally aloof and soporific Gettysburg. It's a class 'A' picture which brings to life Quantrill's raid on Lawrence, Kansas, including what leads up to it and what follows -- how can you go wrong?The DVD includes Jewel's music video for the song What's Simple is True.

The buddy is Dave (Ed Harris), a bachelor and drunkard who lives with his sister, Martha (Kathy Baker), in their inherited parent's house in the old neighborhood. Dave & Martha's situation has degenerated into lifeless habit and stagnation. Megs doesn't look up Dave because he necessarily wants to but because he has to -- they have a longstanding date to go fishing, a date with much significance.Kathy is a biology teacher and the classic enabler, a one-woman support system enabling her brother to continue in his miserable cycle of booze\/hangover\/booze. She's trapped and her guilt will not let her escape, and she knows shes trapped.There's a scene of Kathy leaving the school at the end of her work day where she goes out of her way to stop at the trophy case and looks at old pictures of her brother when he was a high school hero with much potential. You can feel what she feels as she looks at those pictures.Dave warns Kathy about Megs -- he's half crazy and has spent a lot of time in the slammer on assault charges, but Kathy instinctively senses that Megs is their catalyst to change, their delivererer, carbuncles and all. Yet Megs needs change as well, and Kathy is HIS deliverer. Megs is an eccentric outcast and Kathy is his golden connection to a sense of family and community, things he's been running from since he got out of the war 20 years earlier.Kathy is a bit of a plain Jane. Her stagnated lifestyle is reflected on her face. No one invited her to her Prom back in high school and who knows the last time she had a date. Yet on her initial meeting with Megs he just happens to mention she's pretty. This immediately changes her demeanor. When was the last time she felt the warmth of a genuine compliment concerning her looks? She naturally starts to develop love for this man -- a deeply flawed man -- something she hasn't felt for a long, long time, perhaps never. And she slowly starts to blossom.Jacknife is the perfect antidote to modern cgi-laden drivel like Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and Iron Man. Don't get me wrong, those types of films have their place, like when you're in the mood for mindless entertainment -- goofy one-liners and all. By contrast, Jacknife is meaningful and character-driven; suspense is created via raw, unpredictable emotion and outstanding acting (by all three members of the triangle). Take, for instance, the truck-driving scene where Dave and Megs have a confrontation. Megs starts to put the meddle to the peddle as they drive down an incline. Dave had implied that Megs was crazy and now Megs is making a statement. Or is he? Who knows what he's doing?! The truck goes faster and faster and the viewer is uncertain if this lunatic is going to kill 'em both or what.This scene is potent because it strikes the viewer as REAL. For me it brought to memory a similar situation when my wife and I were traveling through the heart of West Virginia. We drove in silence for a long time, perhaps two hours, and then I completely exploded, screaming at the top of my lungs -- spit and tears flying. Yet I wasn't yelling at her -- not at all -- it went much deeper than that. We were flying down the highway faster and faster while I continued to vent in raw emotion. Then my wife, the epitome of calm and stable, screams out, IF YOU'RE GOING TO WRECK MAKE SURE YOU KILL US BOTH!!! That was almost four years ago and, thankfully, nothing like it has happened since. Why do I bring this experience up? Because Jacknife, albeit a tad stagy (which is natural since it was based on a play), rings so true.The film was shot on location in the heart of Connecticut in Meriden, Cromwell and Wethersfield (the diner scene). The story obviously takes place in November and the authentic locations are great.BOTTOM LINE If you're in the mood for a meaningful, character-driven drama you can't go wrong with Jacknife.

Seagal masquerades as a do-gooder helping people with his carpentry skills and living at a local church, but mogul's cronies are on to him and try to chase him away.The plot kinda reminds me of Clint Eastwood's 1985 Pale Rider (which borrowed heavily from Shane). A lone stranger comes into town and befriends the common folks, saving them from the evil tycoon and his motley crew. The difference is that Fire Down Below is an Eastern rather than a Western and it takes place in modern times. Seagal may not have the supernatural overtones of Clint in Pale Rider but his heroics are so fantastical he comes off a bit supernatural just the same.Seagal, of course, is a highly likable protagonist. He's ultra-confident, cool and soft-spoken at all times; and he knows how to kick some serious arse. Numerous times throughout the film he takes on multiple attackers and wins without even breaking a sweat. Unbelievable? Yes, but Seagal makes it believable. He is, after all, 6'4, dressed in cool black threads and a master of all kinds of martial arts.Some say Seagal's a bad actor, but this isn't true. If someone is giving a bad acting performance you can tell because there's an awkward air to their delivery and you don't buy them in the role. This is not the case with Steven. Never for a second does the viewer question Seagal as the protagonist. It may be the only character Seagal can play, but he does it well.Plus Seagal has numerous great one-liners throughout the film. For instance, late in the film he confronts his EPA colleague who has sold out to Kristofferson and says, You're a piece of s*** and I'm ashamed of you. The line is perfect and perfectly delivered, not to mention so true-to-life. Hasn't anyone ever betrayed you, abused you or disappointed you to the point where you finally give up with the realization that they're just a shameless and shameful piece of s***?One of the best highlights for me is the gorgeous Appalachian locations and cinematography. The picture was filmed on location in SE Kentucky -- Hazzard, Mt. Vernon and points between to be exact. I feel Appalachia is largely under-utilized in filmmaking and greatly enjoy it when films take advantage of this magnificent area of the USA.Seagal's romantic interest is played by Marge Halgenberger, who became popular a few years after this film starring in TV's CSI. She's very believable as the local infamous woman who has a strange relationship with her brother, played by Stephen Lang.Another highlight is the blues\/country music heard throughout the picture. It turns out that Seagal wrote or co-wrote many of the songs featured and even performs one on camera. I never even knew he was a musician! There's even a country-ish Jimi Hendrix song. Plus a couple Country stars make cameos, like Marty Stuart and Travis Tritt.FINAl ANALYSIS Fire Down Below falters a bit in the final act but, other than that, I love this film. It has everything you'd expect in a film that takes place in hillbilly country -- good family folks, rednecks, poverty, coal mines, brawls, alcohol, pot farms, backcountry churches, incest and country music. The best feature for me is the genuine Appalachian locations and photography. Add likable Steven Seagal to the mix and you have a winner! As another reviewer has stated, Seagal has a totally winning personality -- a hero with a heart of purest gold. He's certainly someone worth emulating in my book. In fact, in this film he represents all (or most) of the qualities of authentic manhood missing in our current society that celebrates effeminized and weak men (another good example would be Clint Walker in 1966' Night of the Grizzly).Lastly, I should warn action fans that this is hardly an all-out action film. Yes, there are action pieces interspersed throughout, but they flash by with a few blinks of an eye. Fire Down Below is a drama\/action\/thriller wherein the story plays out fairly leisurely, but with bursts of great violence. Although Under Siege is technically a better film and arguably Seagal's all-time best picture, I personally favor Fire Down Below for the reasons cited above.The film runs 105 minutes.

The best feature for me is the genuine Appalachian locations and photography. Add likable Steven Seagal to the mix and you have a winner! As another reviewer has stated, Seagal has a totally winning personality -- a hero with a heart of purest gold. He's certainly someone worth emulating in my book. In fact, in this film he represents all (or most) of the qualities of authentic manhood missing in our current society that celebrates effeminized and weak men (another good example would be Clint Walker in 1966' Night of the Grizzly).Lastly, I should warn action fans that this is hardly an all-out action film. Yes, there are action pieces interspersed throughout, but they flash by with a few blinks of an eye. Fire Down Below is a drama\/action\/thriller wherein the story plays out fairly leisurely, but with bursts of great violence. Although Under Siege is technically a better film and arguably Seagal's all-time best picture, I personally favor Fire Down Below for the reasons cited above.The film runs 105 minutes.

Death's deal with Parrish is that, as long as he's entertained, he'll delay Bill's death. Mr. Death emerges as a mysterious stranger with child-like qualities known as 'Joe Black.' His holiday is complicated when he falls in love with Parrish's daughter (Claire Forlani).This film is 3 hours long but is so captivating that it feels shorter than most 90-minute mindless action flicks. The plot is reminiscent of other good fish out of water stories like Spock in Star Trek, etc. Yes, it's outlandish but the film expertly presents the bizarre situation in a totally believable manner. In other words, this is indeed a serious drama, which nicely balances out the heavy moments with lighter (humorous) touches. I would compare it to The Green Mile which was another long drama with supernatural touches and wholly captivating.Despite its outlandish premise, Meet Joe Black consistently offers profound insights to the most vital topics of the human experience -- love, life, death and numerous others (e.g. betrayal, hostility, comeuppance and the mysterious beyond).One good example is when Parrish's son-in-law offers a definition of love to Joe Black (aka Mr. Death) To know the worst thing about someone and it's okay.This is just one example; the film is filled with such insights.Meet Joe Black cost $90 million to make and only made half of it back at the USA box office.

Inevitably, of course, this means that men that are branded as outlaws have become a part of all that. One such gang of outlaws was the one led by Frank and Jesse James that terrorized a large chunk of the Midwest in the years following the Civil War, and right up to the first years of the 20th century. That legend, unsurprisingly, has seen its share of films being made by Hollywood. But perhaps the most provocative of the bunch is the one made by action film stalwart Walter Hill at the turn of the 1980s. That film was THE LONG RIDERS.This take on the venerable outlaw legend is notable for having sets of brothers play the outlaws Stacy and James Keach play the James Brothers'; the Carradines (Keith, Robert, David) are the Youngers; the Quaids (Dennis and Randy) play the Miller Brothers; and Christopher and Nicholas Guest portray the Fords. During the 1870s and 1880s, these men rack up a series of felonies so long and so brutal that they become oversized legends of their time, and quickly become the focus of the equally legendary Pinkerton detective agency (the frontier forerunner to the FBI). But the methods the Pinkertons use to hunt down the James\/Younger boys are not only unconventional, but even criminal at times themselves, earning the scorn of a lot of people, especially those close to the boys in the states of Missouri and Tennessee. The end result is a blood-soaked affair that climaxes when the gang attempts to rob a bank in Northfield, Minnesota, in a raid that only nets them a lot of bloodshed since it was all set up by the Pinkertons and that the entire town was waiting for them. All three of the Youngers are so badly wounded that the Jameses abandon them. Those that are not wounded are eventually captured by the Pinkertons. Only the Fords were ever offered a deal to turn state's evidence and track down the James Brothers, which they indeed took.Made on what was a fairly sizeable budget for a Western ($10 million), THE LONG RIDERS did, however, score quite well at the box office; and as a result, the film was perhaps the last great Western to be a hit before the monstrous critical and box office debacle of HEAVEN'S GATE came along at year's end in 1980, all but decimating the Western as a genre. Hill and his crew were sticklers for authenticity, and it shows in every frame of the film, with each set of acting brothers doing convincing turns as the outlaws, and with Pamela Reed giving a fine turn as soon-to-be-outlaw cowgirl Belle Starr, a loose associate of the James\/Younger gang. Given the period in which it was made, no one should be surprised that the outlaws are seen as the heroes, and the Pinkertons as more or less the heavies (since their methods of hunting down the gang are terribly unethical at times). And since Hill wrote the screenplay for director Sam Peckinpah's 1972 crime thriller classic THE GETAWAY, and loosely studied under that director, no one should be shocked either that THE LONG RIDERS is a fairly violent film, with bloody shootouts rendered in slow-motion (though Hill's editing style is not as cascading, nor quite as memorable, as Peckinpah's was for, say, THE WILD BUNCH).Filmed primarily on locations in northern California, Texas, and Georgia, THE LONG RIDERS benefits greatly not only from its casting and its period authenticity, but also from the rustic, down-home country\/folk music score by Americana legend Ry Cooder, who would work again with Hill on films like STREETS OF FIRE, SOUTHERN COMFORT, TRESPASS, JOHNNY HANDSOME, LAST MAN STANDING, and GERONIMO AN American LEGEND. It is sad that the Western genre had basically entered its twilight by the time THE LONG RIDERS was released, and that HEAVEN'S GATE (released, ironically, by the same studio, United Artists) would all but bury it in the ground for a long time, because this film has a lot to recommend to it. It belongs squarely in the traditions that both Peckinpah and Sergio Leone set forth in the 1960s, that in which the demarcation between black and white was really quite gray, and where right and wrong were determined by the participants, and not a half-baked sense of morality.

Basically New York University students and friends Bill Gambini (The Karate Kid's Ralph Macchio) and Stan Rothenstein (Friends' Mitchell Whitfield) are driving through Alabama, and stopping at a local convenience store, and moments after they leave the store clerk is shot dead, and the two young men are pulled over by the police and arrested on suspicion of robbery and murder, and unless they can prove their innocence they will face execution. With no money to pay for a lawyer Bill calls his mother, he is told that there is an attorney in the family, Bill's cousin 'Vinny', Vincent LaGuardia Gambini (Joe Pesci), who travels to help them, bringing his fiancée Mona Lisa Vito (Oscar winning Marisa Tomei) with him, but the Brooklyn based cousin is a personal injury lawyer, not an experienced attorney in trial, but he is able to fool the court judge Chamberlain Haller (The Munsters' Fred Gwynne) that he is qualified to go ahead with the case. A game of cat and mouse progresses trial, with Vinny being ignorant to basic court procedures and dress code, an often aggressive attitude, and not cross- examining any witnesses brought onto the stand, Jim Trotter III (Lois & Clark's Lane Smith) seems to have the case on his side, only missing a murder weapon to convict the young men, Stan fires Vinny and hires public defender John Gibbons (Austin Pendleton). The trial opens again, Vinny has been given another chance by Bill who he defends, wearing a snazzy secondhand tuxedo that is an improvement compared to his leathers, while Gibbons defends Stan, but Vinny does make up for his inexperience and ignorance paying close attention to witness statements, especially shortsighted Sam Tipton (Maury Chaykin), using his aggression to his advantage with penetrating questions, Billy's faith is restored and Stan fires Gibbons, while Vinny does get some needed sleep resting in a cell for contempt of court. In trial Vinny continues to be a more than capable cross-examiner, but Trotter brings in surprise witness FBI analyst George Wilbur (Independence Day's James Rebhorn) who analysed that during the crime a car drove away, and the tyre tracks and chemical analysis match and are identical to Billy's car, and going to lunch Vinny thinks the case is lost, and has a bad argument with Lisa that seemingly breaks their engagement. Looking through some of her photographs however Vinny spots something that could be key to the case, Billy's car does not have all the same mechanics as the getaway vehicle to make the tracks found at the scene of the crime, and he uses an initially not happy Lisa as a witness, as she has great knowledge of car mechanics from working in her father's garage, and she confirms that the vehicle in question can easily be mistaken for another of the same colour and same type of tyres. Wilbur confirms this testimony, Sheriff Farley (Bruce McGill) also confirms that two men matching the descriptions of the witnesses were arrested in another county driving a stolen car and in possession of a gun of the calibre used to kill the clerk, Trotter dismisses all charges against Bill and Stan, they are released, and Vinny and Lisa leave bickering about their wedding plans. Also starring Paulene Meyers as Constance Riley, Raynor Scheine as Ernie Crane, Chris Ellis as J.T. and Michael Simpson as Neckbrace. Pesci is great fun as the wisecracking and lovably aggressive title character, and Tomei does indeed almost steal the show as the Brooklyn girlfriend who comes across like a typical snobby bimbo but actually knows more than she lets on, this is definitely an alternative to the more serious and dramatic court case films you would come to expect, this one definitely mocks the law system in a way, the best laughs come from Pesci being incompetent in court and Tomei with her eccentric behaviour, I think she is a good unusual choice to win an Oscar, a funny and watchable comedy. Very good!
