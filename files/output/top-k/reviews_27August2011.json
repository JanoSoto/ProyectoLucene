It is that life is a game of chance and therefore you cannot foresee or predict the future, however you can make slight adjustments that will steer chance towards a more favorable outcome. The film has many scenes which link a series of shots together creating an overall story. The plot is based on a theory called the butterfly affect; for each alternative interaction created there is an alternative reality for the situation as well as alternative realities for those touched. This theory is otherwise known as the chaos theory; small differences in reality can cause an array of alternative outcomes. Lola in the film is taking this approach to try and perfect her reactions to the sticky situation by taking the more passive approach to things. The shots of people on the street were filmed to link into this idea which is that in each scenario, it may lead to alternative reactions to the situation. For instance the woman walking down the street that Lola runs into with a stroller can either become a greedy gambler or a saint depending on what reality was handed to her. One reality Lola runs into her and a snipped of the woman's future flashes, displaying her leading a life of greed. The alternative reality shown later in the film shows Lola running past the woman which changes her reality and instead of becoming a gambler, she becomes a devoted Christian. So what is reality in this film? Reality is a game of chance; however the characters have the power to change their realities. This film throws your mind into a time warp, thwarting you from scene to scene, shot to shot, throwing your mind into an allusive world of chaos and order. The viewer becomes thrown in and out of reality and leaves you guessing was that real? That is the beauty of this film, the characters have the power to change reality and create a more favorable approach. Other films such as The Butterfly Effect have approached the same idea however Run Lola, Run takes a more cinematic approach to the idea is an exquisite proverbial display of the characters. The movie was a perfect concoction of action, suspense, drama, with a delightful twist on reality.

Well if you want to see it then you won't really find it here. What you will find is good performances from the two, but with a fairly weak script and a story that mildly entertains. The Morning After is the story about a washed up actress who wakes up with a hangover next to a dead man one morning. She has no recollection of the previous night and no idea what to do with herself in this situation. She finds help from a mysterious young man named Turner Kendall, played by Jeff Bridges, but suspense and mystery build as her situation becomes increasingly dire. She doesn't know if this strange Turner character is a blessing or a curse and whether she should trust him, or be deathly afraid of him. And so the mystery begins in this halfway decent suspense thriller of which there's not a whole lot to say.The Morning After is helped by strong performances and an engaging story that leads you on to want to know the outcome. It is hurt by a weak script and the lack of originality it faces in its midsection. It starts out strong, opening with Jane Fonda's character waking up in bed next to a man with a knife in his chest. She panics and leaves the apartment she is in and tries to get her situation under control before she decides what to do with the body. During this panic she meets Turner, and this is where the mystery begins.The film builds its suspense nicely, but after a while it starts to flat line and doesn't get any more interesting until the end. A romance begins between Fonda and Bridges, not unexpectedly to say the least, and for a while nothing much happens. The two characters are developed and their relationship grows, but after a while it becomes redundant and their back stories don't end up being all that creative. Fonda is an actress who used to be big and has now fallen into obscurity. Bridges was a big shot cop who suffered an injury and is now a nobody. These character profiles are important to the overall arc of the story, but they don't make our two main characters all too interesting, leading the film as a whole to not be all too interesting. Plus, we have a script that leaves a lot to be desired. But when the film finally comes to its conclusion it isn't something I saw coming, but in retrospect I probably should have been able to see it from a mile away. I can, however, give the movie credit for having a very exciting climax, but that leads into a final scene which wraps the film up a little too nicely.When you get right down to it, The Morning After is just sort of there. It isn't great, it isn't terrible, but it isn't something I will remember. I won't be thinking about this film in a few weeks and I might not even remember watching it.

Granted, the concept of good Americans versus evil Nazis is a bit too simplistic when it comes to cinematic treatments. Those viewers who want to read so much of that into the picture are missing one of Spielberg's main goals - 'How do you find decency in the hell of warfare'? That question reverberates around the central plot, the mission to rescue a sole surviving brother who's three siblings have all perished in the same war already. For the eight members of the rescue team, the quandary is presented in terms of moral prerogatives - why potentially sacrifice so many soldiers at the expense of just one, who may already be dead anyway? Moral dilemmas abound in the story. Ed Burns's Private Reiben challenges Captain Miller's (Tom Hanks) decision to release a German soldier on his own recognizance to turn himself over to an American patrol. Private Caparzo's compassion for the young French girl in the bombed out town is seen by the Captain as a life or death threat to his unit, and must decide for the greater good of his men. Even when Miller's Rangers finally achieve their objective and find Private Ryan (Matt Damon), the situation does not play out in straightforward fashion. Ryan resolutely refuses to be 'rescued', instead seeing that alternative as abandoning his own men. By what right should he be so singularly absolved of his duty to serve and protect his country? My summary line above captures the essence of Miller's response and observation, knowing that his duty and his humanity are in obvious conflict.This conundrum creates another dynamic in the story, reverting back to the character of Private Reiben. When Ryan was anonymous, it was easy enough to dismiss him as some nameless, faceless soldier who didn't warrant any special kind of treatment. Up close and personal however, Ryan proves his value as a soldier in battle, side by side with Reiben in the German tank ambush at Rammel. These perspectives are not typical in your average war movie, and make the film far more interesting than if it had taken a more documentary like approach, as in the opening half hour of the film with the landing on Omaha Beach.Perhaps the most complex character, and the one I had the hardest time with was Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies). By virtually all of his responses to battle conditions and enemy encounters, he was an outright coward. His singular moment of bravery was enacted with some measure of revenge against Steamboat Willie, the German soldier who's life was spared earlier in the picture. Willie provided Upham with a reason to overcome his distaste for war, by abrogating an implied trust they shared over a cigarette. Upham had his reason and motivation to kill Willie, while allowing the remaining Germans to escape. For Upham, the war had to become personal for him to take action, and that's no way to survive in conflict.So for me, Saving Private Ryan isn't just a war film, and if you view it through that lens, the film loses much of it's impact, even with the brutality of Omaha Beach and the tank battle at the bridge. To be sure, the picture succeeds at capturing the intense horror of war, but it's power as a film goes deeper when it identifies with it's characters and examines their relationships with each other as soldiers and men.

Mario Puzo's The Godfather is one of those films that is perfect. Being based of off the best seller by Mario Puzo, director Francis Ford Coppola creates one of the most accurate portrayals of an Italian crime family. When most people think about films that deal with the Mafia, Italian gangsters, what they think about is people that ship drugs, deal with prostitution, and above all else, just fight others for the hell of it. But, what makes The Godfather so different is that, contrary to the rather dark, violent nature of the film, this movie destroys all stereo types as it becomes a film that is not, at all, about running a crime family. This film is REALLY about a father trying to pass his legacy and empire to one of his sons and that one son having to come to terms with his own legacy and the choices he makes. When Mario Puzo decided to originally write the novel that this film is based on, he did it only for the money and nothing else. But what he did not expect was to have his entire creation take a complete life of it's own in a way that only few people can imagine. Even more so was the shock of how well this film did. Want a little taste of how well this film did? Before the film was even released, The Godfather Part II was already in development. But, more on that later. Now, my complete reaction to watching this film. To say that this is one of my personal favorite films of all time would be something of a drastic understatement. With me, there are some films that you like and some that change your life. This is one of those films that changes your life with each and every viewing. When I first sat down and watched this film, I remember feeling complete once the credits started to role. I know that sounds cheap, but it is true. Everything from the story to they way Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is in this film, it just spoke to me in a way that very few films can ever do. And I am not the only one that felt this way. There is a magic in this movie that can never be paralleled and the closes that we get (and one that is pretty damn close at that) is the sequel that is said to be equal to better then this film. But more on that later. Let's get down to the details. With direction, Coppola does wonders. He keeps the story moving, never dragging behind, and keeps making you interested with the look of the film. While some have complained about the lighting used as being too dark of a film or too gold, I say that the use of that is, quite fantastic. The reason why is because it always sets the mood for the scene and the tone that you will end up feeling. Plus, little added in items like the use of oranges in some scenes give this film a little kick by letting the audience know that something is about to go down. For the direction, Coppola, you do wonders. And the Academy Award for Best Direction was well won and deserved. Now the acting. Oh, my God. What can I say? Well, let's think. Marlon Brando won the Academy Award for Best Actor and Al Pacino won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Need I say more? Okay, I will talk about the supporting cast. With huge names like Richard Dreyfus, James Caan, Abe Vigoda, and Diane Keaton, this film is filled with some of the greatest talent that money can buy. But what shocks me the most is that they treat this film with such a tone of seriousness that they literally stop becoming themselves and become these incredible people. Next the score. Like so many classic films, this film's score is something of a staple in film history. Mostly due to the famous 'The Godfather Waltz', Nina Rota became a household name in the music world due to the simplicity of that piece. It was simple, yet set the tone perfectly. The only crime that has ever been done on this film was the score not being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score. Oh well. Later on, this film saga will get it's award. Finally the script. Being adapted from the novel by Mario Puzo, and being written by him and Coppola, this film mirrors the novel so closely that you would only have to read the novel to know more about the extra characters that are not THAT huge. The dialogue is authentic, honest, and bold as this well written script is presented. The Academy Award for Best adapted Screen play was also well deserved. Overall, this entire film is worthy of the magnitude that it has gotten, the awards it has won (including Best Film), and the hearts and souls it has touched.

I appreciate the slow-moving introspective films of Kubrick, Leone, and Terrence Malick. In Heaven's Gate the story (or arguably abundance of strands that never fully gel as a story) is not slow-moving; it doesn't move at all. There is a feeling of ineptness to this writing; plot points are set up with no pay-offs, conflicts are improperly introduced, and some characters just wander in and out of the movie at random, most notably John Hurt. Supposedly there was to be more to his character, but many of his scenes got canceled as he had to leave to make The Elephant Man. Well, I guess it's better to play a deformed man than be in a deformed film.The movie starts with a 20-minute prologue of a graduation ceremony that is often criticized for being irrelevant to the rest of the film. I actually found this sequence to be well-shot and successfully conveyed a feeling of epic grandeur. Had their been more focus on Joseph Cotton's speech, audiences would have been able to better connect with the scene and see how it connects thematically to the rest of the story. The problem is that Cimino focuses more on this grandeur and spectacle then he does on the content, and this flaw continues throughout the film. My criticism isn't that nothing has happened 20 minutes in; it's the fact that by the 90 minute mark you still don't know what the hell the movie's about.Stuff just happens with no feeling of flow or narrative. Jim and Ella swim together. People play an early baseball game. Someone gets killed. Jeff Bridges shows up to play a hollow shell of a character. 52 takes were spent on a scene where Jim cracks a whip in bed. Was it worth it? Well, let's just say that were it not for that anecdote, I would have no memory that that scene is in the movie. One of the most famous scenes is the skating rink sequence with the fiddler. I had seen this scene before on YouTube and found it to be very lovely as a stand-alone scene. Ironically, when I actually saw it in its proper context in the film, it no longer seemed magical. The scene is tragically undermined by the excess of nothing that precedes it.Here's an example of dysfunctional storytelling it is revealed (via a very dull boardroom scene) that the cattlemen association have a list of 125 settlers they plan to have killed. Okay, so this is supposed to be our story's conflict. It is then 40 minutes later before this is EVER brought up again, and when it is, there is no new development; it is simply mentioned in passing dialog. It's like the story was an afterthought that got buried. It also doesn't help that the settlers are stock characters who are never developed.The other plot line in the movie is a love triangle between the three leads. This has two problems 1) It never really meshes with the cattlemen vs. settler plot line and feels like a different movie, and 2) It's already in full swing when the story begins. I would have preferred to have been told a story about the development of this triangle rather than just observing it already happening.Another anecdote I've heard is that during the intermission at the premiere, Cimino noticed the audience was subdued and was told Because they hate the movie. I think I can understand that audience quite well. When I reached the intermission, I did not hate the movie, I just felt empty by the vapid nothingness being put on screen (it also doesn't help that the intermission happens at a completely arbitrary moment with no sense of rising action).The irony is that there's nothing really bad about the movie aside from its screenplay. The music is great, the sets are great, that actors do a good job with the scarce material they have, and the cinematography can at times be some of the best ever put on film. Yet somehow this makes the movie EVEN WORSE. The fact that it looks so pretty only adds to the feeling of disconnect; it makes the movie seem out of touch with reality. The final battle is fairly exciting, and I will admit that the movie has a shining moment of greatness when a character is surprisingly killed in a heartfelt scene. Had the movie ended right there, it would actually have been a strong ending. But no, we're treated to badly-conceived epilogue on a yacht. As with the prologue, I see what Cimino was trying to do, but it fails because of lack of character development. Again, Jim's personal story never meshed with the story of the rest of the film.Heaven's Gate is certainly not the worst movie I've ever seen (that honor will always go to Problem Child 2) but it is the messiest in terms of storytelling. I know there are many who defend it and call it a misunderstood masterpiece. I always respect everyone's opinion and have tried to read these arguments, but I feel like they are just playing a game of pretend. Each fan brings their own interpretation to the nothingness on screen. For me, Heaven's Gate did something far worse than bore me or fail to entertain; it left me feeling angry.

The subject matter was interesting enough. Teena Brandon (Brandon) was a transgendered female who identified as a male and lived as a male in Lincoln, Nebraska. After some difficulties with the law, Brandon finds himself hooked up with a questionable group of friends in a small town in the state. The friends include a couple of ex-cons, and several young women, one of whom - Lana - Brandon becomes involved with even though she doesn't know about Brandon's sexuality.This is based on a true story. I didn't really know the details of Brandon's life, and so had no idea what the movie was going to contain or what was going to happen. For a good part of its runtime, I was wondering what made the story so significant. It was interesting to see how Brandon approached the question of sexuality and how Brandon lived. It was obvious that Brandon was someone who came from a troubled background; obvious also that Brandon's sexual identity had resulted in rejection from Brandon's own family. Brandon had a troubled life, and in some ways the connection with Lana made sense. She also had a troubled and unhappy home life, and the two did seem able to support one another through their respective difficulties. Even though Lana didn't know about Brandon's sexuality, her acceptance of Brandon as a male must have been a source of some comfort and relief. Hilary Swank won an Oscar for her portrayal of Brandon, and Chloe Sevigny was nominated for her portrayal of Lana. I thought both were excellent in this. The movie eventually becomes quite dark and disturbing, moving from being an account of Brandon's life to the events that led up to Brandon's death. Unable to hide the secret forever, Brandon's identity is discovered by the thugs John and Tom (Peter Saarsgard and Brendan Sexton III). This becomes quite ugly, and for perhaps the first time in the movie Brandon (who had come across up to this point as a bit manipulative, lying about all manner of things and not just sexuality) becomes a real object of sympathy. John and Tom humiliate Brandon by forcibly removing Brandon's pants and forcing Lana to look to prove to her that Brandon has female parts. Brandon is then driven to an isolated area by John and Tom and brutally assaulted and raped. Eventually, out of fear that Brandon would report them for what they did, Brandon is murdered by John and Tom.Based on what I've read about Brandon\/Teena and about the case since seeing this, I'd have to commend those responsible for sticking pretty close to the details of what happened. There doesn't seem to have been a lot of dramatic licence taken. I also appreciated that although in the end one has to be appalled by what happened to Brandon the movie didn't come across as a tribute to Brandon. Brandon was shown with both strengths and weaknesses. Brandon's life was hard - and some of the things that made it hard were the result of Brandon's own choices. Brandon's life wasn't soft-soaped in any way to create a hero. This was a life depicted with warts and all. Having said that, it should be mentioned that the real Lana threatened to take legal action over the use of her real name without permission and because of what she claimed was an inaccurate depiction of her life.For a while if you don't know the background of the true events that inspired it, you do wonder exactly where this is going, what point is trying to be made or what lesson is trying to be taught. Still, it's very interesting from beginning to end, and turns out to be both powerful and disturbing. All in all, it's an excellent piece of work.

Even though Lana didn't know about Brandon's sexuality, her acceptance of Brandon as a male must have been a source of some comfort and relief. Hilary Swank won an Oscar for her portrayal of Brandon, and Chloe Sevigny was nominated for her portrayal of Lana. I thought both were excellent in this. The movie eventually becomes quite dark and disturbing, moving from being an account of Brandon's life to the events that led up to Brandon's death. Unable to hide the secret forever, Brandon's identity is discovered by the thugs John and Tom (Peter Saarsgard and Brendan Sexton III). This becomes quite ugly, and for perhaps the first time in the movie Brandon (who had come across up to this point as a bit manipulative, lying about all manner of things and not just sexuality) becomes a real object of sympathy. John and Tom humiliate Brandon by forcibly removing Brandon's pants and forcing Lana to look to prove to her that Brandon has female parts. Brandon is then driven to an isolated area by John and Tom and brutally assaulted and raped. Eventually, out of fear that Brandon would report them for what they did, Brandon is murdered by John and Tom.Based on what I've read about Brandon\/Teena and about the case since seeing this, I'd have to commend those responsible for sticking pretty close to the details of what happened. There doesn't seem to have been a lot of dramatic licence taken. I also appreciated that although in the end one has to be appalled by what happened to Brandon the movie didn't come across as a tribute to Brandon. Brandon was shown with both strengths and weaknesses. Brandon's life was hard - and some of the things that made it hard were the result of Brandon's own choices. Brandon's life wasn't soft-soaped in any way to create a hero. This was a life depicted with warts and all. Having said that, it should be mentioned that the real Lana threatened to take legal action over the use of her real name without permission and because of what she claimed was an inaccurate depiction of her life.For a while if you don't know the background of the true events that inspired it, you do wonder exactly where this is going, what point is trying to be made or what lesson is trying to be taught.

The subject matter was interesting enough. Teena Brandon (Brandon) was a transgendered female who identified as a male and lived as a male in Lincoln, Nebraska. After some difficulties with the law, Brandon finds himself hooked up with a questionable group of friends in a small town in the state. The friends include a couple of ex-cons, and several young women, one of whom - Lana - Brandon becomes involved with even though she doesn't know about Brandon's sexuality.This is based on a true story. I didn't really know the details of Brandon's life, and so had no idea what the movie was going to contain or what was going to happen. For a good part of its runtime, I was wondering what made the story so significant. It was interesting to see how Brandon approached the question of sexuality and how Brandon lived. It was obvious that Brandon was someone who came from a troubled background; obvious also that Brandon's sexual identity had resulted in rejection from Brandon's own family. Brandon had a troubled life, and in some ways the connection with Lana made sense.

It will suffice to say, it's undoubtedly one of Woody Allen's masterpieces. Allen plays a twice-divorced New Yorker, Isaac, on the brink of a mid-life crisis he is struggling with his career and is dating a 17 year old girl (Mariel Hemingway). His best friend (Michael Murphy) is having an affair with culturally savvy Mary (Diane Keaton), the clash of classes so obviously seen. Despite the differences, Isaac falls for Mary and Mary falls for Isaac, quite the relational web for these characters, but so much more deep than one would imagine. Manhattan evokes some sort of lost romanticism, the most effective use of idealized post- modern charm. It's both relaxing and utterly thrilling, with Allen's usual notions of his passion and love for New York, shown brilliantly in Gordon Willis' black and white cinematography, which manages to highlight the beauty of New York, wrapped up in the gritty industrialism. Every nuance of the film has New York written all over it. From the iconic places and iconic music, it creates some iconic visuals. It is Allen's adoration of the city and for cinema itself that make it an intimate spectacle on the backdrop of the epic concrete jungle.The relationships and characters are as lively and complex as the gorgeous city around them. The way Manhattan never gives easy answers for it's characters is one of the strengths of this film, and certainly one of the biggest weaknesses of the modern romantic comedy. He writes these characters as real human beings, with depth beyond adolescent themes and more into his common exploration of psychology and sexual desire, among other things. He really knows how to bring out the best in his cast. There is not a single performance that could be considered less than authentically magnificent, and Allen's top-notch writing certainly helps. Diane Keaton gives another effortless performance, and she fits this film so perfectly independent, confused, but ultimately bearing psychological American complexities that drive her character to choose what she chooses in the end. Mariel Hemingway is the most subtle, perhaps because of the ingenuity of her character, but always acting so true to form, as if she is living the life of her character and her transitions from bright-eyed-young-girl to bright- eyed-young-woman are done brilliantly. Of course Woody Allen is especially earnest, and throw in Meryl Streep and you've got one of the best casts ever assembled.

So interesting in fact I had to see it twice before I could make my mind up about it. I was born well after this film came out, and even after the fall of the USSR. However, history quite interests me and I do research on the films I see. Dr. Strangelove still polarizes me.From the mind of the legendary Stanley Kubrick, Strangelove is about war. Nuclear war. And somehow, this black comedy made it humorous. I don't want to say funny, because I didn't quite laugh out loud, but the characters are quirky, the plot over the top, and one famous scene demands a chuckle.Strangelove didn't leave an immediate impression on me. I thought the jokes weren't funny enough and the first half hour was slow, which is a big chunk of this 100 minute movie. But in the days and weeks after, I found myself referring to things as the 'Big Board' and used a crazed German accent more. What Strangelove has is staying power.This is due to the excellent performances. Sellers is a great anchor as the President, delivering some good lines. He does the job of Mandrake adequately, but his scenes weren't the best. General Ripper, while being quite nuts, would've lit up those scenes in the air force base with a little insanity. But the character of Strangelove is the best. His voice, hair, glasses and glove (evil!) are hilarious. His last scene, where his body starts to lose control, is great and his final line is priceless. Other winners are George Scott, and the anxious General Turgidson, Peter Bull's spot-on Russian stereotype, and Slim Picken's Major Kong.Unfortunately, Strangelove simply isn't as shocking or funny as another satire of conflict The Great Dictator (If you read my review, it's golden). That film, 20 years older, stands above Strangelove in many ways, especially the humour. Strangelove is too slow-burning in comparison.And then there's the ending. While I understand the plot's conclusion, I'm unclear of the message being told to a generation who lived in paranoia. If it's that nukes will kill us all, why was this a comedy with such a left-field ending? It's not a bad ending, just a fuzzy one.I liked Strangelove more and more after I saw it. If you stick with it, it gets better later into the film. It may have had a large effect on people when it came out, but it hasn't aged too well. 8.4\/10*Edit* Now, 8 months after the second viewing I can say I've seen Strangelove 3 times, and now I have Kubrick's earlier repertoire under my belt as well. I can summarize my new thoughts of the film.There's no denying that this is a great film. The script is legendary, the performances adequately silly, and there's just a very light atmosphere for a dark subject. But Strangelove is now... irrelevant. The future cannot be kind to it as it is very 'in the moment'. I envy anyone who saw this in theaters, but today it just doesn't have the same effect. It's not a universal theme that can be applied elsewhere, the film is very specific. And that is why, while great, Strangelove can't last. Still an 8.4.

Everyone rants and raves about how amazing it is. But I sat down to watch it again and liked it even less than when I was a kid (this is coming from someone who likes other Disney films more now, at age 20, than as a kid). Why? I honestly don't understand why everyone says this is Disney's best work.I admit, for its day and even for now, the animation is superb. I only saw one or two flaws in the whole movie and they were pretty easy to miss. But as nice as it all looks, the continuity was pretty bad. There's a scene in which Jiminy Cricket hangs his coat and hat on a peg. Next shot, it's gone. We see Pinocchio with the hat and coat a few seconds later but they literally disappear off the peg. There's also a scene in which one of the characters is singing and his mouth literally doesn't move at all. And it's pretty dang obvious.The music is good too. I don't have any complaints about it. It has solid music that's cute and charming and it's all good. So that's one thing the movie did well.But the story... Hoo boy. First off, the story is a confusing mess. There's no real storyline weaving throughout unless you count Pinocchio's attempts to be a real boy. How does this lead him all over the place? It doesn't. The story of his attempts to be a real boy are scrapped during scenes that don't make a whole lot of sense to begin with. It is never explained how and why bad boys become donkeys (unless you count Jiminy Cricket's line about how they're acting like jackasses). It is also never explained what happens to them when they become donkeys. Are they sold somewhere? Who's the guy rounding them up? And wouldn't parents get worried if a huge crowd of little boys randomly disappear periodically? Why are the talking ones discarded? They're still donkeys. They can still be sold. I have so many questions about that scene. It just doesn't make ANY sense.And then they return to the house to find that Pinocchio's father has been swallowed by a whale while he was looking for Pinocchio. Okay so the father was so stupid he actually went into the water looking for his wooden son or the whale jumped out of the water and swallowed him. Also, who left the note for them? Someone who saw it? How did they get the birds to deliver it? Was it Giselle from Enchanted sending her doves with a message again? And then there's the whale. So whales are vicious carnivores now? I admit I could be wrong but that whale looked like one of the ones known for only eating krill. And then there was the fire. So they make the whale sneeze by burning it from the inside? How does that make sense?? Smoke doesn't make you sneeze.And those are just a few of my examples of why this movie is far from the best Disney movie ever made. It's not bad but it's certainly not good. It's adequate. Entertaining but nothing special. It looks nice but there really isn't anything beneath the surface. So yeah I'd recommend it to Disney fans. But I think I'll leave the title of best animated movie to The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (if only because it features the introduction of characters that are now more popular than Mickey Mouse and friends... and it's my favorite too). Pinocchio is just another movie on the list of Disney animated features. Nothing more, nothing less.

There's no real storyline weaving throughout unless you count Pinocchio's attempts to be a real boy. How does this lead him all over the place? It doesn't. The story of his attempts to be a real boy are scrapped during scenes that don't make a whole lot of sense to begin with. It is never explained how and why bad boys become donkeys (unless you count Jiminy Cricket's line about how they're acting like jackasses). It is also never explained what happens to them when they become donkeys. Are they sold somewhere? Who's the guy rounding them up? And wouldn't parents get worried if a huge crowd of little boys randomly disappear periodically? Why are the talking ones discarded? They're still donkeys. They can still be sold. I have so many questions about that scene. It just doesn't make ANY sense.And then they return to the house to find that Pinocchio's father has been swallowed by a whale while he was looking for Pinocchio. Okay so the father was so stupid he actually went into the water looking for his wooden son or the whale jumped out of the water and swallowed him. Also, who left the note for them? Someone who saw it? How did they get the birds to deliver it? Was it Giselle from Enchanted sending her doves with a message again? And then there's the whale. So whales are vicious carnivores now? I admit I could be wrong but that whale looked like one of the ones known for only eating krill. And then there was the fire. So they make the whale sneeze by burning it from the inside? How does that make sense?? Smoke doesn't make you sneeze.And those are just a few of my examples of why this movie is far from the best Disney movie ever made. It's not bad but it's certainly not good. It's adequate. Entertaining but nothing special. It looks nice but there really isn't anything beneath the surface. So yeah I'd recommend it to Disney fans. But I think I'll leave the title of best animated movie to The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (if only because it features the introduction of characters that are now more popular than Mickey Mouse and friends... and it's my favorite too).

Everyone rants and raves about how amazing it is. But I sat down to watch it again and liked it even less than when I was a kid (this is coming from someone who likes other Disney films more now, at age 20, than as a kid). Why? I honestly don't understand why everyone says this is Disney's best work.I admit, for its day and even for now, the animation is superb. I only saw one or two flaws in the whole movie and they were pretty easy to miss. But as nice as it all looks, the continuity was pretty bad. There's a scene in which Jiminy Cricket hangs his coat and hat on a peg. Next shot, it's gone. We see Pinocchio with the hat and coat a few seconds later but they literally disappear off the peg.

Not only is it a blatant rip-off of John Carpenter's Halloween (I think the script writer himself admitted that he wrote this to cash in on the Michael Myer's craze) it also has aged very badly and is extremely dull and unbelievably boring. It doesn't come anywhere near to matching the knuckle-biting, chair-gripping suspense of Halloween, and nor does it have anything on the crazy, nihilistic atmosphere as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. And also, it lacks the style and horror of the later film from Wes Craven, A Nightmare on Elm Street. I could go on, but I won't. What I'm trying to say here is that Friday the 13th has much a right as being ranked up there with them horror greats as Gremlins does. Directed by Sean Cunningham who had before this helped produce Wes Craven's shocking debut The Last House on the Left. Well I thought that after having experience working on such a nasty and violent film like that, that Cunningham would have done the same with his own slasher. But instead what he did was kept the violence at a minimum and just spent the whole film watching the teenagers from the killers perspective as it roams around the forest stalking them. Nice idea Sean, but it had been done already in Halloween no more than three years before you! What is very strange is that there are some nice gory and violent killings at the beginning, thanks to some smart editing, but as the film progresses, it's as if they ran out of steam because the murders get less and less violent. I think everyone knows the plot at this stage. Camp Crystal Lake has been closed for years, but it's having a re-opening this summer and the camps counsellors are working hard to have the place in good condition for the summer months. They've been warned by the town loony from down the road that they are all going to die because the place is cursed. But as usual, the guy is crazy, so why heath his warning? What these teenagers weren't told is that back in the late 50's, a young boy named Jason drowned in the lake because the counsellors were too busy having sex to notice and help him. The events in the film take place over one night, as an unknown assailant stalks and murders each one of the counsellors...Well, I don't want to spoil this movie so I'll refrain from saying what it is I want to say, the thing that disappointed me the most - and I think anyone who has the seen the film will know what I'm talking about as it has something to do with the killer... or for lack of a better phrase, who 'isn't' doing the killings. I've probably said too much there, but ah well. When poor little Victor Miller wrote the script for this film, he had no idea that Cunningham would get carried away and turn the film into the mad franchise that it is today - it's even bigger than the Freddy Krueger and Halloween franchises with a total of nine sequels (For a while there I thought that Saw was gunning to either match or over-jump this record) a cross-over with Freddy in 2003, and of course, an inevitable remake. What may interest some people is that Friday the 13th has a very young Kevin Bacon from Footloose in one of his very first roles. The acting is atrocious, but I don't blame the actors for their lousy dialogue and whatever, because the script was just horrendous from Miller. I actually can't believe that this is considered a classic today. It shows no merit, no innovation, and most of all, it shows no 'talent' whatsoever and this could have easily just passed off as some amateur's low-grade feature.

Not only is it a blatant rip-off of John Carpenter's Halloween (I think the script writer himself admitted that he wrote this to cash in on the Michael Myer's craze) it also has aged very badly and is extremely dull and unbelievably boring. It doesn't come anywhere near to matching the knuckle-biting, chair-gripping suspense of Halloween, and nor does it have anything on the crazy, nihilistic atmosphere as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. And also, it lacks the style and horror of the later film from Wes Craven, A Nightmare on Elm Street. I could go on, but I won't. What I'm trying to say here is that Friday the 13th has much a right as being ranked up there with them horror greats as Gremlins does. Directed by Sean Cunningham who had before this helped produce Wes Craven's shocking debut The Last House on the Left. Well I thought that after having experience working on such a nasty and violent film like that, that Cunningham would have done the same with his own slasher. But instead what he did was kept the violence at a minimum and just spent the whole film watching the teenagers from the killers perspective as it roams around the forest stalking them. Nice idea Sean, but it had been done already in Halloween no more than three years before you! What is very strange is that there are some nice gory and violent killings at the beginning, thanks to some smart editing, but as the film progresses, it's as if they ran out of steam because the murders get less and less violent. I think everyone knows the plot at this stage. Camp Crystal Lake has been closed for years, but it's having a re-opening this summer and the camps counsellors are working hard to have the place in good condition for the summer months. They've been warned by the town loony from down the road that they are all going to die because the place is cursed. But as usual, the guy is crazy, so why heath his warning? What these teenagers weren't told is that back in the late 50's, a young boy named Jason drowned in the lake because the counsellors were too busy having sex to notice and help him. The events in the film take place over one night, as an unknown assailant stalks and murders each one of the counsellors...Well, I don't want to spoil this movie so I'll refrain from saying what it is I want to say, the thing that disappointed me the most - and I think anyone who has the seen the film will know what I'm talking about as it has something to do with the killer... or for lack of a better phrase, who 'isn't' doing the killings. I've probably said too much there, but ah well. When poor little Victor Miller wrote the script for this film, he had no idea that Cunningham would get carried away and turn the film into the mad franchise that it is today - it's even bigger than the Freddy Krueger and Halloween franchises with a total of nine sequels (For a while there I thought that Saw was gunning to either match or over-jump this record) a cross-over with Freddy in 2003, and of course, an inevitable remake. What may interest some people is that Friday the 13th has a very young Kevin Bacon from Footloose in one of his very first roles. The acting is atrocious, but I don't blame the actors for their lousy dialogue and whatever, because the script was just horrendous from Miller. I actually can't believe that this is considered a classic today. It shows no merit, no innovation, and most of all, it shows no 'talent' whatsoever and this could have easily just passed off as some amateur's low-grade feature.

From the casting, to the fight scenes, to the music, there is nothing that I would have done any differently.There is just enough comedy, each turtle is given their own unique, identifiable, and believable personality, and the story is fast paced and gripping.Jim Henson's people did a stunning job on the Turtles themselves, and the Shredder looks even better than he did in the Cartoons.Speaking of the cartoon, almost all of the campy stuff has been eradicated from the film. The film really pays homage to the original comics by introducing Casey Jones, dealing with Raphael's anger, and resisting the urge to insert lame characters like Krang made famous by the cartoon.The whole movie is shot in a very brooding and gritty manor.

It's easy to watch and get sucked into the aura of it all.It's a kind of Irish The Godfather and if the tone has changed from sunny weddings to rainy wakes, it has all the elements of the mobster family in time of crisis. Playing Brando is Paul Newman, with a shade of a brogue. And the wayward son (Daniel Craig) is at odds with the adopted son (Tom Hanks), as murders beget murders and one side of the family wipes out the other side. As usual, blood is thicker than water, so Hanks is soon on the run, taking his young son with him. The story is told, with some voice-over, from the point of view of this boy.As much as it's engrossing, it's also slow. The stereotypes are too plainly played out as stereotypes, with an Irish angle. Eventually a real Italian mobster is instrumental in a few more killings, an Al Capone type played by Stanley Tucci. It all works, it's all fine, but it isn't The Godfather in the epic or dramatic ways it really seems to intend.Hanks is terrific, however. He plays his part as a hired killer with unwavering coolness, but with a feeling he is trapped by his life. He does what he has to but with no pleasure, no bloodthirst. In a way, with the filming (sets, light, camera) and Hanks, the movie is a kind of must see. Then there is the somewhat over the top sensationalism of a late entry into the plot, a crime photographer played by Jude Law, who can play creepy rather well for such a pretty boy. His role is completely out of place in a way, and if the movie had encouraged this kind of invention all along it might have been an original worth its salt.

As usual, blood is thicker than water, so Hanks is soon on the run, taking his young son with him. The story is told, with some voice-over, from the point of view of this boy.As much as it's engrossing, it's also slow. The stereotypes are too plainly played out as stereotypes, with an Irish angle. Eventually a real Italian mobster is instrumental in a few more killings, an Al Capone type played by Stanley Tucci. It all works, it's all fine, but it isn't The Godfather in the epic or dramatic ways it really seems to intend.Hanks is terrific, however. He plays his part as a hired killer with unwavering coolness, but with a feeling he is trapped by his life. He does what he has to but with no pleasure, no bloodthirst. In a way, with the filming (sets, light, camera) and Hanks, the movie is a kind of must see. Then there is the somewhat over the top sensationalism of a late entry into the plot, a crime photographer played by Jude Law, who can play creepy rather well for such a pretty boy. His role is completely out of place in a way, and if the movie had encouraged this kind of invention all along it might have been an original worth its salt.
