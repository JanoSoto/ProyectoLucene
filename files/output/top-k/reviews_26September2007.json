[{"date":"26 September 2007","score":"","review":" Michael (Hugh Grant) is an art dealer\/auctioneer for a Manhattan firm called Cromwell's, a knock-off of Sotheby's. He has a good eye for art and is also a great auction man, as he can liven up any sale with his dry jokes. Good fortune has also smiled on him in the romance department. He has been dating lovely Gina (Jeanne Tripplehorn) for three months and is ready to pop the question. Yet, when he proposes over dinner, Gina starts crying and bolts out of the restaurant. It is not the response Michael expected. But, he learns soon enough about Gina's misgivings. Although she is a public school teacher, Gina is also the daughter of a mobster (James Caan) and the niece of the godfather of the crime family. She fears that Michael will be compromised and drawn into a life of crime if he marries her. Michael insists that he has a strong backbone and will never break the law. Yet, the day after Gina puts on her engagement ring, an ugly and ridiculous painting by her cousin shows up at Cromwell's for the auction. To Michael's surprise, it sells. But, it is part of a money laundering scheme and the FBI shows up at Michael's office. Soon after, Michael's resolve is again compromised....and again and again. Will Michael and Gina find a way out of the mob existence? This film could have been dismissed as a meager mob comedy if not for the talents of Grant. He turns the film into a true winner with his deft touch for humor. Just watch him try to dump a dead body in a trash bag but tell the neighbor lady that he is merely getting rid of all the foods with sugar in his refrigerator, having been recently diagnosed as a diabetic. What fun! Watching him attempt to talk like a Brooklyn native is quite a stitch, too. Caan, Tripplehorn and, especially James Fox as the auction house owner, also play their parts well. The production values are high, as the film sports nice costumes, good settings, and zestful scene changes. No, it is not the funniest mob comedy of all time, and definitely not in the same category as Married to the Mob. Yet, if you love romantic comedies with a twist and\/or you adore Grant, you will find this film very worthwhile. Make a date with Mickey soon, very soon.

A highly entertaining blockbuster. I love the summer. It's the time every year or so, that we could sit back, relax and try to get back to your lazy self. You can go outside, fly kites, ride your bike across the countryside, go to the beach, stay at home and watch television, or go to the theaters and catch the latest in summer blockbuster releases. It was way back in the 1990's that these blockbuster flourished. It was almost every year or so, we get a film that tried to top the other. It was the busiest time for Hollywood.I wasn't much frequent on watching movies on the big screen back then, and only manage to watch these movies on video. I watched INDEPENDENCE DAY many years later, having missed it on both its exact release date and decade. I saw it on a post-summer night, just a few weeks after summer vacation just ended. Upon watching, I found myself enjoying everything about it. Rating it on a summer movie meter, it's terrific entertainment. The definitive summer blockbuster.INDEPENDENCE DAY has no moment to spare. It starts out quickly with the sight of a gigantic alien spaceship hovering over the craters of the moon, heading towards the Earth. The film has the usual news on Earth, like all invasion flicks, having the news spread, starting from a small organization investigating extraterrestrial activity, then to the military, who then phone calls The White House, giving it full news to President Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman), who obviously remembers Michael Douglas' president performance in THE American PRESIDENT (but I didn't say lampoon), who stares in a moment of shock and disbelief.Before the sight of the alien spaceship hovering above the cities around the world, we first get a glimpse of the many characters in the film. First, there's computer engineer David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum, in an excellent performance), playing chess with father Julius Levinson(Judd Hirsh) at Central Park. David is divorced from his wife (Margaret Colin), who happens to be the President's Chief-of-staff (see the connections). Then it switches to Kansas, where the focus is a small family. The father, Russell Casse (Randy Quaid), a crop-dust farmer, believes he's kidnapped by aliens and is willing for payback, much to the dismay of his teenage kids. We also get introduced to a soldier (Will Smith), who both longs to return to NASA and reach for the stars (literally), and to propose to his girlfriend Jasmine (Vivica A. Fox).Well, enough of that. It's time we see an invasion, and, boy, did we get one. After the discovery of the invaders plot (using the Earth's satellites to plan an attack), we get a mind-blowing sequence after another at incredible pace. The destruction at the streets of New York are just the first great effects-laden sequences in the film. Lets see, we get a STAR WARS-inspired dogfight between fighter jets and alien spaceships. And we also get a suspenseful sequence of an alien in laboratory (Talk about a close encounter), INDEPENDENCE DAY doesn't fail when it comes to a good visual feast. Admittedly, some of the effects are cheesy, seeing how much CGI has improved over the years, but they still provide an eye-filling experience.INDEPENDENCE DAY runs for a long 145 minutes, but director Roland Emmerich fills it with lots of fun and excitement, it just seems to pass by. Director Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin spares no moments and doesn't stop for a break, giving the film a roaring pace without a dull moment that can't be interesting. The photography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub gives the film a good look, while composer David Arnold serenades the film with a rollicking and patriotic score.Forget its stereotype problems, INDEPENDENCE DAY is terrific summer entertainment that never fails to have me entertained.Rating ***** out of 5.

The film successfully walks the tightrope between schlock-horror-comedy, young adult romance-adventure, family movie, and talent showcase. And there is no gore! Like most of Schumaker's work, Lost Boys is very Hollywood. Unlike most of the subsequent vampire films, however, Lost Boys very rarely takes itself seriously. Though most of the film's humor is pretty dated, it essentially hybridizes Ferris Bueller's day off and Interview with the Vampire.Corey Haim and Jason Patric are two brothers who have just moved with their mom (Rachel Weist) to a new boardwalk town. Michael (Patric) wastes no time getting himself mixes up with a mysterious beauty (Jami Gertz) and her hive of vampires who literally hang out in a ruined hotel nestled within the San Andreas Fault. Meanwhile, his brother (Haim) has met a pair of ca. 9-year-old wannabe vampire slayers. Kiefer Sutherland and Jason Patric give particularly strong performances and really drive most of this film.The cinematography is very good and quite consistent with the film's tongue-in-cheek approach. The script is economical and appropriate, though a bit dated. The editing is fine. Schumaker is Schumaker, and if your familiar with him, you know what you're going to get in his films - well-paced economical entertainment designed for a big budget which blends Hollywood formulae with big name talent and an at least half-thought-out plot. In other words, Schumaker always at least tries to give a lot of bang for your buck. The formula works here, and, in my opinion, more than it usually does. Unlike most modern gothics, Lost Boys uses special effects and make up very sparingly. It is refreshing to see a horror film without CGI and vats full of cow blood. However, the film is fairly dated, and not all that original (similar in style and story to Return of the Living Dead, among others). Still, it's a better film than it deserves to be,and one of my top-rated from Schumaker.

The swinging London of Carnaby Street was just beginning, but young singles who did not still live at home with parents were still living in ghastly cheap rooms. I must confess that this film coloured my view of Michael Caine for many, many years. He was always Alfie to me - a selfish, callous self-absorbed cad, which does indicate how good his performance was. The British cinema was getting away from noble heroic types winning WWII with stiff upper lips, who always did their duty and behaved like gentlemen. John Mills, Jack Hawkins, and Kenneth More were giving way to Albert Finney, Kenneth Haig, Alfred Lynch and Michael Caine. The 60's spawned dramas about the working class who subsisted in bad housing and dreary jobs. By the time of the film, national service had ended, if it had not, Alfie would have found a way to get a deferment as he had no loyalty to Queen and country, only to himself.While many current viewers may be shocked and disbelieving of Alfie's attitudes, and the women's acceptance of them, that is exactly how it was with many people of that time. The women were raised to put men first, and the men expected nothing less. Jane Asher, as little Annie from Sheffield was exactly the type of girl that my generation were expected to be. Subservient housekeepers doing the washing, ironing and cooking while their man went out with the boys and had fun. A similar film was Billy Liar, although Billy was a fantasist rather than a cad. I really loved the small background touches in this film. The pub where Queenie Watts continued singing with the band throughout the brawl. The gay man protecting his partner from the brawl (this was before gays came out).

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"26 September 2007","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Stanley Kubrick's raw, austere first feature is perhaps best viewed as an extension of his documentary short Day of the Fight, which chronicles the preparation of an on-the-rise boxer and approaches the Bronx with the same subterranean eye for littered streets, bare tenements, and ominously gray mid-day skies. Davy Gordon, the washed-up protagonist of Killer's Kiss, is far from the polished young prizefighter of that earlier film, his fight-day routine consisting of pacing about his ramshackle apartment and stealing gazes at his neighbor, a fetching blonde named Gloria who lustfully reciprocates. She's involved with a jealous hoodlum (Frank Silvera) who runs the dance hall at which she works. When Davy intervenes in a dispute between them, Silvera targets him for a fall.As he would in many of his subsequent features, Kubrick uses genre framework (here, film noir) as a means to explore characters negotiating an irrational environment in which they're both victims and manipulators. Society is only as backward as mankind, so here we have Davy, a man who miscalculates the situation (and realizes he does so) but determines to bull ahead anyway. Tellingly, Kubrick uses a dissolve flashback to clarify the inciting incident (Silvera's assault on Gloria), which Gloria relates to Davy secondhand. The next morning, Gloria tells one more story, also relayed via dissolve, about her ballerina sister's unhealthy attachment to their father (a stunning scene that conveys background information in the most disturbing, expressive way imaginable). These flashbacks cumulatively suggest that (a) Gloria is neither fatale nor innocent, but something much more psychologically elusive; (b) Davy is out of his depth; and (c) Kubrick enjoys toying with the guilt-and-victim archetypes of noir, using them as an instructive link to his worldview.Kubrick was already operating at near-peak technical efficiency despite budget constraints (he also photographed, wrote, and edited the film). The exaggerated sound design paints an oppressive and crude tone. There's a scene in which Davy phones his gym and the sounds of sparring and heavy-bag work emanating from the other line resemble the grinding cacophony of a printing press. Shooting on location often with hand-held cameras, Kubrick finds seemingly spontaneous details that factor significantly in the story as Davy waits outside the club for Gloria to collect her money, two costumed street dancers emerge from off-screen and swipe his scarf, leading to a chase that results in Davy's manager being mistakenly beaten to death by Silvera's goons. Davy's bout, a brief tour de force of editing and camera-work, similarly benefits from the director's workmanlike approach moving beyond the short's detached fascination with boxing as competitive sport, Kubrick thrusts his camera into battle, weaving between flying fists, moving low, always staying dangerously close to the combatants, capturing boxing at its most kinetic. (The only other director I can think of to film boxing this way is Michael Mann, whose Ali-Liston fight almost certainly borrows elements from this scene.) In stark contrast, the climax&#x97;a chase across rooftops filmed via tripod from a restrained distance&#x97;defiantly holds the tension at a remove, the camera placidly surveying and literalizing the world's indifference to this human plight. When Silvera and Davy finally duel in a mannequin factory, the struggle for survival is desperate and pathetic, and the score quiets to emphasize their wheezing and posturing. It's brutal and debased but, as with the sanctioned boxing match, ironically the purest validation of life in a society that swindles and betrays with impunity. Clearly, Kubrick always had a noir kind of sensibility, and on evidence of this and The Killing, he probably could have made this type of film his entire career and still been considered one of the greatest directors of his time. ","genre":null},{"date":"26 September 2007","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Stanley Kubrick's raw, austere first feature is perhaps best viewed as an extension of his documentary short Day of the Fight, which chronicles the preparation of an on-the-rise boxer and approaches the Bronx with the same subterranean eye for littered streets, bare tenements, and ominously gray mid-day skies. Davy Gordon, the washed-up protagonist of Killer's Kiss, is far from the polished young prizefighter of that earlier film, his fight-day routine consisting of pacing about his ramshackle apartment and stealing gazes at his neighbor, a fetching blonde named Gloria who lustfully reciprocates. She's involved with a jealous hoodlum (Frank Silvera) who runs the dance hall at which she works. When Davy intervenes in a dispute between them, Silvera targets him for a fall.As he would in many of his subsequent features, Kubrick uses genre framework (here, film noir) as a means to explore characters negotiating an irrational environment in which they're both victims and manipulators. Society is only as backward as mankind, so here we have Davy, a man who miscalculates the situation (and realizes he does so) but determines to bull ahead anyway. Tellingly, Kubrick uses a dissolve flashback to clarify the inciting incident (Silvera's assault on Gloria), which Gloria relates to Davy secondhand. The next morning, Gloria tells one more story, also relayed via dissolve, about her ballerina sister's unhealthy attachment to their father (a stunning scene that conveys background information in the most disturbing, expressive way imaginable). These flashbacks cumulatively suggest that (a) Gloria is neither fatale nor innocent, but something much more psychologically elusive; (b) Davy is out of his depth; and (c) Kubrick enjoys toying with the guilt-and-victim archetypes of noir, using them as an instructive link to his worldview.Kubrick was already operating at near-peak technical efficiency despite budget constraints (he also photographed, wrote, and edited the film). The exaggerated sound design paints an oppressive and crude tone. There's a scene in which Davy phones his gym and the sounds of sparring and heavy-bag work emanating from the other line resemble the grinding cacophony of a printing press.
