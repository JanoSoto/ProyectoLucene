Unfortunately when we tempt the gods, they come back and kick us you know where. When I see Claude Rains in all his interesting roles, this had to be quite a different one for him.

That cackling taunting as he torments those who can't see him is the stuff of nightmares for small children. The slapstick is fine, but it is a serious story (like the Wolf Man) of a man who can't turn back the clock on his obsessions. We long to know what an invisible man will do given the incredible power that he has harnessed. Like Kevin Bacon in a greatly inferior movie, Hollow Men, he can't resist tormenting people and playing with his power, rather than imagining what it could be used for. Of course, a contemporary take on it would bring the military in on it. If it could be used against our enemies there they would be. However Wells never gets there and this movie never gets there.

I first saw this during it's initial theatrical release as a kid in 1964. (They gave us black and white Beatles Fan Club buttons.) Looking back through a 10 year old's eye's I couldn't wait to see The Beatles in a movie. I had seen them on TV and in magazines but an entire movie about them was going to be a watershed event in the career of the group. Indoctrinated by all the corny teen movies that mostly were made prior to Hard Day's Night you knew that if they were going to be portrayed as conventional teen idols it was going to be a bust but if it was a glimpse into what it was like being a Beatle and the London mod scene of '64 and The Beatles in their irreverent but likable persona with cool clothes and Beatle boots and lots of Beatle's music and The Beatles playing their guitars it was going to be a hit. Well it didn't disappoint. I didn't even expect there to be a story. I just wanted to see the Beatles on the big screen and hear their music. (The theater even had women playing nurses in nursing outfits and stretchers for people who fainted. Cool and campy. I have to give that theater credit for all they did. The first 50 people in got Beatles wigs.) As I grew older this film did not when I would see it on TV. Sure it was dated but it was still fun. Supporting, or in this case actual actors, Norman Rossington as Norm and Victor Spinetti as the TV Director along with Wiford Brambell as Paul's clean grandfather and John Junkin as Jake gave the movie a legitimate cast to cohesively hold it together and it worked well but heck, The Beatles were good on their own first time out. George Harrison's future wife, fashion model Pattie Boyd is one of the girls in the train car with the band (Her only line is prisonors) and even future rock and pop star Phil Collins is in a scene as a teen fan. Director Richard Lester should have been at least nominated for an Academy Award as Best Director. Alun Owen did get a nomination for Best Screenplay in the only film he ever did. George Martin also received an Academy Award nomination for Scoring of Music Adaptation. Any of The Beatles songs in this film should have been nominated for Best Original Song but they weren't. Gilbert Taylor was the cinematographer for this film. He had just come off doing the cinematography for the film Dr. Strangelove. John Jympson who had just come off editing the film Zulu was the editor. This film does a wonderful job of capturing the era of mid 1960's London and Beatlemania on film in black and white. Their next film Help, also directed by Lester tried to be too James Bondish and although good was largely silly and didn't come close to HDN.

The time is the year between November, 1951 and November, 1952 and the place is Anarene, Texas, a small town in north central Texas. The screenplay was written by Larry McMurtry, in collaboration with director Bogdanovich, based on McMurtry's novel of the same name. Anarene is just south of Archer City, McMurtry's home town where the movie was filmed. McMurtry knows whereof he speaks, the movie has the feeling of total authenticity.The story centers around two best friends, Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane (Jeff Bridges), as they pass from being high school seniors into adult life. Given their backgrounds, coming from broken homes and living in boarding houses, there is little idea that they will go to college. The movie details how the two handle this pivotal and bewildering time from being on the high school football team one year to being on their own without much of a safety net the next. In a wider context the movie is about larger transitions from youth to adulthood for the young people, from a frustrated and bored middle age to an even less promising future for the older folks, and from a town with some social cohesiveness to a town dealing with the isolating effects of a bankrupt economy and the advent of television. The rather bleak prospects that Sonny and Duane face parallel the prospects of the town. You are made to think about transitions in your own life.The movie is populated with many finely drawn characters, all acted with supreme skill. There is not a false note struck in the entire movie. By the end we know the characters so well that they seem real. Jeff Bridges was nominated for an Oscar, and I don't understand why Timothy Bottoms was not nominated as well, since his performance is of equal quality. Bottoms plays Sonny with such genuine good-natured charm and honest sincerity that it is hard to believe he is acting. And Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman both won well-deserved Oscars. Kudos all round to the entire cast. The movie is beautifully filmed in black and white befitting the stark settings and story, and the time period. It is filmed as if it were made in the period portrayed.If you have ever lived in a small town or if you grew up in the American heartland in the 1950s, this movie will evoke overwhelming nostalgia. But the story is so powerfully told that I think that for everyone it will evoke nostalgia for a time and place, even for that which they may never have known.The town, as well as the movie, is held together by Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson) who owns the movie theater, the café, and the pool hall. In fact he owns just about everything there is to do in Anarene, except for watching the hapless Anarene High football team ... and sex. It is no wonder then that sex, in its many faceted varieties, plays a big role in this town, and in this movie.There are so many wonderful and memorable scenes that it would simply require a small volume to recount them. One scene that grabbed me was when Sam and Sonny are at a lake outside of town, ostensibly fishing, and Sam reminiscences about old times, about when he came to the lake twenty years earlier with a lover. Sam makes the comment, You wouldn't believe how this land has changed. The camera pans the surroundings and it is hard to see how this area could have changed much in the last thousand years, but Sam is clearly attuned to the subtle changes, since memories were impressed on him in a time of strong emotion. We all have clear memories from when and where we have been happy, even if it is a small lake in a desolate flat land. And Sam's specific comment can be taken to apply more generally to the basic theme of the movie. This incredible scene ends with Sam's saying, Being a decrepit old bag of bones, that's what's ridiculous, and anyone who is not close to tears at that point will never truly appreciate the beauty of this movie.Seemingly this movie should be depressing, but the effect is more of a melancholic look into the lives of ordinary people who are just trying to play the hands they have been dealt in life.It wasn't until the movie was over and I was reading the credits that I realized how cleverly the music had been woven into the film. All of the music is from the time period and is a part of the action and not background music. It is played on home radios, car radios, truck radios, 45 rpm players, jukeboxes, and at a community Christmas dance. The Hank Williams song, heard on the radio in Sonny's old truck in the opening scene, Why Don't You Love Me Like You Used to Do? sets the tone for the music as well as the movie. There are great songs taken from over a dozen country and western classics from the era. Ruth (Cloris Leachman) is listening to Johnny Standley's quirky, It's in the Book, (a unique and strangely satirical offering to be popular at any time, let alone reach the pop charts and sell a million records in 1952) during the final scene between her and Sonny.Why is this movie so special? That's kind of like asking why one likes a certain piece of music or a painting. Everything comes together here in one of those magic moments - the acting, the filming, the story, the music, the editing - to create a simply-told and remarkably affecting work of art.

This incredible scene ends with Sam's saying, Being a decrepit old bag of bones, that's what's ridiculous, and anyone who is not close to tears at that point will never truly appreciate the beauty of this movie.Seemingly this movie should be depressing, but the effect is more of a melancholic look into the lives of ordinary people who are just trying to play the hands they have been dealt in life.It wasn't until the movie was over and I was reading the credits that I realized how cleverly the music had been woven into the film. All of the music is from the time period and is a part of the action and not background music. It is played on home radios, car radios, truck radios, 45 rpm players, jukeboxes, and at a community Christmas dance. The Hank Williams song, heard on the radio in Sonny's old truck in the opening scene, Why Don't You Love Me Like You Used to Do? sets the tone for the music as well as the movie. There are great songs taken from over a dozen country and western classics from the era. Ruth (Cloris Leachman) is listening to Johnny Standley's quirky, It's in the Book, (a unique and strangely satirical offering to be popular at any time, let alone reach the pop charts and sell a million records in 1952) during the final scene between her and Sonny.Why is this movie so special? That's kind of like asking why one likes a certain piece of music or a painting. Everything comes together here in one of those magic moments - the acting, the filming, the story, the music, the editing - to create a simply-told and remarkably affecting work of art.

Only here we have gang members while in NOTLD there are zombies. Here the gang members try to invade a police precinct in a Los Angeles ghetto, while in the other film the zombies try to invade a rural farmhouse. Unfortunately, the zombies in that film are far more believable than the street thugs in this film -- and so is everything else.Personally, I think this film is an insult to street gangs. In real life, they are not this stupid, evil or violent and they sure as hell have a lot more personality in real life than they do here (so do the zombies in NOTLD). If I were in a street gang, I would be complaining to someone (perhaps the Anti-Defamation League) that this film unfairly smears street gangs as being racially integrated Goldilocks killers. And the gang members here look more like a pastiche of the Symbionese Liberation Army, the Black Panthers and Che Guevara look-alikes than the Crips or the Bloods. They look like they should be quoting Trotsky and Mao and singing and dancing to the music of Hair and Pippen as they attack the precinct (perhaps I am being unfair toward the thug fashion of a different era, but I don't remember street gangs looking much like the guys in the 1970s except in low-budget movies; maybe I should do a Google image search).But the real problem with this film is that it is not exciting. It's just poorly directed, perhaps because of what must have been a minuscule budget. The action is slow and predictable, the direction is poor and over-staged, and the story is laughably contrived (interesting how there is a power-outage just as the gang members attack). Some of the characters could have been interesting, but ... they aren't. They just have forced, annoying one-liners. No characterization -- just actors speaking lines. Some of the actors are pretty good, while others are really bad. Also, the muscial score (if one could call it that) is terrible. It sounds like 12 year old kid doodling on a synthesizer. John Carpenter went on to direct some very good genre-thrillers later on (especially, of course, HALLOWEEN and THE THING), so I'm guessing he was still learning his craft here.NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is far more interesting than this film because it has a strong sense of irony, has stronger characterization, it has a striking and very creepy visual style to it, and it is better paced. And because it deals with the supernatural undead (instead of a street gang that resembles the undead) it therefore leaves more to the imagination of the viewer in terms of emotion, psychology, politics, metaphor, etc. In short, NOTLD is genuinely cinematic, whereas ASSAULT is just a throwaway drive-in film with bad special effects and boring stock characters. NOTLD will stay with you because the images are so iconic (or iconoclastic) and unusual and you'll wonder what it might mean.

Apart from that, this film is most missable. If you are a fan of 1970s cult films, you can do much, much better than this one. If you are a fan of bad 1970s cult films, then this one is for you.

After seeing it showcased on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments I decided to rent it. I felt that it was a decent movie with an interesting twist on the vampire mythology (interestingly, the 'v' word is never used in the movie), but I still felt as though there was something missing.The film opens with a cowboy named Caleb (Adrian Pasdar) encountering a beautiful, but puzzling young lady named Mae(Jenny Wright) late one evening. After some flirting, they go on a drive back to her place. She continually reminds Caleb that she has to be home before the sun comes up, and thwarts his persistent advances. When he politely declines to let her go home until she gives him a kiss, she gives in and takes out a nice chunk of his neck in the process. She scurries inside and Caleb goes home. But almost immediately he realizes something is wrong. As the sun begins to rise, his skin begins smoldering. As his stunned sister watches from afar, he is abducted by a group of people in a Winnebago. However, we come to find out that they we not people in the ordinary sense of the word. Mae is among them, as they embark on a tour of total destruction throughout the American South and Midwest. Slowly, Caleb begins to realize what he has become and what he must do in order to survive. But will his family manage to intervene before it's too late? The acting in this movie was a lot stronger that your typical horror movie. Bill Paxton contributes a remarkable turn as Severen, a redneck vampire who has a penchant for causing trouble. His performance alone makes the movie worth renting. Lance Henrikson is quite good as the unofficial leader of the clan, as he is clearly evil but not to the point of acting irrationally. The rest of the cast were also good in their roles as well. Near Dark also has the typical love story that all vampire movies seem to require, as seen here with Caleb and Mae. As would be expected, this relationship leads to both characters having to make very difficult decisions and sacrifices for one another. You can just sense a real chemistry between these two actors and they just do a terrific job.Of course, since this is a vampire movie there is an ample amount of death scenes. None of which are particularly harrowing to watch, but gore is not always necessary if you already have a good movie on your hands. The look and feel of the film to me seemed a little more modern that 1987. The director was married to James Cameron at the time, and you can almost feel his essence at times during this movie. It was a strong picture the entire way through. Truth being told, the ending was one of the things I disliked about this film. I won't give it away, but I felt it was just a little contrived. Maybe that's just me. Anyway, I'm giving Near Dark a generous 7\/10. It's worth owning on DVD if you're a big fan of vampire themed flicks.

Jack the Ripper.In the streets of White Chapel, there's the working classes, filth, grime, dirt, drunks, and prostitutes. The movie focuses in on a group of prostitutes. Heather Graham is Mary Kelly, a member of the group and the Ripper's last victim. Another one of them, Anne, has happily gotten out of the life by marrying a wealthy artist and having a child together. Her perfect life is shattered when strange men burst in (during the middle of a very steamy sex scene) and separate her from her husband and child. They disappear. Anne is diagnosed with dementia and is treated (a.k.a - 3 holes are hammered into her skull).From then all, the remaining girls are killed off one by one (by the Ripper of course). Inspector Abberline (Johnny Depp) investigates the murders as they occur. His opening scene is one in which he is having one of his visions while chasing the dragon (smoking opium) in an opium den. He sees the murders before or as they're occurring. Of course we all know of the Ripper, however, the movie is from the perspective that everything that happened, is happening as we watch. We are a part of Victorian London.Jack the Ripper is one of those mysteries. Numerous documentaries and movies have been made on the subject and various theories and conspiracies have been created, because of the lack of a information and a resolution. This movie resides happily within those folds. Just like the real investigation, the movie naturally has holes in it. It fills those hole with atmosphere and style. The murders are very graphics and gets progressively more graphic as the movie wears on. The mood is dark. London is in a perpetual coal fog and everything is black, brown, gray or covered with soot. Color is a sparse commodity, but when it shows is strangely captivating (mainly in the volume of fake blood used). I will not get into the various elements that make for an intriguing mystery as this might ruin the plot and the fun. There is romantic connection between Mary Kelly and Abberline, but it is subtle and is cut short by the plot. There is definitely a class struggle, but that is evident from Dickens and the period. This movie has always stood out in my mind because of its style and atmosphere. I didn't find it scary but at the same time I never feel quite comfortable. It is like your leg starting to fall asleep, yet you are unable to do anything about it. Abberline's ritualistic smoking of opium and his bathtub Absinthe preparation are classic. I can safely say Johnny Depp taught me about and how to drink Absinthe. All in all, this is an intriguing movie worthy of at least a rental.

(I was too young for that sort of movie when it came out but, fortunately--by my teen-age years--it had ascended to the status of cult classic and ran ubiquitously in the Greenwich Village art theaters.) Alex leads a gang that gets drugged out at the local milk bar and then indulges in orgies of violence, rape, and, eventually, murder. The Beethoven fascination that others have mentioned is, frankly, a relatively minor plot component Alex is a big-time fan of the Glorious Ninth and enjoys playing it while playing doctor with girls he's picked up at the local record store. (Odd how, in 1971, the vision of a future society still included LP records, a technology we did away with decades ago--even though a CD is less flexible you can't play your favorite part of your favorite song, and you can't play it at 45 to raise its frequency by four steps.) After murdering an old lady (and me still only fifteen, Alex quasi-guiltily monologues to us), Alex is spirited off to a jail where he is treated to the experimental Ludovico Technique for curing violent offenders by forcefully subjecting them--eyes maintained open with surgical clamps, ears inobstructible--to non-stop barrages of extreme torture, rape, murder, etc. But Alex isn't exactly cured, and, after his return and reintegration into society, the movie--quite honestly--spirals downward in pace, consistency, texture, and, frankly, excitement. The end result is that Alex is still Alex, still a rapist, still a murderer, and still triggered whenever he hears Beethoven's Ode to Joy (a choral section of the Ninth Symphony).What made the book much stronger than the movie, frankly, was its reliance upon Nadsat, the three-quarters-Russian lingo in which the teen-agers communicate. Thus, heads are gullivers (Rus. golowy), friends are droogs (Rus. drugi), brains are mozgs (Rus. mozaki), drinks are peeted with vellocet (spiked with speed, though vellocet obviously hails from the Romance family, not from the East Slavic), etc. It adds tremendously to the pace of the written story if you are quick enough to pick up on the language without having continually to check the appendix to see what is meant when Alex says, e.g., I wasn't expecting the millicent, so I hastily slipped my nagoy nogas into my woolly pantoofles. That was missing from the movie--though it didn't have to be. I remember a cheapo, late '60s or early '70s flick called When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth upon entering the theater, an usher handed you a card that essentially translated the troglodytes' language into English (yes, I know, cave men opposite dinosaurs it clearly isn't a paleontology lesson), although Ringo Starr and John Matuszak's hysterical Caveman managed with only an occasional troglodyte word here and there, which you could always pick up from context.TO THE EDITORS MY SPELLING ERRORS (with the possible exception of inobstructible please check the OED and cheapo well-known slang) are not misspellings, but either words in Nadsat, an artificial language coined by Anthony Burgess for his novel, A Clockwork Orange, or transliterations of Russian words into the Roman alphabet per Polish spelling rules.

It can be summed up this way It is the triumph of spectacle or style over substance. Way, way, way too often, Hollywood relies on special effects, attractive actors and flashy clothes and explosions. It's not that Titanic is a bad movie by any stretch, but it's certainly not a great movie either. The primary flaw is in Director James Cameron's attempt to write the script. I agree with most of the critics I've read that Cameron has a great eye but a somewhat defective ear. The characters are clichéd, poorly written and in many cases the acting is quite sub-par. All of this goes unnoticed by most people of course because of the fact that most Americans don't read enough to know what good, realistic well-written dialog sounds like (not to mention the fact that character development is all but completely overlooked by most major studios these days so most people aren't routinely exposed to truly well-developed interesting characters). All this adds up to the fact that Titanic, while an entertaining and well-done picture, hardly qualifies as the best movie made in 1997 and definitely not one of the best ever as so many people would care to assert. I think that the provider of the overly praise-laden commentary displayed on IMDb for this movie should A) graduate from high school and remember that people who don't think this movie is superb are actually in the minority and B) watch a few more, older movies, particularly those made with great scripts--like The Godfather, Chinatown, The Usual Suspects, Casablanca, any Tarantino or Hitchcock movie--and those with some great actors--like Cary Grant, Kate Hepburn, Laurence Olivier, Ed Norton, Cate Blanchett, Jimmy Stewart, Daniel Day Lewis and Angelica Huston.

I do consider the second film superior to the first (though I love them both) because of the complexity of the characters and, more specifically, the monster. In Shelley's book the monster is lonely but articulate. He seeks out a bride. Frankenstein creates one but then destroys her, making his creature furious and vengeful. This monster actually has a kind part to him. For him to be blunt force thug can only go so far. It works in the first film but how much more growling and stomping could there be? The scenes of him wandering in the countryside, meeting the lonely old blind man in the house in the woods, and being shown kindness by him is very touching. The monster is allowed some humanity; some privacy. We know this can't last because his creator has doomed him. We often see Victor as some kind of hero, but, in reality, he has committed an incredible sin against another being. He wants a companion, but she turns on him and destroys his hope.The setup, with Elsa Lanchester as Mary Shelley, talking with the foremost romantic poets of the time, Percy Shelley and Lord Byron (who also rolls his r's), is a great lead in as she brags about writing a story that will make your skin crawl. She must have been something in that male dominated society. Of course, her mother was one of the first to demand rights for women. When she reappears as the Bride, it is awesome. And who came up with the hair. It is one of those things like the monster's neck bolts, that has become such an icon for our culture. These early Universal films deserve to be judged as major movies. Just because the subject is horror, doesn't mean they should be dismissed. James Whale was a great director with an amazing vision.
