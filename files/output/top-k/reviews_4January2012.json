In other words, it's an exploitation film. What that is, is a film that relies heavily on shocking imagery in order to try and get its point across. What point is it? Well, that war is terrifying. It's not something one should just jump at the chance to be recognized as a hero; you got to really think about your decisions while also consider what these soldiers are really going through.So what is the story? Following the advice of their teacher, a couple kids in Germany decide to sign up to fight during The Great War in order to have the chance to become recognized as heroes. Upon entering, they come to realize that war isn't all that's cracked up to be; it's dark place to be where people all around you die, and your number could be up at any moment.The problems I have with a story like this is that under the wrong mindset, it could be viewed as a way of showing that war is bad and we don't need it in our lives. And maybe if these characters were awful human beings, they would most definitely be correct. But it is called an exploitation film for a reason; it shows the experience rather than preaches anything, leaving one to make the proper interpretations out of this film.But no matter how one interprets this film, it is definitely a reality check (especially under the right mindset). Rather than glorifying (quite the opposite) or criticizing it, what you see is what is really going on out of the battlefield. It ultimately works because it's real. Right down to the characters themselves serving as blank slates for the audience to slip into their shoes.The atmosphere in this film is just perfect. There's very little to no music in this film at all, and the only sound you hear are, not to sound melodramatic or anything, the sounds of war. You don't even hear anybody talk. And you know what? Focusing all the sound on the battle around them rather than on the characters talking or the background music makes it quite an effective direction. It actually ties in with the horrors and the suspense around these soldiers. And there's a point to be made here; this is the first Best Picture winner to have won Best Director, a trend that closely ties the 2 categories for the remainder of the Academy's history.But what this film does for me the most is enforces me the belief that we need to be more supportive of our military than we have been. And I don't mean that we got to keep them out of war as much as possible; but rather, sympathize with why they ultimately go into battle and are willing to risk their lives for our freedom. This film doesn't tell us at all that war is wrong or these people are bad; they are simply doing what they believe is right, and as the people sitting out, we should support and encourage their choices until the bitter end.But regardless, this is an exploitation film anyways; it's not preaching what I'm saying at all; it's just giving us the experience. And that's what this film is; an emotional experience. And unlike something like Sunrise or Platoon, it actually works because what we see is very much what the battlefield is really like. It's a film that makes us understand reality, but allows us to make our own judgments. The only reason why I felt this film's a tad overrated is because it's frequently regarded as one of the best Anti-War films ever made. It's not. It shows us the realities of war; this film makes absolutely no interpretations whatsoever.But to be fair, it isn't all that logical either, but it doesn't have to be.

It had the biggest All-Star cast at the time; MGM invested a ton of money into this picture; it was based on a prestigious play and like the play itself, this is a very weird film. These characters, these interwoven story lines, the acting, even the very idea of the premise are odd. This was one of the earliest mainstream films that actually used the setting to exploit several unrelated stories together rather than to establish a character study or an overall plot, and while a humble beginning to it all, it really shows.What's the film about? Well, the Grand Hotel of course. As Dr. Otternschlag says, People come, people go. Nothing ever happens. It's pretty self-explanatory I think. But the individual stories themselves are an odd collection Greta Garbo, Wallace Beery, John and Lionel Barrymore, the list goes on. I don't want to give anything away because let's face it; you probably want to know how their day goes.So where do I fault the film? Well, as strange the premise is, the film is just okay. It probably would have been better as splice-of-life or a comedy, but the film doesn't meet these expectations. The acting is okay, the writing is okay, and the stories are okay. There's just not all that much worth talking about aside from the All-star cast, the premise itself, and what it did for films in general. And let's face it; there's a ton of films that followed suit with this film that aren't worth anybody's time or effort sitting through (recent examples include Valentine's Day and New Year's Eve).Ultimately, I have no idea what to make of this film as a whole though. A lot of people seem to love it, so maybe there's something in this picture that I'm just not seeing. So maybe I'm just a little thick-headed, maybe not. I can't seem to recall anything about this film that I hated though, but neither do I love anything about it.But this is an oddball film through and through; right down to the Oscar ceremony around it. Not only was this the 2nd of 3 films to have Won Best Picture and nothing else, but this was the only film to have won without a single other Oscar nomination. I have no idea what went on with the voting proceedings back then. Maybe the votes split somewhere; maybe the All-star cast helped contribute the votes to this picture; or maybe the Academy just loved the idea of this picture, but felt the rest was just okay. Even though at the time, they created a couple more categories (The Shorts, Adapted Screenplay, and Sound Recording for the talkies), there were mainly 3 nominees per category whereas Best Picture had 8. Either way, this film is nothing more than an oddity at the Oscars rather than a straight-up classic like All Quiet or The Godfather to name a few.Overall, it's passable, but otherwise nothing special.

Bruce Willis is a reluctant superhero who takes years to come to grips with his powers &#x96; a form of psychic sensitivity, unnatural strength, and, of course, the fact that he is almost indestructible. Samuel L. Jackson is his antithesis &#x96; cerebral (Willis, as I said, has trouble figuring things out), physically fragile to the point of being known as Mr Glass, and for most of the film, relatively immobile and confined to a wheelchair. This film's strong points are its dark, muted colours, its lazy rhythm (long shot lengths) combined with constant slow panning, and its cast. Willis is terrific as a man psychically tortured by his strengths (he has trouble connecting with his wife, his job, and his life in general) who is trying to flee the growing realisation that he doesn't belong, while Jackson is excellent as a man emotionally twisted by his physical impotence. The dialogue is terse, minimalist, and contextualised in an intelligent way, since the thesis-antithesis plot is voiced mostly by Jackson in his character as an art dealer specialising in comic books. Appropriately, the visual imagery analysed and presented by Jackson (which is largely correct, BTW, especially the emphasis on large heads and skewed eyes on villains) acts as a counterpoint and bait to Willis, a kind of blind Argos. Willis' son communicates well the appropriate stunned look of alienation, so we understand his emotional investment in helping his father understand his destiny. The denouement is interesting Jackson sees all, at least in terms of the comic book logic that has been his one crutch throughout his life, yet we discover that he is just as emotionally crippled as he is physically weak, while Willis slowly comes to see his role not as someone made special by his powers, but as someone whose destiny is to be conventionally honest, moral and kind. What is the message? That real heroism is facing the everyday evil of banality (Willis is a security guard who lives in a somewhat grotty home)? Perhaps. I don't think that other actors could have worked so well together to convey this slowly growing tension between blindness and sight, strength and weakness. Okay, Shyamalan has been parodied especially on Robot Chicken for sticking to his formulaic twists that seem too pat, too deus ex machina, but here it works because the underlying narrative structure of the filmic action is the simple black or white logic of comic book morality. Even for the tortured superheroes that have followed on the heels of Spiderman, a sudden twist at the end is appropriate for the war of good and evil. I don't think he chose the comic book backstory for Jackson's character by accident. Yet, despite the apparent simplicity of the moral imperatives that are its backbone, the film manages to provoke.
