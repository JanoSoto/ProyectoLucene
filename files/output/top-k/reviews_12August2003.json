[{"date":"12 August 2003","score":"","review":"  *SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*My friend and I were shooting pool next door to the movie theater showing Can't Hardly Wait. I had a movie pass at the time which let me get into movies for free. A teen comedy for free sounded good to me. So I told him I could shoot pool with him for awhile but then I had to leave at 930 to see the movie. So we started shooting pool and drinking pitchers of beer. I was winning and drinking, drinking and winning.  By the middle of the fifth pitcher, I realized it was 920. Gotta go dude. He steered me to the movie theater and I grabbed a ticket.I found this movie to be quite hysterical. However, if I had seen it sober, I probably wouldn't have laughed as much. The teens are having a big party to celebrate graduation.  Everybody has things they desperately need to say to each other before it's too late. They Can't Hardly Wait. The scene that really had me going was when the nerd starts getting drunk and decides to sing Guns and Roses PARADISE CITY, (one of the greatest rock songs of all time). He's rocking out while drunk out of his mind, (just like me), and a girl in the front of the crowd flashes her boobs at him. He faints but then leaps right back up like the new found Rock God he is.  I would recommend this movie just for that scene. The rest of the movie was a standard teen comedy mixed with some drama.One last thought, keep an eye out for a young Jaime Pressly as one of the cool kids girlfriends. She has a great dancing scene with another girl. It'll be pretty hard to miss her unless you're completely drunk. Burp.

His mother has children from many different marriages (let's here it for the stability that only heterosexuals can bring!!) and she simply has written off her son as not being to bright. The family is unhelpful (mostly) and he is frustrated and angry a lot of the time and he can't deal with life (which is understandable)Now... this one guy... a teacher... he is willing to help this boy. He helps teach the boy the joys of education and expands the boy's horizons on what exists in the world... writing! art! poetry... the power of the mind to think of new things and look at things in different perspectives...BUT - The teacher was in a car accident... and in that accident, a boy died... and many believed that he was a homosexual who was molesting his pupils.Now... we saw the movie... Mel didn't want to teach the kid... the kid wanted Mel to teach him. Mel never touched the kid or oggled the kid... he simply wanted the kid to succeed... he wanted the kid to improve his awareness of the world.If it turned out that Mel's character WAS gay in this movie... should that matter? Wasn't it Mel's character who was the only one to help this boy when all the rest of the community turned their back on him?The premise SHOULD BE that it doesn't matter that Mel's character was gay or straight, because he was the one who helped the boy become a better person.However... what we end up seeing is that the argument is that if Mel was gay... then CLEARLY his reason for helping the boy was because he was hoping to have sex with him somewhere down the road... because apparently the community is RIGHT in thinking that all homosexuals are ALSO pediophyles!And Mel seems to want to tell us the same thing... that all the hard work of the teacher would have OBVIOUSLY had ulterior motives if the teacher was gay.What an insulting sentiment.Even though I'm straight, I just cringed when one of the more importnat and complicated messages of this story were chucked into the wastebasket.I simply cannot enjoy this movie when it has such a message in it... which is a shame, because the movie really does so much very well... and has good acting...but all of that is undermined as clearly as the book it was based on was undermined.
