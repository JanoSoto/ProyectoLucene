I assumed the movie MUST have been terrible for them to just give it away and I am surprised I actually watched it. To my surprise, however, it was most enjoyable...though mindless (at times).The film is one of these ones that you simply must suspend all sense of disbelief--otherwise it simply won't work. Sandra Bullock going from tom-boy FBI agent to nearly winning the Miss United States pageant was a bit far-fetched to say the least. But, if you can do this and stop your brain from nagging you, you'll find that the movie is often delightful.Now you may have noticed that I didn't say this was a great film or a must-see. The movie did have some rough spots (despite some people giving it a 10, this and very few movies deserve a 10). The biggest problem for me is that the setup for Bullock's character went way overboard. Sure, we are supposed to see her as a tough lady--I understood that. But they really went too far--often making her seem too tough to be real and, at times, unlikable. First, no lady who is built like that is going to be the Terminator....tough, yes, Terminator, no! Second, when she met the character played wonderfully by Michael Caine, it was as if the director gave her instructions to behave like a boorish pig. Seeing her eat with the manners of a Doberman was just too much--no one is THAT obnoxious when they eat (at least once they pass age 6). Third, the transformation was just too quick.Now, aside from these difficulties, the film was a delight at times because although the script had problems, it also had some very witty dialog and a cute resolution. In other words, it worked despite its flaws. Partly this was because when not acting boorish, it's hard not to like Miss Bullock. Partly this was because she had some excellent support. And, partly this was because this is a silly little film and silly little films are not supposed to be Shakespeare or a Merchant-Ivory production--it's allowed to be slight yet fun.Overall, a nice time-passer but far from a must see or a 10, though Bullock still scores. Also, I've seen this one more than once and it holds up very well with repeated viewings despite its few deficiencies.

No contemporary writer of the stage to my knowledge covered the themes of this play so brutally frank, and still (let's admit it) maintained a level of wit which, at times, leaves us confused as to what is the proper reaction to what we see. Through the years, the play and the movie has received unanimous praise; however, the story can be hard to fully get at first attempt. I have seen the movie about ten times now and also read the play, and what stands as increasingly fascinating to me is how the story itself diminishes somewhat in importance after repeated viewings, and you find yourself focusing on the characters as though you were an acquaintance spying at them from the bushes, not so interested in from where the arguments evolved as how Stanley, Stella and Blanche deal with them.It is well-known that STREETCAR was not only a turning point in Williams' career, but also in that of Marlon Brando as it made him into a major movie star. However, more than a star, it stands as a testament to his talent that his performance is what we instantly remember; Stanley Kowalski is, if we forget Brando for a moment and view him just as a character on paper, the least fascinating major personality here. It is Blanche, Stella and Mitch that drive the story and undergo significant development; Stanley is, by comparison, a pretty passive brick whose impact consists of influencing the relationships between the three others. With Marlon Brando, however, things turn somewhat different.Brando claimed to have always felt that he was miscast in STREETCAR, pointing at Kowalski for being everything I hate in men vulgar and brutal, not interested in anything. This is understandable, as Brando's convincing performance led people to mistake the actor for actually being the character he performed. But while it is correct that Kowalski certainly is a short-tempered guy, to put it kindly, Brando's execution of this quality is not what have stunned audiences for sixty years now. What Brando did with Kowalski, who on the surface appeared to be little more than a stereotypical macho-man, was to attribute depth of vulnerability into his unquestioned masculinity. Prior to Brando's entrance as Kowalski, masculinity in movies rarely revealed signs of sensitivity, especially not in Hollywood, and on the occasions when they did, it was always executed with moderation; you may see Clark Gable silently crying in GONE WITH THE WIND, but he'd never scream out loud in unlimited frustration as Stanley does in need for Stella, suddenly showing us the other side of his childlike nature. In the hands of contemporary actors, such a strong revelation into a traditional macho-man's childlike nature could easily appear out of touch with the character, but Brando uses it for the advantage of the entirety of Stanley; what he does is not to confuse viewers accustomed to one-dimensional macho-men, but rather to reveal the forced superficiality that had featured so many of his predecessors. Stanley reveals his status as a human being who can be hurt, but rather than letting this distract from his image as a masculine figure, he uses his masculinity to get permission for being vulnerable.Speaking of this, perhaps even more interesting is it to note that when the view on masculinity changed, it did not only affect the male actor but also the female actor in order to meet the new expectations of masculinity, the female lead was forced to change as much as her man. Now unable to rest on the shoulders of comfort which her man had once given her, as it now turned out that these shoulders were as vulnerable as her own, she was also forced to slide into another, more complex role; when the masculine is permitted to display signs of femininity, what was originally feminine must face a more masculine attitude in order to survive. When Stella pardons Stanley for his behavior as she approaches him on the steps, watching him crying on his knees, she is by far the domineering part of the two, but not so much, as one would think, because of her power as a feminine creature; her power lies in the strength, or masculinity, within her own femininity. She apologizes Stanley by entering his arms, as a way of permitting him to treat her as a little girl again, quite paradoxically as she then emphasizes even more that a little girl is not what she truly is.Even though most historians agree that Brando's performance in STREETCAR changed the view on acting and consequently also views on masculinity, others have questioned its relevance by pointing out that 'Method Acting,' while owing its entrance into Hollywood heavily to Brando, has its origins in acting theories pre-dating Brando by centuries. It is no secret that the idea of attributing naturalism into acting began long before Marlon Brando came along, but the fact that he did not invent the term, a rather ridiculous anticipation in the first place, does not diminish his impact on the understanding of it; one thing is to come up with an idea, another thing is to execute it right and yet another thing is to execute it so brilliantly that it will make other students understand the purpose of the idea and follow your footsteps.Obviously, Marlon Brando's performance is what has struck me most about STREETCAR, and is probably the major reason why I seek it out over and over again. However, this review merely consisted of a few thoughts on just a couple of the themes provided in this play. STREETCAR covers numerous issues, and should therefore be of interest to most, even if you disagree with my sentiments here. You can hardly go wrong with Elia Kazan directing a play by Tennesee Williams with Brando, Vivien Leigh, Kim Hunter and Karl Malden involved. STEEELLLAAAA!!

Hundreds of gorgeous costumes, lavish studio sets, a digitally reproduced city of Paris and an abrupt and cartoonish comedic style make this movie musical a one-of-a-kind spectacle.From the very first musical mash-up number in the Moulin Rouge club that consists of around five songs, two of which are Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit and Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend, you get a sense that Moulin Rouge! wants desperately to be different and ultimately unforgettable. The initial gut reaction to the film's camp and genre- butchering is to dismiss it as forced and unnatural, but once the recycled albeit powerful love story takes over, the derring-do of Baz Luhrmann's visually striking show becomes much more easily appreciated.Despite a mix of songs that defies the historical context, Moulin Rouge! takes place in turn-of-the-century Paris in the underground, inspired by the paintings of Toulouse- Lautrec of the burlesque dancers, courtesans and Absinthe-drinkers. Christian (McGregor) is a hopeless romantic poet whose talent earns him a shot to convince the most famous dancer\/performer\/courtesan, Satine (Kidman), and her manager\/pimp, Harold Zidler (Broadbent) at the city's most famous club, the Moulin Rouge, to let him create the show that will turn Satine into a star. At the same time, a wealthy Duke (Roxburgh) is funding the show and one of his conditions is for Satine to be his.Moulin Rouge! is also not shy about love or letting you know its themes are love and everything to do with love and that it's all that matters in life. If not for Kidman's wonderful performance as a morally conflicted woman dealing with masculine pressures and discovering love is indeed possible, one could make the case that the focal relationship between her and Christian around which the rest of the film blooms might never have even begun to ripen. Christian, after all, is a one-dimensional character seeing as he's motivated only by Satine and true love -- he has no other desires. So as Satine falls for him and his incredible ability to steal the material of famous songwriters decades after his lifetime and perform it with a soaring tenor, something must ground the film, and her very real issues, which are inspired by a combination of famous story lines including La Boheme and La Traviata, do the trick.Then there's Luhrmann's (1996's Romeo + Juliet) influences on the film. As it progresses, we begin to love his work here more and more. As the plot thickens and turns for the dramatic (and convincingly so despite so much early antics), his lightning-fast editing choices and lighting become even more effective and the musical numbers being fashioned out of a wide array of songs (like Sting's Roxanne mixed with original tango music) become all the more impressive.Sweeping zoom-ins of a city done all by computer and music numbers that are shot and choreographed in an all too showtune-y manner go from questionable choices to beautiful ones as Luhrmann's twist on a classic love story archetypes matures before our eyes and the true spirit of his film becomes clearer. There are still some goofy elements that don't fit, but the spontaneity of song and its often times non-traditional use is one of the biggest things to make sense and fit Luhrmann's vision with time.Despite only one original song in Come What May, (which should have been allowed to contend for an Oscar) it's more the placement of the songs, the way they follow traditional musical theater rules for song placement -- either setting the mood and foreshadowing the story or expounding on the characters' inner feelings at appropriate times -- makes them so effective. Similar can be said of Moulin Rouge! on the whole though there's an inherent abruptness, randomness and even a faux quality to much of the film, it keeps the traditional love story at its core and everything else is merely growing bountifully from it. There's a reason the same kinds of love stories get recycled in the theater and movies and simply get dressed up a different way and it's because those stories work; they appeal to something human.

It shows that a sequel can be even better then the original and expand on ideas set out in the first film.T2 takes place 10 years after the events of The Terminator, set in year 1995. In the year 2029 the Machines set a second Terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) to 1995 to find and kill John Connor (Edward Furlong) when he is a still a child. The Resistance also send someone to protect John, this time a T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger), the same type of Terminator sent to kill Sarah Connor in 1984. John Connor has become a juvenile delinquent, living foster care, who runs away from home, steals bank cards, rides a mini-bike and goes to the arcade. Sarah Connor (Sarah Connor) had become a Luddite type terrorist, attacking computer factories, and ends up being locked up in a psychiatric hospital. When The Terminator saves John, John get the machine to help him break his mother out of hospital. It is after that event that Sarah, John and the Terminator should stop Judgment Day from happening, by attacking Cyberdyne Systems, as well as stop the T-1000.Some elements of the plot may seen a re-tread of the plot in the first film, but James Cameron, being a skilled writer and director, expands on the ideas of the first film, showing more then just a chase movie. Sarah Connor has grown as a character, from the scared teenager to a strong, kiss-ass woman and it is Linda Hamilton's strongest role. Cameron has a love for strong female characters. Cameron focuses on two key elements on storyteller, plot and character, and that is why T2 is so good. As well as the action and sci-fi storyline, T2 is the eternal love-story between a boy and his robot. Seriously though, there is a strong relationship and chemistry between John and the Terminator, John teaching the Terminator to be more human, whilst the Terminator acts as a fatherly, guardian figure. Cameron also expands on the theme of fate and choice and that the idea of the future is not set in stone. The film also has some of the best one-liners ever in film.The action is non-stop, relentless and some of the best you will ever see. James Cameron uses both old-fashion techniques for scenes like the chase scene with the truck, but also used to at the time top end special effects, which is effective even now. This film was the first to have a budget over $100 Million, and it is money well spend. The pacing is great, and can not get board during this film.The Terminator is easily Arnold Schwarzenegger's best role because it requires very little acting. It also fun to see a role reversal in this sequel. Robert Patrick has a real menace as the T-1000, all he need was a look and didn't need to say much. He was a lot better then Kristanna Loken in Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines. It was also a smart move to make the T-1000 a regular sized man, not another muscle man. Linda Hamilton is tough and believable, whilst, Edward Furlong had a decent debut. I don't know what happened to him, from staring in T2 and American History X to staring in Uwe Boll films.The Terminator was excellent, Terminator 2, even better, Terminator 3, don't bother.An essential film.

It shows that a sequel can be even better then the original and expand on ideas set out in the first film.T2 takes place 10 years after the events of The Terminator, set in year 1995. In the year 2029 the Machines set a second Terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) to 1995 to find and kill John Connor (Edward Furlong) when he is a still a child. The Resistance also send someone to protect John, this time a T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger), the same type of Terminator sent to kill Sarah Connor in 1984. John Connor has become a juvenile delinquent, living foster care, who runs away from home, steals bank cards, rides a mini-bike and goes to the arcade. Sarah Connor (Sarah Connor) had become a Luddite type terrorist, attacking computer factories, and ends up being locked up in a psychiatric hospital. When The Terminator saves John, John get the machine to help him break his mother out of hospital. It is after that event that Sarah, John and the Terminator should stop Judgment Day from happening, by attacking Cyberdyne Systems, as well as stop the T-1000.Some elements of the plot may seen a re-tread of the plot in the first film, but James Cameron, being a skilled writer and director, expands on the ideas of the first film, showing more then just a chase movie. Sarah Connor has grown as a character, from the scared teenager to a strong, kiss-ass woman and it is Linda Hamilton's strongest role. Cameron has a love for strong female characters. Cameron focuses on two key elements on storyteller, plot and character, and that is why T2 is so good. As well as the action and sci-fi storyline, T2 is the eternal love-story between a boy and his robot. Seriously though, there is a strong relationship and chemistry between John and the Terminator, John teaching the Terminator to be more human, whilst the Terminator acts as a fatherly, guardian figure.

For those raised in the crime-infested atmosphere, could easily relate to the settings and the characters that are portrayed here. For those with knowledge about the Crypts and Bloods gang, this film gives an accurate almost nostalgic preview of these two rival gangs and what they faced everyday in their lives. But it's the humanity that this film offers that makes this film perfectly nuanced as opposed to the clichéd gangster movies that makes them look like evil, deadbeat junkies. Though not primed as a director, Dennis Hopper does an exceptional job giving a grim reality of what the streets of Los Angeles looked like during the late 1980's to the early 1990's. Acting wise, Robert Duvall and Sean Penn work together as the old-cop\/young cop duo as they try to control the streets of Los Angeles from these two feuding gangs. The contrasting mannerisms of these two cops is a great struggle within themselves. The laid-back Duvall can't seem to equal up to the uptight and determined Penn need to find trust between both of them if they wish to put a stop to these powerful gangs, which ends in a tragic finale. Though a bit dated, it still exceeds from those other stupid gangsters films these days. It remains the pinnacle to other gangster-related films like Menace to Society among others. What makes this movie special, is that it equals police life and gang life equally and doesn't go one-sided about it either.

Immediately after his arrival, the media attacks the former Boy Ranger's leader. Unfortunately for Mr. Smith, this isn't the last time lies will come against him. After proposing a bill for a summer camp for boys, a fellow senator Joseph Harrison Paine (Claude Rains) turns against Mr. Smith. His bill, it turns out, interferes with one for a dam to be built on the same plot of land the camp would be located. With the assistance of Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold), a corrupt man in charge of the media and politics in Mr. Smith's home state, false evidence is planted against him and the reality of Washington comes crashing down. Refusing to back down, Mr. Smith continues to fight the corruption, not just for his innocence, but for the future generations.Mr. Smith Goes to Washington was a bold and direct attack of the government's corruption. Frank Capra exposed the greed, lies and lack of interest in the real American people. It wasn't, however, a film to destroy the democracy, but to try and save it. There is a patriotic feel about the movie, one that shows what America is really about. Frank Capra was simply trying to remind the American people what the founding principles were, and that anybody could change the country if they had the will and determination to believe in what was right and not let anything stand in the way of it.The character Jefferson Smith was shown as a regular man with a strong belief in what America was founded on. He developed quite well throughout the film, starting as a naïve man and ending a strong, determined senator. Mr. Smith is seen at his strongest during the filibuster, which he does to expose the corruption to his home state, and prove his innocence. He stands, talking and quoting the constitution for over twenty-three hours straight. By the end, he is hoarse and growing weak. It isn't until Senator Paine has piles of telegrams bought in does Mr. Smith become quiet. As he digs through them, it is obvious just how tired he is, and though determined, his body just shuts down, and he collapsed.
