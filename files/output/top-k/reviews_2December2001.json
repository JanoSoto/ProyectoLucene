The storyline has been quite artfully updated but essentially it's the old-time theatre of menace where the main character's predicament is caused by the triumph of instinct over common sense. What wouldn't a mother do for her son, even (perhaps especially) if he's gay, and the father is absent? It's a solid piece of film-making despite the utter unoriginality. Tilda Swanton (the ethereal bisexual `Orlando') puts in an intense and convincing portrayal of a mother in full protective mode, and the rest of the principals are not bad, though Goran Visnjic as the soft-hearted blackmailer is handicapped by the script, which provides no background and not much context to his character. This character was played to much greater effect, I am told, by a far greater actor, James Mason, in the 1949 version. Jordon Dorrance as Dylan the kid brother is cute, playing an undersea computer game with his snorkel gear on, but there's not much by way of character here. The Lake Tahoe setting is used to the full, but, hey, this isn't meant to be a travel movie. I don't know anything about the guys who made this except they made a movie eight years ago called `Suture' which sounds terribly medical, but here the whole thing is like a historic vessel reconstruction, nicely done, authentic-looking on top, but bog-standard modern down below. Sometimes this is called `homage' to the past but to me it's more like grave robbery. &#150; poor old Hitchcock for example has been done over many times.

But I think you are the f**king antichrist!!!In the end, _Donnie Darko_ is a film about people who feel life and all the emotions within it very deeply.  Donnie himself is a basically sweet-tempered (often courageous) young man who is pathologically terrified of loneliness and the thought of spiritual isolation.  His quest for meaning and self-discovery drives him to the fringes of our reality, which only serves to isolate him more from the world he loves.  The few who understand what Donnie is going through go largely unnoticed (such as his girlfriend Gretchen or a tragically overweight yet remarkable sensitive little girl) or unappreciated (such as Karen, the English teacher whose only sin is trying to show her students that there is no such thing as a true end.)Of course, this movie far from polarizes its characters (indeed, polarization is the last thing this film wants to accomplish) and the majority are just a mishmash of the beautiful and the grotesque Donnie's parents, who are at the same time loving and perpetually confused; the aforementioned self-helper Jim Cunningham, who is desperate to spread the lie that keeps him sane to everybody else; and Donnie's sister, struggling between her identity as an adult and her identity as a child.

It manages to inspire hope, love, dread, laughter, and tears at different points throughout the movie without making you feel least bit like there is a contradiction between those states.

Take the move of setting from Privet Drive to the Hut-on-the-Rock. The movie doesn't give enough explanation of that, and therefore only those who have read the book would understand. Of course there are very few people in Europe and North America who hasn't read the book(s), but the filmmakers should also consider other parts of the world where Harry Potter is not quite as popular.Another thing, Hermione cannot seem to make up her mind about what to call he-who-must-not-be-named. Even in one scene (when the trio are talking near the fireplace) she called him you-know-who, and then Voldemort.

I couldn't help noting that the acting in this movie is a real mixed bag. Some of the acting is fairly good, but there is an uncomfortable amount of bad acting (I mean, no better than in a junior high school acting class) that overshadows the good. As someone commented, many of the characters aren't given much of a chance to act, for they are simply blown away too early in the movie. And as someone else below commented, the one secretary (Leigh, played by Laurie Zimmer), who gets nicked in the arm with a hot round, seems to be ludicrously zombie-like. She is so mechanical in her delivery I almost thought she was a motorized mannequin (with big hair).There are also some glaring lapses in credibility, like, for example the goons outside the station blast away at the precinct house for what must have been 5 minutes, firing literally hundreds of rounds of ammo into the building from all directions. Then, just a few minutes later, Lt. Bishop is shown sticking his head right up to the windows, so as to peer out and see who has been doing all this shooting. That would have been a stupid thing to do in real life, and it seemed a stupid thing to do in this movie. How come they didn't just open fire on him standing there at the window, when they were obviously intent on killing everyone in the precinct?The synthesizer music is cool, and is nicely woven into the story, but it *is* repetitive, I could have used a little more variety with the background music. I also like the sound effects created by having a mass armed assault - but with the whole assault being carried out with silenced weapons. All you hear are numerous spats, plinks, baps, tinks, etc. No booms or bangs like you'd expect in most other gun battle scenes. I don't think I've ever seen that in a movie before, it was pretty cool.A funny scene we see them trying to use an antiquated-looking Motorola 2-way radio set to attempt to call another precinct nearby for help. But one of the hoodlums has cut the connection so they can't use it. If they could have just held out a few more years, they all would have been packing Motorola cell phones. Problem solved! (Also, I like the shameless product promotion scene the people trapped in the precinct need to barricade a door from the incoming goons, so they slide a big old Coca Cola soft drink dispenser across the floor and block the door with it. Gee I wonder how many people, upon seeing this, left their seats to go out and get a Coke?)Anyway, I don't want to diss it entirely, it is an interesting movie, (really more of a curiosity) but I regret that I can't give it the glowing endorsement that many others have. Yes, I respect the fact that the budget was tight, but there are many other equally low-budget films that can easily boast of much better acting and tighter plot. To me this flick comes across more like a 60's drive-in horror movie than a compelling crime story. And as far as police stories go, I think I got more cop-story entertainment from watching the average Barney Miller episode than I got from watching this at-times dopey hoodlums-on-the-rampage crime movie.

I've read the books, loved the world, and admittedly, I've been a little hesitant as I've watched this great series overmarketed to the point where it's almost the next Pokemon.Fortunately, the movie retains the dignity of the book.I've seen a lot of mixed reaction to this film.  Some absolutely love it.  Others think it slow-paced and incredibly dull.  I think the enjoyment of this film will be based on if you read the books or not.  I do think some of the terminology and understoods of the character motivations in the movie would be somewhat incomprehensible for someone not initiated with Potter's world.  Hopefully, this would prompt the uninitiated to read the books before they blast this movie or see the next one.  The source material is very accurate with only minor deviations.That aside, as someone who HAS read the book, I thought the film was quite simply delightful; a term that I normally don't use in describing a film.  It adequately captures the moments that made the book so much fun to read.  It captures all the details of the books, from Halloween to Christmas, the the Return of the Jedi-esque (in speed and pacing at least) Quidditch match, and even the moments of Harry's wonder of his new world as well as his feelings of dealing with the truth of the loss of his parents.  What moments I feared would be lost in the translation were kept in there.  As for the cast themselves, the children playing Harry, Ron and Hermione were very likable and accurate to their book counterparts.  The same goes for the adults as well.True, like any book-based movie, there are changes.  The good news is that even if they moved a conversation or act, they normally made reference to it in some way rather than forgetting it.  The biggest omission I noticed was the removal of Peeves.  Hopefully, he'll make a return in the second film.Another thing people have criticized about this film is John Williams' score.  Yes, it does not have the impact of say Star Wars, E.T., Indiana Jones or Schindler's List, but it does add to the film and not overwhelm it sell the movie like a lot of people feel it does.  There's no one forcing hands or wallets to go buy the soundtrack.  Perhaps people wanted a soundtrack with Jessica Simpson or yet another film with Smashmouth's All-Star placed in it. As a fan, I had a good time with this film, and was glad to see that they kept the feel of the book as well as they did.  For a children's (I used the term loosely based off the number of adults who enjoy it as well) film, clocking in around 2 1\/2 hours is a pretty long time to ask kids to sit through, but I think older kids will be able to.  Plus, there are a few scenes that may be a bit too intense for the little ones, such as dealing with Voldemort and Fluffy.I recommend this film.  It's easily one of the best I've seen for this year.  I will, however, give this recommendation If you don't know Harry Potter, I really suggest reading the book before or directly after seeing this film so you can make comparisons to it.  You'll find the two don't change that much from the other, and knowing the source material beforehand, while not mandatory, will certainly help make the experience that much more enjoyable.  And if you don't want to read the books, ask someone close by.  You'll run across more people who know of it than don't.One can only wonder how long a film the phonebook-sized Book 4 will be....
