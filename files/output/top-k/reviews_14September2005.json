Frank, a 6 ft tall rabbit is sent to warn Donnie of the end of the world and help guide Donnie into a position where he will send the engine back through time, which will close the parallel time frame and save the world. Donnie meets a girl called Gretchen (Jena Malone), who has moved into the neighbourhood and has been put in the same class as Donnie; Donnie takes an immediate like to her. Frank manipulates Donnie into burning down a man's house which, means that Donnie's mum has to take his sister to a dancing competition. To get to the location of the competition they must go by plane, which leaves the plane in the correct position to deposit its engine into the black hole. As the climax begins to unfold Donnie unwittingly gets Gretchen killed, and realises his mother and sister will also die if he doesn't close up the black hole. At the end of the film Donnie kills Frank. Closing the black hole means that Donnie will sacrifice his own life, saves Gretchen from being killed, he doesn't burn down Cunningham's (Patrick swayze) house so that means that his mother and sister aren't on the plane (the other mother has taken them). He also doesn't kill Frank and everybody wakes up on what would have been the 1st of October (the beginning of the film) to news that Donnie has been killed by the jet engine that landed in his room.Although the film has a very complex plot, it has you gripped from beginning to end. Donnie Darko is not a film that you can categorise into just one type of genre, its thrilling, it's full of fantasy, the whole film is a mystery, its got drama within it and also sci-fi. The film has a very interesting ending; it goes round in a circular motion, the more the film moves on the closer you get back to the beginning, so by the end of the film you are back to where you started, in this case back at Donnie's house when the engine crashes in to Donnie's bedroom. All the answers to the ending to of film are there you have just got to look hard to find them. This is not a film I would recommend to anyone who likes to lay back and just watch a film without having to do much thinking. The film was made in America which suggests that it's going to be a happy ending and everything will work out fine. This to some extent is true but however it's not for Donnie who dies. The movie was set in 1988 and take place over a period of 28 days. Donnie Darko proved popular with the teenage audience. This is because the film is about teenagers and their life at secondary school, which a teenage audience can relate to. Many people stereotype teenage films into that they are all sex, or lovey-dovey but when the release of Donnie Darko came about this all changed. Donnie Darko is a film which is similar to back to the future and if people give the film a chance would appeal to an older audience as well. This movie is beautifully made, considering the budget was a mere $4.5 million. Richard Kelly the writer and director of this film were only 26 when this film hit the theatres in October 2001. Throughout the film there are many interesting use of special effects. The one that stands out to me the most is when Donnie is in the bathroom taking his medication and Frank appears, as Donnie reaches out his hand is stopped by a rippling sheet of 'glass'. Frank repeats this process and the same happens to him. This stands out to me the most because its something you don't expect to happen and I like things to surprise me. Donnie also starts to see wormholes coming out of people's chests, seeming to psychically illuminate where they are going in the immediate future. It's an eye-opener for Donnie and it leads him into the field of time travel. These wormholes look like tubes of water and they are located in the stomach of the people he looks at, they move also the air and take the person to where they want to go.Donnie Darko has a questionable climax (all the answers are in the film but many people choose not to look for clues) but I think it is in keeping with the movie's theme of how unexplained events can change a person, if not a whole family, even a small town. Donnie Darko is on to something - he is searching for meaning in life and in the universe (he has an interest in time travel). His girlfriend, Gretchen is searching for peace and beauty in the world. It is rare in movies today to see young people engaged in such rational thoughts. That is part of what makes Donnie Darko so refreshing. With all these concepts taken into account I would say that Donnie Darko is one of the best films I have ever seen and I would certainly recommend it to others if they haven't already seen this masterpiece, especially since it was quite a low budget film and it has still managed to have an impact on the audience with the special effects, which you would not usually expect from a film of this amount.

As we pull back, a pair of gloved hands with clippers appear and snip the flower off.We continue pulling back to discover Carolyn Burnham&#133;This is an excerpt from the script to the film American Beauty, and in this small piece of text accurately portrays one of the meanings of the story of this film, something as beautiful as a perfect red rose, symbolising life, love and passion, being cut off&#133; left to wither away and eventually die. Sam Mendes, the film's director, mentioned that Red roses are a symbol of Carolyn, a symbol of his (Lester's) other life&#133;, throughout the movie red roses and dark crimson colours dominate nearly every scene in some aspect.The film American Beauty deals with many issues of modern suburban life in middle-class America, but the main issue that it seems to confronted is how people who live these suburban lives can feel trapped, isolated, and worst of all, absolutely helpless to get back the joy that they once had. This film is about one suburban man, Lester Burnham; played by Kevin Spacey, who breaks free from his entrapping suburban life and starts to take control, and for once in a long time, do what he really wants to do&#133; even if that means quitting his monotonous job, buying a 1970 Pontiac Firebird, smoking weed, doing weights and working in a fast-food shop&#133; a job with as little responsibilities as possible. The scriptwriter of American Beauty, Alan Ball, sums this up in one quote; &#133;the movie is about people who are searching for the meaning in their lives.The conflict in the film was actually hard to pick out, because there was so much conflict and tension between so many of the characters already, not to mention to conflict that is shown between the individual and society, when looking at it on a large scale. Throughout the film the main conflicts are of Lester and his wife Carolyn, Lester and his job, Ricky Fits (Lester's dealer and daughter's boyfriend) and his dad&#133; last of all Ricky's dad, Col. Frank Fits; played by Chris Cooper, and himself, as shown later in the movie.The tag line to the movie is Look closer, this does not mean scan each scene and use a digital zoom to look for some hidden meaning. Even though there are many important features hidden in the background of the film, the meaning of Look closer is that sometimes we need to stop and just look at something to find the meaning and beauty of it, as many people in America are always in such a rush to do things they cannot see these things because they aren't looking. Alan Ball commented on the meaning of looking closer; Beauty is in the strangest places. A piece of garbage floating in the wind, and that beauty exists here in America. It exists everywhere. You have to develop an eye for it to be able to see it.American Beauty deals with the issue that modern American people no longer have the time available to then to enjoy simple things in life, they have placed material goods over the joys of being alive. This is seen in a scene in the film when Lester and his wife Carolyn manage to briefly rekindle their love life, but just as Lester is about to kiss Carolyn she stops him because he was about to spill beer on their six-thousand dollar couch. Gone, the passion is once more destroyed my Carolyn's materialism.Climax comes at a point near the end of the film, it is as all things seem to be coming to an end, the older characters have ended their journeys, whilst the younger characters have only just begun theirs. In the last few scenes of the movie Lester is shown to know that his story is ending, but keeping to aspects and conventions of a tragedy, he does nothing about it. Lester gets an opportunity to fulfil his fantasy with his daughter Jane's friend, Angela; played by Mena Suvari, but when she tells him that she is a virgin he realises how old he really is, and the paternal side of him comes out. That is the end of his fantasy, the end of his journey of self discovery and also, to an extent, the end of Angela's journey as well, because she is exposed to the viewers and herself of who and what she really is, not what she makes her self out to be to other people.The viewers are positioned to believe that Carolyn is going to do something exceptional, but her opportunity is spoiled by Frank Fits. At this point both Frank and Carolyn have also ended their journeys, the end product; Lester is dead, a hole blown into the back of his head.In a conclusion I have to say that even though I enjoyed America Beauty I had troubles with it because of the sheer amounts of content possessed in the film, every single scene had an important point, comment or meaning to it, whether it reflected characters in the film, influences the story of the film, or comments on the real world there was always something to be seen or made out.Directed by Sam Mendes.

Alan Ball commented on the meaning of looking closer; Beauty is in the strangest places. A piece of garbage floating in the wind, and that beauty exists here in America. It exists everywhere. You have to develop an eye for it to be able to see it.American Beauty deals with the issue that modern American people no longer have the time available to then to enjoy simple things in life, they have placed material goods over the joys of being alive. This is seen in a scene in the film when Lester and his wife Carolyn manage to briefly rekindle their love life, but just as Lester is about to kiss Carolyn she stops him because he was about to spill beer on their six-thousand dollar couch. Gone, the passion is once more destroyed my Carolyn's materialism.Climax comes at a point near the end of the film, it is as all things seem to be coming to an end, the older characters have ended their journeys, whilst the younger characters have only just begun theirs. In the last few scenes of the movie Lester is shown to know that his story is ending, but keeping to aspects and conventions of a tragedy, he does nothing about it. Lester gets an opportunity to fulfil his fantasy with his daughter Jane's friend, Angela; played by Mena Suvari, but when she tells him that she is a virgin he realises how old he really is, and the paternal side of him comes out. That is the end of his fantasy, the end of his journey of self discovery and also, to an extent, the end of Angela's journey as well, because she is exposed to the viewers and herself of who and what she really is, not what she makes her self out to be to other people.The viewers are positioned to believe that Carolyn is going to do something exceptional, but her opportunity is spoiled by Frank Fits. At this point both Frank and Carolyn have also ended their journeys, the end product; Lester is dead, a hole blown into the back of his head.In a conclusion I have to say that even though I enjoyed America Beauty I had troubles with it because of the sheer amounts of content possessed in the film, every single scene had an important point, comment or meaning to it, whether it reflected characters in the film, influences the story of the film, or comments on the real world there was always something to be seen or made out.Directed by Sam Mendes.

Although I think Broccoli was not aware of what Bond really stood for, paying far more attention to action and stunts than story lines and scripting( Moonraker attests to that), he nevertheless managed to produce some outstanding Bond movies. The one under discussion here also features an exceptional performance by Roger Moore, who proved he could really rise to he challenge of playing the world most famous secret agent in his own way.Despite having a thin plot( which Bond film doesn't?), Spy is still a grandiose adventure, with a romantic edge to it that works wonderfully. The initial section of the film, set in Egypt, though slow-paced, allows for a delightful romance between 007 and Russian female counterpart XXX. There is real chemistry between Roger and Bach,rendering the film believable they are just the world coolest secret agents, and they naturally fall in love.However, the movie has still its share of thrills and mind-boggling stunts. The Lotus Sprit is perhaps the coolest car to ever grace a Bond movie and the final confrontation on board the Lyparus, a gritty and crisply directed sequence ,remains one of the series highlights. Jaws makes his first appearance , and all of his showdowns with Bond have a real sense of danger to them.As for Lewis Gilbert, after having crafted the sheer spectacle of You Only Live Twice, he is equally comfortable here dealing with the romantic side of the story, as well as the humorous, light-hearted touches spread throughout the film. (An special mention should go to the priceless scene of the Lotus Sprit emerging from the water before the amazed tourists' eyes).While many so-called Bond fans despise this comic relief, I think it is necessary to balance the moments of seriousness and violence. Marvin Hamlisch's Oscar nominated score effectively helps Gilbert to create the special mood that permeates this film.But perhaps the most compelling aspect of this movie was Moore's performance, possibly the definitive portrayal of Bond. He is witty and seductive ,but he is ready to kill unhesitatingly if necessary. Check out the Egyptian rooftop fist fight sequence and you will know what I mean. The gesture of coldness and anger of Moore is unforgettable. He obviously wants to kill the guy, but still waits a few seconds to get the information before dropping him.Where did all this go? Moonraker, for all its entertaining moments, seems a self-parody,not to mention the slapstick in Octopussy. Fortunately, this approach to the character was recovered in For Your Eyes Only, not as brilliant as this movie, but still worth a look.All in all, this is Moore's best and definitely ranks up there alongside Goldfinger and You Only Live Twice ","genre":null},{"date":"14 September 2005","score":"21 out of 39 people found the following review useful","review":" The Spy Who Loved Me was the first Bond film to be produced solely by Albert R.

But as the picture goes on, you can see the yearning to get out. He is a bird that has been caged wrongfully, and when you see how long he has been locked away for, even though he didn't do it it really makes for stunning and compelling viewing.

Some even refer to it as a '90s version of Kubrick's masterpiece A Clockwork Orange, with added blood. Such descriptions are very reductive and misleading.It may be very violent at times (the most gruesome bits make Scorsese's movies look rather tame), that's undeniable, but Fight Club is much more than that. Its complex, non-linear and fascinating script (based on the eponymous cult novel) deals with revolution, madness, and yes, fascism on a certain level, and the film's greatness lies in how David Fincher, who had already shown his edgy talent on Se7en and is at the top of his game here, combines those themes to comment on our society. That's right, beneath the gore and anarchic atmosphere lies a carefully constructed, though not very subtle, satire on consumerism (as Brad Pitt's character puts it Advertising has us chasing sports cars and clothes, working jobs we hate, so we can buy sh*t we don't need).The film stars Edward Norton as a nameless, bored, insomniac office geek who's trying to find a meaning for his life. In order to do this he starts attending various support groups, even though he has none of the diseases (testicular cancer among them) dealt with in those groups.This is when he meets Marla Singer (an almost unrecognizable Helena Bonham Carter), a woman who fakes as much as he does, and accuses her of messing up his life. The real mess, however, starts when the Narrator runs into Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) this guy claims to be a simple soap producer and salesman, but in reality he's a rebel, a psychopath who thinks people truly know themselves only after they have been in a fight. Together, the two create Fight Club, an illegal association where frustrated men in their thirties can unleash all their suppressed rage, as long as they follow some simple rules (as a matter of fact, writing this review constitutes a violation of the first two). But as everyone knows, violence creates more violence, and soon enough what started as an unusual way to deal with boredom becomes an increasingly dangerous game of manipulation and destruction.Said manipulation suits Fincher well, the dark, bizarrely funny universe he has created serving as a tool to reflect not only on the changing society, but also on film itself as an art-form. While the characters break the rules on screen, the director breaks them on his own work, frequently exposing the fictional nature of what is being shown (the characters address the audience directly, a pornographic frame Tyler inserts in a family movie pops up in the actual film). In the middle of this controlled chaos, Fincher can rely on a marvelous cast Norton is mesmerizing, seamlessly moving from total apathy to fearful awareness; Bonham Carter still has to find a role as demanding, compelling and rewarding as Marla; as for Brad Pitt, he shamelessly steals the show from start to finish, perfecting the edge he had started to develop in Se7en and giving us his best performance ever. Incendiary and effortlessly cool, his only real turn as a villain is a mix of style, darkness and charisma that has been missing in every character he has played since..An absolute masterpiece, albeit one that demands at least a second viewing before it can be completely understood and embraced, Fight Club is one of the greatest movies of the '90s, perhaps even THE best of the entire decade.Totally unmissable ","genre":null},{"date":"14 September 2005","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" There is a huge misconception regarding this movie a superficial plot summary will dismiss it as a hyper-violent thriller with fascist undertones (in fact, Roger Ebert called it the most frankly and cheerfully fascist big-star movie since Death Wish).

Some of the SFX hold up today, but others are just incredibly cheesy. In between serious moments, we have dream moments in which the kids proclaim to be the Wizard Master or beautiful and bad. It is oh so very cheesy. Heather Langenkamp isn't as convincing as she was in the first, and doesn't even seem to be trying while John Saxon in a brief return as Nancy's father. The soundtrack even features several songs by 80s metal band Dokken - you know you love 80s metal.'Dream Warriors' is one of the better Elm Street movies. It isn't perfect, but anyone who wants to watch the series should skip part 2 and straight to this - 7\/10 ","genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"14 September 2005","score":"16 out of 17 people found the following review useful","review":" Sometimes it's completely incomprehensible to understand how Carried Away, the excellent film by Brazilian director Bruno Barreto, is perceived by some of the contributors to this forum. Carried Away is a movie based on a novella by Jim Harrison with a fine screenplay by Ed Jones, who does a fine job in adapting it for the viewer. Mr. Barreto is not a timid man, as he has shown in his other films. While most people object to the graphic nudity, it is never in one's face, or something that is done for shock value, like some other directors tend to do whenever they don't have anything better to say.The story about a sensitive man who has been left somewhat crippled after a childhood accident in the farm where he lives, presents us a man in turmoil. His life, while not completely shattered, is in total disarray as one meets him, years after he suffered the foot injury. Joseph Svenden is basically a decent man. We watch him in the rural school where he teaches, and later on, working in the farm where he lives with his older mother. Joseph is clearly a man whose life has passed him by because since he never married, he has stayed behind with the mother, while his siblings are all settled and living away.Joseph is seeing Rosalee, another teacher from his school. They have a cozy arrangement. Neither of them is in a rush to formalize their relationship. At this point of his life, Joseph falls for one of his students, Catherine, who obviously is way ahead of him in being sexually active. She seduces the quiet man, who falls head over heels with this young woman, who comes from an unhappy home. In fact, we have no clue until almost the end, when Catherine's parents come to confront Joseph, what's wrong with the young woman.The kind Rosalee finds out in the worst way about Joseph's infidelity, sending her into despair because she loves the man. Joseph confronts Rosalee and owns up to his transgression. Joseph's feelings for Rosale make him finally see where his priorities ought to be. The last sequence of Joseph and Rosalee at the beach has to be one of the loveliest moments in the film.Dennis Hopper plays Joseph to perfection. Mr. Hopper is believable in his low key approach to the role. He is an actor who works well with any director, and it seems to us he is responding well to Mr. Barreto's guidance. Amy Irving, an actress of great beauty and inner power, shows a Rosalee that shows no emotion at all, but we know all is well under control inside her, until the explosion at the end when she feels betrayed by the man she loves. Ms. Irving does excellent work in the film. Amy Locane, plays Catherine as a brat who wants to get what she wants, when she wants it. Mr. Locane is a beautiful sight on the screen. The rest of the cast, Hal Halbrook, Julie Harris, Gary Busey, and the rest, are seen at their best.Thanks to Bruno Barreto for bringing this lovely character study to the screen.

If they're men - particularly straight men - they often say, with puffed-up chest, that they don't care about crap like acting, writing, directing, or anything else. They just want good action and lots of it. Don't get me wrong I like action flicks myself! But what's wrong with expecting something in the way of quality? It's probably far too late in the game to look forward to originality in the Action genre, so why is it too much to ask for, say, clever writing, inventive stunts, crackling-good dialogue, solid acting, and direction that doesn't look phoned-in? Fair Game, essentially a remake of a painfully funny 1986 turkey, Cobra, starring Sylvester Stallone and then-bride, hulking she-beast Brigitte Nielsen, tells the story of a beautiful lawyer and a studly cop being chased by baddies. Many people die and even more things blow up in the process. The cop is played by William Baldwin; the lawyer by model Cindy Crawford, in her acting debut. From the film's outset, they are at odds, but it doesn't require a Master's Degree to figure out they're going to get along JUST FINE before the end. This is one of those films where, in the midst of being chased endlessly by a ruthless band of Russian thieves, the two leads find time to disrobe and get intimate. Just like real life. It's also the type of film in which, no matter how brutally our leads get beaten, or how bruised and battered and bloodied they be, they somehow manage to look merely tousled and none worse for the wear. Just like real life. As for those Russian baddies, you KNOW they're bad because they ARE, after all, Russian, and in Hollywood you know what THAT means one of them will be a steroid-riddled she-male (kind of like former WWE star, Joanie Chyna Laurer). That role this time belongs to Jenette Goldstein, best known as that fabulously butch soldier in Aliens. In Fair Game you KNOW she's not to be messed with because 1) she's outfitted in bulky black leather, 2) she speaks with a generic Eurotrash accent and says witty things like Let mama make it feel better! while beating up Baldwin, and, most importantly, 3) she's given a brutal haircut and has bright red lipstick slashed across her downturned mouth. It's like she's fresh from playing a warden in a women-in-prison flick! Alas, these camp moments provide the only levity in a pretty sad affair, made none the better by its stars, who share absolutely ZERO CHEMISTRY. Baldwin is his usual self pretty. Cindy Crawford is also HER usual self pretty. And therein might lie the problem they're both stunningly pretty, which makes the action less-than-believable, somehow. (In fact, HE'S even prettier than SHE is!) Action stars should have a little roughness, if not overtly then around the edges. Runway-model beauty is fine for drama and romantic comedy but an action flick? It just doesn't seem to work, at least not here. It sure ain't helped by a hapless director who seems intent on pleasing both his stars by maintaining his stars' prettiness at all costs, even when the effect is downright comical. (As mentioned earlier, they come through fights, brawls, gunshots, whippings, you name it, with only the teensiest of scratches on maybe an arm but never - and I mean NEVER - on the face. Just like real life.) Baldwin has never really been much of an actor, and he often seems to have little, if any, chemistry with his female co-stars (perhaps because he's usually prettier than them?), but I suppose he tries his manful best to give a credible performance (or at least as credible as is possible with this movie). As for Crawford, well...bless her heart, she tries. She really, really tries. Unfortunately, as soon as she opens her mouth to say her first line, the truth becomes achingly obvious she simply cannot act. You give the poor girl credit for trying, but let's face it in what bizarre alternate universe would YOU believe Cindy Crawford to be a high-priced, amazingly successful lawyer? To make up for this and other mistakes, the makers decide to throw in explosions and gunshots almost at random, or whenever the tempo slows. They even manage to throw in some violence during a lovemaking scene (on a freight train, no less). Said lovemaking reaches the levels of The Specialist at its robotic best she flashes her breast, he shows his posterior, and the lighting in the freight car goes all cool blue as they bump, grind, and gnash their teeth in imagined ecstasy. Then, suddenly, a gunman arrives to take care of our 'heroes'. However, said gunman is quite the gentleman because even though he has the clearest shot in the world, he waits patiently for Crawford to see him, pick up a conveniently placed gun, and shoot him. What a guy! In fact, MOST of the bad guys here do the same thing, again and again run up to fire at their target, then pause while Baldwin or Crawford can shoot first. It's refreshing to see that even though they're Russian, they have such an incredible sense of manners! But who watches this stuff for manners, anyway? You want action and blowin' up and killin' and shootin'? You'll get it here. All the time. Even when there's no reason for it. You want Cindy Crawford in an ever-shrinking tank top? You get that, too. (Body-conscious female viewers might want to keep that in mind next time they're being chased by international killers make sure to wear pre-shrunk tank tops.)

Considering it is the highest-grossing Bond film of all time, I expected it to be at least on the same level as Goldfinger. But it wasn't. As a matter of fact ,it is rather mediocre. The problem is not that silliness that plagued so many Moore's flicks( many of them were nevertheless enjoyable), but a horrible, ill-conceived screenplay and a technical work which seems amateurish. As I have stated many times, Bond films( From Russia with Love aside) are not espionage movies. They are action-adventure flicks, dealing with exhilarating chases and fights ,death-defying stunts and a bevy of beautiful women. Therefore the real problem a Bond movie can face is not a thin ( even nonsensical ) plot, or cardboard characters, but a plodding, non action pace. And Thunderball is slow, painfully slow. For the most part , it is an exotic intrigue which would be OK if there was any mystery to solve. But there isn't. Everyone is a step ahead of Bond.

It's one of those British crime dramas in which people walk around in Saville Row suits, visit Paris and Spain at will, and drive Jaguars -- and the plot centers around a fake Rembrandt painted by Jason Patric, who is double crossed by a couple of co-conspirators and aided by art expert Irene Jacob.The sociologist Dean Maccannel, in his book The Tourist A New Theory of the Leisure Class, has a delightful anecdote about a group of young American tourists in the Louvre or the Prado or someplace, noticing that a number of paintings were designated as having been executed by P. ignotus, Latin for painter unknown. The kids loved P. Ignotus's work, rushing from hanging to hanging, exclaiming, Oh, here's another one by Ignotus! This has nothing to do with the movie unless I want to squeeze it in by saying that I was reminded of Maccannel's story by an argument the fakers are having near the beginning of the film. The production of this fake has taken a long time and Patric has not signed it as Rembrandt van Rijn. The others (who are supposed to be art experts) want him to sign it so they can be sure they'll palm it off as the real thing. But Patric knows (as they should) that not every artist signs every one of his works, Rembrandt included. Without the signature it is less likely to be obviously faked. (I think Michelangelo signed only one of his works, La Pieta, although flamboyantly.) It's kind of interesting to watch Patric fake the painting. Looks convincing enough to me, and I once won a prize for window painting in the 8th grade. The rest of the movie -- with the thieves and murderers in pursuit of Patric and Jacobs -- is kind of routine, with one or two scenes very redolent of Hitchcock. But there's nothing spectacularly WRONG with it. It simply doesn't seem too original and hasn't much in the way of sparkle.Except for Irene Jacob, the art expert who falls for Jason Patric for reasons that escape me because he looks quite ordinary. SHE doesn't though. I think it was Anthony Burgess who remarked of a chapter in James Joyce's Ulysses that it may be gibberish but it's English gibberish. Something like that could be said of Jacob's face. She has even features but they are distinctly French even features. She has deep unripe-olive eyes, is not glamorized in any way, but is nevertheless striking, like the girl in a senior high school class that was only available to the captain of the football team. She has a slender modelesque figure with matching breasts. Badham, the director, is tasteful enough to have her disrobe on camera.The film ends in a trial which is pretty tense and enjoyable, although not in the slightest believable. On trial for murder, Patric has a chance to prove his innocence by reproducing the faked Rembrandt in court, which he can do in a jiffy. One afternoon, in fact. He is well on his way to succeeding, to the dismay of the prosecution and the satisfaction of his counsel, when he stops, throws his palette down, and refuses to go on because Only Rembrandt can paint Rembrandt. Faking someone else's painting hasn't bothered him a whit before and, man, does this epiphany come at the wrong time.No matter. It's kind of enjoyable.

It's been firmly in my top 5 movies for about 20 years. So I was really excited to see this special edition, which I did in New York on the big screen.The added scenes are awesome. I'm not one who likes people go to and tinker with their films but these scenes were nearly perfect inclusions. What wasn't so awesome is the music that's been added to this version, in fact, it's an abomination.Never in a million years would I have expected Elvis to wreak havoc on one of my most beloved movies, especially since I love Elvis. But a bunch of his songs and some surfin' safari tracks are suddenly present as if someone took a Tarantino soundtrack and just stuck it on The Outsiders for the heck of it. At first I tried to put up with it, but in no time I was cringing. Songs were flat out ruining the movie and in some cases overpowering the dialogue. I felt gutted like someone had stabbed me.What these songs did was make the movie peppy. This movie is not supposed to be light, it's drama all the way. But I think this new peppy soundtrack may have convinced a fellow theatergoer that this was a musical comedy, as he continued to laugh at anything that could even be remotely considered funny, odd, or not entirely tragic (including a scene in Johnny's hospital room and after the Let's do it for Johnny line). The music even screwed up the rumble. The only thing that could be worse than this is if 20 years from now Peter Jackson re-scores the Battle at Helm's Deep with the theme from Benny Hill.That's what this new soundtrack did. It made everything SILLY. Seeing this almost makes me want to forgive Darth Vader's hot pink lightsaber from the OT DVDs. I just wish these directors would realize that the magic of their films has everything to do with the time they were released. If, back in the day, you couldn't get the songs you wanted, or the special effects you needed didn't exist, maybe it was because the film gods didn't want you to have them. Once you go back and cram this stuff in, whether you originally intended it to be there or not, the spell is broken. The magic is gone.The Outsiders(1983) is a 10\/10 from me. The version I grew up loving, I had actually taped off TV. And it had scenes that are part of this new version, not the one that's been available on video all this time. These scenes were at the end, including the hearing and Soda running away. I don't know how I'm ever going to see that version again.The Outsiders The Complete Novel(2005) is a 5\/10. I know music is important in film but I never knew how important until now. This version didn't just disappoint me, it upset me. If you loved this movie all these years like I did, I can't imagine that you'll be happy with this. And can you believe I waited to buy it on DVD because I hoped for additional scenes?

It's been firmly in my top 5 movies for about 20 years. So I was really excited to see this special edition, which I did in New York on the big screen.The added scenes are awesome. I'm not one who likes people go to and tinker with their films but these scenes were nearly perfect inclusions. What wasn't so awesome is the music that's been added to this version, in fact, it's an abomination.Never in a million years would I have expected Elvis to wreak havoc on one of my most beloved movies, especially since I love Elvis. But a bunch of his songs and some surfin' safari tracks are suddenly present as if someone took a Tarantino soundtrack and just stuck it on The Outsiders for the heck of it. At first I tried to put up with it, but in no time I was cringing. Songs were flat out ruining the movie and in some cases overpowering the dialogue. I felt gutted like someone had stabbed me.What these songs did was make the movie peppy. This movie is not supposed to be light, it's drama all the way. But I think this new peppy soundtrack may have convinced a fellow theatergoer that this was a musical comedy, as he continued to laugh at anything that could even be remotely considered funny, odd, or not entirely tragic (including a scene in Johnny's hospital room and after the Let's do it for Johnny line). The music even screwed up the rumble. The only thing that could be worse than this is if 20 years from now Peter Jackson re-scores the Battle at Helm's Deep with the theme from Benny Hill.That's what this new soundtrack did. It made everything SILLY. Seeing this almost makes me want to forgive Darth Vader's hot pink lightsaber from the OT DVDs. I just wish these directors would realize that the magic of their films has everything to do with the time they were released. If, back in the day, you couldn't get the songs you wanted, or the special effects you needed didn't exist, maybe it was because the film gods didn't want you to have them. Once you go back and cram this stuff in, whether you originally intended it to be there or not, the spell is broken. The magic is gone.The Outsiders(1983) is a 10\/10 from me. The version I grew up loving, I had actually taped off TV. And it had scenes that are part of this new version, not the one that's been available on video all this time. These scenes were at the end, including the hearing and Soda running away. I don't know how I'm ever going to see that version again.The Outsiders The Complete Novel(2005) is a 5\/10. I know music is important in film but I never knew how important until now. This version didn't just disappoint me, it upset me. If you loved this movie all these years like I did, I can't imagine that you'll be happy with this. And can you believe I waited to buy it on DVD because I hoped for additional scenes? I should have just bought the other one in the first place. I can't even believe that I'm not going to be at the store bright and early Tuesday morning for a special edition of the Outsiders.

It made me laugh out loud and made me feel sad when I was supposed to too. The monsters all live in a city called Monstropolis and they need the screams of children to power everything. Sully (the big blue furry monster) is the top scarer and he and his one-eyed green friend Mike work together at Monsters, Incorporated gathering screams. The monsters are terrified of the children however, thinking that if they get touched by a child they will die. One of the children (she ends up being known as Boo) gets into the monster world and everyone goes into a panic. Sully and Mike must return her to her home before she gets caught. Boo is a cute little character and that's a lot coming from me (I am not a huge fan of small children - it may be because she isn't real). There is also an evil creepy monster called Randal who is planning on kidnapping children to harvest as much scream as possible. The animation was great, I am always amazed at the patience that must go into animating hair, Sully is very hairy. As with all Pixar films there are bloopers during the credits which were really funny. With some of the rubbish that Disney seems to be coming out with (Little Mermaid 2, Jungle Book 2 anyone?), Disney\/Pixar has to be the wave of the future.

But ALPHAVILLE (une étrange aventure de Lemmy Caution) is a poor mix of vivid imagination and all-too-casual production. Was the swinging back-and-forth of a few large studio microphones on their boom stands supposed to invoke a futuristic tension? What about the sloppy placement of current or older model cars in 1960's city locations that rarely appear to be futuristic? These elements can, with careful setup or editing, work in a story like this. But here they seem as if they were last minute decisions, with no pretense, thoughtlessly thrown in to substitute for better set design or art production or locations. If these elements were supposed to help the satire, it was lost on me. I think what Rod Serling and crew accomplished with the use of light and shadow and often limited sets, in his original The Twilight Zone series a few years earlier, was generally more effective (and affective) in the genre than what we have in ALPHVILLE.Also not to my liking is the editing and lack of momentum for the first 30 minutes or so. I liked most of the film that followed, and found the eventual plot points fairly involving, but the introduction to this world of ALPHAVILLE lacked anything to push us forward into it. Rather than enjoying the more nonsensical aspects at the top, I only felt confused, and often bored. I'll admit that some of the cinematography is outright clever, if not just plain fun; but at other times equally dull and awkward, almost as if there were a second unit of student filmmakers, whose shots were inter-cut with Godard and crew's work. These kind of inconsistencies were annoying at best, but often frustrating - and that's not where an audience needs to go in experiencing even the most experimental types of cinema.Once we do get enough of the story to understand what we're seeing, however, there's more than a few very fine moments, and some fairly memorable scenes. There are fine performances, especially from Anna Karina, and the film is often thoughtful (even if much of the subject matter has been covered in many stories after this one). But the beginning gave me such a lost-at-sea feeling, that it's difficult to recommend wading through it to enjoy the more intelligent, creative and even exciting moments of the film.IMHO, art-house films have a tendency to get away with poorly or hastily conceived production and story elements in the name of experimentalism, but I'm not letting ALPHAVILLE off the hook. All involved could have given us a brilliant work, but there are too many problems for me to excuse. View only if you're a true Godard die-hard, or want to see how a well-crafted ending doesn't always mean a good beginning.
