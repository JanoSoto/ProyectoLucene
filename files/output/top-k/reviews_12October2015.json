'Sunset Boulevard.' Does that not just send shivers up your spine? Yes, I am well aware that it is the title of the famous street in Los Angeles in which the film takes place. But it seems more... invocative than just that. If such is pure coincidence, then it is a coincidence that makes a great film even better. But i don't think it was. Knowing the quality of this film, I think that it was meant to invoke deeper feelings in the viewer than just 'oh, that's the name of a street in Los Angeles.' When the film begins, we are greeted with a flash-forward to the end of the movie. I always love it when films or books do this. Surprise is sometimes good, but it is often overrated. Once enough time is out, everyone knows your secret. So there is certainly something to be said for just revealing what happens at the end of the film and launching into an elucidation of how such came to be.We are also greeted with an opening narration. From that moment onwards, this film had me. Not because I am just a sucker for opening narrations (though I am). But because it is just so good. And I say that as a novelist. Truly, it is one of the best openings narrations I've seen or heard, in literature or film or any other medium. With one fell swoop, it sets the tone of film, establishes intrigue and tension, and messages your brain and heart.The style of this film is excellent. Every decision is conscious and It also establishes the fact that this film takes heavily from film noirs. I don't think I would quite consider it a noir on its own night. But it certainly was made by someone who not only loves film noir, but knows how to make use of it, and what it adds to a film. As a lover of noir myself, I will always support that.purposeful, advancing the fabric of the tightly woven story. But style isn't everything. Which makes it a good thing that this film succeeds on grounds of substance as well. It should tell you something that the first work that came to mind as I watched this was The Great Gatsby. It's not a perfect comparison, of course, but it does manage to invoke some of the same complex feelings.There are so many themes at play here that I could be up here until midnight three days from now and still not have covered everything. But you don't need to fully unravel them; for mood and story's sake, it is enough to know that they are there, that they are present and will keep being so. It's like you're a kid watching a complex work for the first time; you may not know every intricacy that is on display, but you nonetheless are comforted by their presences.At its core, this film is about a young, out of work, broke scriptwriter who is just ready to give up on the Hollywood Dream and head back to Ohio when he is confronted with a grand mansion that is owned by an Old Hollywood fading star who invites him in. She sends him to work on her overblown, worthlessly-written screenplay that she thinks will make her a star once more. For this and above all else, for comfort, she persuades him to stay with her. Having no other place to go, the young writer agrees. For a while, he lives the high life. he even gets an expensive suit. But when he wants to leave, she gets clingy and... things get interesting.It gives off the feeling that he is being pulled deeper and deeper into a spider's web. But, in a bit of a twist, the spider does not want to kill him. Yes, she is delusional and insane and dangerous to herself and others. But she has no vile or inherently malicious bones in her body. She is just, at her heart, a lonely and insecure person who is caught up in yearning for past glories, who makes herself feel far older than she really is. The young man has a great quote about this that is both fitting in context and translatable out of it. It goes like this There's nothing tragic about being 50, not unless you try to be 25. Simple.

It is about two teenagers that fall in love in a boat on its way to New York, which brings the light out the boys and girls eyes and it help. Titanic is about a ship that is 'unsinkable' of the historical matter and the love stories from Rose (Kate Winslet) point of view of the movie throughout the whole movie. Rose is 17 years old and she feels in love with a boy that boards the boat Jake (Leonardo DiCaprio). Titanic won 11 Oscars for the filming and cinematography of the movie.

Throughout the movie Forrest tells the story of his life but since he doesn't know any better he was put into the middle of some major historical events that have happened from the 1950s - 1980s. This movie is like no other of the time of its release in 1994, still now in 2015 this movie is a favorite of many. We first see Hanks' character Forrest on a bus bench in Savannah, Georgia telling his story to a stranger that sat next to him. He begins his story at the beginning, him as a boy having to get braces for his legs. His story goes on and he meets Jenny on the bus when no one else would let him sit down. From that moment on Jenny and Forrest are the best of friends. One day bullies were chasing Forrest and Jenny said Run Forrest! Run! and then he started running and his leg braces broke off and he is a very fast child. After a while Forrest finds himself running away from bullies again and he runs straight across a football field and he gets a free ride into college. He goes to tell that he goes through many big historical events and some of those were school integration, he gets to meet President John F. Kennedy, The Vietnam War, he was on a TV show and met John Lennon a few months or so before he died, he inadvertently helps expose the Watergate scandal and many more events. He tells them through his mind and it seems all too innocent because of his low IQ. His relationship with Jenny continues and he keeps trying to save her but she keeps running away. Through Jenny's eyes you see the hippie movement, drug and alcohol abuse, her sleeping around, and a failed suicide attempt. Jenny cleans up and decided to go back to Forrest and stays with him and soon after she runs away again. Forrest Gump is based off of a book called Forrest Gump by Winston Groom in 1986. The book was more harsh than the movie so the film writers took off some of the edge and made it into a more lovable movie. They took out some of the adventures Forrest had because they were a little ridiculous. The movie took great special effects in how they put the actor Tom Hanks into different scenarios in time, such as being put into a video with John F. Kennedy and using special effects to take off Lt. Dan's (Gary Sinise) legs after the Vietnam war scenes. The movie won six Academy awards for Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role, Best Director, Best Visual Effects, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing. The movie was nominated for seven Golden Globe Awards. The film won three of them Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama, Best Director - Motion Picture, and Best Motion Picture - Drama. Forrest Gump was also nominated for six Saturn Awards and won two of them, Best Fantasy Film, and Best Supporting Actor. The movie is also on many lists and it mad #240 on the Greatest Movies of All Time list. I find the movie deserving of all the awards it got and being on all the lists it's on. The acting was great and i could really tell the actors were into the roles they were cast for. Tom Hanks does a wonderful job of playing a disabled man and getting the voice and actions right. I give this movie an 8 out of 10 stars only because it does jump around a tad bit but it works well in the terms how fast you have to go through his whole life. The movie is wonderful and i have watched it so many times with my family and friends. I always find something new when i watch it over again, just those little things you don't notice when you first watch it. I have always found that fascinating.

Run! and then he started running and his leg braces broke off and he is a very fast child. After a while Forrest finds himself running away from bullies again and he runs straight across a football field and he gets a free ride into college. He goes to tell that he goes through many big historical events and some of those were school integration, he gets to meet President John F. Kennedy, The Vietnam War, he was on a TV show and met John Lennon a few months or so before he died, he inadvertently helps expose the Watergate scandal and many more events. He tells them through his mind and it seems all too innocent because of his low IQ. His relationship with Jenny continues and he keeps trying to save her but she keeps running away. Through Jenny's eyes you see the hippie movement, drug and alcohol abuse, her sleeping around, and a failed suicide attempt. Jenny cleans up and decided to go back to Forrest and stays with him and soon after she runs away again. Forrest Gump is based off of a book called Forrest Gump by Winston Groom in 1986. The book was more harsh than the movie so the film writers took off some of the edge and made it into a more lovable movie. They took out some of the adventures Forrest had because they were a little ridiculous. The movie took great special effects in how they put the actor Tom Hanks into different scenarios in time, such as being put into a video with John F. Kennedy and using special effects to take off Lt. Dan's (Gary Sinise) legs after the Vietnam war scenes. The movie won six Academy awards for Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role, Best Director, Best Visual Effects, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing. The movie was nominated for seven Golden Globe Awards. The film won three of them Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama, Best Director - Motion Picture, and Best Motion Picture - Drama. Forrest Gump was also nominated for six Saturn Awards and won two of them, Best Fantasy Film, and Best Supporting Actor. The movie is also on many lists and it mad #240 on the Greatest Movies of All Time list. I find the movie deserving of all the awards it got and being on all the lists it's on. The acting was great and i could really tell the actors were into the roles they were cast for. Tom Hanks does a wonderful job of playing a disabled man and getting the voice and actions right. I give this movie an 8 out of 10 stars only because it does jump around a tad bit but it works well in the terms how fast you have to go through his whole life. The movie is wonderful and i have watched it so many times with my family and friends. I always find something new when i watch it over again, just those little things you don't notice when you first watch it. I have always found that fascinating.

Thank heavens for movie subjectivity! Anyhow, Airport is a movie that is the pioneer for modern disaster movies, but I really enjoyed it. There are undeniably many flaws, but my gosh I had a blast watching the film and the campy tone gave the film spirit. My biggest flaw I had with the film is the scenes involving the personal lives of the manager. I mean, his pending divorce has nothing to do with the rest of the plot, including trying to save the plane. Other than that plot issue, I really had fun watching the granddaddy of all disaster films.This film is about this airport that is stricken due to a blizzard. But even more serious problems arise when a bomb-damaged plane needs an emergency landing in order to save the people on the plane. The manager of the Lincoln Airport, Mel Bakersfield, has his hands full in trying to combat the weather and personnel in order to save the plane.The film has a stacked cast full of Oscar nominees. Now while no one truly gives Oscar-worthy performances, there is no denying that they were solid performances. Burt Lancaster did a good job as Mel and Dean Martin as the head pilot, Vernon. Those performances came across as serious despite the campy tone, but they were still good. However, I felt the best performance came from Helen Hayes, a 70-year-old woman who makes a fuss about plane tickets which causes her to hitch airplane rides while avoiding authorities. Her comic relief was excellent, and maybe she did deserve that Oscar.Overall, Airport is a fun disaster movie and in hindsight, it set the tone for the major disaster movies that will come in the future. It is a great movie? Not really. Is it a fun, entertaining movie? You bet it is! I am very amazed how this film achieved ten Oscar nominations. If this same film was released in 2015, it more likely would have received ten Razzie nominations. Oh how the time change!

Certainly, hackers have done things on a large scale, such as the recent hacking of Sony Pictures Studio and Target stores. If hackers really had the ability to do all the things implied by the film, we wouldn't be able to function in the mechanized world as it is.The film begins when Dade Murphy (Jonny Lee Miller), age 11, engaged one of the most successful and damaging computer hacks in the history of internet infiltration, crashing 1500+ systems.

The stakes if she loses, she has to go on a date with him and wear a dress, or if he loses, he has to become her slave. So they begin the competition, a kind of virtual football match, in true hacking style. They invalidate his credit card, put up a porn ad in his name and give out his business phone number where NY gays and transvestites can call him. They even pull the worst trick they indicate in his file that he's deceased.It's all good fun until the youngest of the hackers, Joey, breaks into The Gibson, an Ellingson Mineral Company supercomputer. He notices there's a strange virus in the system and downloads some of it, putting it on a partially downloaded 3.5 floppy disk (remember those?). The FBI at the behest of their systems security analyst Eugene Belford, a.k.a. The Plague (Fisher Stevens), tracks down Joey and arrests him, but not before he hides the disk. Later, Belford and the FBI storm into Joey's house, and the systems security analyst Belford threatens Dade to give them the information they want, which is hidden on the disk. Dade declines saying he doesn't play well with others, to which Belford takes out his frustration on a piece of music equipment in Dade's bedroom.

Predator (1987) is my personal second favorite best Arnold Schwarzenegger movie out there that it is. The Terminator (1987), Terminator 2 Judgment Day (1991) and Predator (1987) are Arnold Schwarzenegger iconic films that made Arnold in to a star today and he become one of the most memorable heroes of all time. His characters are more famous today than they ever were. I can't think of any action film from the 1980s more masculine than Predator. It's called Predator, which, let's face it, immediately calls to mind hunting and, well, serial killing&#x97;typically macho occupations. Soldiers are found skinned alive in the jungle, Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) sends a generator-powered truck into an enemy camp, blowing it to kingdom come, and Billy (Sonny Landham) wields a giant machete that he uses to rake a jagged wound across his own chest, this is a bad ass amazing scene. Predator is dreadlocked, mandible-mouthed alien with a pulse cannon fantastic. A team of commandos on a mission in a Central American jungle find themselves hunted by an extra-terrestrial warrior. That's your basic plot. Deep in the jungle, several bodies have been discovered skinned and hanging from trees - although who or what could done this is a mystery. Military covert specialist Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his team are called in to eliminate the threat, but once in the heart of menacing jungle, they discover something far worse than they could ever have imagined - the Predator - an alien which has come to Earth with cloaking technology, extensive combat skills and a desire to hunt humans for sport. The now-iconic creature design nearly steals the show&#x97;the predator is scary, bad ass, tribal, and high-tech all at once&#x97;but what really makes the film is how fun it is. This is a movie that has no delusions about what it's supposed to do entertain. The action certainly delivers&#x97;the film has a kill count that almost hits 70&#x97;and the interactions between the characters are, if a bit campy in retrospect, frequently hilarious. This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and CGI Without the vision. The special effect creating the creature - predator are fantastic. The action sequences and combat battles in the jungle with the creature alien is the bad ass mother of all awesomeness ever. The film switches from the horrors of war to the horrors of, well, being stalked through the rainforest by an intergalactic hunter with infrared vision, a cloaking device, and sci-fi weaponry. One by one, the soldiers get picked off&#x97;you could call Predator an action\/slasher&#x97;and each successive kill ups the gore quotient. With these players set in motion, it's up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie. (One often sees great performances in mediocre films... here the story transcends the performances -- an impressive feat.) The script delivers. The film is absolutely filled with great, classic moments (I counted TEN all-star ones during my last viewing), and they're evenly spaced through the movie. The gunplay is delivered in perfect McTiernan-Schwarzenegger style (as opposed to the slo-mo John Woo-style) - you'll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you'll see them used well. The film is violent, bloody, but ALL of the mean-spirited violence is dealt by the evil alien creature character - predator.10\/10 Score bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio 20TH Century Fox, Silver Pictures Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers Bill Duke, Jesse Ventura, Kevin Peter Hall Director John McTiernan Producer Lawrence Gordon, John Davis Writer Shane Black (Uncredited) Rated R Running Time 1 Hr. 47 Mins.

Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers and Kevin Peter Hall. Predator was written by Jim and John Thomas in 1985, under the working title of Hunter. Filming began in April 1986 and creature effects were devised by Stan Winston. The film's budget was around $15 million. Released in the United States on June 12, 1987, it grossed $98,267,558. This is the finest action movie of all time. And, yet, believe it or not, it's not the action in the film itself that makes this be the case. This is the best action film with multiple huge explosions, with thousands of bullets fired, and scores of stuntman used. Predator (1987) the original film and far more superior of the sequels, it is more brilliant, smart, genius, amazing, fast paced and highly entertained fantastic movie ever made. It is an Epic Classic Sci-fi Action flick movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers and the rest of his team, that are all the time in the jungle hunted by an alien Predator,that's what makes this film and the story so fast paced and brilliant interesting. This one is even short and very fast paced, you never get bored or you fall a sleep. My favorite best Action Sci-Fi Flick movie was always Predator and It always will be. Is my number 2 best Action Sci-Fi Epic movie. With Terminator 2 Judgment Day I love this movie to death! Of all three Predator movies my favorite and best one ever it is Predator with Arnold Schwarzenegger best action movie ever. This one was my first movie in childhood that I watch it first. The story is set in the Amazon Jungle, Jesse Ventura was wearing (MTV t-shirt) during the filming of this movie Cast was wonderful and they made a terrific job. When you watch this movie you completely forgot about your worries you just enjoy this movie and you just fall for this movie. Predator (1987) is my personal second favorite best Arnold Schwarzenegger movie out there that it is. The Terminator (1987), Terminator 2 Judgment Day (1991) and Predator (1987) are Arnold Schwarzenegger iconic films that made Arnold in to a star today and he become one of the most memorable heroes of all time. His characters are more famous today than they ever were. I can't think of any action film from the 1980s more masculine than Predator. It's called Predator, which, let's face it, immediately calls to mind hunting and, well, serial killing&#x97;typically macho occupations. Soldiers are found skinned alive in the jungle, Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) sends a generator-powered truck into an enemy camp, blowing it to kingdom come, and Billy (Sonny Landham) wields a giant machete that he uses to rake a jagged wound across his own chest, this is a bad ass amazing scene. Predator is dreadlocked, mandible-mouthed alien with a pulse cannon fantastic. A team of commandos on a mission in a Central American jungle find themselves hunted by an extra-terrestrial warrior. That's your basic plot. Deep in the jungle, several bodies have been discovered skinned and hanging from trees - although who or what could done this is a mystery. Military covert specialist Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his team are called in to eliminate the threat, but once in the heart of menacing jungle, they discover something far worse than they could ever have imagined - the Predator - an alien which has come to Earth with cloaking technology, extensive combat skills and a desire to hunt humans for sport. The now-iconic creature design nearly steals the show&#x97;the predator is scary, bad ass, tribal, and high-tech all at once&#x97;but what really makes the film is how fun it is. This is a movie that has no delusions about what it's supposed to do entertain. The action certainly delivers&#x97;the film has a kill count that almost hits 70&#x97;and the interactions between the characters are, if a bit campy in retrospect, frequently hilarious. This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and CGI Without the vision. The special effect creating the creature - predator are fantastic. The action sequences and combat battles in the jungle with the creature alien is the bad ass mother of all awesomeness ever. The film switches from the horrors of war to the horrors of, well, being stalked through the rainforest by an intergalactic hunter with infrared vision, a cloaking device, and sci-fi weaponry. One by one, the soldiers get picked off&#x97;you could call Predator an action\/slasher&#x97;and each successive kill ups the gore quotient. With these players set in motion, it's up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie.

That opening sequence, with Patton addressing soldiers in front of a draped American flag, shows what kind of character General George S. Patton is. A bloodthirsty, vivid man who is overly fond of his colorful language as well as his hatred towards the Germans. This character is fully embodied by George C. Scott, who delivers such a mesmerizing performance. This is the oldest rule in the acting handbook, but I truly believe I was watching Patton barking orders on screen, not George Scott. I really enjoyed this sprawling war epic, which covered the years Patton served in the war. The film, while suggesting sympathy, tells an unflinching account about whom Patton was and why he wasn't well-liked amongst his superiors. Thanks to a wonderful screenplay by Francis Ford Coppola, the character of George Patton was brought to life on the big screen.Franklin J. Schaffner's film celebrates the life of one of America's finest, but most eccentric generals. The film travels from his conquests over General Rommel in Libya to his downfall which led him not leading the troops at Normandy due to his big mouth and an incident where he slapped a solider. But the film shows him getting back at it by defeating Germans left and right as he marches closer and closer to Berlin.George C. Scott had a wonderful career, but this may be his finest performance he has ever done. In a sense, Scott is almost like Patton. They share nearly the same kind of personality. Scott always seemed to have controversial comments. But that being said, Scott blended into the role of Patton very well. He definitely deserved that Oscar win. The other big actor in the film is Karl Malden, who played General Omar Bradley. He really doesn't have much to do, except to play third wheel to Scott's Patton. But in that case, I believe it is okay here. After all, this film is about George Patton.Overall, Patton is an example on how to make an exemplary biography. It's an extremely wonderful movie thanks to a center magnificent performance by George C. Scott. This is also a war movie, but I was surprised at the lack of battle sequences. Now there were a few, but this was more character-focused than I expected. That is not a complaint, as I love these kind of movies. Now for what little battles we have, the sound and effects work were great. I also loved the score by Jerry Goldsmith, and his use of the pipe organ in the main theme honoring the religious overtone of Patton. This is a great movie that respectfully treats one of the most iconic names in American history.My Grade A ","genre":null},{"date":"12 October 2015","score":"","review":" From viewing the famous opening sequence of the 1970 war movie, Patton, I knew what kind of epic I was in for.
