[{"date":"16 March 2011","score":"","review":" Fight Club shows that everyday life can be quite monotonous, but it is possible to exert your energy elsewhere when you are outside of the work place. The main actors and actress in Fight Club are Brad Pitt (Tyler Durden), Edward Norton (The Narrator) and Helena Bonham Carter (Marla Singer). Each of these individuals did an excellent job when it comes to reeling in their viewers. Throughout the movie a viewer's suspense level will increase due to the fact that they are unsure as to what Tyler will do next.The title of the movie represents the exact meaning of the film because Tyler creates a club of men that can fight against each other in order to exert their aggressions, which were brought on from a long day in the office. The club quickly catches on and explodes into every major city throughout the United States. This film shows how quickly anger can build up in a human being when they are stuck doing the same thing every single day of their lives.Another movie that most of you may be familiar with is Office Space, which is about a group of men that make a pact to change their everyday routine at work. The group of men scheme up a plan to plant a virus on their employer's computer system. While Fight Club is more violent than Office Space, they are both revolved around men that want some excitement in their lives. The lighting in Fight Club is mostly dark due to the fact that fight clubs are done behind closed doors for fear that they will be shut down if they are caught by the police. The lighting also helps in understanding how depressed an individual can become if there is no excitement or suspense in their lives. The variety of characters help to piece this film together for each of them complements each other quite well because they are completely different, but at the same time they have very similar characteristics.There are times when I feel as if my days run together because they are so repetitive. Finding new ways to change the repetitiveness can be difficult, but it is important to figure out what can be done in order to make everyday different. With this said, things can be changed by starting out with the opposite foot in which you take off walking with, carrying things in the other arm and driving a different way to and from work every day.

Railsback, running from the police, comes upon the set and as a stunt man was killed earlier in an accident, O'Toole takes a liking to our run away and hires him for the part.The picture goes awry after this with Railsback thinking that O'Toole has set him up to be killed. There is a wild scene with Railsback going berserk as he had fallen for the leading lady of the film. Her actions and their plans are most absurd. You don't even know if the end were contrived or not. However, by the end, O'Toole is reduced to the typical movie mogul man, fighting over salaries.

The explosions? The exotic women? The fancy gadgets? The Bourne series puts these questions to the test. There are almost no special effects in this movie. There are no explosions in this movie. There are no particularly 'sexy' women in this movie. There are no gadgets in the movie. On the contrary, the computers used by the CIA look like computers that were around in 2004. But I would like to put it out there that The Bourne Identity is one of the best spy-thrillers ever released.The Bourne series is really a blatant winning movie. It's gripping, it's confusing just to the perfect level where the audience has to keep watching to understand the plot. At the end of the movie, we want to know who this man we've come to know as Jason Bourne is.I think we as an audience should challenge ourselves to challenge Hollywood to make more movies like this. Movies that don't rely on that WOAH! factor. Movies that can make it, and be great movies, without sex, gore and violence.For you action junkies out there, don't let this review fool you. There is still action in this movie. The multiple fight scenes, while not filling the movie, are interesting and faced-paced. I firmly recommend this as a must-see movie and a must-see series for anyone who enjoys action movies.
