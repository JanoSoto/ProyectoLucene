Period.This picture is a masterpiece of world cinema.Tykwer has invested what seems like years into every frame of this movie. The concept is layed out in utter brilliance and confidence. The ideas mesh into a cohesive whole and form a very complete and rewarding film. Not only is the picture immensely enteratining, it is done with the care of a true artist, a true lover of film and a huge vision of what can be accomplished in a motion picture.I give these accolades based on many scenes in the movie. I think of the scene in which Lola (played with remarkable kinetic energy by the always amazing Franka Potente) is trying in vain to think of somebody who can assuage her dilemna. She thinks and ponders, time running against her, hands pressing against her drowning mind. Tykwer throws in all of the people that cross her brain for a mere split second of on screen time as she sifts through them all one by one at light speed. This is train of though filmmaking done with bravado. I think of the pacing and all of the little nuances that contribute to the speed of the film, and yet give it some serious emotional depth at the same time. Think of Lola's rage and bitter anger when she finds her father in talks with his mistress at his office. Think of the way Lola and Mani lay in bed together and discuss life in its most simple and yet convoluted of terms. Think of the cartoons, the imagery, the casino, the music...Allot of people may not have noticed, but the bank security guard who comes with Lola in the ambulance when she is hit by the truck turns out to be her REAL father. Yep, it was alluded to earlier in the film by Tykwer when her original father calls her a cuckoos egg, inferring that her mother slept around. Well, turns around her mom slept with the security guard, producing Lola. This may explain the moment of connection between the two in the ambulance and it also explains his reaction when Lola is outside the bank screaming for her father and responds by saying something like, I thought youd never come! or something to that extent. It is sub plots like this that bring this film over the top and just contribute to its sheer strength as a film. If you look deeper into this film, you will find allot more than running.When Lola comes into the casino towards the end, looking anything but posh and in contrast to the rest of upper crusties present, Tykwer captures what I consider to be one of the most powerful ensemble moments in film history, without ANY WORDS! Lola struts in, takes a gamble, screams her lungs out, and walks out (fair and sqaure) with a massive lump sum of money. Watch how after this happens, Tykwer pans the camera slowly across the room. Every face he captures is one of utter and complete shock. Where did he find these people? How did he capture such amazing honesty? Look again and tell me it isnt an awe inspiring scene.Tykwer makes films for people who want to get whatever they want out of them. They are not black and white and they are not maniuplating. They are what they are. This work resembles the high octane punch of Picasso's 'Guernica', while his other landmark picture, The Princess and the Warrior has a slow burning and amazingly effective dose of Monet's Giverny paintings. He is both versatile and proffesional. If Run Lola Run goes down as his signature work, I would not be dissapointed.It is the work of an artist and a genius.

Everyone but William H. Macy overacts to the point of charicature, which is appropriate, since the film is a charicature of its genre.To be specific, I think the movie fails on 3 fronts1) The plot is rife with logical nonsequiturs.  At the very core, the entire basis for the movie falls apart with any scrutiny.  The kid is only a threat to the mob if he DOESN'T talk - once he talks, the damage is done, and he's of no interest to the mob (I don't think the mob kills kids for telling the cops what they know!).  So, to protect himself, the first thing he would do is squeal.  Even ignoring the big plot lapse, there are several aspects that leave you scratching your head, like why is it that the DA, who's trying to convict the mob assassin, is the BAD GUY in this?  Why is the kid so mad at his lawyer?  Why did the kid break out of jail - it was the only place he was safe!  These nagging questions just go on and on as you watch this movie.2)  The actors overact.  In the case of Tommy Lee Jones,he does a great job in creating a slick, manipulative DA (see above), but it is so cliche, as to be cartoonish.  Susan Sarandon does a good job, also, but it's not really a role that should have been oscar-nomination material - aside from her past life troubles, there's not much there for her character.  My complaint with her is that her character is, again, cliche.  The most egregious bit of overacting belongs to Brad Renfroe, though I blame the director.  As opposed to sympathizing with him, his yelling and cursing tantrums made me want to slap him.  He was way over the top.3)  The movie was sheer formula; predictable, familiar.  Little kid takes on the evil and\/or incompetent adults - and, of course, wins.  Throw in the rediculously cliche mob wiseguy, the slick media-savvy DA, the good-hearted, smart-as-a-whip, beautiful female attorney, the wise, self-confident unflappable southern judge (black, for good measure), and the secretly menacing cop, and voila!  It's basically a 60's Disney movie on steroids. The cute, snappy repartee between the lawyer and the DA, wherein the (female, of course) 2-years-out-of-law-school domestic relations lawyer goes toe-to-toe and holds her own with the powerful, iron-fisted DA, typifies this movie.Judging by the vast majority of other comments, I can see that most people weren't as put off by this rather typical John Grisham-Hollywood concoction as I, so it must be entertaining to a large audience, but please don't confuse it with good cinema.

Harry's van looked like a huge dog, because he used to be in the dog grooming business. They stop at a roadside diner and make friends with a trucker named Sea Bass.

So he does the only sensible thing to do trade in the van for a mini-bike that get's 70 miles to the gallon. On to Aspen!       They make it and again are down on their luck, until they realize Mary's briefcase was full of $$$! They go on a wild spending spree and run into Mary at a fancy party. Harry goes skiing with her the next day while Lloyd waits for her at the bar. Harry had told him that she would meet her there. Lloyd was heart broken she didn't come, so he played a joke on Harry for making up the story laxatives in his cocoa. Pretty soon, Harry, Lloyd and Mary are held hostage by Nicholas Andre, the rightful owner of the briefcase.Before long, he's arrested and it turns out Mary was married. So Lloyd and Harry leave Aspen and try and find luck someplace else. They may just catch a break.         Pretty funny movie! I heard constant rumors that there would be a sequel. Something like Dumb, Dumber & Dumbest, but haven't seen hide nor hair of it in eight years. There was a dull Saturday morning cartoon version of the movie the following year. Didn't last too long. It was part of an Animating Jim Carrey routine where they made animated series' of Ace Ventura and The Mask. The Mask was drawn the best.

I watched the movie yesterday expecting to see the horse, Pilgrim, as he recovered slowly with the aid of the horse whisperer, Tom Booker.  I thought the movie was going to be centered around the horse.  I thought the people would not play as big a role as Booker and Pilgrim would.I was completely wrong.First off, the movie starts out like it should.  Nice introduction to the characters, very realistic (and quite frightening) accident scene.  The horse, Pilgrim, and his rider Grace are shown riding within the first five minutes.  What you'd expect, right?Spoilers are coming.Everything slowly goes downhill after that.  Grace's mother, after the accident, tries to get Mr. Booker to come up to New York and, after failing, takes a road trip with Grace and Pilgrim to Montana.  The road trip sucks up a lot of time in the movie, where we hardly see the horse.  The introduction of Booker is even longer, and when he finally began helping Pilgrim, I breathed a sigh of relief.  Maybe the movie would take a turn for the better.Wrong again!  It goes even slower after that, with scene after scene involving only the ranchers and Grace and her mother.  Soon we can see something evolving between Grace's mother and Booker.  I began to realize that I was cheated, that The Horse Whisperer was nothing but a romance with some horses thrown in.It takes even longer to finally get to the final training session of Pilgrim, which by that time the movie has gone on for two and a half hours.  I sit and watch and wait and find that the climax does not really involve Pilgrim and Grace, but Grace's mother who must make a final decision about her family.  Although I applaud her final decision, I cannot applaud the charming, misleading appearance of this movie.It may have been a good romance, it may have not.  I'm not much into that genre, so I really couldn't tell you.Sam Neill greatly lifts up the movie.  Although he is hardly in it, he is probably the best actor that was casted for this movie, and puts on an excellent performance.  We could expect no less from Neill.The music, by Thomas Newman, is not disappointing, but I wouldn't go out and get a soundtrack to The Horse Whisperer.  The music fits perfectly, with a nice, calm, sometimes mysterious atmosphere, that seems to blend in perfectly with the mood, setting, and characters.But the movie is so utterly boring and misleading that I would not recommend it to even the greatest of horse lovers.

I was only 14 at the time, and not old enough to see it legitimately. I sneaked in with a friend up the emergency exit of the local Odeon in Swindon and sat through the film wide eyed, the highlight being of course (being a hormonal lad) seeing the beautiful Britt Eklands knockers as she danced about.The film left a lasting impression on me and I had never forgotten it (or Britts tits).Then last month I saw that the movie had been brought out on DVD, together with the Directors cut. I purchased it straight away and watched the longer version that night. All the memories (or was it mamories) came flooding back and I watched entranced as the film unfolded. And what a great movie it is to!I won't go into details about the plot as it's been well documented here, but just to say my wife, who had never seen the film before, just couldn't believe the ending! She loved it.Christopher Lee, Edward Woodward, Britt Ekland and all the locals who took part acted their socks off and deserve the praise that has been heaped upon them.Small Spoilers-------- Personally I prefer the directors cut of the film.

His greatest achievement was to extend the Hollywood golden age, which in so many respects reached its natural end in the 'fifties into the early years of the 'sixties.  Admittedly Hitchcock was still around, but Hitchcock was a legendary figure and far from spent as The Birds and Marnie were triumphantly to prove.  But Frankenheimer was a comparatively new talent with a very special gift for the conspiracy\/political thriller.  He gave us two superlative films in this genre, The Manchurian Candidate and Seven Days in May.  Thereafter his work became increasingly more uneven although there were some good things in The Train, a French resistance wartime thriller and Seconds an interesting but overlong piece of science-fiction.  I have always dated the eventual demise of Hollywood as we knew it from the release of Peter Yates's Bullet in 1968, a film in which the superficiality of a spectacular car chase was the raison d'etre rather than character.  It was sad that a director as talented as Frankenheimer joined the cheap thrills brigade with The French Connection II after which we rather lost sight of him.  Still, at least we can continue to derive enormous pleasure from The Manchurian Candidate, a conspiracy thriller about Cold War intrigue that has never been equalled, much less surpassed.  Others such as Arlington Road and The Parallax Factor are just light years away in comparison.  Just to hint at a plot so diabolical in its concept and implications would involve so many SPOILERS that is is best to leave it alone and simply say that it has the most fiendishly cunning villain in film history, a wonderfully witty script (that reference to a sauce bottle and the consequences of a character thinking he has been told to jump into a lake), an exquisitely tender romantic interlude - almost a film within a film - of a summer when an unlovable character become lovable, the finest performances Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey and Angela Lansbury ever gave and a superlative score by David Amram, all of which add up to one of the most entertaining films of them all.

Samuel is named Rocky, for he is as strong and cool as granite rock; Jeffrey was named Colt because he's as fast as a horse; Michael was named Tum-Tum because his spirit begins and ends with his tummy, and also because he's a compulsive eater. Always has something in his mouth.            The boys' father, Samuel Sr., is an FBI Agent, tracking down super criminal Hugo Snyder. Snyder and Mori used to be partners a long time ago, but Snyder was the evil one. Snyder plans to have Samuel'skids kidnapped, so he hires three outside guys Fester, Marcus and Hammer. Three bumbling surfers.            The boys prove to be masters at basketball and even show their three captors the error of their ways in a very funny scene! But then, unfortunately, they are kidnapped.          Colt has lost confidence in Grandpa, until he comes to their rescue. He takes on Snyder one on one. It was a close call, but Snyder is defeated and our story has a happy ending.         This movie is pretty funny. I like the scene where Fester,Marcus and Hammer break into the boys' homes.

I've seen the original Sabrina with Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart, and William Holden and I have to say that this version does not at all compare. In fact, this version has me wondering if the filmmakers even saw the original.**********SPOILERS**********The movie has so many flaws that I can point out more than just a few. In the original, Sabrina goes to Paris to study cooking and the night before she leaves, she tries to kill herself. In the hideous remake, she goes to Paris to work for Vogue (I know the story had to be slightly updated, but this is ridiculous) and there is no suicide attempt. Also in the original, Audrey Hepburn portrays Sabrina with a certain confidence and certainty, while Julia Ormond's performance makes Sabrina more neurotic and overanxious than ever. The filmmakers also thought it fit to destroy the character of Mr. Larrabee and to make his wife (now a widow) a representative of the company. Lastly, while the ending in the original leaves much to the imagination- ending just as Sabrina and Linus meet on the boat, the remake decided to take it a step further and create about 10 minutes of dialogue between the two actors. I cannot stress enough the dismay I felt while viewing this cinematic disgrace. If you want the real story, stick to the black and white classic because a remake is not always better.

In 1971, a high school in Alexandria, Virginia, is integrated.  Coach Boone (Denzel Washington) is brought in to replace Coach Yoast (Will Patton), who becomes the assistant.  Neither coach is very happy about this situation. Coach Yoast doesn't want to be demoted, and Coach Boone doesn't want to demote him. Many of the white players threaten to sit out the season, because they don't want to play for a black coach.
