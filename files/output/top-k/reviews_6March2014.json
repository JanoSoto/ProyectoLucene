This is a curious tale of love and romance tied in with a typical medieval\/dark ages animal based curse. A form of witchcraft cast upon two young lovers by a man of the cloth, a Bishop, simply out of jealousy. A Romeo and Juliet style historical fable.First thing that will hit you with this film are the striking visuals. The story is set in central Italy (I presume) and there is a very real historical grandiose feel to everything you see. All the scenes are set within (or around) real locations, real castles, real towns, real ruins, real old courtyards etc...The visuals are HIGHLY stylised believe me! every shot is incredibly slick and glossy looking, one could coin the term 'historical scenery porn'. Everything looks like a beautiful living water colour painting with stunning sunsets, dawns, dusk's and twilight's set against some jaw-droppingly lush European countryside and rustic ruins villages and fortresses.Admittedly the one draw back about the visuals are they look too clean, almost too good!. I know this is a fairytale of sorts, a fantasy, but there doesn't really appear to be any dirt or mud anywhere hehe. All the buildings are spotless, the countryside is perfect, every character is dressed immaculately in clean attire, the horses have gleaming coats etc...It all has a lovely dream-like quality but I just felt for the period some grubbiness was required.The other main thing that will hit you is the strange choice in musical score. I'm sure most would think an orchestral score would be fitting for such material, but no, Donner goes down the 'Tangerine Dream\/Legend' route with an 80's electronic rock based set of tracks. There are of course some more traditional tit bits in there but most action and fantasy moments are accompanied by this odd rock score. The problem is the visuals and general style in this film are so good and authentic the score just doesn't sit right in my opinion, it feels a bit cheesy and ruins the classical approach. I'm guessing the film 'First Knight' may have pinched this idea, thing is that film didn't have the spectacularly lavish locations, good cast, slick camera work, timeless story...OK that film was just crap.I think this film also has some great casting. Both Hauer and Pfeiffer really do look stunning with their big blue eyes, makes one feel quite ordinary and pathetic. Hauer really is the true knight in shining armour here, the real Prince Charming...OK maybe not in shining armour but instead uber cool pitch black...errr armour\/Jedi robes kinda thing. Typical heroic attire with a sweeping black cape with posh red lining, this guy looks quite wealthy. With his blonde hair, blue eyes and atop his black steed he really does look very handsome, first time in awhile I can genuinely honestly feel comfortable saying a bloke looked attractive, I was envious.On the other hand Pfeiffer has this ethereal-like beauty with her lovely short blonde locks, pale skin, strong facial structure and yet more big blue eyes. She truly looks angelic, the perfect Princess or damsel in distress for Hauer's brave knight, together they really are a perfect match and I really could believe the fact they turn into a wolf and hawk at their respective times (Ladyhawke...speaks for itself right). Unfortunately the film is let down by the one casting of Broderick who is a stain upon this gorgeous film. He is truly annoying with his constant nervous ramblings in that squeaky voice of his. I just wanted to slap him across the face every time he made those idiotic expressions of shock or surprise...good God!.The plot does take a bit of getting used too, Hauer as a wolf by night and Pfeiffer as a hawk by day, it also takes time to explain this which is a bit confusing. There are no horrific mutations or transformations though, its all done with subtle fades and nice eye close ups which works well. Overall I did get the impression the plot was stretched out a bit because there wasn't much to actually do, the aim of the game for Hauer is kill the Bishop who cursed them. Not much more to it than that so I think there is filler or padding here and there, it can feel dull in places. You could say its all style over substance I guess, but that would be harsh methinks.Overall the film looks exquisite and is very realistic to reality, even if it is too clean to actually be reality. Everything and especially Hauer and Pfeiffer are period perfect, the pair look like characters from a classical fresco or mural come to life.

It does neither of these things well, and also fails to be a good movie of its own.The biggest issues I have with the film are the characters and the actors portraying them. Fred is now just a self-centered douche, and Freddie Prinze Jr. expends pretty much no effort playing him. Sarah Michelle Gellar isn't actually a bad choice to play Daphne, and she tries to do the best with what she has, but unfortunately she doesn't have much. Daphne's whole damsel in distress thing is played up way too much, and her constant complaining is also overdone. Velma's problem is completely opposite to Daphne's, they actually got the character's personality pretty much spot on, but Linda Cardellini is far, far too hot to be Velma. Putting glasses and an orange sweater on her is supposed to make her the unattractive nerd of the group? Scooby's personality is fine, but the CGI work done to create him is just awful. Clearly they were trying to make him cartoony (as he is an anthropomorphic dog), but it was executed very poorly. I haven't one bad thing to say about Shaggy though, they nailed his personality and Matthew Lillard is perfectly cast.Source material is not a sacred thing, and I'm all for changing it, especially with a source as well known as Scooby-Doo, as so many people are already familiar with it, there's more opportunity to toy with it. But the changes they made just aren't good in my opinion, I wouldn't have had an issue with the character's differences in personality from the cartoons if eitherA. The movie was a straight-up parody of the cartoon like The Brady Bunch Movie.B. The changes were funny and kept the characters likable (as Daphne and Fred weren't) or believable (as Velma being a nerd when she's such a fox isn't).The story is pretty weak. I'm not against including real monsters in the films rather than the man-in-the-mask thing the cartoon always did, and the first three direct-to-video animated Scooby-Doo movies (Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island, Scooby-Doo and the Witch's Ghost, Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders) all had the gang encountering real monsters, and all of those were great, but this movie just executes it badly. The monsters themselves look absolutely awful, the CGI used for them is even worse than Scooby. Making Scrappy-Doo the villain behind it all was a very stupid idea, but it's an aspect I wouldn't have minded if the movie was just an outright parody of the cartoon. Old Man Smithers, the man dressed as the Luna Ghost in the opening, was originally supposed to be the villain, and this would've been far better.

","genre":null},{"date":"6 March 2014","score":"","review":" This movie can't seem to decide whether it wants to parody the Scooby-Doo cartoons or just be an adaptation of them. It does neither of these things well, and also fails to be a good movie of its own.The biggest issues I have with the film are the characters and the actors portraying them. Fred is now just a self-centered douche, and Freddie Prinze Jr. expends pretty much no effort playing him. Sarah Michelle Gellar isn't actually a bad choice to play Daphne, and she tries to do the best with what she has, but unfortunately she doesn't have much. Daphne's whole damsel in distress thing is played up way too much, and her constant complaining is also overdone. Velma's problem is completely opposite to Daphne's, they actually got the character's personality pretty much spot on, but Linda Cardellini is far, far too hot to be Velma. Putting glasses and an orange sweater on her is supposed to make her the unattractive nerd of the group? Scooby's personality is fine, but the CGI work done to create him is just awful. Clearly they were trying to make him cartoony (as he is an anthropomorphic dog), but it was executed very poorly. I haven't one bad thing to say about Shaggy though, they nailed his personality and Matthew Lillard is perfectly cast.Source material is not a sacred thing, and I'm all for changing it, especially with a source as well known as Scooby-Doo, as so many people are already familiar with it, there's more opportunity to toy with it. But the changes they made just aren't good in my opinion, I wouldn't have had an issue with the character's differences in personality from the cartoons if eitherA. The movie was a straight-up parody of the cartoon like The Brady Bunch Movie.B. The changes were funny and kept the characters likable (as Daphne and Fred weren't) or believable (as Velma being a nerd when she's such a fox isn't).The story is pretty weak. I'm not against including real monsters in the films rather than the man-in-the-mask thing the cartoon always did, and the first three direct-to-video animated Scooby-Doo movies (Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island, Scooby-Doo and the Witch's Ghost, Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders) all had the gang encountering real monsters, and all of those were great, but this movie just executes it badly. The monsters themselves look absolutely awful, the CGI used for them is even worse than Scooby. Making Scrappy-Doo the villain behind it all was a very stupid idea, but it's an aspect I wouldn't have minded if the movie was just an outright parody of the cartoon. Old Man Smithers, the man dressed as the Luna Ghost in the opening, was originally supposed to be the villain, and this would've been far better.

I'd always wanted to see this film, adapted from the Stuart Smalley sketches from Saturday Night Live. I remember Siskel & Ebert liking the film quite a bit back in the day, plus the star is now my Senator. And this is actually quite a good film. What's most surprising about it is it's actually quite serious for what it is. In fact, trying to get the serious subject to work while also trying to keep the same style of comedy the sketches had on SNL makes it a little tonally uneven, but I love what they were trying. Al Franken stars as Stuart Smalley, who hosts a cable access show called Daily Affirmations, where he reveals his many problems to his small audience and tries to work through them. As the film opens, his producer fires him. Soon after, his aunt dies so he goes back home to Minneapolis for the funeral. His family is hugely dysfunctional, with many drinking and weight problems. He tries to help. The film takes the problems entirely seriously. I mean, there is comedy, but the family dysfunction is never the butt of the joke. Al Franken is very good and the character is given more subtlety than he had on SNL. Vincent D'Onofrio plays his younger brother, Harris Yulin his father, Shirley Knight his mother and Lesley Boone his sister. Laura San Giacomo and Julia Sweeney also co-star as Stuart's friends.

Even actors, for as successful as they are, they too suffer from breaking what they are comfortable at performing in. Here's a film that not every Stallone fan might see everyday - similarly to that of The Truman Show (1998) a year later with Jim Carrey. This particular role is so far in left field for Sylvester Stallone that it almost seems like the wrong choice. When in fact, it proves that Stallone by far can still back a punch even when he's not pulling a trigger every five minutes.Stallone plays Freddy Heflin, the Sheriff of a small town in New Jersey called Garrison. All seems fine and well with the town and Freddy himself until an incident occurs on the George Washington bridge that connects the New York and New Jersey police departments. After the problems arise, Freddy is challenged on his thoughts and beliefs that he had never considered before. This is where things get interesting and dangerous simultaneously. As time goes on, Heflin begins to dig and as he digs, he discovers that everything is not as he thought.The writing is something to behold here. Directed and written by James Mangold, the same man behind Walk the Line (2005), 310 to Yuma (2007) and most recently The Wolverine (2013), created a screenplay that not only defies the normal typecasts that most actors have, but also adds depth to the main character of Freddy Helfin. If it weren't for any of the background given to Stallone's character, the audience would have no idea about Heflin's past and why he acts the way he is in the movie. When it is revealed though, it's a heartfelt story that contains a lot of emotion. Even more interesting is how little Stallone uses a gun. Not only is Stallone overweight but he barely even raises his voice - which is rare. The character of Heflin is very self contained and covers it up well.Also playing a role that is out his usual casting role is Ray Liotta. For anyone who's not familiar, Liotta frequently plays scumbags and creeps. A good example of this is from Unlawful Entry (1992) and a bad example is from Turbulence (1997). But what wasn't seen coming was Liotta playing not only a supporting character but also a tactical one. There is one scene where he explains to Stallone's character how he should take on convicted felons and the advice he gives is extremely noteworthy. Liotta, you should be doing this more often my friend. Along with him are Harvey Keitel, Robert De Niro, future director Peter Berg, Robert Patrick, Noah Emmerich from The Truman Show (1998) (how coincidental!), and just for laughs Mr. RoboCop 3 (1993) himself, Robert John Burke. All the actors, even the ones not mentioned do a fine job.What also makes this movie a fish out of water role for Sylvester Stallone is how human the story makes him look. This isn't a movie where Stallone mows down villains with a rapid-fire gun without taking any hits. Stallone's character is flawed and limited, humanizing him for the entire running time.

Even actors, for as successful as they are, they too suffer from breaking what they are comfortable at performing in. Here's a film that not every Stallone fan might see everyday - similarly to that of The Truman Show (1998) a year later with Jim Carrey. This particular role is so far in left field for Sylvester Stallone that it almost seems like the wrong choice. When in fact, it proves that Stallone by far can still back a punch even when he's not pulling a trigger every five minutes.Stallone plays Freddy Heflin, the Sheriff of a small town in New Jersey called Garrison. All seems fine and well with the town and Freddy himself until an incident occurs on the George Washington bridge that connects the New York and New Jersey police departments. After the problems arise, Freddy is challenged on his thoughts and beliefs that he had never considered before. This is where things get interesting and dangerous simultaneously. As time goes on, Heflin begins to dig and as he digs, he discovers that everything is not as he thought.The writing is something to behold here. Directed and written by James Mangold, the same man behind Walk the Line (2005), 310 to Yuma (2007) and most recently The Wolverine (2013), created a screenplay that not only defies the normal typecasts that most actors have, but also adds depth to the main character of Freddy Helfin. If it weren't for any of the background given to Stallone's character, the audience would have no idea about Heflin's past and why he acts the way he is in the movie. When it is revealed though, it's a heartfelt story that contains a lot of emotion. Even more interesting is how little Stallone uses a gun. Not only is Stallone overweight but he barely even raises his voice - which is rare. The character of Heflin is very self contained and covers it up well.Also playing a role that is out his usual casting role is Ray Liotta. For anyone who's not familiar, Liotta frequently plays scumbags and creeps. A good example of this is from Unlawful Entry (1992) and a bad example is from Turbulence (1997). But what wasn't seen coming was Liotta playing not only a supporting character but also a tactical one. There is one scene where he explains to Stallone's character how he should take on convicted felons and the advice he gives is extremely noteworthy. Liotta, you should be doing this more often my friend. Along with him are Harvey Keitel, Robert De Niro, future director Peter Berg, Robert Patrick, Noah Emmerich from The Truman Show (1998) (how coincidental!), and just for laughs Mr. RoboCop 3 (1993) himself, Robert John Burke. All the actors, even the ones not mentioned do a fine job.What also makes this movie a fish out of water role for Sylvester Stallone is how human the story makes him look. This isn't a movie where Stallone mows down villains with a rapid-fire gun without taking any hits. Stallone's character is flawed and limited, humanizing him for the entire running time.

At the time over 30 years ago, I was no exception. But yesterday afternoon on February 5, 2014 at about two-thirtieish P.M. I decided to watch Superman III on HBO to see if my opinion changed, especially since I had forgotten some movie scenes. You know, Superman III was much more palatable and enjoyable the second time, even though its overindulgence in slapstick and pratfalls keeps it from occupying the lofty perch of the first two Superman movies.Superman III is preoccupied with the insidious threat of technology and computers, and tycoon Ross Webster's (Robert Vaughn)'s insatiable desire to exploit them, with the somewhat reluctant help of unexpected computer whiz Gus Gorman (Richard Pryor), to become still wealthier. Of course, only Superman (Christopher Reeve) can thwart this ambitiously global plan. However, three events complicate matters. One is the kindling of an unexpected romance (as Clark Kent) with Smallville High School prom queen Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole) at their high school reunion. A second, minor one is uncouth former high school football hero Brad Wilson (Gavan O'Herlihy), Lana's jealous ex-beau. The third and most formidable event is artificial, impure green kryptonite. Manufactured at Webster's bidding by Gus to kill Superman and thus stop his interference, instead it unleashes his darker, selfish impulses. Can Superman overcome these obstacles, plus a gigantic (and possibly sentient) supercomputer designed by Gus for out-and-out world domination? As I mentioned, Superman III goes overboard a bit with the physical comedy (and Pryor's hapless blundering and improvisational schtick as Gus) and seems poised to trivialize the kryptonian superhero. But Reeve, as both Kent and Superman, maintain things on a dignified but touching keel, handling sweet romance, outrageous disasters, and planetary threats with a nimble mixture of seriousness and self-deprecation. In other words, Superman never becomes a joke. Even when the ersatz kryptonite and the pleas of Lana's son Ricky force Superman to confront his malicious Hyde-like alter ego in an externalized, knockdown, junkyard battle for his soul, it somehow rises above absurdity to a gripping psychological revelation even a Superman has his demons. Furthermore, Superman atones for his misdeeds (not really so much felonies as mischievous misdemeanors) like pushing the Tower of Pisa back to leaning position. Furthermore, besides the supercomputer, Superman III has its share of disasters for Superman to tackle, like an explosive chemical plant fire, tornado, missile assault, and female cyborg.Perhaps the only true flaw in Superman III is its position in the series. Maybe it should have been the second one, since the first movie does have its comedic pleasures and was just beginning to test Superman and Superman III could have been a more logical extension of the first, leading to a crescendo to Superman II where Superman's powers were tested to the limit. Entertaining as Richard Vaughn's greedy CEO was, it might have been better to retain Lex Luthor in the corporate role to keep the continuity going and employ a delectable teaming of Gene Hackman and Richard Pryor. While I'm making Monday morning quarterback suggestions, perhaps Brainiac and red kryptonite (which has unpredictable effects on Superman) could have found their way into the plot. It's just speculation.The simple point is is that Superman III is not quite ridiculous as it seems, mainly because Reeve believes in both his Clark Kent and Superman personas and helps both personas reasonably rise above the outlandish doings.

Midnight Express tells a story about an American drug smuggler that gets caught while arriving on Turkey, and after that, things only go worse. There are some strong scenes that prove how professional are the director and Brad Davis, such as Billy's hearing on court. Also, the scene in which he turns everything upside down and beats Rifki up proves, clearly, how far people can go in a despairing situation. The cast, made mainly of local actors, helps bringing reality into the flick, since everyone seemed to be truly Turkish. The homosexual scene, however, didn't feel very elaborated to me; they are just normal friends, and all of a sudden, they end up kissing in the shower. Maybe that lack of explanation was due to the fact that sexual diversity was a HUGE taboo in the seventies, so I won't be that critical about it. For some moments, I considered it to have the plausible plot that The Shawshank Redemption wasn't able to, and it feels unfair that such movie is on top of IMDb's list, when this one is barely known world widely.

However Freddy wants more than to just killing people in their dreams so he tries to take possession of Jesse to continue his massacre in the real world.The film is poor and nowhere near the standards of the original, however I suppose you have to watch it if you want to watch them from the beginning however I do warn you, this film is not a great one but I will say this it is better than NEW NIGHTMARE which was released in 1994\/1995 because that my friends was absolutely dreadful.**\/***** Poor ","genre":"Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"6 March 2014","score":"","review":" ...just want to start off by saying Miss Jamie Lee Curtis just looks gorgeous as always though Wanda will always be my favorite character....finished watching the movie about ten fifteen minutes ago and thought it was a worthwhile watch especially on Blu-ray.the movie was very enjoyable even without the horror element. the setting was gorgeous whether it was man-made or natural. it is sort of hard to explain for me but the movie was very well handled by the makers of and it showed. it did not feel cheesy or cheap. i am just a sucker for night scenes and scenes with water in a horror or thriller and this movie did not disappoint me.the horror elements were as well done as could be expected for those days and was probably considered top notch then. the horror story was pretty refreshing and done pretty well and i loved the fog..., it looked so cool rolling around and whats hiding in them. the movie just had strong production values all around and the cinematography was oh so beautiful...i give this Jamie Lee vehicle a 7. very good horror movie.

It seems to be s common understanding with most reviews I have read here that this film is something that has a periodic and contextual feel to it. and if you are not within this small window of opportunity you don't seem to understand it. The period was the 90's rave scene, but too many people get transfixed by the drug taking the rave music, and the lack of plot and substance to the characters. Get real peeps, it is what it is, it shows five people with everyday problems, tedious jobs like most of western society letting loose and going out and letting loose allowing there mind and body to expel all the boring mundane rubbish that has built up over the week, (you know what I'm talking about, some people drink, smoke, eat, read, have sex, etc, etc) Yes it is what it is and I loved it because I lived it. all those that didn't oh well, you're loss, and you can tell who did and who didn't due to your low ratings, its a shame that you are gonna spend life so opinionated about these type of film and you're gonna die a stiff. Sit back roll a joint, take a pill and see where it takes you, you never know you may enjoy it. as your chosen drug of realty seems to be a little tedious and boring.

My sides were hurting (literally) from laughing so much. The comedic timing was dead on perfect. This is a film any new comedian should watch to get an idea of how old school comedians work the timing, the camera, and each other to create a masterpiece. Let's start with the main players. Wilder, Boyle, Feldman, Kahn, Leachman, and Garr....What a fantastic troop of actors\/comedians who worked so well together. But it didn't end there - the minor roles weren't spared as far as talent. Mars, Haydn, and the rest added that those extra zings that made the movie what it is - pure genius. Brooks was able to put this all together to make a movie you can't miss.
