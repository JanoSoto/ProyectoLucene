Struggling to make it through on a daily basis on the urban streets was never an easy task. His sluggish yet innocent personality made him an obvious target to individuals who wanted to take advantage of him. For all that, everything would change when he went toe-to-toe (twice) with the latest heavyweight boxing champion Apollo Creed. Even after the first fight, Rocky had become nothing short of legend. As for the rematch, it was what solidified his image as the rising star that he was. Rocky (1976) and Rocky II (1979) are the two films that book-ended this story so nicely. Of course there would be a continuation that would be in the form of this feature but did it maintain the same level of quality? It's there, but not as much. It's still a well-made and captivating entry but it lacks the substance that made the first two so gratifying to see.The film begins like it did with its first sequel by recapping the finale of its predecessor and showing how much of a beating Rocky could really take. After winning the title, Rocky then becomes engrossed in his fame by covering promo ads, photo shoots, celebrity show cameos and interviews. Despite this, Rocky ends up confronting a new opponent named Clubber Lang (Mr. T) and discovers he may not be as prepared as he thought, so Apollo Creed returns to get Rocky in shape one last time. As for Stallone's direction on how he wanted Rocky to develop as a character, the idea was absolutely fine. When someone becomes famous and is offered riches beyond their imagination, who wouldn't indulge? The lesson behind it all is that you can't let your guard down, no matter how comfortable you feel. Nonetheless, Stallone's writing misfires a number of times in compensation for his directing.The problems in the screenplay are that unlike its forerunners, there are a couple of scenes that do not add any meaning to the story at hand. Right at the start, Rocky has to confront his Brother-in-law Pauly (Burt Young) about his reckless behavior. Turns out that Pauly is jealous over Rocky's fame, yet the matter is resolved all within the same scene. Another is the charity match between Rocky and Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan). There's nothing wrong with this match up; who wouldn't want to see it? But the fact that it did not move the plot a long in any way other than for the spectacle of Hogan Vs Stallone had no use. These kinds of instances are wasteful. Meanwhile, the audience could have had more sentimental scenes between Rocky and his family. That's not the case though. The audience barely views any family time between Rocky, his wife Adrian and young son.Instead, fans see Pauly constantly complaining and Adrian saying almost nothing important until close to the final act. Along with developing Rocky and his family, his opponent Clubber Lang receives little treatment either. It's hard to say if Clubber Lang's personality is actually Mr. T being himself or not. It's also another thing when a character is determined by something, but Lang doesn't seem to have a reason. Lang has hatred so strong that there's got to be more of a motive than just Rocky ignoring his demands for a match. No one holds that much resentment for a reason like that. Lang really just appears to be fuming out of nowhere for very little reason. Burgess Meredith as Mickey, Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed and Tony Burton as Creed's coach were really the only true redeeming character additions. Meredith is able to provide a touching scene with Rocky and seeing Creed and his former coach team up with Rocky is also a plus. This particular element helps humanize Creed and his followers and makes them even more likable as characters.The other remaining components that do work like before were the music and match fights. The way the fights are choreographed still have life in them and keep the sequences moving at a brisk pace as if to emulate how fast the fists are flying. Credit also goes to Bill Butler, who also was director of photography for Rocky II (1979) and Jaws (1975). Also, because this film represents how far Rocky drifted from his original life (living style), numerous shots contain everything from floor to ceiling of glam and riches galore. It's definitely flashy and displays how much wealth Rocky acquired but it's all style over substance (as explained before). The music composed again by Bill Conti did another efficient job. This time when it came to contemporary music of the time, Eye of the Tiger is emphasized more than anything else. Gonna Fly Now is still in there but Eye of the Tiger was given more priority. The Rocky theme is still played throughout as well along with the softer moments that occur. It's still a decent movie but wasn't executed entirely right.Sylvester Stallone had the right idea on how to continue Rocky's story but his screenplay misses the point by including scenes that go nowhere instead of developing all of its characters like the first two films. Mr. T as Clubber Lang was certainly the right choice for an antagonist but he too barely has much depth. The music and fight sequences all still please to a point with Carl Weathers returning but without all of its developed characters, the heart of the story doesn't feel as strong.

While out fighting their rivals, Kaneda's best friend Tetsuo Shima (voiced by Nozomu Sasaki) nearly crashes into a small, odd-looking child. Tetsuo is injured and taken away by government agents, who discover that his brain patterns are very unusual.

The plot follows Kaneda, who allies himself with anti-government forces in the hopes of rescuing his friend and Tetsuo, whose growing abilities begin tearing at his sanity.This film looks amazing. The post-war setting of 2019 Neo Tokyo makes for some truly incredible sights. This is one of those movies where any number of still could serve as backgrounds for your desktop because every little element is lush and detailed. Every frame was painstakingly hand-drawn and painted and you can tell everyone involved consistently delivered their best work. Every frame is beautiful and exciting to see. Populating this world is a story that fleshes out Neo-Tokyo and makes it seem very much alive. While we mostly follow Kaneda and Tetsuo, we also see glimpses of the rest of the population. We find out that there is political unrest between the youth of Japan and the corrupt government, that there is a religious cult following the mysterious Akira, that the youth who are disenchanted with rules and politics roam the streets, fighting each other and joining gangs. You get a glimpse at a world that's very interesting; just enough to get you worried when the climax of the film threatens it all.If you're a big fan of animation and you want to break the stereotype that every animated film is for kids, this would be an excellent choice to show to the uninitiated. If you're not a fan of animation and you want to jump into the format, this is a great spot to go; no silly sequences where a character screams, but only his mouth moves or backgrounds are replaced with streaming lines here. There are some shocking moments of violence and some frightening sequences (mostly Tetsuo's hallucinations as he develops psychic powers) that are the stuff of nightmares. The story is complex, but not difficult to follow (kind of a must for a film that is subtitled and moves quickly) and the characters are well developed, with some nice subtle moments to them. It's all set to a fantastic score that's memorable and haunting, cleverly using vocals (but not necessarily words) and to me, what sounded like an extensive selection of wooden xylophones to generate a primal, haunting melody that hinted at the action that was incoming.It all wraps itself up into an unforgettable climax and the film is filled with iconic moments that once you see, you will recognize in countless other films and stories. The film nevertheless stays fresh and stimulating throughout despite inspiring countless other filmmakers. I'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who I wouldn't recommend Akira to and if you can see it on the big screen, it's an engulfing experience you won't easily forget. Even you, that guy that doesn't really think of himself or herself as a person that likes animation, you have got to see this film. I can't believe it took me this long to finally get around to watching it. It actually makes me angry that someone didn't introduce it to me earlier! You absolutely must get around to watching Akira.

He is then wrongly accused of murder and is pursued by both sides of the law across the country. He then meets a young attractive blonde named Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) and the two of then try to figure out the mysteries and clear Roger's name.This film is one for the ages with it featuring classical scenes that are parodied and nodded at still to this day such as the crop- duster scene and the Mount Rushmore scene. Apart from the classic scenes all the action stands the test of time with the movie being shot in such a great way. Unlike so many movies that came out at the time this did, there weren't any scenes that were cringe worthy and badly made. Every action scene was done to the very best way that was possible at the time.The way the story is told is masterful as you only get glimpses of the truth before you eventually get to know the entire truth at the end. The movie keeps you guessing and that's a difficult thing to do with a movie like this but it's does with such ease and grace that you just fall in love with it. The story isn't one dimensional in any form as what can be assumed as a straight forward 'on the run' movie changes and evolves as the story progresses and you audience rides alongside. The twists and turns of this movie can make your head go for a spin and really makes you wonder who you can truly trust. Roger Thornhill is the everyday person that anyone can relate to who is thrown into this insane situation. He has gone from one minute planning his dinner arrangements, to the next minute running from the law across the country and fighting for his life. With this you really feel connected to the character because you would really wonder what you would do if it were you that was in this situation and if you could do what he has to do to survive.The acting in this film is great from the cunning and sympathetic performance of Cary Grant to the beautiful and disarming performance of Eva Marie Saint. Everybody in this film did a great job with their role that was magnificently written for them. Cary Grant especially does a great job of being the everyday guy whilst still being exceptionally entertaining. He has the dry wit and the smart comebacks that really drive home the fact that you want him to win. Honourable mentions for the best performances go to James Mason who paying the evil and intimidating Phillip Vandamm and to Alfred Hitchcock who couldn't catch his bus.The only significant gripe about this movie is the fact that it ends extremely quickly. The big fight sequence or the climax of the film finishes and within thirty seconds the movie is over. I don't need a 'Lord of the Rings Return of the King' half an hour ending but more than a minute would be nice just to truly settle all the characters plot points instead of rushing it. The ending seemed like it was in fast forward as it moved extremely quickly and made it quite difficult to catch up. Overall North by Northwest is fantastic classic thriller with great characters, action, mystery and most of all a great story. I recommend this film to anyone loves to be on the edge of your seat and loves to tag along to great ride.I rate this movie an 8\/10.

Every action scene was done to the very best way that was possible at the time.The way the story is told is masterful as you only get glimpses of the truth before you eventually get to know the entire truth at the end. The movie keeps you guessing and that's a difficult thing to do with a movie like this but it's does with such ease and grace that you just fall in love with it. The story isn't one dimensional in any form as what can be assumed as a straight forward 'on the run' movie changes and evolves as the story progresses and you audience rides alongside. The twists and turns of this movie can make your head go for a spin and really makes you wonder who you can truly trust. Roger Thornhill is the everyday person that anyone can relate to who is thrown into this insane situation. He has gone from one minute planning his dinner arrangements, to the next minute running from the law across the country and fighting for his life. With this you really feel connected to the character because you would really wonder what you would do if it were you that was in this situation and if you could do what he has to do to survive.The acting in this film is great from the cunning and sympathetic performance of Cary Grant to the beautiful and disarming performance of Eva Marie Saint. Everybody in this film did a great job with their role that was magnificently written for them. Cary Grant especially does a great job of being the everyday guy whilst still being exceptionally entertaining. He has the dry wit and the smart comebacks that really drive home the fact that you want him to win. Honourable mentions for the best performances go to James Mason who paying the evil and intimidating Phillip Vandamm and to Alfred Hitchcock who couldn't catch his bus.The only significant gripe about this movie is the fact that it ends extremely quickly. The big fight sequence or the climax of the film finishes and within thirty seconds the movie is over. I don't need a 'Lord of the Rings Return of the King' half an hour ending but more than a minute would be nice just to truly settle all the characters plot points instead of rushing it. The ending seemed like it was in fast forward as it moved extremely quickly and made it quite difficult to catch up. Overall North by Northwest is fantastic classic thriller with great characters, action, mystery and most of all a great story. I recommend this film to anyone loves to be on the edge of your seat and loves to tag along to great ride.I rate this movie an 8\/10.

He is then wrongly accused of murder and is pursued by both sides of the law across the country. He then meets a young attractive blonde named Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) and the two of then try to figure out the mysteries and clear Roger's name.This film is one for the ages with it featuring classical scenes that are parodied and nodded at still to this day such as the crop- duster scene and the Mount Rushmore scene.

It's still enjoyable, but it certainly lacks the same level of fun and action that we saw in the first Batman. Tim Burton is certainly a dark and unique director, but he toned down his weird style for Batman, this time around, however, he dosen't and it's much darker and creepier than you would want a Batman movie to be, for example, a scene of a woman being pushed out a window falling to her near fatal death and the Penguin biting someone's nose off. He clearly had more power with how the movie was made this time around, but he simply went too far with conveying his own style which dosen't really suit the Batman universe. The highlight of the movie is certainly Michelle Pfeiffer, she is a fabulous actress and performs brilliantly as Catwoman, her scenes are the most memorable as well, particularly her dialogue with Batman. My biggest problem with this movie is the same one I had with the first Batman, but it's more extreme this time around, Batman dosen't have enough screen time and is underdeveloped, the villain has much more dialogue, which wasn't a huge issue the first time around as Jack Nicholson was terrific as the Joker, but I really wasn't fond of Danny DeVito as the Penguin. Villiains normally have a lot of reasons to be likable, but the Penguin was simply creepy and every time he was on screen I was uncomfortable, it was clear that Burton found this character fascinating, but giving him, as well as Catwoman, more dialogue and screen time than the title character is simply odd. It certainly has its flaws and fans of the Batman franchise will probably be disappointed, but Batman Returns is still a very enjoyable movie and I would recommend it as a good action if you ever see it on television. Batman (Michael Keaton) must put a stop to a corrupt mayor and a psychopathic man who calls himself the Penguin, from taking complete control of Gotham.

I completely agree that BATMAN & ROBIN is the literally the worst thing to have ever happened to the Caped Crusader but, if I'm going to be honest, Schumacher's first Batman movie wasn't&#x85;horrible. Maybe it's the nostalgia, but I actually still enjoy BATMAN FOREVER. It was the first Batman movie I saw in theaters, it features two of my favorite villains, and it hadn't quite fallen to the depressing level of camp that its 1997 sequel would bring. It still had major problems but, even now, they aren't enough to ruin my enjoyment. The plot, for instance, feels like something ripped from the 60's TV series as it begins, Gotham is being terrorized by former district attorney Harvey Dent, living under his new criminal persona Two- Face (Tommy Lee Jones). As if Two-Face wasn't enough of an problem, disgruntled former Wayne Enterprises employee Edward Nygma has developed a dangerous new technology capable of harvesting the city's brainwaves and channeling them into his own mind, increasing his intelligence exponentially. Under his new guise as the Riddler (Jim Carrey), he forms an alliance with Two-Face to seek vengeance on Bruce Wayne (Val Kilmer) and discover the true identity of Batman. To battle the double menace, Batman forms a new partnership with Dick Robin Grayson (Chris O'Donnell), a young circus acrobat whose family had been murdered by Two-Face.Michael Keaton had stepped away from the franchise at this point and was replaced in the cape and cowl by Val Kilmer. Kilmer, while amazing as Jim Morrison in THE DOORS, made for a wooden Bruce Wayne. He does little in the way of emoting the entire movie, rarely bothering to so much as raise his voice above a low rumble. Chris O'Donnell joins the series as Dick Grayson\/Robin. O'Donnell makes out best, as his character has the only real defined arc. Wayne has got a minor subplot about coming to grips with his parents' deaths and embracing his role as Batman but it barely receives any attention. Robin, on the other hand, is hunting Two-Face on a personal vendetta. There are obvious parallels between Wayne and Grayson's stories but little is made of it. Nicole Kidman is Chase Meridian, a caricature who exists only to drool over Batman. She's supposed to be a criminal psychologist but you wouldn't know it because, from the moment she's introduced, she spends 99% of her time trying to get into Batman's codpiece. The villains fare better(ish). Tommy Lee Jones wastes an opportunity to make Two-Face into the truly awesome character he should be. Instead, he takes a cue from Jack Nicholson's Joker and cranks it up to 11, cackling and howling through the entire movie. The one character that really worked for me was Jim Carrey as the Riddler. He's definitely got some Frank Gorshin incorporated into his performance, and I loved Gorshin's Riddler when I watched the 60's TV show as a kid. He's way, way, way over the top in a way that only Carrey can do but it (mostly) works and he's a scene-stealer.To match the new campier direction the movie delves into, Joel Schumacher also ditches Burton's grim, atmospheric Gotham in exchange for bright colored lights and neon paint. BATMAN FOREVER is a total tonal shift from the two movies that came before. I loved Burton's visual take on Gotham City but Schumacher's new style never bothered me in this movie. Again, it might just be nostalgia bit I'm willing to give this movie more of a break than, say, the raging pile of disappointment that is BATMAN & ROBIN. BATMAN FOREVER still retains some semblance of a serious attitude about the material and creates a functional balance between zaniness and a grounded reality.

An ant is drinking at a bar and I thought it was a little bit odd for a kid movie, then Sylvester Stallone's character actually says bitchin'. After he says that, I was suckered in and thirsting for more. In Woody Allen's only animated role, he plays a little factory ant named Z who tries to find importance in his life. He falls in love with a Princess and switches place with his soldier friend (Stallone) in an upcoming battle with termites to impress her. Right away, the writing is witty and genius; easily the best writing I've heard in a movie like this, not because of any swearing. The battle is intense and creepy to some. Death is also played about pretty wild. A sole survivor, he returns and kidnaps the Princess. Her fiancé, General Mandible (Hackman) wants to destroy all factory workers, but Z's act of individualism sparks a revolution. Right after watching this, I saw Gene Siskel ranked it as the 7th best movie of 1998. I would also rank it 7th best of the year. It really is that good.

However, in its efforts to turn a medieval wizard & dragon story on its head the movies proves itself to be needlessly dark and depressing. The Kingdom of Urland lives in a constant state of terror because of a 400-year-old dragon named Vermithrax Pejorative and must sacrifice young virgins to it in order to save themselves from a fiery death. Not terribly happy with this deal, the King sends for the last sorcerer to come to the kingdom's aid. What he gets instead is the sorcerer's apprentice. The story follows Galen (Peter MacNicol) who has only limited magical skills, little confidence in himself and all-out hostility from King Even with the help of a young woman (Caitlin Clarke), there isn't much hope for the apprentice, particularly with magic clearly dying out in the world.I'm going to start with the positive aspects of the movie. We have not one, but two characters you can really get attached to and genuinely like. You admire Galen for stepping up to the plate and volunteering to confront the dragon, an opponent who is significantly more powerful than he is but must be stopped. This guy knows he's outmatched so he is forced to use his intelligence to confront the beast, sneaking about its lair, using a mix of conventional and magically-enhanced weapons, and sorcery to take on the dragon. Being young and inexperienced, things seldom go right but he never gives up. Another reason that you like him is because he has to face much more than just the dragon, he has many human opponents as well. The king and his guards, they're total jerks. There are some pretty dark revelations about them that makes you want our young hero to win even more.The other character I really like is the young woman who helps Galen. Her character is essential to the plot because she helps our hero at multiple instances and in fact gets the story moving from the get-go. You would expect her character to be a typical damsel in distress considering the wizard combating the dragon that wants virgins thing, but she's actually a tough character that holds her own and in some ways is much more confident and stronger than our actual hero.I also have to give credit for the film's special effects, particularly whenever you get to see full shots of the dragon Vermithrax. The creature is created with puppetry when it comes to the close-ups (to mixed results) and with stop-motion in the full-length shots. The way the creature is revealed is expertly done, with several shots at the beginning teasing you enough that you want to see more, without showing too much and giving away the best part of the movie (the monster itself) too early. When you do see the dragon, the stop-motion effects used to bring it to life are excellent, some of the best I've seen. It ranks as high as the works of masters Willis O' Brien and Ray Harryhausen. The film also has numerous complex ideas and themes throughout and like I said before, it subverts many stereotypes of the genre so you can't see where the movie is going at any point.That brings me to what works less well with the movie. It's simply so dark. There are so many deaths during the movie that it brings you down. It's not like the deaths I'm complaining about are heroic deaths either, they just feel kind of petty. Sympathetic characters are brutally murdered for no real reason. It's not even to make the villains seem really evil or to add a tragic back story kind of thing, they're just written in to be slaughtered. If the intention was to make the odds against our hero feel overwhelming there was no need to do so. Another major negative point towards the movie is a revelation about Galen's master at the very end. If it had been tweaked just a little bit, where it was discovered by our hero and then implemented by him, it could have been a really clever plot development. To me it felt like a needlessly cryptic revelation that was as bad as those rage-inducing scenes in romantic comedies where the plot could have been solved within 5 minutes if people would actually talk like human beings. It makes you think that a) that wizard was just too lazy to do the whole thing himself b) he really put all his eggs in one basket in hoping nothing would go wrong in this convoluted plan of his and c) that if anyone is to blame because of the fiasco in the kingdom, it's the wizard! The film then ends on a tone that sort of just tells you that your dreams of an awesome, uplifting world where magic, sorcery, beautiful princesses to be rescued and fantastical monsters to be slain by valiant heroes... those are stupid thing to believe in. Get back to reality, because the movie is over buddy!I'm torn with this picture because this is the second time I've seen it and I really didn't like it at first. I thought it was depressing but well made and the ending was bad. I still think that's the case, but there are also many good points and it does make it worth a watch. So here's what I recommend. Watch it once, and think what you want of it, but then watch it a second time, like several months later when you remember the tone of it, but not too many of the details. With lowered expectations and forward knowledge of what happens overall, you will be able to focus your attention on the positive aspects and actually enjoy the film.

One factor Mr. Edwards forgot, however, was that Laurel and Hardy comedies were low budget and relatively short, and brevity and comedy go hand in hand. Epic comedies with epic lengths, such as It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World,' Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines, and The Great Race may have funny moments, but they cannot sustain the laughs throughout their excessive running times. These films were all produced during the 1960's, when big budget roadshow movies were in vogue; overtures, intermissions, and exit music were essential to charge higher prices for reserved seats. Thus, many modest film concepts were inflated to justify special engagements.The Great Race has a lot going for it, however. The charming opening titles mimic lantern slides from the silent era, and the classic cars and flying machines are a delight. The cast is also first rate. Jack Lemmon is Professor Fate, the dastardly Snidley Whiplash of the film, a sneering, mustached villain pitted against Tony Curtis as the Great Leslie, always immaculately clad in white, with teeth and eyes that occasionally gleam. Natalie Wood plays Maggie Dubois, a suffragette who manages to change from one dazzling costume and outlandish hat to another, no matter what her predicament. The stylish costuming also provides running jokes, not only with Wood's eye-popping outfits, but with Curtis's impossibly-white clothes that never get soiled. Although Lemmon is occasionally over-the-top in his dual role as Fate and as a Ruritanian prince, both Curtis and Wood do quite nicely. At times, like the film, Lemmon tries too hard, especially as the Crown Prince. Composer Henry Mancini tries a bit too hard as well; while The Sweetheart Tree is a nice song, by the closing credits, the audience has heard it one time too many.The concept of a New York to Paris automobile race, similar to the plane race in Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines, released the same year, provides lots of opportunity for comedy. However, the plot veers off into a The Prisoner of Zenda subplot that only dilutes the action and provides Lemmon with an excuse to overact. Pie fights and barroom brawls can be funny in the hands of such talents as Laurel and Hardy, but Edwards, obviously blessed with an astronomical budget, attempts to stage the biggest barroom brawl and the biggest pie fight ever. Like Stanley Kramer did with It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World, Edwards tries too hard, and more becomes less. Despite excessive length, The Great Race has enough to merit a look; the sum of its parts is greater than the whole.

AKIRA is one of those films, and it happens to be the first anime film I've ever seen. The setting is 2019 in Neo-Tokyo, so named because of an apocalyptic event which took place 31 years earlier. The rebuilt city isn't too different from what you might find in a post-apocalyptic\/dystopian sci-fi story. What stood out most to me, and the most recognizable elements of this type of story, was the portrayal of a fascist police state where government and those in authority abuse their power and the citizens fight against them. Not only do they show this violence, but there is also a lot of graffiti which provides subtext and context to the overall situation. Some of it went over my head because it's probably specific to Japanese society when this film (and the source graphic novel) were made, but the broad strokes of oppressive regimes, the military-industrial complex and populist uprisings should resonate with most viewers. All of this, and I haven't even gotten to what makes this story unique. At the center of this story is a biker gang, and one of the members, Tetsuo, is captured by a secret military group that studies people with psychic abilities. There is also another group of people who prophecy about the return of some mystical Akira, who will either bring balance or destruction. To be honest, I don't completely understand all of the plot intricacies, but most of the time I was being blown away by the stunning hand-drawn animation. I've never completely warmed up to computer animation, but animated films such as this one have an artistry to them that is second to none (when done right).

Still, it wasn't too distracting like it might be in a live-action film. My other minor complaint has to do with the length of the film.

How this ponderous and plodding film won over Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark will puzzle film fans for generations to come.The plot in post World War I Britain two young men from different backgrounds pursue an opportunity to compete as runners at the 1924 Paris Summer Olympics. One is a wealthy, Cambridge student who runs out of anger at a world he feels does not truly accept him due to his being Jewish and thus it's a world that he constantly wants to best.

It's like when the premise and way the movie was made is written on paper, you think There's no way this is going to work but then it does. I was really surprised with how much this picture affected me emotionally.Kathleen Turner plays Peggy Sue Bodell, who is attending her 25-year high school reunion with her daughter Beth (Helen Hunt). Peggy Sue married right out of high school but now she and her husband, Charlie (Nicolas Cage) have separated. It's awkward enough answering the same questions over and over to the people that haven't seen you in decades but then her husband shows up and things go from bad to worse. She is nevertheless named Prom Queen and accepts the award, but when on stage, she faints. When she wakes up, she discovers that it's once again the spring of 1960. With her memories of the future, she tries to alter her past for the better. The film follows her as she rediscovers who she was at the time and tries to find a way to return to the present.There's something about this movie that really hits home. Travelling back in time and altering the past is a desire that in a way, everyone has. Sure people tell you that they wouldn't go back and fix their past mistakes because those mistakes made them who they are but come on, we all know the day you wake up in your high-schooler's body, the first thing you're doing is buying Baseball cards to stash away, warning people about 9\/11 and meeting Elvis in person, before he gets fat. Peggy Sue seizes the opportunity to do that stuff right away, but then gets side-tracked when she realizes that this trip back in time can be a very emotional experience. With the body of a teenager and the mind of a mother, she reacts very differently to her own parents and realizes how much she missed being a teenager, or being in the same house as her mother, father and sister, or her grandparents (who have in present day been dead for some time). There's something really touching about that and it makes you think back at your own teenage years; if you could go back, who would you be nicer to, who would you appreciate more, who would you stand up to? Yes it would be awesome to return to a time where you could amass money and power, or change history for the better, but there is also something uniquely appealing about just being able to interact with the people from your own past and get a new perspective on what the world was like back then.One of my favorite moments in the film is when Peggy is talking to her then-boyfriend Charlie (Nicholas Cage). This isn't the same guy as he is years later. He's a nervous kid who is doing everything to impress her and is completely in love with the woman. He's anxious and vulnerable too. Check out the scene when Peggy, who now knows the man better than he does finds that she is once again, falling in love with him. She tries to initiate sex with him in his car, but the guy is so taken aback that he refuses and kicks her out. Isn't that what would really happen if you were confronted with someone that was 25 years older than you are, but was disguised as someone your own age? It's little moments like that that really make the movie because it doesn't feel contrived despite the outlandish premise, it feels absolutely genuine.Another element that really helps make you buy into this whole situation are the performances. With excellent costumes and makeup, we have Jim Carrey, Nicolas Cage, Joan Allen, Catherine Hicks and others playing both adults and teenagers and the effect isn't perfect, but the performances sell them. Some of the people I was watching with found that Nicolas Cage as Charlie had a pretty irritating voice when he was 18, but I found that it was very believable that he would have a goofy, nervous voice when he was younger. I'm pretty sure if I looked at any recordings of myself at that age, I would have been pretty annoying too. The actor that really needs to have the spotlight on her is Kathleen Turner, who does a fantastic job. There's almost an implication that while inside the body of her 18-year old self, her mind goes back and forth between the maturity of her older and younger self. She pulls it off not with words, but with subtle changes in her face. Any scene where Peggy Sue is interacting with her mother contains many subtle nuances and although it seems impossible, the 32-year old actress convincingly plays a teenager. It's a spectacular performance and you're an aspiring actor\/actress you need to check it out and study this film so get yourself a good DVD and start wearing out that fast forward and rewind button.It might take a bit of time for you to warm up to it, but there's something really special about this film. I love any story that has to do with time travel because of the moral implications, the possibilities and the dangers that are associated with it. In this case, it made me think about traveling to the past in a whole new way. I still think I'd go back in time to stop Skynet first, but I'd certainly make a point to visit my past because of my experience watching the film. This is the kind of movie that you watch and enjoy both for the technical aspect and the story. I'm eagerly looking forward to seeing it again.

My favorite role of Sellers was the crazy doctor and his German accent. George C. Scott was also very good, as the general always questioning the orders of the President.

When Derek returns on parole after three years of his sentence, his brother David (Furlong), whose doe-eyed puppyish looks bely his own gestating violent racism, is horrified to find that his brother has been reformed in jail and has not only grown back his mane but is determined to redress some of the harm he has done.

Yet American History X's strength is not its subject matter but Edward Norton's ballistic performance. Despite a weak backstory (Derek's rage apparently having its genesis in childhood after a few bigoted comments uttered by his dad, while his equally implausible moral reversal comes from meeting a nice black fella in jail), Norton manages to deliver one of the most convincing racists ever while retaining his character's humanity.

And, in between set pieces, he flounders slightly, though this may be a symptom of the re-edit. Another may be the ending, in which Kaye seems to lose faith with the power of his own movie and delivers what could be seen as a cheap twist in place of a considered conclusion.But in themselves the set pieces are astonishing.

A brutal attack on a convenience store, a gruelling prison rape sequence, and a dinner party argument that erupts into violence are all edited with sustained barnstorming energy.

There might very well be an interesting back story as to just how the characters that Hirsch and Lahti play came to do what they did. I'm surprised a prequel was never made.But here we're concerned with older son River Phoenix who is a mostly self taught musical prodigy and who gets a chance to get a scholarship to Julliard. But he's going to have problems from Judd Hirsch who does not want to see the family unit broken up. That's important to him because it's all he has because of the life he has to lead. Not to mention having to document Phoenix's educational background which has been spotty and under various aliases. Whenever he abruptly leaves and moves to another school the records are always conveniently lost in a convenient fire. Could never use that excuse now with data now all on computers.In addition to which River's found himself a girlfriend in Martha Plimpton the daughter of the music teacher at his latest high school. Some critical decisions will have to be made by him and by his fugitive family.Running On Empty got two Oscar nominations for Best Original Screenplay and for Best Supporting Actor for River Phoenix. This was a breakout film for him, it was the first really serious part he ever essayed in his short life. His roles were as juveniles in teen oriented films before were nice and showed his potential. This one was the first that took advantage of said potential.I always thought that River drew from a vagabond background of his own which made Running On Empty so special for him and for us. His parents were children of the Sixties themselves, the tune-in, turn-on, drop out kind of hippies with a Christian flavoring. They were commune dwellers living in various places off the grid. I'm sure that background also prepared for the radically different part he played in My Own Private Idaho.Still for all the acclaim River got my favorite scene in the film and its climax involves Christine Lahti and her father Steven Hill when they reunite surreptitiously in a restaurant where all the pent up feelings on both sides get to hang out. She's come to ask her father to take Phoenix in and pull some strings to get him into Julliard. We're told he has the juice to do it. Hill is also playing with a lot of conflicting emotions, he remembers how his rebellious teen daughter was holding him and his entire generation personally responsible for the Vietnam War.Director Sidney Lumet put together an impressive cast with an array of impressive performances, each player stamping an individual seal on them.

But a film like Stanley Kramer's Inherit the Wind doesn't call for simplifications. The opening sequence driven by a haunting choir hymn Gimme that Good Old Religion seems to suggest that there's more than bigotry, more than defiance toward Science behind the reactionary trial. And the script, brought to life by two standout performances from Spencer Tracy as the liberal Henry Drummond and Frederic March as the fundamentalist Matthew Brady, provides quite satisfactory answers to a rather complex question.The intelligence of Inherit the Wind' is to confront the two divergent attitudes in a sort of once-and-for-all move the bigots who want the head of the poor teacher (Dick York) versus the atheists who believe that God shouldn't interfere with knowledge. To avoid, with more- or-less efficiency, a partial treatment, there's a crucial character, played by Gene Kelly. E.K.

I suppose the romantic subplot is pointless and its only added value is to show how extreme some reactions get when driven by a feverish radicalism. The priest is corrected by Brady who quotes the Bible, reminding him that who 'causeth trouble in his own house might inherit the wind'. On the other side, Drummond isn't too rough on Hornbuck because he's still his only ally, but you can see that, and that's a credit to Tracy's Oscar-nominated performance, he respects his old pal Brady and his patience with Hornbuck isn't unlimited. Friendship put aside, the conflict between the Bible and Science is never as exhilarating as when these two grown-ups express their rivalries with enraged conviction, one that goes from the crucial questioning the books to the funny triviality of honorific titles. It's one of the greatest battles of speeches in the history of Cinema, the fight of two giants that coincided with another one in France, Charles Vanel and Paul Meurisse in Clouzot's courtroom drama The Truth. The acting from the two 'Jekylls' elevates the conflict to a passionate level. March gets histrionic and over-the-top at times but it's not without reasons, he has the mimics of a man who plays a role. Three-times running for presidency, he sure knows how to use words, to harangue crowds and in the modest town of Hillsboro, he's put in the comfortable position of a preacher preaching convinced people. It's an open-and-shut case and what is left for him is to shine, to be admired, to have the time of his life and ultimately get blinded by his own passion and lower his guard.And Drummond will get him when denouncing the logical evolution of passion emotional fascism, and the censor of rational analysis, the key to all the progresses that made humanity conquer the world. Knowledge has a price and in one of the most brilliant statements ever made in film, Tracy confronts the townspeople to the limits of religion, yes it should be the 'relegere' that reassembles people under a fair law, not the 'relegere' that reads again, lectures on the basis of poetic tales. When March retorts by pleading like a modern prophet, he not only misses Drummond's point but also proves himself totally out of place.After he let Brady unveil his own limitations, a bitter Drummond can finally put Hornbeck in his place by asking him what his ideals were anyway, he who was so eager to trash people of different positions. I'm not sure it worked like Kramer intended to, but the journalist figure was interestingly emblematic of the current attitude toward religion, where in the name of modernity, anything deemed sacred is immediately deemed as archaic and dangerous. Oddly enough, even well intentioned thoughts have lead to such black-and-white judgments and ultimately, clash between different cultures.I believe George W.

Interestingly, a similar story can be told with religion in the accused box and this is how relevant Inherit the Wind is. It's not about what is religious but what is sacred.

One of the Rangers name Rocky, who was the second Red Ranger from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and the Blue Ranger from Power Rangers Zeo has injured his back while training with Tommy and Adam for a charity fighting competition for the Angel Grove Youth Shelter. So Zordon calls the Rangers to find Lerigot, while Divatox travels to Earth and has finally capture Lerigot as well as Bulk and Skull, and the original Red and Pink Power Rangers Jason and Kimberly. The Rangers get new powers, along side with Justin being the new Blue Ranger goes on a quest to find Lerigot and rescue their friends in order to save Earth. The movie itself feels more like watching an extended episode of the show, while the other Power Rangers movie feels more like watching...well...a movie. Nevertheless, I actually do like this movie, and I appreciate it for what it is as it is in the style of a B movie for using practical effects of the Megazord, and other objects. The acting is alright, and I don't need to go into much detail about it. The movie does have some catchy songs along with some exciting action scenes. Also, I don't hate the character Justin for being the Blue Ranger as much as what the haters are saying. That is just my opinion. I do say that I like the movie more than the actual show. Although I would have like it if they ever do a director's cut release to see the Rangers using their Zeo powers for one last time before turning into Turbo Rangers. Also, maybe a bit more on storytelling and some character development. Not a whole lot to say, but I do think the movie is good, but I like Mighty Morphin Power Rangers The Movie more.

One of the Rangers name Rocky, who was the second Red Ranger from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and the Blue Ranger from Power Rangers Zeo has injured his back while training with Tommy and Adam for a charity fighting competition for the Angel Grove Youth Shelter. So Zordon calls the Rangers to find Lerigot, while Divatox travels to Earth and has finally capture Lerigot as well as Bulk and Skull, and the original Red and Pink Power Rangers Jason and Kimberly. The Rangers get new powers, along side with Justin being the new Blue Ranger goes on a quest to find Lerigot and rescue their friends in order to save Earth. The movie itself feels more like watching an extended episode of the show, while the other Power Rangers movie feels more like watching...well...a movie. Nevertheless, I actually do like this movie, and I appreciate it for what it is as it is in the style of a B movie for using practical effects of the Megazord, and other objects. The acting is alright, and I don't need to go into much detail about it. The movie does have some catchy songs along with some exciting action scenes. Also, I don't hate the character Justin for being the Blue Ranger as much as what the haters are saying. That is just my opinion. I do say that I like the movie more than the actual show. Although I would have like it if they ever do a director's cut release to see the Rangers using their Zeo powers for one last time before turning into Turbo Rangers. Also, maybe a bit more on storytelling and some character development. Not a whole lot to say, but I do think the movie is good, but I like Mighty Morphin Power Rangers The Movie more. I give this movie a 7 out of 10.

This wonderful movie opens me up to joy of the time and the love and happiness that can be developed from dancing. The love story between these two gives me chills even after my hundreds of times watching it. Nobody puts baby in a corner will forever be my favorite movie line. I love the emphasis placed on their love without there being too much drama. This love story is filled with passion, romance and strength. I wish there was a sequel! The love that Baby had for Johnny is no longer seen in recent movies. Current love movies only contain love that makes a girl lust over a man. However, Johnny's love for baby is so strong that he is willing to go against his job and her parents.
