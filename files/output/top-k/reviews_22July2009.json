First of all, its fair to say i think, that the first 2 are classics.... Ridley Scott's masterful original and James Cameron's very different but equally enthralling sequel... fast forward 5 years and the concept of another one crops up. Why? In movie history hardly any of 3rd sequels better the originals... terminator, godfather,Halloween, nightmare on elm street, superman, batman,spiderman,scream, shrek, (the only example i can think of is lord of the rings  return of the king, which may well be the best in the series, only because the story came to a phenomenal conclusion), so there would be no reason to suggest that the alien Franchise would or should be continued... but therein says it all... alien and aliens were both very profitable so another one would surely bring em in... and whilst it did just that, the movie itself had so much to live up to it was never going to be on a par with its predecessors. David Fincher is a fine director( seven, curious case of Benjamin button) but the mistakes that were made has lead fincher to virtually disown the movie. so what exactly is wrong with it? by my reckoning, fincher had realised that to make an alien movie to similar to the first or second was not what the fans or even he wanted; so his choice to attempt to do something different from Scott and Cameron was ultimately( as well as the successes of the previous instalments) to blame for the movie not being all that good. killing off 2 major characters right in the beginning was his first mistake,and setting the movie with people you don't really give s damn about, well thats also a error. bar one or 2, we cant really get animated about such unlovely people. 3rdly, a very poor CGI monster which sadly (see first 2 movies for real monsters)takes ALL the suspense out of it, its so obviously fake looking its laughable. combine these three flaws with a dull, leggy (fincher probably wanted atmospheric)direction and lack of suspense or pace and towards the end we actually want it to be over... something you could never say about the first 2. we must forgive fincher his mistakes, he was young and inexperienced.he has matured into an excellent director, instead blame the greedy film company who couldn't resist another chance to make a quick buck and destroying a great horror series in the process.

What can I say? I had to rent it and see it for myself, after all, this was the decade where Eddie was king of comedy. I have to say that my friends were right this was just a really funny and enjoyable movie. We have Eddie as the lead and John Landis directing, there is no wrong. Well, that's wrong of me to say, just love these two guys. But is the movie as good as everyone says it is? I did laugh and have a good time, this was something original for it's time and just had a good time entertaining the audience.Akeem Joffer, the prince and heir to the throne of the African country Zamunda, is discontented with being pampered all his life. The final straw is when his parents present him with a bride-to-be he has never met before, trained to obey mindlessly his every command. Akeem concocts a plan to travel to America to find a wife he can both love and respect. He and his servant & friend Semmi arrive in Queens , New York, and after several scrapes, find an apartment. They begin working at a local restaurant called McDowell's passing themselves off as students. Akeem falls in love with Lisa, Mr. McDowell's daughter, who possesses the qualities the prince is looking for. The rest of the film centers on Akeem's attempts to win Lisa's hand in marriage, while adjusting to life in America and dodging his royal duties and prerogatives.I know everyone loves the line the royal penis is clean but my favorite that had me on the floor is when Prince Akeem has moved to Queens and he's all excited, goes outside to scream good morning to everyone and some guy says F you! and the Prince doesn't realize that it's actually an insult and screams Yes! Yes! F you too!. Trading Places is one of my favorite comedies of all time and I loved that John Landis included the Duke brothers joke into the movie, I nearly died laughing, but there is a flaw in that joke. Unfortunately for those who hadn't seen the movie would not get that joke and John should have taken that into consideration. But I really did enjoy this film, I'm really glad that my friends wouldn't stop teasing me that drove me to see Coming to America, this is the Eddie Murphy that I will always be happy to watch.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"22 July 2009","score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" What haven't I heard about Coming to America, a lot of people in my life have always brought up this movie and rubbed it in my face how they have one movie they could stump me with.

Nowadays, this isn't much of a problem because hit movies are easily predicted, and the masses flock to the best advertised ones like sheep. But Speed was an unexpected success story, and because it made a lot of money, a sequel was put into the works. The result was a film that was vilified by the critics and public alike.I'm honestly surprised that the reviews of Speed 2 Cruise Control are so vicious. While I won't deny that the original is better (a LOT better), the sequel isn't as bad as some people make it out to be. It contains its share of flaws, but it does a lot of things right.After the events of the original, Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) is liking the peaceful life. She has a new boyfriend, Alex (Jason Patric), and he surprises her with a week-long cruise. Someone should have warned him about her propensity for disasters (and NOT just because she's a bad driver). Also on the cruise is John Geiger (Willem Dafoe), a psychotic computer genius with an ax to grind. Shortly after the couple gets on board, Geiger takes over the ship and sets it on a course for disaster.The film's biggest mistake was doing casting Jason Patric as Alex. Keanu Reeves turned down the role to tour with his band, but judging by his performance, they should have offered Reeves more money, or gotten someone else. Patric is awful. His performance is so wooden it makes Reeves, who is not a versatile actor either, look good. At least Sandra Bullock is back as Annie. Annie is adorable as always, and she is used to this sort of thing, so she gets to give a few one-liners, which are pretty funny. As Geiger, Willem Dafoe is great. He's creepy, and not just because he puts leeches on himself. Dafoe is so good that he gives Dennis Hopper a run for his money. Rounding out the cast are Temura Morrison, Brian McCardie, and Royale Watkins.Director Jan de Bont has a lot of fun with this movie, and it shows. He doesn't take this sequel as seriously as the first, so there are a lot more one-liners and jokes. But he still manages to get some thrills packed in the movie, and that's the important thing. One thing I didn't like is that he used slow-motion too much, and in some scenes he has a tendency to move the camera a lot.Speed 2 is not as good as the first movie, but it's still fun!

Of course there are a lot of good points about the film, it goes without saying that the documentary style and use of black and white gives it a very authentic edge, but it still has its fair share of faults.The main problem with Shindler's List is the length. I'm of the opinion that when watching a film less is more and if you are going to do a film that is over 3 hours long every scene should be as relevant and important as the next one. In Shindler's List, in my opinion, there are many scenes that repeat each other, giving us no new revelation or insight into the character's emotions or actions.It was probably Spielberg's intention to show us so many scenes of torture and abuse of the Jews to help show the horrific scale of the events that took place, to show us how many were killed without emotion or reason, but I feel he got too emotionally involved and went over the top, getting to a point where with each random killing he lessened the impact to the audience because you've seen the same thing happen earlier.Another major problem I have with the film is that some parts come off as strangely comedic, which in my opinion completely goes against the idea of the documentary style. Scenes like when Schindler threatens the guards so they help him find his accountant and when Amon Goeth pardons himself in the mirror were extremely ill judged as in my opinion you should not be made to laugh in a film that covers such serious subject matter.The film is also very biased in a sense that it gives all the Jews a personality and character development whereas every single Nazi in the film is shown to be pure evil and mechanical, enjoying every last little thing they did. Obviously I am not saying anyone committing these atrocious acts should be absolved from our condemnation and scorn, however it would have been interesting to see how the bosses of the labour camps would have dealt with guards who actually had a moral compass and refused to act upon these orders of such brutality. Not doing this, unfortunately, takes a bit of credibility away from the film as it makes it seem only those who are wealthy, only Schindler, had any respect for the Jews or were against the war.However, despite its faults there is indeed a great deal of tragic beauty to the film. Apart from the scene at the end where Schindler breaks down and cries, which seemed extremely over-acted and quite awkward to watch, the film really does manage to evoke very real emotions. It opens your eyes to the pain and suffering of the Holocaust and gives you a fly-on-the-wall style view into what happened. When you watch from such a close up perspective it really makes you feel that you are there in the film, someone who is standing by and doing nothing to stop the dreadful events that are happening so close to you. This style really helps amplify every emotion you feel to great effect.A lot of credit must also go to the actors. It is key that in a film like this that you believe what is happening on screen and all the actors do a very good job, especially Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern who really manages to capture the emotions of skepticism and hopeless inevitability flawlessly. Liam Neeson does a really good job as Schindler himself, but lets himself down in the final scene where he is just makes you cringe and think this is acting.Overall I found the film very entertaining, but there were a lot of minor quibbles with it that lessened my enjoyment somewhat along with a few major problems that I feel cheapened the overwhelming emotional experience that I received.

It starts out in a field with two young boys playing in a father's crop dusting airplane. Little do we know that those two boys are going to be a big part of America's victory in WWII. Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) and Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) are Army Air Corp Pilots and best friends. Rafe goes to Britain to fight the Germans, leaving love behind. His plane gets shot down and he is presumed dead. As Danny comforts Rafe's girlfriend, Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), they draw closer to each other. When Rafe turns up alive, the two former friends become enemies. It is through the turmoil of the war that the two are able to reconcile their differences. This film was made to remind everyone of the disaster that America had to overcome that morning in December. It was made to remember all those men that fought and the women that nursed soldiers and civilians back to health. This movie is seemingly aimed more towards the audience that knows little about what actually happened in WWII. Pearl Harbor is not for the historians. It may not follow the events exactly as they happened, but overall it is a good film if we are just looking for some great special effects, fight scenes, a few laughs or a good cry. There were many mistakes in this movie. In some of the shots of Battleship Row, you could see the Arizona Memorial in the background. Also, at the end, the pilots flying Doolittle's Raid crash land in China after running out of fuel.

This film is the only one of the Star Trek films which truly shows what the original TV series was all about.It stars how you would expect with some stuff happening in space, but its abit more than that the opening is of the klingon warships which get wiped out by a strange cloud (I know gripping stuff but stay with it because it does get better). Starfleet then monitor where the cloud is heading...its destination Earth (didn't see that coming did you). And of course its up to our heroes of the U.S.S. Enterprise to save the day. Only trouble is the TV series stopped 10 years before this film.Still all the original cast rejoin the action and they all have some great introductions to get back into character. However the film itself doesn't take itself too seriously all the time, yes there's a lot of serious moments and some of the lines could be better delivered by Stephen Hawking (oh and William Shatner's hair does change length almost ever scene) but this is Star Trek!Anyway as our heroes get back together, no not in a sexual way, they start to explore the cloud. During the scenes inside the cloud their is some excellent effects and also a really good backing track which just makes you get stuck into the film and actually leaves you wondering what's going to happen. I do admit however that these scenes go on way too long in places. Though there is no action in the film its still a good piece of artwork and also has some great lines (most of them coming from Spock when trying to explain most of what is going on).There is however one major thing wrong with this film in that the script is a little boring with nothing going on, it takes almost 45 minutes for anything major to happen, and even then it doesn't really pick up. But regardless its still a solid true Sci-Fi film which you can sit down and watch regardless of what mood your in.

I do admit however that these scenes go on way too long in places. Though there is no action in the film its still a good piece of artwork and also has some great lines (most of them coming from Spock when trying to explain most of what is going on).There is however one major thing wrong with this film in that the script is a little boring with nothing going on, it takes almost 45 minutes for anything major to happen, and even then it doesn't really pick up.

You've seen thousands of them and this one incorporates many of the familiar clichés.Here we have Nicole Kidman and her dog, Benjie. She and her husband, Sam Neil, are aboard their sloop in the Pacific in a dead calm. A schooner is sighted nearby and a man, Billy Zane, furiously rows a dinghy from the immobile schooner to the immobile sloop. The schooner turns out to be a rotting, evil ship, while the immaculate sloop is manned by two hopefuls and a playful dog. The evil schooner is black and the immaculate sloops is white. (I think this is called symbolism.) Zane climbs aboard the sloop, looking as if he's just swum through a vat of schmaltz, and relates this improbable tale of botulism poisoning that left everyone else dead. While he rests, Neil rows the dinghy over to investigate and finds evidence of a journey that ended in chaos and murder.Following the conventions of the genre, Zane wakes up, throws Kidman to the side, and commandeers the boat, leaving Neil aboard the filthy rotten miserable ship of doom. The man in these films must be wounded or too distant to help or, as in this case, both. Nothing Kidman does enables her to outwit or harm Zane. She tries all her wiles including seduction. No dice. That's the genre for you -- the woman in jep must be unable to find safety for herself and her child. There's no child in this movie. That's Benjie the dog's role.Three things happen that not only strain credulity but draw and quarter it. (1) A lightning bolt topples the mast on the evil boat so that it plunges head first into what is perhaps the only critical spot on the boat if you want to trap Sam Neill below decks with water rising to his chin. (2) Kidman tries to shotgun Zane but of course is foiled, so the resourceful babe puts a locked door between herself and the madman while she loads a spear gun. With Zane shrieking and banging on the other side of the door, she pops a spear through it. There is a cry of pain and a trickle of blood through the hole. The pounding stops. What does she do next? Not what YOU would do next. She cautiously opens the punctured hatch and steps through it to look into things. (3) This allows Zane's supposedly dead body to spring back to life. He does it again later. Let me be entirely clear about this -- the same dead body springs back to life two times.I guess I've made enough fun out of this. The criticism is mainly aimed at the clichés that the genre commands, not at this movie, because the movie makes perhaps the most skillful use of these formulaic incidents that a viewer can imagine. The plot misses not a single opportunity to ratchet up the tension and it all works pretty well. A lesser director and less inventive writers could easily have turned out a Dead Clam.Nicole Kidman isn't glamorized. Her beauty is earthy rather than supernal. Her hair is an unsightly mop of long red curls. She doesn't wear any noticeable make up and looks like the fresh-faced eighteen-year-old Australian girl that she was, cherubically plump. Sam Neill has a face that's trustworthy and intelligent. (He was fine as a brooding churchman in A Cry in the Dark.) He's well cast. Try to imagine John WAYNE in this role. Billy Zane is properly maniacal, with his greaseball presence and toothy smile and his adolescent whining about how nothing is HIS fault.The photography is memorable, especially considering the limitations of the setting -- two boats in a calm sea. Only the musical score disappoints. Sometimes it's effectively understated but at other times we get the emetic demonic chanting that could have been ripped off from a dozen other less notable movies. One of the things I like most about this story is that it has no supernatural element. Everything that happens could actually have happened. No devils required.

First off, if horrible things are lurking in Olde London Town, where else would they go but the creaky Underground? Classic location for creepy goings-on, and a realistic evocation of Sixties London; not in the least 'swinging', but knackered and still on its knees after the war and the on-going hardships of peacetime.Secondly, and for my money the best reason to see this movie, is Nigel Kneale's central idea that the lone Martian craft has been down there for millions of years, somehow infecting the location, and giving rise to occult rumours of hauntings throughout history. I love the idea that the street name 'Hob's Lane' has been replaced with the more mundane 'Hobbs Lane' (Like the Cricketer - referring to Jack Hobbs), obscuring the warning from our recent past of the sinister nature of the area, and providing a real clue that Mankind's history and that of the Martians is inextricably linked.So 'Hob' is the colloquial name for the Devil, and when you mention the Devil, up He pops! It's when this film escalates into its 'running and screaming' final act that it loses most of the inherent creepiness that the story has worked hard to achieve, but it's a great fun flick, with lots of memorable ideas, and a perfectly acceptable cast saying perfectly unreasonable things.

I suggest the reverse is the case Peckinpah goes out of his way to show that evil German deeds cannot be blamed on the Nazis, but in fact arise from disturbing elements already present among non-Nazi Germans. Here are several examples When Schnurrbart and Steiner discuss what are we doing here?, they quote from Friedrich Bernhardi, an aggressive German expansionist who wrote before Nazism existed; the most evil character in the film (Captain Stransky) despises the Nazis; the snivelling Lt Driebig has no Nazi connections; Steiner sees both Eva the nurse and the hard-hearted German generals on his home leave as sharing guilt for the war, but there is no indication that any of them are Nazis; in fact, Eva's final words to Steiner are long live Germany &#x96; she is just an ordinary German patriotically doing her bit to support the war; Steiner accuses the cultured (and non-Nazi) Colonel Brandt of being in effect no different to Stransky. We only see one Nazi during the entire film.Peckinpah drives his theme home with the final quote from Brecht Do not rejoice at (Hitler's) downfall &#x85; because the bitch that gave birth to him is in heat again. In other words Hitler is not unique; mass-murderers like him will arise again and find willing allies; and German atrocities would have happened anyway in WWII even without the contribution of the Nazis. The most disturbing part of Peckinpah's theme, is the implication that any culture can give rise to a Hitler &#x96; the next one need not be German.As for the film itself, some of its special effects look very dated now, but the inherent realism more than makes up for this. Classic Peckinpah film techniques are all here, and the juxtaposition of slow mo and different angles combine to give an overwhelming effect of what it is like to be under a battalion assault. The battle scenes are extremely realistic, particularly the manner in which Lt Meyer plans and leads a counter-attack to clear the trench system, and the manner in which the tanks break into the position. There is plenty of humanity shown among both Germans and Soviets. Even the nasty Stransky's character is understandable, and all the more terrifying as a result. I have to rate this film higher than Saving Private Ryan, because whilst the latter has sublime early scenes (both in France and USA), it then descends to that awful clichéd final battle.

The most disturbing part of Peckinpah's theme, is the implication that any culture can give rise to a Hitler &#x96; the next one need not be German.As for the film itself, some of its special effects look very dated now, but the inherent realism more than makes up for this. Classic Peckinpah film techniques are all here, and the juxtaposition of slow mo and different angles combine to give an overwhelming effect of what it is like to be under a battalion assault. The battle scenes are extremely realistic, particularly the manner in which Lt Meyer plans and leads a counter-attack to clear the trench system, and the manner in which the tanks break into the position. There is plenty of humanity shown among both Germans and Soviets. Even the nasty Stransky's character is understandable, and all the more terrifying as a result. I have to rate this film higher than Saving Private Ryan, because whilst the latter has sublime early scenes (both in France and USA), it then descends to that awful clichéd final battle.

reviews, I want to do this movie justice...The pagemaster is made for kids and adults who still dreams, it isn't the most serious movie at all but it does have some spots that has deemed it serious, mostly it is a movie that should be taken lightly.This movie wants us to be taught something like many others of its nature, in this movie we are taught two major things first 1. to take choices and not be afraid, to do things we normally would be a afraid of as a child, second 2. it teaches us the main thing, to believe, simply just to believe, we all know none of this is real but why do we have to disband these movies, they are imagination, fantasy something many today could need a whole lot more of.This movie is also done very good by the actors, they chose the right actors for every voice in the movie, but my favorite is of course Christopher Loyd as the Pagemaster, the one who granted a single wish for a kid who were afraid of everything.The music is perfect in this movie, as it is a fantasy music like this is needed, this is something people and companies have at least kept forever and haven't still forgot, now if only they would do the same for fantasy, for imagination, we all have a child in us, why grow up so fast, we get to be mature but that doesn't mean we have to let go the things that made us into what we are today, many of these movies have been forgotten but they will always stay inside us, so now it is time to say that this movie is all that it is a classic, a classic people just forgot.As I said above I only do reviews of movies I like, not movies I don't

Sirk takes this basic plot and uses it to expose the viewer to many of the conceits and deceits of 1950's Eisenhower-era American society, where despite wearing fancy clothes, talking in cultured tones and living in fabulous houses where the focus every week is on who's throwing the biggest party for the smart-set, the would-be good citizens (including Wyman's own spoiled and self-centred children) of Stoningham betray their propensities to gossip and philander under the cloak of external respectability. It's truly shocking, early on in the film,for example, to see Wyman, a recently bereaved widow, have herself forced upon by a middle-aged neighbour who crudely attempts to set her up for a clandestine one-night-stand.Contrasted against this immoral background chorus is straight-arrow Hudson who exhibits an almost Zen-like inner-peace and tolerance for life and his fellow-man, who with Thoreaux as his Bible and with his particular set of unaffected, avarice-free life-loving friends in tow, takes Wyman on a voyage of sometimes tortuous self-discovery and ultimate fulfilment.Sirk gives us many symbols of innocence, hope and rebirth, sometimes a little obviously (Rudolf the red-nosed reindeer gets a look-in!), representing Wyman's journey back to innocence, away from the decadence and hypocrisy of her so-called friends in society. He also gets in his favourite season Christmas, in scenes which surely inspired a thousand Christmas card designers and even gets in a not too subtle dig against the new intruder in many an American consumerist living room, the dread television.Okay, so there's a little too much sweet home-spun philosophy on the go, Hudson's character, in particular, is just too impossibly good and the ending sappy in the extreme, (at least the trademark next-to-last- reel tragedy redolent of so many Sirk epics is for once a false alarm) but it's beautifully acted by one and all, especially the leads, while the photography is stunningly beautiful, particularly some of the dolly shots looking down on Hudson's recreated mill-house.
