The apes were vulnerable, and that was nice too.There's a section where the scientist calls his daughter on the advanced intercom device to wish her happy birthday and apologise for not being there, probably included by Kubrick to wow us back in 1968 as to what future intercom technology would be like, but it was a nice scene nonetheless, especially the distracted but still attentive nature of the little girl. I also appreciated the way $1.70 was charged for the call, pretty much like pre-paid credit in the modern age.The interior designs of the spaceships were really impressive and beautiful, although the chairs in the Hilton were bizarre. The curved aspects of the walkways, reflecting the round outer design of the spaceships seen from space was a nice touch too, with the interior design, snappy male suits and beautiful air-hostesses with weird hats, a real treat. While eating spacefood slop, each astronaut watched the news on his 1968 iPad equivalent, for example.HAL 9000 was the best part of the movie for me, especially his voice and calm rationale. Fixed camera settings on the red eye, the outline of his computer casing on the panel, in between eight or so flat screens. If you've seen 'Moon' with Sam Rockwell and the computer voice played by Kevin Spacey, you'll get extra joy from the deadpan HAL. The use of display panels in general was a real surprise too, sometimes simplified with a background colour and a single, abstract word.As to the negative.The HAL and character development part of the film was not enough. What should have been a dialogue between crew members concerning gradual suspicion about the motives of HAL turned into a simple let's switch him off because he made a single improper diagnosis. HAL reacts to the threat of being switched off by eliminating the crew instead, which is fair enough from a computer's point of view, resulting in a single survivor eventually getting the upper hand and managing to achieve the desired disconnect sequence himself. I really loved the pleading by Bowman, asking HAL to let him back on board, followed, in contrast, by the pleading of HAL not to be switched off once the tables had turned.The space travel sequences were dull though.

Unfortunately, my cable television placed the movie at the 1230 am slot and on top of it kept no intermissions, not even one during the movie. So I had to stay awake late at night and watch this in the living area, dimming the lights around me and lowering the T.V.'s audibility so that my family would not get disturbed by the warning alarm sounds heard often in the film. Without any intermissions, I was a little lost during the movie because keeping an intermission during films does indeed have a powerful impact if placed at the right point &#x96; it increases the audience's anticipation and also gives them a break to take in all the details.Silkwood kept chugging on and on in scenes with little dramatic weight (its documentary approach is quite like the lead actress Meryl Streep's other film A Cry in The Dark) or any significant narrative development to hold us in. I quite felt like the movie chose the wrong person to tell its story, and it could've been told better had Karen Silkwood been a supporting character in a film that rather emphasized on the investigation of Kerr-McGee plant and the lawsuit in the aftermath of Silkwood's untimely demise. Unlike Erin Brockovich, Silkwood was not able to directly resolve the issue of health and safety of workers, and though she did play a major role in initiating the whole move, her accident martyrs her for a greater cause. The movie isn't able to deliver her enough justice for her efforts and death, with its epilogue only mentioning that the 'plant closed down a year later' &#x96; too grim and defeated to inspire. Karen Silkwood was a courageous small-town gal who took on the Oklahoma nuclear plant where she worked after finding out that it conducted unethical practices without considering workers' safety. From being one of the bubbliest and most beloved persons among her colleagues and supervisors, Karen eventually lost almost everyone's support after helping the union in digging out such malpractices happening at the workplace. Her private life too faced its share of difficulties on top of the mess she was already in even before the incident &#x96; apart from losing custody of her three kids, Silkwood's relationship with her boyfriend Drew also suffered when he cautioned her of 'going too far' with the case. She didn't just have to win her colleagues' support but also prove to the union that she was a smart woman with a sharp mind.In one of the film's best acted scenes, Meryl as Karen is discussing recommendations and proposals for the nuclear plant with the senior union members. At first, her suggestions are trivial and her seniors condescendingly put down her ideas and hurriedly begin to leave. It is then that Karen leaves the room and catches them in the corridor where she whispers what she had witnessed at the plant. It is only then that the union takes her seriously. Streep's excellence is evident during close-ups or mid-shots in this movie's case (the film rarely has close- ups), but her screen charisma tends to disappear in her attempt to replicate human-like performances. And this becomes a problem whenever the camera goes away from her, especially here in Silkwood where the cinematography is quite conventional like those old films where the cameras moved less and the actors went back and forth. She's managed to rectify this problem though especially in her recent ventures where her charisma makes for half the performance. Here we manage to catch less than half of whatever she is doing because of the distance the camera maintains.It's not just Streep but also actors Cher, Kurt and director Mike Nichols who act and direct respectively in a similar manner. Now I get it they wanted to depict a dull small-town in Oklahoma with as much truism as possible. Cher (playing Karen's lesbian friend Dolly) wears the most unimposing crumpled and faded jerseys and pants while Russell (playing Karen's boyfriend Drew) is equally untidy and moves around the house shirtless and in cheap blue jeans (though their performances are great). They do everything in their own lazy pace and Cher's Dolly is found half the time either in bed or on the couch. On top of this Nichols makes it even more evident that nothing much happens in 'small town Okie' by placing his camera at a distance. Only a few times do we get shot\/reverse shots between the actors and once or twice we see the camera do an effect other than cutting (a few dissolves and an expected fadeout after the crucial scene). Even the upbeat background music at the beginning slowly turns into bleak mournful tunes as the film progresses. It is only the sound of the warning alarm bells that occasionally appear to raise some momentum. There is neither enough follow-up of Silkwood's investigation itself, except for some extended scenes of Karen surreptitiously (hence very slowly) hunting for some 'confidential information'. I could get up in between, bring some chocolates from the fridge in the kitchen and find myself watching her do the same action. The movie 'Silkwood' therefore becomes 'ambitionless' and although I do understand it has deliberately downplayed its 'own cinematic ambition' just to honor the woman's life, the movie as a result also becomes 'one of those inspirational films that come, snag some awards and are soon forgotten'. Or in this film's case, used as a failed 'boob-gag' in Seth MacFarlane's unimpressive Oscar show.

I like her as an actress and the film fully benefits from her fabulous performance, gorgeous cinematography and the stylish direction by Jean- Pierre Jeunet. I like these strange, cheerful and uplifting films. Amelie is a wonderful story with weird characters, strange sense of humor and it's very French in all the good ways. It's very well realized style of over substance film and takes full advantage of it. I just loved the way Amelie was shot and directed. I really like it in films when the cinematographer loves their leading actresses and film them with special care and makes them look beautiful. In other words, Amelie is very cinematic looking and makes the generic Hollywood rom-coms look like sit-coms.Audrey Tautou absolutely owns this film with her performance. She is funny, charming, odd and very likable. She channels the same aura like Jun Ji-Hyun but lacks the some of the childlike energy she brought to her performances. The rest of the cast are fine and bring a lot of laughs and some fine dramatic moments too. It's overall well acted film with a great standout performance by Audrey Tautou.Where Amelie falls a bit short is the story and characters. When compared to My Sassy Girl, Amelie falls short in terms of character development and overall story. Yeah, it's funny and sweet but little more depth would have benefited the overall experience. But despite that Amelie in terms of characterization and story is miles ahead of the general Hollywood romantic comedies.Amelie is a wonderful film for adults to enjoy. The story is simple and could be understood by teenage audience as well, but the very French nature of it might not be acceptable for the more conservative parents. To put it bluntly, there is quite a bit sex, nudity and a porn shop. To me, it's an Okay film for general audience as long as you don't get upset about the naughty bits. It's not as smart or well written as Asian romantic comedies\/dramas or even some of the French classics but still it's a very pleasant film to watch.

She is funny, charming, odd and very likable. She channels the same aura like Jun Ji-Hyun but lacks the some of the childlike energy she brought to her performances. The rest of the cast are fine and bring a lot of laughs and some fine dramatic moments too. It's overall well acted film with a great standout performance by Audrey Tautou.Where Amelie falls a bit short is the story and characters. When compared to My Sassy Girl, Amelie falls short in terms of character development and overall story. Yeah, it's funny and sweet but little more depth would have benefited the overall experience. But despite that Amelie in terms of characterization and story is miles ahead of the general Hollywood romantic comedies.Amelie is a wonderful film for adults to enjoy. The story is simple and could be understood by teenage audience as well, but the very French nature of it might not be acceptable for the more conservative parents. To put it bluntly, there is quite a bit sex, nudity and a porn shop. To me, it's an Okay film for general audience as long as you don't get upset about the naughty bits. It's not as smart or well written as Asian romantic comedies\/dramas or even some of the French classics but still it's a very pleasant film to watch.

I like her as an actress and the film fully benefits from her fabulous performance, gorgeous cinematography and the stylish direction by Jean- Pierre Jeunet. I like these strange, cheerful and uplifting films. Amelie is a wonderful story with weird characters, strange sense of humor and it's very French in all the good ways.

I don't really like any of them. Yet, each is excellent in this film.Let me begin with the real star of the film -- Joan Allen. I don't know how I've missed her, but she was wonderful in this film. Jeff Bridges was totally believable as the President! Gary Oldman perfect is his snarky role. And Sam Elliott forceful as the President's assistant. I cannot fault any of their performances, or for that matter of any of the supporting cast.Now, as to plot. Generally believable, although there were some details that didn't set quite right. For example, we all know what the chamber looks like when the President addresses Congress...we see it every year during the State Of The Union speech. Although the President's address to Congress here was quite dramatic and well done, that chamber didn't look anything like the House Of Representatives. And, also near the close of the movie, I have a little trouble believing that the Secret Service would lose the President out on the White House lawn...which doesn't slope, BTW (I lived in the D.C. area)...so the scenes at the White House and Capitol may have been filmed at the Virginia State Capitol).But, these little matters don't detract from an excellent plot that is high political drama, but generally quite believable.Highly recommended.

I can't, however, find many people who like either of the Timothy Dalton films. It's a shame, really, because The Living Daylights, to me, is an underrated gem. It is easily my favorite Bond film since the Sean Connery era, and in some ways, it is my favorite.Why is The Living Daylights so good? The number one reason is action. Out of the top ten action scenes in the Bond series, at least two of them are in this movie. The first is a spectacular car chase with the best Bond car ever, a beautiful sports car upgraded with missiles, skis, spikes for ice, and lasers. (I've had a few option extras installed &#x96; one of my favorite Bond lines). Every other car in the Bond movies, save the one in Goldfinger, is dull compared to this one. The other great action scene comes near the end. I won't spoil it for you, but it is one of the wildest and most thrilling death struggles I have ever seen. When I first saw this film in the theater, there was a mixture of gasps and excited laughter from the audience at the craziness of it. This was, in some ways, a golden age of action scenes in movies. It was when budgets were big enough to do cool stuff, CGI was still ten years off, and directors weren't too lazy to choreograph great action scenes. This movie is an example of how great action can be.The second reason this movie is so good? Gadgets. I already mentioned the car, but Dalton's bond in this movie had a couple of other nice ones as well. I'm always disappointed when a Bond movie doesn't have at least one or two gadgets. They are part of what makes the movies so cool, and what makes every heterosexual male fantasize about being James Bond. Who wouldn't want to have all kinds of little futuristic, secret toys in their pockets?I have never understood why Timothy Dalton didn't catch on with audiences. So he wasn't quite as macho and charming as Sean Connery &#x96; big deal. Compared to Roger Moore the Clown, he was fantastic. He was serious, tough, and dark enough, but he still retained a sense of humor, and so did the movie. Dalton had great range &#x96; imagine Bruce Willis, if Bruce Willis was a classically trained British actor. During the action scenes, he retains a sense of calm and confidence, without cracking a dumb joke every five seconds (but maybe the occasional smirk). That is why the crazy action scenes work so well. I found Timothy Dalton to be way more enjoyable than Pierce Brosnan, and I like him better than Daniel Craig too.This movie had some pretty decent villains, although the plot was unnecessarily convoluted. The big henchman, who Michael Fassbender reminds me a lot of, is one of my favorite Bond henchmen of all time. He isn't just a big brute or a bodyguard. He is also an assassin, with capabilities about on par with Bond. If there is a true weakness in this movie, it is that the Bond girl is pretty weak. Granted, most Bond girls are pretty weak, but this one (other than being very easy on the yes) is kind of a nuisance. She does some retarded stuff sometimes, and doesn't do much besides shout stuff like look out with her eyes wide open.I recently saw Skyfall, and I was thoroughly disappointed by it. Bond movies have fallen so far from what made them so enjoyable &#x96; James Bond uses gadgets, kicks ass, foils the villain, and gets the girl. He doesn't need to be a clown, and he doesn't' need to be a dark, brooding hero either.

The evolution of each movie is so clear that this looks it was a lost episode of the 1960s TV show it was based on.And it feels like it's been that long since I've seen this. I remember disliking it and wrongfully being confused &#x96; I can't see why now, but I never realized how much I didn't care for it. Mercifully and much like the franchise has evolved, the original does get better as it progresses.Only your mission is to get through the first half before the fun begins.The movie opens up with what I'm guessing is 1st year spies. It's one thing to explain to the audience this gadget does this, or causes this harm, but for the characters to act foolish like they know less than the typical non-espionage viewer, is just plain pathetic. Prime example is poor, out-of-place, Kristin Scott Thomas who, apparently, never heard of either the TV program or any spy-film before.Worse than these high school dropouts posing as international agents, is that they kill off the majority of the team within 25 minutes from the start. YOU DON'T DO THAT &#x96; or the original series wouldn't have lasted as long, obviously.And what's even worse than that? (Fast forwarding to the end) YOU DO NOT MAKE JIM PHELPS THE BAD GUY. Seriously? I can see why they did it &#x96; the star, Tom Cruise, wasn't going to play the older, white-haired leader and they (or most likely he) wanted to give the pending franchise to his Ethan Hunt character. Fine, but you still don't make the long-lasting hero the villain. You don't even kill him off &#x96; just make him retire, disappear using his own skills, etc.Anyhoo, the movie focuses a diskette containing undercover CIA operative's names purposely getting into the wrong hands to both capture the bad guys and revealing the double agent. Yes, I said diskette &#x96; the old 3½ inch diskette that probably couldn't even hold the contents of this review, let alone any kind of list as big as described in the movie.I digress. As mentioned, the amateurish crew is dismissed early and Ethan Wake up, Claire! Jim's dead! He's DEAD! They're ALL DEAD! Hunt is blamed. This is where it gets good &#x96; for a few moments. After he meets the fantastic Vanessa Redgrave as Max, he recruits future staple and great Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and short-timer Franz Krieger (Jean Reno) to break into the CIA headquarters and the (at the time) wildly original, tense and fantastic wire-hanging scene takes place.Of course, just so the movie does escalate past the 2 stars I gave it, during the best scene, there's a rat &#x96; REALLY? &#x96; that scares\/distracts Franz in an air duct. Much like the first half of the movie, this makes me feel they weren't taking any of this too seriously, making this just a few steps above Get Smart.Following that, and literally jumping to the end, there's a fantastically unrealistic leap of faith from a helicopter and a super-train in a tunnel that makes me unintentionally laugh every time I see it.The movie made a huge mistake of being mostly spy and very little action, whereas Part II was also wrong at playing the opposite card. Luckily, they *finally* hit their stride with Part III and Ghost Protocol that, rightfully, matched both needed qualities equally.This actually very slow action movie, which does contain a somewhat reminiscent of older spy-films, albeit dumbed down, was just a misstep from fairly decent director, Brian De Palma. It's almost worth a shot, just to find out who Ethan Hunt is and why Jim Phelps doesn't show up in the sequels. It did contain some decent cinematography and a very good score, but overall it's a miss. Thankfully, the sequels, with the exception of parts III and Ghost Protocol, are pretty much stand alone so you don't have to endure this experience.I've been disavowed, says Ethan.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller"},{"date":"26 February 2013","score":"","review":" (This review is heavy on spoilers&#x85;but it's also 16 years old and it's your fault if you haven't seen this yet&#x85;)Perhaps it's unfair to finally get around to re-watching and reviewing the original 1996 Mission Impossible. The evolution of each movie is so clear that this looks it was a lost episode of the 1960s TV show it was based on.And it feels like it's been that long since I've seen this. I remember disliking it and wrongfully being confused &#x96; I can't see why now, but I never realized how much I didn't care for it. Mercifully and much like the franchise has evolved, the original does get better as it progresses.Only your mission is to get through the first half before the fun begins.The movie opens up with what I'm guessing is 1st year spies. It's one thing to explain to the audience this gadget does this, or causes this harm, but for the characters to act foolish like they know less than the typical non-espionage viewer, is just plain pathetic. Prime example is poor, out-of-place, Kristin Scott Thomas who, apparently, never heard of either the TV program or any spy-film before.Worse than these high school dropouts posing as international agents, is that they kill off the majority of the team within 25 minutes from the start. YOU DON'T DO THAT &#x96; or the original series wouldn't have lasted as long, obviously.And what's even worse than that? (Fast forwarding to the end) YOU DO NOT MAKE JIM PHELPS THE BAD GUY. Seriously? I can see why they did it &#x96; the star, Tom Cruise, wasn't going to play the older, white-haired leader and they (or most likely he) wanted to give the pending franchise to his Ethan Hunt character. Fine, but you still don't make the long-lasting hero the villain. You don't even kill him off &#x96; just make him retire, disappear using his own skills, etc.Anyhoo, the movie focuses a diskette containing undercover CIA operative's names purposely getting into the wrong hands to both capture the bad guys and revealing the double agent.

Fred MacMurray narrated and starred in the movie, although the movie was a huge critical success and was nominated for seven Academy Awards but did not win any. Billy Wilder's writing and directing of this movie is a masterpiece worth treasuring and a work of art worth owning.The movie and the book's idea is based on the Double indemnity clause provided in life insurance or accident policy whereby the insurance company agrees to pay the stated multiple (double) of the face amount in the contract in the case of death caused by accidental means.The movie was a box office success making over 5 times its production cost, and the cinematography used venetian blind lighting which became popular in later film noirs.

In the end, I think the movie is a fun assortment of ideas being exercised together in a rather harmless fashion. Schizopolis never seems to take itself seriously, the movie is made on a small-budget, with a purposefully contained cast, self-aware and referential humor, taking stabs at life, narratives, movies, culture, and humanity while never entirely aiming at any single target (except perhaps the filmmaker himself). I recommend this movie not because it is a fully realized concept (because it isn't) or because it is a hidden gem that must be discovered (because it isn't) but it is refreshing to see an experimental film created playfully, aware of its self-indulgence and entirely at ease with it.

In one famous scene, Mick Foley's family watching ring side is nearly put into tears after seeing their father and husband be beaten up by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson at a WWE PPV 'Royal Rumble'. Mick can't see that the abuse he takes on his body is hurting his family.

His daughter wants no part of him, and his father doesn't want to speak to him. Yes, there will be short knit bits of other wrestlers in the film, such as short lived career puking Darren Drozdov, the movie star dreaming New Jack, and two wrestlers Tony Jones and Michael Modest trying to get a try out. The director spent three years endeavoring to understand the mindset of someone who would voluntarily choose to become a professional wrestler. Blaustein interviews a wide variety of wrestling personalities and ascertains their motivations. What the movie lacks is interviews with the big time wrestlers of the time, Undertaker, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Triple H, and The Rock. It would be nice to see what their take on the business is. Another problem with the film is while they were able to film both in Extreme Championship Wrestling and World Wrestling Federeration, I felt that when World Championship Wrestling refused to participate in the film, it really made the film missing opinions of those wrestlers. The interview questions could have been more driven to talking about more serious key issues dealing with pro-wrestling such as steroids, wrestling union, and the sense of faking- violence. There are a couple of laughs in the movie, but the overall effect is much more depressing than it is humorous. The self-mutilations in the movie might be hard to watch for non-wrestling fans.
