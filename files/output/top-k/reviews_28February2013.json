Like any film, The Crow City of Angels isn't for everyone. Believe it or not, the first Crow film wasn't for everyone either. I will say that I did not like this film the first time I saw it. I am a major fan of the first and it's hard to enter the sequel with an open mind and clear perception. The second time I saw this film is when I fell in love with it and was able to by viewing it as it's own film. If you're going to sit there and compare it to the original, chances are you will never be happy with it. If you compared many movies to the first crow film you would never be happy with them either. I love this film completely separate from it's original counterpart. Though Miramax tried to make this a mirror image of the first film do not expect to see what you saw in the first film. This is a different place, a different man, and a different story. In my opinion it is the best of the sequels. Now, the third and forth crow films... whether I compare them to the first or not I just don't like them. They did not interest me in the slightest and I'm sorry I ever watched them.First off, there are throwbacks to the original film. Sarah is grown up and living as a goth tattoo artist in a grungy, post-apocalyptic Los Angeles. Sarah still wears Shelly's ring and has taken care of their cat Gabriel. She is also a painter. She's working on a painting of Eric and Shelly in which it's imagery comes full circle at the end of the movie. However, unlike the original crow film and its other sequels we're not watching the same story. This is what pisses me off about Salvation and Wicked Prayer They recycle the man and his girlfriend gets killed scenario. Eric Draven already did that. There's no need for multiple, watered down versions of this story. In The Crow City of Angels, Ashe Corven (Vincent Perez) and his young son Danny are killed by a drug cartel when they witness something they shouldn't have. Killing anyone is crossing the line but killing a child crosses multiple. For anyone who has been a parent this story will evoke your fear of losing a child. That story in it's own right is very terrifying.The bad guys are an interesting bunch. We have a Pre-punisher Thomas Jane as the perverted Nemo, the energetic and comical bad guy, Spider-monkey, Iggy Pop as Curve, along with Thuy Trang who was the original Yellow Ranger in the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. We also have Richard Brooks as the guy in charge, Judah. He's no Top Dollar but let me tell you, Brooks prevails in making you hate him throughout this film. This band of criminals aren't quite as interesting as T-bird's gang was in the original movie. That's okay. I don't want them to be because they're the bad guys and I'm supposed to hate them. In this film, you don't explore their personalities until they are about to die but we do spend a significant amount of time with Curve (Iggy Pop). Iggy brought just the right amount of energy into the film because the rest of the villains are overly calm and collected.I understand Vincent Perez's performance throws some people off. I happen to love and admire Vincent Perez as an actor mainly because of this film and his role in Queen of the Damned. I even admire the fact that he used subtle crow-like movements throughout the film. My perception is that we're supposed to believe the crow and the man are one entity divided. I truly felt that in Perez's performance. There's even a scene in the original cut of the film where the crow morphs into Ashe viewed from a shadow on the wall. You can actually still find it in the original trailer. That along with other things was left to die on the editing room floor, I guess. Perez did a great job in securing all the different emotions of the character. He's killing his killers but even when he does he's not becoming them.What I love most about this film is that on the technical end it was executed almost flawlessly from cinematography, lighting, coloration, production design and wardrobe. This film had everything I wanted to see in a movie. It had all the elements that Hollywood blockbusters are supposed to have. Highly stylized, strikingly visual, and mesmerizing.My last statement is that it bothers me that some people act like Brandon Lee is going to put a curse on them if they show any interest in the sequel. It is not disrespectful to Brandon Lee that this film was made. Them trying to remake the original? I find that much more disrespectful than anything. It's like they are trying to erase the original and Brandon Lee's performance in it whereas the sequels were more about trying to capitalize on it. This entire review is my personal opinion.

Here are the problems why this film is miserable and not funny. Fred Savage plays a awful kid who gets his mean-spirited nature from cruel dad played by Daniel Stern (not even this half-ass Wonder Years reunion could save it). The pranks are super awful especially the putting plastic on the toilet which is really cruel to women.

The script is somehow written by newcomers at that time the writer duo Terry Rossio and Ted Elliott (who would latter write more classical children films like Aladdin (where that film got it's supernatural annoying dick from), the first Shrek movie and Treasure Planet) who wrote this to punish kids or maybe hatted kids at that time. The monster world is too dark and red for a kid's film while going under the bed is interesting. The visuals are too scary to be a PG rating. Also the film need to be a PG-13 rating also to the language and this was back then when the people who rating films were not well and were too lazy. Finally, it has measurable things like kids being blamed and yelled from their at for the pranks Fred Savage and Howie Mandel made (oh my god!) and it's also good not to see some of the parents beat them up. Then to make it more miserable it has separation which kids really don't need to see their film until it has a better idea and is not too measurable.

And is on the the awful mean-spirited media next to Drop Dead Fred, The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy and Wilfred which are things I can't stand. This film is know to start the downfall of Fred Savage's fame and staring in movies (if though The Wizard was bad, this is worst) and Howie Mandel appearing in fewer movies.

The script is somehow written by newcomers at that time the writer duo Terry Rossio and Ted Elliott (who would latter write more classical children films like Aladdin (where that film got it's supernatural annoying dick from), the first Shrek movie and Treasure Planet) who wrote this to punish kids or maybe hatted kids at that time. The monster world is too dark and red for a kid's film while going under the bed is interesting. The visuals are too scary to be a PG rating. Also the film need to be a PG-13 rating also to the language and this was back then when the people who rating films were not well and were too lazy. Finally, it has measurable things like kids being blamed and yelled from their at for the pranks Fred Savage and Howie Mandel made (oh my god!) and it's also good not to see some of the parents beat them up. Then to make it more miserable it has separation which kids really don't need to see their film until it has a better idea and is not too measurable. Lastly it is very too mean-spirited for a comedy (sometimes it can work if it has a meaning and this film doesn't) and kid's thing. And is on the the awful mean-spirited media next to Drop Dead Fred, The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy and Wilfred which are things I can't stand. This film is know to start the downfall of Fred Savage's fame and staring in movies (if though The Wizard was bad, this is worst) and Howie Mandel appearing in fewer movies. I have to say this film is the evil big brother to Pixar's Monsters, Inc. and if you want a good family film to watch with kids, watch Monsters, Inc. instead of this depression piece of crap that can scar and frighting your kids to pain.

This amuses his wife, but Nick does stumble onto some clues and pieces together the facts for an intense investigation, and he eventually comes to conclude who the murderer really is, but he is not telling anybody his findings until an event he is putting on.

I didn't really dislike the film, but it's wasn't his best. Still, this is a good psychological drama. Love the famous vagina-like purse. Hitchcock was a keen Freudian and he definitely meant the handbag to represent the womb. Watch it give birth to all that money that Marnie need! Margaret Marnie Edgar (Tippi Hedren) is troubled young woman whom steals from companies. The oppressive silence robbery scene is one of the best, most tense scenes in movie history, the quietness is what makes it so realistic. I've always thought that thievery is a very interesting theme in film. The film lose it's edge, by Mark Rutland (Sean Connery), a large publishing company owner catch her in the act of stealing. Rather than turning her in, he pretty much black mails her to become his wife. Mark acts like a sexual predator whom catch his greatest pray, a woman who has an unnatural fear and mistrust of men, thunderstorms, and the color red. The woman is sexually traumatized. I feel very sorry for her. She steals money because of an emotional void in her life. She is afraid of sex. That means that she has never been in love or shared real romantic intimacy or achieved earth shattering orgasm. She was never blissfully happy by feeling complete with a boyfriend or husband. She does not want to marry or have children, but Mark force her to love him which force her to go through hell. He takes advantage of her catatonic 'submissive' state and get what he wants to the point of rape. Yes, it was 'rape'. It's rape because she's frigid and unwilling. Why do you think she tried to kill herself? I don't think in his mind he thought he was committing rape, he was just getting his 'conjugal rights', she signed on the dotted line to granting him 'conjugal rights' when she married him or else in law, the marriage is null and void. This movie felt like a woman's personally life being exposed, rape, and her faults being put on the table. This movie is unpleasant and Hitchcock tries to hide it through any means. Hitchcock insisted that Mark should be played by the sexy, dashing Connery--then at the height of his Bond years--that audiences would accept this unquestioningly. Plus this was 1963-4, remember, an era when sex was accepted as a husband's right, regardless of the circumstances. Sean Connery is still brutal and suave in this film. James Bond will return in Dr. No Means No. Hitchcock battled with screenwriter Evan Hunter over its inclusion - eventually getting Jay Presson Allen to write it. Hunter believed it implausible for a character like Mark to commit these acts. The movie has the 'rape' has romanticized as well. I find Connery zoologist character playing dime store psychologist, mining a sense of how deeply disturbed Marnie was and then taking the liberty of exposing her is downright wrong. It didn't help to know that Hitchcok himself sexually assaulted Hedren halfway through production as well, to get her into the role. He was taking the role, too serious for art's sakes. Hitchcock was so awful with harassing poor Tippi Hedren, must have been terrible working with him and she never work with him again. Another fault of the film is the over used of cheesy effects, such as over use of lighting, the fake backdrops and the way he use the color red. I can honestly understand the color of red being tapped into the film, but it was badly introduction in a Ed Wood type matter. The movie has some good things about it. Yes, it had the Hitchcock cameos, which are his signature and a superior Herrmann score and not just the titles, but through the entire film. The symbolism between the horse and the mother's leg is interesting. If you knew anything about Hitchcock, you'd know that his movies most often featured disturbing content; it is what his career thrived on. He loved making the audience squirm, and he took on this project because he knew a movie like this was taboo. He has always used sex and violence as arousal. Watch Psycho again for the similar affect in the bath tub. His point is that, you can show the hell out of violence but never sex, so you have to combine the two so the audience member becomes aroused via imagination. It's not explicit, but it's very disturbing. Hitchcock's preoccupation with pathology, psychology & mother-issues helped encourage psychotherapy in America. Most people in the 60's didn't want to think about what they were doing to their own children by exposing them to violence, sex and traumas. Hitchcock made people look at their﻿ own actions & fear the consequences. He knew his own fears & made them ours.

Hitchcock was a keen Freudian and he definitely meant the handbag to represent the womb. Watch it give birth to all that money that Marnie need! Margaret Marnie Edgar (Tippi Hedren) is troubled young woman whom steals from companies. The oppressive silence robbery scene is one of the best, most tense scenes in movie history, the quietness is what makes it so realistic. I've always thought that thievery is a very interesting theme in film. The film lose it's edge, by Mark Rutland (Sean Connery), a large publishing company owner catch her in the act of stealing. Rather than turning her in, he pretty much black mails her to become his wife. Mark acts like a sexual predator whom catch his greatest pray, a woman who has an unnatural fear and mistrust of men, thunderstorms, and the color red. The woman is sexually traumatized. I feel very sorry for her. She steals money because of an emotional void in her life. She is afraid of sex. That means that she has never been in love or shared real romantic intimacy or achieved earth shattering orgasm. She was never blissfully happy by feeling complete with a boyfriend or husband. She does not want to marry or have children, but Mark force her to love him which force her to go through hell. He takes advantage of her catatonic 'submissive' state and get what he wants to the point of rape. Yes, it was 'rape'. It's rape because she's frigid and unwilling. Why do you think she tried to kill herself? I don't think in his mind he thought he was committing rape, he was just getting his 'conjugal rights', she signed on the dotted line to granting him 'conjugal rights' when she married him or else in law, the marriage is null and void. This movie felt like a woman's personally life being exposed, rape, and her faults being put on the table. This movie is unpleasant and Hitchcock tries to hide it through any means. Hitchcock insisted that Mark should be played by the sexy, dashing Connery--then at the height of his Bond years--that audiences would accept this unquestioningly. Plus this was 1963-4, remember, an era when sex was accepted as a husband's right, regardless of the circumstances. Sean Connery is still brutal and suave in this film. James Bond will return in Dr. No Means No. Hitchcock battled with screenwriter Evan Hunter over its inclusion - eventually getting Jay Presson Allen to write it. Hunter believed it implausible for a character like Mark to commit these acts. The movie has the 'rape' has romanticized as well. I find Connery zoologist character playing dime store psychologist, mining a sense of how deeply disturbed Marnie was and then taking the liberty of exposing her is downright wrong. It didn't help to know that Hitchcok himself sexually assaulted Hedren halfway through production as well, to get her into the role. He was taking the role, too serious for art's sakes. Hitchcock was so awful with harassing poor Tippi Hedren, must have been terrible working with him and she never work with him again. Another fault of the film is the over used of cheesy effects, such as over use of lighting, the fake backdrops and the way he use the color red. I can honestly understand the color of red being tapped into the film, but it was badly introduction in a Ed Wood type matter. The movie has some good things about it. Yes, it had the Hitchcock cameos, which are his signature and a superior Herrmann score and not just the titles, but through the entire film. The symbolism between the horse and the mother's leg is interesting. If you knew anything about Hitchcock, you'd know that his movies most often featured disturbing content; it is what his career thrived on. He loved making the audience squirm, and he took on this project because he knew a movie like this was taboo. He has always used sex and violence as arousal. Watch Psycho again for the similar affect in the bath tub. His point is that, you can show the hell out of violence but never sex, so you have to combine the two so the audience member becomes aroused via imagination. It's not explicit, but it's very disturbing. Hitchcock's preoccupation with pathology, psychology & mother-issues helped encourage psychotherapy in America. Most people in the 60's didn't want to think about what they were doing to their own children by exposing them to violence, sex and traumas. Hitchcock made people look at their﻿ own actions & fear the consequences. He knew his own fears & made them ours.

I first watched it when I was 14 years old and I seemed to be a bit impressed by it. OK, it's not as strong as the original due to it's flaws, but it's a very good sequel and a very underrated one at that.First of all, I like how the story doesn't repeat the original and it's darker tone is represented well throughout the film, but aside from it's decent character development, it does derive itself from two books of the Oz series Land of Oz and Ozma of Oz. The script does have it's problems with several scenes that were completely cut.Flaws aside, everything is done perfectly. The cinematography is brilliant, the stop motion effects on the Nomes, although dated back then, are splendid, the scenery is beautiful, the costumes and make-up on the new characters including the villain Mombi, the Nome King, Jack the Pumpkinhead, and others are perfect. The direction from editor Walter Murch is solid and builds a lot of tense and atmosphere to the darker tone of the film; the music from David Shire is pretty good too. The best part goes to the cast of actors. Fairuza Balk did a fantastic job portraying a much younger Dorothy (don't get me wrong. Judy Garland's role as Dorothy was timeless), Jean Marsh is a menacing Mombi, Brian Henson is a wonderful sidekick Jack the Pumpkinhead and Nicol Williamson is a frightening Nome King.Overall, Return to Oz isn't as excellent as The Wizard of Oz, but I can see why this got a cult following over the past few years and I would recommend this to those who haven't seen it.

Now I understand some are going to be offended by the stereotypes as well as some of the animation but I think the film still works well for adults. I think the best stuff involves the animation including the three animals. I thought all three of them were very well done and for the most part the animation is top-notch. I really liked the adventures of the three as Fox and Bear are constantly trying to catch Rabbit who always manages to out-smart them. The highlight of the film deals with a bee hive and this sequence is extremely funny. Another major plus is the performance of Baskett as Uncle Remis. I wasn't completely won over by all the live action stuff but there's no question that Baskett steals the picture as the soft-hearted Remis. The actor does an extremely good job bringing the charm and you just can't help but feel this character was one of the best roles for a black actor at this time period. Again, I'm sure many people are going to cry foul due to some of the material (Tar Baby for one) but at the same time it's always important to remember when this film was made. If someone doesn't want to watch the film because they find it offensive then that's fine.

It's not only one of my favorites in Elm Street series and one of my favorite Horror movie sequels,but one of my favorite sequels in general.Set six years after the first film,Dream Warriors tells the story about a group of troubled teenagers who are patients at psychiatric hospital who are all having nightmares and are being stalked by dream demon Freddy Krueger(Robert England). Now with the help of Nancy Thompson(Heather Langenkamp,survivor of the first film)and Dr. Neil Gordon(Craig Wasson)the teens are going to figure out how to stop Freddy and get rid of him once and for all.I think one of the reasons Dream Warriors is an excellent sequel is because this takes the concept of Wes Craven's(who co-wrote the script for this film)brilliant,groundbreaking first film and takes a step further with this film. Instead of having Freddy come into your dreams and your nightmares and killing you,DW has Freddy going into teenagers dream worlds and nightmares and taking the things that teenagers like or dislike and turning it against them. It's a scary concept for this film because it makes Freddy more powerful not just from a physical advantage,but a mental advantage. The Nightmare and dream sequences are effective,dark and imaginative and will have you on the edge of your seat with lots of tension and suspense that is like a tightrope and you will feel like you are inside the nightmares and dreams and you want to wake up. The first 10-15 minutes of the film set the tone for the rest of the film,showing viewers a world where teenage suicide is just a normal occurrence and happens all the time. It was pretty daring for a film to take on such a taboo subject like suicide during the 80s(remember this was 2 years before Heathers hilariously tackled the subject of suicide)and I think that's one of the things,along with the dream sequences that add to the dark and Gothic tone of the film and make the film bleaker than it is. The characters in the film are well-developed and likable and when things start to go wrong you will feel sympathy for them and root for them as the film goes on. One of the things that I've always liked about the Elm Street films and what sets them apart from other slasher films is that the characters are not just faceless victims waiting to be killed or slaughtered,but are well-developed characters that viewers can relate to and identify with and this film is no exception. The Action and violence in the film is well-done and fits the tone of this film and while the film is not as completely bloody or gory as the first two films DW has a few moments of blood and gore. The character Freddy Krueger is creepy in this film and spits out darkly funny one-liners something which has divided Horror fans for years as many have said that the film made Freddy from a scary villain to comical one I say yes and no to that. Yes because the later films made him less scarier and more of a comedian and the star of the films no because many fans seem to forget that Freddy had always had a twisted since of humor especially in the first two films that is often overlooked because Freddy was always in the shadows and dark. Freddy's an excellent character and has never been a silent slasher movie villain and the character had to evolve and do more things otherwise the series would've never gone on. I can understand most fans complaints about the Freddy character,but maybe because of his personality and one-liners Freddy's one of my favorite movie characters. The ending of the film will shock and surprise viewers because it's a twist that you will not see coming or expect and is one of the things that adds to the greatness of the film.The whole cast is great in their roles. Heather Langenkamp does a wonderful job as Nancy who returns from the first film to help the teenagers fight Freddy. Craig Wasson does a great job as Dr. Neil Gordan,the doctor who cares about his patients and Wasson has a great chemistry with Langenkamp. Patrica Arquette(in her film debut)is excellent as Kristen,a girl who has a powerful gift. Robert Englund is scary and menacing as Freddy,while saying great one-liners. Laurence Fishburne does a wonderful job as Max an orderly who cares for the patients. Jennifer Ruben does a good job as Taryn,a recovering drug addict who is tough. Ken Sagoes is great as the short-tempered,but sympathetic Kincaid. Nan Martin is creepy as the mysterious nun Sister Mary Helena. John Saxon returns from the first film as Donald Thompson and gives a good performance. Ira Helden does a fine job as Will. Rodney Eastman gives a good performance as Joey,a teen who doesn't talk. Bradley Gregg(Phillip),Penelope Sudrow(Jennifer),Prisilla Pointer(Dr. Simms)and Brooke Bundy(Elaine Parker)give good performances as well. Also lookout for cameos from Dick Cavett and Zsa Zsa Gabor.The direction from Chuck Russell is great,with Russell effective and dark atmosphere giving the film a sense of dread and energy. Great direction.The score by Angelo Badalamenti is creepy and scary and fits with the film's dark tone. Great score. The film also has great songs from Dokken including the great title track Dream Warriors and Into The Fire. Great songs.The special effects in the film are amazing especially with the Freddy make-up and the special effects hold up well.In final word,if you love Horror films or the Nightmare On Elm Street films I highly suggest you see A Nightmare On Elm Street 3Dream Warriors a great Horror film that is one of best films in the series.

Freddy's an excellent character and has never been a silent slasher movie villain and the character had to evolve and do more things otherwise the series would've never gone on. I can understand most fans complaints about the Freddy character,but maybe because of his personality and one-liners Freddy's one of my favorite movie characters. The ending of the film will shock and surprise viewers because it's a twist that you will not see coming or expect and is one of the things that adds to the greatness of the film.The whole cast is great in their roles. Heather Langenkamp does a wonderful job as Nancy who returns from the first film to help the teenagers fight Freddy. Craig Wasson does a great job as Dr. Neil Gordan,the doctor who cares about his patients and Wasson has a great chemistry with Langenkamp. Patrica Arquette(in her film debut)is excellent as Kristen,a girl who has a powerful gift. Robert Englund is scary and menacing as Freddy,while saying great one-liners. Laurence Fishburne does a wonderful job as Max an orderly who cares for the patients. Jennifer Ruben does a good job as Taryn,a recovering drug addict who is tough. Ken Sagoes is great as the short-tempered,but sympathetic Kincaid. Nan Martin is creepy as the mysterious nun Sister Mary Helena. John Saxon returns from the first film as Donald Thompson and gives a good performance. Ira Helden does a fine job as Will. Rodney Eastman gives a good performance as Joey,a teen who doesn't talk. Bradley Gregg(Phillip),Penelope Sudrow(Jennifer),Prisilla Pointer(Dr. Simms)and Brooke Bundy(Elaine Parker)give good performances as well. Also lookout for cameos from Dick Cavett and Zsa Zsa Gabor.The direction from Chuck Russell is great,with Russell effective and dark atmosphere giving the film a sense of dread and energy. Great direction.The score by Angelo Badalamenti is creepy and scary and fits with the film's dark tone. Great score. The film also has great songs from Dokken including the great title track Dream Warriors and Into The Fire. Great songs.The special effects in the film are amazing especially with the Freddy make-up and the special effects hold up well.In final word,if you love Horror films or the Nightmare On Elm Street films I highly suggest you see A Nightmare On Elm Street 3Dream Warriors a great Horror film that is one of best films in the series. Highly Recommended. 10\/10.

It's not only one of my favorites in Elm Street series and one of my favorite Horror movie sequels,but one of my favorite sequels in general.Set six years after the first film,Dream Warriors tells the story about a group of troubled teenagers who are patients at psychiatric hospital who are all having nightmares and are being stalked by dream demon Freddy Krueger(Robert England). Now with the help of Nancy Thompson(Heather Langenkamp,survivor of the first film)and Dr. Neil Gordon(Craig Wasson)the teens are going to figure out how to stop Freddy and get rid of him once and for all.I think one of the reasons Dream Warriors is an excellent sequel is because this takes the concept of Wes Craven's(who co-wrote the script for this film)brilliant,groundbreaking first film and takes a step further with this film. Instead of having Freddy come into your dreams and your nightmares and killing you,DW has Freddy going into teenagers dream worlds and nightmares and taking the things that teenagers like or dislike and turning it against them. It's a scary concept for this film because it makes Freddy more powerful not just from a physical advantage,but a mental advantage. The Nightmare and dream sequences are effective,dark and imaginative and will have you on the edge of your seat with lots of tension and suspense that is like a tightrope and you will feel like you are inside the nightmares and dreams and you want to wake up. The first 10-15 minutes of the film set the tone for the rest of the film,showing viewers a world where teenage suicide is just a normal occurrence and happens all the time. It was pretty daring for a film to take on such a taboo subject like suicide during the 80s(remember this was 2 years before Heathers hilariously tackled the subject of suicide)and I think that's one of the things,along with the dream sequences that add to the dark and Gothic tone of the film and make the film bleaker than it is. The characters in the film are well-developed and likable and when things start to go wrong you will feel sympathy for them and root for them as the film goes on. One of the things that I've always liked about the Elm Street films and what sets them apart from other slasher films is that the characters are not just faceless victims waiting to be killed or slaughtered,but are well-developed characters that viewers can relate to and identify with and this film is no exception. The Action and violence in the film is well-done and fits the tone of this film and while the film is not as completely bloody or gory as the first two films DW has a few moments of blood and gore. The character Freddy Krueger is creepy in this film and spits out darkly funny one-liners something which has divided Horror fans for years as many have said that the film made Freddy from a scary villain to comical one I say yes and no to that.

I enjoyed his first film but never thought much of it because there wasn't anything to it. In the case of Snatch, it's just a rehash of the Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels with more recognizable cast and more over the top Guy Ritchie direction.So in other words, Snatch is the same film plot wise as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels with some differences here and there. The setup, the characters and the way it's resolved is very similar to that film. Every single character in this film speaks like a Guy Ritchie character with the accent, choice of witty remarks and so on. It's pretty much the same shtick Tarantino does with his characters most of the time. And there are no female characters aside from naked strippers, weird twins or the bookie chick. We live in modern society were women exist and why can't these directors\/writers use them. Snatch is just a horribly written and just shows that Guy Ritchie can't write anything but hip and cool gangsters and forgets to actually add depth or character to them.But as a director he is slightly better. He knows to keep his film short and pace them well. It's infuriating and stupid but not dull. His visuals and the way he edits his films are kinda obnoxious and just shows that he has nothing to offer. Hot Fuzz which parodied his film making style had much more depth and character than Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels combined.There are few things that I enjoyed. Jason Statham is cool as usual even when he stars in sub par films. Rade Serbedzija is always enjoyable as you might expect from him and my favorite of all - Brad Pitt. I love when he goes nuts and plays a weird character with bizarre accent. And that's about it.To make it simple - Snatch is a vacuous retread of Guy Ritchie's previous film. It has nothing new to offer and wastes your time with unrealistic characters, stupid, contrived plot and no real meat or substance to back up the style. If you like these hip and cool British crime films that try too hard to be Tarantino, go watch In Bruges. Don't waste your time with this atrocity.

There is good humor with the crank calling and the shower scene is dramatic and well choreographed.

There is an idea purveyed that a young woman can take care of herself and stay safe just by talking her way through potential trouble.
