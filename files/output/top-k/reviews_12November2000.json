How many adult actors have performed so flawlessly when actually dying?Who should see this film This film is for people who want a bit of scaryness, but don't want to be freaked out of their skin. It is perfect if you want formulaic scary bits, but also want a happy ending. It is quite a 'fun' horror film because many expectations are met. It is not inivative or new or origional, but it is a fun time-passer. It is also has less annoying cliches & characters than the origional, but the adult casting is a severe disopointment. Ignore the adults, look at Heather & Lara Flynn Boyle's characters and in Heather's case see a potentialy brilliant actress who never had the chance to fullfil what would have been a brilliant career.Tips View this movie as you would a dream. Get into the imagery & symbolism, ignore the bad adult acting & direction and just look at what Carol Anne went through. The idea of 'Alice through the looking glass' is explored through the horror genre to 3D psychological terror. This is a subtle philosophical film & not a mainstream 'easy digestible' horror. The viewer is meant to consider their role as voyeur & not in the 'Hammer House of Horror' sense. This film challenges how we 'look' at film in general. It makes us question what we truelly want to happen & whether this makes us 'sick' or not. This film deserves more credit than it got upon release, because it has not been understood. The ending does ruin the deepness of the philosophical content, so ignore the ending & question the main sequences that deal exclusively with 'reflextion' & reflecting\/projection of us & expectations. The middle of the film is reflective of what the great Trauffaut tried to achieve, but never quite could - the projection of self in others. It is a very intelligent film that has been badly edited, unlike the previous films that weren't very intelligent, but cleverly edited! I hope we get a 'Director's cut', as it may offer an ending to compliment the content.This film is the last of it's kind in the horror genre, a straight narrative, with formulaic structure.

It's a film that you can watch over & over & still not understand all that is possible, unlike the previous films. It is not nearly as scary as the previous films, so you can rewatch it to contemplate the philosophy behind it. It's very clever idea, but badly constructed. There are many loose ends not resolved by the end, such as the demonic teenagers. It is this that ultimately proves the editing to be at fault. This film needs re-editing.

But if you're looking for an entertaining 90 mins with lots of laughters, then you should go right away. DEUCE BIGALOW is a stupid film, with alot of funny scenes that will make you laugh out loud continuously. Rob Schneider is also very funny, just like he uses to be in every show he appears.  Still the cinematographical value of the film does not exist. This is why i originally intended to rate it with 7. Funny, but stupid.

Outstanding special effects, a competent cast, great sound, and an artistic eye for set design are the film's strong points. After what seems like a long drought, it's nice to see the sleek Carrie-Anne Moss back on the screen. Serious, pragmatic, and physically fit, she is a natural choice for a mission commander. Some might argue that she and the other characters are somewhat wooden, but I would counter that coolness is a requisite trait in those individuals who are selected to fly such a mission. The director had to choose between verisimilitude and dramatic impact, and I applaud his riskier choice of the former.Special effects and set design really stand out and are worth the price of admission. Just when you are thinking that they are going to use the typical cop-out of artificial gravity on a spaceship, the centrifuges fail, and we are treated to some of the best weightlessness scenes ever filmed. Other reviewers have complained that fire scenes in the ship look fake, but how are we supposed to know what fires look like in free-fall in the first place? I think the f\/x people did a great job in speculating on how a fire would behave in such conditions. Scenes on Mars were breathtaking, I think better even than those of this year's earlier release, MISSION TO MARS. Also, this is the first film I can recall that tried to do anything with the fact that Mars gravity is about one-third that of Earth's. I realize that low-g is difficult to simulate on film, but I do applaud the filmmakers for the small (and humorous) attempt they made to accommodate it.While I do recommend seeing this feature in theatrical release for the majesty of the picture and sound, this is not to say there aren't a lot of problems, some quite massive. Generally these relate to plausibility1. The ship design is totally outlandish. The thing is _huge_, with oodles of wasted space. There are two enormous counter-rotating centrifuges to simulate gravity for the crew; this makes the ship more on the scale of the space station envisioned in 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY. This is for a crew of six! And with all that wasted mass, the Mars landing module is not much bigger than an Apollo lunar module. Was there any kind of space travel expert to advise the filmmakers on how ridiculous this is?2. The Martian terraforming theory is completely at odds with what is known about the planet from probes that have been going there since 1976. The movie explains that nuclear weapons are sent to the polar caps to melt (actually sublime) the CO2 ice, which then acts as a greenhouse gas to heat up the atmosphere. When it's warm enough, algae are introduced to generate oxygen. The problem is that THERE IS NO WATER ON THE SURFACE OF MARS, GUYS. Algae can't grow without water. Then, there are other ecological aspects that are even more ridiculous, but to go into those gives away too much of the plot. Just be prepared to have your suspended sense of disbelief pulled out from under you.3. Stupid little script errors that a little research could have avoided. First, don't try to do CPR the way Carrie-Anne Moss did it in the film; it's completely wrong. The geneticist remarks that his work is all about genetic code, you know, A, G, T, and P. The problem is that THERE IS NO 'P'. It's 'C' for cytosine. Again, sloppy writing.Now, I realize that there are perennially dyspeptic science nerds out there who can never enjoy a science fiction movie because of this or that little inaccuracy. Trust me; I'm not one of those, and I can suspend disbelief as well as the next person.

Outstanding special effects, a competent cast, great sound, and an artistic eye for set design are the film's strong points. After what seems like a long drought, it's nice to see the sleek Carrie-Anne Moss back on the screen. Serious, pragmatic, and physically fit, she is a natural choice for a mission commander. Some might argue that she and the other characters are somewhat wooden, but I would counter that coolness is a requisite trait in those individuals who are selected to fly such a mission. The director had to choose between verisimilitude and dramatic impact, and I applaud his riskier choice of the former.Special effects and set design really stand out and are worth the price of admission. Just when you are thinking that they are going to use the typical cop-out of artificial gravity on a spaceship, the centrifuges fail, and we are treated to some of the best weightlessness scenes ever filmed. Other reviewers have complained that fire scenes in the ship look fake, but how are we supposed to know what fires look like in free-fall in the first place? I think the f\/x people did a great job in speculating on how a fire would behave in such conditions. Scenes on Mars were breathtaking, I think better even than those of this year's earlier release, MISSION TO MARS. Also, this is the first film I can recall that tried to do anything with the fact that Mars gravity is about one-third that of Earth's. I realize that low-g is difficult to simulate on film, but I do applaud the filmmakers for the small (and humorous) attempt they made to accommodate it.While I do recommend seeing this feature in theatrical release for the majesty of the picture and sound, this is not to say there aren't a lot of problems, some quite massive. Generally these relate to plausibility1. The ship design is totally outlandish. The thing is _huge_, with oodles of wasted space. There are two enormous counter-rotating centrifuges to simulate gravity for the crew; this makes the ship more on the scale of the space station envisioned in 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY. This is for a crew of six! And with all that wasted mass, the Mars landing module is not much bigger than an Apollo lunar module. Was there any kind of space travel expert to advise the filmmakers on how ridiculous this is?2. The Martian terraforming theory is completely at odds with what is known about the planet from probes that have been going there since 1976. The movie explains that nuclear weapons are sent to the polar caps to melt (actually sublime) the CO2 ice, which then acts as a greenhouse gas to heat up the atmosphere. When it's warm enough, algae are introduced to generate oxygen. The problem is that THERE IS NO WATER ON THE SURFACE OF MARS, GUYS. Algae can't grow without water. Then, there are other ecological aspects that are even more ridiculous, but to go into those gives away too much of the plot. Just be prepared to have your suspended sense of disbelief pulled out from under you.3. Stupid little script errors that a little research could have avoided. First, don't try to do CPR the way Carrie-Anne Moss did it in the film; it's completely wrong. The geneticist remarks that his work is all about genetic code, you know, A, G, T, and P. The problem is that THERE IS NO 'P'. It's 'C' for cytosine. Again, sloppy writing.Now, I realize that there are perennially dyspeptic science nerds out there who can never enjoy a science fiction movie because of this or that little inaccuracy. Trust me; I'm not one of those, and I can suspend disbelief as well as the next person. But RED PLANET just pushes it way too far, to the extent that there is compromise of the movie-watching experience. If you know little about science and nothing about Mars, you may rate the film fairly high, but otherwise, be prepared for a jolt.

I've seen his work from his four films to the Daredevil books he penned for Marvel Comics.  I think through everything, this is by far his best work, which I hope he'll one day be able to top so I can say the same about another one of his projects.What makes this film stand out is the sense of honesty and believability this film and its characters portray.  An unusual love story, with comic book artist Holden (Ben Affleck) falling in love with another comic book writer Alyssa (the uber-cute Joey Lauren Adams) who happens to be lesbian. Coming to terms with an askew (pardon the pun) relationship and dealing with his jealous, overprotective best friend (Jason Lee) are his main concerns throughout the film.This film is both comedy and drama.  Smith uses his usual over-the-top observational humor and insightful points to tell a story about imperfect love.  It's funny, it's sad, and you can't help but feel sorry for Holden as he runs the risk of ruining everything in his life while attempting to make all of the pieces fit.Kevin Smith needs to stick more to films like this.  That doesn't mean that all of his films should be about lesbians, but observational humor is where he by far succeeds the most.  He still hasn't got the physical, slapstick humor to match his verbal wit, but hopefully things will balance out in time.  His writing has always been smart, honest, realistic, and often laugh out loud funny, even in a more serious moment.  Even Silent Bob's (rather outspoken for the character) comment on lost love is a real eye-opener.  I think everyone chases their own Amy at one point or another.Hollywood's idea of a good film may be based on box-office receipts, but good writing or a relationship to the characters is what keeps people coming back to see a film years later.  This film remains one of my top favorites, and while the film's premise may or may not be realistically possible, you can't help but see that parallels found in any relationship.

Fox) and a local headbanger (Jack Noseworthy) Anton comes up with a few odd ways of keeping his hand occupied from its homicidal tendencies such as listening to heavy metal and needle point. Let me just say that this movie is hilarious.  I should also say that this movie is also one of the grossest and goriest movies I've ever seen.  There are quite a few hilarious moments as well as a few shocking ones. Vivica A. Fox's name says it all and Jessica Alba isn't bad to look at either.10\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Horror, Thriller"}]
