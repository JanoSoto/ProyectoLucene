Requiem For A Dream is by far one of the most brutal, honest and incredibly uncompromising films about drugs and drug abuse ever made. Films about drugs tend to either glamourise or preach. Requiem does neither; it manages to stay impartial. The only other films about drugs I've seen that have managed to do this are Gus Van Sant's wonderful Drugstore Cowboy (1989) and Danny Boyle's flat-out masterpiece Trainspotting (1995).Essentially, Requiem follows four characters over the course of three seasons, starting at summer- Tyrone, Marion, Harry & Sara. What I admire about this film so much is that it has the guts to show how and why people are attracted to drugs. In Sara's case, to lose weight. In the case of the other three, because they like getting high and, in the case of Harry & Tyrone, making money. This is where the illusions to the concept of the so-called American Dream are clearest for me.Aronofsky also shows what happens when everything spins out of control with drugs;the downward spiral. Using an arsenal of cinematic effects such as fast cuts,split screen and Snorricam (where a camera is attached to the actor), Aronofsky and his cinematographer Matthew Libartique really put the viewer in the headspace of a user. The film has a strong emotional resonance to it. You feel every misfortune and blow that these characters are hit with. The overall effect is simply devastating. This is filmaking from a very psychological pont of view and not the MTV filmaking style that it has been accused of.The performances from all four of the lead actors- Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Waynes (in a rare dramatic role) and Ellen Burstyn -are outstanding and display a commitment to the material rarely seen on screen these days. I must make mention of Ellen Burstyn as Sara. This is one of the most electrifying, heartbreaking performances ever committed to film. Her performance is truly the beating heart of this film. If, as a viewer, you're not moved of affected by Burstyn's phennomenal performance in Requiem, you truly have a heart of stone. It shows why she is considered on of the greatest actresses working today.Be warned. This film is not for the faint of heart. My wife said she felt physically ill after seeing it due to both subject matter and the way that it was presented. It is one of the few films in recent memory that has left me physically shaking after seeing it for the first time. I've known too many people who have had their lives affected by illegal drugs in some way or another as well as facing my own demons on that front many years ago. This film rings all too true.It is a shame that the film is restricted to an over-18 year old audience in Australia. I would suggest that this be mandatory viewing for anyone around the age of fifteen or so. If it could stop one person from doing hard drugs, that the film has succeeded at what I feel it was trying to do.This is an essential and truly timeless film.Thank you, Darren Aronofsky. Thank you.

It is based on the Stephen King novella The Body, a story that depicts four close adolescent boys who go on a quest to recover a missing boy's dead body in hopes of becoming town heroes. Even King himself has said numerous times that Stand by Me is one of his favorite movie adaptations of a book. Nowadays, it is a very rare thing to come across a movie that has such superb acting, a gripping plot, and such a wonderfully made bittersweet ending as shown in Stand by Me. Although made more than 20 years ago, this movie is so timeless.The movie is set in the summer of 1959. Gordie Lachance (Wil Wheaton), Chris Chambers (played beautifully by River Phoenix), Teddy Duchamp (Corey Feldman), and Vern Tessio (Jerry O'Conell) play four very close twelve year old boys who help each other through the hard times and make the best of memories together. Gordie is the sensitive writer. He is unfortunately overlooked by his parents due to his star athlete brother's untimely death four months earlier. Chris may be the most complex yet relatable of the group all at once. He is a tough guy on the outside, who steals the milk money at school, and has a reputation of being the bad seed. Yet underneath it all, he wants nothing more than to succeed in life. Teddy Duchamp is the zany one, who can make everybody laugh without any effort. His dad stormed the beach at Normandy, a thing Teddy greatly admires even though his dad held his ear to a stove (more is revealed about it in the film). Vern Tessio is the portly kid who everybody picks on but still loves. A little bit slow and always forgetting something, Vern is a character I think everyone eventually feels for. Keifer Sutherland also does a great job playing Ace Merrill, the town bully who the four boys are constantly insulted and teased by. Although it is clear Ace will be stuck in the small town the boys live in for the rest of his life, he still reigns.The four main boys set out on an adventure together in order to find the dead body of missing 12 year old classmate Ray Brower. At first, the viewer may assume that this adventure is solely about four kids just wanting to see a decomposing body. However, Stand by Me is far from that. The adventure is accompanied by coming-of-age revelations, emotional breakdowns, heartache, and the longing for acceptance. This is the time in which their lives will change forever. Their last real time of innocence, as the movie's tagline states.I must point out River Phoenix's performance as the troubled Chris Chambers. This was his star-making performance, and obviously for a good reason. His acting is wonderful in every aspect. There is never a scene where his acting could have been improved. It is that incredible. Not to say the other boys did not do well, because they definitely did, but Phoenix's performance stood out. Due to his surprising death in real life that came all too soon in 1993, I was left at the end of the movie thinking he could have done so many other great things with his talent. At least the world was able to recognize him as such a talented actor while we had the chance.The music in this movie is also something to be recognized as phenomenal. It is filled with classics from the '50s that make the movie that even more unforgettable. I do not believe I have heard better-fitting music for a film ever before in my life. Ben E. King's Stand by Me is placed just at the end of the movie, and it all makes perfect sense. The song made the ending that much better. It is truly a beautiful part of the movie.All of themes of friendship are so timeless and relatable no matter what year we are in. The acting is magnificent and is guaranteed to make a lasting impression on you. It will probably bring a tear to your eye, but I think in a good way. And it is really one of those movies you can watch over and over and never fall out of love with.Stand by Me is easily one of the best films ever made.

Danny takes his seat & the film starts, the magic ticket actually does turn out to be magic & Danny is transported into the film where he meets his film idol Jack Slater (executive producer Arnold Schwarzenegger) & he becomes part of the film helping Jack avenge the murder of his favourite second cousin. However the films main bad guy Benedict (Charles Dance) gets hold of Danny's magic ticket & uses it transport himself into the real world where the bad guy's can actually win unlike in the movies...Co-produced & directed by John McTiernan after Steven Spielberg turned the chance to direct down to make Schindler's List (1993) I really rather enjoyed Last Action Hero & I must confess I'm at a loss as to why it was so badly received when it was originally released. The script by Shane Black & David Arnott is actually a very knowing & clever parody of the mega budget Hollywood action flick for which star Schwarzenegger is most famous for & I thought it was very funny to see him parody & make fun of himself, in particular at the end when the real Arnold Schwarzenegger is being interviewed at his films premiere & he says his new film is more responsible because they only kill 48 people in it rather than 148 or when during the same scene he tries to plug his own Planet Hollywood restaurants! I really liked some of the ideas here like the fact the film world Danny finds himself in is populated by beautiful model like women which he comments on or that in the film a wound which would have killed Schwarzenegger in real life is seen as nothing more than a flesh wound! The filmmakers have great fun sending up the action film as a whole from the puns to the fact the character of Jack Slater is running out of family members so the bad guy's have to kill his second cousin! Then when Danny brings Schwarzenegger back into the real world & he tries to smash a car window with his hand he actually feels pain, the scenes on top of the roof where Schwarzenegger is holding onto the cable & rescues Danny slightly ruins the stance taken by the filmmakers as it imitates & essentially copies what it's been parodying & trying to send up but what the hell the film as a whole is great entertainment that pokes all sorts of light hearted fun at the action flick in general. I never thought I'd say this but Last Action Hero is a clever & very knowing Schwarzenegger film that might go on for a bit too long but when a films this much fun who cares?Director McTiernan does a good job & there are plenty of over-the-top action scenes, car chases, shoot outs, explosions & fights amongst all the countless film references & homages from E.T. (1982) to Lethal Weapon (1987). There are also lots of fun cameo appearances from the likes of Jean-Claude Van Damme, James Belushi, Chevy Chase, Sharon Stone leaving a police station & Robert Patrick dressed as an LAPD cop like his role in Terminator 2 Judgment Day (1991) as the T-1000! There are so many gags & visual references for action film junkies to spot there's no way you'll spot them all the first time you watch it, I just think this is an action packed film which doesn't take itself too seriously & is great fun to watch.With a supposed budget of about $85,000,000 this flopped at the box-office with very negative critical & audience reactions which is a shame because I really liked it for what it is, making only $16,000,000 at the box-office bad word of mouth & opening the same weekend as Steven Spielberg's monster hit Jurassic Park (1993) probably were the main reasons why & Schwarzenegger's $15,000,000 he was paid didn't help the budget either. It's well made with plenty of big bangs & big names on screen for your money, the acting is alright & even the kid didn't annoy me.Last Action Hero is a really good slice of light hearted action that uses the genres clichés to amusing effect & there's even a message here about real life being very different to what happens in films & there are consequences if you try to smash a car window with your fist! I know a lot of people don't like Last Action Hero so I won't say you definitely will but I think it's a film that's worth a watch if nothing else, to be safe watch it on TV or rent it rather than buy it & you may just like it.

The script by Shane Black & David Arnott is actually a very knowing & clever parody of the mega budget Hollywood action flick for which star Schwarzenegger is most famous for & I thought it was very funny to see him parody & make fun of himself, in particular at the end when the real Arnold Schwarzenegger is being interviewed at his films premiere & he says his new film is more responsible because they only kill 48 people in it rather than 148 or when during the same scene he tries to plug his own Planet Hollywood restaurants! I really liked some of the ideas here like the fact the film world Danny finds himself in is populated by beautiful model like women which he comments on or that in the film a wound which would have killed Schwarzenegger in real life is seen as nothing more than a flesh wound! The filmmakers have great fun sending up the action film as a whole from the puns to the fact the character of Jack Slater is running out of family members so the bad guy's have to kill his second cousin! Then when Danny brings Schwarzenegger back into the real world & he tries to smash a car window with his hand he actually feels pain, the scenes on top of the roof where Schwarzenegger is holding onto the cable & rescues Danny slightly ruins the stance taken by the filmmakers as it imitates & essentially copies what it's been parodying & trying to send up but what the hell the film as a whole is great entertainment that pokes all sorts of light hearted fun at the action flick in general. I never thought I'd say this but Last Action Hero is a clever & very knowing Schwarzenegger film that might go on for a bit too long but when a films this much fun who cares?Director McTiernan does a good job & there are plenty of over-the-top action scenes, car chases, shoot outs, explosions & fights amongst all the countless film references & homages from E.T. (1982) to Lethal Weapon (1987). There are also lots of fun cameo appearances from the likes of Jean-Claude Van Damme, James Belushi, Chevy Chase, Sharon Stone leaving a police station & Robert Patrick dressed as an LAPD cop like his role in Terminator 2 Judgment Day (1991) as the T-1000! There are so many gags & visual references for action film junkies to spot there's no way you'll spot them all the first time you watch it, I just think this is an action packed film which doesn't take itself too seriously & is great fun to watch.With a supposed budget of about $85,000,000 this flopped at the box-office with very negative critical & audience reactions which is a shame because I really liked it for what it is, making only $16,000,000 at the box-office bad word of mouth & opening the same weekend as Steven Spielberg's monster hit Jurassic Park (1993) probably were the main reasons why & Schwarzenegger's $15,000,000 he was paid didn't help the budget either. It's well made with plenty of big bangs & big names on screen for your money, the acting is alright & even the kid didn't annoy me.Last Action Hero is a really good slice of light hearted action that uses the genres clichés to amusing effect & there's even a message here about real life being very different to what happens in films & there are consequences if you try to smash a car window with your fist! I know a lot of people don't like Last Action Hero so I won't say you definitely will but I think it's a film that's worth a watch if nothing else, to be safe watch it on TV or rent it rather than buy it & you may just like it.

Its a homage to classic American film, it has a strange sense of time and place like it could almost be the 1950's. The sounds that accompany the film add to that classic feel of the movie, its always there adding atmosphere to the film like movies used to do.The film deals with many things though its main themes are class, hate, and violence.Class and power are brought up. The wealthy in the film seem to wield power casually over those they view as not of their caste. The lawyer omitted evidence that would have resulted in a dismissal just because he 'knew' this rough white guy had to have done the crime. The way he gets favors from his wealthy pals its obvious that if he defending someone of his caste he would have presented the evidence.In fact the ease with which someones life is ruined and the world doesn't even pay it an ounce of attention, this is one of the most terrifying things in the film. The film really shows the impact of power unlike any film i've seen.How does someone hate? To many people its some vague notion. To others its a sin. The 'christian' judge in the film represents this viewpoint, chastising a man who has been abused and hounded by a psychopath because he is 'displaying' negative emotions. While he himself has probably never experienced any major wrong inflicted on him by another, he has never had to resist hate.De Niros character never tried to resist it, he dove straight into it. 14 years in prison breeding and brewing hatred. Thats the films point, this guy is no saint and we have no doubt about that. But the viewer struggles with his feelings because he knows Noltes character was wrong, and we see how 14 years of prison has twisted De Niro and we hear about what happened to him there. One is forced to think, if someone set me up and got me put in prison would I hate to the point that De Niro would?The flip side of this course is how easy Noltes character loses it when faced with a similar situation to the abuse De Niro experienced in prison. How easily he breaks rules, how he seems ready to do anything to get rid of this character. Isn't this also hate? This culminates with the final scene, Noltes character bellowing like a wounded animal lifts a giant rock over his head ready to crush De Niros skull. We are used to the hero coming to his senses and renouncing violence. Not Nolte, he follows through smashing the rock down where De Niros head should have been.This is a powerful statement and the finale.The film pulls back the pretense most of us have about ourselves, how we are more like those 'on the other side of the tracks' than we can imagine. It just maybe that they have had to deal with these issues of hate, class, and violence and we have not.A great film that allows you to relax into it, its both ugly and beautiful at the same time.

I knew it would be weird, but I was not expecting this. I like weird movies, but this makes Donnie Darko look like Titanic. Incredibly, incredibly over-the-top in its weirdness. Perhaps a few years ago, this would have bothered me, but I made a conscious effort to watch this film as a film student, not as a movie fan. Although I could easily criticize it for its nonsensical plot and exceptional artiness, I am choosing not to. Why? I really don't know.Right from the opening frame, the film grabbed me with its uniqueness. The single credit, in formal font, displaying David Lynch Presents, made it seem more like a dinner invitation than the opening to a film. The opening sequence, right up until the first shot of the factory, is such a weird way to open the picture, and yet, it works. The first line isn't said until, what, fifteen minutes in? But the film never lost my interest or caused me to turn it off - I was mesmerized. Right from the get-go, the film's unique style is reinforced, with the odd white noise present in the background, the long lingering camera shots, and the lead character's incredibly wacky hair style.The film soon becomes an exercise in trying the audience's patience. Increasingly strange and disturbing scenes interrupt long, slow, awkward moments, but it all seems to fit together. The dinner scene, the mutant baby, the lady in the radiator, the man in the planet - everything is exceptionally weird, but it just seems to work. My personal favourite sequence is a nightmarish scene from where the title is derived - Henry's decapitated head is used as the source for pencil eraser. When it ends, there's no sense of dissatisfaction, but you really don't know what to think. For some, I suppose it could be viewed as overtly indulgent, but I quite liked it.Jack Nance gives a surprisingly good performance, given the fact that the film was shot over five years; his crazy hair aside, he manages to portray both sadness and anger in equal amounts. The shadowy lighting and stark direction suit the film perfectly, and the strange characters are all realized very well. The grey, smoke-filled, almost (some would say definite) post-apocalyptic environment is pulled off excellently and the disgusting mutant baby is just that disgusting. It really is an experience to watch it; I wish I could do so at one of its infamous midnight showings. Still, I really have to sleep on it; it's not an easy film to grade.

Isn't it odd &#150; people just don't laugh as much anymore, and I do believe one of the diseases to that problem is the film Showtime. There was absolutely nothing, from the beginning to the end of the credits, with all of the bantering between Murphy and De Niro, with Russo as eye candy, with even standard clichés which make the general population swoon with pre-programmed laughter, there was nothing in this film that made me laugh. There weren't the overbearing physical jokes or the calculated mental vocal jokes at all throughout this debacle of a film. From the beginning, I didn't buy the match-up of De Niro and Murphy as anything more than Hollywood excitement, throughout the commentary the director vividly talks about the hijinks and laughter going on during the shoot &#150; where was it in the film? This falls to either two problems &#150; the director really doesn't have a sense of comedy or the editor didn't understand the value of the film. Either way, they both doomed the entire hour and a half spent on the Hollywood nightmare Showtime.Outside of finding no reason to laugh, there was no reason to follow these characters through any moment of the film. There was a glimpse of humor with De Niro's desire to pick up pottery as a hobby (but the director had to write KILN on the machine so audiences would understand &#150; WHO DOES THAT?), but that was dropped and never developed. There was the idea that Murphy was an actor, but outside of that one opening monologue, nobody would have understood that. He rents a room in a producer's house in which he can afford on a police officer's salary? This just didn't compute even for Hollywood standards. There was a bad guy who wanted a big gun, but the gun was never developed, nor was there any true test of the weapons capability &#133; even at the end. It became a bigger joke to laugh at an accent than remember the guns. Where was the television show in this? Russo had to get permission from this random guy at the beginning, but there were no consequences. There was nothing in the middle of this film outside of further questions and meaningless dribble. Random characters were introduced, forgotten, re-introduced, and forgotten all over again. The director and producer laughed at this, while we, the meager viewer, must suffer through inside jokes and cliché stereotypes.Was there a love interest in this film? Was there a truly sinister bad guy that went apart from the comic duo to bring true evil to the screen? Were there any pop culture references that didn't come back to Robert De Niro? Was there random chaos throughout this film? If you need the answers to these, obviously, you won't find them in Showtime. The fact that I am riddling this review with question upon question, only means that this sub-par (actually, well below sub-sub-sub par) filled no quota or resembled anything of value to the cinematic world. Sure, it had big names and one really neat explosion, but there was nothing of substance to this at all. It was almost as if the director said prior to the shoot that he wanted clichés, but not regular clichés &#150; go with the bad ones. The plot had no linear structure. The jokes were boring. The characters were drab and underdeveloped. This ranks below even the best of buddy-cop films. I like to give films the benefit of the doubt, but nothing worked in this film. Not even Shatner could save this film, and he even tried hard.Overall, I cannot, nor will I, suggest this film to anyone with a pulse. The commentary only confirms the pathetic nature of the film with obvious flaws, horrid jokes, and creators questioning the validity of their work. If creators can't stand behind Showtime, why should we? I didn't want a Lethal Weapon when I watched this, but I did want something like that. I understand there was some form of criticism of reality television and the corrupt nature of the media, but that message didn't make it off the page. In fact, I believe I saw media leave the theater first when I watched this. Shame carries its heavy hand with this film and I cannot blame it. Murphy used to be a big star, comedy was his middle name (see Coming to America), but lately he seems to have lost his edge. De Niro obviously wants to get away from an image that haunts him, but making these sort of films is only going to set him back further. One of these films is equal to one Scorsese picture.Skip this one. I promise, it will make your final cinematic days worthwhile.

It's not supposed to be a comedy. But because of its silly plot full of holes and ridiculous dialog, it turns out to be unintentionally funny.Forest Whitaker, Dwight Yoakam and Jared Leto play a trio of robbers that makes the Three Stooges look smart. They resemble the hapless burglars Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in Home Alone. Only this time it's Jodie Foster and Kristen Stuart who are home alone when the three goofballs break into their home to steal the millions of dollars hidden in the Panic Room. That's a vault room that the previous owner had built into the house. It's so safe that no one can break into it. It has its own phone and electrical system, its own air filtration system and surveillance cameras to see every room in the house. And guess who helped build it. Forest Whitaker, one of the robbers. This movie is so dumb. Here are just a few of the many glaring errors1. Whitaker is able to pump propane gas into the room, even though it has its own ventilation system. He does this simply by knocking a hole in the drywall. The room itself is encased in concrete and steel.2.He's also tries to tap into a phone cable, which, get this, is sticking out of a jack in the wall and which, get this, Jodie Foster manages to, in the nick of time, yank out of the wall even though she is in the panic room. 3. The hapless robbers seal the house so that no one can get in or out. But, who happens to appear? Foster's husband. That's right. He manages to just appear in the foyer even though they have locked up the house tight and sealed the doors with screws. 4. How about the fact that large tools appear from nowhere such as the drill press which Whitaker uses to drill into the safe. Why would anyone go to all the trouble to put a safe in a Panic Room yet the safe is so weak you can drill into it? Beats me. 5. Foster's daughter who it turns out goes into diabetic coma and needs an injection. This certainly came out of the blue.In short, Panic Room is one of the stupidest movies in recent memory. It is not just stupid, it's incredibly stupid. The dialog is absolutely so bad it's a hoot. The plot is so full of holes you'll be laughing your butt off.Too bad.

He gets light on fire, and lives. How does he die? Only one way. By hearing the word Bitch obviously. But of course he's back in the sequel.Overall, this movie rocks. It is unmissable and one of the best movies ever made. Come quickly A3 and bring Sarone with you.

People compare it to Saving Private Ryan as the best war film of all time and although I probably prefer Saving Private Ryan, Apocalypse Now is still up there amongst it. A reoccurring quote from Apocalypse Now towards its dramatic concluding twenty minutes is 'the horror' and what a great thematic quote to use, not only as the film's tagline but also as a statement to sum up what goes on in Apocalypse Now and to sum up the Vietnam War in general. Apocalypse Now has a theme already and thus; scores points with me before it's even begun.Apocalypse Now is just full of the basics done brilliantly. The cinematography, the mise-en-scene, the atmosphere, the voiceovers powered by the screenplay &#150; they all combine in pretty much every scene and deliver on such a level, it's so very difficult not to like. It truly sucks you into the film and into Vietnam. What the backbone of Apocalypse Now is that makes it so great is that its story is that of a single line journey; Apocalypse Now is a war based 'road movie' since it takes place down one stretch of track (a river) and involves the protagonist Benjamin Willard (Sheen) and his 'crew' getting into all sorts of conflict and adventures which is something that these sorts of films have that I just love.When people think of Vietnam films, they think of the jungle and jungle warfare. Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July and We Were Soldiers are all acclaimed in their own right but Apocalypse Now moves away from the jungle in a way that feels so refreshing and new, it makes for fantastic viewing. There is so much to read out of this film, it's incredible. The first 'taste' of warfare we get is presented to us much like it is in Saving Private Ryan although it doesn't come as soon it's presented in a state of absolute chaos. We have several choppers flying along, music blaring out, cut to the village they're about to attack calm and peaceful until the American's arrive more chaos, shouting, gunfire, orders being passed down, destroyed buildings bridges and cars as well as distressed villagers. What makes them even greater then what they actually start out as is when the American's actually start to struggle in their fight as a chopper is destroyed and someone is brutally injured in the fire fight. Epic, truly epic and a fantastic introduction to the warfare to expect.The journey not only of discovery but of self discovery Willard undergoes in fascinating in its own right. The numerous incidences involving things like the supply boat they search, the bridge checkpoint they reach and the trench encounter as well as the ambush from the jungle they suffer and the scene after that when someone is lying there dead whilst a tape from home plays over a shot of their corpse &#150; it's all ingenious film-making. One such scene I loved was following the girlie show the Americans have that descends into chaos, Willard states that the Vietcong's idea of nightly entertainment probably consists of 'a bowl of rice and something nice and simple'. I feel this is a statement of how something that should have gone so straightforward (a girlie show and the winning of the Vietnam war) can quickly get really out of hand and thus, turn into a mess.If there is a criticism, then it occurs during the final act of Apocalypse Now. The film goes from a war film with a mission and a plan to a much darker, more disturbing display of a character gone mad (Kurtz &#150; Brando) in a dystopia full of strange characters, disorientating settings and a cow getting hacked up but this is in no way a major criticism. The film does slow down slightly when Willard is caged and spoken to through the character of a photojournalist (Hopper) and Kurtz just seems to be on the brink of a philosophical breakthrough one minute but spouting rubbish the next in almost all of his scenes. The payoff, however, as the mission reaches its climax is superb.There's no doubt that I really enjoyed Apocalypse Now and although Kramer vs. Kramer is still great; how this and Saving Private Ryan lost out on the best picture awards in their respective years is still beyond me.

SONS OF THE DESERT is their best modern film comedy - set in the 1930s. WAY OUT WEST is their sole western and wonderful as such. And BABES IN TOYLAND (a.k.a. THE MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS) is their best operetta - THE DEVIL'S BROTHER and BOHEMIAN GIRL are good, but BABES IN TOYLAND always fascinates.It does so for several reasons The sets are the most elaborate in any of the Laurel and Hardy features. After all it is Toyland. We see the homes of the characters (like Bo-Peep's mother, the old woman in the shoe, and Silas Barnaby's home). We see the Toymaker's workshop and it's hundred six foot tall wooden soldiers that move (a typical L & H goof-up Santa told them he wanted six hundred one foot tall wooden soldiers and they got the figures mixed up). We see the main square of Toyland, and the dunking pool, and the cave that leads to Bogeyland.There are other points. Victor Herbert's music is always melodious, although to be honest the score of the Walt Disney remake actually included the words of at least one standard (I Can't Do The Sum!) that is only heard as background music in this film version. That the tune Never Mind Bo-Peep, although it has an elaborate chorus structure, was included instead is somewhat astounding. Still enough of the film's music in the film works - abetted by the singing of Felix Knight as Tom - Tom, the Piper's Son.Rosina Lawrence was always a sweet but attractive woman, and her performance as damsel-in-distress Bo-Peep is quite good. But the best is Henry Brandon (here Henry Kleinbach) as Silas Barnaby. BABES IN TOYLAND is one of the few Roach Laurel & Hardy features where Jimmy Finleyson does not appear (SWISS MISS is another film that lacks Finn). Charley Hall has a bit part, but nothing special (not like an appearance like in the short THEM THAR HILLS, for example). Instead, Brandon appears for his only time in Laurel & Hardy's world here - and carries it off well. Barnaby is a nasty customer - aiming his financial grasp over the Widow Peep's home to force Bo-Peep to marry him. But he constantly is being bothered by the boys. His first appearance is when Ollie and Stan are playing with some dart-like toy that knocks off Silas' hat (he naturally confronts Ollie and teaches him a lesson). They also try to steal his copy of the mortgage by a version of the Trojan Horse, which Silas doesn't quite swallow from the start. And finally they wreck his seemingly successful marriage ceremony to Bo-Peep. In truth one doesn't sympathize that much with Silas, but he certainly reacts with spirit to what the boys put him through.*(*Laurel and Hardy fans and Our Gang fans will both know that Brandon had the experience that rarely happens - Howard Freeman had it as Himmler in HITLER'S MADMAN and later a twisted clone of the Gestapo head in the episode The Beast That Walked the Bronx on CAR 54 WHERE ARE YOU - when four years later Roach cast him in the Our Gang short, OUR GANG FOLLIES OF 1938 as Barnaby, but now a demonic opera impresario who forces Alfalfa to sing in the street for pennies!)Finally there are the boys, comic from the start (with them sharing a bed and sleeping, snoring a feather from one to the other in sequence). Ollie's inability to play the dart game that Stan plays perfectly causes him to insist that anything Stan can do he can do. Stan smiles and shakes his head, and starts repeating the Earsie - Eyesie - Nosie routine from THE DEVIL'S BROTHER (Ollie looks angry and embarrassed at this).

SONS OF THE DESERT is their best modern film comedy - set in the 1930s. WAY OUT WEST is their sole western and wonderful as such. And BABES IN TOYLAND (a.k.a. THE MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS) is their best operetta - THE DEVIL'S BROTHER and BOHEMIAN GIRL are good, but BABES IN TOYLAND always fascinates.It does so for several reasons The sets are the most elaborate in any of the Laurel and Hardy features. After all it is Toyland. We see the homes of the characters (like Bo-Peep's mother, the old woman in the shoe, and Silas Barnaby's home). We see the Toymaker's workshop and it's hundred six foot tall wooden soldiers that move (a typical L & H goof-up Santa told them he wanted six hundred one foot tall wooden soldiers and they got the figures mixed up). We see the main square of Toyland, and the dunking pool, and the cave that leads to Bogeyland.There are other points. Victor Herbert's music is always melodious, although to be honest the score of the Walt Disney remake actually included the words of at least one standard (I Can't Do The Sum!) that is only heard as background music in this film version. That the tune Never Mind Bo-Peep, although it has an elaborate chorus structure, was included instead is somewhat astounding. Still enough of the film's music in the film works - abetted by the singing of Felix Knight as Tom - Tom, the Piper's Son.Rosina Lawrence was always a sweet but attractive woman, and her performance as damsel-in-distress Bo-Peep is quite good. But the best is Henry Brandon (here Henry Kleinbach) as Silas Barnaby. BABES IN TOYLAND is one of the few Roach Laurel & Hardy features where Jimmy Finleyson does not appear (SWISS MISS is another film that lacks Finn). Charley Hall has a bit part, but nothing special (not like an appearance like in the short THEM THAR HILLS, for example). Instead, Brandon appears for his only time in Laurel & Hardy's world here - and carries it off well. Barnaby is a nasty customer - aiming his financial grasp over the Widow Peep's home to force Bo-Peep to marry him. But he constantly is being bothered by the boys. His first appearance is when Ollie and Stan are playing with some dart-like toy that knocks off Silas' hat (he naturally confronts Ollie and teaches him a lesson). They also try to steal his copy of the mortgage by a version of the Trojan Horse, which Silas doesn't quite swallow from the start. And finally they wreck his seemingly successful marriage ceremony to Bo-Peep. In truth one doesn't sympathize that much with Silas, but he certainly reacts with spirit to what the boys put him through.*(*Laurel and Hardy fans and Our Gang fans will both know that Brandon had the experience that rarely happens - Howard Freeman had it as Himmler in HITLER'S MADMAN and later a twisted clone of the Gestapo head in the episode The Beast That Walked the Bronx on CAR 54 WHERE ARE YOU - when four years later Roach cast him in the Our Gang short, OUR GANG FOLLIES OF 1938 as Barnaby, but now a demonic opera impresario who forces Alfalfa to sing in the street for pennies!)Finally there are the boys, comic from the start (with them sharing a bed and sleeping, snoring a feather from one to the other in sequence). Ollie's inability to play the dart game that Stan plays perfectly causes him to insist that anything Stan can do he can do. Stan smiles and shakes his head, and starts repeating the Earsie - Eyesie - Nosie routine from THE DEVIL'S BROTHER (Ollie looks angry and embarrassed at this).

Essentially a filmed journal, it is narrated by Chris (Charlie Sheen), a young volunteer recruit just starting his first tour, and viewed mostly through his grunt perspective we see the nitty gritty of daily life for the grunts who paid so dearly for their government's folly during this terrible conflict. It also illustrates with devastating realism the attitude many American GI's were forced (or chose) to adopt that ANYONE could be the enemy, even seemingly innocent, benign villagers. This was very true during that war, and resulted in horrendous civilian casualties.Chris encounters two father figures in Sgt Barnes (Tom Berenger) and Sgt Elias (Willem Dafoe). Barnes plays the cynical, hardened vet, Elias the more humane and less psychotic voice of reason and truth. No more is this division evident than in the underground scenes, where the two groups (those loyal to Barnes, the others to Elias) split up, one partaking in cards, whiskey and prayer, while the others retreat to an underground bunker to indulge in the harder side of Viet Nam life heroin, weed, and everything white rabbit. Chris takes up with the underground crowd, headed up by Elias, and including a young Johnny Depp in a role that unfortunately was mostly cut from the final release.After a vicious attack on an alleged Viet Cong village, the two groups are inexorably pulled apart and towards conflict from within, which proves to be far more destructive than the enemies they are supposed to be fighting against. The real war becomes a personal one, raging inside them all, and illustrated through Chris' experiences.The final battle scene perfectly captures the absolute chaos and confusion, noise and terror of war. You can't really tell where the enemies are, you just know they are there by the bullets whizzing by your head...Another thing illustrated with realism is the tunnel rat sequence with Willem Dafoe infiltrating a Viet Cong tunnel. While I would have liked to have seen more of this (as it was a HUGE part of the initial stages of that war) it was good to at least see it presented once.(As a side note, the Viet Cong tunnel system was INCREDIBLE. If you are keen to find out more, track down the book The Tunnels of Cu Chi can't remember the authors' names but it's a great story, told from both sides, about the extensive network of tunnels the Viet Cong dug, even right UNDER some American army camps!) The Gold Edition contains a Director's Commentary and also a commentary track from military adviser Dale Dye (USMC Ret) who also served in Viet Nam.While budget and resources limited the scope of what could be done here (no CGI), Oliver Stone dispenses with big spectacle battle scenes and instead focuses on a riveting, engaging and indeed very moving storyline, complemented by great actors and some really nice photography and production design of the Vietnamese jungle and villages, American camps etc.Now while I haven't seen EVERY war movie out there, this one certainly struck me as a definitive anti-war message (with its bloody, brutally realistic portrayal of the violence and insanity that goes hand in hand with war), the only recent war movie to match it, I believe, is The Thin Red Line.
