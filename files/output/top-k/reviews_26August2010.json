Unlike most young actresses, however, at least Whitherspoon can look back and know she was exploited in a quality film while she was working with some of the best performers of a generation and one of the biggest movie stars of all time.Harry Ross (Paul Newman) used to be a cop and, after that, used to be a private investigator. But after a job down in Mexico bringing back the rebellious daughter of an aging movie star named Jack Ames (Gene Hackman), Harry gets shot. Ames takes Harry into his home while he recovers, then keeps him around as a handyman and family friend. Two years after the Mexico mess, the cancer-stricken Ames asks Harry to deliver an envelope for him. When he takes it to the instructed address, Harry nearly gets shot by a guy who was himself shot in the gut sometime before Harry arrived. Harry manages to just barely avoid getting killed until the guy dies, after which he discovers the man was named Lester Ivar (M. Emmet Walsh). I var was another former cop turned private eye and Harry learns that Ivar was continuing to investigate the disappearance of a actor 20 years ago. That actor was the then-husband of Jack Ames' current wife Catherine (Susan Sarandon). It seems the actor disappeared just in time to clear the way for Catherine to leave him for Jack. And if you think you know where the story is going based on that little plot twist, you're right. That is where the story goes. Harry's investigation into who killed Ivar, who's blackmailing Jack Ames and what happened to Catherine's first husband brings him into contact with another old private eye buddy (James Garner) and an old flame on the police force (Stockard Channing) before culminating in the sort of darkly hopeful ending that the best film noir always aspires to pull off.This is a very good movie. As I mentioned earlier, it's not much of a mystery. You might not be able to guess every single detail of the story before it unfolds, but you figure out early on how it's going to play out and even how it will likely end up. There's very little whodunit going on here, but that's not a problem. This isn't a movie about how a mystery gets solved. It's about the people caught up in it.The actors in Twilight are every bit as good as you could expect or want with performers of this caliber. Whitherspoon gives the weakest performance of the lot, but what young woman could measure up to the veteran talent in this cast? Newman, Sarandon, Hackman, Garner and Channing all do superb work as those rarest of all Hollywood movie characters &#x96; grown ups. These aren't old people tagging along in a young person's world and they aren't characters who behave a decade or two younger and stupider than they actually are. These are people with histories that define then and histories they sometimes struggle to overcome. Newman and Hackman are especially marvelous to watch as two men who both know the thread of their life is running thin and are readying themselves for that end. Even though you know where the story is going, it's a great pleasure to watch these characters get there.Twilight is quite a nice film with lots of real human emotion, humor and drama. It takes a very down-to-Earth approach to desperate acts and how they can shape people's lives, in contrast to many films where it seems like every aspect of existence is heightened and exaggerated to ridiculous levels. Newman made a handful of enjoyable and classy movies like Twilight at the end of his career and they serve as a worthy capstone to his remarkable achievements.

The film takes place in modern day Philadelphia.The film starts off with Andrew Beckett (Hanks) and Joe Miller (Washington) working together in some sort of law meeting, they do not know each other before this and are for some reason in a meeting together. Beckett works for a big law firm and is promoted to become a senior partner, but at the meeting where he is congratulated one of the partners of the law firm notices a mark on his forehead. The film then cuts to I believe a month later where it is revealed that Beckett has been fired and is requesting Miller, a fellow lawyer, to help him sue the law firm that he worked at because he believed that he was fired due to the fact that he was a homosexual and had AIDS. Miller says that Beckett does not have a case due to the fact that he does not have enough information to make that conclusion. After some time it shows how Miller has a daughter and then the two men are at the public library. Miller at first hides from Beckett but then sympathizes for him because a librarian is asking him to go to the private section due to his illness. That is when Miller offers his services to Beckett and the highly emotional film starts to get the wheels turning.The screenplay for this film was highly moving. The characters had much depth to them and I understood how each the leads were feeling. I could feel how Beckett was not only suffering from his terrible illness, but from the people around him who thought he was disgusting and unnatural. Yet I also understood the reasons to why Miller disliked homosexuals and his reasoning for that dislike, but I respected him greatly for putting his personal beliefs to the side and doing what the law says to be correct. The film has some great comedic moments along with its memorable emotional moments. The only problem was that it was somewhat predictable, but that really did not make the journey the film brought me on less enjoyable.The direction by Jonathan Demme was very good for this film. The shots in general were really nothing special, but they got the job done, he succeeded greatly in bringing so much emotion into this film. He has proved that he can get amazing performances out of his actors and has gotten three of the actors he had worked with Oscars. It was not as well directed as The Silence of the Lambs, but still with these two back to back great films one would think he would have a much more successful career.The acting in this film was phenomenal. Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar he received for his performance as Andrew Beckett and this performance is one of the many reasons why he is considered one of the greatest actors. He was just a purely lovable character and I felt so deeply for him. Bravo, Mr. Hanks, too bad you haven't acted this well since Cast Away. Denzel Washington was absolutely fantastic as Joe Miller. He is the most relatable character and was great in every aspect. His performance not getting nominated for an Oscar is another of the greatest snubs in history, yet I do not feel as bad for him since he did end up earning two Oscars so far in his career. Antonio Banderas has a minor role of playing Andrew Beckett's partner and plays it to the best the role can be played. Wonderful performances all around.The score for this film was as well brilliant. It added all the emotion whether it be light hearted or heart breaking. The song by Bruce Springsteen won an Oscar as it should have and the whole into score is exactly how such an emotional picture should be done.Overall I give this film a strong 8\/10 because it is very good in every aspect. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys courtroom dramas or films that are about social problems that are faced in the world.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"26 August 2010","score":"","review":" Though legally based off a short story by Ward Greene, the actual roots of The Lady and the Tramp are in a series of sketches by storyman Joe Grant that the studio had shelved years before. Unfortunately, Grant left the studio long before production began, and never received credit for the film that had been loosely based off his own concept, but animators like Eric Goldberg have worked to increase awareness of his contribution and the story itself lives on in this excellent film.As for the film itself, it turned a mighty profit and drummed up a less receptive critical response, who criticized the lack of depth to the characters (bizarre how this is the Disney film that invites such ire...). Despite such criticisms, which are probably rooted in the fact that most of the characters are admittedly variations on stereotypes, this is actually the subtlest and most character driven Disney film since Bambi. Considering the high concepts and low emotions of the last few Disney movies, such strong storytelling is probably why this film was their best work since the golden age, marking a (brief) return to the quality of those early masterworks for the next few films.The problem was that Disney's previous few films were all plot. Character goes from point A to point B, encounters obstacle, overcomes obstacles, etc. Cinderella was a bit better in that it wasn't so narrative, but it suffered from a boring protagonist. Disney's strength was in animals and broad human characters, which, ironically, were always far more emotive and closer to human mannerisms than their realistic humans. With The Lady and the Tramp, Disney makes the right decision to keep the humans off-screen (being much more expressive with their hands than with their features) and focus instead on the world of dogs (which are just symbols of humans anyway).Each character is definitely defined, with Lady's pampered, sheltered lifestyle reflected in her prettied-up appearance and dainty mannerisms contrasting sharply with that of Tramp, who revels in dirt and walks like he owns the streets. It's an obvious conflict, but effective like all the best romantic obstacles. Opposites attract indeed.One could try to read some social implication here, but I'm not sure it's that deep. Rather, the theme here is of many different types of creatures interacting, making this more of a general and simplified story about prejudice than anything else. Honestly, I'd have liked Disney to get more daring with this and actually show some real destitution among the dogs, but I guess this isn't supposed to be *beep* Watership Down (though I have to give major props to the Disney crew for sneaking in implications of Tramp having been a bit of a womanizer...er...bitchizer...I'm writing that word down for future use).Another thing that makes this the finest Disney movie in years is in how it reincorporates the practice of the early films in getting across moments bound to frighten any and all children. The rat is, like The Coach Man, one of those Disney villains who doesn't appear all that much, but who makes a real impression when he does. While its Frank Thomas's spaghetti eating scene that gets mentioned all the Nine Old Men tributes and framed and parodied all over the place, it's actually Wolfgang Reitherman's fight scene between Tramp and the street dogs that is probably the best piece of animation here. Despite the inevitable lack of blood, there's a genuine ferocity here that almost makes the viewer think there is. As always, though, every piece of animation is excellent from a performance standpoint.This was the first film Disney made in cinemascope, but rather than using it to create a spectacle like Peter Pan, what we have here is a film about characters reacting to their environment. The larger than life backgrounds, beautifully composed especially considering the difficulties of working in a new aspect ratio, create an environment to rival the early work. Now, just wait for the kind of crazy *beep* Disney was to pull off with Sleeping Beauty.As a whole product, this is the first Disney work since Bambi that feels complete. It's not just a series of fun moments, but a total story that makes an impression and invites sympathy for its characters. And, at the end, the viewer feels satisfied. I can't quite put it on the level of Bambi or Pinocchio, since it doesn't quite reach the visceral or atmospheric heights of the early work, but it comes very close and deserves its iconic status in Disney's canon. For a while, Disney would in fact be on a brief upward trajectory.

While its Frank Thomas's spaghetti eating scene that gets mentioned all the Nine Old Men tributes and framed and parodied all over the place, it's actually Wolfgang Reitherman's fight scene between Tramp and the street dogs that is probably the best piece of animation here. Despite the inevitable lack of blood, there's a genuine ferocity here that almost makes the viewer think there is. As always, though, every piece of animation is excellent from a performance standpoint.This was the first film Disney made in cinemascope, but rather than using it to create a spectacle like Peter Pan, what we have here is a film about characters reacting to their environment. The larger than life backgrounds, beautifully composed especially considering the difficulties of working in a new aspect ratio, create an environment to rival the early work. Now, just wait for the kind of crazy *beep* Disney was to pull off with Sleeping Beauty.As a whole product, this is the first Disney work since Bambi that feels complete. It's not just a series of fun moments, but a total story that makes an impression and invites sympathy for its characters. And, at the end, the viewer feels satisfied. I can't quite put it on the level of Bambi or Pinocchio, since it doesn't quite reach the visceral or atmospheric heights of the early work, but it comes very close and deserves its iconic status in Disney's canon. For a while, Disney would in fact be on a brief upward trajectory. ","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"26 August 2010","score":"","review":" Though legally based off a short story by Ward Greene, the actual roots of The Lady and the Tramp are in a series of sketches by storyman Joe Grant that the studio had shelved years before. Unfortunately, Grant left the studio long before production began, and never received credit for the film that had been loosely based off his own concept, but animators like Eric Goldberg have worked to increase awareness of his contribution and the story itself lives on in this excellent film.As for the film itself, it turned a mighty profit and drummed up a less receptive critical response, who criticized the lack of depth to the characters (bizarre how this is the Disney film that invites such ire...). Despite such criticisms, which are probably rooted in the fact that most of the characters are admittedly variations on stereotypes, this is actually the subtlest and most character driven Disney film since Bambi. Considering the high concepts and low emotions of the last few Disney movies, such strong storytelling is probably why this film was their best work since the golden age, marking a (brief) return to the quality of those early masterworks for the next few films.The problem was that Disney's previous few films were all plot. Character goes from point A to point B, encounters obstacle, overcomes obstacles, etc. Cinderella was a bit better in that it wasn't so narrative, but it suffered from a boring protagonist. Disney's strength was in animals and broad human characters, which, ironically, were always far more emotive and closer to human mannerisms than their realistic humans. With The Lady and the Tramp, Disney makes the right decision to keep the humans off-screen (being much more expressive with their hands than with their features) and focus instead on the world of dogs (which are just symbols of humans anyway).Each character is definitely defined, with Lady's pampered, sheltered lifestyle reflected in her prettied-up appearance and dainty mannerisms contrasting sharply with that of Tramp, who revels in dirt and walks like he owns the streets. It's an obvious conflict, but effective like all the best romantic obstacles. Opposites attract indeed.One could try to read some social implication here, but I'm not sure it's that deep. Rather, the theme here is of many different types of creatures interacting, making this more of a general and simplified story about prejudice than anything else. Honestly, I'd have liked Disney to get more daring with this and actually show some real destitution among the dogs, but I guess this isn't supposed to be *beep* Watership Down (though I have to give major props to the Disney crew for sneaking in implications of Tramp having been a bit of a womanizer...er...bitchizer...I'm writing that word down for future use).Another thing that makes this the finest Disney movie in years is in how it reincorporates the practice of the early films in getting across moments bound to frighten any and all children.

Not only is it my all-time favorite Western and therefore, one of my all-time favorite movies regardless of genre, but is a landmark in the history of cinema itself. First of all, it is proof that oftentimes the simplest ideas are the best ones. The plot is fairly simple three men try to reach a buried fortune of Army gold coins while the Civil War erupts around them. The story is even simpler and yet the audience gets wrapped around in it as 160 minutes and those 160 minutes just seem to whip by so fast that when the movie does end, we're craving for more. The film is also evidence that the Western is not a dying genre, for this landmark film from Italian director Sergio Leone has aged like wine; time has done nothing to varnish its style and authority. And it is also proof that Spaghetti Westerns, which are low in budget and oftentimes flamboyant and over-the-top, can be art, too.This was the third and final time that Clint Eastwood worked with Sergio Leone. He returns again as the mysterious Man with No Name a cigar-chugging bounty hunter quick on the draw and minimal in emotions. Here is the pinnacle of the vintage Eastwood as an actor, where he could manufacture a character by doing little other than squinting and hissing some sparse dialogue. Eastwood's in prime form here. The movie also features Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes, a mercenary\/bounty hunter\/Army colonel, the exact opposite of the warm-hearted character he played in the previous Western For a Few Dollars More. But oddly enough, even though Eastwood gets top billing, the central character is Tuco, played with outstanding charisma and sharp energy by Eli Wallach. Wallach had played bad guys and anti-heroes before, but here as the bumbling, deliberately comical, greedy, self-centered, and yet somehow likable and personable Tuco, he steals the show. The movie stays interesting as these three men change partnerships with each other, whenever it seems convenient and when it'll bring them closer to the 200,000 dollars in stolen coins. These three characters, wonderfully written and acted, are an important column holding this film's roof up.Sergio Leone was very much the David Lean of Italy. He could set up beautiful landscape shots and cinematography tricks like few others could. That's part of the reason why so little can happen for so long and yet the tension mounts higher than most. The way he also contrasts long shots with close-ups and montages it all is sheer brilliance. His timing is also exquisite. He knows how long to go, when to cut, when to produce a long take, when to crop a short one, and so on and so forth.And I cannot leave out Ennio Morricone's music, which is even more famous than the movie itself. His main theme, which has been used in parodies and cultural references for more than forty years, is justifiably famous. But whereas it is usually used in parodies to produce a comical effect, here it fits the mood of the picture down to the bone. There's not a single weak cue of music in this marvelous soundtrack.But what's most remarkable about this movie is that it sustains itself for the entirety of its 160-minute length and throughout most of it, very little happens. There are long stretches - minutes upon minutes - where virtually nothing happens. Oftentimes there isn't any music. It's not just the suspense of waiting for Leone's trademark bursts of action; the cinematography and the montage and the directing are so taut and winded together that the audience cannot even force themselves to look away. And if one seeks proof, they have to look no further than the film's climax. Of course because it's a Western, it will have an obligatory final showdown. But consider this showdown. We have three men facing each other down and it goes on for four minutes. Four minutes and the actors are hardly even moving. The only real movement is the camera, which is locked-down, but montaging amongst what is very nearly static images. Coupled with Ennio Morricone's heart-thumping music, this showdown, where very little happens for so long, comes across as one of the most electrifying climaxes in cinema history. Sure the music helps a lot, but it's the directing by Sergio Leone that really makes this scene so intense.The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is most definitely one of the most important films of all time and it certainly has earned its immortality in the realm of the cinema. It is undoubtedly the greatest Spaghetti Western of them all and Sergio Leone's masterpiece. The first film is this trilogy, A Fistful of Dollars was nothing more than an off-beat, but fun remake of Yojimbo. The second film was also entertaining and fun. But the third movie is a masterpiece. Even at a great length of 160 minutes, and having most of it consumed by silence and stillness, the film never falters to goes on for too long. It goes on and when it does at last end, the audience is left craving for more. They can satisfy themselves in two ways a) seeking out Leone's director's cut, which is about twenty minutes longer and b) watching the movie again, something I have done and will continue to do many, many times.

The state that Sam lives in, in the film, is rather inept (witness the ease with which the rather bumbling Tuttle thwarts the authorities at almost every stage). Sam fails not because the state overpowers him, like Winston Smith to the Oceania authorities in 1984, but because his bumbling and idiocy is even more pathetic than the state's. In effect, Sam fails because he's even more inept and personally weak than the system that subjugates him- he wins the devolutionary race to the bottom (is a Lowest Common Denominator society the cause or result of its citizens?). This is especially true in contrast to De Niro's Tuttle; which augurs well for the citizens of their inept state; whereas the residents of the dismal Orwellian Oceania are doomed.The DVD package comes in three disks. Disk One has the Final Cut, in a 1.851 aspect ratio, as well as an audio commentary by director Gilliam. It is lucid, passionate, engaging, and truly a delight. Rare is the filmmaker, outside of Werner Herzog, who seems engaged by discussing both his film, its circumstances, and its art. Gilliam also dispels the myth that the film was named after the title song, Aquarela Do Brasil; instead claiming the title was gotten first (after a dream Gilliam had of the film's opening in a rain forest about to be techno-plundered) and the song added afterwards. It's interesting that in the few dozen reviews I looked at of this film, not a single critic gives the correct provenance for the film's title- even after claiming to have reviewed the DVD. The transfer is very good, and Gilliam gives so much engaging information that it almost makes the special features on Disk Two seem persiflage by comparison. That disk has two excellent documentaries- a contemporaneous 30 minute long What is Brazil? film that serves as a de facto Making Of featurette, and a 60 minute film, called The Battle Of Brazil, that details the film's struggles against its studio, Universal, and its idiotic empty suits, as well as a piece of grandstanding by the Los Angeles Film Critics Society (of which host and film critic Jack Mathews was part of), which chose Brazil as best film of the year to force the studio to release the full version. Other features include the theatrical trailer, storyboards and assorted crew recollections and discussions of the film. Disk Three has the bowdlerized 94 minute version, and a commentary by David Morgan- a film expert on the works and career of Gilliam. While he is dutiful in pointing out when and where the two films diverge, Morgan is rather useless in discussing other aspects of the film, like some of the moments that are unaffected by the changes, and a few actual improvements- such as the substitution of a few close-ups for long shots, or certain angles the camera shoots at, which give a deeper 'in' to the 'moment.' His high point is catching the biggest error Gilliam's bowdlerizers made- leaving in the 'dream sequence' shot of Tuttle getting devoured by windblown newspapers. In the longer version we see this as one of the first hints that Sam's 'escape' from captivity is not real. But, in this version, where the escape is 'real,' Tuttle's demise is more than incongruous, it's an actual thumb in the eye. He follows that up by ending his commentary asking which of the two films is the more subversive- the bowdlerized cut which suggests that power can be subverted, or the final cut which shows the only 'escape' from authoritarianism is death or insanity?As for the film itself, there is no great nor memorable camera work to speak of- the odd angles Gilliam uses are all rather standard fare from his Python days, for this film is almost wholly dependent upon the great screenplay by Gilliam, playwright Tom Stoppard, and Charles McKeown, as well as some truly outstanding (and subtle) comic acting by the stars and supporting cast, which included Ian Holm, Bob Hoskins, Ian Richardson, Peter Vaughan, and Jim Broadbent. And, when I say 'acting,' I truly mean it. This is acting not built on melodramatic high points, but on often fleeting moments of sardonism where the turn of an eye, or the tic in a face can convey something, both from the main and supporting cast. Pryce, as example, was relatively unknown before this film, while De Niro was in his post-Taxi Driver-Raging Bull heyday as 'the greatest actor in the world,' yet it is Pryce's acting that dominates the film, whereas De Niro's is a supporting role in all measures of the term.Brazil is a theatrical film that is unique. Despite constant and wrongheaded comparisons to other dystopias, it is a film that clearly inspired later filmmakers- most notably Canada's Guy Maddin. But, it also clearly had an inspiration few have noticed- the classic 1967 British television series, The Prisoner. Both works essentially end with the destruction of the individual (even if The Prisoner's lead character 'escapes'- he still is destroyed for he is revealed as the villain) in response to modern society. The only essential difference is that more inept and cowardly Sam Lowry never quite realizes he's a prisoner in The Village (or perhaps does, but refuses his reality, thereby deepening his pathos).

This is especially true in contrast to De Niro's Tuttle; which augurs well for the citizens of their inept state; whereas the residents of the dismal Orwellian Oceania are doomed.The DVD package comes in three disks. Disk One has the Final Cut, in a 1.851 aspect ratio, as well as an audio commentary by director Gilliam. It is lucid, passionate, engaging, and truly a delight. Rare is the filmmaker, outside of Werner Herzog, who seems engaged by discussing both his film, its circumstances, and its art. Gilliam also dispels the myth that the film was named after the title song, Aquarela Do Brasil; instead claiming the title was gotten first (after a dream Gilliam had of the film's opening in a rain forest about to be techno-plundered) and the song added afterwards. It's interesting that in the few dozen reviews I looked at of this film, not a single critic gives the correct provenance for the film's title- even after claiming to have reviewed the DVD. The transfer is very good, and Gilliam gives so much engaging information that it almost makes the special features on Disk Two seem persiflage by comparison. That disk has two excellent documentaries- a contemporaneous 30 minute long What is Brazil? film that serves as a de facto Making Of featurette, and a 60 minute film, called The Battle Of Brazil, that details the film's struggles against its studio, Universal, and its idiotic empty suits, as well as a piece of grandstanding by the Los Angeles Film Critics Society (of which host and film critic Jack Mathews was part of), which chose Brazil as best film of the year to force the studio to release the full version. Other features include the theatrical trailer, storyboards and assorted crew recollections and discussions of the film. Disk Three has the bowdlerized 94 minute version, and a commentary by David Morgan- a film expert on the works and career of Gilliam. While he is dutiful in pointing out when and where the two films diverge, Morgan is rather useless in discussing other aspects of the film, like some of the moments that are unaffected by the changes, and a few actual improvements- such as the substitution of a few close-ups for long shots, or certain angles the camera shoots at, which give a deeper 'in' to the 'moment.' His high point is catching the biggest error Gilliam's bowdlerizers made- leaving in the 'dream sequence' shot of Tuttle getting devoured by windblown newspapers. In the longer version we see this as one of the first hints that Sam's 'escape' from captivity is not real. But, in this version, where the escape is 'real,' Tuttle's demise is more than incongruous, it's an actual thumb in the eye. He follows that up by ending his commentary asking which of the two films is the more subversive- the bowdlerized cut which suggests that power can be subverted, or the final cut which shows the only 'escape' from authoritarianism is death or insanity?As for the film itself, there is no great nor memorable camera work to speak of- the odd angles Gilliam uses are all rather standard fare from his Python days, for this film is almost wholly dependent upon the great screenplay by Gilliam, playwright Tom Stoppard, and Charles McKeown, as well as some truly outstanding (and subtle) comic acting by the stars and supporting cast, which included Ian Holm, Bob Hoskins, Ian Richardson, Peter Vaughan, and Jim Broadbent. And, when I say 'acting,' I truly mean it. This is acting not built on melodramatic high points, but on often fleeting moments of sardonism where the turn of an eye, or the tic in a face can convey something, both from the main and supporting cast. Pryce, as example, was relatively unknown before this film, while De Niro was in his post-Taxi Driver-Raging Bull heyday as 'the greatest actor in the world,' yet it is Pryce's acting that dominates the film, whereas De Niro's is a supporting role in all measures of the term.Brazil is a theatrical film that is unique. Despite constant and wrongheaded comparisons to other dystopias, it is a film that clearly inspired later filmmakers- most notably Canada's Guy Maddin. But, it also clearly had an inspiration few have noticed- the classic 1967 British television series, The Prisoner. Both works essentially end with the destruction of the individual (even if The Prisoner's lead character 'escapes'- he still is destroyed for he is revealed as the villain) in response to modern society. The only essential difference is that more inept and cowardly Sam Lowry never quite realizes he's a prisoner in The Village (or perhaps does, but refuses his reality, thereby deepening his pathos). All in all, The Criterion Collection's DVD set of the film is equal to the film it presents, and that is something all cinemaphiles can celebrate. Get to it!

It is also a poor transfer of Kipling's novel to the screen, for a variety of reasons.The raison d'être for this movie would appear to be the competition that television was posing at the time. One of the things Hollywood did to lure audiences away from their little box at home was to give them things that the TV could not provide bright Technicolor, as in this movie, and often, colorful travelogues, either as short features between movies or as part of the movies themselves. The most famous example of this is Around the World in 80 Days, with used Verne's novel as an excuse for shooting colorful and exotic scenes around the world. This movie, if you watch the trailer, was presented as that, though it doesn't deliver the way Around the World did. A lot of the scenes are, quite obviously, either filmed on a sound stage altogether or filmed on a sound stage and then projected against film that was shot in India. Unfortunately, in both cases the result looks strangely amateurish for a big studio, big budget film. The landslide scene near the end that kills the rebel soldiers is probably the most obvious example of bad use of back projection, but there are others.The fact that the visuals were meant to be the big attraction may account for the fact that other aspects got short-changed.First, the casting.I disagree with some of the other posters on here. Dean Stockwell is generally inadequate as Kim. Far too often he just rushes through his lines as if they had been learned by heart and not understood. He's good in the last scene with the dying Lama, but too often he doesn't seem to be a real person expressing his feelings; he just sounds like a mediocre actor reciting lines.Part of the problem here, though, are those lines. The dialog is far too often stilted when it shouldn't be. In the novel, Kipling makes it very clear when his characters are speaking their native language, which they of course speak fluently, and when they are speaking a language they have learned (usually English) and over which they don't have the same command. The movie never bothered to figure out how to do this, and sometimes the characters speak in a very stilted fashion when they would clearly be speaking their native language, which makes them look foolish even when the lines are well delivered.Another problem with Stockwell that is not his fault is that the time frame of Kipling's novel has been truncated. In the book, Kim goes to school for three years, aging from a child of 15 to a young man of 18 before he gets involved in the intrigue at the end. This makes it quite believable in the novel. In the movie, Kim is still barely 15 when it all takes place - I assume so that they did not have to get another actor to play the older Kim - and it stretches credulity. To make matters worse, Hurree Chunder is killed off, unlike in the novel, so Kim is left to organize a lot of the dealings with the Russian and French spies, which really strains belief.Chunder is probably killed off so that Mahbub Ali (Errol Flynn) can play a more important role than in the novel. He, rather than Chunder, now organizes the routing of the Russians - though that episode is completely rewritten and becomes much less interesting - and not at all funny, which it is in the novel.It's also unfortunate that Chunder is killed off because Cecil Kelloway, who plays him, definitely gives the best performance in the movie. Flynn could have been great had he exuded the same charm and charisma that made him a star in the 1930s, but we seldom get to see any of that in this movie. The obvious comparison would be The Prince and the Pauper, in which Flynn also played against a boy who faced great travails. There he was at his best, as were the Mauch twins, who do a much more natural job of delivering dialog than Stockwell does.The change from the novel that I found most aggravating was the end. (Spoiler alert here.) In the novel, the Lama comes to an understanding of the goal he has been seeking, actually finds a river, and then comes to understand the nature of the river he seeks, which could be anywhere. He is quite alive at the end of the novel, and explains his entire philosophy in a very moving fashion. Kim will now have to decide, having finished school, whether he will continue to follow him or go back to the English. In the movie, the Lama has the hallucination of a river and dies, which makes him look crazy. Mahbub Ali then takes Kim to the English, deciding his future - something that Kipling's Mahbub Ali would never have done. In general, the Lama's role as a philosopher is greatly reduced in the movie, again, I suppose, because the attraction was to be the visuals and not the dialog. Decades later Steven Spielberg showed, with Star Wars, that great visuals did not mean intellectual dialog had to be sacrificed, but Victor Seville, who directed this Kim, was no Spielberg.So, for those who know the novel, this will be a real disappointment. It could have been better, with that budget, but it would have had to have been given to a better director and not approached as a Technicolor travelogue.But even for those who have not read the novel, there are too many weak points to make this anything other than sporadically interesting as a movie.

In the novel, Kipling makes it very clear when his characters are speaking their native language, which they of course speak fluently, and when they are speaking a language they have learned (usually English) and over which they don't have the same command. The movie never bothered to figure out how to do this, and sometimes the characters speak in a very stilted fashion when they would clearly be speaking their native language, which makes them look foolish even when the lines are well delivered.Another problem with Stockwell that is not his fault is that the time frame of Kipling's novel has been truncated. In the book, Kim goes to school for three years, aging from a child of 15 to a young man of 18 before he gets involved in the intrigue at the end. This makes it quite believable in the novel. In the movie, Kim is still barely 15 when it all takes place - I assume so that they did not have to get another actor to play the older Kim - and it stretches credulity. To make matters worse, Hurree Chunder is killed off, unlike in the novel, so Kim is left to organize a lot of the dealings with the Russian and French spies, which really strains belief.Chunder is probably killed off so that Mahbub Ali (Errol Flynn) can play a more important role than in the novel. He, rather than Chunder, now organizes the routing of the Russians - though that episode is completely rewritten and becomes much less interesting - and not at all funny, which it is in the novel.It's also unfortunate that Chunder is killed off because Cecil Kelloway, who plays him, definitely gives the best performance in the movie. Flynn could have been great had he exuded the same charm and charisma that made him a star in the 1930s, but we seldom get to see any of that in this movie. The obvious comparison would be The Prince and the Pauper, in which Flynn also played against a boy who faced great travails. There he was at his best, as were the Mauch twins, who do a much more natural job of delivering dialog than Stockwell does.The change from the novel that I found most aggravating was the end. (Spoiler alert here.) In the novel, the Lama comes to an understanding of the goal he has been seeking, actually finds a river, and then comes to understand the nature of the river he seeks, which could be anywhere. He is quite alive at the end of the novel, and explains his entire philosophy in a very moving fashion. Kim will now have to decide, having finished school, whether he will continue to follow him or go back to the English. In the movie, the Lama has the hallucination of a river and dies, which makes him look crazy. Mahbub Ali then takes Kim to the English, deciding his future - something that Kipling's Mahbub Ali would never have done. In general, the Lama's role as a philosopher is greatly reduced in the movie, again, I suppose, because the attraction was to be the visuals and not the dialog. Decades later Steven Spielberg showed, with Star Wars, that great visuals did not mean intellectual dialog had to be sacrificed, but Victor Seville, who directed this Kim, was no Spielberg.So, for those who know the novel, this will be a real disappointment. It could have been better, with that budget, but it would have had to have been given to a better director and not approached as a Technicolor travelogue.But even for those who have not read the novel, there are too many weak points to make this anything other than sporadically interesting as a movie.

It is also a poor transfer of Kipling's novel to the screen, for a variety of reasons.The raison d'être for this movie would appear to be the competition that television was posing at the time. One of the things Hollywood did to lure audiences away from their little box at home was to give them things that the TV could not provide bright Technicolor, as in this movie, and often, colorful travelogues, either as short features between movies or as part of the movies themselves. The most famous example of this is Around the World in 80 Days, with used Verne's novel as an excuse for shooting colorful and exotic scenes around the world. This movie, if you watch the trailer, was presented as that, though it doesn't deliver the way Around the World did. A lot of the scenes are, quite obviously, either filmed on a sound stage altogether or filmed on a sound stage and then projected against film that was shot in India. Unfortunately, in both cases the result looks strangely amateurish for a big studio, big budget film. The landslide scene near the end that kills the rebel soldiers is probably the most obvious example of bad use of back projection, but there are others.The fact that the visuals were meant to be the big attraction may account for the fact that other aspects got short-changed.First, the casting.I disagree with some of the other posters on here. Dean Stockwell is generally inadequate as Kim. Far too often he just rushes through his lines as if they had been learned by heart and not understood. He's good in the last scene with the dying Lama, but too often he doesn't seem to be a real person expressing his feelings; he just sounds like a mediocre actor reciting lines.Part of the problem here, though, are those lines.

When watching Conan I found I was kept entertained the whole way through, but under real analysis the movie isn't really that good.I won't spoil the plot for you but it's relatively simple. Just a basic villain kills protagonist's father, protagonist grows up in harsh conditions and fights back basically. Sure there is a bit more to it then that but nothing that particularly great. However I will say that the few twists in the film keep it entertaining. Conan played by the now legend Arnold Schwarzenegger is the first in the movie's flaws. The character has basically no personality in this adaptation(though to be fair he was never exactly a greatly personified character in the first place) besides being a brute, and Arnold's acting is laughable at this point.Then you have Valeria played by dancer Sandahl Bergman(who admittedly has a pretty nice body but is ultimately boring and unimpressive). She's a bit better at acting(and her character has a tad bit more personality she's smart, tough, but also sensitive) but that's not saying much not to mention the way they show her personality is rather clumsy, and the sidekick Rexor played by Ben Davidson leaves no impression. The only other real players in the movie are Mako as Akiro the wizard and narrator(who is very entertaining in a campy way here) and James Earl Jones as Thulsa Doom(who delivers the only genuinely good acting performance in the movie).So that's how the cast and acting fares Relatively wooden and uninteresting.

In the end the movie is just a basic sword and sorcery movie that entertains on the basic action and technical level but fails for the most part on the dramatic end.

By this time, he is no longer dating Ali, who has fallen for someone else. Meanwhile, Mr. Miyagi receives a letter that was sent from his native Okinawa. Miyagi learns that his father is very ill, so Miyagi prepares to fly to his homeland to see him.Daniel accompanies Miyagi to Okinawa, where a man named Sato is waiting for them. Sato was Miyagi's best friend when they were younger, but the two had a falling out over a girl that they both loved. Sato wanted to fight, but Miyagi didn't. As a result, Miyagi left Okinawa and has not been back until now. Sato has waited years for Miyagi's return and wastes no time in trying to get Miyagi to fight him. Miyagi, as usual, wants no part of any violent acts. Will these two masters of karate have a duel to settle their differences? As for Daniel, he has his own problem with Sato's nephew, Chozen. Chozen is very skillful when it comes to karate, having learned from his uncle, and he takes an instant dislike to Daniel, harassing him every chance he gets. It's not all bad for Daniel, who strikes up a relationship with a girl named Kumiko. Just like before with Ali, Daniel becomes close with Kumiko and they spend time together.As usual, Pat Morita and Ralph Macchio turn in enjoyable performances, as does the whole cast.

Such high culture is not something that most people experience on an everyday basis but it has a subtle, pervasive influence on all our lives. The movie wants to bring us on a journey through questions on where we come from, where we are now and where we are going from a Western perspective. The movie is ambiguous because it does not seek to provide answers but asks us to think about how these deep spiritual questions fit into the Western world view.Nothing in the film hints at the existence of other cultural views. This is not a criticism of the film, this is just what the film is about. In the near future presented to us Western culture is all triumphant. Science and engineering are raising Man to new heights. The people portrayed in the movie appear confident about the intellectual\/spiritual basis on which their world is constructed. People are calm, measured and rational.

He's the good guy again; the hero again; he's never got punched but he kicks and punches lots of guys with the little help of the editor who makes his moves even faster. This movie resembles On Deadly Ground, so here we have Seagal saving the Earth of the bloody hands of powerful and corrupt business man who are destroying rivers, oceans and trees and all. The major difference between Fire Down Below and On Deadly Ground is the quality of the movie (for some reason I like On Deadly...) and the violence\/action. While action is dumb and so non breathtaking here, on the previous film was something great, although at times badly used or excessive, especially towards older people, it was literally no country for old men (e.g. the old friend of Seagal tortured and killed in 1994 film). In Fire Down Below the same thing happens but it is only implied, nothing is shown on screen and other times it's only a threat.In the story Seagal is a Environmental agent who goes to a little town in Kentucky investigate the murder of his friend who discovered that a powerful company, owned by Orin Hanner Sr. (Kris Kristofferson), is being paid to dump toxic waste into an abandoned coal mine shaft. With the assistance of a Reverend (Levon Helm) and a woman (Marg Helgenberger) and some other residents Segal is gonna find the truth and kicks some villains.The lack of action ruined this movie. The lack of violence ruined this movie. The lack of someone able to kick Seagal on the face ruined this and almost all Seagal's movies. The great vantage of this against On Deadly Ground is the quotes delivered by Seagal, funny things and for incredible as it might sound these quotes are not unintentionally laughable, they're there for the purpose of being funny. The scene in the casino when Seagal takes down 4 security guys trying to arrest Kristofferson is amazingly funny. I'll not say this was Seagal's worst film, but perhaps his performance was not good enough and the whole supporting cast was very effective and good compared to him. Marg Helgenberger was great, her part was very interesting as the forsaken woman of the town; Stephen Lang plays his usual sinister figure in a twisted character; Kristofferson was quite good and funny; and Levon Helm was the best on scene. The movie includes some bad acting from Brad Hunt (he plays the son of Kristofferson) whose presence is annoying, and some wasted acting by Harry Dean Stanton and Richard Masur (who appears in the beginning in some flashbacks), seriously they deserved a better flick to appear.

Both DVDs offer enhanced versions of the film. The Wellspring DVD still has some dirt and splotchiness, although the colors are well restored. And unlike Criterion, Wellspring uses gold subtitles, which are easier to read than the white subtitles Criterion uses. The DVD I saw has production notes, the film in a 1.851 aspect ratio, a restoration demonstration, and two film trailers. The chief difference lies in the commentaries. The Criterion version has only one commentary by film historian Stephen Prince, and has a documentary on Kurosawa called AK, by French filmmaker Chris Marker, as well as Toho Studios It Is Wonderful To Create series of documentaries on Kurosawa. By contrast, Wellspring has no featurettes, but a second film commentary, by film producer Peter Grilli. Grilli's commentary is flat and uninvolving, filled with sweeping generalities about film, in general, and this one specifically,; as well delivering few specifics on Ran, much less individual scenes and moments- either within the diegetic reality, or in the making of the film. It is also punctuated by several minutes long periods of silences. It begs the question of why was this person hired to do the commentary? The second commentary is also by Stephen Prince, and it is reportedly similar, but not exactly the same, as the later commentary he did for Criterion. Prince is a very hit and miss commentarian. This offering is one of his better ones. While he always trends to over-prepare and come across as bland and reading notes, this commentary is quite scene specific, and Prince seems to have loosened up a bit.Overall, the screenplay by Kurosawa, Masato Ide, and Hideo Oguni is a good one, although, as mentioned before, a better fleshing out of the characters was needed. The cinematography by Asakazu Nakai, Takao Saitō, Masaharu Ueda shows that good scenery alone does not make for great cinematography. One need only look at films like Sean Penn's Into The Wild or Walter Salles' The Motorcycle Diaries to see that beautiful mountainscapes do not equal great art. Kurosawa's men, by contrast, show how framing and flattening out imagery with telephoto lenses can render reality into a sort of Japanese flat art depiction of the world. This also illustrates the superfluity and flat out wrongheadedness of most critical writing on the use of certain types of cameras or lenses to get certain effects, in this film and in general. Why? Because the flattening of images (such as in the openings ceremonial scenes in the mountains, or in certain interior ceremonial shots, especially when the frame is crowded) is not important for how it is achieved, but for what it imparts to the viewer. In these cases, the flattening of images into an almost Classical Oriental illustration makes the objects and characters in the frame seem to be closer to each other (sometimes almost on top of each other) than they really are in the internal reality of the film's narrative, which, in turn, makes the scenes seem and feel almost claustrophobic. This, then, makes the viewer feel what the characters do emotionally, as they are uneased by the internal circumstances and crowding, just as the viewer is by the external composition on screen. Thus, viewers understand the aggression on screen viscerally, cued by what amounts to a subliminal visual testosterone (think of the effect crowding has on male interactions at sporting events, or in cases of road rage). That these effects are achieved via a certain lens or camera technique are, again, far less important than what they impart into the viewer. That so few critics understand this about art, in general, and cinema, in particular, is typical of just why so much art and criticism is so bad, repetitive, and dependent upon the seeking out of artistic intent, rather than artistic effect. Why? Because intent is rather a simplistic declaration, whereas effect is a multifarious cogitation. There are also several jumpcuts in the film that depict emotional fragility of characters and moments. These all work well, and are employed so well that one often does not notice them, except subliminally, or upon rewatch. The score by Tôru Takemitsu has an otherworldly feel that really meshes beautifully with the images. It also is obviously influenced- at least emotionally- by Jerry Goldsmith's landmark score for The Planet Of The Apes.Oftentimes, when an artist has been as consistently great as Kurosawa was, his bar is set so high in expectation of ineffably great things that when one gets merely demonstrably terrific stuff from him, well, it seems wanting, although from lesser lights it would be praised sky high. Ran is a film that falls just shy of Kurosawa's greatest works, but stands leagues above the vast majority of the films we all watch. If that praise seems faint, then catch it when it falls onto you.

Ran is a film that falls just shy of Kurosawa's greatest works, but stands leagues above the vast majority of the films we all watch. If that praise seems faint, then catch it when it falls onto you.

Both DVDs offer enhanced versions of the film. The Wellspring DVD still has some dirt and splotchiness, although the colors are well restored. And unlike Criterion, Wellspring uses gold subtitles, which are easier to read than the white subtitles Criterion uses. The DVD I saw has production notes, the film in a 1.851 aspect ratio, a restoration demonstration, and two film trailers. The chief difference lies in the commentaries. The Criterion version has only one commentary by film historian Stephen Prince, and has a documentary on Kurosawa called AK, by French filmmaker Chris Marker, as well as Toho Studios It Is Wonderful To Create series of documentaries on Kurosawa. By contrast, Wellspring has no featurettes, but a second film commentary, by film producer Peter Grilli. Grilli's commentary is flat and uninvolving, filled with sweeping generalities about film, in general, and this one specifically,; as well delivering few specifics on Ran, much less individual scenes and moments- either within the diegetic reality, or in the making of the film. It is also punctuated by several minutes long periods of silences. It begs the question of why was this person hired to do the commentary? The second commentary is also by Stephen Prince, and it is reportedly similar, but not exactly the same, as the later commentary he did for Criterion. Prince is a very hit and miss commentarian. This offering is one of his better ones. While he always trends to over-prepare and come across as bland and reading notes, this commentary is quite scene specific, and Prince seems to have loosened up a bit.Overall, the screenplay by Kurosawa, Masato Ide, and Hideo Oguni is a good one, although, as mentioned before, a better fleshing out of the characters was needed. The cinematography by Asakazu Nakai, Takao Saitō, Masaharu Ueda shows that good scenery alone does not make for great cinematography. One need only look at films like Sean Penn's Into The Wild or Walter Salles' The Motorcycle Diaries to see that beautiful mountainscapes do not equal great art. Kurosawa's men, by contrast, show how framing and flattening out imagery with telephoto lenses can render reality into a sort of Japanese flat art depiction of the world. This also illustrates the superfluity and flat out wrongheadedness of most critical writing on the use of certain types of cameras or lenses to get certain effects, in this film and in general. Why? Because the flattening of images (such as in the openings ceremonial scenes in the mountains, or in certain interior ceremonial shots, especially when the frame is crowded) is not important for how it is achieved, but for what it imparts to the viewer. In these cases, the flattening of images into an almost Classical Oriental illustration makes the objects and characters in the frame seem to be closer to each other (sometimes almost on top of each other) than they really are in the internal reality of the film's narrative, which, in turn, makes the scenes seem and feel almost claustrophobic. This, then, makes the viewer feel what the characters do emotionally, as they are uneased by the internal circumstances and crowding, just as the viewer is by the external composition on screen. Thus, viewers understand the aggression on screen viscerally, cued by what amounts to a subliminal visual testosterone (think of the effect crowding has on male interactions at sporting events, or in cases of road rage). That these effects are achieved via a certain lens or camera technique are, again, far less important than what they impart into the viewer. That so few critics understand this about art, in general, and cinema, in particular, is typical of just why so much art and criticism is so bad, repetitive, and dependent upon the seeking out of artistic intent, rather than artistic effect. Why? Because intent is rather a simplistic declaration, whereas effect is a multifarious cogitation. There are also several jumpcuts in the film that depict emotional fragility of characters and moments. These all work well, and are employed so well that one often does not notice them, except subliminally, or upon rewatch. The score by Tôru Takemitsu has an otherworldly feel that really meshes beautifully with the images. It also is obviously influenced- at least emotionally- by Jerry Goldsmith's landmark score for The Planet Of The Apes.Oftentimes, when an artist has been as consistently great as Kurosawa was, his bar is set so high in expectation of ineffably great things that when one gets merely demonstrably terrific stuff from him, well, it seems wanting, although from lesser lights it would be praised sky high.

It is three hours in length, it is based on a novel written in 1844 documenting the rise and fall of an Irishman who becomes part of 18th century English nobility, and it stars no one popular. But there is one compelling reason that dwarfs all excuses not to watch the film - it is directed by the late Stanley Kubrick. The director of influential film masterpieces such as 2001 A Space Odyssey (1968), Dr. Strangelove (1964), and A Clockwork Orange (1971), Kubrick is easily one of the greatest filmmakers of our time.Barry Lyndon is probably Kubrick's most underrated film, an extraordinary picture that so vividly evokes the time and mood of a distant past that one might have been inclined to believe that Kubrick had actually taken the hassle to travel back in time to film this. Shot by cinematographer John Alcott, who wins one of the film's four Oscars, Barry Lyndon is as beautiful as films get. Picturesque views of medieval England are captured with a wide lens that frequently zooms away from a focal point, giving 'eye-opening' visuals of classy architecture and elegiac costumes lived in and worn respectively by the noble people.Tremendous effort is made to film most of the interior scenes in natural light and in the 'enchanting hour' when everything radiates with misty perfection. Yet the most technically impressive aspect of Barry Lyndon remains to be the filming of interiors at night with the creative use of strategically-positioned candlelights which lend an almost warm, surreal touch to the film's already organic quality. Kubrick's eye for detail and his quest for the perfect shot (whose obsession with them is well-documented later in his career) will reward patient viewers because Barry Lyndon is simply innovative filmmaking in an old-fashioned setting.Ryan O'Neal plays the titular character Barry Lyndon opposite Marisa Berenson who is remarkable in her role as the widowed Lady Lyndon. Adapted from William Makepeace Thackeray's picaresque novel and written for the screen by Kubrick himself, the film is smartly split into two major acts - the unexpected rise of Redmond Barry who later becomes Barry Lyndon, and the decline of the latter whose acrimonious relationship with his stepson Lord Bullingdon primarily leads to his inevitable downfall.Despite the subject matter, Barry Lyndon is more engaging than one might have expected. Kubrick's use of classical music is a major reason and it could not have been more apt here with great selections like Handel's Sarabande. Another factor is the inclusion of several sequences of farcical duels between Barry and his 'nemesis' and war battles which feature brilliant tracking shots.Kubrick's films are mostly devoid of real emotions; they are mechanical, cold observations of society that are seldom optimistic. Barry Lyndon is no exception. Its frozen characters seem unable to dictate their lives; they feel trapped in Kubrick's masterful manipulation of a medium that so rarely embraces such a genre. Highly recommended, Barry Lyndon is cinema at its purest, and is without a doubt one of its great achievements.SCORE 9.5\/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!
