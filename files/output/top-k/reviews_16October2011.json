Then once I saw those minutes, I began to enjoy most of the film. It's difficult to do a creature feature well, and I think the film is being unintentionally funny a lot of the time. Especially when the actors it's boasting are Jennifer Lopez and Ice Cube. There's almost more to laugh at than be scared of.I have no problem at all with Lopez and Ice Cube. I haven't seen a lot of Jennifer Lopez's work, and I adore Ice Cube in pretty much everything he's in. He's one of those actors where if he's in a bad movie he himself isn't bad the movie, the directing, the screenplay, or whatever setback is bad. I'm just saying that when you see those two playing a couple in a horror film it's hard to take it seriously. Thankfully - they're not the reason this film isn't perfect.The story revolves around a documentary crew, Terri (Lopez), Danny (Cube), Denise (Kari), Gary (Wilson), Warren (Hyde), and Steven (Stoltz), that venture out into the jungle hoping to garner footage of a rare tribe called Shirishama. While traveling on the Amazon River, the crew finds a stranded boater named Sarone (Voight) who knows about the tribe, but acts very unsettling throughout most of the first half.Turns out that Sarone is searching for an anaconda, and is hoping to catch one alive in order to obtain a very large sum of money. He gets the whole crew involved, and doesn't really care who lives or who dies. The thought of being out in the middle of the jungle is creepy - yet it proposes a good campy quality Anaconda hits a high note with.Background scenery is pushed to the foreground here. We get beautiful shots of swamps (yes, swamps), incredible angles of trees, and even some very eerie and suspenseful underwater shots. Director Luis Llosa explores every possible angle of the setting so that not only is this a creepy B movie, but a stylish one as well.When it comes to the snake - the film begins to lose some of its redeeming qualities. There is a scene where very many snakes flood the boat. Unable to distinguish real from fake due to the small stature of the beasts, my only guess is that they were in fact real. When the anaconda makes his first appearance, it looks undeniably animatronic and the CGI used when the beast swallows its first prey is pathetic. Anaconda was made with a budget over $40 million, so this snake's execution is one of two things (1) maybe the hefty budget didn't get them very far after all, or (2, the much plausible explanation) it was supposed to look cheap and fake to give a nod to old creature-features we would've seen Saturday at 1030pm on Svengoolie.Jon Voight is probably the highest point in the film. His unsettling approach to the crew rubs off on the audience almost making them a little scared as well. His face alone reminds me of Gary Busey on a bad day, or Nick Nolte after one too many. The other members of the documentary crew, like Ice Cube and Owen Wilson, are severely underused, and but their presence is enough for personal satisfaction.The final scene where its two on one with the anaconda is great popcorn fun, and after the film you feel you've spent an hour and a half back in time. Unfortunately, Anaconda was blown out of proportion once the sequel came. After the first two theatrical films were released, the name and story became a Syfy franchise. Currently, in 2011, we have four Anaconda films including this one. I'm sure in five years we'll have two more to go along with it. The bad thing about a good B movie idea is it can be abused with a single sequel.Starring Jennifer Lopez, Ice Cube, Jon Voight, Eric Stoltz, Owen Wilson, Jonathan Hyde, and Kari Wuhrer.

Men line up in formation on opposing sides, and shoot at each other in wide open fields with no cover or protection. I have no idea why battles like this were ever deemed to be practical in the first place. I would think fighting guerrilla style would have a lot more merit if your objective is to actually kill the enemy and win without getting killed yourself.Aside from whatever historical inaccuracies might be present, I thought this was an effective story. Criticisms of Matthew Broderick in the lead role are somewhat misplaced in my view, once one gets past the fact that he's Matthew Broderick. About the same age as the character he portrays, I think he grows into the role of a Union Colonel over the course of the story, with each humanistic stand he takes for his troops showing the growth of his stature. The confrontation with the quartermaster was particularly impressive, while his bribery of General Harker (Bob Gunton) was instructive in the way leaders get their way when all reasonable attempts fail.Denzel Washington won his first Oscar in a break-out role here, but to my mind, any of his fellow actors could have been honored just as well. Morgan Freeman (Rawlins) and Andre Braugher (Thomas Searles) were equally impressive, and except for somewhat less screen time, Jihmi Kennedy (Sharts) was also quite effective. Colonel Shaw's mission was to turn this rag-tag band into an effective fighting regiment, and when he won them over by tearing up his own pay voucher, you knew that he had finally won their trust.What I admire about the film is the way it places in context the black man's struggle for freedom and identity, while showing how white men of courage and conviction helped achieve that goal. It's easy to decry a film as racist when it's telling a story about racism, and that's a beef I have with critics who are fixated on only one side of the story. Together, white and black men have been able to stand side by side over the course of history to right the wrongs of the past, and failure to recognize this is what stands in the way of a truly color blind society.

It's less showy in its set pieces, but still it provides its moments of shocks and surreal imagery (like the dream sequences), but for most part it's a gripping psychological mystery teaser that only goes for cheap frights and special effects in its possessed fright-fest finale.

Very different in style and totally ignores the abysmal first sequel, where this entry does continue on from the first film with characters returning, like Lieutenant Kinderman, Father Dyer and Father Karras with Jason Millar reprising the role. Kinderman is played respectfully by George C. Scott in what is a tour de force performance. His witty exchanges with Ed Flander's character Father Dyer and the hospital cell confrontations with Brad Dourif's psychotic serial killer character were definitely a highlight. Also its thick on dark atmospherics, with a lingering uneasiness and it has one of the most chilling set-pieces that simply make you jump. What we get is Blatty's vision, which is adapted of his novel Legion. Quite story driven, where it relies on its wordy script (sometimes over-explaining details) and brooding moodiness as this investigation becomes a graphic, if silly standoff between good and evil. It's less showy in its set pieces, but still it provides its moments of shocks and surreal imagery (like the dream sequences), but for most part it's a gripping psychological mystery teaser that only goes for cheap frights and special effects in its possessed fright-fest finale.

He's so filled with anxiety that he has trouble with his bowels and is a nervous wreck.Neeson joins a psychiatrist's group therapy session and is referred to a doc who gives him a barium enema and eventually becomes his lover. That would be Sandra Bullock.It's a comedy and it has its moments. Neeson handles the ludic elements well, which is a bit of a surprise considering how much drama he's done. Example At the first meeting of the therapy group, Neeson listens barely interested while the others runs through their usual complaints. One patient has an impulse to do something improper in public so he deals with it by biting his hand. Another's wife always buys the flavor of ice cream that she KNOWS he hates because it has a chemical taste. Finally the leader says, We haven't heard from Charlie here. And Neeson matter-of-factly describes his feelings having a revolver shoved up his rear end while he's stretched out on a table like a Cornish rock hen. There is a moment of silence.And, later, when he meets Oliver Platt -- he of the ominous beard and barely contained anger, Platt does nothing but stare at him without blinking. Neeson, a neural shambles, has taken more tranquilizers than was wise, plus some booze on top of it, and he stares back, hardly able to keep awake. Even when Platt pulls an automatic and aims it at Neeson's face, his eyes half close and he drifts off. The monumental tranquility amazes and impresses Platt.It's a low-key comedy that aims mostly for smiles rather than laughs and it wants to charm the audience -- rather like Moonstruck and Analyze This did in the previous two years.

She does a character part well in Infamous, in which she was Harper Lee, but when left to her own devices she's not really very convincing.Part of whatever success the movie has, as comedy, is due to Liam Neeson's physical structure.

He is accompanied on his search by his 7 year old son. The two actors who play these roles are not professional actors and yet they turn in performances of the century. The plot points, direction, writing, and cinematography, of this masterpiece are without equal. The portrayal of the misery and desperation of those who survived WWII leaves a pit in your stomach. Most profound is the relationship between the father and son and their journey together to find his stolen bicycle so that he can make money and feed his family again. This is a movie without a climax. And that's a big part of what makes it great. The ending is something you could never imagine, and will never forget once you've experienced it. I will only say one more thing about it's conclusion. There are some things more heartbreaking than the tragic loss of life. In this movie, that something more heartbreaking than the tragic loss of life, is the tragedy of continuing to live after you've lost everything.

The Lion King is the Disney Renaissance period at its pinnacle and probably the last hand-drawn Disney classic.Now, I won't mention Pixar and the 3D animated features again, because I want, for once, to take a big plunge and get back to that magical year that was 1994. Disney Renaissance was this unexpected animated streak that started with The Little Mermaid and brought up memorable masterpieces such as Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, which finally elevated the world of Animation to the same level of spectacular greatness and respectability than live-action films. But I think there are two words that get often mixed up  masterpieces and classics, a movie can be an excellent technical accomplishment but for some reasons, it gets less recognition than a minor film. I like Mermaid, the two B's and I'm a big fan of Aladdin, they might be classic in terms or notoriety, but there are more of animated masterpieces, while it can be said about The Lion King that it's not only a masterpiece, but also a timeless classic.The Lion King is not an exhilarating adventure, nor a passionate romance, not a comic film, it's a wonderful coming-of-age story, focusing on the most universal values that guide our lives. On that level, the film is to Disney Renaissance what Bambi was to the Golden Age. And the comparison here is not fortuitous, The Lion King works almost as an adult drama whose most important theme is succession and passing of time, with the interesting notion that Simba, the central character, must conquer a lost title back. From the opening, we get the full meaning of the eternal cycle of time, with a rising sun announcing the birth of the new Prince, and all the animals of the savanna coming to pay respect to the King Mufasa's newborn son. The opening sequence of The Lion King with Elton John's Circle of Life is probably one of Disney greatest movie moments ever, and the proof, it it ever was needed, of that Disney capability to touch hearts and command our feelings with the simple magic use of motion and colors.This sequence and every following frame highlight the perfect mastery of every technical element  the animation, the dazzling cinematography with the perfect use of reliefs and colors to illustrate the diversity of a rich animal microcosm, the direction, the music, I mean both the score and the songs, the characters and probably more than anything, the story. It's about succession, family, life and death, jealousy and betrayal with the villain whose no one but the King's brother, Scar, whose suave voice from Jeremy Irons, provides a touch I would qualify as 'Shakespearian', a more sophisticated word for 'universal'. But forget these big words, because to understand why The Lion King is such an endearing classic, we have to regard it through the eyes of those who discovered the film as kids. In The Lion King, there's no romance, it's not about getting the girl, or the boy, the main character is a kid who wants to become like his father, who learns about the meaning of life, of courage and more than anything, of his identity, something sacred based on two pivotal elements  heritage and family, the past and the future, the very position in the circle of life. We can all relate to Simba as kids and as adults. And generally, the Disney stories that are centered on a kid are more appealing  Dumbo was about difference's acceptance, Pinocchio about responsibilities, The Fox and the Hound about tolerance, Jungle Book about &#x85; not that one was just pure fun &#x85; Romances rely on so many elements of predictability it easily undermines their appeal, and to recognize Disney romances, they're generally the ones where you most remember the scene-stealing sidekicks or comic relief characters.In The Lion King, Simba is the heart of the story, and we follow him during an epic journey in life, with his father and mentor, Mufasa, the King with that naturally authoritarian James Earl Jones' voice. Just thinking of the scene where they play at night gives me shudders, and I mean it  any boy close to his father can understand that level of tenderness and love &#x85; and of course, it makes the following sequence even more horrific, but this is what makes the film so memorable. Generations of kids have been traumatized by Bambi mom's death, why sparing ours? As usual, in Disney films, death, if not part of life, is part of a learning process, tragic but necessary. This is The Lion King, a wonderful story, populated by a gallery of (literally) colorful characters following an extraordinary soundtrack with so many unforgettable catchy songs, that lurched the film into pop culture memories  Hakuna Matata ! If there was ever a music associated with 1994, it would belong to The Lion King, and I'm glad it won an Oscar for this, as I'm glad Hans Zimmer won for the score too, as it probably is the musical expression of the film's emotional power. The conclusion of the film where Simba gets back on the top of the rock and starts roaring give me thrills (just thinking of it) and never fails to make me cry.There are no words to describe what makes The Lion King so great. It's like the Disney team decided to combine all the efforts for a last masterpiece ... that would become one of the greatest animated films ever.

The Lion King is the Disney Renaissance period at its pinnacle and probably the last hand-drawn Disney classic.Now, I won't mention Pixar and the 3D animated features again, because I want, for once, to take a big plunge and get back to that magical year that was 1994. Disney Renaissance was this unexpected animated streak that started with The Little Mermaid and brought up memorable masterpieces such as Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, which finally elevated the world of Animation to the same level of spectacular greatness and respectability than live-action films. But I think there are two words that get often mixed up  masterpieces and classics, a movie can be an excellent technical accomplishment but for some reasons, it gets less recognition than a minor film. I like Mermaid, the two B's and I'm a big fan of Aladdin, they might be classic in terms or notoriety, but there are more of animated masterpieces, while it can be said about The Lion King that it's not only a masterpiece, but also a timeless classic.The Lion King is not an exhilarating adventure, nor a passionate romance, not a comic film, it's a wonderful coming-of-age story, focusing on the most universal values that guide our lives. On that level, the film is to Disney Renaissance what Bambi was to the Golden Age. And the comparison here is not fortuitous, The Lion King works almost as an adult drama whose most important theme is succession and passing of time, with the interesting notion that Simba, the central character, must conquer a lost title back. From the opening, we get the full meaning of the eternal cycle of time, with a rising sun announcing the birth of the new Prince, and all the animals of the savanna coming to pay respect to the King Mufasa's newborn son. The opening sequence of The Lion King with Elton John's Circle of Life is probably one of Disney greatest movie moments ever, and the proof, it it ever was needed, of that Disney capability to touch hearts and command our feelings with the simple magic use of motion and colors.This sequence and every following frame highlight the perfect mastery of every technical element  the animation, the dazzling cinematography with the perfect use of reliefs and colors to illustrate the diversity of a rich animal microcosm, the direction, the music, I mean both the score and the songs, the characters and probably more than anything, the story. It's about succession, family, life and death, jealousy and betrayal with the villain whose no one but the King's brother, Scar, whose suave voice from Jeremy Irons, provides a touch I would qualify as 'Shakespearian', a more sophisticated word for 'universal'. But forget these big words, because to understand why The Lion King is such an endearing classic, we have to regard it through the eyes of those who discovered the film as kids.

While Yul Brynner is officially the star, none of the seven really outshines any other, nor does Eli Wallach as the leader of the bandits terrorizing the Mexican village. Each of the seven brings something neat to the group Vin (Steve McQueen) brings cool demeanor, Britt (James Coburn) brings laconic wile, O'Reilly (Charles Bronson) brings an interesting background, Lee (Robert Vaughn) brings tension, Chico (Horst Buchholz*) is a man in need of guidance, while Harry's (Brad Dexter) character isn't extensively developed.Whatever the case, John Sturges directed a really fine movie.

Federico Luppi is an antiques dealer who discovers an intricate, golden clockwork scarab hidden in a statue. When he engages the mechanism, it clings to his hand and injects something into his arm. After a while, he begins to feel younger and more virile. It turns out that the device grants life, perhaps immortality. And, of course, there are others who want it, notably another dying old antiques dealer (Claudio Brook), who enlists his brutish nephew (Ron Perlman) to retrieve the scarab from Luppi. The visuals are beautifully designed. Del Toro would get even better at that as his career advanced. His screenplay here is better than anything else he's directed. The acting is great, especially from Perlman, who is both menacing and very funny. My favorite performance in the film may be Tamara Shanath's as Luppi's silent granddaughter Aurora. She says all of one word, but she plays one of the most important roles in the film, and does a lot to wring the emotion out of Luppi's dilemma. Perhaps it's not the performance itself, but the casting, but whatever the cast, Shanath is perfect.

It's second to none, rivaled only by Back To The Future.It might have been another of my favorites, Terminator 2, that paved the way for CGI, but I'll still attribute the CGI movie-revolution to Jurassic Park. In my opinion Jurassic Park contains just the right amount of the right stuff The cast (right amount of primary actors and sidekicks), directing (Spielberg at his best) and the score (most of the soundtrack CD can be enjoyed without being accompanied by the movie, even if you don't like classical music!)Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Wayne Knight and Bob Peck all deliver outstanding performances and Samuel L. Jackson, Martin Ferrero, Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello hold their own. It's hard to select a favorite scene, but if I must, it'd have to be the scene where Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) and Lewis Dodgson (Cameron Thor) meet and Lewis says You shouldn't use my name to which Dennis responds Dodgson! Dodgson! We got Dodgson here!! See, nobody cares... )All in all, this movie just keeps you spellbound from start to finish!

It takes place only a little time after the first. Heather O'Rourke has gotten a little older since the first film, so you has many more lines in the film. I guess you could say it gives her character a little more personality. The father, mother and brother are the same from the first also, so that is good. A new edition is the mother of JoBeth Williams's character, Geraldine Fitzgerald. Now the biggest thing in this film is the character Kane played by Julian Beck. In the first film they gave the ghost a voice. Here they gave him a body and a really creepy on at that. Beck did an amazing job. The story line was decent but two things got in the way for me. They should of left the problem to Zelda Rubinstein's character. Instead they brought in this Indian guy and his acting was a little off. Also the ending of the film was interesting. Why they went with that ending, I am not sure. But still a great and scary movie.
