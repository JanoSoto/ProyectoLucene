[{"date":"20 July 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Steve Martin is a producer with what he considers a great script --Chubby Rain - in Bowfinger, a 1999 film also starring Eddie Murphy, Heather Graham, Terrence Stamp and Christine Baranski. Martin, who wrote the screenplay, is Bobby Bowfinger, a producer who is convinced that he has a hot sci fi property and wants Kit Ramsey (Murphy), a huge action star, to be his lead. (The script, by the way, sounds awful.) He has no way of getting to Kit, but he tries - and fails. Then he decides to make the film starring Kit anyway, except that Kit won't know it. He has a cast that has been on hold for months, and he rounds it out by holding auditions for $25 each (no checks). Here he finds his leading lady (Graham) and his - and everybody else in the cast and on the crew's - future girlfriend. His parking attendant friend can steal fancy cars for him, and he has another friend who can steal cameras and sound equipment. And he can get a top crew by going out in a van and picking up illegals trying to cross the border. He's set.Bobby tells his cast that Kit won't meet anyone and doesn't want to see the camera, and then stakes out Kit's house, finds out where he's having lunch, etc., and has his actors walking up to Kit and saying lines about aliens, screaming at him or chasing his car. Little do they know, Kit is a little paranoid when it comes to extraterrestrials. He's a member of a mind cult, run by Terrence Stamp, who keeps having him repeat that there are no aliens. As the filming continues and Kit is continually approached by aliens, Stamp sends him on an enforced vacation. That's when Bobby hires a Kit lookalike named Jiff (also Eddie Murphy).This is a preposterous story that's done well enough so that you can believe it could work, and it's a great premise. I may be a sap, but I found the end when everyone is watching the final film very touching. There are some hilarious moments and lots of satire from a very funny cast. Very enjoyable.

The whole thing goes spiraling downhill when their demo is destroyed, and while trying to escape, the boys come to realize that the radio station has become surrounded by the police. The Lone Rangers take the radio station and it's staff hostage with water guns that look like Uzis (filled with hot sauce) and with all their might try to get their demo to get some airplay as a crowd of soon-to-be fans gathers at the station to follow the mayhem.Now, the only reason I wanted to watch 'Airheads' in the first place was because I saw on the TV section of the newspapers that the wonderful Steve Buscemi would be starring in it. I was certainly not expecting it to be as funny as it turned out to be. I've never been a huge fan of Brendan Fraser and I still have a strong dislike for Adam Sandler, but this trio came together in 'Airheads' and created something so funny I laugh out loud whenever I think about some if it's moments, which does earn me the occasional glance in a public bus. Being a big fan of heavy metal myself, I was happily surprised to see White Zombie AND Lemmy himself in cameos, and the movie delivered some hilarious and original dialogue.As with every movie, it does have it's flaws; some of the jokes just don't deliver, and the character of the man hiding in the air ducts was, in my opinion, a bit too dramatic and silly. The big finale on the rooftop of the KPPX building was also a bit too weird for my taste.If you're looking for a simple and funny movie to rock your world, 'Airheads' is the one to go for!
