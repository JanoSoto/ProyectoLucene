The premise of the reality show is that the contestants are given weapons and have to murder each other in order to win. The contestants include a mentally insane man living in a trailer park, a cancer patient, a religious nurse, a high school teenager, a middle-aged father, and (the reigning champion) a pregnant woman. The film is structured as a marathon showing and is played as a series of episodes strung together each following these contestants. The film depicts these people as normal and everyday people who are forced into this terrible situation against their will, but the real meat of the film comes in when we get to learn about the histories of some of these characters. That's the point of the film where the film grows out of being a spoof of reality shows and begins to manifest into a social commentary. The high school teenager has parents who encourage her every step of the way and help her suit up for the murders that she is about to commit. The pregnant woman has been disowned by her own mother due to past incidents. The middle-aged parent has his own troubles at home. There's a lot more going on here than at first glance. This is an angry and dark satire that really challenges some of the concepts of reality and the satire of itself.There's a lot here that I truly admire. For starters, the performances. They are pretty awful in a way that, at times, seems cringe-worthy. However, when you take a look at reality television shows such as Survivor and The Real World, the acting in those is even worse. It's supposed to be reality, yet the people in them are not believable. That's what makes reality television such a joke, and so in a roundabout way of saying things the performances here are good because the actors are good at capturing the melodramatic mannerisms of the contestants at large. I particularly enjoyed the performance of Brooke Smith as the pregnant woman. She is ridiculously cold and cruel and monstrous, and you can really feel the bitterness that she feels. Yet her mannerisms are so sarcastic and almost pathetic. The same goes for the rest of the cast, but Smith has a visual presence to her that I've always admired. She's a terrific actress. Nobody can forget her performance as the kidnapped victim in The Silence of the Lambs. I've seen some of her television work as well and she almost always sticks out in a good way. Merritt Wever and Glenn Fitzgerald do an equally good job as the teenage girl and the cancer patient, the former being the most likable person in the cast and the latter having all of the best lines and being the most interesting of all the characters.My favorite thing about this film, however, has to be the momentum of it. Series 7 The Contenders is almost never boring and there's always something going on. It's virtually impossible to stop watching once you've started, even if you pick up in the middle of it. I think this was done intentionally. I think a lot of televisions shows have that same kind of watchability factor, and what I appreciated the most about this film is that there were no commercials that cut into the action. The satire of the film itself is simple and clever, but even if you put all that aside, you still have one hell of a captivating film. Putting the climax of the film aside, you do get to care about almost all these characters and you don't particularly want to see any of them die really.If you want my personal opinion on the film, I cannot say that I like it too much. I don't personally find the film itself to be very funny. I like dark humor, but I thought that this was too sick, really, to be funny. I also really don't like the ending. It felt like I was being beaten over the head by the satire. I also find that the film itself isn't exactly re-watchable. Once you know how it all ends, you really don't have any desire to ever really sit down and watch it. There are films out there that are sick and that you never really WANT to watch again, but at the same time you feel you should and can't help but feel the need to sit through it, but Series 7 The Contenders plays all of it's cards in one sitting and as a result you really don't feel any desire to absorb any of it. It's more the type of film that you just appreciate rather than like and enjoy. I can imagine a lot of horror fan and readers of Fangoria would love it to pieces or at least get a huge kick out of watching it. In my opinion, as brilliant and as clever as it is, I definitely wouldn't advise mainstream moviegoers to watch this. I thought it was a brilliantly directed film in a lot of ways, and the satire was effective, but I can't exactly recommend it. I'm glad I saw it though.

Then he schemes to free some children held prisoners in a far prison camp into Vietnam . As long as he's there , stubborn Braddock decides to head Thailand , being pursued by the former officer . The two-fisted Nam vet Colonel Braddock tries continuously to free the kids held captives and suffers various tortures in charge of the evil ruler . Braddock hunks his way through the jungle to save the waif children . He flees along with the kids and harassing his enemies pursuers , escaping the innumerable risks and dangers .From the beginning to the end the comic-book action-packed , transparent gore , and extreme violence is continued and it's fast movement ; for that reason the picture is pretty amusing though contains some perfunctory scenes . This is a routine actioner with Karate star Chuck Norris as the Vietnam veteran resulting to be one of the best roles he'd made to date , as he's fine as tough, cold , obstinate Colonel Braddock . It's a predictable, xenophobic , shallow and brainless film though will appeal to Chuck Norris enthusiasts because of it contains some excellent action sequences ( when Braddock shoots with his machine gun , several explosions or scenes of motorboat and helicopters ) . In the ink of ¨ Uncommon courage ¨( by Ted Kotcheff ) and ¨ RamboII ¨( George Pan Cosmatos ) with Norris attempting to imitate Silvester Stallone or Arnold Schwarnezzegger like one army man . The film is the best of the trilogy , the first entry deals with Braddock who schemes to free some American soldiers still held prisoners in a far prison camp into Vietnam . The second part ( directed by Lance Hool , the first's producer ) concerns about tortures and Braddock's suffering in prisoner camp . In the three movies there are some nasty , ominous villains well played by Asian players  James Hong , Soon Teck Oh, and Aki Aelong who bear offensive racial stereotypes . Appropriate musical score by Jay Chattaway and adequate cinematography by cameraman Joao Fernandez , both of whom worked in the trilogy . The motion picture is produced in average budget by Cannon films ( Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus ) and professionally directed by Aaron Norris , Chuck's brother . It's a movie for frantic action lovers and warlike genre buffs. Rating  Acceptable, passable and entertaining but violent . Although the movie has some aspects a little tough to take , this moving film still has its fine moments getting a bemusing atmosphere with agreeable results , furthermore grossed lot of money at the box office along with the previous entries .

And each time I become more baffled as to how anyone ever got the idea of esteeming him so highly. Admittedly, a SECOND remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers would have been a tough job for even a genuinely brilliant director to pull off successfully, given that both the original and the first remake were both excellent, subtle, complex movies in their own right. But Ferrara and his scriptwriter seem to ruin their own slim chances from the very outset - above all through the almost incomprehensibly dumb and clumsy decision to set this version on a military base, of all places. Both Siegel's original version and Kaufman's first remake had given themselves a chance to draw on that deepest source of terror - ambiguity - by setting their movies in environments that were innocuous and even comforting on the surface the generic American small town of the 1950s and the affluent libertarian paradise of 1970s San Francisco. What a crazy casting-away of this important resource to set the story in an army camp - an environment which is bristling with menace and alienation even when there is NO sinister alien force at work in it! The scenes with glassy-eyed soldiers in Ferrara's film understandably produce absolutely nothing of the unsettling effect of the scenes of glassy-eyed San Franciscan store-clerks and dentists in Kaufman's - for the simple reason that a soldier is MEANT to be glassy-eyed! Even on the micro-level, though, the script is a disaster - another cheap and shoddy piece of work from Nicholas St. John which really makes one wonder why Ferrara works so consistently with this hack. The voice-over given to Gabrielle Anwar is embarrassingly lacking in subtlety - If we had known what was going to happen, we would have run... - and appears to be intended to try to generate a tension that the action itself fails to generate. But scene after individual scene reeks of psychological implausibility and lazy writing. To choose just one example among many, take the little game of Never played by Anwar and the young soldier she is falling in love with. This truth-or-dare-type game is clearly a device to accellerate the process of the two characters' becoming intimate with one another. But the staging of the moments of discovery of the other's secrets is hopelessly artificial. We are asked to believe, for example, that the young girl played by Anwar would be shocked and moved to discover that the answer to the question Have you ever shot someone? is Yes - when it is put to a serving member of the US armed forces! This painfully artificial scene is pretty representative of the artificiality and uninspiredness of the whole film. As I say, another reason to ask what the hell does anyone SEE in Abel Ferrara?

A man discovers he isn't legally married and decides not to tell his wife. He'd rather be with her as if she were his mistress and have sex without the benefit of marriage. He finds the idea to be thrilling and exciting. Why he does isn't addressed. Perhaps the idea of defying society's conventions, or maybe the idea of gaining more power over his wife; a man can easily dump a mistress at any time; a wife, there's a long, messy divorce to deal with. Also, there's the sexual element behind it too; presumably sex with a mistress is more thrilling than sex with a wife.The wife finds out and dumps the husband for trying to turn her into that kind of woman. She dates his law partner, a true Southern gentleman who's entirely prim and proper and would never think of touching a woman before marriage. In the end, the wife finds their relationship unfulfilling, especially when he does not resort to violence to protect her honor. She dumps him and turns back to her hubby, a real man. It's interesting that the movie ends with the husband getting exactly what he wants, sex with his wife before marriage. In effect, despite his wife's long protest, he wins; he now takes her as his mistress. This is a sex comedy where the man entirely gets his way; his sex dream is realized.Questions this film asks does one really have to wait for marriage to have sex?

Others are fading to character status like Gene Raymond. He's almost unrecognizable in dyed black hair as the type of character Ralph Bellamy plays so well in films like The Awful Truth and His Girl Friday; it's a far cry from Raymond's leading man days of the early 1930s. Saddest of all is to see what happened to another leading lady of the late 20s, Betty Compson. A star from the great 1928 film The Docks of New York, she's truly unrecognizable here as the beat-up, low-class hag Gertie.Norman Krasna's script is serviceable, with a number of truly funny lines and scenes, mostly avoiding the sort of cliché-riddled, unfunny, idiotic cuteness that makes the 1943 film Princess O'Rourke so intolerable, a film for which Krasna inexplicably won the Academy Award for best screenplay.

All fine films, to be sure, and all deserving of the accolades bestowed upon them.But one film, curiously, often gets left off that list, and it's a shame, because for my money it leaves every single one of the pictures I mentioned above in the dust. I am referring to John Frankenheimer's brilliant, paranoid Cold War suspense thriller, THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.Describing this film is difficult. Not because of spoilers; the plot is such a labyrinth that I could lay it all out and it would not spoil a thing. It's hard to describe because it has to be experienced.Frank Sinatra, in one of his best performances, stars as Major Bennett Marco, a member of a platoon that was taken prisoner during the Korean conflict and subjected to some really scary brainwashing techniques. At the outset, Marco and some of his former buddies are having terrible nightmares about their experiences, and Marco is eventually affected by it enough that his commanding officer orders him to take sick leave. He decides to visit his former sergeant, an unlikeable man named Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), who is not suffering from nightmares but who reacts strangely when confronted by a deck of cards.One of the films strangest scenes takes place on the train to New York, where Shaw lives. Marco, so upset that his shaking fingers cannot light his cigarette, leaves the club car and stands in the vestibule. He is followed by a woman who was observing him. Her name is Eugenie Rose Chaney, played by Janet Leigh in one of her best performances. I will not reveal the dialogue that passes between them; suffice it to say that it is so strange as to be utterly incomprehensible, but these two end up falling in love.The other two major players in the piece are Raymond's stepfather, Johnny Iselin (James Gregory), a thinly-veiled Joseph McCarthy, and his overbearing wife Eleanor, played by Angela Lansbury. At first, Mrs Iselin simply seems to be an annoyance; she drags her husband around by the nose, irritates her son at every turn, and in general is a pain in the ass. It is not until much later that Lansbury shows her cards, as it were, and we are treated to the portrait of one of the most evil mothers ever put on the screen. Lansbury is brilliant; one of the most versatile performers of her day, she would only a couple of years later go from this dark character to being the toast of Broadway as the life- loving socialite Mame Dennis in the musical MAME. She was nominated for an Oscar for this role, but lost to Patty Duke for THE MIRACLE WORKER. A tough call; I think Duke's performance is equally amazing.I am not sure anyone born after the Berlin Wall came down will quite get the level of paranoid hysteria that drives the core of this film. I don't know what Jonathan Demme did with this story in his unnecessary remake, and I never shall, because I have no desire to see it. But if for nothing else than Lansbury's performance, this one demands to be seen. And like the best of Hitchcock's work, this one rewards multiple viewings. A true American classic.

Roy Dillon (John Cusack) is a small-time hustler who goes through his days scamming a few bucks here and a few bucks there off unsuspecting marks. Myra Langtree (Annette Bening) is Roy's deliberately disarmingly ditzy girlfriend. She's a different sort of grifter, one who doesn't rely on deceit but on her own sexuality. Lilly Dillon (Angelica Huston) is Roy's mother, who has seemingly run the course of the confidence game life and has ended up working for a mobbed up bookie named Bobo Justice (Pat Hingle), betting down the odds at racetracks and limiting Bobo's losses when gamblers get lucky on the right horse.Sent to the West Coast by her boss, Lilly drops in on the son she hasn't seen or spoken to in years and Roy finds himself caught between a mother who wants him off the grift and a girlfriend who wants Roy to join her in the world of big time, big league, big money con games she once knew. Myra used to be the sex appeal in a complicated scam that took rich Texas oil men for hundreds of thousands of dollars and wants to recreate all that with Roy. For himself, Roy just wants to be left alone to his small-time scams, even though he's grown somewhat sick and jaded with the business.The performances in this film are all quite good. Cusack and Huston create a believably damaged family where the bonds of affection are still there, just twisted into a Gordian Knot of anger, fear and desire. You can feel that Lilly knows her great days are behind her and she's accepted that, but wants her son to have more of a future. You can see Roy's exhaustion with the only life he's ever wanted, the life that defines his entire sense of self. A nd Myra is like a giggling shark, completely unconflicted about who she is and what she wants.

","genre":null},{"date":"6 September 2010","score":"","review":" I'm no expert, but I think The Grifters may be the only movie about con artists where the story isn't all about whether they can pull off the big con&#x85;and it's all the better for it.Instead, the story focuses on what sort of people want to make a living trying to cheat other people out of their money, what that life entails and how it ends. Roy Dillon (John Cusack) is a small-time hustler who goes through his days scamming a few bucks here and a few bucks there off unsuspecting marks. Myra Langtree (Annette Bening) is Roy's deliberately disarmingly ditzy girlfriend. She's a different sort of grifter, one who doesn't rely on deceit but on her own sexuality. Lilly Dillon (Angelica Huston) is Roy's mother, who has seemingly run the course of the confidence game life and has ended up working for a mobbed up bookie named Bobo Justice (Pat Hingle), betting down the odds at racetracks and limiting Bobo's losses when gamblers get lucky on the right horse.Sent to the West Coast by her boss, Lilly drops in on the son she hasn't seen or spoken to in years and Roy finds himself caught between a mother who wants him off the grift and a girlfriend who wants Roy to join her in the world of big time, big league, big money con games she once knew. Myra used to be the sex appeal in a complicated scam that took rich Texas oil men for hundreds of thousands of dollars and wants to recreate all that with Roy. For himself, Roy just wants to be left alone to his small-time scams, even though he's grown somewhat sick and jaded with the business.The performances in this film are all quite good. Cusack and Huston create a believably damaged family where the bonds of affection are still there, just twisted into a Gordian Knot of anger, fear and desire. You can feel that Lilly knows her great days are behind her and she's accepted that, but wants her son to have more of a future. You can see Roy's exhaustion with the only life he's ever wanted, the life that defines his entire sense of self. A nd Myra is like a giggling shark, completely unconflicted about who she is and what she wants.

Basically the Brody brothers, Michael 'Mike' (Dennis Quaid) and Sean (John Putch), sons of Amity Police Chief Brody, are working at seaside park Sea World with its aquarium based attractions, and run by Calvin Bouchard (An Officer and a Gentleman's Razzie nominated Louis Gossett Jr.). Sean meets Kelly Ann Bukowski (Back to the Future's Lea Thompson) and Michael's girlfriend Kathryn Morgan (Bess Armstrong) who work with the two dolphins Cindy and Sandy (Razzie winning Shrieking Dolphins), and do their parts to keep the place going. Soon enough Sea World, with its new underwater glass tunnels is endangered by a baby great white shark and decide to catch it to put on display, but it soon dies after not great treatment. They realise that the recent attacks in the open, caused by a shark, couldn't have been made by this baby, they are now on the lookout for the large mother that killed Shelby Overman (Harry Grant). It soon shows up and traps many visitors and the water park staff inside the leaking underwater dome, and the only way to kill the shark is to do the same as the previous film, electrocute him and have his jaws come towards us. Also starring Simon MacCorkindale as Philip FitzRoyce and Lock, Stock and Two Barrels' P.H. Moriarty as Jack Tate. Once again the shark, the rubber one nicknamed Bruce, doesn't scare you anymore, and even with the tell-tell signs that this film sued to be in 3D, like the shark crashing into the glass with shards coming towards you, it is just stupid. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Director for Joe Alves, Worst New Star for Worst Screenplay, Worst Picture and there was a Worst Career Achievement Award for Bruce the rubber shark from all three films.
