Consider that each frame implies the use of 24 images per second, and multiply this by the film's length, then think about all the parameters, like the perspectives that influence the size of the animated characters, the light and shadows for the choice of colors, the way the actors must pretend to physically interact with non-existent characters, grabbing them, shaking their heads or having their cheeks pinched by them &#x85; and all that stuff without the providential assistance of CGI, totally hand drawn from A to Z, in a total respect toward the same kind of dedication that conducted the hands of the ancient cartoon film-makers, the result is the ultimate proof that perfectionism always pays. There are Mary Poppins and Space Jam, but Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a class on its own and 'special' is too weak a word to define the effects, they are simply magical.I'm so glad I was a kid when I discovered it, I still remember how mesmerized I was by the introducing cartoon, something that resurrected the spirit of the Looney Tunes, Tom and Jerry, Walt Disney or Tex Avery's cartoons, this universe that vibrates a sensitive chord in everyone's hearts. If you're a kid you love it, if you're an adult, it awakens the inner kid who saw these cartoons on TV, and if you're even older, it will get you back to the good old days when you saw them on the movie theater. Roger Rabbit, even as an original goofy, bubbling, creation, is the living allegory of this Golden Age combining many characteristics from Bugs Bunny, Screwy Squirrel, Tom the car with a certain Disney-like innocence, and after having been burnt, electrocuted, blown, and hit by a fridge, the film introduces, through an unforgettable plot twist, the co-existence between toons and humans in the real world. And the transition to this universe seems so natural that the surprise ceases immediately when we start following the hero of the film, Bob Hoskins as Eddie Valiant.And the choice of Bob Hoskins to play the sourpuss, no-nonsense, private eye, is a stroke of genius, as he perfectly conveys the everyday feel of the noir genre hero with a hard-to-conceal wound in his heart. In that zany and crazy world when you can encounter a clumsy mail-pelican riding a bike, a baby with a 50-year old man lust, giggling weasels or a crazy octopus serving drinks in a bar, Eddie evolves with an unshakable seriousness, highlighting its ordinary aspect, which is a great gag by itself. We would all love to go to Toontown but Eddie doesn't and this reluctance leads to a rewarding sequence when he finally gets into the town for an extraordinary moment, where a serious man suddenly lives under the cartoon's Law of Physicals. If Bob Hoskins played his part in a cartoonish way, this part wouldn't have been as exhilarating. Eddie Valiant is the perfect straight man of the comedic duo formed with Roger Rabbit, two opposite characters who'd go as far as getting handcuffed together.The handcuff even contributes to the most hilarious moment, when Roger easily gets his hand off after the danger is over and justifies that he couldn't have done it earlier unless it was funny. And the timing he chose was perfect! Roger Rabbit's philosophy of life, defines the whole purpose of cartoons, it's all about laughing and smiling. No wonder that the Cartoons' Golden Age coincided with the Great Depression era and World War II, when people needed to laugh, and when laughs were the perfect weapon to handle the harshness of life. And if Roger Rabbit could get a wife like Jessica because he made her laugh, well, it says everything about humor's value. And Jessica Rabbit as the sensual and voluptuous creature, proves that there are no limits for seduction, and I wonder how many men would rather have a creature 'drawn that way' than a real woman in flesh and blood. And if not the best character, she certainly makes the most spectacular entrance when she emerges from that curtain.And the beauty of Who Framed Roger Rabbit is that the special effects always serve the purpose of the story. The film didn't forget to have a plot with its share of thrills, laughs, and even some dramatic moments you wouldn't expect. Honourable mention to Christopher Lloyd who proves again his unique talent to portray bizarre characters with an extreme convincingness, his portrayal of the sinister Judge Doom, makes him the perfect villain for such a creative film, hell, can you make a crueler villain than one who found a way to kill toons? and one of the most sadistic acts ever that would make my heart squeak of sadness.And the soul of the story is Eddie Valiant's reconquest of his lost sense of humor, a quest incarnated by one of the most immortal shots of the film, the last kiss between Eddie and Roger. And if I had to find an extra meaning to this kiss, it would be the expression of this profound love we have for these cartoons that enriched our childhood, and stood the test time, never losing their unique charm and universal appeal. And if only for having featured the two icons, Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse in the same frame, and the two greatest ducks in an unforgettable piano duet, the movie deserves the title of Best Picture of 1988.That's all, Folks!

Fox and Christopher Lloyd's improbably pairing as Marty McFly and Doc Emmett Brown, the cool 80's teenager and the mad scientist, yet the chemistry is here, and we believe that these guys can be great friends. There is this unforgettable sight of the De Lorean at 88 mph disintegrating in a flash of light, leaving the two unforgettable fire trails. There is this heart-pounding climax on the clock tower driven by Alan Silvestri exhilarating 80's-defining score. There is this heart in the story. As the pillar of the movie's greatness there is Bob Gale and Zemeckis' winner script.Back to the Future deserves its reputation as one of the most quotable films ever and with the richest gallery of colorful characters each one impacting our memories with so many delirious catchphrases, from Biff Tannen's Butthead to Marty's This is heavy and of course, Doc's hysterical 1,21 Gigawatts! or Great Scott. Christopher Lloyd has this unique talent to revive the mad scientist figure with a likable dimension, creating one of the most eccentric and sympathetic characters from the flamboyant 80's. But the power of the script doesn't just rely on its 'destiny' in one-liners, but in the way it rigorously respects the codes of every genre with a new remarkable technical precision.Back to the Future is a masterstroke of originality in the way it adapted the 'adventure' genre, where the exoticness of the setting doesn't rely on its geographical but chronological aspect. Marty lives in a weird world where people don't know what a Pepsi Free or who John Kennedy are, and where Ronald Reagan is still the actor?!. The adventure aspect provides some of the best gags of the film. Now to the Sci-Fi, from the simple premise of the film time travels, Zemeckis refreshed an old scientific speculation by introducing the notion of ripple effect, that the smallest change in the past can have significant consequences for the future, for the better or for the worse. Finally, a movie had the right approach to time travels, probably earning it a deserving place in AFI's Top 10 Sci-Fi films.This scientific approach conditioned Marty's mission in 1955, by preventing his parents from meeting and falling in love, Marty unknowingly jeopardized his own existence and of his siblings. The script outsmarts us through its ability to convert one thousands words into one simple image, Marty's picture with his brother and sister and the progressive fading of their bodies, cleverly illustrates Doc's notion of ripple effect. No need of words, the picture is the materialization of the success or the failure of the mission. And as long as Lorraine (Lea Thompson), is in love with her future son, the existence of her future children with George is severely compromised.What a tricky dilemma! And when you discover Marty's family in 1985, you wonder how such a loser as George McFly (Crispin Glover) could have had a woman anyways. And Marty made the thing impossible again by replacing his own father on his to-be mother's heart. And Lorraine, by falling in love with her own son, creates a whole oedipal situation that, beyond the laughs, offers a very interesting perspective on the perception we might have toward our parent's youth, as we finally realize that they were young once. Of course, no one would dare to question how he would react if his own mother fell in love with him, but the way this is handled in the film is tactful and never fall into caricature.This is the very aspect that makes Back to the Future a Family Comedy, with a heart beating for every generation, a film you can enjoy with your parents your buddies or your kids whether it's from the 50's or the 80's nostalgic value. Most of the film's humor relies on the 'generation gap' factor and the way things have changed a lot or not so much. Compare Lorraine's advice to her kids in 1985 and the way she behaved thirty year earlier. See poor Uncle Joey who might get used to his bars as a baby, Biff Tannen's same stupid jokes etc. The film cleverly underlines the effect time can have on our perceptions and relationships with people. But the beauty of Back to the Future is that the heart of the Family story and the entertainment from the laughs combined with the speculative imagination of Sci-Fi contribute to a new inspirational dimension.Time travels represent the final opportunity to domesticate time, and to get a second chance. George gets a second chance and Marty learns one lesson or two during his journey while applying the fatherly advice he gave to his own father. And even more powerful is the way George would ultimately be the one to win Lorraine's heart and not through Marty's intervention, proving that sometimes, a simple act of bravura can change all your life for the best. Similarly to It's a Wonderful Life, the film is about getting a second chance, about life, about time passing &#x85; And I can't go on without mentioning the most extraordinary moment of the film that would eternally ring bells of joy in my heart when George finally kisses Lorraine and in all of sudden, Marty who was progressively fading gets up and sees his brother and sister finally reappear in the photo. Mission accomplished! And two young people dancing, ignoring, but we do, that they'll be forever together. An extraordinary moment that for me, summarizes the cherished place this film will occupy in my heart, for a long ... time.

As the pillar of the movie's greatness there is Bob Gale and Zemeckis' winner script.Back to the Future deserves its reputation as one of the most quotable films ever and with the richest gallery of colorful characters each one impacting our memories with so many delirious catchphrases, from Biff Tannen's Butthead to Marty's This is heavy and of course, Doc's hysterical 1,21 Gigawatts! or Great Scott. Christopher Lloyd has this unique talent to revive the mad scientist figure with a likable dimension, creating one of the most eccentric and sympathetic characters from the flamboyant 80's. But the power of the script doesn't just rely on its 'destiny' in one-liners, but in the way it rigorously respects the codes of every genre with a new remarkable technical precision.Back to the Future is a masterstroke of originality in the way it adapted the 'adventure' genre, where the exoticness of the setting doesn't rely on its geographical but chronological aspect. Marty lives in a weird world where people don't know what a Pepsi Free or who John Kennedy are, and where Ronald Reagan is still the actor?!. The adventure aspect provides some of the best gags of the film. Now to the Sci-Fi, from the simple premise of the film time travels, Zemeckis refreshed an old scientific speculation by introducing the notion of ripple effect, that the smallest change in the past can have significant consequences for the future, for the better or for the worse. Finally, a movie had the right approach to time travels, probably earning it a deserving place in AFI's Top 10 Sci-Fi films.This scientific approach conditioned Marty's mission in 1955, by preventing his parents from meeting and falling in love, Marty unknowingly jeopardized his own existence and of his siblings. The script outsmarts us through its ability to convert one thousands words into one simple image, Marty's picture with his brother and sister and the progressive fading of their bodies, cleverly illustrates Doc's notion of ripple effect. No need of words, the picture is the materialization of the success or the failure of the mission. And as long as Lorraine (Lea Thompson), is in love with her future son, the existence of her future children with George is severely compromised.What a tricky dilemma! And when you discover Marty's family in 1985, you wonder how such a loser as George McFly (Crispin Glover) could have had a woman anyways. And Marty made the thing impossible again by replacing his own father on his to-be mother's heart. And Lorraine, by falling in love with her own son, creates a whole oedipal situation that, beyond the laughs, offers a very interesting perspective on the perception we might have toward our parent's youth, as we finally realize that they were young once. Of course, no one would dare to question how he would react if his own mother fell in love with him, but the way this is handled in the film is tactful and never fall into caricature.This is the very aspect that makes Back to the Future a Family Comedy, with a heart beating for every generation, a film you can enjoy with your parents your buddies or your kids whether it's from the 50's or the 80's nostalgic value. Most of the film's humor relies on the 'generation gap' factor and the way things have changed a lot or not so much. Compare Lorraine's advice to her kids in 1985 and the way she behaved thirty year earlier. See poor Uncle Joey who might get used to his bars as a baby, Biff Tannen's same stupid jokes etc. The film cleverly underlines the effect time can have on our perceptions and relationships with people. But the beauty of Back to the Future is that the heart of the Family story and the entertainment from the laughs combined with the speculative imagination of Sci-Fi contribute to a new inspirational dimension.Time travels represent the final opportunity to domesticate time, and to get a second chance. George gets a second chance and Marty learns one lesson or two during his journey while applying the fatherly advice he gave to his own father. And even more powerful is the way George would ultimately be the one to win Lorraine's heart and not through Marty's intervention, proving that sometimes, a simple act of bravura can change all your life for the best. Similarly to It's a Wonderful Life, the film is about getting a second chance, about life, about time passing &#x85; And I can't go on without mentioning the most extraordinary moment of the film that would eternally ring bells of joy in my heart when George finally kisses Lorraine and in all of sudden, Marty who was progressively fading gets up and sees his brother and sister finally reappear in the photo. Mission accomplished! And two young people dancing, ignoring, but we do, that they'll be forever together. An extraordinary moment that for me, summarizes the cherished place this film will occupy in my heart, for a long ... time.

I did; however, know how to pronounce the title. Funny story behind that, when I was young, I worked at a publishing company and had made a comment to one of the editors there on a framed play poster of this story he had on his wall. Being a very dainty and soft-spoken gentleman, his reaction to my mispronunciation of the title would have made any one laugh; including himself, but he corrected me and after that, I never did forget the French pronunciation of this title.. )Ever since, I was curious about the story, but as usual, even with classics; I'll sometimes intentionally put them off until later to watch, just for kicks. Sometimes; however, it's easier to appreciate some classics and certain types of books or film until you are a bit older. War and Peace is another novel I'm putting off reading for now. Eventually, I'll find the right time to read that one too.Oddly, I caught this on-demand from our cable company but the trailer somehow got switched with the 1995 version that starred Jean-Paul Belmondo. That movie looked very good as well, although judging from the trailer it must be adapted to a later time than that which the novel is set in.In any event, if you like Drama and have never had the pleasure of being entertained by this story, I would *highly recommend* it. It's certainly a tale of redemption and narrow-minded thinking at the same time. Shows both the side of humanity that we can be proud of, and a side of humanity that would be best left in the past or buried forever, mixed together in a masterful combination of drama.I will look forward to reading the novel as well. This is one of the few benefits from sometimes watching a movie prior to reading the book, I'm sure I will not be disappointed. I am also looking forward to watching other screen plays of this story, hopefully I can find the 1995 version without too much trouble.It may well deviate from the book some, so I can't comment there, but on it's own; it's one of the better dramas I've ever seen.

Soon after that Betty (Watts) encounters Rita, who now has amnesia, and the two set out to investigate Rita's identity and situation. Meanwhile, director Adam Kesher (Theroux) joins a meeting in which the humorless Castigliane brothers glower at him, point to a photo and say, this is the girl; and a hit man visits a friend in his office. Reasons arise to doubt the reality of some of the events we're seeing, plus we jump from one story line to another and watch them cross each other in a manner reminiscent of Pulp Fiction.I'm fairly certain that I mostly understand what really happened in the movie, although there's at least one scene (in and behind a diner) that I still don't quite get.

After a few too many years (in my view) attempting to win acclaim, this is Spielberg doing what he does better than just about anybody - creating pure cinematic entertainment which is visually stunning and emotional dynamite. He sets up the story with brilliant flourishes, like the opening killing of the park worker where all we see of the monster is a closeup of its eye, then moves on to show us the dinosaurs in a perfectly judged mixture of awe, wonder and terror. The eight minute sequence where the T-Rex attacks the children in the rainstorm is for my money the best monster scene in the whole of cinema, sustaining an incredible level of suspense throughout. The entire movie is filled with such brilliant scenes though - the juxtaposition of the kids on the electric fence with Ellie trying to turn the power back on, the hide-and-seek with the raptors in the kitchen. Even the quiet moments where Alan and the kids hide in the tree or when Hammond tells the melancholic story of his flea circus are all charged with emotion. The whole cast are excellent, with Neill and Dern great non-star leads and Goldblum stealing all the best lines (I'm always on the lookout for a future ex-Mrs Malcolm). Peck is terrific as the warden Muldoon, complete with big game hunter outfit and a memorable two-word final speech. There are some detractors who claim Michael Crichton's book is a retread of his earlier Westworld, substituting dinosaurs for robots, but this misses the point - the twin ideas of finding dinosaur DNA in mosquito blood and then housing the monsters in a theme park are spectacularly brilliant and original.

There is much to review; however, I will stick to the core principals which make this film so timeless. Most of the universally acclaimed works in cinema are usually recognized for their mastery of a certain cinematic feature. Very few films extend into the reaches of all-around perfection where no single element is embellished to anchor the film. Amadeus's perfection begins in script, which evolves complex psychological profiles of two antipodal characters Salieri and Mozart. The plot begins with what you think is a Cain and Abel archetype, but you soon find that the two composers are not at war with another. The real conflict lays in Salieri's mind, which is tormented by the level of genius that the impious Mozart possessed. Throughout the film, Salieri argues with his own conscience while blaming a god he claims to no longer believe in for his suffering.Aside from the brilliant writing, the production values of this film are all grade A the set design, the costume design, the cinematography, the sound editing and film score. The film was entirely shot with natural light which in my opinion makes this film the most aesthetically beautiful Hollywood film. The cast was entirely comprised of relatively unknown actors and actresses, who all gave performances above what most mainstream players would have at the time. Abraham's portrayal of Salieri ranks among the finest performances in any English-speaking role. Compare his acting as Young Salieri, depicted as a stern and polite gentleman to his acting as Old Salieri, who smiles with comical look of defeat. The polarization is drastic, yet it is the same character. Not to mention Hulce's awkwardly cunning work as Mozart.Forman's directing compulsively executes a delicate blend of over-the- top and subtle scenes, while thoroughly setting into place everything going on from the direction of the lead roles down to every single extra. Not one piece of this film was overlooked by Forman's attention to detail and realism. His work equates in cinema to that of which was done by the subject of the biopic in music.I don't think you have to have an intrigue in classical music or 18th Century Europe to enjoy this gem.

More closely resembling the novel it was based on Who Goes There? than the 1950s flick which only follows the first part of the story with the scientists finding the spacecraft, John Carpenter's remake made an icon out of the terrifying shape-shifting visitor.It's a typical monster run amok, but this time none of the characters know who's real and who's a thing because the organism is able to assimilate its victims and take on their likeness. When it attacks, it rips itself apart into a bloody blob of grotesque body parts. It really draws tension between the characters, which makes it especially interesting and the concept of not knowing who's who is pretty scary. Heck, the things are pretty scary, taking on ugly forms and making that wailing scream can send chills down one's spine.

The film is based on a true incident from the Civil War involving an espionage mission where several Union soldiers are sent under the leadership of a civilian who knows the territory. The idea is to seize a train and destroy as much railroad equipment and track between Marietta, Georgia and Chattanooga, Tennessee. The fact that Fess Parker as John J. Andrews is a civilian is cause for much dissension in the ranks of these soldiers who are not used to operating with stealth tactics. One of them, Jeff York, is obstreperous to the point of mutiny. Although Parker is the star, depending on your point of view the real hero is Jeffrey Hunter who is the conductor of the train Parker and his men steal. Hunter is courageous, cunning, and resourceful and every bit a match for Parker and his tricks. From back in the day I remember that the Disney Studio was marketing toy trains based on the locomotives used in this film. No amount of begging could get my parents to part with any money for one of those. But somewhere some folks around my age have those models and I daresay they're worth a fortune.The Great Locomotive Chase is a fine well constructed film that is as fresh today as when I saw it in theaters way back when.

Sam proposes a business with lands with him and invites Charles to have dinner with him at his farm. Charles learns that Sam is not accepted by the local society but he goes to the dinner party, where he meets Sam's wife Henrietta Flusky (Ingrid Bergman), an old acquaintance of his childhood in Ireland. Sooner Charles discovers that Henrietta is alcoholic and a totally unstable woman controlled by the housekeeper Milly (Margaret Leighton), and Sam was the groom of her family in Ireland. They had fallen in love with each other and Henrietta elopes with Sam. However, her brother hunts them and Sam kills him and is deported to Australia. Charles stays in Sam's farm to help Henrietta and sooner he falls in love with her. Meanwhile Sam is manipulated by Milly and his jealousy gets him into trouble and discloses dark secrets from his past with Henrietta.Under Capricorn is a melodramatic romance by Alfred Hitchcock set in Australia in 1831, in the period of colonization of this great nation by convicts from the United Kingdom.
