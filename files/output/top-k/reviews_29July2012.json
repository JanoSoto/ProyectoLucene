[{"date":"29 July 2012","score":"","review":" Before director Brad Bird hit the big time directing acclaimed Pixar films The Incredibles and Ratatouille, he directed a little animated film for Warner Brothers called The Iron Giant. It's a story set in the Red Scare era about a giant robot that crash lands on Earth. A young kid named Hogarth happens to find this robot and the two quickly develop a strong and powerful friendship. However, Hogarth must keep his giant friend safe as a snooping government worker named Kent tries to find out what Hogarth is hiding and whether or not it's dangerous (ie. built by the Russians). This is an incredibly moving, incredibly powerful film with a lot more to it than meets the eye.The Iron Giant starts out simple enough. It's a story we've seen before. A young boy befriends a larger than life person or thing, highlighting the innocent and non judgemental eye of a child. But this film makes this recognizable motif so powerful and so emotionally enthralling. It hits emotional chords that send chills up and down your body as the film roots itself into your heart. This is a shockingly poignant film with so much heart and a constant thread of sincerity running through it, despite it being a cartoon.This leads me to the other impressive thing about the film is the fact that it's a cartoon. You would expect it to be more in the league of some of the sillier and more light hearted Disney films like The Hunchback of Notre Dame or 101 Dalmations. Instead, The Iron Giant is much more complex and is more mature and intelligent than these films. And the cartoon element also makes it a visual spectacle that is simultaneously larger than life and down to Earth. This sincere parallelism makes the film entertaining and exciting as well as real as the story and characters connect on a very human level, even including and especially the Iron Giant himself, who proves to be more loving and more compassionate than most of the humans in this film. The emphatic realism of this film is enough to bring a tear to one's eye, and indeed it does.Don't underestimate The Iron Giant because of its simple cartoon exterior. It has a heart and a brain, and it has a surprising level of poignancy to it. This is a truly fantastic film that breaks new ground and proves just how human and just how emotionally superb a cartoon can be. This is a film that can't be missed, and must be experienced by anyone with a soul.

It's a very plausible extension of existing oppressive government\/social rule combined with technological advances in biogenetics. The world depicted is selecting men and women to do such tasks as space exploration on the basis of genetics. Their training and surroundings, while artistic in exterior effect, nonetheless are robotic. The chosen elite persons are under the thumb of authority, regimentation, genetic testing, and identification at all times. The situation of those that society says are genetically inferior is similar, but they are like the proles of 1984. They are consigned to menial tasks. Humanity is being suppressed. Mating has become a matter of genes, not heart. Aspirations are channeled by genetic capabilities, not dreams, will power and human determination. Human emotions exist but they are being hampered and dampened.Into this world comes a man who is genetically inferior to his brother and to the elite but who aspires to go into space travel. He is not hampered by his limits or fears, so that he even outlasts his superior brother in their racing contest. The human spirit triumphs.This is what makes Gattaca a beautiful story. It is that the human spirit comes through despite all, and begins to break the bonds of society's impositions that are being promoted by science and government. Even the murder of the director of the travel training facility is a sign of this rebellion, and there are other clear signs as well. But the story focuses on Ethan Hawke's personal struggle and challenges to pass himself off as a superior by using genetic material from someone willing to sell it to him who was in the elite before becoming crippled.The story takes a strong neo noir turn when the director's murder disrupts the usual routines and Hawke may be found out as Alan Arkin persists in ad hoc genetic roundups and tests.The story is simple yet powerful. It's easy to understand and beautiful. It's the story of a man wanting to be free to aspire and not be classified and pre-determined by genetic probabilities.The main thing I did not like about this film was the last few lines. These didn't fit the main themes at all, in my opinion. They actually make little sense in the context of the movie and work against the themes. These lines are They say every atom in our bodies was once a part of a star. Maybe I'm not leaving; maybe I'm going home. These lines are NOT about human spirit. They are materialistic. They are about the material universe, making it out to be some kind of home. They are viewing the human being as atoms. This is not spiritual at all. It is a denial of God as a person and the human being in his image. It is more in keeping with the ungodly roboticism and anti-humanity society that Hawke is leaving behind. I cannot fathom why the writer, who otherwise did an excellent job, chose to end the film with these lines.The performances I regarded as adequate and not much more. The story shone above the casting and the direction. ","genre":null},{"date":"29 July 2012","score":"","review":" Science fiction is defined by its plausibility, and this is genuine sci-fi.

Hayley Mill's 'Castaway' song is one of Disney's best musical moments and doesn't detract, we should always expect a song or two from Disney, but the songs Chevalier sings have got to be some of Disney's worst and most obnoxious tunes. not to mention that Maurice Chevalier's performance is so bad it's actually good in a we're-not-laughing-with-you-but-at-you way. i think his performance is even worse here than in the notorious 'Monkeys Go Home' movie. when Hayley mills is worried about the Patagonians fleeing from a flood of burning lava, Chevalier just throws his head back and chuckles, oo-la la! their plight is funny zo enjooooy it!. rather than amusing the statement just seems sadistic. it should happen to him. when Chevalier's character realizes he accidentally lead them to the wrong side of the world and laments, i am zoooooo stupid!, the viewer is inclined to agree. i've always felt that as a entertainer, Chevalier was specially challenged. i never was fond of 'GiGi'.does the movie offer up anything memorable or good? well, yes. as silly as it is, the film is pure Disney formula. it also has a knack for clever FX on a lower budget than '20,000 Leagues'. the film's FX range from obviously poor to excellent as in the Ombu tree and the trippy giant Condor scene. as for memorable, the film is so kooky that it's hard to forget (or forgive whichever the case).the film also has Hayley Mills as a asset. she pretty much rectifies whatever Chevalier kills off. Hayley Mills was a charming performer with a cosy sort of charisma. she can be all sweetness and cute adorability, but she does it with a natural grace and is never pretentious or forced.the film also benefits from good set design and a good understanding of history as well as good, sure handed direction from Disney stock director Robert Stevenson. Stevenson even manages to embellish the mostly pedestrian approach with some good cinematography as in a shot of the Indian's horses upsetting against a darkened sky before a flash flood.despite the numerous FX photography and matte shots, this hardly qualifies as classic, good cinema, but it is good Disney. i mean who else made movies like this except for Disney.i don't know what could have been done to make this a better movie. strangely enough i like it the way it is. it has a goofy charm to it and it is easily identifiable as a children's film.

Attention to detail in both his performance, make up, props, settings, and all aesthetic things are very high. He has a good voice for the role. True, Penelope Ann Miller is somewhat weak - but charming. Peter Boyle does a nice job with his small role. So does Tim Curry. John Lone over-does it as the villain of the piece. But the award for most wasted talent has to go to Ian McKellen who does virtually nothing except look befuddled. That is about all he does and gives a very strained performance doing virtually nothing. Nice to see Jonathan Winters in a film. He should have been in so many more - what a talent. But the star of this film is the film's artistic content - what you see on the screen. All that aforementioned artistry and detail. The special effects are rather good too. I was really impressed with the look of this film and the film in general. You might want to give The Shadow a try. After all - he knows what lurks in the hearts of men. Too bad he didn't take a closer look before they tried to sell this film to the audience of its time. ","genre":null},{"date":"29 July 2012","score":"","review":" And is that really very surprising?

Our super hero is a man who, more often than not, is hidden -Strike ONE!. He cavorts, waltzes, glides his way through what may be the 1920's or 1930's or even 40's - Strike TWO! That means we get old cars, old costumes, old CGI sets - older actors in most of the supporting roles. The script is intelligent, somewhat witty, somewhat campy - in other words you must be able to read and comprehend what you read to possibly have any appreciation for the film - Strike Three! The film is set in a Noir style - lots of suggestive action, use of lighting, shading, and other cinema techniques designed to heighten the atmosphere of the film and push the action through that atmosphere - Strike 4! I could go on, and before you think I think this is a great film, let me say it is a highly entertaining film, a film that is grossly under-appreciated more for the aforementioned things rather than its content. Director Russell Mulcahy and screenwriter Walter Gibson do it their way for the most part. Hence the lukewarm, poor reception. Their vision is a highly stylized retelling of the story of Lamont Cranston who is the Shadow. They provide some breathtaking visual artistry as well as a fairly faithful adaptation to the Shadow series without selling out by pandering to those less-inclined to appreciate the film for what it is.

The final shots of the film should have been left on the cutting room floor, and don't even get me started on Celine Dion. Blech.And yet, for all it's predictability, triteness and recurrent sickly-sweetness, Titanic works, and works well.Why? I can't really answer that question except to say that this particular love story, which spans an unbridgeable class divide and nearly nine decades, is, for all it's flaws, immensely satisfying. 17 year old Rose (Kate Winslet), of an aristocratic but recently impoverished Philadelphia society family, is heading home to America after taking in the Grand Tour of Europe with her fiancée, a Pennsylvania steel tycoon (Billy Zane). Trapped in a (soon to be) arranged marriage and deeply depressed, she attempts suicide by jumping off the bow of Titanic, but not before being talked out of such drastic action by a young drifter from third class named Jack Dawson (Leo Dicaprio, in the part which rocketed him to super stardom overnight). The story that follows is predictable, but never boring. It speaks to our deepest desires and most poignant longings. The love affair between Jack and Rose is the kind of love that, by it's very definition, cannot end happily, and at the same time you completely believe that the experience of those 48 hours with Jack have transformed Rose forever and for good. There's a fairy tale quality to the romance, sure. But what's wrong with that? The story of Jack and Rose is perfectly integrated into the dramatization of the most famous night of the 20th century, the last two hours in the life of the unsinkable R.M.S Titanic. A marvel of engineering in it's own time, and still so today, the White Star Line's Titanic (and her sisters Olympic and Brittanic) stood at the forefront of the technological revolution of the 20th century, well before humanity developed the means to annihilate itself with the atom bomb. Titanic and her sister ships belong to an era which imagined a world of endless, benign possibility, where Man might eradicate all nature's obstacles and reign supreme over the earth. Man would become, in short, a kind of God. And then came April 14th, 1912, and a meeting with destiny given form in an iceberg.James Cameron is fascinated by this night in the frigid North Atlantic, and it shows. The last hour and a half of the film is a close as we'll ever get to a time machine sent back a century to the horrific early morning hours that saw the leviathan plunge over two miles to the ocean floor, and 1502 souls expire in the subzero waters of the Atlantic ocean. While Jack and Rose are fictional, they allow Cameron to remind us, without delving into the historically correct trap that would have hindered him if he'd followed the story of one of the historical characters, to experience the desolation of those who survived, while those they loved froze and fell into the void below. The horrible beauty of that frigid, clear Atlantic night is vividly evoked. The most beautiful scenes in the film, in my opinion, are in the last 15 minutes, as Cameron allows his tragic story to play out in that eternally cold, unforgiving icy water (in reality a five foot deep swimming pool, but such is the effects budget that you'd never know), the stars blazing like torches in the sky. This is one of the few films that bring me to that place, where, no matter how hard I try, I can't help but tear up.

Firstly, it allows us to feel the pathos of this heartrending event, and it so doing, encourages empathy with all human tragedy. Secondly, it allows us to dream of experiencing whatever it is that Jack and Rose had for those brief 48 hours . Most of us will never know what that thing is like.

His was a unique way of looking at the world, so much so that he seemed to attract admirers and detractors in equal number. To love his work, however, is to have succumbed to an adagio tempo that allows us to meditate, as we watch,, on what is being revealed, be it character, history or legend. So strongly is the spirit of place conveyed that the viewer feels he is actually there in those wintry landscapes of northern Greece that Angelopoulos made very much his own.Possibly the single most important DVD issue in recent months has been Artificial Eye's release of all Angelopoulos's feature films in three boxed sets. This has enabled me to fall in love again with the few I previously knew such as Landscape in the Mist, The Beekeeper and Eternity and a Day and to discover other masterworks such as The Travelling Players and The Suspended Step of the Stork. If I concentrate this review on Eternity and a Day it is because it is the most recent I have re-experienced after a gap of several years. In many ways this study of a possibly terminally ill writer meditating on his life whilst at the same time struggling with his present, is the director's most personal film. Certainly it is his most immediate in the way it gets far nearer to its characters than usual, often viewing them in close-up rather than middle distance. The film commences with the boy Alexander responding, as he wakes one summer morning, to the summons of his friends to join them on the beach which faces his family home. Thereafter we only see him as an old man regardless of the time zone into which the film slips. Indeed it is the fluid use of time, often passing from present to past within a single shot, that is a salient and wonderfully satisfying feature of an Angelopoulos film. In his bleak present Alexander often thinks back to a day of perfect happiness, shortly after the birth of his daughter, with his late wife and family on the beach where he played as a child. There is little comfort in a present that prefigures the end. About to admit himself to hospital he visits his daughter hoping to leave his dog with her, only to find that his beloved house by the sea is about to be sold to developers. The big issues of history with which Angelopoulos is usually preoccupied are largely absent apart from the refugee problem resulting from the Balkan conflict. Alexander's accidental encounter with a young Albanian boy whom he rescues first from a police raid on a gang of unsolicited traffic window cleaners and later from child adoption racketeers provides the temporary solace of someone to care for during a period of almost unendurable loneliness. Like many brief and meaningful encounters this is short lived. The boy is about to board a ship for yet another clime. What to do to while away their last hour before departure? A nearby bus operating a circular city route provides an answer that fills the youngster's face with glee. It proves to be a magical ride taken by an assortment of characters, a querulous couple, a tired revolutionary from some demonstration bearing a cumbersome red flag, a trio of conservatoire musicians who perform more for themselves that for those around them and finally the poet from a previous century whom we have met earlier in the film searching for and buying words of an unfamiliar language. Who but Angelopoulos could have conjured up such an imaginative conceit! Moreover, those three cyclists clad in yellow heavy waterproofs who appear in other of his films (I read somewhere that they represent the Fates) take the same journey as the bus. Alexander is sad in the knowledge that he may be approaching death without finishing the book he is writing. Ironically Angelopoulos died before completing the final film of the trilogy he had been working on since Eternity and a Day. Tragic as this was, there is at least the consolation that he left behind him some of the most heartbreakingly beautiful films the cinema has given us.

It's brought to you by the same people, many of the same personality traits peep through the new performers, the budget is bigger, and the ending is the same.Holly Hunter, as someone said, is cute as a button -- and she's petite and sexy too, a lot more so than Mary Tyler Moore, who was raised in a nunnery. Would Mary Tyler Moore try to seduce a handsome stranger and, when that fails, rip off her pantyhose and fling them away in frustration. No. No, Mary Tyler Moore would not do that, whereas Holly Hunter would and does.The males that figure in the story are both attracted to Holly Hunter for obvious reasons. William Hurt is handsome, pleasant, but a bit vacuous. Albert Brooks is plain, neurotic, and brainy. Brooks has a hilarious scene. The threat of mass firings hangs in the air and he wants to anchor the news for the first time in years. As the moment approaches he turns into a neural shambles, and as he proceeds his carefully prepared clothing becomes soaked through with sweat. Is this normal?, he asks the crew, opening his jacket to show a shirt that suggests he just climbed out of a swimming pool.As in the TV show, the humor and the slight drama are based on interactional nuances. There's a brief but keenly perceived argument about whether a rebel should remove his boot if the TV crew prompt him to do so. There are a couple of cuss words -- this being a feature film and not a TV episode -- and Hurt cops a smooth feel of one of Hunter's appealing breasts, but there's nothing coarse about the humor, and the drama hints at disappointment, never at tragedy.It's a gentle story, but it's contrived too. It's impossible to believe that producer Holly Hunter, who has been in the business for years, will break off her budding relationship with William Hurt just because he faked a tear during an interview with a rape victim. Hell, any moron glued to the nightly news must assume that something like that goes on all the time.There are a few minor structural weaknesses. Near the beginning, when a tape is need at once for broadcast during the news, Joan Cusack grabs it and runs a long obstacle course to get it to the control room just in time for a staff member to whip it out of her hand and insert it into the slot so it plays immediately. Cusack is panting and almost collapses with relief but the audience hasn't been properly set up for the scene. It comes too early, before we have a chance to begin rooting for the team's success.That's carping though. It's an entertaining film. It ought to amuse everyone with its everyday familiarity and it should offend no one. That's entertainment, right? Just like the news.

Her father, the wealthy General McLaidlaw (Cedric Hardwicke), strongly disapproves but cannot stop the two embarking on a very expensive honeymoon, and buying an extravagant home. It is at this point that Johnnie admits he is completely broke, and has numerous gambling debts, and was hoping that Linda's inheritance will eventually sort out their problems. After Johnnie accepts a job working for his cousin, two of Linda's valuable family heirlooms go missing, and the lies and suspicious activities start to build up.Based on the 1932 novel Before the Fact by Frances Iles, Alfred Hitchcock's thriller is notable for the casting of heart-throb and screwball comedy regular Cary Grant as a possible homicidal maniac and compulsive con-man. The man with the longest arms in cinema gives one of his most memorable performances here, morphing himself into an irresponsible, childish and spoilt degenerate with apparent ease. Joan Fontaine won the Oscar for Best Actress (the only one for an actor working under Hitchcock), but Grant has remained strangely unrecognised, perhaps for the attitudes and behaviours of his character. There were stories of a studio fallout during the making of this film, with RKO concerned with the fact that Suspicion may ruin Cary Grant's heroic image, and this led to major changes having to be made from the book-to-screen adaptation, and this is the film's main problem. For such a great build-up, the climax and the big unravelling is just a big let- down, with the studio's influence as clear as day. It also slightly beggars belief how much Linda's character takes from her slimy husband, whether he is a potential murderer or not. She is truly an old-fashioned female character, standing by her husband no matter what, as boys will be boys regardless. As handsome and charming as Johnnie is, it is hard to take watching Linda forgive him almost instantly as he reveals he was hoping her vast future fortune will solve his own problems. Yet this is still a nicely played thriller, with Hitchcock's usual big set-pieces making way for something much more low-key. It has the same kind of money-focused, pulpy feel that the Coen brother's have come to perfect in the last twenty years or so, and would not seem out of place in a Southern Gothic setting. Like most Hitchcock films, Suspicion is effortlessly watchable, but it is a shame that Hitchcock was still yet to become the colossal figure in cinema that would have seen him have complete artistic control over the film, and would have no doubt led to a much more satisfying experience. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"29 July 2012","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Cocky and handsome playboy Johnnie Aysgarth (Cary Grant) romances the timid Linda (Joan Fontaine) and eventually convinces her to marry him.

The deeper mystery is whether or not Douglas will eventually overcome her or vice versa.Who will win in the future? Who wins so far? It's a bit of a draw, but Douglas has the edge. Does detective Michael Douglas win so far, or does murderess Sharon Stone win? Douglas tells us point blank that although he loves Stone, that will not stop him from nailing her. He is as manipulative of her as she is of him. He is partially using that sex with her in order to get her to attempt to murder him. But she too is clever and smart, and she waits for the chance to overpower him if and when he lets down his guard with her while having sex or elsewhere. Douglas is trying to trap her, we also know, because he doesn't show a trace of jealousy when she flaunts her female lovers. Further depiction of the motive of Douglas is that he firmly restrains his emotions even when she manipulates him into killing police psychologist Beth (Jeanne Tripplehorn). And even more do we learn his intent because he doesn't reveal his cards even after she brutally kills his friend and fellow-detective George Dzundza.Douglas has rather violent sex with Beth in one scene, and we may take that as indication of what he is capable of and what potential and excitement he is bringing to the bedroom with Stone, and she goes for it. In fact, throughout the entire movie, it is rare for Douglas to lose his composure, and when he does, it's usually his temper, and then briefly. He has a great deal of self-control. He tells us several times that he will play this game. Stone likes such games. She tells us that she doesn't play by the rules. Dzundza warns Douglas off against such a dangerous game. His character stands in marked contrast to that of Douglas, who is far more prone to taking a big risk to get his quarry.The story is like The Most Dangerous Game with Douglas and Stone stalking each other. There is no resolution after two hours to this mystery Who will win? Stone shows her acting bona fides throughout, and Douglas has never been better. The movie does get a little long, but that's a minor issue. The theme by Jerry Goldsmith and other music adds quite a lot of mystery. There is a motif of cubism used in the titles and in paintings. This symbolizes characters being refracted. There are a couple of chase scenes that seem out of place or a little too much. Again, these are not a major failing.There are several quick events at an early stage that place suspicion on Beth, so that the alert viewer may begin to suspect her even before Douglas does. There is also a somewhat misleading comment from Stone's lover, Roxy, who tells Douglas that Stone didn't kill the rock star (the initial murder at the opening). This can be taken as a natural defense by her loyal and jealous lover, and as a device to cast suspicion on Roxy in order to maintain the suspense. However, we are made well aware that Stone is the killer by her demeanor and behavior when she is interrogated, and by her having written a book depicting the murder. Her motive is to see if she can break society's rules and get away with it. Every development as the movie proceeds adds to the conviction that Stone is the guilty one. Douglas knows this. He is only thrown off the track and then only briefly when Stone uses her previous relationship with Beth as a means of throwing suspicion on Beth.So basically we have a character study of two strong people in conflict.

Peck is good, as is Simmons and Heston, but it is generally agreed that Burl Ives steels the show. No spoilers in my review, just trust that you will enjoy this film. I wish they still made em like this today!

It is not long in the movie before you realize that playing with the mind of a human is the ultimate goal of the movie. The movie starts out with a man who appears to be dark and cold killing someone on a boat. Then this mysterious man sets the boat to a blaze leaving two survivors. The two survivors include Kevin Spacey who plays Roger Verbal and a Hungarian. The twist and turns begin once FBI agent Giancarlo Esposito who plays Jack Baer and U.S Customs agent Chazz Palminteri who plays Dave Kujan , show up to interview Verbal who just so happens to be a con artist. The theme of manipulation is present throughout the film. Here you have a master manipulator con artist that has taken pride in manipulating someone. The theme of The Usual Suspects is very similar to Primal Fear starring Richard Gere. Primal Fear is about a boy who convinces the jury and his attorney that he suffers from multiple personality disorder and the evil side of his disorder murdered someone. Verbal whose character appears to be a vulnerable man dealing with cerebral palsy tells a story with one goal in mind and that is to manipulate. He begins to tell this story of five criminals, Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro) and Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak). Who were brought in by the police to be questioned about a crime. Verbal convinces these individuals to pull of a robbery which leads to more than robbery.As Verbal tells the story he has flashbacks of the robberies. He explains how the five criminals became involved with an evil man by the name of Keyser Soze. The five criminals were to smuggle 91 million worth of cocaine from the boat. This cocaine was to be sold to Soze rival. Kujan seems to be intrigued by the story Verbal is telling and he believes every word of it. Kujan, is so involved with this story he encourages Verbal to tell more. Verbal tells of a story that explains Keyser Soze character. He goes on to mention how the Hungarian rivals broke into the home of Keyser and rapped his wife and murdered his son but to their surprise Keyser Soze kills his family and the invaders as he could not stand to live with himself after that event. This particular scene in the movie the lighting and color was enhanced so that you would believe in this evil character described by Verbal. The home was full of colors that are typically seen in Spanish homes. But the colors also helped to enhance the evil in the room. The music helped to intensify the anger of Keyser Soze.Verbal is enjoying every minute of the manipulation. Verbal goes on to tell how they planned to take the drugs. The criminals planned to take out the crew on deck which was the sellers and the buyers. Keaton, McManus and Hokney attack the sellers and the buyers which they manage to kill most of them. Once the thieves load the ship they find no drugs on board. Hokney, Keaton, and McManus are murdered by a mysterious assailant leaving only Verbal and a severely burned Hungarian. Verbal a cerebral palsy man sitting in this cluttered office looking pathetic and incapable of bursting a grape has managed to convince Kujan that he is victim throughout this ordeal and Keaton was the mastermind behind the robberies and the boat heist. Keaton was still alive and had faked his death. Keaton has to be Keyser Soze this evil drug dealer who you dared crossed. Twist, turns, and ultimate manipulation was the theme throughout this entire movie even up to the end of the movie. The director managed to take all elements of the movie and tie back to a jaw dropping ending. The movie will reveal how clever Verbal is at taking his surroundings and convincing others of this elaborate story that tells of crime, murder, deception and manipulation. The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist (Singer, 1995). This movie is one that you can continue to watch as it will almost for certain turn up something you missed the first time around. The actors selected for this movie was perfect for each character. I would recommend this movie. ","genre":null},{"date":"29 July 2012","score":"","review":" The Usual Suspects (1995) is a movie based on twist, turns and most importantly manipulation.

Once he has delivered the goods he asks store owner Barbara Waggoman if there is anything he can take back to Laramie so he isn't just taking wagons; she says that there is plenty of salt that he could take from the local salt pan so long as he keeps his eyes open for Apaches. It turns out it isn't the Apaches he needed to worry about; he is attacked by Barbara's cousin Dave; a hothead who doesn't want anybody on their land even if they are just taking salt. He destroys Lockhart's wagons and kills several of his mules. Paying off his men Lockhart stays in Coronado... he doesn't just want restitution for the wagons and mules; he has a far more personal reason to be there; his brother was one of the cavalry men killed and he is intent on finding out just who sold repeating rifles to the Apaches. Before he can find out who is responsible he will get caught in a long running feud between the Waggomans and rival rancher Kate Canady and have more than one further run in with Dave.This is a great western; largely due to the central performance from James Stewart as Lockhart; while his character is softly spoken and always polite there is always the sense that if pushed he will fight back hard. Other notable performances come from Arthur Kennedy who played Waggoman's foreman Vic Hansbro; Barbara's fiancé and the man Alec Waggoman trusts to keep his wayward son under control and Donald Crisp who plays Alec; a severe man who knows that his son isn't fit to inherit the business but loves him despite his faults. There isn't a huge amount of action but what there is is tense and in some cases quite shocking. There is a nice twist towards the end but I won't spoil it by giving any details. Filmed on location in New Mexico the scenery looked great and made a nice change from the Southern California scenery that seems to double for anywhere in America in some westerns!
