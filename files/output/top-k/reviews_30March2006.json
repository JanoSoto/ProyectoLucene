It is arguably the greatest war film as well. George C. Scott plays Patton brilliantly a man with a fascinating personality and a fascinating history. The most beautiful thing about this film is that it can be interpreted several ways, despite the fact that it is not an abstract film. One can appreciate Patton for what he is a brilliant strategist and tactician, a true leader, a man for getting the job done. However, the film also shows the darker side of his pride and showmanship, qualities that may have gotten men killed for the sake of his place in the history books. These two qualities have layers of interplay, referencing each other and giving insight into the other, which alone is a serious feat for any film. Beyond even these relatively shallow aspects, which are already far greater than most films, there are levels of sophistication and insight here beyond what most people are capable of seeing. This film manages to ask questions that most films could never even dream of asking, all at the same time. What relationship do individual personalities have to the course of history? Is the enemy of my enemy always my friend? Do the ends justify the means? What is the relationship between leadership and democracy? Is preemptive military action justified, and under what circumstances? What is the relationship between diplomacy and war? Is war a glorious endeavour? Is war a part of human nature? How has war changed throughout history, and how do societal changes and changes in outlook affect the conduct and outcome of a war? I could write a book on these questions alone. On my last viewing, I was struck particularly by the fact that it often takes a brilliant warrior to end a war, and that we as humans too often see right and wrong based upon whose side we are on. This film brilliantly portrays a man whose time had passed, and yet who found himself perfectly aligned with the times. A warrior in the true sense, Patton took pride in being part of the bloodiest war ever; he is an anachronism, and yet perfectly placed in the modern world. This is a film for the thinker and the philosopher, and it offers new insight into classic problems of human nature and society upon each viewing. I never say this, because it is almost never true, but anyone who cannot appreciate this film is not a very insightful or thoughtful person. There is something for everyone here, except the person who refuses to accept or even ponder the lessons of the past; someone who refuses to analyze themselves and the way they fit into the world. This film is so complex and layered that it makes the Godfather look simplistic; no easy task. I might also mention that this film includes brilliant cinematography, groundbreaking war footage, a great soundtrack, and some of the best acting I've ever seen. Highly recommended.

Nothing, from the opening title sequence, to the characters, to even the paper-thin story, was worth redeeming or recognizable as value. Several reviews have argued the point that perhaps director Scott Silver (of The Mod Squad fame) should have done a bit of research on the life of a male prostitute instead of just allowing David Arquette the freedom of just jumping around and screaming to show the hardships of reality. I couldn't agree more. I felt cheated and confused as I watched this elongated 24-hour period erupt chaotically into several convoluted themes and unsecured elements. There was never a moment in this film to feel for our characters. There was never a moment in this film for us, the audience members, to feel what living on the streets of LA involved. There was never a moment in this film for us to see the pain that Arquette or Haas experienced on a daily basis. Why was there never a moment? There was never this moment because Silver was too busy using cliché elements to force us to like Arquette as a character. Silver continually forced Arquette's empathy and tribulations onto us thinking that seeing a Hollywood actor playing a gruff street urchin would immediately force us to break into tears and bow at the mercy of this flawed character. How pathetic.What should have unfolded during the course of this film was a chance for us to see the underbelly that LA attempts to hide. There should have been more hardships aimed toward Arquette that would have developed into sympathetic moments. A tragic character allows audience members to connect freely, while a forced character, like the one seen in Johns, makes us fall asleep, feel apathetic, and overly pressured. It nearly seemed that during the course of this film Arquette could have run for Mayor of the homeless if he would have pushed himself a bit further. Arquette's final version of his character reminded me of an annoying politician instead of a homeless person. He was shaking hands with everyone, becoming a stronger part of the street's culture, whether the street wanted it or not. Never was it apparent that he was upset with his current living situation. It was never made apparent that he wanted to escape the life that he had created. So, when the unstructured ending finally occurred, it boggled my mind. Arquette, or maybe it was Silver, made his character do things that I believe he would not have done in real life. John (Arquette's character) would have not fallen asleep as shown in the beginning of the film once he had his birthday money in hand. John would not have easily thrown his dream into the trash, as stated, but instead worked throughout the film to make it a reality.Silver's inclusion of Donner (Lucas Haas) into the script only brought the story further into the dismal zone. Donner is a random target. Silver makes Donner stronger than John and I do not think that is a fair assessment. Whatever Donner wants, he gets, no matter how that hurts John. Donner is not the good friend that we all assume throughout the course of the film. In fact, I believe that we could have done without this friend and just watched the course of John in this one day period. Donner takes John's heart, his dreams, and nearly places him in trouble, and we are to assume that Donner was about to save him from this disappointing life? I didn't buy it. Secondly, did anyone else have trouble with the fact that Arquette and Haas were the two worst male prostitutes ever filmed? Not that I have any experience with male prostitutes, but it felt as if each time either of these two professionals got into cars with clients, they had quite a no mentality. This led to my impression that these two characters were not just weak, mismatched, and underdriven, but also lazy. Silver successfully created two of the laziest male prostitutes to ever grace the silver screen. I guess we cannot knock him for completely failing in this film.Finally, I would like to say that Silver had a boatload of opportunity with this film. The talent (perhaps outside of Arquette) was present on the screen, sadly, they just didn't do anything. Keith David, Nicky Katt, Terrance Howard, Elliot Gould, and even John C. McGinley kept this film watchable, but with the counterpoints leading back to Arquette it only worsened the overall feeling of the film. Even these independent heavy-hitters couldn't save this little ditty of a production. We needed emotion and heartache instead of the suppressed anger we felt when dealing with the stereotypical generalization of these characters. Silver didn't create an original body of work, but instead took cliché moments from other cinematic features and called them his own. Throw in a spaz-tastic lead, and you have what I like to call a little film named Johns.This was not worth the DVD it was printed on. I normally don't mind general independent films being made to tell a story about the hardships of living in America, but what I do mind is when they cast decent actors and give them horrible parts, or surround them in a horrible story, or just do not allow them to blossom. Arquette hurt this film by not fully embracing the character or the realism of the life that follows these certain individuals. Lukas Haas completely embodied this film with his character. Poorly developed and randomly tangent. This was a poor film and I do not recommend it to even the novice of cinema fanatics.Grade * out of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"30 March 2006","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This was a sorry, pathetic excuse of a film.

Nowadays, when people think of Rambo at all, a M60-toting teeth-baring, Commie killing tank comes to mind. This only comes to pass in the last two Rambo films, which were either mediocre (Rambo II) or poor (Rambo III). First Blood, however, surprised me greatly. I expected this film to kick off the modern Rambo legacy which lives on in the minds of many teenagers' today. Instead, I got a film which was more about survival than about pure action. A lot of the time, we see Rambo prowl through the jungle in a game of cat-and-mouse, being stalking and stalked by a few unwitting cops. We observe Rambo's incredible resourcefulness, as he uses all things available to him to create ingenious booby traps for his enemies while subsisting on things that would make a billy goat puke. (He even uses a paper sack as a shirt!)Anyway, now on to why John Rambo is prowling through the jungle. He does not prowl through there because he wants to - no my friend, the 'system' is out to get him. (Where have I heard this excuse before?) You see, Rambo is a war hero of the highest order. After walking into a small town, the local sheriff, who seems to have X-ray vision, kicks Rambo out again. After walking back, Rambo is arrested for vagrancy. This is a ridiculous plot hole, as you cannot arrest anyone for being a 'suspected' vagrant, particularly if you have not seen the guy before. The plot mostly consists of hide-and-seek games between Rambo and said Sheriff; other than an interesting twist at the end, there is not much to it. I also do not understand why you would aggressively pursue someone for an offence as minor as vagrancy.However, the hide-and-seek games are enthralling to watch, due to the eerie music score which always seems to resonate in the background. I knew what would happen at the end, due to my prior experience with Rambo II, but the uninitiated will not guess what will happen until Rambo's commanding officer, Col. Samuel Trautman, arrives on the scene, 'to save the cops from Rambo'. At this point, First Blood has already firmly established itself as a survival movie, but up to this point, there has not been a lot of action. This quickly changes, as Rambo, who is by now 'on the edge', goes into town and blows a couple of buildings up real good. He also does everything possible to damage the town, including shooting up the police station. In the police station, his mission comes to an end...one way or another.One of First Blood's main failings is it's construction of the main character, John Rambo, who, on first glance, is seen to be terrorising a few cops. Rambo appears to be little more than an uncultured thug, which is why I did not like this film the first time I saw it. I could not for the life of me understand why Rambo was attacking a few decent cops who were merely following orders from a fanatical, obsessive Sheriff. Another failing is it's dodgy moral stance that people who served in the Vietnam War are all schizophrenics and psychos and as such should be hunted down. The construction of Rambo could more or less be put down to the performance of the lead actor, Sylvester Stallone. Let's face it, when he plays anyone who has a deeper personality than that of a heroic muscle-man, he usually sucks. Thankfully, he utters precious few lines until the end, when he goes into a rant about Vietnam. The rant has absolutely no effect due to his lack of coherence. Luckily, he is backed up well by Richard Crenna, who plays Trautman with remarkable assurance, along with Bill Dennehy, who attacks the role of the local Sheriff with aggression, as he should, given that the Sheriff is an authoritarian character.Anyway, I have said enough. First Blood is a good action and survival film which has largely been forgotten, due to the omnipresent insanity of the two films which followed it. It is not what I would call excellent it's plot and moral stance are both dubious and this is quite telling. It is still, however, above average and better than many action movies going around today. If possible, make sure you see it before seeing the other two, otherwise it loses some of its sting.3.5\/5 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"30 March 2006","score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" First Blood is a good, albeit largely forgotten, action and survival film.

We observe Rambo's incredible resourcefulness, as he uses all things available to him to create ingenious booby traps for his enemies while subsisting on things that would make a billy goat puke. (He even uses a paper sack as a shirt!)Anyway, now on to why John Rambo is prowling through the jungle. He does not prowl through there because he wants to - no my friend, the 'system' is out to get him. (Where have I heard this excuse before?) You see, Rambo is a war hero of the highest order. After walking into a small town, the local sheriff, who seems to have X-ray vision, kicks Rambo out again. After walking back, Rambo is arrested for vagrancy. This is a ridiculous plot hole, as you cannot arrest anyone for being a 'suspected' vagrant, particularly if you have not seen the guy before. The plot mostly consists of hide-and-seek games between Rambo and said Sheriff; other than an interesting twist at the end, there is not much to it. I also do not understand why you would aggressively pursue someone for an offence as minor as vagrancy.However, the hide-and-seek games are enthralling to watch, due to the eerie music score which always seems to resonate in the background. I knew what would happen at the end, due to my prior experience with Rambo II, but the uninitiated will not guess what will happen until Rambo's commanding officer, Col. Samuel Trautman, arrives on the scene, 'to save the cops from Rambo'. At this point, First Blood has already firmly established itself as a survival movie, but up to this point, there has not been a lot of action. This quickly changes, as Rambo, who is by now 'on the edge', goes into town and blows a couple of buildings up real good. He also does everything possible to damage the town, including shooting up the police station. In the police station, his mission comes to an end...one way or another.One of First Blood's main failings is it's construction of the main character, John Rambo, who, on first glance, is seen to be terrorising a few cops. Rambo appears to be little more than an uncultured thug, which is why I did not like this film the first time I saw it. I could not for the life of me understand why Rambo was attacking a few decent cops who were merely following orders from a fanatical, obsessive Sheriff. Another failing is it's dodgy moral stance that people who served in the Vietnam War are all schizophrenics and psychos and as such should be hunted down. The construction of Rambo could more or less be put down to the performance of the lead actor, Sylvester Stallone. Let's face it, when he plays anyone who has a deeper personality than that of a heroic muscle-man, he usually sucks. Thankfully, he utters precious few lines until the end, when he goes into a rant about Vietnam. The rant has absolutely no effect due to his lack of coherence. Luckily, he is backed up well by Richard Crenna, who plays Trautman with remarkable assurance, along with Bill Dennehy, who attacks the role of the local Sheriff with aggression, as he should, given that the Sheriff is an authoritarian character.Anyway, I have said enough. First Blood is a good action and survival film which has largely been forgotten, due to the omnipresent insanity of the two films which followed it. It is not what I would call excellent it's plot and moral stance are both dubious and this is quite telling. It is still, however, above average and better than many action movies going around today. If possible, make sure you see it before seeing the other two, otherwise it loses some of its sting.3.5\/5 stars ","genre":"Action, Adventure"},{"date":"30 March 2006","score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" First Blood is a good, albeit largely forgotten, action and survival film.

When her friends Roland Kincaid, (Ken Sagoes) and Joey Crusel, (Rodney Eastman) are killed, Alice thinks it's Freddy Kruegar, (Robert Englund) and informs the group about his legend. When her friends start dying in rapid succession, Alice comes to term with the fact that she alone can stop Freddy's rampage.The Good News As one of the better entries in the series, this one features some great stuff. One of the new things is suspense. Normally, these films are used to having the situation the characters are trapped in drive the horror. In here, the horror also comes with the jumps in the film. Quite often, Freddy jumps into view behind someone or transforms from a person we don't expect him to. It's quite scary at times, even with all the dream sequences. Those were undoubtedly the highlights, as each one was a joy to watch. It really is hard to pick just one as a favorite, as they all have something different to offer, and that is quite rare in a film like this, but a true classic is the one which features death by fire sequence. It features a lot of ingenious special effects, a great gory death, and several suspense scenes that make it a great scene. All the other dream sequences are great, and they really are great to watch. Also worthy of mention is the opening sequence, which features a healthy amount of suspense and an overall fantastic sequence that brings Freddy back into the action. Also, strangely, the jokes in here worked for me. Most don't like the film because the humor started taking over from this point in the series, in here they come out funny.The Bad News It really didn't bother me with the amount of humor in this one, but it almost completely supersedes the horror in the series. It's a complaint that some have against the film, and I can see how it can happen. There are a lot more jokes in here, mainly due to Freddy's increased screen-time compared to the original sequels. Also, it's got a pretty standard issue plot for a sequel. It's pretty much the exact same as the first one, only with new actors and dream sequences.

One of the new things is suspense. Normally, these films are used to having the situation the characters are trapped in drive the horror. In here, the horror also comes with the jumps in the film. Quite often, Freddy jumps into view behind someone or transforms from a person we don't expect him to. It's quite scary at times, even with all the dream sequences. Those were undoubtedly the highlights, as each one was a joy to watch. It really is hard to pick just one as a favorite, as they all have something different to offer, and that is quite rare in a film like this, but a true classic is the one which features death by fire sequence. It features a lot of ingenious special effects, a great gory death, and several suspense scenes that make it a great scene. All the other dream sequences are great, and they really are great to watch. Also worthy of mention is the opening sequence, which features a healthy amount of suspense and an overall fantastic sequence that brings Freddy back into the action.

It's a complaint that some have against the film, and I can see how it can happen. There are a lot more jokes in here, mainly due to Freddy's increased screen-time compared to the original sequels.

There are also the mediocre, abounding and forgettable.Then there are the films so ridiculous, so contrived, so terribly self-important that it forgets its purpose in the first place, that it forever marks our memories no matter how badly we may wish to forget it. This film just may be the crown jewel of that entire lot.Everyone knows the story. Two star-crossed lovers who despite their passion can not seem to overcome the chains from the family feud that should divide them, and by weaving a web of lies and secrecy end up destroying themselves with it. It remains more or less unchanged in the movie, aside from needed adaptations to suit the new time period, but it simply does not work. The play itself is rather contrived. To expect an audience to see people in modern day falling into the same pitfalls as their Elizabethan counterparts did is insulting to their intelligence. The director and writer does not go to any lengths to attempt to make it seem possible either.Characterizaton is also changed, but whether it was really the writing at fault remains to be seen. The lines are almost always taken directly from the play, but atrocious acting could easily have twisted it. It certainly exists in large amounts. By far and large, the cast is horrible, with extremely overrated and miscast Dicaprio and Danes at the helm. Both resort to overblown and soap operatic acting to convey the emotional turmoil of their characters, and neither do it well enough to merit anything but a laugh.The film is nothing if not imaginative, however. The cinematography is gorgeous, and many shots whimsical, lavish, and inspired choices on the director's part. However, this distracts from the dark, morbid tone of the story, and rather than complement it, it only makes the film lose impact during the important scenes. The director also uses gratuitous shots of Christ and crosses and wide shots to emphasize drama, but only manages to come across as full of himself in a Neon Genesis Evangelion-esquire move.The Breakdown Cheesy, over-dramatic, with terrible acting to boot.

All stories aside of his behind-the-scenes efforts to MAKE Eraserhead, it was this film that brought him international recognition, and remains well worth the time to re\/visit. The first time I experienced it, I hated my friend who brought me (with no advance warning except that it was amazing). What I saw on the screen frightened me at the deepest levels of my being, and I didn't know why. As the years and viewings pass (both in the theater, and on video or DVD), I lose none of my emotional response, but gain further intellectual and formal appreciation for the artfulness of it, and lots of thoughts about the meaning. Lynch himself will NOT discuss Eraserhead's meaning, and perhaps wisely so. None the less, I believe he sees it in somewhat surreal terms (clarification being left to the individual), but was guided by the deep seated fears, confusions, and attractions that fill the Freudian world of the child, and which continue into adulthood. Most of his films since have been eerie and unsettling, but based more in realities we can recognize in the waking, every day sense. Here, the photography is gorgeous and mysterious, the SOUNDscape is perhaps the most subliminally powerful of all time, the dialog perfectly uncomfortable, and the situations right at the edge of possible.

All the characters are fantastic, and the story is really excellent, plus Kurt Russell, William Baldwin and Robert De Niro are all simply amazing in this!. It really is quite a powerful film in my opinion, as I didn't find it cheesy at all, and the ending while excellent is extremely sad, plus Russell and William Baldwin had wonderful chemistry together. Donald Sutherland has a really creepy role in this, and while it has a couple predictable moments, it surprisingly was able to keep me guessing for the most part, plus it's extremely well made and pretty well written as well. The Fire effects really blew me away(especially in the finale), and The opening is also quite sad, plus you are able to care for the two brothers (Russell and Baldwin), because you can tell they have had some problems with each other, and have gone through rough times.One of my favorite funny moments in this film is when Baldwin (Brian) and Jennifer Jason Leigh (Jen) are making out at the top of the fire truck, and then the fire team squad have to go stop a fire, as I thought that was quite amusing, and there is lots of suspense as well, plus I think this should be a lot higher then 6.6 in my opinion. Some scenes were incredibly tense, and if you wanted to be a fireman someday, then you most definitely should see this movie, plus I thought it was cool how Russell played 2 roles as the dad(in the opening) and the brother Stephen!. I was actually really surprised how good the story was, as I as expecting a cheesy B type one, and it has one of the finest casts ever, plus I wish they gave De Niro more screen time because he had an awesome character. I would go as far to say that this is a minor classic, and the person who was committing those fire's may not be as easy to guess as you think, as I didn't expect it to be that person at all, plus it had a very good score as well. This is a fantastic fire fighting film, that's really moving, and emotional, with brilliant effects, and outstanding performances, and I say go see it now!.The Direction is fantastic!. Ron Howard does a fantastic! job here, with brilliant camera work, incredible angles, adding some good atmosphere, and did lots of other awesome shots as well, plus he kept the film at an extremely fast pace.The Acting is outstanding!. Kurt Russell is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, funny, had wonderful chemistry with William Baldwin, had an awesome character, and I felt for him in a lot of scenes, he also had some awesome emotional scenes with Baldwin, as usual brought a lot of charisma, and did a lot of courageous stuff, I adored his performance! (Russell Rules!!!!!!!). William Baldwin is also amazing here as Russell's younger brother Brain, he was extremely likable, vulnerable, and had a haunted past, as you will be rooting for him, he is the only Baldwin I like out of the bunch, as I was really surprised by how amazing he was here!. Robert De Niro is also amazing as always and is amazing here, he had a rough&gruff character but was a nice guy actually, he brought his usual intensity, and had a great character, I just wish they gave him more screen time cause he is one of the best ever, he also had some great scenes with Baldwin (De Niro Rules!!!!!!!). Donald Sutherland is really creepy in his role, and he was able to pull it off perfectly as it was a somewhat difficult role I Imagine, he was awesome. Jennifer Jason Leigh is beautiful and does what she has to do very well, which unfortunately wasn't much, I wish they gave her more screen time. Scott Glenn is great as Axe, he was intense, I quite liked him, he was especially good near the end. Rebecca De Mornay is beautiful, and does fine in her role, and had some good scenes with Russell, however not enough screen time. Jason Gedrick is very good as the rookie Tim I liked him. J.T.

Robert De Niro is also amazing as always and is amazing here, he had a rough&gruff character but was a nice guy actually, he brought his usual intensity, and had a great character, I just wish they gave him more screen time cause he is one of the best ever, he also had some great scenes with Baldwin (De Niro Rules!!!!!!!). Donald Sutherland is really creepy in his role, and he was able to pull it off perfectly as it was a somewhat difficult role I Imagine, he was awesome. Jennifer Jason Leigh is beautiful and does what she has to do very well, which unfortunately wasn't much, I wish they gave her more screen time. Scott Glenn is great as Axe, he was intense, I quite liked him, he was especially good near the end. Rebecca De Mornay is beautiful, and does fine in her role, and had some good scenes with Russell, however not enough screen time. Jason Gedrick is very good as the rookie Tim I liked him. J.T. Walsh is excellent as the sleaze ball Mayor I hated him. Rest of the cast are fine.Overall go see it now!. ***** out of 5 ","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"30 March 2006","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Okay, so far Boris Karloff played the monster in the first three Frankenstein films.

If you watch carefully, you may finally figure out, very near the end of the picture, that Wood's plot hinges on this solar bomb threat that the aliens are worried mankind will develop. It's really a mystery up until this late point in the story; flying saucers are sighted all over, the military keeps it hush-hush, no one knows what these aliens want, the saucers fly too low and tend to force people to fall over, and, for some very odd reason, resurrecting three of the characters in the story into walking zombies is a major goal of the aliens. As I watched this all the way through, for perhaps the first time, I wondered how all these plot points would come together - what is the missing piece of the puzzle Ed Wood will put in place by the end? Of course, it didn't all fall into place by the end but I sort of breathed a sigh of relief when the alien (Manlove in a deliriously bad performance) finally revealed his concerns about Solaranite ('What? There's no such thing!'). And it happens during perhaps the most well-known & best scene in the movie the alien is insulting and excitable in this story, unable to hide his contempt for Earthlings ('Stupid! Stupid!'), receiving a backhand blow from the stalwart hero (Walcott), who is obviously very patriotic about such things.So, with all this mystery & tension described above, how can I give this movie just one star? I am sorry, my friend, but this is what it is - a case study of how not to put a film together. I should know - in my twenties, I was in a similar situation to Wood. I had some super-8 footage shot during my late teens which I didn't know what to do with. I finally grouped together some friends and shot some more footage to align, as best I could, with the older stuff. All because I did my best doesn't mean the result was good. No, it was quite bad. As bad as Wood's 'masterpiece' of ineptness? Probably worse, but I had a smaller crew than him. One of the weaknesses of Plan 9... (and there are too many to mention here) is that it's a patchwork. Most of us know, for example, that Lugosi's footage was shot earlier and had nothing to do with the story of Plan 9... Was Wood clever in how he, er, spliced it in? We may applaud his resourcefulness, but that does not a good movie make. Wood's use of stock footage - not too shabby. But, stock footage is rarely a criteria for good films, except perhaps for documentaries. Interesting how I'm going on about this movie for such a lengthy comment, isn't it? The spell of Ed Wood is there, no doubt. No doubt.It boils down to the fact (yes, these ARE the shocking facts) that every single scene has something wrong with it. I'm not exaggerating - every scene! In fact, in some scenes, every single shot has something wrong with it. If it's not the background, it's something in the senseless dialogue. The most professional scene is probably with Talbot, his one scene as a general, but its very static - a 2-person dialogue-driven scene in a room. Champions of this picture claim that it's rarely boring, perhaps the most important element to judge a film by; my friend, this is not the case - quite a few scenes, like the one just mentioned, drag on and on. So I could not, in good conscience, give this more than a single star. Why has this become so popular - a cult favorite? To some extent, judging films is a subjective process; check out the votes for this on IMDb the majority gave it one star; but the 2nd highest number of people gave it 10 stars! (Do we detect stuffing a ballot box?). Many viewers, especially aspiring filmmakers and film students, find this movie very instructional. Others find the exercise of finding the aforementioned wrong things in every scene to be quite amusing. I have to admit, I was sick when I watched this last night (or was it some dream?) and it still made me chuckle in a few spots.

Billy Wilder was a fantastic director, making movies that at the time were so much more intelligent and sophisticated than their peers, so I think he simply stumbled when making this overly-simplified message movie.To be sure, Wilder does bring some creative vision to this story of a raging alcoholic struggling through his addictive demons for one long weekend. He uses the cinematic equivalent of first-person narrative to get you into Ray Milland's mind, and tries to make the audience feel what it's like when alcohol is the focus of your world. Thus, at a performance of La Traviata, instead of filming the stage as it might appear to the audience watching the opera, Wilder cuts from shots of Milland's face to close-ups of the fake drinks the actors are holding as they perform. At other times, he even shoots scenes from the perspective of the alcohol, so when Milland tries to hide his booze from himself, we'll get shots of him storming around the room from the vantage point of the hidden bottles. But Milland gives a histrionic performance in the lead role, as cartoonish in its own way as Nicolas Cage's was in Leaving Las Vegas, playing another hopeless alcoholic, and he undermines any effort at seriousness on Wilder's part. The alcohol itself is nearly personified to the point of caricature; I half expected to see a bottle of gin stand up and twirl its silent-film villain mustache while giving a dastardly laugh. And to top everything off, Milland delivers a ridiculous inspirational speech at the film's end, a call-to-arms for other silent alcoholics to emerge and begin overcoming their disease. After a whole movie in which alcoholism is depicted as a form of demonic possession, the ending makes it seem that the decision to quit drinking is as easy as changing from 2% milk to skim.Still, this film should be commended for admitting that alcoholism IS a disease, and that it's not simply a lack of will power or self control that causes people to abuse. I can't think of a film before this one that really treated alcoholism seriously, or even addressed it at all. Think of all those 30s comedies (The Thin Man comes to mind) where hardly a scene goes by without the leading man holding a martini, or where the stumbling drunk is a stock character included for his comic potential.So The Lost Weekend is a film that I can't whole-heartedly pan, because I do feel that points should be rewarded for trying to use cinema as a communication device for addressing social concerns, but if you know an alcoholic, I doubt you'll be able to do anything but laugh at the silly version of alcoholism you'll see here.
