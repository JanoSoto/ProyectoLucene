He's pretty good in dramas and comedies, he can sing and dance greatly. He makes his character believable and charming.The only thing I dislike of this movie is Shannyn Shossamon's character Jocelyn (please no offense or anything just my opinion).

The fight choreography was great and I did enjoy many of the fight scenes, though I am growing rather tired of the over-exaggerated environments in which they tend to take place. For instance, a fight scene amidst a room full of ladders served only to show how good with navigating a tenuous arrangement of ladders that the characters can be. It did nothing to display an actual fight, to showcase the talent of what are supposedly the two greatest fighters in the movie's universe.Mena Suvari was little better than robotic and the filming was simply terrible. The shots and quality of film reminded me of some of the worse examples of made-for-tv movies out there. Obviously historical accuracy wasn't in the best interests of the filmmakers either as several scenes showed Explosive shell cannons. A technology that didn't come along in Europe for another few hundred years.To cap it all off. There was one of the biggest editing mistakes I've ever seen in my life. If anyone still wants to see this movie after this review then keep your eyes peeled near the end when D'Artagnan is about to storm the castle. He is wearing a brown duster of sorts and then his friends come to help and all of a sudden he is wearing a blue Musketeers uniform. Next shot he is wearing the brown duster again and someone throws him the blue Musketeers uniform that he was wearing only moments before. WHAT THE HELL?How did that ever make it past editing? Past screening even?Oh well, if the people who made the film had quality in mind in the first place then the movie would have actually been decent if not good.My advice is not to go see this movie.

In both movies, you have some impressively done, eye-popping (especially to American audiences) fight choreography, and a filmmaker who has no idea how to shoot these scenes correctly.  I couldn't see Jackie Chan fighting in Rush Hour (I haven't bothered with its sequel), and whereas I got the distinct sense that something cool was happening in the early fight scenes in The Musketeer, director (and cinematographer) Peter Hyams didn't bother to let me get a good look at it.The climactic fight scene on the ladders in some damned impressive work.  I cheered, I crawled up in my seat, and then it didn't end, it just sort of... stopped.  I won't fault anyone for that; what WAS there was incredible to watch, and these guys were on a budget.Unfortunately, this is reflected in earlier scenes, too-- early in the film, the fight scenes (choreographed by a name new to American audiences, Xin Xin Xiong) look like Hyams shot them twice once from across the room, once in close-ups.  The result is a blended mess that lets me hear swords clanging, and lets me look at... a blur!The action is all going on out of frame.  Rush Hour director Brett Ratner is a hack music video director and we expect this from him.  Mr. Hyams has been doing this for nearly 30 years and whether this is his first martial arts film or not, I'd think the man would have some clue as to how to show off his choreographer's work.  But for whatever reason, he fell flat. Though we should have known this when he started doing Jean-Claude Van Damme movies.The script isn't bad.  Tiny scraps of character are thrown to D'Artagnan (Justin Chambers) and Febre (Tim Roth), and the Queen gets to have a grand old time as well.  The talking scenes are shot and directed quite well, the funny lines are funny, etc.For the action sequences, Hyams is at a loss, because by the time we get to the last one or two, which are quite good, we've already felt betrayed by the earlier ones, and have become bored.  In fact, this is set up during the opening credits, when we see each actor and their name, before we even meet their character hence, we haven't met these characters yet, so therefore we don't care to see them in the opening credits.  Yawn.  There's a reason better filmmakers put those at the END of the film, Pete.I put this one up there with the Jet Li vehicle Black Mask.  Some good lines, and action worth checking out, but this was not what we traditionally refer to as a good movie.  It was martial arts filler, while we wait for the Wachowski Brothers, or Ang Lee, or someone with that level of talent to make sure the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

I got the movie on DVD two days ago and I hardly couldn't wait to watch it, because I had already read quite a few comments, mostly negative one's, on it over the past few months. At first I was kind of disappointed. I was not the kind of movie I had expected. I was hoping to see a movie as great as `Heat' or `Ronin'. But one cannot compare these three movies. They are completely different. So I let my first impressions rest for a while and watched the movie the next day a second time. 15 Minutes is not as bad a movie after all. It has its good parts, though I would prefer some things to be different.The movie clearly shows how greedy and immoral the media can be if it comes to win ratings and get some money, even though it appears to be overdone in some parts. `Bad news is good news!' That is how it has always been and that is how it will always be, as long as there is an audience. Who would watch a news channel with only good news? People want sensation, even though they don't want to admit it. But there is certainly a limit to what the media should broadcast. In this movie the media exceeds this limit by far. Furthermore the film quite well points out the problem with the insanity plea. Some critics say the film glorifies violence, which is not right. The two bad guys in this movie are so ugly and their crimes are so heinous, one cannot but loathe their deeds. I also want to mention how well chosen the cast is. Robert DeNiro is, as always, brilliant is his role. His performance is definitely the highlight in this movie. The action scenes are very well done too.What I didn't like is the way the story goes in some parts. For example how the two criminals get access to Eddy's (Robert DeNiro) apartment. A famous detective just doesn't make a stupid mistake like this. Then the bad guy Oleg with the digital camcorder acts just way too silly, which lets him appear rather unrealistic to me. Even though he is meant to be crazy, his stupid behavior goes way too far. His character can not be taken seriously. Edward Burns as the arson investigator also has to act a little too unprofessional at times, which doesn't add anything positive to his character's credibility. All this gives the whole story an unrealistic touch from time to time, which is very sad. In general I don't like a movie to be cut down just to get it to an 2-hour length. Most of the time I prefer to have the deleted scenes put back in again, but this movie is really better off without them. The final scene has an interesting twist, but the coincidence with Nicolette is just too farfetched. Oleg's final appearance looks ridiculous and doesn't fit into the whole tragic, unless it were supposed to be a comedy.  It is a tense thriller, with some suspense, though only two scenes really kept me on the edge of my seat. I also missed scenes introducing some more the characters played by Robert DeNiro and Edward Burns.Nevertheless I rank it a 7 out of 10.

People want sensation, even though they don't want to admit it. But there is certainly a limit to what the media should broadcast. In this movie the media exceeds this limit by far. Furthermore the film quite well points out the problem with the insanity plea. Some critics say the film glorifies violence, which is not right. The two bad guys in this movie are so ugly and their crimes are so heinous, one cannot but loathe their deeds. I also want to mention how well chosen the cast is. Robert DeNiro is, as always, brilliant is his role. His performance is definitely the highlight in this movie. The action scenes are very well done too.What I didn't like is the way the story goes in some parts. For example how the two criminals get access to Eddy's (Robert DeNiro) apartment. A famous detective just doesn't make a stupid mistake like this. Then the bad guy Oleg with the digital camcorder acts just way too silly, which lets him appear rather unrealistic to me. Even though he is meant to be crazy, his stupid behavior goes way too far. His character can not be taken seriously. Edward Burns as the arson investigator also has to act a little too unprofessional at times, which doesn't add anything positive to his character's credibility. All this gives the whole story an unrealistic touch from time to time, which is very sad. In general I don't like a movie to be cut down just to get it to an 2-hour length. Most of the time I prefer to have the deleted scenes put back in again, but this movie is really better off without them. The final scene has an interesting twist, but the coincidence with Nicolette is just too farfetched. Oleg's final appearance looks ridiculous and doesn't fit into the whole tragic, unless it were supposed to be a comedy.  It is a tense thriller, with some suspense, though only two scenes really kept me on the edge of my seat. I also missed scenes introducing some more the characters played by Robert DeNiro and Edward Burns.Nevertheless I rank it a 7 out of 10.

The actors portraying French characters spoke with a collection of accents, including French, English and American.

It is very spectacular, but it is nothing more than that...First of all, this movie has from the classic novel of Alexandre Dumas only the characters name and the basic synopsis... Which is the young Gascon who wanted to be a Musketeer like is father have been before. As you may presume, the way to succeed is full of enemies and obstacles.Second, some of the original characters have been deleted (like Milady) or completely transformed (like Cardinal de Richelieu who almost help young D'Artagnan)In conclusion, do not go see this movie if you want to find it exactly like the novel, you will be very disappointed.

Extremely entertaining, very witty and super-cool. This film is an excellent example of a independent film that wasn't huge at the box office, it wasn't very well noticed but it was surprisingly good. It is always fun to discover a film that you know nothing about, you make no expectations and it turns out to be so amusing. Swingers is indeed, that kind of a flick! The script is great, and very hip. The movie is packed with funny and cool dialogues. l laughed through the whole film, sometimes just because I loved the conversations so much. The main characters are very well written. The acting is good.Specially  Vince Voyer, he was fantastic. His character, Trent. A smooth talking player, who knows all the tricks of the hustling trade, was the peek of the movie. I enjoyed that guy so much, I could sit and listen to him talk for hours. The film is written by Jon Favreu, who also played the main character, Mike. He was very believable as a guy trying to get over his long-time girlfriend. Mike and Trent made an excellent duo.The look of the film was kind of amature, which made it pretty cool. I am really looking forward to seeing more of Jon´s work in the future. He seems to be very promising as a writer. The score 8\/10.
