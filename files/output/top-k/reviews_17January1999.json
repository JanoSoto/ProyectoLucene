The film was well-done (though the Godfather-like climax was not as well done as Coppola) and well-cast, but it seemed somewhat unfocused to me at times. The 27 year old main character conveys a great presence, as do Geoffrey Rush and Joseph Fiennes.  Unfortunately, we did not get to see enough of Elizabeth and her advisors in the war room preparing to plot strategy, and I'm convinced that had I not taught this age many times, I would have been thoroughly lost.  An A for effort, but definitely an E for editing.

However, after having read the book myself, I kept wanting the movie to go into more detail.  I wanted to see the characters progress, see them change, but that would have doubled the length of the film.I can see how viewers who have not read the book could become lost, it took me a while to figure out which face belonged to each character.  Knowing the details of the book helped to keep my interest throughout the film, I found myself constantly comparing the way I had envisioned James Jones' novel to the way Terrance Malick portrayed the events.The colors and images of the film were a pleasure to watch.  I pictured a much darker setting reading the novel, while the film is often bright and colorful.The casting was great in some areas, strange in others.  The main problems I saw in the casting were apparent cameos by some big Hollywood names. I did hear that many of those roles were much larger in the screenplay, but cropped in the final product.  I honestly never saw either Bill Pullman or Mickey Rourke.Making this film was a huge undertaking and I am glad Malick did.  I would steer anyone expecting a mainstream movie far clear of the film. I suggest reading the novel first, and then again after as well.
