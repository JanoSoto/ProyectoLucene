I argued long and hard that AP was one of the best comedies to come out of the 1990s, and I hoped that AP2 would be superior. The early word on the film was that it was enjoyable and even funnier than the first incarnation.  The early word was wrong.  Instead of a real caricature of the swinging sixties, we are subjected to a long series of bad jokes that don't know when to quit.  Austin is wholly ridiculous, and any conflict that might exist between Felicity and Austin, Dr. Evil and Austin, Fat Bastard and Austin, or really any one character and another is ultimately irrelevant.  The knowing look at the audience before Austin goes back in time as Basil and he discuss the confusion of time travel is almost a knowing joke on the audience  Yeah, so what if it's asinine... but we talk about poop!  Har-har... the genius, the wit, and the humanity in the original are lost.  Myers takes the good sequences from the original and ruins them, blundering blindly as he breaks continuity like it's going out of fashion as quickly as the rocket sight gag.  The Austin in this film is completely unlike the Austin we came to care for in the first film. Austin is callous, uncaring, and unsophisticated.  The cool outside that was used to hide an inner nervous boy in the first film is lost (compare the scene with Alotta versus the scene with Ivana)... Austin has no respect, no concern, and no idea of how uncool he has become in the hands of his deluded creator.  The extended music videos might have been nice cut scenes for the DVD, but they really had no place in the film.  One gets the feeling that one is watching a big budget SNL skit, complete with guest appearances and funnies that aren't, just like SNL.  The movie ends up being a film that elicits only a few chuckles and an empty feeling at the end...  The whole story was for naught, because Austin really didn't need to do anything... The fact that so many audience members LOVE this film is no proof of its merit... People loved The Waterboy.  Thus, these two films stand as testaments to the dumbing-down of America.  Mike Myers proves again that he can come up with a good idea and still find a way to ruin it with a sequel. To think there's going to be a third... let's hope Mike decides to go back to his roots and re-evaluate his bastardization of one of the more interesting comic characters in memory.

Confidential compels its audience to ask numerous times. The film, which is based on James Ellroy's novel offers two vastly differing views on the meaning of justice, explicated in the varying styles of police work that the characters perform. Each man represents a different and opposing discourse within the police department. There is much dialogic between each of the discourses. For example, the commander, Dudley says the department needs smart men (political men) like Exley and direct men like White. The differences between these characters will be discussed later on. At first each discourse exists in its own realm, in terms of binary oppositions. But later on, the characters realize that they cannot do their jobs to the utmost of their ability when they are stuck solely in their own methodology of police work, and therefore the story begins to deconstruct the various binary oppositions.BUD WHITE (Russell Crowe) - White is an officer who is ready at any moment to break the rules, taking the law into his own hands to ensure that justice is served, however he is barely able to keep his raging violence under control. In fact, he adhere's to violence as a necessary adjunct to the job. He has no problem being called upon to do dirty work such as beating confessions out of criminals. White is man, whose driving force seems to be that of seeking revenge for his dead mother (killed by his father). One of the interesting things about him is that he never hesitates to beat a man who inflicts harm to a woman.ED EXLEY (Guy Pierce) - Exley is the golden boy of the police force, and will do almost anything to get ahead, except sell out by breaking the rules of conduct. He is a straight-laced, strictly by the book officer, who shows his desire to get ahead by his willingness to speak out against other officers when he feels that they do something wrong. Are you truly prepared to be despised within the department, Dudley asks. Yes sir, I am, Exley replies. Dudley also asks him if he would be able to beat a confession out of a man he knew to be guilty, plant evidence on a man he knew to be guilty or shoot a man in the back in order to be sure that some hot shot lawyer would not be able to get him off. Of course, Exley's reply to all of these questions is no.JACK VINCENNES (Kevin Spacey) - Vincennes has a different agenda altogether, and it does not have much to do with justice at all, but nevertheless, his style marks a specific discourse within this particular police department, the LAPD. He wants the spotlight on television and the headlines in the newspaper. He is even the technical advisor for a T.V. show called Badge of Honor. In one brilliant scene Vincennes goes to a house to make an arrest for narcotics abuse and he wants a movie premier in the background of the picture taken by the press.Each of these three men represent different ways (or discourses) of conducting police work. At first, all of these discourses are depicted as separate, but constantly conversing and conflicting with one another.In the course of the film, the Night Owl massacre takes place where a number of patrons are killed as well as White's partner, Stenzland. As the film progresses, the men begin to realize that nothing is black and white and they must work together to solve the crime. Exley suspects that White is up to wrong-doing and thus needs a way of keeping tabs on him. Vincennes agrees to help Exley as long as Exley will help him with another case. The men who were before always displaying conflict are now working with each other. White and Exley are now the true opposing forces within the department and the two come to a violent confrontation when White finds out that they have both been sleeping with the same woman. But despite their differences and perhaps their hate for one another, the men are put in the position of having to put aside their differences and unite their ways in order to solve the case, as Exley has found evidence that another man in the department (that I will not mention) may be the mastermind behind the massacre.At this point it is evident that no one police discourse is going to be enough to solve this crime; both men realize it and accept it. This is exhibited most convincingly in the climax of the film when Exley has the mastermind at gunpoint. The man asks Exley, Are you going to shoot me or arrest me? We of course believe that Exley will make the arrest and further his reputation as the 'golden-boy'. We know this primarily from the earlier conversations between Dudley and Exley. But at the last possible moment, just before all of the backup arrives, Exley seemingly goes against himself and does something that neither he nor Dudley thought he was capable of doing. But the real question is; does he really go against himself? He may seemingly go against his own methodology, but does his view of justice really change or does he come to a higher realization of the essence of justice? I always find myself asking this question as the film ends.**** out of ****  ","genre":null},{"date":"17 June 1999","score":"","review":"  What is the meaning of the word 'justice'?
