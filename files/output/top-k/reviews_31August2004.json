That won't matter one bit. Believe me. And you will if you've seen this thing. Really.Anytime that the same name appears as the writer, the producer, and the director, one has to at least be mildly suspicious that nobody else seemed to want to help out. Add lead actor to the credits and you have a recipe for disaster. Somewhere Michael Medved's Golden Turkey is squawking at this load of horse excrement that through it's antidisestablishmentarianism reputation became something of a cult movie. As cult movies go, it is no better or worse than most. The bad thing about this gut buster is our hero, Tom Laughlin. Some things are impossible to fabricate. Tom's contribution to the list of such things is his decision to put himself on the credits as producer under a pseudonym. What false name did he use?, you ask. Why dear reader, he used the name Mary Rose Solti. See. I could not possibly have made that up. I checked the IMDb listing for dear old Tom and found that he's used enough pseudonyms in his career to be the most wanted interstate bank robber in history. Too bad he chose another calling. Enough about Tom! What could I say that hasn't already been said anyway. I will give him this much.....Billy Jack was an incredible investment that returned over 80 times the initial capital required to make it! It was, however, a case of a blind squirrel finding a nut. Tom just happened to be in the right place at the right time. The three (count them) movies that he made after this demonstrated even more heavy handed preachiness than Bea Arthur off of Prozac. Two of those three featured, you guessed it, Billy Jack! The other took place too long in the past for Billy Jack to have been born yet.Okay.....really enough about Tom!Billy Jack is the classic story of peaceful, back-to-harmony-with-nature good folk being put down by the man. Or in this case, rednecks. It seems that the Freedom School has run afoul of the local banjo-boys who want it shut down, bulldozed over, and replaced with a Wal-Mart. (I'm making the Wal-Mart part up because Wal-Mart had not, by the early seventies, penetrated as far as the desert southwest where the movie takes place.) The local ruffians, with the half-hearted help of the local constabulary are intent on running Jean Roberts and her subversive school out. They are being bankrolled by the big rancher who represents American greed and capitalism. Exactly what the school teaches (aside from Freedom) is never actually explained, nor is the vehement opposition to the school. Wait, it has to be that the school helps the local tribe and the bad guys are even worse than we thought because they are kicking the Native Americans when they are down and out and are perpetuating racial stereotypes and prejudice. Little do they know that their kids will someday be begging the tribe for janitorial jobs in the Bear Runs With Cash Casino. Maybe the Freedom School is teaching the finer arts of the gaming industry. We'll just never know. To this maelstrom of bad feelings and violent sentiment is introduced Billy Jack. He's a half-Indian half-White tribal policeman who just happens to have been a Green Beret and who just happens to be a martial arts expert and who just happens to be really messed up because he just happens to have been over in Nam. Since he is also doing a fairly decent Robert Blake impersonation, we know he is not to be trifled with and that sooner or later all that pent up rage is just going to boil over and erupt and it ..... Ooops, I'm rambling nearly as badly as the monosyllabic dialogue. Billy Jack knows injustice when he sees it and, wouldn't you know it, sometimes the only way for peace loving touchy-feely types to flourish is to get a genuine Bad Ass like Billy Jack to do their dirty work for them.Pretty soon, the rancher's son up and kills somebody (but not before raping his victim). Billy Jack can no longer rely on words. Sometimes an avenging angel's gotta do what an avenging angel's gotta do. With the help of his trademark Funky Hat, he kills the damnable miscreant. Oh yeah, the rape victim was Billy's love buddy. Since he has stepped over the line, he seeks sanctuary in a church (call him Quasimodo) but he gives himself up to an angry throng in order to prevent further death and chaos. I knew that Mel Gibson got that movie idea from somewhere, now I know where. We're left with the quick wrap and set-up for a sequel, The Trial of Billy Jack.....followed by the three-quel, Billy Jack Goes to Washington. Hey, a felony is no barrier to public service. Damn right.The plot is basic and emotionally charged. In the proper hands, this would have been done decently. For example, Sam Peckinpah would have had a scene in which someone has their ears torn off with vice-grips. That would have been great cinema! This train goes off the track at the outset with the theme song, One Tin Soldier. This song is, at best, a bad parody of really really bad folk-anthem. Hint I think the songwriter(s) really thought it was quite good, else they surely could not have slept at night.The trademark, Funky Hat, is almost a character in and of itself. Having been ten years old when this movie came out, I endured an entire decade of seeing really cool dudes wearing replicas of Funky Hat. They also wore black outfits and never seemed to have girlfriends (or boyfriends for that matter). Even today, there are those who still relish its feel on the head, its broad brimmed protection from the sun, and its ability to render the wearer totally ridiculous in appearance. I suppose you could hide a lot of pot up there in that dome and the customs officers at the border would never notice.....they'd be laughing too hard to make you take it off. In the proper hands this movie would have favored character development while blurring the lines between good and evil ala Norman Jewison. Not so in the ham fisted directorial style of Tom Laughlin (or should we call him Mary Rose?). Tom seems to subscribe to the school of cinema that holds that audiences only recognize extremely polarized characters. Either that, or Tom had some sort of experience with peyote that rendered him incapable of crafting two dimensional (let alone three dimensional) characters. Suffice to say, you are not going to find any conflicted good guys or bad guys here.There is not a single character that I wanted to see alive at the end of the movie. As the show drug on, I was hoping for some biblical justice that would wipe all these people from the earth.I'm not even going to delve into the total lack of production values. That would be akin to shooting fish in a barrel. Let's just say that Ed Wood put together more polished productions. I'm sorry to all of you who have such an excitement going for this movie.

It's films like these that show you the classic, amazing performances of Mr. Tom Cruise. Jerry Maguire was nominated for 5 Academy Awards in 1997. It only won one of them, which was given to Cuba Gooding Jr. for Best Supporting Actor. He definitely deserved it, but so did Cruise. Cruise was also nominated for Born on the 4th of July and Magnolia. Still, him being beaten by other actors. Will Cruise ever get his justice? Us Cruise fans are hoping that, this year of 2004.Jerry Maguire is about a sports agent, named Jerry Maguire who is played by Cruise (all pretty obvious there). He has a quick, busy life with many sports athletes to work with. Life sounds good, right. Well at the beginning of the movie, one of his clients has a sports accident and ends up in the hospital. With Jerry not showing his 100% care in most of his clients, things like this occur. His client's son says some words to him afterward and it makes Jerry realize what kind of heartless life he's had. How unhappy and somewhat evil his life had become. Well he rights a book about it and entitles it, The Things We Think, but Do Not Say. Everyone he knows, such as friends and co-workers, read it and think more highly of him now. Except for his boss.

Jan De Bont came hot off the heels of a great success with 'Speed', but unfortunately he couldn't make it two hits in a row. It is a shame, because Twister features lots of brilliantly thrilling action set pieces. The tornado ('Tornado' wasn't as striking a title as 'Twister') is one of nature's most extreme expressions of itself, and the scenes with the humans battling against it really do get the adrenaline running. Cows and 'debris', which consists of things such as Combine Harvesters, Petrol trucks, and my personal favourite; an entire house, which our hero's must drive straight through to get to safety, zip past the screen and cause our hero's all manner of trouble. This film has no problem with it's action side, so why doesn't it quite feel right?It's not a problem with casting, as this movie features a fairly good cast. My favourite actor, Bill Paxton heads it. Bill doesn't put in one of his best performances in this movie...actually, some parts are painful to watch, but Bill is definitely a talent and he makes the movie worth seeing. (He was my main reason for seeing it). Starring opposite Paxton is Helen Hunt. Helen would prove that she could act a year after this movie with the brilliant; As Good as it Gets in 1997, and she gives a decent performance here as the typical woman; bitchy, controlling but ultimately lovable. The Dread Pirate Roberts is the villain of the piece, but he doesn't really get a lot of screentime and to be honest, I don't rate him anyway. Jami Gertz is equally unimpressive as Bill's prissy, yet uncharismatic girlfriend; but those two are made up for by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who, despite having an extremely irritating character to work with, puts in a great little turn and steals nearly every scene he's in. So it's not a problem with the casting, so what's the problem?The human drama is the problem. Frankly, it's laughable. It isn't helped at all by a lacklustre script, which is cringe-worthy at times, but it's not even the script that really makes it falter; it's the complete lack of feeling for any of the characters. Of course, the tornado's are the real star of the show, but if you're going to include a human element; you have to at least make it work. The story behind the twisters is that Bill and Helen are married, but awaiting a divorce. Bill has found another woman in the form of Jami Gertz, and wants Helen to sign the divorce papers so he can remarry. However, life is never that simple and Bill and Helen are actually still in love; a love rekindled by a mutual love for the weather condition of the title, of course. The chemistry between these characters is non-existent and it really spoils the movie. I recognise the fact that you can't have a movie without a human element for the audience to relate to; but the one here is terrible. Just...awful.So, do I recommend Twister? Yes, it's action sequences are fantastic and the film is, therefore, well worth 2 hours of anyone's time for those sequences alone. The movie is definitely good entertainment, but it would have been a lot better with a decent script and characters that you can feel for.

Jan De Bont came hot off the heels of a great success with 'Speed', but unfortunately he couldn't make it two hits in a row. It is a shame, because Twister features lots of brilliantly thrilling action set pieces. The tornado ('Tornado' wasn't as striking a title as 'Twister') is one of nature's most extreme expressions of itself, and the scenes with the humans battling against it really do get the adrenaline running. Cows and 'debris', which consists of things such as Combine Harvesters, Petrol trucks, and my personal favourite; an entire house, which our hero's must drive straight through to get to safety, zip past the screen and cause our hero's all manner of trouble. This film has no problem with it's action side, so why doesn't it quite feel right?It's not a problem with casting, as this movie features a fairly good cast. My favourite actor, Bill Paxton heads it. Bill doesn't put in one of his best performances in this movie...actually, some parts are painful to watch, but Bill is definitely a talent and he makes the movie worth seeing. (He was my main reason for seeing it). Starring opposite Paxton is Helen Hunt. Helen would prove that she could act a year after this movie with the brilliant; As Good as it Gets in 1997, and she gives a decent performance here as the typical woman; bitchy, controlling but ultimately lovable. The Dread Pirate Roberts is the villain of the piece, but he doesn't really get a lot of screentime and to be honest, I don't rate him anyway. Jami Gertz is equally unimpressive as Bill's prissy, yet uncharismatic girlfriend; but those two are made up for by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who, despite having an extremely irritating character to work with, puts in a great little turn and steals nearly every scene he's in. So it's not a problem with the casting, so what's the problem?The human drama is the problem. Frankly, it's laughable. It isn't helped at all by a lacklustre script, which is cringe-worthy at times, but it's not even the script that really makes it falter; it's the complete lack of feeling for any of the characters. Of course, the tornado's are the real star of the show, but if you're going to include a human element; you have to at least make it work. The story behind the twisters is that Bill and Helen are married, but awaiting a divorce. Bill has found another woman in the form of Jami Gertz, and wants Helen to sign the divorce papers so he can remarry. However, life is never that simple and Bill and Helen are actually still in love; a love rekindled by a mutual love for the weather condition of the title, of course. The chemistry between these characters is non-existent and it really spoils the movie. I recognise the fact that you can't have a movie without a human element for the audience to relate to; but the one here is terrible. Just...awful.So, do I recommend Twister? Yes, it's action sequences are fantastic and the film is, therefore, well worth 2 hours of anyone's time for those sequences alone. The movie is definitely good entertainment, but it would have been a lot better with a decent script and characters that you can feel for.

While there may come a time when Ray Winstone is known for playing bespectacled nuclear physicists rather than cockney criminals it has to be said that this is most definitely not it. Nor is the casting of Winstone the only predictable thing about Sexy Beast, being the tale of retired Costa Del Crime blagger Gary 'Gal' Dove (Winstone) tempted out of retirement for one last job.

Yet, like Anthony Hopkins in the Hannibal movies, what Kingsley lacks in brute strength he more than makes up for in the mind games department.

Every single individual whether it be producers, director, writer or actors (minus Chris O'Donnell) should be Bat-Whipped for this piece of junk. This is your typical absolutely cannot fail franchise in film getting raped by studio execs making critical content decisions about a film when they have no talent to do so. Batman is popular simply because of the comic book not because of that retarded TV show starring Adam West, but this movie is more fashioned after that campy trash. This was nothing but a slap in the face to every true fan of the Batman. The direction of Joel Schumacher was deplorable. The set designs looked cheap (the ice looked and acted like dried craft glue) and were visually painful, especially the overuse of the red neon hue in many scenes. The digital effects were OK but often over done. The production cost was extensive, and I wonder what percentage of the budget went to the salaries of Arnold, George, Uma and Alicia. I'm sure it was high. I know Arnold got $20 million, so the percentage had to be fairly high. Well, everyone one of them needed to give back large portions of their salaries because their performances were atrocious. Alicia Silverstone needs to give her entire salary back. Hers was probably one the worst performances ever in a major motion picture. Arnold can't act anyway so I wasn't really expecting much, but I was disappointed when I heard he was cast as Freeze because he in no way fits that character. Freeze was a scientist and when I look at Arnold my first thought is not Scientist. Ben Kingsly or Patrick Stewart would have fit better. Uma, who is normally a credible actress, was too drama queen which made it hard to immerse yourself in scenes she was in. Clooney was totally miscast as Bruce Wayne\/Batman. I mean it's hard not to laugh when Batman is shorter than Robin. George like Uma was too overly dramatic, especially in scenes with Alfred, which made it hard to take him seriously. Chris O'Donnell was really the only actor that seemed real. With all that, I would have to say the overwhelmingly worst part of this movie was the script. Akiva Goldsman should have been banned from Hollywood after this script. It was a completely brainless jumbled mess. The story, which was pitiful at best, gets completely lost in entirely too many characters. It was so frustrating seeing the origins of certain characters ripped too shreds as Goldsman attempted to jam them into the script. Batgirl, who should have never been in this film in the first place, was changed from Commissioner Gordon's daughter to Alfred's niece, which made absolutely no sense. In an attempt, to explain why Freeze was so muscular it was explained he was an Olympic gymnast. How freakin' stupid is that? Gymnasts by necessity need to be small in stature to perform well in gymnastics and Arnold is enormous. Goldsman's use of dialogue was highly irritating consisting of nothing but one juvenile one-liner after another after another after another. One other thing that really irritated me was the complete mishandling and waste of the character Bane. Bane is a much more complex and vicious villain in the comics, and this movie version with Bane reduces him to a mindless henchman. Bane deserves much more character development than he received in B&R. The same thing happened in Forever, when one of the most highly complex and interesting villains in the comics, Two-Face, got reduced to second billing. Note to Warner Bros. stop screwing with Batman he can sell himself, and stop trying to cram so many characters into the films, and understand nobody wants to see a Campy Caped Crusader.

While the twist at the end takes some considerable thought to truly understand, it is nonetheless an incredibly feat of misdirection. A truly beautiful mix of Intellectualism and Brutality; one of my favourite films of all time.By the Way; If you haven't seen this film yet I'm not going to give you a synopsis of the storyline; you don't need one.

Richard Lewellyn's novel must have been one source of inspiration for bringing to life this story about a small town in Wales. The director had the good fortune to have Arthur Miller as his cinematographer for this tale about the stark conditions about the miners' lives. The small town comes alive by the vivid account one sees on the screen. At times, what we are witnessing before our eyes, remind us of the work of great photographers such as Margaret Bourke-White, whose pictures for the old Life magazine parallel Mr. Miller's stark photography in the film.Mr. Ford uses songs in most of his films. In this movie as well as in The Quiet Man, this device enhances what we are watching. The songs are diversions for the stark reality in the miners' lives. Their every day misery is somehow eased when they sing with clear voices ancient folk melodies they, and their forefathers, have always known.The Morgan family is at the center of the story. We hear the narration from Huw, the youngest member of this family. All the men work in the mine; they are all disillusioned by the working conditions and meager wages that they give without hesitation to the matriarch when they are paid. They appear content at the beginning of the film, but we watch them gradually abandon their village in search of a better life; who can blame them?The cast assembled by Mr. Ford is first rate. Donald Crisp, as the patriarch of the Morgan family outdoes himself in this film. Walter Pidgeon as the local church pastor is excellent. The young and radiant beauty of Maureen O'Hara was so powerful, we can't stop watching her for a moment when she is on screen. Roddy McDowall as the youngest child of the clan in his first appearance is also a magnetic presence that holds the viewer's attention all the time.The rest of the actors do incredible ensemble work to support the principals. Anna Lee, John Loder, Barry Fitzgerald, Anne Todd make us believe they are the characters they are playing. Ultimately this is a John Ford's triumph. He is the force that welds everything together and in spite of all the bad things that happen to the family and the town, he seems to be telling us there still is hope and life will continue.

I watched this movie because I enjoy documentaries and always seek to educate myself. Unfortunately this movie hardly qualifies as educational since it fails to present context, commits the logical fallacy of 'appealing to emotion' and is simply an ingenious masterpiece of manipulation. Please be smart enough to question the things that a brilliant propagandist like Michael Moore presents to you and look deeper with a critical eye.I assume that the majority of people who watched this movie already knew they like Moore and were going to agree with any argument he presented; therefore they rave about it's insight without putting any additional thought into what they have seen. These people shouldn't bother to read my review any farther- they have already made up their mind and don't seek to learn anything. For those interested in some critical thinking here goesMovie SummaryMichael Moore focuses his attention on the town of Flint, Michigan after massive GM layoffs have caused an increase in poverty and crime. He interviews citizens of the town and pursues GM CEO Roger Smith under the guise of 'An Interview'. In what has become Moore's trademark style he interviews people that we are obviously going to feel bad for (since we don't envy their position). He mixes these interviews with clips that make the guilty parties look stupid. He then follows with attempts to badger other guilty parties into interviews which they sensibly refuse to accept (making them look even guiltier).Critical Thoughts1) What a display of selfishness and egocentrism!! People around the country and world starve to death, live in filth and crime and never get a chance at a better life... but never mind them, lets focus on the people of Flint and demand something better for them! The people of Flint have had access to some of the best educational opportunities in the world, they live in a country where basic education is mandatory and higher education can be paid for by the government (either through loans or the GI Bill). In lieu of this many people of the Flint, Michigan area were tempted by the fruits of a high paying unskilled union job that can be easily replaced by foreign workers or automation. It sounds harsh... but when people think short term and fail to invest in themselves this can easily happen. If you want someone to blame for this, blame you local union who jacks up the price of labor far beyond what its really worth. When you can make $20 for doing a job that requires no skill its inevitable that the company will move your job somewhere else. Once again, we need to stop being self centered and realize that $20 will save a whole village from starvation when a job is moved to a foreign country.2)Moore makes fun of Flint's local government for trying to bring tourists into the area. Sadly the government tries to do something productive that will bring long term resources into the area and Moore just criticizes it. Sure, Autoworld and a Hyatt may be bad ideas, but who can you blame for this, the politicians or the people who elected those politicians into office? Our government is a Republic, which means we choose people to make important decisions for us (a government for the people, of the people... kind of). Democracies and republics depend on an educated population who can choose wisely- when our government makes a poor decision, we must accept that ultimately we are to blame for it. In regards to this whole segment of the movie, my real gripe is that Moore simply criticized the governments good natured attempts to improve things and offers no suggestions for how he would have done things differently. Keep in my this segment of the movie is littered with clips intended to make the local politicians look stupid.3) Capitalism works, deal with it. I have a relative that only buys domestic vehicles. Although the intent behind this is good, it completely destroys a fundamental attribute of America's success competition spurs innovation. When people buy things because they are American made they don't motivate domestic auto makers to improve their product, they allow the manufacturer to become complacent and eventually destroy any competitive edge the company has. My point here is, that if GM wants to stay in business it must be competitive. In order to be competitive, GM must maximize profits. In order to maximize profits GM cannot use old world manufacturing techniques that at 'new world' prices (they can't pay top dollar for manual labor when they could be using automation for the same cost or low dollar labor with the same or better quality). Keep in mind that at the time this movie was made, American auto companies were losing business to Japanese auto makers who were making a better quality, cheaper, more efficient vehicle. In order for GM to progress it had to refine its processes; sadly this meant that it had to lay off the people of Flint. This has happened for scores of years as America has evolved, the coal cities died, the steel cities died, and in the end the country will evolve and be better because we learn to adapt rather than to make silly business decisions.4) CONSTANT APPEAL TO EMOTION!!! When an academic tries to argue a point they supply facts in valid logical form and draw conclusions. When Michael Moore tries to argue a point he presents some facts, presents a conclusion and fills the gap between the two by appealing to your feelings of guilt for the victims, disgust for the guilty and condescension toward any who disagree. I MUST ADMIT THAT I DIDN'T FINISH THIS MOVIE. When Moore showed a woman hit a rabbit on the head and then proceed to skin it, I turned the movie off. This display of barbarism was intended to make me sick that these poor people were lowered to this level. I admit that the scene made me sick, but I was sick that these uneducated oafs would resort to animal cruelty instead of going to another town to look for a job! This scene actually convinced me that GM did the right thing by moving the plant since the only natural resource in the area was a ubiquitous abundance of white trash. I was even further sickened by the fact that Moore would feel that it was necessary to show this scene... it provides absolutely no LOGICAL value to the movie. It does however make all of Moore's minions cringe and blame the death of the rabbit on Roger Smith and corporate America.Sorry to ramble on, but I saw this movie and I was disappointed. Disappointed that Americans will only watch documentaries that are actually entertainment\/political statements rather than educational and disappointed that so many suckers watch this garbage and just believe it without thinking twice. On a final note I will admit that Moore is a genius in this genre; he has found a formula that captures people's attention and makes them feel superior. The viewers think they are watching a high-brow documentary and can join in on the condescension of politicians and wealthy elderly female golfers. Hopefully since Moore is now a deca-millionaire after the release of Fahrenheit 9\/11 he will give away all his money to the people of Flint since he feels that they so rightfully deserve special treatment- lets be honest though, both you and I know that Moore's compassion ends at his own wallet.

Stewart is his usual self, and managed to be quite funny in some scenes, and the supporting cast is fun too, but Lemon could have been used a bit more than he was.The biggest mystery was just how little magic was used in the movie. There were a couple scenes but there were no big showy special effects used, not that I needed that but you would think there would be more in this type of movie since it's about witches and warlocks.

Another bunch resign. One dies. Drawings are stolen. Production is delayed endlessly. You would think that if ever a Disney feature were destined for disaster, this was it. Instead, 'Fox and the Hound' is probably the best Disney animated feature of its generation. You could clear a space about 10 years either side of it before you ran into something that gave it serious competition.We start with an orphaned fox kit - pardon me as my jaw doesn't drop in amazement. There have been, what - TWO Disney films where both parents survive? And, well, he is adopted by an elderly widow named Tweed, he develops a friendship with a hunting dog owned by Widow Tweed's crochety neighbor, and he starts to grow up, and life suddenly becomes very difficult, dangerous, and emotionally complicated.I won't give it away, in case you haven't seen it, but for my money this movie has close to the saddest, most desolate, tear-jerking scene in any Disney film I can think of. But don't worry, it bounces back well and truly. This is a long way from being a morose film. In fact it's an excellent balance of drama, action, pathos and humour. My only minor complaint is that there are a couple of comic sidekicks in this movie that are pretty annoying and contribute just about nothing to the story.Coming after 'The Rescuers', 'The Fox and the Hound' might have been the start of a Disney resurrection, but perhaps Bluth's departure really was a body blow. As it is, 'Fox and the Hound' is a moment of beauty and brilliance in the otherwise pretty murky first 20 or so years after Walt's death.Although it didn't cause much of a stir at the time, it has developed a deserved base of loyal fans in the twenty-three years since it was made.The film tackles themes of conflicting loyalties, friendship, love, identity, and somehow does it with a minimum of schmaltz and a maximum of heart. It's one of Disney's best, and you owe it to yourself to see it.9 out of 10Historical Note Mickey Rooney plays the adult Tod, the fox in 'Fox and the Hound'. According to Rooney's 1991 autobiography, when he was 5 years old he wandered into an office at Warner during breaks between shooting in one of his child-star films, and introduced himself to a bloke who turned out to be Walt Disney, and who was in the process of drawing a new mouse character, who he decided on the spot to name after Mickey. It just tops it off nicely, doesn't it?
