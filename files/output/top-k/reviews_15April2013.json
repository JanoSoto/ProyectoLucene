Would make one day a amazing Roman epic since Ben-Hur and Spartacus. And speaking of the extended edition (only available on Blue-ray) could not only overcome in several details the original, but also be another masterpiece of Ridley Scott's career.The film tells the story of the Roman general, the Spanish Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe). Maximus is on a military campaign in the barbaric Germania, led by the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), which has lasted over ten years. Aurelius sees in Maximus courage and humility, and the spirit of a true leader, as a proof the love and admiration that the Roman army has for Maximus. Aurelius and Maximus nurture a big friendship and a love of father and son, which led to Aurelius appoint Maximus to be the new leader of Rome after his death, instructing Maximus to make Rome a republic again. But Maximus hesitate just because he expects his military pantry and return to his family in Spain, but the respect he has for the Emperor is very large. Everything changes when the arrogant and envious son of Aurelius, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) kills his father and orders the execution of Maximus and his family. Maximus manages to escape and return home, where he finds his wife and children crucified beside the door. Maximus is arrested and later sold to a gladiator trainer Proximo (Oliver Reed), which later becomes the best among them, and sees a path to revenge.You could say that Gladiator is Ridley Scott's Braveheart. As it is filmed in the same realistic and violent style, but (in my opinion) can be much more epic. The direction of Ridley Scott is a great help, along with a dazzling cinematography on each scene. Both in spectacular epic battles (inside and outside the visually stunning Coliseum) and the superb dialog scenes.A major problem with films like Spartacus and Braveheart was connecting the dialog with the characters, which sometimes it failed and couldn't maintain a line of fiction with true historical facts, often not loyal at all. But I think Scott knew that and hired the right screenwriter for the job, David Franzoni. The writer of Amistad along with John Logan and William Nicholson, can build a superb narrative to the film from start to finish. Achieving at the same time creating a fiction story, and be extremely loyal to historical facts of the Roman Empire.This is mostly seen in the extended version of the film.

In 1993 Steven Spielberg blew the world away with groundbreaking CGI dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. Jurassic has intense moments with unforgettable characters and lines that are quoted time and time again. The basic premise is that a millionaire wants to open a theme park that features scientifically engineered dinosaurs, but before he can open it he needs to make sure it is safe so he brings a team to the island and it all goes to hell when the dinosaurs escape and run wild all over the park. This highly entertaining film is considered a classic and is up there in one of my favorites.I say a few things a lot when it comes to movies. Music makes the movie. And The first few scenes are curtail. If a movie an do that than its on a good start to getting the Seal of Approval. Jurassic Park didn't disappoint as the very first scene is a quick incident at the park involving the raptors but more on them later. It then kind of slows down with a lot of explanation but if you listen to the conversations then you should be sucked right in. The music is absolutely fantastic as well. Everybody knows the Jurassic Park theme and the very first shot of the island the theme kicks in and you know it's about to get real and the movie starts to get good. Then it gets even better. The very first shot of any dinosaur is the Brontosaurus and it looks fantastic. It looks beyond real and they shot on site. It's the same with all the dinosaurs; they look amazing and are still some of the best special effects I have ever seen to date. Now let's get into characters. Jurassic Park was originally a book written by my favorite author Michael Crichton, God rest his soul, so he already created the characters so the actors just had to play it properly. Ian Malcolm is one of my favorite characters ever. His wit and brilliance fit in perfectly and Jeff Goldblum plays him. He delivers memorable lines. Ah, life will find a way. God creates dinosaurs, God destroys dinosaurs, God creates man, Man creates dinosaurs, Man destroys God. Malcolm has trouble speaking, literally, and I love everything about this character. Everything he says doesn't sound like it could happen but he is the only one with any sense. My favorite scene is when everybody is eating lunch discussing the park.This scene is just great conversation and is the reality of the situation. Sam Neil plays Dr. Allen Grant, the main character and hero and in this scene he says it best. I love remembering lines but I can't remember word for word, but basically he says that dinosaurs have been extinct for 65 million years and how can anybody know what to expect now that they are back in another time period. Personally everything scientific about this movie is fascinating and makes it that much better. When I was younger I found it boring and only wanted to see dinosaurs eat people but with a more mature look at the move I see the brilliance and wonder of Spielberg and Crichton.I read the book Jurassic Park and I loved it for what it was. Seeing it on the big screen was a lot different from the book. There were characters in the book that were a lot more important. The man who gives Newman the can to get the embryos off the island, Dogson, is so much more important in the books and the movie doesn't do him justice. One could make an argument for Muldoon but think his character was well represented even though he played a bigger role in the book. Also Dr. Wu is a significant side character and he is only in one scene and his name is only mentioned. Then there are the Compys which are the scavengers of the dinosaur world and they aren't even in the movie at all. Things like this really bugged me until I saw the credits the other day and found out that Crichton wrote the screen play or was involved with the writing so he chose what to cut out, so I was OK with it. At least he gave a lot of focus on the raptors in the movie. If you ask any kid before 1993 what their favorite dinosaur is, they are going to say the T-Rex. If you ask any kid in the 90s or maybe any kid today they will say the raptor. These things were so intelligent and fast, the perfect hunter. They establish themselves as the elite villain in the movie and everybody is afraid of them. If you say you didn't jump when the raptor scared Ellie in the basement thing, then you're just lying to yourself. Another great scene is early on when Dr. Grant scares the life out of the little kid about how the raptor feeds. The look on his face was priceless. After seeing this movie raptors are easily my favorite dinosaur because they are intense and they get approved.Overall, Jurassic Park is an amazing movie with special effects that still hold up today. The visuals look even better than most CGI movies we see today. For incredible characters, unforgettable dialogue, intense action sequences, a high re-watch value, and just because it has dinosaurs in general Jurassic Park gets the WillyT seal of approval. If you haven't seen this movie yet then I have nothing to say to you other than you haven't lived. See this movie, It is a great time alone or with friends. Let's be honest, nothing looks cooler than the T-Rex tearing through the electric fence. WillyT out!

Though all the shows are distinct, with only a few cross-overs (such as the return of HMS PINAFORE's Captain Corcoran in UTOPIA, LIMITED) the world they construct is as individual as the world created by Dickens or Wodehouse (closer in the spirit to the latter).This movie concerns the writing and staging of Gilbert and Sullivan's most beloved operetta, THE MIKADO. The period style and costuming is sumptuous and the world created is delectable. Apparently they did not want the period to look too lived-in, apart from a few scenes set outside the theatrical world.The big question first Is the movie worth watching for genuine G&S fans? Yes! The best thing about Topsy-Turvy is the music. The tunes from THE MIKADO are good, but added in are snippets of the rarely heard PRINCESS IDA and, as the end credits roll, an inexplicable instrumental Climbing Over Rocky Mountains from THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE. Anyone who delights in Sullivan's music will have a toe-tapping good time.What about the person who is not yet a fan of Gilbert and Sullivan, or who never heard of them? Well, backstage movies about shows being put together always have an appeal (Forty-Second Street, The Band Wagon, Noises Off . . .). However, this film is not necessarily chronological; and it inter-cuts scenes of the completed MIKADO with scenes of the show's development, which might be confusing. And many references are made in passing, without any explanation, that will be explicable only to G&S scholars. Ignore them. Just enjoy the music.The story, such as it is, is easy to follow. Gilbert and Sullivan have labored long to produce comic operettas for D'Oyly Carte, including HMS PINAFORE and THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE. Gilbert and D'Oyly Carte want the shows to continue, but Sullivan wants to write serious music, including a grand opera. Sullivan is tired of Gilbert's absurd plots (and he's also tired of Gilbert as a person).Then, after visiting a Japanese exhibit in London, Gilbert gets the idea for an operetta set in Japan, THE MIKADO. It's so good he easily wins Sullivan over (lots of drama could have been squeezed out of this, but apparently the process was just as easy as presented).Then the cast is assembled and Topsy-Turvy becomes a backstage story of assembling a professional show, opening all sorts of little dramatic whirlpools in the lives of the cast and crew -- especially lead single Leonora Braham (Shirley Henderson), who is on the verge of losing her job from drink; and Richard Temple (Timothy Spall), who plays the Mikado himself, but whose big number (about all he really does in the show) is cut just before opening.In telling the story, the movie-makers prefer to follow the legends. Gilbert claimed he was inspired to write the piece by a Samurai sword falling from his wall, and this is depicted in detail. Jim Broadbent's wordless performance as the idea comes to him is a wonder to behold. Was it true? Who knows, it makes a good movie; and Broadbent is superb as Gilbert, especially in that moment of ideation.On the negative side, the movie presents the lead comic singer, George Grossmith, as an addict with a needle in his arm. Though rumors did suggest such a thing, no evidence is extant. This presentation seems unnecessary as they already had the minor subplot of Leonora Braham's struggle with alcohol.A few red flags Though Gilbert was a stern, domineering, litigious man in real life, peremptory with his collaborator, the theater management, his singers, and just about everyone else, I don't know that he treated his wife this badly. He wasn't a heartless scoundrel (he died trying to save a woman from drowning); he just liked things to go his way, especially if money was involved.And the worst thing of all for a Savoyard -- the movie treats the beloved Jesse Bond as a bit of an idiot. Whatever other liberties the film makers took, their treatment of Jesse Bond is quite unforgivable.There is also an unnecessary lapse into nudity. It's not done in an erotic way and the nudes are quite unattractive. Yet that scene could well have gotten its point across without resorting to crudity. What would Gilbert have thought? Still, overall, the performances are excellent, the production values are first-rate, and the singing, as done by the actual actors, was probably about that good in real life.SPOILER ALERT! Apart from the few advisements above, Topsy-Turvy might have been a feel-good movie if they had ended it with the end of THE MIKADO itself. Instead, it tacks on a few more scenes of the domestic Gilbert and Sullivan at the end that drag one down from feelings of sheer euphoria. Nevertheless, they do bring Leonora Braham back at the very end with The Sun Whose Rays are All Ablaze. Wonderful.If you like G&S, go for it. If you like backstage stories, try this on for size.

Next to Pulp Fiction, Fargo is one of the best modern day noir film with the Coen formula of tragedy mixed with high prolific humour and violence that will make anyone's blood curdle.Fargo is one of those obscure movies that has no real negative sayings about it. Based on actual events that occurred in Noth Dakota\/Minnesota in 1987, the movie tells the tale about a financially unstable car dealer named Jerry Lundergaard (William H. Macy) as he cooks up a plot to have his wife Jen (Kristin Rudrud) kidnapped. So he hires two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormere) who are kind of short on brains and seem to mess things up all the time. This leads to the local Sheriff Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) to seek justice on this whole predicament.What makes this film really special compared to other Coen Brothers films is that the script provides a very diabolical dark humour and the dialogue is near perfect thank mainly to the leading performers William H.

Looking to lash out at the world, Mark starts an FM pirate radio station. This station becomes an outlet for his angst and aggression. The film then becomes a teen version of Network or Rebel Without a Cause, Mark rallying fellow disaffected and alienated youths until he becomes the unwitting leader of a minor student revolution.In historical terms, Hunter's caught in the deadlock of late capitalism, or what Francis Fukuyama called the end of history, a time populated by what Nietzsche called the last men; pathetic, contemptible things. Fukuyama's position counterpointed that of Hegel and Marx, who saw historical development as a purposeful journey from primitive stages of consciousness to something better. This goes against the there is no alternative (T.I.N.A) mantra of late capitalism, a stance explicitly reborn in the mid 20th century, but which has bee around in various forms much longer, perhaps starting with Thomas Malthus, a nineteenth century progenitor of no alternative politics and its credo of permanent scarcity and necessary poverty. Malthus contested nineteenth century radicals who were steadfast in their belief that labour, properly deployed, could usher in a new society. Indeed, the initial need for elites to publicly announce the absence of any alternative to existing social arrangements was entirely a defensive move, in response to such radical ideas.One of the first to counter T.I.N.A was William Godwin. In his 1793 book, Enquiry Concerning Political Justice, he argued that the existing state creates a servile and truckling spirit, and that the cruel monotony of the system produces a kind of stupid and hopeless vacancy in every face. From Godwin can be drawn a line to libertarians, anarchist communism, socialism and even the labour theory of value. The British government then tried to prosecute Godwin for treason, but abandoned the idea. Godwin was instead attacked by Malthus, who in Principles of Political Economy essentially defended class structures and even went so far as to advocate starving the poor because that way they wouldn't breed too heavily. In anticipation of the permanent war economy of the United States, Malthus would even offer war and state debt as perfect mechanisms for enhancing value through the careful calibration of scarcity.So though white and privileged, Hunter's part of a long list of validly ticked off people. On air he calls himself Hard Harry, and begins his radio program with Leonard Cohen's Everybody Knows, the lyrics everybody knows the dice are loaded, everybody rolls with their fingers crossed heralding his audio rants. All the great themes have been used up and turned into theme parks, he tells his audience, as he begins to develop a sort of naive political manifesto. Where adults condescend, he empathises, where they ignore, he provides an outlet for the hopes, dreams, fears and tragedies of other youths.Elsewhere Hunter challenges the ethos of his college, which cares more about test scores and image than actual education. Unsurprisingly, his college is named after Hubert Humphrey, a despicable archetype of cold war neoliberalism and apologist for much violence (Vietnam, the police beatings of peace activists etc). The truth is a virus, Hunter tells his listeners, as he becomes increasingly subversive and empowering, shaking fellow students out of apathy. It begins with us! Not the experts, but the ones who need it most! Pretty soon he's changed from an object of hero worship to one of strategic appropriation, youths taking from him what they need to advance their own empowerment and emancipation. Elsewhere the songs he plays are politically charged, but in offbeat ways. There's Freedom of Speech by Above the Law, Ice T states I've no time to whisper in your ear, Hunter plays Wave of Mutilation by the Pixies, has Soundgarden say Accused and convicted for nothing and Liquid Jesus Stand, and they will make you crawl.Nothing is more important than a good education! adults tell Hunter. Except the basic right to it, he counters. Slowly he moves from isolation and individualism to community and collective action. He accepts that he has a responsibility to his listeners, understands that meaning and expression are terrains of political contestation, repeatedly fought over, but then quickly finds himself chased by the police and FBI. They want to shut him down. To silence him. The film ends with Harry on the run, romantic engagement finally deemed inadequate, until a final sequence in which every student in America starts their own pirate radio station. This is offered as something positive, but the internet\/Facebook generation's told us otherwise the podiums afforded by technology increase atomization and tend to become just more outlets for narcissism.Traditionally, young people have energised democratic movements. But resistance to domination has been subdued and power has long created societal institutions designed to break resistance. The young, reflexively impotent, are perhaps now entirely acquiesced to the idea that they can and will be repeatedly screwed. Large debts, and the fear they create, have become a pacifying force. Elsewhere we psychopathologize and medicate noncompliance, a fact which led Erich Fromm to state that today the function of psychiatry and medicine threatens to become the tool in the manipulation of man. Indeed, schools themselves inculcate compliance not democracy, and routinely traffic standardisation and fear.

The British government then tried to prosecute Godwin for treason, but abandoned the idea. Godwin was instead attacked by Malthus, who in Principles of Political Economy essentially defended class structures and even went so far as to advocate starving the poor because that way they wouldn't breed too heavily. In anticipation of the permanent war economy of the United States, Malthus would even offer war and state debt as perfect mechanisms for enhancing value through the careful calibration of scarcity.So though white and privileged, Hunter's part of a long list of validly ticked off people. On air he calls himself Hard Harry, and begins his radio program with Leonard Cohen's Everybody Knows, the lyrics everybody knows the dice are loaded, everybody rolls with their fingers crossed heralding his audio rants. All the great themes have been used up and turned into theme parks, he tells his audience, as he begins to develop a sort of naive political manifesto. Where adults condescend, he empathises, where they ignore, he provides an outlet for the hopes, dreams, fears and tragedies of other youths.Elsewhere Hunter challenges the ethos of his college, which cares more about test scores and image than actual education. Unsurprisingly, his college is named after Hubert Humphrey, a despicable archetype of cold war neoliberalism and apologist for much violence (Vietnam, the police beatings of peace activists etc). The truth is a virus, Hunter tells his listeners, as he becomes increasingly subversive and empowering, shaking fellow students out of apathy. It begins with us! Not the experts, but the ones who need it most! Pretty soon he's changed from an object of hero worship to one of strategic appropriation, youths taking from him what they need to advance their own empowerment and emancipation. Elsewhere the songs he plays are politically charged, but in offbeat ways. There's Freedom of Speech by Above the Law, Ice T states I've no time to whisper in your ear, Hunter plays Wave of Mutilation by the Pixies, has Soundgarden say Accused and convicted for nothing and Liquid Jesus Stand, and they will make you crawl.Nothing is more important than a good education! adults tell Hunter. Except the basic right to it, he counters. Slowly he moves from isolation and individualism to community and collective action. He accepts that he has a responsibility to his listeners, understands that meaning and expression are terrains of political contestation, repeatedly fought over, but then quickly finds himself chased by the police and FBI. They want to shut him down. To silence him. The film ends with Harry on the run, romantic engagement finally deemed inadequate, until a final sequence in which every student in America starts their own pirate radio station. This is offered as something positive, but the internet\/Facebook generation's told us otherwise the podiums afforded by technology increase atomization and tend to become just more outlets for narcissism.Traditionally, young people have energised democratic movements. But resistance to domination has been subdued and power has long created societal institutions designed to break resistance. The young, reflexively impotent, are perhaps now entirely acquiesced to the idea that they can and will be repeatedly screwed. Large debts, and the fear they create, have become a pacifying force. Elsewhere we psychopathologize and medicate noncompliance, a fact which led Erich Fromm to state that today the function of psychiatry and medicine threatens to become the tool in the manipulation of man. Indeed, schools themselves inculcate compliance not democracy, and routinely traffic standardisation and fear. The intelligent are shamed, surveillance is normalised and fundamentalist Religion and Fundamentalist Consumerism are exalted above all things. And so, like Howard Beale, Hunter yells from a radio, before being shut down.8.9\/10 &#x96; One of the best teen movies of the 1990s, despite a weak, corny third act.

I'm indisputably way past the age which will be exalting to watch this family-friendly vaudeville for the very first time, I wish I could have done that around my childhood year so I would be more in shock-and-awe admiration for this haute crowd-pleaser and ground-breaking studio- based product. It all begins in Kansas, young Dorothy lives in a farm with his uncle and auntie, (after a melancholic rendition of OVER THE RAINBOW, still astounding and flawless) her tentative runaway with her cuddly puppy Toto has been persuaded by Professor Marvel (a very first introduction of multi-personae performance from Frank Morgan), en route, a twister rampages the farm and Dorothy and Toto (along with the house) has been brought to Wizard Oz's wonderland with the casualty of a star-crossed wicked witch (crushed by the house accidentally), and the shoddy superimposition of the airborne journey may be cutting-edge 74 years earlier, sadly it barely works even under an uncritical eye. The tangible visual transference from sepia farmland to the variegated Oz land grants a soothing refreshment and heralds a jovial adventure ahead, sing-a-longs with DING DONG THE WITCH IS DEAD (new entry at No. 2 in this week at UK Singles Chart in the wake of Thatcher's death), it is just carefree and mollifying one's hard-pressed nerves (if you have those). Then the classic characters (Scarecrow, Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion) successively accompany Dorothy to meet the great and mighty Oz. Despite of its all-comprising industry-reeking indoor design, it is a marvel how the film could be made in such a laborious scale and obedient order at its time, entering the second half of the film, when insouciant singing-and-dancing gives its way to the escapade of taking back the broomstick of The Wicked Witch of the West, all the set pieces are incontrovertibly stale and the logic of the story sags into an untenable farce (no specific elucidation of how the witch would succumb to a basin of water or what is so special about the red shoes the witch is hankering for, et al). The guarded-gate of the witch's castle must be the recipient of the homage from Sauron's gate from THE LORD OF THE RINGS.Acting-wise, Judy Garland is humble, mawkish but naturalistic in delivering jejune lines, Bert Lahr's Lion and Ray Bolger's Scarecrow otherwise are the film's best offers, also Margaret Hamilton's heinous witch, simply wish she had more venom to spill.

I assumed the were cloying and I hate child actors. However, I ran into a problem on Netflix--I'd seen just about everything and ALL of the classic films. So, reluctantly, I decided to try a couple. To my surprise, the films are, for the most part, delightful--much of it because Temple was a simply amazing child actress. No matter how much I knew the studio was manipulating the audience, I just couldn't help but adore the child. Despite being almost like the product of some unholy breeding experiment because she was SO perfect, I just couldn't resist her charm.Of all the Shirley Temple movies I've seen (and by now I've seen most), I would have to say that Bright Eyes is the best. It is sweet but it also has a nice balance of nastiness that really helps the film along. Let me explain...while Shirley is wonderful, counter-balancing it with the Smythe family, and especially their bratty child (Jane Withers). I loved Withers in the film--she played the most bratty and nasty little girl--and it took a lot of talent to make her character THIS awful! So, we have two of the greatest child actresses of all-time in one film! The plot is, in some ways, a bit like Cinderella...just a bit. It begins with Shirley and her widowed mother living and working at the home of the rich but horrid Smythe family. Aside from their uncle (played WONDERFULLY by Charles Sellon), the entire brood are worthless people--and they couldn't care less about sweet Shirley or her mother. However, when Shirley's mother is killed, the uncle INSISTS the child be treated like a member of the family and move out of the servants' quarters. The Smythes can't stand her--but they want the uncle's money and they agree. But what about her guardian, Luke (James Dunn)? He adores the child and can't think of living without her. So what will become of all this? See this nice film and see.A wonderful blend of sentiment and comedy, I can't help but recommend this film. In addition, you'll get to hear Shirley's terrific rendition of Good Ship Lollipop--an amazingly toe-tapping tune. With all the wonderful acting (Dunne, Sellon, Withers and Temple especially), this is the Twentieth Century-Fox formula at its very best. Unless you are even more cynical than me, you will find you can't help but love this film.

The problem is actually far more simple than that, and it's actually a hardware issue in the brain that no amount of therapy nor medication can solve. But, the arrogance of self assuredness, like some of the doctors portrayed in this film, believe otherwise. But, it was the 50s, and bringing this condition to lay audiences who were incredulous and in disbelief. After all, could this really happen? They must have thought this film was out of the realms of science fiction (my forte).The film itself is shot in the usual 1950s style; lots of masters which means the actors have to carry the film with their performances, and no amount of editing will nor can conceal any flaws in the story structure. And the acting is top notch. It's not really overstated, or no more so than American films of the time, but is appropriately near melodramatic during moments of high tension.Nancy Kelley plays the beleaguered mother who slowly discovers the awful truth about her only daughter, played by a very young and talented Patty McCormack. We have a characters who's into psychology played by Evelyn Varden who puts on heirs of knowing how the human mind works, but fails to see anything wrong within the family she serves. The two real experts and the slow handyman who knows more than anyone else played by the magnificent and venerable Henry James (known for tons of TV and film work).Theories are postulated, secrets exposed, evidence discovered. Things happen. And the we the audience are scared.It's estimated that one in four human beings is a psychopath. Which means that every fourth person you meet and interact with, is someone without remorse and incapable of empathy towards others. They are essentially governed by their reptilian instincts which uses high intellect for a vicious survival strategy (to put it in scientific animal speak). Is that what we have in this film? Is our darling little girl really just a human being in form only? You have to see the film to find out.I'll say this about the movie; the play is scarier. It truly is. Things happen in the play that the Hayes code and office obviously frowned on, and the production was no doubt altered for that very reason. So, if you think the film is scary, then you haven't seen anything yet.As per my title, this is a very real scenario, although from the literature I've read female psychopaths are a little more rare than their male counterparts, who tend to be more identifiable with violent or anti-social behavior. Regardless, the film portrays a nightmare for every parent; one that is worse than losing a child.I don't have too much more to say about this film, other than I wouldn't watch it alone if you're squeamish.

The two real experts and the slow handyman who knows more than anyone else played by the magnificent and venerable Henry James (known for tons of TV and film work).Theories are postulated, secrets exposed, evidence discovered. Things happen. And the we the audience are scared.It's estimated that one in four human beings is a psychopath. Which means that every fourth person you meet and interact with, is someone without remorse and incapable of empathy towards others. They are essentially governed by their reptilian instincts which uses high intellect for a vicious survival strategy (to put it in scientific animal speak). Is that what we have in this film? Is our darling little girl really just a human being in form only? You have to see the film to find out.I'll say this about the movie; the play is scarier. It truly is. Things happen in the play that the Hayes code and office obviously frowned on, and the production was no doubt altered for that very reason. So, if you think the film is scary, then you haven't seen anything yet.As per my title, this is a very real scenario, although from the literature I've read female psychopaths are a little more rare than their male counterparts, who tend to be more identifiable with violent or anti-social behavior. Regardless, the film portrays a nightmare for every parent; one that is worse than losing a child.I don't have too much more to say about this film, other than I wouldn't watch it alone if you're squeamish. See it once.

The instructor reassured a very scared class that nothing like this ever happened. I asked someone I knew about such matters if the material in the play actually happened in real life. They assured me it did, and that said instructor was wrong.The Penmark's have almost the ideal daughter. She's perfect in nearly every way, except that she doesn't seem to have a whole lot in common with anyone, and seems fairly self serving. Can a bright little girl with braided pigtails and perfect blonde bangs be a criminal? Is it possible at the tender age of eight?A lot of the comments I've read on the bulletin board regard how the child needed love, not be ignored, or may have been mistreated. The problem is actually far more simple than that, and it's actually a hardware issue in the brain that no amount of therapy nor medication can solve. But, the arrogance of self assuredness, like some of the doctors portrayed in this film, believe otherwise. But, it was the 50s, and bringing this condition to lay audiences who were incredulous and in disbelief. After all, could this really happen? They must have thought this film was out of the realms of science fiction (my forte).The film itself is shot in the usual 1950s style; lots of masters which means the actors have to carry the film with their performances, and no amount of editing will nor can conceal any flaws in the story structure. And the acting is top notch.

It's an action movie with Arnold playing the hero and beating up the bad men who oppress the poor Americans. There is a very clever social satire in there somewhere but it's mostly overshadowed by the action and 80's cheese.As in many 80's action movies, the cast is really good. Arnold is Arnold and does a nice job beating people up and acting all silly. Maria Conchita Alonso plays the obligatory damsel in distress and she has good chemistry with Arnold and does a fine job as always. Richard Dawson pretty much steals the show with his performance as the game show host Killian. Every scene with him was an absolute joy to watch. The rest of the cast mostly consists from character actors you have seen in the 70's, 80's and 90's television and genre movies.The action is creative and offers a lot of interesting scenarios. It's not as over the top as Commando or other Arnold movies but it's more grounded in reality. You get your obligatory chainsaw fights, flamethrowers, gunfights with innocent civilians running around and so on. It's neither very brutal and not that comedic either, the violence is somewhere in the middle like in most of the Arnold movies.Script is serviceable and provides both thrilling action set pieces, cheesy one liners and some social commentary. You could always argue about the fact that the Running Man is a terrible adaptation of a great book but you can't really complain. Just like Total Recall, The Running Man is an Arnold movie with science fiction thrown in for good measure to please the critics. It has some clever moments with the premise and offers some stuff that actually parallels our own but at the end of the day; it's an action movie with Austrian robot pretending to be human. If you have no problem with it, then you might like it just fine. I would love to see a remake that focuses just on the social commentary and media satire aspect because 21st century is the time of reality TV and other crap the pollutes our world. Duncan Jones you have to make this film happen!The Running Man is a must Arnold fare with good supporting performances, memorable one liners and 80's cheese. If you happen to enjoy these silly films and love Arnold, there is no reason why you shouldn't see it. But if you are looking for a serious science fiction movie with loads of media satire and social commentary you will have to settle with the book. There are some clever moments in the film but it's not the focus. Highly recommended for action movie fans.
