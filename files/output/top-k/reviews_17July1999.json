The film takes place over 100 years ago, right at the point of the continental railroad connecting. Jim and his new partner, Artemus Gordon, a master of disguise and invention, are assigned to recover a group of the worlds most intelligent scientists from a madman named General Bloodbath. They try to investigate in two main ways Gordon uses costumes trick Bloodbath, while West uses force.There is another character in the story, however, and his name is Dr. Arliss Loveless, a traitor whose lower half was blown out from underneath him during the recent war. He demands that the United States surrender their freedom to him and his accomplices. So he kills General Bloodbath and uses the scientists that he stole for a brilliant masterpiece war weapon shaped like a giant spider and can blow out fire balls from its mouth.Wild Wild West is so completely filled with problems and obvious flaws that I could not catch all of them in my notes. I'll explain each and every one of them that I caught-but first lets begin with structure The film opens to what seems like a standard three act formula (the kidnapped scientists being the problem, the evil General Bloodbath being the main villain, the two secret agents being the hero). The problem begins about a third way through when the film opens a brand new problem and villain; Dr. Loveless wants to take over the world and West and Gordon must stop him. Great, that sounds O.K, right? Wrong. What ever happened to the kidnapped scientists? Did Loveless let them go? Absolutely not. He is the scum of the universe and we're supposed believe that our villain is going to release his hostages. I think Not. But the audience doesn't know what to believe because the movie just drops the subject like it never existed. Now, this did not have to be such a problem if the filmmakers used the changing of events as a false first act. However, they didn't even attempt to solve the first initial problem. Thus, already we have a major doubt in the production.Second, let's look at the movie's characters Most of the characters used in Wild Wild West are never developed and are operated as plot puppets, not having any mind of their own. But one in particular stands out in my mind as of being a complete waste of acting, the Salma Hayek character, whose name is Rita. First of all, she appears about a third way though the film and is rescued by Gordon. She then severs the propose as a tag along to West and Gordon when we learn that she is an assistant of Dr. Loveless, but later we learn that this is also not true. After Loveless steals her back from the heroes, she disappears from the film completely, never to be seen again until the happy and peachy premise to tell the heroes that she is doing oka y and to wish her luck with life. Lets see, her presence in the movie is to be what?Now, lets take a look at the stupidity of the plot of Wild Wild West, as if I haven't already screwed up any chance of someone desiring to view it, here's some more to straighten my opinion. The horses in the film appear at random for convenience of the characters. The giant robotic fire-breathing spider controlled by Loveless is supposed to make us believe that America will surrender on its knees, but our two heroes take care of this major problem in ten minutes, proving just what little problem it severed. Gordon discovers and invents the theory of flight in what seems like five minutes. The heroes try for ten minutes to try to get a certain magnet off their neck, but for as big a deal that it possesses in the movie, the filmmakers never do show them taking off the obstacle. As long as you can look yourself in the eye, and remember that the hero never dies the first time though, and continue to want to drive all the way to the theater and pay top prices for this junk pile, I'll say that your one opinionated person.Some of the movie does work. For instance, Will Smith and Kevin Kline are wonderful as the title roles, bringing a sometimes funny tone to the film-breathing some life into it.  And Kenneth Branagh as Dr. Loveless, superb and perfect, way over the top resulting in a ideally crafted villain. For a buddy comedy the music isn't all that bad either.This is the second film of Will Smith's opening of the fourth of July weekend and I am sure many people will go see it. Why do audiences fall for filmmakers' scams? It is obvious at the negativity generated from the critics that this film is no good. And by watching the previews someone surely can tell that it is no Oscar worthy material.

He would rather have his audience leave his films with a total sense of astonishment and force it upon them to fill in the gaps with their own interpretations, like an artist of oil paintings or exquisite sculptures.I loved Strangelove, 2001, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, however Eyes Wide Shut left too much of an emptiness within me. The visual film elements are mesmerising, but the dialogue will drive you NUTS. Especially Nicole Kidman, who takes 5 minutes to complete every damn sentence for dramatic effect (partially due to being drunk in the opening party sequence and stoned in another key scene in their bedroom). This film explores a theme of jealousy and it's consequences. Although no actual extra-marital affairs exist in this film, Cruise's character is driven into an all-night journey into the sexual underworld because his wife wanted to be unfaithful to him when the couple was on vacation a year before these present events.Cruise is emotionally devastated and wanders the night alone and then runs into all sorts of weirdos along the way and ends up in a very sinister mansion on Long Island where a cult-like masquerade ball orgy-fest occurs.

A man who makes movies like most other filmmakers around. Independent, free do do anything he likes, the 100 take man... What Stanley Kubrick has always represented to me is power and madness. A perfectionist who is beloved for a trait that any kingdom would crumble under. I've spent many years trying to like his work. I feel like an outsider. For his last film Eyes Wide Shut, I have the opportunity to see one of his pictures in the theater. That's something that has never happened before.Mr. Kubrick has chosen Tom Cruise to lead us this time. A ferociously gifted actor, he seems the natural choice to play Doctor Bill Harford, a man who's wife(a shockingly capable Nicole Kidman) reveals a secret desire for another man one night whiled stoned on marijuana. In a fit of jealous rage, the Doctor hits the streets of New York in search of his long hidden desires and wishes. What he finds startles him. A world of lust that he never really accepted in his private world. It turns him on and threatens his life at the same time. It's also a world he must confront to understand the bond of his marriage. I can sincerely say that this is Kubrick's most low key film ever.Being Cruise's story, we see everything from his angle of discovery and delight. I was amused by his scenes with a hooker (Vinessa Shaw) and a flirtatious hotel employee (Alan Cumming). I enjoyed most of the first half of the film. Sweet, I thought to myself, I finally like a Stanley Kubrick movie!The one thing Kubrick does like no other director is to make his films glide effortlessly. Eyes Wide Shut is probably the most well put together movie of the year. The production design is absolutely flawless. Each location that Cruise finds himself in is another chance to glimpse a well thought out world. The use of colors and film grain make a nice addition to the texture of the piece. Kubrick also prefers a stedicam glide through a scene than to cuts. Amen! The actors are better served with one-take shots instead of the usual chop-chop mentality. Technically, Eyes Wide Shut is a marvel. The best looking Kubrick film out of the bunch.It is around the infamous orgy scene that the seams start popping out of nowhere. The Doctor finds himself sneaking into a ritualistic orgy complete with high priest and absurdly staged sex. It's the scene that climaxes the Doctor's story. Trouble is, when you look down at your watch, the film still has an hour to go. The orgy scene kills the movie on two levels. First being that - forgive me - it blows the film's wad. We get a full glimpse at the depravity and gluttony that the movie hinted at before(for the record, the digitally added figures that were added to cover nudity to avoid the NC-17 do hurt the scene greatly). Second thing is, since we have no idea what this orgy is about, it's hard to feel the danger that the Doctor is supposedly in. The movie works overtime to suggest that this moment has changed the Doctor forever. I never felt that. It came off as more of a goof than a life-threatening situation. And some orgy, about 10 people having sex while 400 look on. I've seen more bodies in heat in a July line outside the Old Country Buffet.Since the film has nowhere to go after this, we get an hour of forced intrigue and bad acting by Sydney Pollack. Now I want to stress that I did understand, get, comprehend Eyes Wide Shut. It has many layers (the critics keep telling me this), and I'm not a true film lover if I cannot appreciate the film on it's deep emotional levels. But I can't. Kubrick's creation is visually dazzling but is far from pure cinematic brilliance. Other directors could take this material and make the same dead-weight film as well. The only thing that separates this from other movies is all the behind-the-scenes action. If Wes Anderson had his actors do 100 takes of a scene, who cares. But when Kubrick does this, IT'S GENIUS! His films are original. They just aren't all that good.Eyes Wide Shut is a cold, distant movie. A film that many will love, but many more will leave the theater wondering what to think. While with powerful moments, the final product is a very languid piece that will serve as the perfect example to what Stanley Kubrick could do with a million feet of celluloid.------------ 5  ","genre":null},{"date":"17 July 1999","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Eyes Wide ShutUnfortunately, I am of the school where Stanley Kubrick is just another director.

Second thing is, since we have no idea what this orgy is about, it's hard to feel the danger that the Doctor is supposedly in. The movie works overtime to suggest that this moment has changed the Doctor forever. I never felt that. It came off as more of a goof than a life-threatening situation. And some orgy, about 10 people having sex while 400 look on. I've seen more bodies in heat in a July line outside the Old Country Buffet.Since the film has nowhere to go after this, we get an hour of forced intrigue and bad acting by Sydney Pollack. Now I want to stress that I did understand, get, comprehend Eyes Wide Shut. It has many layers (the critics keep telling me this), and I'm not a true film lover if I cannot appreciate the film on it's deep emotional levels. But I can't. Kubrick's creation is visually dazzling but is far from pure cinematic brilliance. Other directors could take this material and make the same dead-weight film as well. The only thing that separates this from other movies is all the behind-the-scenes action. If Wes Anderson had his actors do 100 takes of a scene, who cares. But when Kubrick does this, IT'S GENIUS! His films are original. They just aren't all that good.Eyes Wide Shut is a cold, distant movie. A film that many will love, but many more will leave the theater wondering what to think.

A man who makes movies like most other filmmakers around. Independent, free do do anything he likes, the 100 take man... What Stanley Kubrick has always represented to me is power and madness. A perfectionist who is beloved for a trait that any kingdom would crumble under. I've spent many years trying to like his work. I feel like an outsider. For his last film Eyes Wide Shut, I have the opportunity to see one of his pictures in the theater. That's something that has never happened before.Mr. Kubrick has chosen Tom Cruise to lead us this time. A ferociously gifted actor, he seems the natural choice to play Doctor Bill Harford, a man who's wife(a shockingly capable Nicole Kidman) reveals a secret desire for another man one night whiled stoned on marijuana. In a fit of jealous rage, the Doctor hits the streets of New York in search of his long hidden desires and wishes. What he finds startles him. A world of lust that he never really accepted in his private world. It turns him on and threatens his life at the same time. It's also a world he must confront to understand the bond of his marriage. I can sincerely say that this is Kubrick's most low key film ever.Being Cruise's story, we see everything from his angle of discovery and delight. I was amused by his scenes with a hooker (Vinessa Shaw) and a flirtatious hotel employee (Alan Cumming). I enjoyed most of the first half of the film. Sweet, I thought to myself, I finally like a Stanley Kubrick movie!The one thing Kubrick does like no other director is to make his films glide effortlessly. Eyes Wide Shut is probably the most well put together movie of the year. The production design is absolutely flawless. Each location that Cruise finds himself in is another chance to glimpse a well thought out world. The use of colors and film grain make a nice addition to the texture of the piece. Kubrick also prefers a stedicam glide through a scene than to cuts. Amen! The actors are better served with one-take shots instead of the usual chop-chop mentality. Technically, Eyes Wide Shut is a marvel. The best looking Kubrick film out of the bunch.It is around the infamous orgy scene that the seams start popping out of nowhere. The Doctor finds himself sneaking into a ritualistic orgy complete with high priest and absurdly staged sex. It's the scene that climaxes the Doctor's story. Trouble is, when you look down at your watch, the film still has an hour to go. The orgy scene kills the movie on two levels. First being that - forgive me - it blows the film's wad.

Normally, I see them as window dressing--especially with actresses.  But with this particular movie, the actors are vital.  A major fault with the movie is Tom and Nicole's inability to be a convincing couple.  With EWS, Bill's not-so-wild escapades are supposed to be motivated by the infliction of jealousy by his wife and various sequences of events, but the relationship between Tom and Nicole made it impossibly silly to imagine how Alice could put Bill in such a state.  Flashing back to black and white soft core between Nicole and some naval officer isn't enough.  After all, there are tons of infidelities going around in today's society, and you don't see men crashing orgies for it, let alone crashing one just because of the idea of infidelity.It wasn't the script's fault, though.  Kidman's lines emphasize her willingness to throw away a 9 year relationship for a fling as well as her inability to see her husband as a masculine and sexual being.  I believe that was suposed to be a significant point of revelation for Bill.  But there was nothing in Nicole's delivery of her lines to make me believe how dire and dreadful a point she was making, nor was there any good acting on Tom's part to make me believe that suddenly his whole concept of what kind of relationship he had (not to mention his concept of what a married couple is) suddenly shattered.  But if you listen to the lines carefully, you can see it's there.  Not just the lines, but the sequence of events that lead Cruise's character through his strange odyssey.  (Like the ridicule of Tom's sexuality by those boys who tell him to go back to San Francisco where he belongs.)This was undoubtedly a terrific piece, and I'm not saying this to praise one of my favortie directors. Visually, it's gorgeous--very flawless.  There's a good sense of balance, too (except towards the end, maybe).  However, because of Tom and Nicole, I don't believe many people will realize how good it actually is.  Without knowing Bill's motivations the movie is pointless because like most Kubrick pieces the film isn't so much plot driven but character\/psychology\/action driven.  Try to ignore their performances and just listen to the words as written by Kubrick and pay attention to little details.

No need, no need! This film IS a Kubrick film, without any doubt, and as all Kubrick films are it was absolutely stunning. Absolutely. Visually it is brilliant, though I should warn that this isn't quite as visual a film as most other Kubrick works. A lot of the film focuses on the characters, on human interaction, something rather new to this director. Of course, all the Kubrick trademarks are there, cold analytical gazes, sharp introspection. Tom Cruise seems like Jack Nicholson in 'The Shining' and even Malcolm MacDowell in 'A Clockwork Orange' at times, a rather striking fact considering that this is Tom Cruise. The performances were excellent all around, even from places not expected. Again, this is typical for Kubrick. He wasn't much of a people director, but he still knew how to direct people.Almost every moment of this film was flawless, perfect and pristine. The dialog is predictable, but in some solemn and holy fateful sort of way, as though the words and the moments are matched so essentially that nothing else could possibly fit. Beyond that the sounds and images all fit together beautifully, creating an almost unblemished whole. The only part that didn't seem right was the sequence that had been digitally altered. While the alterations were not nearly so obtrusive as I had feared (not knowing about them one probably wouldn't notice them) they do grow a bit noticeable for redundancy (you see a lot more backs than you'd expect, and always in the same places). Unfortunately these came right in the middle of one of the most visually amazing pieces of the film (one of the most amazing pieces of cinema as a whole, in my opinion), a very unwelcome distraction.Is this movie about sex? Yes, it is, but more importantly it is about people. The sex part is simply a product thereof. This is one of the most disturbingly honest portraits of human behavior and motivations ever made. The most honest I've ever seen, at least. To be put simply It is about sex because people are about sex.I'm still trying to sort through this movie. It's been a good twelve hours since I saw it, and I can still feel it, hard and definite, rotating in my stomach. The film itself seems mostly void of opinion (not entirely, but mostly), serving more as a general statement and commentary than any specific moral warning, but the questions it inspires are very strong indeed.

The film's final word sums it (it being the film and humanity) up pretty well, for better or for worse.

He's shown us violence and madness and everything else, all tracking the path back to the dawn of man.

The scenes at the masked ball ritual and orgy reek with menace, before and after Bill's exposure before the wealthy degenerates -especially when they threaten him and his family. Their diabolical threats are seemingly underlined in the utterly chilling scene where Bill enters his bedroom after the ball....Yet the film as a whole is oddly disappointing. It contains so many unresolved elements, such as the costume shop owner and his daughter's apparently promiscuous conduct. Is she really his daughter? Why does her father act as the outraged father when he finds her with two men during the night, yet as an ingratiating pimp the next morning? Does the luckless pianist Nick survive the degenerates' wrath after telling Bill about the time and venue of the  orgy? Is Bill's evil millionaire friend (well played by Sidney Pollock) telling the truth about Nick and the deceased party girl? Why does Bill react in such a bizarre manner to his adored wife's honest confessions of sexual fantasies - NOT physical infidelities?

","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"17 July 1999","score":"","review":"  Eyes Wide Shut is an lengthy exploration of the marriage of two affluent New Yorkers. Alice and Bill have a beautiful apartment, a lovely 7 year old daughter, a Range Rover, pots of money, they are portrayed by Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise...yet something is lacking. Just as there are several things lacking in this meticulously constructed movie.She confesses to a powerful infatuation with a naval officer (but they do not have sex).  She dances in a very flirtatious manner with a older, handsome Hungarian at a lavish party in a millionaire  friend's home (but they do not have sex).At the same party Bill goes off arm-in-arm with two models (but they do not have sex). He embarks on a weird journey around New York. The daughter of a just-deceased patient kisses him in the same room where her dead pa is lying in bed (but they do not have sex). He goes to a hooker's decrepit apartment and pays her $150 (but they do not have sex). At considerable expense and trouble, Bill then goes to an very exclusive orgy at a magnificent out-of-town mansion (where everyone but he has sex). If this is not proof that doctors are grossly overpaid, I do not know what is.As George Bernard Shaw said about the institution of marriage, Bill's horribly expensive trip combines the maximum of temptation with the maximum of opportunity. Yet he is either too scared or too faithful to his wife (who is far more gorgeous than any of his potential illicit sexual partners) to take advantage of any of the chances laid before him. He constantly flies close the flame, but does not quite get burnt.The film is obviously ambitious in so many ways its meticulous recreation of New York within an English studio, the lavish sets, the impeccable performances from the entire cast, its superlative craftmanship. I particularly appreciated the SOUND...the ticking of the clock in the dead patient's bedroom, the thump of the wooden staff on the floor during the quasi-religious ritual before the orgy. Stanley Kubrick elicits the most intense and moving performance I have ever seen from Tom Cruise. Admittedly, this is like talking about the hottest day ever in Finland, but praise where praise is due.The story becomes progressively more enthralling, if you can tolerate its 2.5+ hours of plot development. The scenes at the masked ball ritual and orgy reek with menace, before and after Bill's exposure before the wealthy degenerates -especially when they threaten him and his family. Their diabolical threats are seemingly underlined in the utterly chilling scene where Bill enters his bedroom after the ball....Yet the film as a whole is oddly disappointing. It contains so many unresolved elements, such as the costume shop owner and his daughter's apparently promiscuous conduct. Is she really his daughter? Why does her father act as the outraged father when he finds her with two men during the night, yet as an ingratiating pimp the next morning? Does the luckless pianist Nick survive the degenerates' wrath after telling Bill about the time and venue of the  orgy? Is Bill's evil millionaire friend (well played by Sidney Pollock) telling the truth about Nick and the deceased party girl? Why does Bill react in such a bizarre manner to his adored wife's honest confessions of sexual fantasies - NOT physical infidelities? The atheist Kubrick seems to be adopting the Biblical principle that to look at a woman (or man) lustfully is the same as actual fornication.Possibly, as one reviewer suggested, Alice is merely inflaming the rather dull Bill's sexual imagination, rather than his jealousy. In which case, why not indulge his libido with his beautiful, loving, faithful and lawfully wedded spouse? For a guy bright enough to be a successful doctor, he is too dumb to recognise a good thing under his own nose.If these loose ends were present in a film by any other director, they would be criticised as sloppiness. As it is the late great Kubrick, we are supposedly expected to regard them as profound or enigmatic. It is all the more disappointing in view of the extraordinary length of the project's creation...the longest film shoot in history, talk of 100 takes for every scene. If a fraction of that time and effort had gone into a more coherent screenplay, I am sure the end result would have been more satisfactory.It is worthwhile correcting some of the crazier rumours which circulated before the film's release. Bill and Alice are respectively an ordinary doctor and an ex-art gallery manager - NOT psychiatrists\/sexologists. Tom Cruise does NOT wear a blue dress...pity, it might have enlivened the stodgier early half of the movie.After seeing most of Kubrick's films, I remember them as an indispensable part of my film education and the best times I have spent in cinemas.

While some were better than others, each one surprised with its unconventional storytelling, and usually with innovative visuals that stay with the viewer long after leaving the theater. Most Kubrick films are adapted from novels, but Kubrick felt quite free to vastly alter the original story for his own purposes. Films like Lolita and A Clockwork Orange use intriguing imagery to give physicality to books which have more to do with the workings of the protagonist's mind than his interaction with his surroundings.How strange, then, that Kubrick would adapt Traumnovelle, a story that takes place almost completely inside the protagonist's head, and that the adaptation would be so literal...setting aside, of course, the fact that Eyes Wide Shut takes place a century later than the novel. Bill Hareford (Tom Cruise) is clearly growing more and more obsessed about both his wife's sexual fantasies and a world full of sexual practices foreign -and inexplicable- to him. And yet, excepting black and white hallucinations of his wife with another man, his obsession, his confusion, is mostly implied, his specific thoughts and theories mostly left for us to be guessed at. And that's irritating, not just because we as an audience want to understand the character we're watching, but also because Kubrick has such a reputation for inventive dialog and imagery that simultaneously entertains and advances the story, while also giving us insight into what the characters are thinking. Of course, very often, as in 2001 or Lolita or Full Metal Jacket, not much context is required to understand the thoughts and motivations of any given character they are driven by lust, survival, fear. But its harder to tell what Bill Hareford is driven by. Why does he go to the costume party? In the novel, it's a way of dealing with his growing irritation that perhaps he isn't as suave and cosmopolitan as he thought. In the movie, it's less clear. In the hands of a master storyteller like Kubrick, ambiguity can be quite appropriate, but in this film there is too much of it, or it's in the wrong places, or something. All I can say now, less than twenty-four hours after viewing the film, that the placement of ambiguity often felt intuitively wrong to me.The scenery is colorful and well-lit, the costumes are chic, the acting is good, and there are plenty of attractive naked women to look at, but with one notable exception - the already-famous costume party ordeal in the middle of the film - there is little here that is going to stick in my mind for very long. And...how...slow...Nicole...Kidman...talked....I...realize...it...was...on.. .purpose...but...it...got...old.What was so great about these scenes that they had to be filmed over so many times? And the hubub about the sexiness of the film is really misplaced...there have been much bolder, sexier, more shocking movies, many of them with an R rating.

Another highlight was Alan Cumming, who provided a much-needed wake-up and comic relief as the hotel clerk.  But these were not enough to save the film.I suppose that we should all play nice and rave about EWS, seeing as the master filmmaker died just after its completion.  And I suppose that we should also go along with some fawning critics and claim this is a wonderful film, worthy of praise alongside truly amazing Kubrick films like 2001 and Dr Strangelove, because, after all, it's his last film.  We should, I suppose, also ignore  Nicole Kidman's weak performance (her pot smoking scene was laughable, and performance generally shallow), Tom Cruise's overwrought emotional performance (which was, barring the often senseless crying and whining, nicely done), a piano soundtrack that threatens to cause insanity, and a totally inadequate and weak end scene.

However, to fans like myself who have enjoyed Kubrick's work in the past, and had high expectations for this film, it's a disappointment.

What director can boast of such a wide variety of films and styles while maintaining such a high level of work?  Few, and Kubrick was one of them.  The man was a filmmaking genius.  No one can argue that point.  However, we CAN argue the merits of individual films within a lifetime of work, and EWS would have to rank as a major disappointment when measured against Kubrick's past achievements.The film was beautiful visually.  Kubrick certainly had his own vision, as every good director does, and his fans certainly won't be disappointed from this perspective.  As far as the craft of making films goes, EWS was often fantastic.  However, the actual story drags in places, which isn't good for such a long film.  In fact it was so much so that I heard some of the 30 or so patrons in the theater begin to make comments to the screen about it. Some movies are meant to be interactive, with cheering and such, but when a film generates only get on with it! and lots of sheeshes, it's not a good thing.Sydney Pollack was extremely solid in his role.  Nicole Kidman's rear end did a fine job.  And the whole scene of the orgy party was very well done. Another highlight was Alan Cumming, who provided a much-needed wake-up and comic relief as the hotel clerk.  But these were not enough to save the film.I suppose that we should all play nice and rave about EWS, seeing as the master filmmaker died just after its completion.  And I suppose that we should also go along with some fawning critics and claim this is a wonderful film, worthy of praise alongside truly amazing Kubrick films like 2001 and Dr Strangelove, because, after all, it's his last film.  We should, I suppose, also ignore  Nicole Kidman's weak performance (her pot smoking scene was laughable, and performance generally shallow), Tom Cruise's overwrought emotional performance (which was, barring the often senseless crying and whining, nicely done), a piano soundtrack that threatens to cause insanity, and a totally inadequate and weak end scene.  Why?  Well, it was Kubrick's last film, of course.Baloney.  The truth is, unless you're serious Kubrick fan, or a die-hard Kidman or Cruise fan, you're bound to be disappointed.  Like mystery?  It's here only as a misleading force.  Like romance?  Look elsewhere.  Want drama?  There's some, but it's fairly bland stuff.  EWS takes on many angles and delivers on precious few of them.  True, it's nice to have someone take a mature look at sex and relationships, and to do it intelligently and seriously.  Intelligent films are a good thing, when done right.  There are elements of genius in this film, but it simply doesn't come together in a way that relieves the boring stretches and overshadows the weak performances and ending.I can't imagine that this film is going to be a favorite among the general movie-going public.

Amidala's costumes are meticulously designed with much Japanese influence.6. Spectacular lightsaber fighting scenes. On the desert, in the hangar and the last one. Specially the last one. I think Lucas and his team want the best battle choreography done as the climax. When American audience has been exposed to fast-paced Asian action movies (Hongkong and Japanese anime), they have to increase the standard of this fighting scene to cope with the audience demands. And they did.7. Not all things are explained which make me impatient to wait for the next episode. Lots of loose ends need to be tied here. Hopefully they are meant to be that way and not because of some fault in the narration.8. Lots of 'delights' planted in the movie.

You have QuiGon to represent the old generation\/the mentor, OB1 to present the young adult, and young Anakin for the kids to relate to.10. John Williams is back as the composer for the soundtrack. My personal fav. is the last lightsaber-fight's background music. Nice job there Mr. Williams.And now the 10 BAD things about this movie which, surprisingly spoken not by the press or non sci-fi fan, but myself and other long-time Starwars fans 1. Jar Jar Binks & Boss Nass. If Lucas needed to introduce the element of comedy, he should've done it through intelligent comical dialogue (just like what he did with Luke, Han and Leia), not some low grade physical slapsticks (I hate the way JarJar jumps into the water).2. Target audience. Obviously Lucas directed this movie towards the 6 to 13 year old kids instead of his true long-time fans, who are mostly aged 20 to 40 by now. Perhaps this is also because of the fact of him being a father. We all can use the humour, but to what level exactly? The children seem to be the ones truly enjoying the entire movie.3. Plot is too shallow. The media say,So are the rest of the episodes' plots. No. The original trilogy were conceived through careful and detailed narration. This was done by having the right chemistry between the characters and the dialogue are meaningful and entertaining. Unfortunately I can't say the same thing for TPM.4. In connection with opinion #3, the entire movie seems like a series of pacthes of many beautiful and strong scenes. Perhaps the movie is too short, that we are not given enough time to know what is really going on. Or because it's really too simple while we're still thinking if that action really means something.5. The effects and climaxes overwhelm the characterizations. Too many good things fighting each other. The CG creatures are too perfect, too smooth that you know how fake they are. When the Ewoks die in ROJ, I actually feel sorry for those 'little teddy bears' but in TPM I don't care much what happens to those 'overgrown ducks'.6. Racism in context of personalization. I know Lucas is merely trying to entertain the kids but isn't he mentally suggesting to the kids, how silly the Jamaican Jar Jar Binks is, how simple-minded the Italian Boss Nass is, how evil the Japanese Viceroys are, and how greedy the-whatever-non-American-Watto is?7. Anakin is too young. The original script was meant to have a 10 year old Anakin, but the genius Lucas thinks it would be more touching to have an 8 year old  to go through all the obstacles. Well, because of this there are odd moments when Anakin interacts which other characters, especially the sexual implication between him and Amidala\/Padme.8. I dislike how Anakin destroys the Droid Control Ship. It looks more like luck than the force. Oops, push this button (there goes the power generator), push this button (the battle (droids are destroyed).9. The movie seems like a lab-rat to test ILM's new technology. The CG characters truly lack of emotion. The mimics are all there but not the emotions, not the souls. Lucas is better go back to actors wearing costumes and masks.10. The chemistry between the characters (except for QuiGon and OB1) is lost in the midst of all the excitements.I can only hope all of our disappointments and opinions do not fall on deaf ears, and that Lucas may have the remedy in the next chapters. So next time, I will be able to write 20 good things about Episode II with 0 bad things.Thank you.

Perhaps this is also because of the fact of him being a father. We all can use the humour, but to what level exactly? The children seem to be the ones truly enjoying the entire movie.3. Plot is too shallow. The media say,So are the rest of the episodes' plots. No. The original trilogy were conceived through careful and detailed narration. This was done by having the right chemistry between the characters and the dialogue are meaningful and entertaining. Unfortunately I can't say the same thing for TPM.4. In connection with opinion #3, the entire movie seems like a series of pacthes of many beautiful and strong scenes. Perhaps the movie is too short, that we are not given enough time to know what is really going on. Or because it's really too simple while we're still thinking if that action really means something.5. The effects and climaxes overwhelm the characterizations. Too many good things fighting each other. The CG creatures are too perfect, too smooth that you know how fake they are. When the Ewoks die in ROJ, I actually feel sorry for those 'little teddy bears' but in TPM I don't care much what happens to those 'overgrown ducks'.6. Racism in context of personalization. I know Lucas is merely trying to entertain the kids but isn't he mentally suggesting to the kids, how silly the Jamaican Jar Jar Binks is, how simple-minded the Italian Boss Nass is, how evil the Japanese Viceroys are, and how greedy the-whatever-non-American-Watto is?7. Anakin is too young. The original script was meant to have a 10 year old Anakin, but the genius Lucas thinks it would be more touching to have an 8 year old  to go through all the obstacles. Well, because of this there are odd moments when Anakin interacts which other characters, especially the sexual implication between him and Amidala\/Padme.8. I dislike how Anakin destroys the Droid Control Ship. It looks more like luck than the force. Oops, push this button (there goes the power generator), push this button (the battle (droids are destroyed).9. The movie seems like a lab-rat to test ILM's new technology. The CG characters truly lack of emotion. The mimics are all there but not the emotions, not the souls. Lucas is better go back to actors wearing costumes and masks.10. The chemistry between the characters (except for QuiGon and OB1) is lost in the midst of all the excitements.I can only hope all of our disappointments and opinions do not fall on deaf ears, and that Lucas may have the remedy in the next chapters. So next time, I will be able to write 20 good things about Episode II with 0 bad things.Thank you.

I'm a fan. But I have a mixed feelings and opinion regarding Episode 1, which best described by these points.10 GOOD THINGS  1. Great effects. Lucas has managed to paint the StarWars worlds closer to his imagination with ILM technology. The Naboo palaces are elegant, beautiful Gungan city, hi-tech Coruscant and well-designed Battle Droids.2. Professional actors and actresses. It's amazing to see some of the heavy-caliber actors\/actresses and hot newcomers casted in the movie. Ewan is a perfect substitution for Alec Guinness, Liam has the charisma and posture meant for a Qui-Gon, Natalie's characterization has strength plus she has this intellect and sweetness in her image, etc.3. Loyalty to the original trilogy. You can finally see how the Jedi (and the rest of the galaxy) are (were) like before the Empire rules. They are more liveful, energetic and colorful. All this without the expense of the Jedi tradition. You can see how the designs of settings, costumes and vehicles (although they seem to be more advance) will later contribute to the designs in the original trilogy.4. I welcome the cameo appearance of some of the original cast. A. Daniels as 3PO, K. Baker as R2, Ian McDarmid's Palpatine, even Warwick Davis is there.5. Great costumes. The Jedi cape has distinctive personality according to the one who wears it, without eliminating the uniformity of which is clearly Alec Guinness' OB1's costume. Amidala's costumes are meticulously designed with much Japanese influence.6. Spectacular lightsaber fighting scenes. On the desert, in the hangar and the last one. Specially the last one. I think Lucas and his team want the best battle choreography done as the climax. When American audience has been exposed to fast-paced Asian action movies (Hongkong and Japanese anime), they have to increase the standard of this fighting scene to cope with the audience demands. And they did.7. Not all things are explained which make me impatient to wait for the next episode. Lots of loose ends need to be tied here. Hopefully they are meant to be that way and not because of some fault in the narration.8. Lots of 'delights' planted in the movie. Some for fun, while others I believe actually connected to the rest of the episodes. Try to find out, there are at least 6 'secrets' in the movie.9. A complete family set. You have QuiGon to represent the old generation\/the mentor, OB1 to present the young adult, and young Anakin for the kids to relate to.10. John Williams is back as the composer for the soundtrack. My personal fav. is the last lightsaber-fight's background music. Nice job there Mr. Williams.And now the 10 BAD things about this movie which, surprisingly spoken not by the press or non sci-fi fan, but myself and other long-time Starwars fans 1. Jar Jar Binks & Boss Nass. If Lucas needed to introduce the element of comedy, he should've done it through intelligent comical dialogue (just like what he did with Luke, Han and Leia), not some low grade physical slapsticks (I hate the way JarJar jumps into the water).2.

Liam Neeson does his best and is the sole highlight of the film, Nathalie Portman was nice, the rest - blah... Especially Ewan McGregor had basically nothing to do, Samuel L.

It seems that what we learned in school, news, and other sorts of media, would try to make war very patriotic.  A Thin Red Line shows what many textbooks and propaganda seem to hide The real horrors of war. I can see how many viewers may find Line very dry.  This movie was full of symbolism that may have been hard to grasp.  I believe that the only main character, Pvt. Witt, made the point of the movie clear.  Pvt.

At his death, he grasps all things he still possesses that will bring him to peace; which is ironically what he wished for in the beginning of the movie to die with calm like my mom.

I do agree that there were some things that weren't clear in the movie as well as some muffled voices.  Yet this movie stands strong.  This movie brings back soldiers from the dead, to give them back their character, their dreams, their hopes and fears. The film's foundation is to comprehend the deep and emotional battle within these soldiers in order to bring some hope and truth within the meaning of life.
