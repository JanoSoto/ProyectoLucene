[{"date":"22 March 2001","score":"6 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":"  The first word that comes to mind with this movie is BORING. Truly boring! And pathetically disappointing! I have seen hundreds and hundreds of movies over the years, and some very very funny comedies, but this one?? Where do I start? Not one scene made me laugh or even smile...not one! I am glad to see that I am not the only one here who can agree. Like some users have said This has got to be one of the most overrated movies of the 90's. And I agree with the user who said that this is one of those movies it's cool to say you like.So, so true! Every now and then, movies come out that become trendy and 'everyone has to see it'. Then, as it receives much hype in press and media, I seriously believe many people are afraid to be 'different', and so they choose to say that they too thought it was good even though they keep their true opinion to themselves. (other examples of this phenomenon are SkinDeep, Dumb and Dumber and Shakespeare in Love - all among the worst movies I have ever paid to see).And by the way, in no way did I think this movie was 'disgusting' or 'gross'. No, it was just plain UNFUNNY and so bad that I truly question what modern comedy-making has come to. Look at Scary Movie as well.....yet another modern movie that's supposed to be funny, but is one of the worst alleged 'comedies' I have ever seen.If you wanna see a *good* example of a comedy that manages to actually use sexual jokes and crudity on a TRULY FUNNY level, go see Ford Fairlane.If you wanna see *good* examples of movies that can be BOTH 'gross' (and actually can be called gross) AND funny - go see Dead Alive, Army of Darkness or Evil Dead III am embarrassed on behalf of the people who made this movie and I will from now on stay away from anything they make. Granted, KingPin was good, but Dumb and Dumber was also highly overrated and really bad.

It was a big-screen adaption of a classic children's story (and an equally classic cartoon by Chuck Jones) modeled after...who else, but the Grinch!  With Jim Carrey as the title character, I knew I had to see this one.  He, and director Ron Howard, I could tell, where going to bring it to life!  So, along came November, 2000.  I was there to see this movie on its opening night (I often like to) and this turned out to be a very funny movie.  It contained a true-to-the-book style story, and I, at some point, forgot this was Jim Carrey playing the Grinch.  He just belonged in this movie.  The supporting cast is fun to watch, and Cindy-Lou Who gets more screen time than she did in the book and cartoon.  But don't worry, the Grinch is still the leading character.  Dr. Seuss would more than likely be satisfied.  It was easy to see why this movie became the highest grossing movie of 2000.  If another Dr. Seuss book was made into a movie, which one do you think they would they do next, maybe a live-action Cat in the Hat?  GROSS-OUT ALERT!!! If you enjoyed your lunch, you should turn away for this one scene.  In the remix of, You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch, remember the lyrics, you've got termites in your smile?  Well, then, Mr. Grinch decides to show us they're not kidding...
