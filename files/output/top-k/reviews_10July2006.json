[{"date":"10 July 2006","score":"","review":" Shrek tells the story of a hideous ogre who lives in a swamp, happy to be alone. When the evil Lord Farquaad evicts all the fairy tale creatures (including Pinocchio and the 3 Little Pigs) from his land, they go to Shrek's swamp. Lord Farquaad tells Shrek that he'll remove the creatures if he can defeat a dragon and rescue a stranded princess. Shrek sets out with a talking Donkey to rescue the princess, but ends up in a series of misadventures. Shrek is a great movie because it appeals to both kids and adults.Shrek attracts children because it has a bevy of fairy tale characters that they will recognize including everybody from the 3 blind mice to the Big Bad Wolf. All of these characters in one film will surely keep your child happy. It appeals to adults because some of the humour is adult oriented, but it is just over your child's head, so you don't have to worry. Also, the movie has a fairly good story, so it's not one of those preachy kids' movies.The voice talent is very talented here. Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy are hilarious together, and John Lithgow doesn't need his face and body to be on screen for his great acting to show through.Overall, this is a great movie that adults and kids can enjoy together.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"10 July 2006","score":"","review":" Shrek tells the story of a hideous ogre who lives in a swamp, happy to be alone.
