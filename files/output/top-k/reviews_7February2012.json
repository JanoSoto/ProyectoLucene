[{"date":"7 February 2012","score":"","review":" Came late to the game on this one and only watched it a few days ago but cant believe i missed it! I loved everything about this and not because im a girl and im supposed to but because the films has aged so well thanks to the strength of the central performances. I also really loved the way the dancing really brought the characters together in a strong yet vibrant way. it seems crazy to me that the film is as old as it is as it feels so un dated. Once again i really enjoyed the film and will be looking out for more films with these two in as they both gave a really great performance! Overall i would give the film an eight out of ten as some of the dialogue is fairly clunky but pretty good score!
