DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE)Being an avid reader of Philip K Dick, and having seen all of the movies that were adapted from his stories and novels, I didn't know what I would think of Minority Report.  But I must say that I was absolutely enthralled with the movie.  Through solid acting, unbelievable(yet subtle) special effects, and an incredible adapted story, the words from the pages of Dick's story were brought to life.  It was nice to see a movie that expanded the short story, yet did not stray too far off-tangent from the original framework the story formed.I will be the first to admit, I never really liked Tom Cruise's acting.  I always thought he seemed to stuck on himself to concentrate on what he was paid to do...act.  But he was incredible in Minority Report.  His portrayal of John Anderton as a human being, rather than a supercop that could take on hundreds of armed men with only his bare hands(like so many heroes in action films today), Cruise made his character believable.  I felt his joys and his pains.  As he was running away from his former colleagues, I found myself cheering him on, hoping that he wouldn't get caught.  While suffering with drug addiction over the loss of his son before the days of Pre-Crime, Anderton rose through the ranks to become the director of the organization in his personal struggle to make sure what happened to him wouldn't happen to anybody else.  This is Tom Cruise at his finest.I was also just as impressed with Samantha Morton's role as Agatha. Although she did not have much dialogue, her facial expressions conveyed more than words ever could.  She was able to use her facial expressions to portray a sense of innocence while simultaneously commanding authority. (SPOILER!) This was particularly apparent in the scene where she helps Cruise's character escape the police in the mall scene by using the balloon vendor.As I mentioned earlier, the special effects were incredible, but yet they did not draw your attention away from the real focus of the movie...the story.  Unlike this summer's other blockbuster movies, the CGI was not thrown in your face.  To borrow from Roger Ebert, director Steven Speilberg has always used the technology of special effects to weave into his movies, rather than using sfx and CGI to make movies FROM like so many directors do.The entire movie was a montage of eye-candy.  Never have I seen a futuristic world look so believable and realistic.  From the billboards that call to you by name(I actually got a real kick from those) to the newspapers that updated themselves with breaking news stories, it all seems quite possible 50 years from now.  Perhaps I may live to see these in use someday.The film's story was incredible.  Although Minority Report was based on PKD's short story, the film's screenplay stood out on its own as a new idea. The basic framework was in place, but the screenwriters added so many new ideas that the two almost stand alone, as separate interpretations of the same idea.Lastly, I walked out of the theater asking myself various questions of morality, which PKD excelled at making his readers ask themselves.  Is it right to try and change the inevitable(arresting criminals before they commit a crime?)  Does attempting to change the really help a person cope with a personal demon by preventing it from happening to anyone else.  From the intense action scene at the beginning of the movie to the final whodunnit conclusion at the film's second half, Minority Report is the essence of what PKD would have wanted to see in an adaptation of his story.

The story of John Nash is no doubt a difficult story to tackle, after all he developed the Game Theory of economics which I read about & which gave me headaches for weeks after. Representing that in the film in any sort of depth would be very hard to do without alienating a vast population of cinema goers, although complex mathematical problems have been represented in an understandable & entertaining way before (most notably with the efforts of British code breakers & cracking the Nazi Enigma cyphers).Here's the dilemma then, as Russell Crowe's mumbling Nash descends into delusions the story is interesting. Ed Harris is spooky as the Big Brother character called Parcher, who works in a world of spies & espionage. The slide from reality to unreality is very well done, you really can't tell that Nash has slipped his leash & wandered off into increasingly paranoid delusions unless you know the story already. From then on it's an occasionaly fast paced plot about breaking Russian codes, tracking suitcased sized atomic bombs that are being routed across the US by a radical faction of the Soviet military. All very James Bond & there's plenty to keep you glued to the screen.The reality takes a back seat, to the extent that you wonder just what on earth the world was doing to allow Nash to keep working in his lofty position while all this hallucination was going on. Now I can understand that you only have so much time, so much story line to devote & that avenues are explored at the expense of others, but if you don't know what John Nash's accomplishments were (his Game Theory revolutionised economics) then you spend the rest of the film confused. Although his new theory is mentioned, a result of his university search for a completely original area of maths, only at the end is a passing reference made to the importance of his breakthrough. In fact I know some people who think that his unequaled contribution to the world & the reason why he was in such a good job, was the breaking of the above mentioned Soviet codes! This is an indication of how confusing the story can be & I know that it needs to be shown that Nash was delusional, but not at the risk of having the audience lose the plot!All this is due to the overstating of his delusional world, which is cleverly done, but there's far too much smoke & mirrors for the real story to emerge. For instance it is well into the second half of the film that you find out that his college room mate Charles (Paul Bettanay) is actually an illusion. This is skillfully done, it has to be said (the scene in Dr Rosen's (Christopher Plummer) office), but by then you have to sit & think far too much about dominant plot lines that have happened before. I'm all for films making you think, rather than the force fed cotton candy rubbish of Spielberg or Brockheimer, but I found the phase change too confusing. There really should have been a few more clues to build suspicion in the viewing public's mind.There are some hints. For instance there are several characters that never interact with the real world. They also never age, a vital point to Nash's eventual recognition of his illness & the way in which he managed to live with it. But it's far too subtle, to the point where the hints fade into obscurity & the importance is lost.Of course you go, Ooohhh' & Aaahhhh when the truth is revealed, but then we have the second problem, we're back to dry reality & nothing interesting happens. It becomes a life struggle, a unique story non the less, as I don't know how many people have overcome their paranoid delusions simply by applying their on intelect. But rapidly it settles into well worn tracks that are dusted off yet again. Triumph over adversity, love conquers all, the value of friendship, blah blah blah. Iwas left thinking that having Parcher around was better!A final criticism revolves around the sound. Many years ago when Al Pacino & Robert Deniro came along we had a terrible series of mumbling films, where you couldn't hear what on earth people were saying. This film is bordering on the same, with one minute explosions of sound, followed by long periods of what did he say????. With modern sound production techniques there really is no excuse.Visually it is absolutely flawless, the cinematography flows without effort & the eye is constantly at ease with what is being shown. I like that, it's the way it should be. The music is well sorted out too, setting the mood very well without being obtrusive. This isn't a high octane thriller, so we're treated to a background sound track that stays there, adding to the flavour perfectly.The actors are also wonderful, although Russel Crowe mumbles far too much, as I said. Ed Harris is teriffic as the government spook, Parcher, fitting the 1950s suit & hat with a combination of attention holding aura & chilling malice. Jennifer Connelly is the long suffering wife, a part that doesn't give her much room for development, but she gets to flesh the part out as much as she can (like I said, some aspects of Nash's life get trimmed as the delusional world takes up so much time). Christopher Plummer as the psychiatrist Dr Rosen is a little disturbing, the line where he forciably takes Nash into hospital is somethign like I just want to talk with you, which you know means he's going to actually lock him up. None the less it's good to see Plummer still getting work & doing it very well indeed.One final point surrounds Nash's sexual preferences. I've heard from several gay that Nash went both ways, with a preference for men & that this wasn't shown. I've no idea how true this is, but if it is the case I don't think it's very fair to leave this out. After all if it's OK to have the subject of severe mental illness raised, why not his sexual orientation? Others, those who are more informed ont he subject, will have to explore that avenue.

This isn't a high octane thriller, so we're treated to a background sound track that stays there, adding to the flavour perfectly.The actors are also wonderful, although Russel Crowe mumbles far too much, as I said. Ed Harris is teriffic as the government spook, Parcher, fitting the 1950s suit & hat with a combination of attention holding aura & chilling malice. Jennifer Connelly is the long suffering wife, a part that doesn't give her much room for development, but she gets to flesh the part out as much as she can (like I said, some aspects of Nash's life get trimmed as the delusional world takes up so much time). Christopher Plummer as the psychiatrist Dr Rosen is a little disturbing, the line where he forciably takes Nash into hospital is somethign like I just want to talk with you, which you know means he's going to actually lock him up. None the less it's good to see Plummer still getting work & doing it very well indeed.One final point surrounds Nash's sexual preferences. I've heard from several gay that Nash went both ways, with a preference for men & that this wasn't shown. I've no idea how true this is, but if it is the case I don't think it's very fair to leave this out. After all if it's OK to have the subject of severe mental illness raised, why not his sexual orientation? Others, those who are more informed ont he subject, will have to explore that avenue.

I'm not sure the movie would work without the great, haughty, fierce, indomitable, unforgettable Isabelle Huppert.  Often Huppert has been cold and cruel and elegant and desirable, but never has she been so sick and twisted as here, and she goes the limit.  There is no more fearless and confident actress in movie history and none I'd go so out of my way to watch. I gritted my teeth and entered the theater expecting no fun.  The opening credits won me over, though.  The way the sound ends when the names come on, between each vignette, show an ability to make you take notice, to make the routine fresh.  Each vignette is different; in each Erika Kohut, the piano teacher (Huppert) is cruel to another piano student in a different way. I could see something compulsively watchable coming. When the razor-in-the-bathroom scene came, I looked away  I'd been warned. Then I peeked it wasn't so bad.  Most of all, it was swift and methodical; she's as dispassionately cruel toward herself as she is toward others.  It's a job to get done in time for dinner  mom's calling.Besides Huppert, the young actor who plays Walter Klemmer (Benoît Magimel) is remarkable.  Like his character, he appears ordinary, good but not great looking, too confident, boringly relaxed, but he surprises you by keeping up with Huppert every step of the way just as his character does.  These two come together in ways I've not seen before on screen.  The transgressive sex scenes are surprising from minute to minute and both characters are dynamic beyond all expectation.  Both are conceived as contradictions.  Erika is brilliant about music, insane about human relations.  Walter is a normal guy, a hockey coach, a future engineer, but he plays piano recklessly and brilliantly and his musical thinking is mature.  He is ready for the battleground that is Huppert's Erika and when they clash in horrible sexual warfare, both are changed.  He pops back, but is drawn into her sadomasochistic games.  She loses it and is going through a series of meltdowns, yet she remains visibly enough in control to be expected to play piano at a major recital when she has disabled her female student.  Huppert is remarkable, but Magimel is completely authentic in all the most intense and ruthlessly intimate sex scenes  he knows exactly what he needs to do.`La Pianiste' in other words is actor-driven, so when it won the Grand Prize at Cannes it was inevitable that Huppert and Magimel would get the Best Actress and Best Actor awards.  It's hard to conceive the movie without them.  The Grand Prize also signals recognition of Haneke as a major European filmmaker.  Is it a desire to transcend his Austrian culture and become more pan-European that has led him to make his last two movies in French, and set `Code Unknown,' also a controversial film, in Paris?  Why specifically does everyone in `La Pianiste,' which takes place mainly at the Vienna Conservatory, speak French?  To accommodate Huppert?  To modulate the cold Teutonic tone of the Austrian novel the movie's based on?  Or perhaps &#150; my theory &#150; to make the whole story more abstract &#150; because it's not just about sadomasochistic craziness but about cloying family ties, frustration, and abusive mentors, especially piano teachers?  Rumor has it that piano teachers are sometimes as cruel as this.  They just don't have Huppert's chutzpah, froideur, and elegant sexiness.  In a way this is a fantasy about what a really, really mean piano teacher might be like in her spare time if our worst nightmares about her were true.  This story is, certainly, about our worst nightmares, our repressions, the things we've imagined that we don't want to talk about, the sickness in our relationship with our mother and with our lovers.  To deal with desperation and human limits is not to step away completely from everyday experience but to examine it under a microscope.  Haneke takes us to places we have been before in our minds and in our emotions.Walter (Magimel) is the voice of normality.  He's a nice guy, a friendly, self confident, healthy, helpful athlete  he's a little like Wayne Gretsky. But though he laughs when he reads Erika's kinky, sick instructions for their sexual relations, then tells her she disgusts him and he will have no more to do with her, he's in love with her, so he winds up little by little starting to follow the instructions in spite of himself.  Because of his admiration and love, he becomes another person.  `La Pianiste' is about crossing the line, losing control in a world (like a conservatory of music) where control is the watchword.  Walter laughs for us; he expresses our discomfort with Erika's insanity, and thus, as over-the-top as the movie becomes, we stay with it and disquietingly within it.This is a transgressive analysis of emotion that's true to general human experience.  I've been emotionally strung out with a lover (who hasn't?) and all this craziness spoke to my own emotional memories.  `La Pianiste' has disgusting things in it, and I'm no masochist &#150; not even as a moviegoer &#150; but this is a terrific movie, perhaps a great one.

This movie is for people who demand more, but not MUCH more!  Matt's hair is now brown instead of blond, and he now goes for a whole movie without flashing his big white teeth in a pretty boy smile. He is trying to look like a tough competitor for action films, so all the roles don't go to his pal Ben Affleck or to Tom Cruise.  Does it work?  Sure, Matt is a fine actor, and great to look at, too.      ***Possible Spoilers***  This movie is supposedly based on a Robert Ludlum book.  The script was probably good when it was written, but as it got doctored up and edited to bits, it's a ridiculous mess.  That is why I prefer independent films, where the writer is often the actual writer-- rather than having a whole crew of hacks deciding what the story will be.      The story, as far as I can figure, is about a CIA assassin (Matt Damon) who goes onto a yacht to kill an African man with a French accent, who is some sort of leader of somebody and has an attitude problem that makes someone else want to kill him. Anyway, the assassin gets shot and tossed in the ocean, where he is rescued by a boatful of extras and stuntmen who look vaguely Eastern European.  Oddly, the same extras and stuntmen are used much later in the film to play CIA agents who come to attack Matt Damon in his hotel room.    The whole idea here is amnesia, which as far as I know, only occurs in movies. The assassin can't remember who he is or why people are chasing him.  The people chasing him, as it turns out, are his employers, and the audience can never really understand why they are chasing him, either.   The CIA has imbedded some sort of little capsule, the size of a little vitamin pill, into the assassin's skin.  When it is excised, the capsule shines a little light that projects the name of a bank and an account number.  How convenient!  Matt knows what Swiss bank to go to, and his account number.  He goes there and gets into his safe deposit box to find a big pile of money and a bunch of fake I.D.s.  This would make his life a lot easier, except he packs the  stuff into a red bag, which makes him easier to spot wherever he goes.  He can get a car, hair dye, scissors, etc, but cannot seem to locate a different bag in all of Europe.  When police are chasing him and calling out Hey, red bag!, that would seem to be a clue to get a new bag.            Matt, the assassin, aware that the CIA is trying to kill him, sets up a meeting with his CIA boss out on a bridge in Paris.  Why?  To kill him?  To be killed?  We don't know or care!     In this movie we see Matt climbing on a rusty fire escape, down the outside of a smooth brick building, driving in a clever chase scene where his vehicle is a pokey little car, fighting off and shooting lots of guys, blowing things up, etc.  The women's roles in this movie are hilarious!  Franke Potente gets to stand within arm's length and watch as Matt fights a CIA goon to the death.  It never occurs to the goon to harm her, and she does not appear afraid, she just stands there and watches!  Later, the same thing happen with Julia Stiles just standing there!  Apparently, women in this movie are invisible and invulnerable to harm.   This movie is goofy, mindless fun, for those who want to see beautiful grayish cinematography of sights in Europe.  It is sure to be a big hit in Europe!  It is surely not Oscar material, or even anything you will want to see twice, unless you are fixated on Matt or Franke.

He goes there and gets into his safe deposit box to find a big pile of money and a bunch of fake I.D.s.  This would make his life a lot easier, except he packs the  stuff into a red bag, which makes him easier to spot wherever he goes.  He can get a car, hair dye, scissors, etc, but cannot seem to locate a different bag in all of Europe.  When police are chasing him and calling out Hey, red bag!, that would seem to be a clue to get a new bag.            Matt, the assassin, aware that the CIA is trying to kill him, sets up a meeting with his CIA boss out on a bridge in Paris.  Why?  To kill him?  To be killed?  We don't know or care!     In this movie we see Matt climbing on a rusty fire escape, down the outside of a smooth brick building, driving in a clever chase scene where his vehicle is a pokey little car, fighting off and shooting lots of guys, blowing things up, etc.  The women's roles in this movie are hilarious!  Franke Potente gets to stand within arm's length and watch as Matt fights a CIA goon to the death.  It never occurs to the goon to harm her, and she does not appear afraid, she just stands there and watches!  Later, the same thing happen with Julia Stiles just standing there!  Apparently, women in this movie are invisible and invulnerable to harm.   This movie is goofy, mindless fun, for those who want to see beautiful grayish cinematography of sights in Europe.  It is sure to be a big hit in Europe!  It is surely not Oscar material, or even anything you will want to see twice, unless you are fixated on Matt or Franke.

This movie is for people who demand more, but not MUCH more!  Matt's hair is now brown instead of blond, and he now goes for a whole movie without flashing his big white teeth in a pretty boy smile. He is trying to look like a tough competitor for action films, so all the roles don't go to his pal Ben Affleck or to Tom Cruise.  Does it work?  Sure, Matt is a fine actor, and great to look at, too.      ***Possible Spoilers***  This movie is supposedly based on a Robert Ludlum book.  The script was probably good when it was written, but as it got doctored up and edited to bits, it's a ridiculous mess.  That is why I prefer independent films, where the writer is often the actual writer-- rather than having a whole crew of hacks deciding what the story will be.      The story, as far as I can figure, is about a CIA assassin (Matt Damon) who goes onto a yacht to kill an African man with a French accent, who is some sort of leader of somebody and has an attitude problem that makes someone else want to kill him. Anyway, the assassin gets shot and tossed in the ocean, where he is rescued by a boatful of extras and stuntmen who look vaguely Eastern European.  Oddly, the same extras and stuntmen are used much later in the film to play CIA agents who come to attack Matt Damon in his hotel room.    The whole idea here is amnesia, which as far as I know, only occurs in movies. The assassin can't remember who he is or why people are chasing him.  The people chasing him, as it turns out, are his employers, and the audience can never really understand why they are chasing him, either.   The CIA has imbedded some sort of little capsule, the size of a little vitamin pill, into the assassin's skin.

Predator 2 is one of those rare times. In Predator 2, the acting, story line and action sequences are superior to Predator 1. Predator one was good and introduced us to the Predator. However Arnold's acting was a bit bad however the purpose of the first film was not to garner Arnold Schwarzenegger an Academy Award nomination. Danny Glover is a much better actor. The movie opens up with a scene of a jungle much like the one in Predator one. Then it shows that that jungle is right outside Los Angeles, a concrete jungle.  The second film also gave us a glimpse into the future. The future then was 1997. It showed how drug gangs ruled the cities and acted more like armed political factions than the traditional drug gangs. You have the police who are basically under siege and powerless against these drug gangs. Cops are out gunned and out numbered. Then we throw the Predator in the mix. I found myself cheering for the alien as he killed members of both drug gangs in pretty creative ways. Then comes Danny Glover's character LAPD Lieutenant Mike Harrigan. He's tough as nails and commands a unit of elite cops. The members of his unit are also great actors in their own right. There's Maria Conchita Olanzo, Ruben Blades and a young cocky Bill Paxton. Harrigan is targeted by the alien Predator after the Predator witnesses Harrigans heroic rescue of wounded cops in the opening fire fight. As the movie moves along we find out that as the Predator is hunting the Hispanic drug gang, the Jamacan drug gang and the police, a secret government group is hunting the Predator. The leader of this secret government group is well acted by Gary Busey. Busey and his group want to capture the alien and learn about it's technology. This makes for more people with guns the Alien can hunt. This makes the movie more complex. But it all boils down to the Predators desire to go one on one with Mike Harrigan. Then the Predator gets what he wants however the Predator becomes the prey and Harrigan the hunter. In the end we get a glimpse or the sense of honor the Predators have after Glover kills the Predator. The Predator's buddies actually respect Harrigan and give him a trophy for his kill.

Victor Salva (I don't care if I get his name right) fished it out of the trash and TRIED to make it into a movie.Don't get me wrong, I've watched all of the classic horror films. The main characters are just too stupid to be believable, ESPECIALLY by the old classics. This movie DOES NOT REMIND ME OF THE OLD SCHOOL classics, it reminds of some new school poop.Down to the movies itself. Dialogue Attrocious, examples Don't try and be a hero!

It would have been more factually accurate to put a gun from the old Spaghetti Westerns in this film, as a matter of fact.

If something happens in a film and you find it so outrageous that you want to get up off the coach, reach through the screen and hit someone has done its job (unless it's a Pauly Shore movie, in which case you want to hit the producer).Seriously, Full Metal Jacket is probably Stanley Kubrick's best film. It's based on a novel called The Short Timers and is told in three parts, although most people think of it as two halves. The title refers to the hard metal casing surrounding the soft lead core of the bullets used in the M-16's and M-14's the Marines used in Vietnam. It's also an allegory, described the hard shells that are molded around soft, impressionable young men when they become killers as impersonal as a bullet during war.The first part of the film is easily the best. Young recruits arrive at bootcamp, get their heads shaved and meet the drill sergeant (played to perfection by R. Lee Ermey, a then-recently retired real life Marine drill instructor). He curses at them and screams at them, assigning them goofball names that describe their personalities while dehumanizing them. The chief recruits here are Private Joker (Matthew Modine), who is here mostly because he doesn't want to join the Army; Private Cowboy (Arliss Howard, who's here because he wants to be), and Private Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio, who doesn't have a clue about life off the farm and is in for a rude awakening). Watching these numb nuts get turned into emotionless killing machines is quite disturbing at times. Even outrageous, although it is based on real Marine Corps training doctrine. Take, for instance, the marksmanship scene where R. Lee Ermey highlights Charles Whitman, who shot several people from the tower at the University of Texas, and Lee Harvey Oswald, who allegedly shot a mobile JFK from the sixth floor of a book depository. He then asks where both men got their marksmanship training -- the Marine Corps, as if he really wanted to glorify these guys just because they were Marines. Watching that, I wanted to reach through the TV and joke Ermey.Part two follows Joker to Vietnam. Many people think the movie went downhill from here, but it is an essential part of the movie. Joker and his fellow Marines were trained to be killers, but they were trained to fight an old war. America was used to wars like Korea and World War II where you had a clearly defined enemy and clearly defined battlefields. Instead, we get men sitting around doing nothing, waiting to go into battle the next day like going to the office. Vietnamese women sell themselves openly while young Vietnamese men wait to either steal cameras or shoot GIs. Joker talks like he's ready for combat, but when the Tet Offensive opens in 1968 and he has to man a machine gun to protect his base, he finds out he's not ready. It's eerie to watch the Marines when they have to retake Hue City. They actually look happy as they mass up and walk behind tanks because the war is finally looking like what they had been trained for -- a straight up fight between two armies. The most interesting part of this section of the film is where a TV crew interviews Marines. Some of the comments are ordinary, some are profound and some are just plain boastful, if not moronic (if you watch some of the reality-based TV shows today, you'll understand).The third and final section of the film depicts the biggest battle of Vietnam -- how it really changed the men fighting it. Joker hooks back up with Cowboy as he is leading his squad to an old part of Hue City where military intelligence thinks some enemy soldiers are holed up. The squad is ambushed and several members are killed. The squad shoots up an entire building in response, but don't hit the sniper. The harrowing scene has Dorian Harewood lying wounded in the open as the sniper shoots holes in him trying to lure his buddies out of hiding (John Wayne's Sands of Iwo Jima hinted at this scenario and Saving Private Ryan copied it). It's almost repulsive to see American soldiers cowering when one of their own is in need of help, but this is the reality of war. Later, when the surviving squad members finally get up the courage to hunt down the sniper, we get to see the true effect of war. Joker is trying to maintain his sense of morality while the other squad members are eager for revenge. Kubrick was trying to show the real tragedy of Vietnam in that most of the soldiers were not like Joker. They were hardened and haunted by war, but when it was all over, you knew they would be sent straight back into society (Think of Sylvester Stallone's Rambo in First Blood who wanders around homeless and aimless because Col. Trautman trained him for war, but not for peace).The camera work of the film is great, especially the choppy style that gives us a bird's-eye view as soldiers run for cover. Kubrick never tries to overwhelm us, just show us the truth. The movie has been hailed by many critics as the best war movie ever made and I agree, although Das Boot and Saving Private Ryan are close. It is not an anti-war movie, per se, because it just shows what really went on in training and during the war. It doesn't take sides, like, say, John Wayne's unabashedly patriotic The Green Berets (which, by the way, inadvertently, showed the futility of combat in Vietnam during the camp attack scene).Overall, I rate this 9\/10. Too bad Kubrick died with Eyes Wide Shut as his last film. Hopefully, people will remember Full Metal Jacket instead. ","genre":null},{"date":"30 June 2002","score":"","review":"  That's right.

Young recruits arrive at bootcamp, get their heads shaved and meet the drill sergeant (played to perfection by R. Lee Ermey, a then-recently retired real life Marine drill instructor). He curses at them and screams at them, assigning them goofball names that describe their personalities while dehumanizing them. The chief recruits here are Private Joker (Matthew Modine), who is here mostly because he doesn't want to join the Army; Private Cowboy (Arliss Howard, who's here because he wants to be), and Private Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio, who doesn't have a clue about life off the farm and is in for a rude awakening). Watching these numb nuts get turned into emotionless killing machines is quite disturbing at times. Even outrageous, although it is based on real Marine Corps training doctrine. Take, for instance, the marksmanship scene where R. Lee Ermey highlights Charles Whitman, who shot several people from the tower at the University of Texas, and Lee Harvey Oswald, who allegedly shot a mobile JFK from the sixth floor of a book depository. He then asks where both men got their marksmanship training -- the Marine Corps, as if he really wanted to glorify these guys just because they were Marines. Watching that, I wanted to reach through the TV and joke Ermey.Part two follows Joker to Vietnam. Many people think the movie went downhill from here, but it is an essential part of the movie. Joker and his fellow Marines were trained to be killers, but they were trained to fight an old war. America was used to wars like Korea and World War II where you had a clearly defined enemy and clearly defined battlefields. Instead, we get men sitting around doing nothing, waiting to go into battle the next day like going to the office. Vietnamese women sell themselves openly while young Vietnamese men wait to either steal cameras or shoot GIs. Joker talks like he's ready for combat, but when the Tet Offensive opens in 1968 and he has to man a machine gun to protect his base, he finds out he's not ready. It's eerie to watch the Marines when they have to retake Hue City. They actually look happy as they mass up and walk behind tanks because the war is finally looking like what they had been trained for -- a straight up fight between two armies. The most interesting part of this section of the film is where a TV crew interviews Marines. Some of the comments are ordinary, some are profound and some are just plain boastful, if not moronic (if you watch some of the reality-based TV shows today, you'll understand).The third and final section of the film depicts the biggest battle of Vietnam -- how it really changed the men fighting it. Joker hooks back up with Cowboy as he is leading his squad to an old part of Hue City where military intelligence thinks some enemy soldiers are holed up. The squad is ambushed and several members are killed. The squad shoots up an entire building in response, but don't hit the sniper. The harrowing scene has Dorian Harewood lying wounded in the open as the sniper shoots holes in him trying to lure his buddies out of hiding (John Wayne's Sands of Iwo Jima hinted at this scenario and Saving Private Ryan copied it). It's almost repulsive to see American soldiers cowering when one of their own is in need of help, but this is the reality of war. Later, when the surviving squad members finally get up the courage to hunt down the sniper, we get to see the true effect of war. Joker is trying to maintain his sense of morality while the other squad members are eager for revenge. Kubrick was trying to show the real tragedy of Vietnam in that most of the soldiers were not like Joker. They were hardened and haunted by war, but when it was all over, you knew they would be sent straight back into society (Think of Sylvester Stallone's Rambo in First Blood who wanders around homeless and aimless because Col. Trautman trained him for war, but not for peace).The camera work of the film is great, especially the choppy style that gives us a bird's-eye view as soldiers run for cover. Kubrick never tries to overwhelm us, just show us the truth. The movie has been hailed by many critics as the best war movie ever made and I agree, although Das Boot and Saving Private Ryan are close. It is not an anti-war movie, per se, because it just shows what really went on in training and during the war. It doesn't take sides, like, say, John Wayne's unabashedly patriotic The Green Berets (which, by the way, inadvertently, showed the futility of combat in Vietnam during the camp attack scene).Overall, I rate this 9\/10. Too bad Kubrick died with Eyes Wide Shut as his last film. Hopefully, people will remember Full Metal Jacket instead. ","genre":"Drama, War"},{"date":"30 June 2002","score":"","review":"  That's right. If something happens in a film and you find it so outrageous that you want to get up off the coach, reach through the screen and hit someone has done its job (unless it's a Pauly Shore movie, in which case you want to hit the producer).Seriously, Full Metal Jacket is probably Stanley Kubrick's best film. It's based on a novel called The Short Timers and is told in three parts, although most people think of it as two halves.

My expectations did increase the moment I noticed that top billing goes to Sam Neill (The Piano, Jurassic Park, Reilly Ace of Spies). Don't hold this against the movie, but the true story of Australia's role in the first moon landing gives it redeeming educational value as well as  some suspense, believe it or not. I had no idea that the Australians were suffering from so many glitches that it was a miracle that they pulled it off. There are many funny moments in the movie such as when the likeable but clueless security guard, Rudi, says, Halt, who goes there? and after a moment you here a sheep bleating. Yes, the most sophisticated radio telescope in the Southern Hemisphere in 1969 was in the middle of a sheep paddock. Another noteworthy feature is the movie's soundtrack. I can say, having lived in 1969, that the movie reflects what people actually heard when they turned on the radio that year, as opposed to the usual best of soundtrack you hear in most movies set in the sixties. For that reason I couldn't recommend the CD of this movie's soundtrack if it exists.
