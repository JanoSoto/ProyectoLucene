How can a film so completely turn its back on the premise of the franchise (and more importantly the books which structured it)? How can you screw up such a basic but entertaining idea? Well, Jurassic Park III does a pretty good job of the above.Starting off with this film butchering of the themes of the series. The whole idea of Jurassic park (the novel and subsequent films) was that it depicted the dinosaurs,for the first time, as normal animals not monsters. I mean Sam Neill in JP even explicitly stated this. The idea of life finding a way was draped all over the first film and The Lost World continued that on, however JP III does not follow this idea in a variety of ways The Raptor's can communicate? The Spinosauraus has no incentive to attack the actors but it just does. The raptors are intelligent enough to let the main characters go free at the end but savagely kill anybody else who they believe have their eggs?Another instance of the slaughter of Jurassic Park is the look of the Dinosaurs themselves. Many are new or have been given a makeover and most look and act more aggressively than the previous films. (I mean the Brachiorsauraus went from a typical mottled green look to a red and green monster with sharp teeth?). On the DVD extras the people who worked on this film boast about how real the animals looked but I honestly didn't see that in the film. Apart from the fact that they jiggle and are fatter than before there is little inspiration. Come to think of it all the new dinosaurs appeared to be either red or green or a bit of both...However what really annoyed me (and it seems many others) was the killing of T-Rex and the emergence of Spinosauraus. They have a sort of Kenobi-Vader Showdown where T-Rex (the master who hunts only for the need for food) is killed by Spino (the learner who seems to rather enjoy chasing the people around and kill other dinosaurs for no reason. It is explained why they are chased by Spino but the reason is so pitiful its an obvious after thought. But getting back to the point, Killing off T-Rex? Big mistake. It has sparked quite a debate about who would actually win. From what I've heard Spino was bigger but T-Rex was designed to tackle large prey while Spino was more equipped for fish. No matter what some people may say about Spino being bigger that doesn't necessary mean it would be a better fighter...I mean a basketball player is bigger than a boxer but who would you pick in a fight? Although obviously for the makers of JPIII Bigger=Better. On a side note I wonder which T-Rex it was from TLW?As stated before little plot was involved in the film and being only 90 minutes long that is unsurprising. 90 minutes? Where did the suspense go from the previous two films? The reason for this? It's a non-stop action film, it is claimed. Fine if we're talking about a video-game movie but not for Jurassic Park. I look at it this way, on a pure entertainment level at least The Lost World has 30 minutes more value than JP III. The makers completely lost the focus of the franchise in this film.The makers to their cried did try to put in a little continuity i.e. the smashed windows of the car in the compound for example, as the film was based on the same island as TLW but it seemed poorly done. Why is the island so different from before? From wide open grassy plains and coniferous forests to tight claustrophobic jungles? A lot is left unexplained...And the raptors? That deserves an article on its own...Another stupid point was again the idea of kid being able to survive a situation where full grown adults with guns cannot. 8 weeks? When experienced mercenaries barely survive for 5 minutes?

One of the best characters in the series snuffed out in the blink of an eye, tainted by association to this atrocity. And speaking generally about characters, who actually liked the Kirby family or Billy?So in summary, no plot, no good characters, tired, bored acting, an annoying kid, killing T-REX? Disgrace....

Girl or boy gets bullied for being different. Shy, strange, unusual, etc. Stephen King wrote a book about such a situation and they turned it into one of the best horror films in recent history.'Carrie' is one of my favourite films, for many reasons. It's funny, it's sharp, it's scary, and it's tragic, all at the same time. Sissy Spacek gives a stunning performance as the tortured and bullied Carrie White, living with her religious fanatic mother and suffering the trauma of her first period at seventeen years of age. What should be an exciting time for her is one of misery and bitterness because her own mother didn't think to tell her about the female cycle-and when to her horror she finally began it in the school locker rooms, she was subjected to laughter and humiliation from the other girls, who resorted to throwing tampons and sanitary towels at her. However, actions can have consequences, and I've never enjoyed watching a film so much before. I read the book before I saw the film, and I wasn't disappointed. Brian De Palma was faithful to King's story, and cast wonderful actors to play these important parts, and they were all important to the plot, whether big or small. That's what was so wonderful about 'Carrie'.Spacek fully deserved her Oscar nomination for this performance. She was 27 years old when she played a 17 year old Carrie, and she pulled off the lost and alone little girl to perfection, and completely surpassed herself when Carrie finally snapped at the end. Her pairing with Piper Laurie as Margaret White was dynamic, one of the most interesting screen matches ever, and the two actresses conveyed the volatile mother-daughter relationship perfectly. Carrie didn't understand why her mother thought that everything, including periods, dating and sex was a sin, and thought that maybe by mixing with the other students properly, she could fit in and be treated like everyone else. Even when she realised the extent of her powers, all she wanted to do was not have to use them and be like other people. Her need for normal life and her craving for her mother's affection was heartrending, poignant and brilliantly conveyed by Spacek.I loved Amy Irving's performance as the remorseful Sue, one of the popular girls who feels so sorry for Carrie and guilty for the locker room incident that she asks her own boyfriend to take Carrie to the prom. Of course, anyone who has seen this movie will know that things don't go quite according to plan at the prom, thanks to the evil plotting of biggest school bully and glamour princess Chris Hargenson (a great performance from Nancy Allen) and her deadbeat boyfriend Billy (hilariously played by John Travolta). I don't want to completely give away the ending if you haven't seen this movie but I can tell you it's shocking, dramatic and incredibly moving.Naturally, compared to horror films made nowadays Carrie is extremely dated and didn't have the same kind of effects they can use now, but the effects that were used in this film (including the sound effects) were terrifying and realistic, and made you realise that anyone with those kind of powers can be capable of anything when driven to the edge.

After the success of the groundbreaking Fistful of Dollars, Sergio Leone returned with his second instalment in the dollars trilogy. The scale was bigger, the style was bolder, and the moral standards were lower.The title itself works on many levels. The films budget was of course somewhat more than the cheaply made Fistful. On top of that everything is pushed just a little further in this picture. Whereas Fistful was just set in one town, we now travel all over the old west, and for the first time we see those incredible landscape shots that Leone did so well. The direction and storytelling is much more confident. There is a fairly bizarre level of stylisation, with huge facial close-ups, fast paced editing and long-drawn out stand-offs.Many viewers talk of Leone's debt to classic Hollywood westerns, as well as the films of Akira Kurosawa, but while these are part of the mix his style really reminds me of nothing more than Sergei Eisenstein at his most flamboyant. Think about those fast edits between Mortimer's face and Indio's poster, or the series of close-ups during each build up to a gunfight, then look at Eisenstein's Strike or October and you'll see what I mean. Those films must have been a massive influence on Leone, although it's rarely acknowledged.Each of the three main characters gets their own lengthy introductory scene which take up nearly a full half hour before the story really gets underway. We open with Mortimer, his head buried in a bible. Given the way he acts afterwards &#150; forcing the train to stop, intimidating people and coldly and calmly killing an outlaw &#150; this is an example of the rather ambiguous attitude Leone takes towards religion throughout this and his other pictures. Manco first appears in a thunderstorm. Indio's first scene is gloomy and sinister. All three men are established as killers. Nearly all the characters are after one thing &#150; money. It's not just the bandits and bounty hunters. Even the boy who holds Manco's horse is always after another dollar. I say nearly all the characters &#150; there is of course one goal more important in the spaghetti western than money, and that is vengeance.For a Few Dollars more isn't just bigger in every way, it's also better in that it is more professional, particularly the acting. Clint Eastwood had by now gained more confidence, and had perfected his slow, silent, moody persona that would become his trademark. There are plenty of great supporting parts, and the dubbing of Italian actors is pretty seamless. However the real jewel in the crown was the rediscovery of Lee Van Cleef. Van Cleef had made a career of bit parts in Hollywood westerns, usually as a mean-looking outlaw. Leone cast him as the most heroic and honest of the three main characters. Perhaps a touch of irony was intended, but the truth is Van Cleef turned out to be a great actor (I'm always particularly struck by the very genuinely emotional look on his face when he realises Manco has taken his watch), and ideally suited to playing the good guy for a change. Having retired once in Hollywood, he eventually enjoyed a second career as one of the most prominent leading men in the spaghetti western genre.Of course, the mix of Leone's films wouldn't be complete without the music of Ennio Morricone, and here for the first time director and composer are truly in synch. Morricone is truly Leone's musical equivalent. Just like Leone's shooting style, Morricone's music isn't afraid to draw attention to itself. In this era a good film score was supposed to be one you didn't notice, but Morricone does the opposite. It is weird, wonderful and very listenable in its own right. The music in For a Few Dollars more is also matched up to the action in a way that hadn't happened since the days of silent cinema. Each character gets their own little musical motif &#150; Mortimer has the Jewish harp twangs, Manco the bouncy flute melody and Indio the ominous bells. It's not a background score &#150; it's excessive musical punctuation for Leone's style. In that first great duel in the church between Indio and the man who turned him in, when you hear that eerie little pocket watch tune, and then the organ crashes in with a rip-off of Bach's Toccata &#150; then you know you're in the Leone zone!

The direction and storytelling is much more confident. There is a fairly bizarre level of stylisation, with huge facial close-ups, fast paced editing and long-drawn out stand-offs.Many viewers talk of Leone's debt to classic Hollywood westerns, as well as the films of Akira Kurosawa, but while these are part of the mix his style really reminds me of nothing more than Sergei Eisenstein at his most flamboyant. Think about those fast edits between Mortimer's face and Indio's poster, or the series of close-ups during each build up to a gunfight, then look at Eisenstein's Strike or October and you'll see what I mean. Those films must have been a massive influence on Leone, although it's rarely acknowledged.Each of the three main characters gets their own lengthy introductory scene which take up nearly a full half hour before the story really gets underway.

Given the way he acts afterwards &#150; forcing the train to stop, intimidating people and coldly and calmly killing an outlaw &#150; this is an example of the rather ambiguous attitude Leone takes towards religion throughout this and his other pictures. Manco first appears in a thunderstorm. Indio's first scene is gloomy and sinister. All three men are established as killers. Nearly all the characters are after one thing &#150; money. It's not just the bandits and bounty hunters. Even the boy who holds Manco's horse is always after another dollar. I say nearly all the characters &#150; there is of course one goal more important in the spaghetti western than money, and that is vengeance.For a Few Dollars more isn't just bigger in every way, it's also better in that it is more professional, particularly the acting. Clint Eastwood had by now gained more confidence, and had perfected his slow, silent, moody persona that would become his trademark. There are plenty of great supporting parts, and the dubbing of Italian actors is pretty seamless. However the real jewel in the crown was the rediscovery of Lee Van Cleef. Van Cleef had made a career of bit parts in Hollywood westerns, usually as a mean-looking outlaw. Leone cast him as the most heroic and honest of the three main characters. Perhaps a touch of irony was intended, but the truth is Van Cleef turned out to be a great actor (I'm always particularly struck by the very genuinely emotional look on his face when he realises Manco has taken his watch), and ideally suited to playing the good guy for a change. Having retired once in Hollywood, he eventually enjoyed a second career as one of the most prominent leading men in the spaghetti western genre.Of course, the mix of Leone's films wouldn't be complete without the music of Ennio Morricone, and here for the first time director and composer are truly in synch. Morricone is truly Leone's musical equivalent. Just like Leone's shooting style, Morricone's music isn't afraid to draw attention to itself. In this era a good film score was supposed to be one you didn't notice, but Morricone does the opposite. It is weird, wonderful and very listenable in its own right. The music in For a Few Dollars more is also matched up to the action in a way that hadn't happened since the days of silent cinema. Each character gets their own little musical motif &#150; Mortimer has the Jewish harp twangs, Manco the bouncy flute melody and Indio the ominous bells. It's not a background score &#150; it's excessive musical punctuation for Leone's style. In that first great duel in the church between Indio and the man who turned him in, when you hear that eerie little pocket watch tune, and then the organ crashes in with a rip-off of Bach's Toccata &#150; then you know you're in the Leone zone!

The main theme I think is the friendship between Sydney Schanberg (Sam Waterston), a journalist for The New York Times who is sent to cover the war between the country's revolutionary Khmer Rouge and Dith Pran (Dr Haing S. Ngor), his assistant who acts as an interpreter,guide and journalist\/photographer. There are some very touching scenes between the two men, it is lovely to see two men who love one another, almost like brothers. The two actors Sam Waterston and Dr. Haing S. Ngor are just brilliant and had we in tears when they have to said goodbye to one another and Pran has to leave the embassy and they both know what happens to people like Pran. I especially loved the scene when they meet again and Pran runs into Sydney's arms and he tells Sydney that there is nothing to forgive.I like the fact that the film flips between the two characters. We see Sydney desperately trying to find Pran and Pran trying to survive the starvation and torture and he can never be himself, he must keep himself guarded because he knows they will kill him. One of the most gripping scenes is when Pran has escaped the camp and he comes across the most gruesome sight of skeletons littered all over the place. The film is not afraid to show graphic scenes of the violence that was going on at the time in Cambodia which is not sugarcoated but it shows the brutality that men can show towards each other.I feel the heart of the film is Pran. He suffered harsh treatment, starvation and torture from the Khmer Rouge and he doesn't seem to hate these people. He just accepts that he must follow their rules to survive so he can be with his family again.Just because the film is based on a real story, doesn't mean you have a happy feeling inside you, that you know that Pran beats them and survives and is reunited with his friend and family. There is still tension and you are gripped when you see what Pran goes through to survive.The music by Mike Oldfield is so appropriate and fits the mood of the environment. It is very well directed by Roland Joffe who keeps us to the edge of our seats up to the end.I think what also helps is the fact that the actor playing Pran, Dr Haing S. Ngor went through the same thing as Pran and who better to know what Pran went through, then this man who was tortured and had to deny being a doctor and couldn't save his wife in childbirth for fear they would both be killed. It is amazing that it was his first film role and he definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. It is also sad that he survived Cambodia, only to be killed in a robbery.

Coming between the over-the-top action melodrama of Strike and the formalist documentary style of October, it's the most normal looking of his silent films. Rather than being overly stylised it best demonstrates how the montage technique can be used in regular cinematic storytelling.Eisenstein here takes the editing techniques he perfected in his first film Strike, and uses them to greater effect in telling the story, creating tension and staging action. Whereas the action in Strike was almost relentless, Potemkin contains moments of stillness and calmness which act as a counterpoint to the more exciting situations, making them tenser and more effective. He stretches out time to an incredible extent, sometimes even splitting sentences over two title cards. He also slows things down to give certain scenes greater consideration. The section in which Vakulinchuk's body is brought to the pier and visited by Odessa citizens has a slow tranquillity to it, which gives it an air of sadness.When Battleship Potemkin does burst into moments of action, the direction is tighter than ever. Looking at the most famous sequence &#150; The Odessa Steps massacre &#150; the scenes of mass panic begin before we are actually shown what is causing them. If you watch closely, you can see how well directed the crowd scenes are. It's not just a hundred or so people dashing madly down the steps, there are also for example some people confusedly trying to cut across the crowd, implying Eisenstein directed the group at the level of individuals, and took real care composing each shot.On that note, although Eisenstein's silent cinema is characterless and based around the actions of masses of people rather, he still has respect for the individual, and often uses the action or experience of one person to hammer home a message. For example, the opening sequences with the sailors becoming tense and angry all builds up to that one man smashing a plate. Later in the Odessa harbour, shots of the crowd are intercut with close-ups of fists clenching. And of course although the Odessa Steps sequence involves hundreds of people, it's the individuals that we remember most &#150; the mother and child, the woman with the pram, the man with no legs and so on. Eisenstein also makes the impact of the set pieces all the greater by introducing us to these characters just prior to the massacre.Eisenstein's symbolism, which was rather heavy handed in Strike, is here much subtler and cleverer. It is also much more skilfully woven into the narrative. For example, when Vakulinchuk makes his first big speech, he is both literally and metaphorically waking up the other sailors. Later, the boiling soup is used as a metaphor for the sailors seething with rage. Even the title of the first part &#150; the Men and the Maggots can be taken as a reference to the difference between the sailors (real men) and the despicable officers who command them.Eisenstein is also now a little more reserved in his use of artificial cinematic techniques, such as superimpositions and lens masking. These techniques were all over the place in Strike, but here they just crop up once or twice, giving them greater impact when they do appear. It also shows more confidence in his own direction &#150; he doesn't have to rely on cinematic trickery to hold the audience's attention anymore.Eisenstein's silent pictures are arguably the most totally cinematic of their era. By taking the possibilities of the editing process to their extremes, he follows on from D.W. Griffith to further cut cinema free from its ties to theatre and literature, helping establish it as a unique storytelling form. As a result Eisenstein's other silent pictures sometimes suffer from too much style over substance.

I could call this part of the film 'fun' but since it takes ages to really get going I was already sighing and checking how much time was left. At 85 minutes I was beginning to wonder how he was ever going to find the people who attacked his family and sort them out with only a few minutes of the running time left. It turns out that they are never seen again, so they basically get away it. WHAT KIND OF ENDING IS THAT??? What a rip-off.Compared to Death Wish II (my God, what a disgusting film) this film seems relatively okay. But alone it's yet another exploitational piece of crap by a notoriously incompetent director. A classic is sure as hell ain't!

Jeffrey's pain is that he's sworn off sex altogether. About this time he meets the Man of His Dreams (Michael T. Weiss, oozing dark masculinity). The catch this Man is HIV-positive. So the dilemma lies to be with a man who may or may not survive such a deadly disease (and risk his own life, since a moment of passion may be the dividing line between life and death) or to turn around and continue looking for Mr. Goodbar, even when Mr. Goodbar is right there for the asking.The premise makes for a a story that should be much, much darker and introspective, but Paul Rudnick has decided to make it a romantic comedy, and it works for the most part. Again, and going back to the top of this article, it's the supporting characters and bit players who make the adventures of Jeffrey worth experiencing consider one surreal scene where Jeffrey calls his parents, who are extremely, implausibly, hilariously in tune with the times (when in fact they shouldn't) and go into frank discussions about Jeffrey's (lack of a) sex life. Looking at them, all 1950s excess, yammering in gay lingo, is enough to have anyone rolling on the floor.Other scenes are of equal hilarity Patrick Stewart interrupting Kevin Nealon (as a reporter) announcing the sex change of a bit player (then unknown Gregory Ibarra) whose mother (Olympia Dukakis) has a whale of a time posing for cameras, and Nathan Lane as a priest who (unsuccessfully) tries to seduce Weber at church in a rather bizarre moment. Of the cast, however, Bryan Batt is the one who almost walks away with the movie as Stewart's lover, also dying of AIDS, and has some pretty outlandish scenes which make his character memorable. And of course, any movie that lampoons Mother Theresa has to have my vote, especially when it manages to pepper an erstwhile campy romance scene.

It seemed to be weird for weird's sake, like a mash-up of BRAZIL and the FORBIDDEN ZONE.After seeing MULHOLLAND DR., BLUE VELVET and DUNE, I was ready to accept David Lynch as a great moviemaker and storyteller. Biting the bullet, I found myself a copy of the film that had disgusted me a year and a half earlier.Wow. From those first shots of Henry floating in space, to the enigmatic Man in the Planet sitting in his cramped little room, I was hooked. This wasn't a movie- this was an experience. I hadn't been this absorbed by any film since before middle school. When the credits flashed by to Fats Waller's gleeful music, I was shaken- in all the best possible ways.You have to keep in mind that ERASERHEAD is a film aimed at the soul, not at the brain. Yes, not everything will be explained when the credits roll. In fact, most of the imagery isn't explained at all.The story itself is deceptively simple, and not as inaccessible as most reviewers describe. Henry Spencer is an depressed man living in a world of abandoned factories, railyards, and mounds of dirt. His one-room apartment is a Lower East Side tenement from Hell. One evening his temptress neighbor tells him that his ex-girlfriend and her parents have invited him to dinner. This dinner turns out to be perversely awkward (like MEET THE PARENTS on acid), and it so happens that his ex has given birth to... something (imagine the offspring between a raptor from JURASSIC PARK and a human, except in fetal form). Henry is forced to marry his ex, and they live together in his apartment with the baby. Revealing any more would take away from the fun.The cinematography is amazingly beautiful. It seems Lynch and crew have discovered at least ten different variations of black, making film-noir look like THE WIZARD OF OZ. The rumbling, everpresent soundtrack frequently shifts from sensually overwhelming to breathtaking. When the Lady in the Radiator (Henry's muse) sings In heaven, everything is fine, you are both repulsed by her deformed face and enchanted by one of the most eerie songs in the cinematic universe.It took a grand total of six years from getting financing to putting ERASERHEAD into theaters, and it all seems to have paid off. 1977 is best remembered for giving the world STAR WARS, the beginning of the end of the New Hollywood auteur era. But while studio execs were envisioning the profits of mass-marketed franchises, David Lynch was watching audiences vomit and literally run out of the theater (including the projectionist) at the premier of his first film.Not because it was God-awful, but because it gets into people's heads the way very few other films can.

Heinrich Harrer, a world famous mountain climber and Austrian national hero goes on an expedition in 1939 to conquer an unclimbed peak in the Himalayas. While he's doing his mountain climbing Germany of which Austria is now part of marches into Poland and World War II begins. Harrer and his party are interred as enemy aliens.In 1942 Harrer escaped and he and a friend played by David Thewlis make their way into Tibet. The rest of the film is the seven years he spent there, centered around the unique friendship he formed with the child ruler of Tibet, the Dalai Lama. This in fact is the same Dalai Lama who today is possibly the world's greatest and non-aligned apostle of the gospel of peace.Brad Pitt is never better in the film than he is with the three child actors who play the Dalai Lama at various stages of his life. The physical hardship that he and Thewlis endure just getting into Tibet is adventure enough. But the spiritual journey he undergoes in his time there makes this one of the most unique adventure stories of the last century.One thing I liked about Seven Years in Tibet is that no effort was made to cover up Harrer's Nazi background. In an alternate universe one can speculate on what might have happened to him had he actually had to serve in the army in World War II. His internment saved him from possibly being involved any number of atrocities. God, fate, some kind of higher power saved him for something wonderful. The cinematography is breathtaking, this film had an incredible number of locations. Note that it was shot in British Columbia, in Argentina with the Andes serving as the Himalayas, Austria and even some establishing footage was shot in Tibet itself on the sly.Tibet's status is unique unto the world. It has been part of China since the Ming dynasty. It's referred to properly as the autonomous region of Tibet. China has given it autonomy in varying degrees over the past several centuries, it's never been truly independent. The Communist regime back in the days of Mao Tse-tung brutally asserted it's sovereignty a few times, most notably in late fifties when the Dalai Lama was forced to flee Tibet and live in Northern India where he resides to this day. That is when he's not traveling the world as it's foremost advocate of non-violence.It is sad that this film did not get more box office than it did. Brad Pitt, David Thewlis, director Jean Jacques Arnaud are all persona non grata in the People's Republic of China for making this film.

But the real story of Heinrich Harrer is better than anything a fictional author could have thought up.Brad Pitt is Harrer in Seven Years In Tibet and this has become my favorite film of his. Heinrich Harrer, a world famous mountain climber and Austrian national hero goes on an expedition in 1939 to conquer an unclimbed peak in the Himalayas. While he's doing his mountain climbing Germany of which Austria is now part of marches into Poland and World War II begins. Harrer and his party are interred as enemy aliens.In 1942 Harrer escaped and he and a friend played by David Thewlis make their way into Tibet. The rest of the film is the seven years he spent there, centered around the unique friendship he formed with the child ruler of Tibet, the Dalai Lama. This in fact is the same Dalai Lama who today is possibly the world's greatest and non-aligned apostle of the gospel of peace.Brad Pitt is never better in the film than he is with the three child actors who play the Dalai Lama at various stages of his life. The physical hardship that he and Thewlis endure just getting into Tibet is adventure enough. But the spiritual journey he undergoes in his time there makes this one of the most unique adventure stories of the last century.One thing I liked about Seven Years in Tibet is that no effort was made to cover up Harrer's Nazi background. In an alternate universe one can speculate on what might have happened to him had he actually had to serve in the army in World War II. His internment saved him from possibly being involved any number of atrocities. God, fate, some kind of higher power saved him for something wonderful. The cinematography is breathtaking, this film had an incredible number of locations. Note that it was shot in British Columbia, in Argentina with the Andes serving as the Himalayas, Austria and even some establishing footage was shot in Tibet itself on the sly.Tibet's status is unique unto the world. It has been part of China since the Ming dynasty. It's referred to properly as the autonomous region of Tibet. China has given it autonomy in varying degrees over the past several centuries, it's never been truly independent. The Communist regime back in the days of Mao Tse-tung brutally asserted it's sovereignty a few times, most notably in late fifties when the Dalai Lama was forced to flee Tibet and live in Northern India where he resides to this day. That is when he's not traveling the world as it's foremost advocate of non-violence.It is sad that this film did not get more box office than it did. Brad Pitt, David Thewlis, director Jean Jacques Arnaud are all persona non grata in the People's Republic of China for making this film. Quite a market indeed to be shut out of for a stand for humanity.It's to be hoped that one day the Tibetans will be free. Until then they have their unique brand of Buddhism to sustain them and this wonderful film to tell their story.

It takes place in very few places, has only a few main characters, and the whole movie just seemed really small, which turns out to be a good thing. You really get to know and love every character, no matter how much they have to say. The order by which the character's are introduced are quite odd, where the first 1\/3rd of the film is about Jerry Lundegaard (Macy) and his wife's set-up kidnap by Carl (Buscemi) and Gaear (Stormare). The last 2\/3rds are about Marge Gunderson (McDormand), a police officer, trying to solve three murders in the process of kidnapping Jerry's wife. The whole film I was glued to the screen, and when it ended, I kind of went Oh. It's not a tricky film to follow, it doesn't have any interesting plot twists or any amazing ending, it's just a wonderfully written, directed and acted simple film, that instead of ending with a big bang shoot 'em up, ends with more of a simple and effective whimper.My rating **** out of ****. 93 mins.

This upsets his girlfriend, Vanessa, who works hard and longs for marriage, family and a solid future. Thinking he is about to lose her affections, Sonny grabs at the chance to adopt a young boy dropped off at his doorstep. If he shows Vanessa he is good father material, perhaps she will stay with him. It doesn't work! Vanessa bolts with a 60-something man who, as she notes, has a five year plan. Sonny, therefore, has to learn to take care of the little lad himself, something totally alien to his existence. His parental care is unorthodox, to say the least, as Sonny's version of a night light is a glowing beer marquee. Nevertheless, the two of them learn from each other, in a positive way. At an outing in the park, the little boy even helps gain the attentions of an attractive female lawyer named Layla (Joey Lauren Adams). But, what will children's services say when they find out Sonny is not really the boy's father? This is one of Sandler's best films. His gross-out humor and facial expressions are still present but his love for the new little boy in his life is real and touching. The rest of the cast is an absolute dream, with Adams, Leslie Mann, Rob Schneider, and especially Jon Stewart, doing great jobs at their respective roles. The NYC setting, costumes, direction and production are very nice, indeed. Do you want easy laughs (sometimes a bit raunchy) and offbeat humor in a film but still welcome romance and darling children in the same view? Hey, daddy-o, you could hardly do better than this movie. It's many facets make it prime material for almost any group and its humor is very infectious.

The premise is that a man, dying of AIDS, has decided to throw an all-out party where he will announce that he will commit suicide. An engaging extrovert, he displays the frenetic optimism precisely found in manic-depressives or people who tend to carry a load with stoic abandon until they no longer can carry it by themselves. Of course, this movie never bothers to truly dive in deep into Nick Stark's (Eric Roberts) psyche -- all we know is what we know and we're given some access into his past via flashbacks, but even then, they only serve as a point of reference, never as a true picture. And then, predictably, his ultimate decision, which is so ridiculous that I wondered if Nick wasn't really a woman pretending to be a man. Talk about a tragic heroine! At least Lee Remick has more to do as his mother, and oddly enough, the movie totally forgets about her and chooses instead to concentrate solely on the mechanics of the party, Nick's botched relationship with Brandon (Gregory Harrison) who left him when he learned of Nick's illness and has come to (maybe?) make amends, and scenes that spell Cute and Tender all the way. I didn't buy it then, I still don't buy it now, and I certainly can't recommend a movie where a gay man decides that the best way to go is with a bang, even at the expense of family members and close friends. That's the ultimate act of selfishness, even if this is only a story. There will be some sentimentalists out there who will weep their eyes out at the sole mention of this pile of dreck, but not me.

Even if you know what's coming, the creepy feeling of the terror closing in is still freakishly intense.I love the contrast between the colourful 70's fashion (bell bottoms, flashy shirts, crazy sideburns) and the deadly surrounding and also not knowing what's about to happen to them.What this movie has which the other sequels lack is a sense of realism like we get to know the characters before they meet they're fates. When the horror kicks in, it's brutal and exhausting. We have the seemingly never-ending chasing-scene where poor heroine Marilyn Burns is followed by the furious Leatherface through the woods, in the house and through the woods again. Without Hooper's excellent direction this scene would die after a minute or so, but it has Leatherface so close onto Burns that you're glued to the seat and praying the she'll get away.The acting is top notch, Marylin Burns (Sally) truly gave a believable performance as the lead heroine, Paul A Partian (Franklin) plays the annoying wheelchair bound brother excellently, Edwin Neal (Hitchiker) gave me shivers every time I saw him especially the van scene he's maybe a bit too believable as a psycho. Jim Siedow (Old Man) gives a deranged, unpredictable performance and last but not least Gunner Hansen as Leatherface himself gives a rather startling performance as the chainsaw wielding psychopath.Despite there not being much gore, this movie packs a punch with really tense scenes like when Leatherface drags a doomed girl through the house and hangs her on the meat hook, I can only imagine the pain and torture she's suffered and the most brutal murder of all Franklin murdered with the chainsaw defenceless in his wheelchair, and the scary invited to dinner scene with Marylin Burns as the psycho family's guest.All in all this isn't just another run of the mill Slasher it's a masterpiece in film making.

I do fully agree with the comment of grendel-37 made in 2001, though the only part i have a different opinion is the ending of the film. I believe, there enough hint given as what happen To Bateman, it is what he chooses to do! Because his layer HAS BEEN IN London that night when he killed his competing colleague; in fact he was not! And that explains that he is not going in jail for his murders! And this ending is anxious for Bateman, because he just had a catharsis and now when is going to be the next one!? And i think that terrifies him, as he acknowledges it in some movie sequence!And I do thoroughly, completely agree that the Directing is stunning... One more thing that entirely blew me away was camera work! Hitchkogian Cinematography! Brilliant! ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"6 March 2007","score":"5 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" I saw this first in the theatre, it didn't stay too long, so I was lucky. For the life of me I don't understand how these movies don't get the publicity they deserve. Saint Ralph comes to mind, C.R.A.Z.Y., and the Hanging Garden et al. Lovely homegrown efforts with a story line and casting and the kind of breathtaking scenery that doesn't leave your mind for a while.This is eccentric in the extreme, you wonder where it is going from the outset when a woman leaves a little local museum in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, screaming her head off.The story unwinds charmingly and tragically. Helena Bonham Carter sinks her teeth into the role of the sniffling Margaret, all quirky and saucy who captures the heart of the drunken ex-miner bagpiper extraordinaire and Gaelic aficionado, Neil Currie, played by the devilish Clive Russell. Sparks fly, some highly erotic bits between the two. Kate Nelligan as Margaret's mother, plays a hardnosed sarcastic and bitter woman who has lost her husband and a son to the mines and is caring for her elderly father who can't breathe for the coal dust in his lungs.I won't spoil the story, it winds to its sad and shocking conclusion in its own time, suffice to say that there are many lovely side bits ( a blossoming love story between Margaret's young brother and the daughter of the manager of the mine being one).8 out of 10. Supporting cast and music were wonderful. A few little story holes that were slightly annoying - an uncle supposedly out on bail for arson back in his old job lickety split and a grandchild that had disappeared - but not enough to detract from an overall fine film. Even the second time around!
