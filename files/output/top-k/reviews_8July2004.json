This is without doubt the most sexually explicit and graphically violent mainstream film I have ever seen in my life.With sex scenes on par with your real hardcore porn movies, featuring penetrative sex, mouth to genital contact and ejaculation images and violence so bloody as to be disturbing and sickening, I have to question the purpose of this film from beginning to end.Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the film very much and it was well acted throughout, but I can't help but feel that the boundaries were extended a tad too much. Some might call it gritty realism which indeed it is, but others may argue with equal justification that this is nothing more than gratuitous sex and violence for gratuitous sex and violence sake in order to shock and appall to purposely course the controversy surrounding it in an effort to boost it's ratings.I am not a prude, and enjoy erotica as much as the next person, but when you are faced with a rape scene so harrowing and disturbing you start to feel that your almost watching some sort of snuff movie.Although the sex scenes are the factor which stand out most the violence plays a key role although it is not explained fully why they decide to commit such senseless acts of murder.As far as I could make out, they did it purely for kicks and thoroughly enjoyed it too. Again violence for violence sake.Many people have likened this film to a sort of Thelma and Louise gone bad, but it is directed in such a way that apart from the two main characters and their circumstances the comparisons end.In Thelma and Louise, you sympathize with them and end up rooting them on and you overlook their crimes because you know they are really good people at heart. With this film however, their perversity and love of killing fails in every way to get me on their side and I spent most of the movie looking forward to the day these two homicidal maniacs are caught and punished.There have been many films depicting murder and rape. In the days of the Hayes office, rape only had to be suggested to have got the message across. Did we really have to be subjected to that nightmare inducing depravity to convince us of what was going on? I think not.All they have done is to turn our attentions away from what is at heart a very good story.

Just look at the message board and the comments on this website. It's amazing how much people have taken from this movie, especially a relatively lesser known one.When I first watched this movie, it was a revelation. It was just that good of a movie. The characters, the story, the location all of it was just perfect.Many people have related to this movie because of its coming-of-age or just out of high school aspect, and they are true in describing this movie in those terms. But what I really thought was great was how this movie, to me, was about the search for something meaningful and more importantly for Enid, something real, especially more so in our often contrived and plastic modern world.That's where Ghost World comes in. It is described as so because if you look at the setting of the movie, you can not really tell where in the United States it takes place in. It could be virtually any one of the suburban areas that has sprung up in the past couple of decades. It's true that there is a great deal of comfort and leisure, but at the same time there is a lack of soul. Its not the big city, where they try to emulate its culture and activities, nor the small town, where they try to emulate its sense of tranquility and community, but rather a facade of both, ending up being none. No one is truly happy, yet everyone puts a smile on, and that is what really bothers Enid, I believe. Its a world where sterile hip-hop music is used to celebrate a high school graduation, authentic 50s diners are anything but, and a white blues band sing about picking cotton all day long for the man. All contrived, all far removed from its source, all as real as a slushie from the Sidewinder food store.After all why is she attracted to Seymour? I don't think because he's the dorky record collector with a sour outlook on life, but because he is honest about it. He's not a stuffy collector who claims to know everything, but a guy with a passion for something, even if it isn't something cool. Even with the Coon Chicken incident you can see that its sincerity that Enid is searching for. Enid is not a racist but she picks the Coon Chicken ad for her art project because it reflects how little society has have not changed, even if it whitewashed itself. Like Seymour said people still hate each other but they hide it better.Rebecca on the other hand seems to have accepted that society and life at large kinda sucks, so she sells out by working at the coffee shop, which is an obvious Starbuck's knock off. But in my opinion, she just realized that she can't change the world and how it is, so she goes on a different road from Enid's. A scene which highlights this is when she shows a liking for brightly colored glasses for her new apartment, while Enid gawks at her for being overtly excited for cups. But who's to say that Rebecca is wrong for liking those cups? How is it different from Seymour's fascination of 75s? Rebecca may have changed some throughout the movie, but at her core she remains to be the cynical and independent person that she is.Finally, Enid goes away from it all, fulfilling her desire to one day to disappear from it all, because it seems that she can not rely on anyone, not even Norman the bus bench guy. Rebecca is working most of the time, her father is marrying the person she dreads (showing a disinterest or plain aloofness in Enid's life), her art teacher is a talentless hack who doesn't really care for her (or any of her students really, even though she pretends to) since she didn't fight for her after the art show debacle and Seymour disappointed her twice. First by dating a person whom he knows is not his type, yet he conforms to her (literally, just look at those tight jeans she bought him!) and secondly becoming overtly renewed in his relationship with Enid only after a night where Enid and Seymour took their relationship to bed(with a help of a bottle of champagne.Did Enid commit suicide in the end? Personally I don't think so, it would be such a surrealistic end to a story that is steeped in realism, but that is another reason why Ghost World is such a great movie. There is such an open space for interpretation and such depth that one can talk about it for hours, discussing about it and getting more out it with every viewing of the movie. There's a whole lot more than what I just wrote about, but I don't want to bore you with my interpretation, and there are other things in the movie that other people see in it that I might have missed or disagree with.But thats a mark of a good movie.

It was almost black and white - hard light that we just don't see here. It didn't look like a studio, or Mexico (or even Coober Pedy!).Thirdly, we were presented with a 'holy man' who was not a standard Christian eccentric or magically endowed Indian Guru. A plain simple Muslim Iman who lived by his beliefs but didn't attempt to murder, terrorize or convert anyone, nor attempt to exorcise the monster devils, nor to worship them. Just an example of one of the worlds population in the wrong place at the wrong time. So I think it was an interesting film, but not for the usual reasons. Not for the plot which was predictable, not for the writing (which mostly was adequate) and not for the effects (which were relatively unimpressive). No, I 'liked' the film because I could really believe it was another planet, because I could believe in the creatures (till I saw them!) and because it highlighted that the things we *are* afraid of, may not necessarily be the things we *should* be worrying about.

Not to mention treating drug offenders with compassion rather than condemnation?Some may completely disagree with my stance, but the way I see it, it's an impossible idea that it can be won in the ways in which we have already tried. Get rid of the profit, get rid of the crime and criminals. This would mean all recreational drugs would have to become legal, and in turn purified and protected by our government like normal prescription drugs. It'd be harder for young people to get them that way, they'd be safer, and there wouldn't be people killing each other over them because the market would be gone. Likely? Probably not, but it's because I don't think we're mature enough as a people for this idea to come to fruition yet. And in the end, what business is it of yours what I decide to put into my body as long as it doesn't hurt another human being on this planet? None of your f-ing business! End of f-ing story.As for the film, complete mastery in all departments. The cinematography is simply beautiful and entirely fitting. The scenes in Mexico have a gritty feel to them and are dominated by orange and yellow hues, which is further complimented by the gritty, shaky feel of the camera. The political and family scenes, in which Michael Douglas appears in, have a much more subdued and soft feel to them and are dominated by blue hues. This is meant to display opposite spectrums of the war, the war that both fronts are fighting in futility, just in different ways.  I think this is also portrayed in the drug dealer scenes, featuring Catherine Zeta-Jones, and her drug lord husband. These scenes are displayed in regular color resembling the real `traffic' of the film. At least that's my opinion.The cast is second to none and I especially enjoyed Benicio Del Toro here, as he's entirely convincing as the torn Mexican policeman. He more than deserved his Oscar. The acting and ensemble cast is, overall, nothing short of perfect. But the direction, screenplay, and editing are what really make the movie unique and interesting besides it's amazing message and undoubtedly deserved the three Academy Awards it received in those departments. Soderbergh really catches the eye here and will no doubt be a force to be reckoned with in his future films. Many directors have recently tried splitting up scene presentation to keep the audience entertained and many have failed. This is certainly not one of those films.Excellent and extremely entertaining cinema about a very important issue in today's society, and with a powerful message to boot. Very highly recommended.

There's one problem though American Beauty is one of the best films of all time. Life as a House is one of the worst films of all time. Life is a watered down, less extreme version of American Beauty. It's for the teenagers whose parents won't let them watch American Beauty. And why not? It has an up-and-coming teen heartthrob who can't act worth two tomatoes (Hayden Christensen), an older star that can draw older audiences (Kevin Kline), a bunch of random B-list actors, and someone who deserves better than this type of movie (Jena Malone).George (Kline) is just fired from his job as an architect (where he supposedly designed hundreds of great buildings-then why does he live in a normal house in suburbia?) who is diagnosed with some sort of cancer. He decides to build a house with his estranged Goth son Sam (Christensen) during his last few months. Within a few days, their relationship turns around and they both work on the house. That's it. That's a pretty exciting two hours, isn't it?The thing in this movie that annoyed me the most was the constant barrage of morals. They had no real place in the movie, and they just kept being thrown at us. Director Irwin Winkler goes with the crap against the wall theory-throw enough crap against the wall and some will stick. That's not the case here. Nothing sticks. What's even worse is that they don't even follow with the morals they introduce. For example, George tells Sam how change is gradual and you might not even realize it. In the next scene, Sam's a completely different (normal) person. That's not that gradual, if I'm not mistaken. A mistake that was made was billing this as a dramedy. It could be considered a drama, but it's not funny unless you laugh at a naked boy being nervous around a naked girl or people talking about the stench of their fecal material. I thought this was supposed to be an adult drama. Nope, I'm getting this confused with American Beauty again.So if this man's final dream is to build a house with his son, why, as the movie's going towards its denouement, EVERYONE FROM THE FREAKING NEIGHBORHOOD IS BUILDING THE HOUSE FOR HIM! This architectural genius, whose final dream is to build a house by himself (and his son), is being done for him. And he's not even upset! He might not have been able to finish it, but that's not the point. The point is that it's shoddy writing by Mark Andrus. More foul balls on the writer's court Sam's change is uncalled for. George tells him a sob story about how his dad used to beat him, and then Sam has some sort of mental epiphany and wants to help his dad. Every single character is underdeveloped. Who is this George guy? Why should we care if\/when he dies or not? Have we seen anything previously that should make us like him? And instead of making us feel sorry for Sam, I became angry at my namesake. I understand what it's like to be a teenager (I am one), and moodswings are common, but man, what a jerk!

Hew Morgan, as an old man, remembers the Welsh mining village (and valley) of his youth, particularly the strike which divided his family, the girl who he fell in love with and married his older brother, and his beautiful sister (Maureen O'Hara) and her thwarted love for the decent preacher Mr Gruffydd (Walter Pigeon).Another work of nostalgia and sentiment from John Ford. Naive and simplified, but intentionally. Ford knew he was calling up a bygone age, with a campness and naivety to go with it, a bit like Selznick did with Gone with the Wind, and indeed many movies did at this time. Moviegoers at this time were nothing like the antiquated Welsh characters in period garb we have here. This called for just as much escapsim from them as it does for us - but, if you like, moviegoers were used to the characters not resembling themselves back then.But the greatest treats are for film buffs - How Green Was My Valley is a stunning work visually. I don't know that i would have given it the Oscar above Citizen Kane, but everyone knows the esablishment rewards people who do what is expected, but do it really well (John Ford) instead of people who wrapped up all their old tricks and delivered it to them in a beast they didn't recognise (Orson Welles). Its ironic, actually, that these two should be competing this year for Best Picture, because watching some of Ford's pre-Orson Welles flicks, you can tell that, like Orson told us, he did take the ceiling from Stagecoach. Ford did invent the ceiling in cinema. You can see it in Young Mr Lincoln as well, 2 years before Kane, Ford's compositions where actors are framed against the ceiling of a room.Don't ever believe John Ford when he tells you he was just a workman, doing his business well. He was a poet. This work is pure poetry.9\/10. It lost a mark b.c Roddy McDowell, in the role that made him a child star, shall we say, really really improved with age.

It was actually the first film released in the year 1970.  Altman was a nobody (movie-wise) and this was his only hit, if you can believe it.  It was set in The Korean War, but really was about the Vietnam War (I think everybody caught on to that, back then). Altman's style of improv, zoom lenses, non-famous actors in lead roles, off-beat music, etc. made him an enemy of the establishment back then, and he was already in his mid-40's (like who cares, right; a lot of people cared back then).  Anyway, this film in January of 1970 rocked people on their heels (a comedy), whether you were a Love or leave it conservative or a left-wing liberal or young, but it hit people right in the face with a laugh (bloody as it turned out).  There were no stars - the leads (D. Sutherland and E. Gould) were respected actors, but not mainstage).  This film came out at the perfect time (and actually hurt the film Catch-22, unintentionally, because of timing.  Forget that horrifying hit TV show in the 70's and 80's, I guess, that pampered everything away; even to the right-wing.  Sutherland, who had previously played retards, villains, and ghosts didn't even get along with Altman, but became a major actor because of this.  E.

Robert Duvall was already a respected actor since the early 60's, but basically considered a character actor.

This mock on too many horrifying war situations showed humanity, which didn't mesh with Spiro Agnew-type people at that time (and The President; the one who resigned).  It was pro-life and pro-choice, and hilarious!  Great characters; drama when necessary, but mostly hip jokes about people and timing.  Great opening song (used by that TV show), wonderful cinematography, Oscar-winning script, perfect acting (IN A WAR COMEDY)!.

Disney's first major feature, the grand debut, cements the major features of those to come. It draws from very dark but fantastic material, Grimm's Fairy Tales, and alternates scenes of evocative darkness (the Queen's castle, the man sent to cut Snow White's heart out, and the forest that's alive, are some brilliant examples) with scenes of superlative cuteness and song and dance numbers.DrawbacksThere are some beautiful compositions, but the movement of the animation is not as fluid as it would become, even with Pinnochio, Disney's very next feature. Plus, the singing styles are very 1930's opera-style. I can see why i always used to just think of songs during musicals as things i had to wait through till the story got going again - its because almost every song in Snow White doesn't advance the story. Great musical numbers, like the ones in West Side Story, do. They don't feel like we're just waiting around. When most of the Snow White songs come on, the story gets put on hold.Snow White is too naive, plain and perfect a character to hold our interest these days.

I thought Sylvester played an OK role, not as good as the other Rocky's though but the performances of Talia Shire, Burt Young and Dolph Lundgren (hope is spelled it right) were great. I did think it a bit strange how Apollo can die inside of 2 rounds yet Rocky can go the distance....win and come out of it OK. The music was great and I liked how they show both gloves at the beginning with the Eye of the Tier playing in the background. Again this was another great Rocky film GO ROCKY!

Very rarely are there any great fantasy films. There are good ones or average ones that can merely get by on their looks. I do love the fact that fantasy films can paint such vivid and imaginative picturesque settings. As an example look at Legend. That was one of the best looking films ever made but the content of the film was not great. It was poorly scripted with hokey dialogue and a storyline aimed at 5 year olds, with creatures and effects that would scare the pants off younger children. Now you look at the best ones and the rare ones that can be called classics with greats of other genres like Lord Of The Rings and in a more Sci-fi orientation, Star Wars. City Of The Lost C children is a French fantasy aimed at a more mature audience member, from 15 up really. It looks fantastic. The sets, the costumes, the effects, the cinematography turn this 15 million dollar film into something looking far more epic and majestic in scope. Jean Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro take joint plaudits and credit as directors, Jeunut more responsible visually and Caro for the character and story. This is endlessly imaginative and immensely enjoyable and is very quirky.The story centres around a mad scientist, Krank, who is unable to dream, because of this he is aging quickly and is old beyond his year. He grows insane and has developed a technique to view and capture children's dreams so he can thereby inject them into his own mind. He kidnaps children from the nearby village and brings them to his lair, a king of oilrig in the middle of surrounding sea. He is aided by his brothers who are four identical clones of each other, unfortunately they all suffer from narcolepsy. Krank himself is a clone. His father who created them is now merely a brain in a tank and Krank was an unfortunate mistake who doesn't dream. The only clone who was right is an enigma called the original who has long since escaped the insanity of this evil lair only to be living underwater and a kind of insane junk collector. One day strong man, One, and his little brother are ambushed by Krank's men and One's little brother is kidnapped. Thus far Krank's captives have proved unsuccessful in his quest for a cure, because they all suffer terrible nightmares, partly due to his own nastiness. All this latest young victim responds to is food, he seems to have no fear and it seems he could be the one, just as long as Krank keeps feeding him. One sets out on a quest to find his brother meeting Miete, a young a troublesome orphan girl in the process. It's all good fun this film and while the story is simplistic it's a kind of delightfully Grimm fairytale sort of story that keeps your interest.The cast are great. Ron Perlman is one of those cult actors who everyone seems to like and he has hit it big with the recent success Hellboy. He is a strong presence and unlike many musclemen of his stature he can act, something which has held him back somewhat because people have never really cast him as a leading action man, although in truth he's not blessed with good looks. The interestingly named Rufus, a Juenet stalwart is also very good as the clones, while Daniel Emilfork is excellent as Crank. Also good and a charming innocence is Judith Vittet as Miette. Anyone who loves a visually stunning movie should watch this film it looks amazing. The sets, the impressionistic and exaggerated designs are brilliant. It is typically French in it's verve. This is a fantasy fans wet dream, believe me! ****  ","genre":null},{"date":"8 July 2004","score":"60 out of 70 people found the following review useful","review":"  I'm a fan of fantasy films.

This was the best work I have seen her do to this point.

Their chemistry was terrific and the story was riveting and the dancing awesome (both the ballet and the dancing throughout the movie.)

I'm not going to comment on the politics or history of the war, because obviously a lot of other people know much more about these issues than I do. But as a piece of cinema, and as a comment on war in general, the film is superb.Certainly the battle scenes were some of the most gruesome ever filmed. Perhaps they were over the top, but surely they are more true than the old movies where everybody died cleanly, with a minimum of pain, and frequently had time to speak their last will and testament before they signed out by closing their eyes.What I loved was the human dimension. Some critics have complained about the depiction of men having babies just before they go to war and get killed, but the fact is that it happened. After all, these were young men, many of them were married, and it was the time of the baby boom. I loved the intercutting between the battle field and the women back home. Sure it was excessively emotional, but if you can't get emotional about the waste of lives in war, then I think you have a serious problem. It was also great to see them humanise the enemy, particularly in the bit about the man who was killed after writing a letter to his wife or girlfriend. Is this racist? Don't be absurd.Is it propaganda? Well, it seems that if you disagree with the views expressed in a book or film, it is propaganda, while if you agree, it is honest, probing, important, etc.  I certainly didn't agree with all the opinions expressed in We Were Soldiers. I think the policy of sending men to their deaths in order to bring back the bodies of those already dead is insanity, and I don't believe the use of napalm is ever justified. But this movie is not in any sense propaganda. It is possibly unrealistic in the sense that it is dramatised, not documentary, but it is a very honest portrayal of real men and women trying to cope with a real, ghastly situation.
