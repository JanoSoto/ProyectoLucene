[{"date":"18 January 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I liked The Iron Giant, I liked it a lot. The film, surely, has to be recognised as one of the last, great two dimensional animated films that the Americans made at the back end of an era. If we formally acknowledge that the new 'era' of animation is, or was, from 1999 onwards predominantly three dimensional from an American perspective, then this is the last great film of that time. Here is an animated film that does not rely on purely the visual, even if they are as impressive as they need to be and opts for story telling and emotional involvement more than anything else. Sprinkle on a little bit of Cold War paranoia and you have The Iron Giant, a period set character study of a human being and a creature not of this world.The film is one of which it is difficult to not just sit there, and stare in both wonder but more importantly appreciation at what's being presented to you. While both colourful and atmospheric, I was most impressed with director Brad Bird's attention to character detail when it came to the animation. It's the little things; the way in which the Iron Giant himself moves around in the manner in which he does. The Iron Giant is big and hulking but its presence is juxtaposed with the very fragile and delicate relationship he has with a young boy, who is established to be pretty desperate for a friend or companion early on. The Giant's presence and traits are comparable to the only villainous character of the piece, an F.B.I. agent who's grossly smaller than The Giant but seems more threatening despite the height difference and jolts about in an urgent and jittery manner giving off an entirely different feeling to that of the large, lumbering but friendly robot.Bird's work here reminded me of Nick Park's Wallace and Gromit series, a series which I feel has since partly been inspired by The Iron Giant. There is that knowing feeling behind the production; that setting in the past and that referencing to what the filmmaker enjoys or grew up enjoying, indeed The Iron Giant's tag-line is 'It came from outer space!', maybe a nod to Hollywood science fiction films of the 1950s and 60s that dealt with the fear of impending Communist-related invasions. The link is uncanny &#150; a giant robot the most antagonistic character of the film, believed to be Russian, sent to 'the good ol' U.S.A.' in order to destroy the nation from within.The hero of the title is a nine year old boy named Hogarth Hughes (Marienthal) and lives with his mother Annie (Aniston) and in a desperate attempt to prolong some sort of relationship with another being other than his mother, he brings home little animals not exactly fit for household domestication. The establishment introduces this fact and acts as a good introduction to post-modern artist, working in a time not ready for the post-modern, Dean McCoppin (Connick Jr.) who's a friend and ally for them later on. After some other initial events, a large robot voiced by Vin Diesel, who merely has to supply some grunts and other such noises that eventually turn into synthesised words, comes into contact with Hogarth and they strike up a friendship following a train-wreck.Enter F.B.I. agent Kent Mansley, played by Christopher McDonald in the sort of slimy role you'd associate with him, in all his paranoid glory. I think initially, we don't really mind if Mansley gets his prize. He makes some enquiries and asks about but he's just doing his job. We know about as much about it as he does and it hasn't really earned its place in our hearts but it's not until Bird brilliantly brings together both the Giant's friendship with the boy and Kent's gradual obsession with the capturing of the robot until we veer more into a thought process that demands we don't want to see him get his man.Echoing what Bird sets up at the beginning, The Giant acts as a fatherly figure for Hogarth; wearing a constant smile on his face and vastly becoming one of the friendliest non-human components to a relationship involving children we've seen on screen. From the Cold War era sci-fi films of the 1950s onwards to Spielberg's E.T. and Cameron's second Terminator film, the referencing and inspirations flow and flow. Additionally, the other feelings I got amidst all this harked way back to comedy of the silent era and the use of heartfelt music and shots of character's reactions while humorous exchanges were played out &#150; it seems Bird's knowledge and love of cinema-past knows no end.Despite this phenomenon of a giant robot landing on Earth and a child taking a likening to it, the film looks at the identity of the robot more than it does anyone else. As a grey and hulking thing, is possesses neither the colour to place it into any particular category nor the necessary intelligence to place it within another. What reminded me of the second Terminator film apart from the obvious fatherly connotations was the scene in which the boy teaches it the difference between good and evil, and the poor kid uses all the facilities available to him, which peak at mere comic books, to give this creature some sort of identity and how he can be 'good' like Superman instead of 'bad' like the typical 'destroy the world' aliens &#150; perhaps a reference to more recent blockbusters like Independence Day which rely on flashy visuals, hostile aliens and zero logic. The Iron Giant is the opposite of this and is vastly superior. Towards the end, there is one lump in the throat moment and I don't think the immediate ending does the film a disservice. The Iron Giant is truly a special animation for children and adults alike.

What if he married your sister? What if his ego was as big as Montana and at the same time as fragile as glass? How could you ever repay him? How could you ever resolve these questions? Ask Hal Hartley. Or see his movie.This independent seriocomedy opens by studying a generally bungling garbageman named Simon Grim. He soon makes perhaps the first friend he's ever made in his life with Henry Fool, a sharply droll scoundrel, though a failure as an author. Henry's giant ego, what with his delusions of literary genius and grandeur, not to mention his comparison between his pedophilia and that of Socrates, justifies his wily, prose-like lines. Henry incidentally exposes Simon to the life of literature, who then writes a profoundly staggering poem, as we judge by the reactions of all who come across even a few lines of it. As Simon is swept up on his rise to the prestigious apex of the most talked-about underground poet in the world, Henry's own endeavors at recognition merely bring about unpleasant dismissal by the very publisher who commits with Simon to issue his already legendary poem.Hartley is a very personal filmmaker. I particularly like a director whose film is entirely owned by him or her, especially one with an unlikely extensive running time like this one. Because his script is entirely his own, and created from scratch, he has actors suggest more than they divulge. Simon is a great poet because of how socially bound he is, never speaking or changing his expression and thus always looking inward, much like great poets have, like Rilke for instance.Hartley wisely doesn't show the poem or the confessions over which Henry has long toiled. Whether they are good or bad depends on the histrionics of the outside story. They are almost the classic mystery items in so many thrillers and pulpy crime pictures, but to a much superior effect. They are not subsidiary, but vital.

They have two children, a lavish condo and a large stable of servants. Alice spends her days shopping, getting manicures and pedicures, and so on. However, she's not very happy, and in searching for the reason for her unhappiness she has become a bit of a hypochondriac. When she finally goes to see an acupuncturist, Dr. Yang (Keye Luke), on several friends' advice because her back is bothering her, he tells her that her problem is in her head, not her back. Through his extremely unorthodox treatments, Alice gradually transforms her life.This is a Woody Allen film, but Woody doesn't appear in it. It focuses on Mia throughout, with various literary allusions, mostly to Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865), but also in ways to A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens (1843) in the way ghosts and memories from the past arrive to deliver their epiphanies. Alec Baldwin is a former lover with a brief turn as one such ghost. Though Woody isn't in the film, and it is all about Alice (or Mia Farrow, as the case may be) it is as if he is speaking through all of the characters, as the unseen scribe behind the scenes, the author of the drama. Alice considers writing, but is clearly not cut out for it. Nancy Brill (Cybill Shepherd), a supposed friend (frenemy?), has a job reading scripts for a television network, but even with the help of her own personal muse (Bernadette Peters) she can't get a break. The muse points out that she can't expect any help from Brill, who constantly glances at her watch at all their meetings. Her writing teacher says she has talent.Muse (explaining what the Professor means when he tells Alice she's 'deep') Very deep is exactly where he wants to put it.Bernadette Peters' muse is a mixture of creative juices, insight, and down-to-earth truth. I almost thought we had fast-forwarded to the Greek chorus of Mighty Aphrodite for a minute. It was like The Muse was inserted for Woody to tell Mia that she should stick to acting, and leave the writing to him.The main metaphor of the movie is Dr. Yang, and his office functions as the looking glass through which Alice enters her Wonderland. He uses hypnosis, herbs, and magic potions. At one point, she barges in on him in the midst of an opium session. Is he the hookah smoking caterpillar? Yang would also seem to stand for the male principal, the compliment to Yin. Her life is out of balance, with no Yang to offset her Yin. Dr. Yang Love is a very complex emotion. No rational thought... much romance, but much suffering.Her husband, Doug, wants her to just play the wife role, but offers her neither love nor understanding. Doug(trying to tell Alice why she'd be good working part-time in a sweater store) You have a nice personality and you know sweaters. Dr. Yang encourages her to speak to a man she sees while they are both dropping off their kids at school. The man is a jazz musician (Joe Mantegna), a tenor sax player who is working on a tribute to Duke Ellington. Though we never get to see or hear him actually play, he appears to be a solid professional on the New York jazz scene. Joe (explaining to Alice why he wants to have an affair with her) There's nothing sexier than a lapsed Catholic.Though she flirts with him, he isn't really the answer to her dilemma. She is almost going through Freudian analysis, searching her past for answers to her present.Alice But then when dad died you drank yourself to death with, with margaritas. Alice's Mother I couldn't help it darling. You know I couldn't resist the taste of salt around the rim of a glass.As in most of Allen's films, music plays a big part, especially jazz. At one point Alice, after hypnosis, is brazenly flirting with the jazz musician, asking astute questions about his reeds (he uses #3) and making references to the whole world of harmonics that opened up when John Coltrane switched from Tenor to Soprano Saxophone. Woody Allen is a clarinet player himself, and especially fond of traditional jazz. The opening song, used as an ongoing musical motif, is Lime House Blues. Though not technically a blues, this old-time jazz tune has stood the test of time, and was still being covered, for instance, by Coltrane, well into the post bop jazz era. It also works well as a bluegrass tune. Oh, Lime House Kid, Oh-oh-oh, Lime House Kid. Going the way that the rest of them did. Poor broken blossom, and nobody's child. Haunting and taunting, you're just kind of wild.

Her writing teacher says she has talent.Muse (explaining what the Professor means when he tells Alice she's 'deep') Very deep is exactly where he wants to put it.Bernadette Peters' muse is a mixture of creative juices, insight, and down-to-earth truth. I almost thought we had fast-forwarded to the Greek chorus of Mighty Aphrodite for a minute. It was like The Muse was inserted for Woody to tell Mia that she should stick to acting, and leave the writing to him.The main metaphor of the movie is Dr. Yang, and his office functions as the looking glass through which Alice enters her Wonderland. He uses hypnosis, herbs, and magic potions. At one point, she barges in on him in the midst of an opium session. Is he the hookah smoking caterpillar? Yang would also seem to stand for the male principal, the compliment to Yin. Her life is out of balance, with no Yang to offset her Yin. Dr. Yang Love is a very complex emotion. No rational thought... much romance, but much suffering.Her husband, Doug, wants her to just play the wife role, but offers her neither love nor understanding. Doug(trying to tell Alice why she'd be good working part-time in a sweater store) You have a nice personality and you know sweaters. Dr. Yang encourages her to speak to a man she sees while they are both dropping off their kids at school. The man is a jazz musician (Joe Mantegna), a tenor sax player who is working on a tribute to Duke Ellington. Though we never get to see or hear him actually play, he appears to be a solid professional on the New York jazz scene. Joe (explaining to Alice why he wants to have an affair with her) There's nothing sexier than a lapsed Catholic.Though she flirts with him, he isn't really the answer to her dilemma. She is almost going through Freudian analysis, searching her past for answers to her present.Alice But then when dad died you drank yourself to death with, with margaritas. Alice's Mother I couldn't help it darling. You know I couldn't resist the taste of salt around the rim of a glass.As in most of Allen's films, music plays a big part, especially jazz. At one point Alice, after hypnosis, is brazenly flirting with the jazz musician, asking astute questions about his reeds (he uses #3) and making references to the whole world of harmonics that opened up when John Coltrane switched from Tenor to Soprano Saxophone. Woody Allen is a clarinet player himself, and especially fond of traditional jazz. The opening song, used as an ongoing musical motif, is Lime House Blues. Though not technically a blues, this old-time jazz tune has stood the test of time, and was still being covered, for instance, by Coltrane, well into the post bop jazz era. It also works well as a bluegrass tune. Oh, Lime House Kid, Oh-oh-oh, Lime House Kid. Going the way that the rest of them did. Poor broken blossom, and nobody's child. Haunting and taunting, you're just kind of wild. And the lyrics fit because the song talks about going to China Town, such as Alice is going to Dr. Yang's. &#133;rings for your fingers and tears for your crown, that is the story of old China Town.After much soul searching, Alice leaves her husband, who is cheating on her anyway, and devotes herself to charity, adopting multiple orphans. Who (besides Madonna or Angelina Jolie) does that sound like?

This horror\/comedy works on so many levels. From the excellent opening, with the return of Jason's nemesis Tommy digging up Jason's corpse to ensure his demise, to the James Bond spoof credit scene, the movie starts with a bang. Yes, even the lightening that inadvertently brings Jason back is a good show &#150; it flat out tells us what were in for a horror spoof that not only spoofs the previous 'Friday' films, but never once takes itself seriously. I love that in films ones that can acknowledge their own faults and refuse to take themselves at word. Including and after the opening, they get right to the point. All previous 'Friday' movies made us wait until the final 20 minutes or less to actually see the killer. Here, finally, we get to see Jason throughout. And he's in full force, now technically a monster with great strength and no hiding that he really can't be killed. That's part of the evidence 'Jason Lives' doesn't take itself too seriously; they know it's a sixth entry in a horror series and they know we all know what to expect, including Jason doesn't seem to die &#150; so why hide it? The movie has an excellent, ah hem, killer soundtrack, including Alice Cooper ('He's Back' is one of my all time favorite Cooper songs), funny dialogue and scenes (anyone wanna play paintball?), actual tense, scary and creative scenes\/kills despite its comedic tone throughout, decent acting and finally, 'Friday' brings the young kids to camp &#150; something many previous installments only talked about.

There is simply not a film like M (except, perhaps, for the uncalled-for remake); it is unique in every way From the storyline, the camera shots, the killer lines, the emotions involved and the audience's response. Also, there is something very odd about the film, which is the fact that this film does not contain any background music at all; creating an eerie feel to the film, and also it somewhat involves the audience into the film.After watching this film for the first time, I couldn't help but admire Fritz Lang's genius behind it. Especially more so, as this was his first sound film. But he even seemed to have mastered the art of sound films, as well!! And Peter Lorre's acting... this film was what made him recognised as an excellent actor. And it is evident; his acting seems natural (which is quite a worrying thought), and there could not have been a better performance from any other actor.If you are more of a fan of modern filming, I must warn it may seem very drawn out. Unlike modern filming, Fritz Lang's films tend to be very meticulous in the story details, which I personally think is a good point. Also, there is no 'real' on-screen violence; if you were expecting blood and violence, you will probably be disappointed; the art of German Expressionism in films (M is a G.Expressionist film) is that the horrors are subjective, which is what makes this film purely excellent.This film is simply unique.

Has he just witnessed a murder ?I'll admit straight off I have a problem with a lot of hippie sixties movies. I enjoy this one whenever I see it, but it's a typical example. Somebody came up with a great idea - what if a guy unintentionally photographed a murder - and then they completely fail to back that up with a believable or suspenseful story. Sixties filmmakers sometimes treated the conventions of cinema with disdain, rode the wave of cool at the time, but now their movies look weak. Okay, so there's a murder. When does it happen ? Presumably it must be while Hemmings and Redgrave are talking but there's no gunshot and the gun in the photo doesn't have a silencer. How does she find his studio ? How does she break in later to steal the film ? Why kill someone, leave their body in a public park for a day, hope nobody notices it and then remove it later ? All of this is stupid and makes no sense. Ah, say the purists, but the film is really playing with reality, symbolised by the mime's tennis match at the end. Cobblers to that - a murder plot is a murder plot. They put one in because it's exciting, but didn't have the talent to work out how to do it properly. Having said all this though, both the sequence in the park (which was shot at Maryon Park in Charlton in south-east London) and the scene where Hemmings develops the film are excellent, wordless, hypnotic, brilliantly filmed montages. The movie was shot by Carlo DiPalma (who made some great films with Woody Allen) and the photography works extremely well - it's tight, crisp and never descends into the shaky hand-held histrionics of many films of the period. Hemmings is good as the self-important snapper (inspired by David Bailey, an influential fashion photographer of the day), but both Redgrave and Miles are tedious, their stilted dialogue alternately pretentious and dull. Cultural fans can see sixties sexpot Birkin taking her clothes off, and very young uber-guitarists Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page playing with The Yardbirds. All in all, this movie succeeds better as a sixties timepiece I reckon, with its silly clothes and pot parties; to me it's a bit like the Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud III Hemmings drives - handsome and impressive but designed to exclude those not worthy enough, including me. Featuring music by jazz great Herbie Hancock. This movie won the Palme D'Or at Cannes, got two Oscar nominations and was lauded at every Film Arts festival. It was made the same year as Sergio Leone's Il Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo, which won sod all and was met with critical derision from cinema's establishment.

Not much more can be said about the 'Friday the 13th' series and after just a huge leap in 'Part VI,' Jason came back in 'Part VII &#150; The New Blood' to slash the creative team (and apparently the budget as well) and drag us, once again, below standards, even at any 'Friday' level. Simply more of the same, a rehash of 'III,' 'Final Chapter,' most of the other 'New' chapter 'A New Beginning,' but I'm guessing it's many more years after 'Part VI,' as Jason is shown trapped at the bottom of the lake &#150; where we left him in 'VI' &#150; and a young girl kills her father almost immediately overhead. She's now grown, as are her telekinesis powers, the same ones she used to murder her father (intentionally or not.) Decent twist to the old 'Friday' plots, but not as a whole, this film just rips off of the 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' films. Let's see the powergirl's name is Tina, (Nightmare 1), she looks\/acts like Patricia Arquette (Nightmare 3) and has super-powers like Alice (Nightmare 4.) The series needs to find more original names, as well, i.e. Tina, and when someone mistakes Jason for (another character) Michael ('Halloween,') it just seems tired by this stage. So, we have more of the same in 'Part VII' copied movies, copied names, characters we wish dead long before Jason gets to them, sex, too-hard attempts at creative kills and the usual Girl Vs. Jason finale. I will say this, 'VII' is worth watching for one reason only It was awesome watching someone kick Jason's butt. The whole fight between the girl's powers and Jason was worth actually baring through another clichéd 'Friday' film. Well, all but the laughable ending.

There are sweeping vistas, castles, teams of horses and loads of people all fighting at the same time. Yep, cool. Mel Gibson doesn't make any long lasting impression as Sir William Wallace, Scottish national hero in his country's fight for independence from English rule in the thirteenth century. But he is still Mel Gibson and this allows him to take a non-fiction based movie and beat the sense out of it when it comes to facts. I have to give Gibson some credit since it was his passion for the role that brought the movie into the sight of Hollywood and it gave Mel the chance to pull off the triple play - act, direct, produce. The film denied Mel is acting award on Oscar night, but the film did win five Academy Awards for Best Picture, Director, Cinematography, Makeup, and Sound Effects Editing.If you're a medieval fan, there is a sure bet you'll love this film. From castles and swords to kings and princesses, the film delivers a bit on all levels. Playing Wallace's nemesis in the movie by was of England's King Edward I, known as Longshanks is scene-stealing Patrick McGoohan (Secret Agent, The Prisoner). McGoohan makes Edward the perfect villain, a butcher willing to sacrifice any number of his own men to maintain his power. McGoohan's performance also contributed to making Gibson a villain in the eyes of much of the British movie going public, who felt that along with Gibson's The Patriot that he must be holding a grudge against them, unfairly giving a bad name to the country and its past. McGoohan's performance is excellent and while arguably award worthy, probably not egging the English on against Gibson all these centuries later.Braveheart does some twisting and turning and even throws the Princess (Sophie Marceau) into Wallace's arms for sex factor. But in the end we know where this film is headed. Gibson handles his 3 jobs well and in Braveheart turned out a film close enough to fact to look enough like fiction to make a really good film. ***\/****.The posters are fairly the same as the posters of The Patriot in that it seems to just be Gibson with flashes of the background behind him.

Siegel remembered it as his favorite film and its potency lies in Siegel's subtle handling of the outlandish subject matter. Every Siegel film before and after Invasion of the Body Snatchers has examined the theme of the individual versus society. Never has any Siegel protagonist ever blended in with the swarm. Iconoclastic to the hilt, Siegel's protagonists clash with the status quo. Siegel's respect for these outcasts prompted him to make Invasion of the Body Snatchers. I think that the world is populated by pods, he observed, and I wanted to show them. Despite its melodramatic title and ghoulish adversaries, Invasion of the Body Snatchers shares little similarity with sci-fi B-movies of the 1950s. Surprisingly, this minor Allied Artists release quickly acquired a reputation. Film critics and scholars alike have read considerably more into its standard narrative about aliens taking over the earth than Siegel intended. Kevin McCarthy said years later he saw no political significance in the plot. One of Don Siegel's contemporaries and a renowned film producer in his own right, Walter Mirish wrote about the film's significance in his autobiography. People began to read meanings into pictures that were never intended. The Invasion of the Body Snatchers is an example of that. I remember reading a magazine article arguing that the picture was intended as an allegory about the communist infiltration of America. From personal knowledge, neither Walter Wanger nor Don Siegel, who directed it, nor Dan Mainwaring, who wrote the script nor the original author Jack Finney, nor myself saw it as anything other than a thriller, pure and simple. Nevertheless, good works of art are always prone to interpretations beyond those of its creators, and Invasion of the Body Snatchers became a lightning rod for commentary. Three schools of thought emerged about Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The first construed it as a polemic against the hysteria-inducing tactics of discredited Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy who alleged Communists had infiltrated American government. McCarthy never substantiated his charges, but he forged an atmosphere of hatred and mistrust that ostracized iconoclasts. The second saw it as a metaphor for the perennial threat Communism posed to Americans. During the 1950s, the House Un-American Activities Committee launched a witch hunt and blacklisted many Hollywood filmmakers because of their involvement with the Communist Party between the 1930s and 1950s. As a casualty of the blacklist, Invasion of the Body Snatchers scenarist Daniel Mainwaring spent his remaining years writing under a pseudonym. A third school saw it as an indictment of the Levittown suburban mentality when everybody acted and dressed the same.Invasion of the Body Snatchers opens with a prologue as the police transport Dr. Hill (Whit Bissell of He Walks By Night) from the State Mental Hospital to see a delusional inmate who claims that he isn't insane. Dr. Hill sits down with our disheveled hero and listens to his story. Until the epilogue, when Siegel returns to the asylum, everything from here until then occurs in flashback as the story is told. Things begin innocently enough as a local physician, Dr. Miles Bennell (Kevin McCarthy of Annapolis Story), encounters patients in the small town of Santa Mira, California, who complain about their loved ones behaving like impostors. Town psychiatrist Dr. Dan Kaufman (Larry Gates) dismisses everything as hysteria. Soon, Bennell and his old friend Jack Belicec (King Donovan) and his wife Teddy (Carolyn Jones of The Addams Family) along with Bennell's former sweetheart Becky Driscoll (Dana Wynter), discover a replica of Jack in his house lying on his pool table. It's like the first impression stamped on a coin, Jack observes to Bennell. Bennell takes the body's fingerprints, but it has no fingerprints at this point. The thing awakens no long afterward, and Jack and Teddy flee to Bennell's house with news that the body looks exactly like Jack. Later, they learn seed pods are appearing everywhere. When people fall asleep, the pods hatch facsimiles. Bennell breaks into Becky's house, finds a pod in her cellar, but rescues her before she can turn into a pod person. Our hero theorizes that so many things have been discovered in the world since the advent of the atomic bomb that radiation may have affected plant or animal life or some weird alien organism. Bennell sends Jack and Teddy out of town to alert the authorities. Eventually, the impostors take over and corner Bennell and Becky. They explain that the seed pods entered the Earth, landed at a farm and took root. Life has driven too many people over the edge and the pods will free mankind of its worries. Nobody will ever be troubled by anything again. There is no need for love or emotion. Love, desire, ambition, faith&#x97;without them&#x97;life is so simple. Originally, Invasion of the Body Snatchers concluded with the frantic Bennell screaming his warning about these space aliens who robbed humans of their emotions and turned them into thoughtless automatons. Allied Artists sought to soften the hysteria. Siegel agreed against his wishes to add a prologue and an epilogue on the advice of Wanger for fear that the studio would re-edit the film.The legacy of Invasion of the Body Snatchers is considerable.

Film critics and scholars alike have read considerably more into its standard narrative about aliens taking over the earth than Siegel intended. Kevin McCarthy said years later he saw no political significance in the plot. One of Don Siegel's contemporaries and a renowned film producer in his own right, Walter Mirish wrote about the film's significance in his autobiography. People began to read meanings into pictures that were never intended. The Invasion of the Body Snatchers is an example of that. I remember reading a magazine article arguing that the picture was intended as an allegory about the communist infiltration of America. From personal knowledge, neither Walter Wanger nor Don Siegel, who directed it, nor Dan Mainwaring, who wrote the script nor the original author Jack Finney, nor myself saw it as anything other than a thriller, pure and simple. Nevertheless, good works of art are always prone to interpretations beyond those of its creators, and Invasion of the Body Snatchers became a lightning rod for commentary. Three schools of thought emerged about Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The first construed it as a polemic against the hysteria-inducing tactics of discredited Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy who alleged Communists had infiltrated American government. McCarthy never substantiated his charges, but he forged an atmosphere of hatred and mistrust that ostracized iconoclasts. The second saw it as a metaphor for the perennial threat Communism posed to Americans. During the 1950s, the House Un-American Activities Committee launched a witch hunt and blacklisted many Hollywood filmmakers because of their involvement with the Communist Party between the 1930s and 1950s. As a casualty of the blacklist, Invasion of the Body Snatchers scenarist Daniel Mainwaring spent his remaining years writing under a pseudonym. A third school saw it as an indictment of the Levittown suburban mentality when everybody acted and dressed the same.Invasion of the Body Snatchers opens with a prologue as the police transport Dr. Hill (Whit Bissell of He Walks By Night) from the State Mental Hospital to see a delusional inmate who claims that he isn't insane. Dr. Hill sits down with our disheveled hero and listens to his story. Until the epilogue, when Siegel returns to the asylum, everything from here until then occurs in flashback as the story is told. Things begin innocently enough as a local physician, Dr. Miles Bennell (Kevin McCarthy of Annapolis Story), encounters patients in the small town of Santa Mira, California, who complain about their loved ones behaving like impostors. Town psychiatrist Dr. Dan Kaufman (Larry Gates) dismisses everything as hysteria. Soon, Bennell and his old friend Jack Belicec (King Donovan) and his wife Teddy (Carolyn Jones of The Addams Family) along with Bennell's former sweetheart Becky Driscoll (Dana Wynter), discover a replica of Jack in his house lying on his pool table. It's like the first impression stamped on a coin, Jack observes to Bennell. Bennell takes the body's fingerprints, but it has no fingerprints at this point. The thing awakens no long afterward, and Jack and Teddy flee to Bennell's house with news that the body looks exactly like Jack. Later, they learn seed pods are appearing everywhere. When people fall asleep, the pods hatch facsimiles. Bennell breaks into Becky's house, finds a pod in her cellar, but rescues her before she can turn into a pod person. Our hero theorizes that so many things have been discovered in the world since the advent of the atomic bomb that radiation may have affected plant or animal life or some weird alien organism. Bennell sends Jack and Teddy out of town to alert the authorities. Eventually, the impostors take over and corner Bennell and Becky. They explain that the seed pods entered the Earth, landed at a farm and took root. Life has driven too many people over the edge and the pods will free mankind of its worries. Nobody will ever be troubled by anything again. There is no need for love or emotion. Love, desire, ambition, faith&#x97;without them&#x97;life is so simple. Originally, Invasion of the Body Snatchers concluded with the frantic Bennell screaming his warning about these space aliens who robbed humans of their emotions and turned them into thoughtless automatons. Allied Artists sought to soften the hysteria. Siegel agreed against his wishes to add a prologue and an epilogue on the advice of Wanger for fear that the studio would re-edit the film.The legacy of Invasion of the Body Snatchers is considerable. Philip Kaufman helmed an urban version of the Siegel film in 1978 with Donald Sutherland, but situated it in the urban sprawl of San Francisco. McCarthy reprised his role, and Siegel had a cameo. Later, independent director Abel Ferrara took it back to its rural roots in 1994 with Body Snatchers and located the action on a military base in Alabama. In 2007, another remake simply called Invasion appeared with Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. Originally, Jack Finney wrote the novel that Collier's Magazine serialized in 1954.

I don't watch silent movies. There are two exceptions to this rule. I watch Charlie Chaplin movies and I watch The General. I have yet to see another movie starring Buster Keaton, and I've decided, if he'd never made a movie besides The General, he'd still be a legend. Neither Buster Keaton nor Chaplin needed words to tell a heck of a story. In fact, even if The General did't have title cards to tell you what was going on, you'd still be able to figure it out.The plot is simple Johnny Gray (played by Keaton) is an locomotive engineer in the South when the War of Northern Aggression, er, Civil War breaks out. His best gal, Annabelle Lee, snubs him when she mistakenly assumes he's a coward because he doesn't enlist (when in reality he's not allowed to enlist because he's more valuable as an engineer). What takes place over the next hour or so is a series of scenes in which Keaton bumbles his way into rescuing Annabelle from captors, foils a pack of Northern spies, and almost singlehandedly routes the Northern army. Most of the action takes place aboard the film's namesake, The General, Gray's locomotive.The complaint against silent films is that there just isn't enough there without words to keep a viewer interested. Normally I agree, but Keaton's comic timing combined with numerous chase scenes keeps the pace lively. Kids under 10 are usually the toughest critics. I've heard and read many folks say that when they sat down with their young children to watch this one when the movie ended, the kids were ready for a repeat viewing.One of my favorite gags of the movie comes when Gray tries to shoot a cannonball from a moving train in order to hit a train full of spies he's pursuing. With one misstep, he manages to aim the cannon directly at himself. It's hard to choose a favorite scene because one gag begets another throughout the running time of the movie, and at a time of 74 minutes, it's amazing how many funny bits Keaton packs in.

Just why is Tim Roth not directing more films?Watching this film a decade after it's release I was quite amazed to see director Tim Roth not having directed anything else. We all know the man can act, but what exactly is he like behind the camera? So far The War Zone is the one and only way to find out, just unfortunately it's not the type of film most people would want to watch. Roth decided to make a feature based on the novel of the same name, and he made it with stunning results. Dealing with a shocking and heinous story and shot in the dull and dreary English countryside, The War Zone proves to be a tough film to watch. So much so that apparently actor Ray Winstone walked off the set because he was so upset at acting out one of the scenes. Talking about Ray Winstone, it is his superb acting that makes up for such daunting content.

Matched with stunning photography and a simple yet haunting score, Roth is able make the film seem desolate but at the same time compelling. It's really crazy to know that Roth hasn't dabbled more as a director because it seems he'd have a great future as one.

Just why is Tim Roth not directing more films?Watching this film a decade after it's release I was quite amazed to see director Tim Roth not having directed anything else. We all know the man can act, but what exactly is he like behind the camera? So far The War Zone is the one and only way to find out, just unfortunately it's not the type of film most people would want to watch. Roth decided to make a feature based on the novel of the same name, and he made it with stunning results. Dealing with a shocking and heinous story and shot in the dull and dreary English countryside, The War Zone proves to be a tough film to watch. So much so that apparently actor Ray Winstone walked off the set because he was so upset at acting out one of the scenes.

Critics who knew nothing of video games could spot the gaming errors made. No damage taken with damage clearly visible towards the beginning being a primary example.And I may have missed something, but wasn't Super Mario Bros. 3 suppose to be a game that had never played before? Well if that IS the case, and I did not miss anything... how did Fred Savage's character, and even the girl, know so much about the game already? We're talking things that some people don't know about by their second or third play-through.Beyond the factual and gaming errors there is the general low quality of the film itself. Nothing here is honestly very memorable. The kid wasn't even that good at playing video games in the footage they showed. A lot of kids I knew way back in those days were significantly more experienced. On top of all this the acting and storyline are just mediocre at their strongest points. The characters are bland and completely uninteresting, the 'Wizard' (the youngest child) is a very silent, completely dry child cliché of a little kid who almost never talks because of a trauma. It isn't that this is unrealistic, it's the fact that it had to be thrown into the movie to actually even begin to form a plot that would exceed even 30 minutes.Honestly, the only value that is to be found here is that of a nostalgic nature. If you grew up with this movie you're going to like it whether it was good or not. It was about kids playing video games, and at the time you saw it you likely had an obsession with the NES as well. But unless you loved it as a kid there just isn't anything that's going to keep you interested, and very little that will prevent you from turning it off.No sir, I didn't like it.

That's what I consider the Phantasm cast and crew to be, old friends. None of the Phantasm sequels have been able to live up to the legendary mystique of the original. What else is new though? Very few sequels ever are able to match originals? Nonetheless, Phantasm sequels are overall better than the majority of horror sequels. And in part four, Mike and Reggie continue their struggle to unravel the mysteries of the Tall Man, and save Mike from becoming a flying sphere. But back to old friends... I guess you could say that I'm one of those people that, Gets Phantasm. I understand why some people might not find any redeeming values in this film series; but to me this film and the characters it portrays are dear friends. Perhaps it's my own life experiences that enable me to level with the Phantasm plight. The Phantasm experience lies within each of us to most appropriately interpret. I, like many other Phantasm friends, have found solstice and understanding in Coscarelli's phantasmal imagining. I've been able to find solutions to my own real life problems and relive past memories through the help of all of the Phantasms. Part four is definitely a highly nostalgic imagining that die hard fans will certainly appreciate and understand. Others may have problems with part 4 and I understand, but don't know how to convert these people.This film was produced for slightly less than $1,000,000 in 1997! And while I'll be the first to admit that this fourth installment has it's fair share of problems, I commend the production team for a job well done. Part four is just smart film making, plain and simply, done on a minute budget. Coscarelli is a talented film maker; he's really quite a master of visual imagery and camera manipulation. Just think of the staggering number of movies in any genre that are made every year for ten or twenty million, yet still are total garbage. Most of what comes out of Hollywood is overpriced garbage anyway In 1998 and in 2009. Part four is far from being garbage at any production cost level. Everyone that worked on this movie worked on it because they cared about the people involved and expected something more than money out of it. The actors and production crew were there to make a movie for the fans that have supported the Phantasm legacy.
