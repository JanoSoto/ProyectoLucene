[{"date":"6 June 2006","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" K-PAX for me means Kindling ones Perception in conjunction with the unknown (X factor). It shows how one doesn't really take time to appreciate what is in front of you and you hope for something in your terms to happen. One always keeps looking for the unknown, and for some reason the unknown is not really an unknown. It's in you and you just need to search and find it. Live for today and do things today to make a better and content tomorrow. The movie is sending three messages for us;1> Find Happiness , look for it hard until it stares right back at you.2> Do something for others and yourself that will make a difference in yours and their lives.3> You are here now. Situations may be bad, but that doesn't stop life. Life goes on. Help life to grow with you.The movie is an absolute masterpiece. Its like a fine painting or a classical Symphony. The movie grows on you and you cant help but think  what is it that I have to do with life in our world!! A must see for movie lovers.Oh boy, Kevin Spacey, I wish the world would really see this actor and give him the appreciation and adulation he truly deserves. This is another one up his sleeve of commendable line up of movies that help shape his future legendary career.Kudos to everyone associated with this film and Thank you for this heart felt effort.
