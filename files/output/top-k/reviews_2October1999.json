Younger people may not understand it and parents may not let them see all those sex jokes), teenagers that like this kind of stuff, like myself.-A lot of stupid jokes that aren't funny for probably anyone in Earth.-A lot of unoriginal jokes.That's why I give it a 7.

I do have a large humanities background.WARNING I sketch out the plot a little in this review.OverviewI get the feeling that this movie may be a sequel to a movie I haven't seen yet. But I get that feeling with all of Clint Eastwood's western movies. He always seems to be the hero of the Dog eat dog and Kill or be killed western movies.The storyline is simple and sweet an old gunslinger is trying to raise his kids now that his wife has passed on. He is having a hard time of it and is offered a job as an assassin to kill two men who hacked up a prostitute in a small almost lawless town. There are several good subplots. Ones between the Eastwood's character and his old partner and him and his new partner. Basically there is a good character interaction between all of the characters but I don't think the character individually are filled out enough not even the main character. I wanted a little more depth so I would be more involved.I really am not sure why this movie won the Best Picture Award for the 1992 Academy Awards. I can understand things like Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan, Titanic and so on but not Unforgiven.I think this movie is a good movie to watch with someone or a group. You will have a lot of comments that you will want to share with others, nothing too strong, but I think I would have liked it better with someone. You will have something to say about each character and about fate, and luck.Be sure to check out my other reviews.Thanks.

The choice of locations and backdrops were very appropriately atmospheric, as the film was shot in pubs, bars and coffee bars. The film was original and worked on a deeper level throughout, it was able to drop all the usual clichéd characters and scenarios that populate so many of the mass bulk of formulaic films that account for the vast majority of Hollywood's output. This never strayed far from scenarios real ,and a storyline that could be related to, I first believed and then upon realisation wanted to believe that it was a true story, because the degree of observational accuracy on real-life and the familiar feel of real-life that is believable and credible ,the film had been quite remarkable. It is ironic that many people are not convinced that Matt Damon's character could be a genius and yet could have come from such circumstances of abuse and now be living such a 9-5 philistine lifestyle of laying bricks and nights on the town, as the film manages to persuade us that it is more than just the usual triumph over adversity case. It is a film about abuse ,and in it we are shown that the loss in normal family values and the resulting towing of society's line that that would probably normally cause ,brings up strongly other aspects of a person's character, and this might explain the heightened creativity or ability as depicted by Will Hunting. The story is very psychologically real and is refreshingly not so simplistic as most other popular films. It is so re-assuring to know that the films of this type can be made and can be profitable and that it doesn't always have to be the lowest common denominator that we so feared having a monopoly on the majority of films. He is a maths genius but he doesn't know it, he naively just gets on with it, just like Mozart with the box of wood known as a piano. But when he is discovered by a maths professor ,he must be brought out of himself, and his cocky, confident front that hides a deeply insecure individual whose fundamentals have been rocked by abuse. After being exposed to and brushing off a number of conservative and conformist psychologists he is brought under the wing of a very philosophical psychologist who he has some common ground with. Some of their procrastinations and profundities are alone worth the two hours.

Likely it will not be overly popular or in the theaters long, as it is short on raucous humor, sex and violence.  I like where the movie starts  in the middle.  The script (by Lawrence Kasdan) gives us carefully-written dialogue that is sparse, knowing that an intelligent audience will fill or wait for the pieces.  Its subtle humor will be appreciated by those who enjoy watching people transform in much the same ways we do in real time.  This is a rare portrayal of the power of listening, a skill that I find is greatly lacking in our society and therefore is rarely shown on screen as a virtue. Loren Dean's Doc Mumford is compassionate, quiet, non-judgmental, humorous, low-key.  The audience sees his emotions that are, for the most part, hidden from his patients.  The supporting cast is composed of a large number of familiar faces -- strong and interesting character actors -- each one showing unique and non-stereotypical personalities.  I had to maneuver through my own reactions to the implausibility of the basic premise of the film.  I resolved this by reminding myself of one of the joys of the film medium  at its best, it mimics real time life yet can take liberties with logic and sequence and time.

Knowing Greer Garson, who I considered the anti-Crawford, starred in it gave me more of an excuse.I finally watched it as film homework and loved it.  It's about an upper-middle-class English family (although most of the American actors are terrible holding their accents) and their experience in the early years of World War II.A swiftly-moving storyline takes us from the complacency of peace through air raids, Dunkirk and tragedy.  No one is a super-hero, but decent people who understand they must put aside their personal concerns and do what must be done to fight for their country and freedom.  No one preaches except the minister and he, only rarely.Of course, it being England, there's time for a flower show, and being a movie, there's a romance (WWII was not kind to Theresa Wright's characters, however).The film's remarkable pacing is one of its great highlights.  Long transitions are covered in the merest of hints; a comment that a servant has departed, for example.  Yet there's time for powerful, lengthy scenes such as that of the Minivers holed up in a crude bomb shelter with their two young children, away from their storybook home.  Despite the increasingly hellish crash of bombs and bullets, they try to chat about knitting and such.  But soon the fear builds to an unbearable climax and the family desperately clings to one another.The acting is generally superb, and much of the story is told through silent shots of the stars, rather than dialog.  Few moments are as touching as the shot of the glowing young wife seeing her husband off to war, admiring his courage, contrasted by the barely hidden fear and maturity of the mother.You can nit-pick; the movie has many of the conventional stylistic hallmarks of the period.

Few moments are as touching as the shot of the glowing young wife seeing her husband off to war, admiring his courage, contrasted by the barely hidden fear and maturity of the mother.You can nit-pick; the movie has many of the conventional stylistic hallmarks of the period.  But it is the masterpiece it has long been hailed.

This is OK, but it can also be dangerous, because it is human nature to confuse our own opinions with fundamental human conditions. Not that we would ever do that, of course, but the movie makers here seem to have a blend of genuine reality as well as the fashionable story lines of the ideogogue (that's a fancy term for a manure filled person who doesn't recognize the manure-ness of their, and all, opinions).Much of the drama has to do with the horrible situation of a real individual human being getting caught up and included in a big, impersonal event. Here the reduction of a human life (including the families and friends not in the military) to a mere cog, a mere member of a group, a side in a conflict, is powerful and moving. Yet these stories were also told as they bridged two real cultures-- Saddam's Iraq on one side and the West on the other. Thus, the writers\/director had to select some real features of the times and the politics to portray as backdrop for the movie's story. Precisely here is where they stumbled a bit-- all military authority and hierarchy was depicted as fumbling and inefficient-- with a hint of some hidden agenda, some unnamed evil. The explanation that they war was about oil rights was also trotted out as the prime cause of the actual Iraqi war. While I agree that the fabled liberating of Kuwait was also bogus as an explanation-- I would guess that most folks saw through that story by the time the real war was over-- the blood for oil explanation dished up by the knee-jerk marxists at the time, and since, was equally insulting.There is undoubtedly a grain of truth in these explanations, but they are too shaky and too distracting from other important issues to be worthy of a film maker's or audience's time. Some analysts, including some at the Kremlin, reported later that the primary reason most of the Russian generals refused to support the military coup that happened right after the Iraqi war, was because they had been profoundly demoralized by the swift defeat of their client military regime-- Saddam's army and air force. It has been said that the Iraqi war was the proxy for the long dreaded stand-off between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. Maybe it prevented World Ware III? It was shown that all the Russian military stuff was crap; and the best and bright Soviet advice failed to produce a useful strategy for the Iraqis.Whatever-- Three Kings is a great movie because of the harsh edge with which they depict battle. It is also a lame and mediocre movie (in parts), because of the superficial and media friendly arguments it sometimes used to criticize the war. It sounded, at times, like a group of 19 year old college students mouthing back the conventional, modern, politically correct versions of why government (read mom and dad?) is wrong. Come on-- do your own thinking, folks. Learn to see beyond the cliches and slogans (the ideology) that you have been spoon fed. If you want to criticize something-- great! But do it intelligently, with at least some grasp of objectivity, and for the right reasons.Overall-- heavy themes, good job. George Clooney is SO great as an actor-- he really gets to shine here.

I found The Matrix to be simultaneously mind-altering, exhilarating, gasp-inducing, nauseating and maddening. Yet I believe that the true power of the film lies in its ability to make the viewer truly believe in the power of the Matrix. As I watched the film, I lost myself in the world of the 21st century. Yet the most chilling part of the film was the concept that machines could overrun the world. The concept of artificial intelligence with emotions and needs was addressed well in 2001 A Space Odyssey, but this film goes far beyond HAL. The idea of artificial intelligence considering us to be zoo animals, and accusing us of exhausting supplies-since when is artificial intelligence a natural commodity? Since when do computers deserve the earth more than humans? And since when did people lose all worth? I truly wanted to attack Agent Smith as he hurled these depraved comments at Morpheus.On a lighter note, I loved all of the little allusions in the film. Obviously, Follow the White Rabbit came from Alice in Wonderland, and Morpheus' comment about tumbling down the hole followed in the same vein. There was also a great deal of Biblical imagery. Neo was like a present day Jesus. There were also numerous references to religion, including Trinity's name, Adam Road, and the idea that he was THE ONE to save humanity. You could also consider Cypher a type of Judas, who would betray his friends for riches. Yet I also saw a bit of the X-Files in this film, with the theme of conspiracy; Star Wars, with Morpheus as a sort of Jedi master (Don't think about it, do it.) and Neo as a sort of Luke Skywalker. Even Morpheus' comment had a Yoda-like feel about it. I think that the film took great pains to demonstrate the values of humanity, and the price they put on life. The artificial intelligence was a sharp contrast. Although Smith confides that he too wants to be free, he hates humanity. Neo and friends aim to preserve life.

Coming off one of the worst periods in cinema for teens, I was praying that vet Melissa Joan Hart could save me from utter garbage like SHE'S ALL THAT, TEACHING MRS. TINGLE, and TEN THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU. All of those films relied on the Gap-universe ethic and outlandish stereotypes to portray their respective teen microcosms. They all hide behind the I loved John Hughes excuse, but Mr. Hughes's films were never like the current crop of air-headed junk that young audiences are eating up. Good films like ELECTION, which used real high school students for extras, are passed on by, not as dumb or remotely hip to be noticed. All this makes DRIVE ME CRAZY even more of a disappointment than it already is.SABRINA, THE TEENAGE WITCH's Melissa Joan Hart stars as Nicole, a overachieving teenager with a flighty mom (V's Faye Grant), an absent father (7TH HEAVEN's Stephen Collins), and a loser neighbor named Chase who happens to be the same age(Adrian Grenier, the recent ADVENTURES OF SEBASTIAN COLE). Attending the same school, both Nicole and Chase couldn't be further apart in terms of popularity. She, arranging the school's centennial celebration dance, he, spending his time putting orange ink in the sprinkler system. The two are exact opposites. When Nicole's object of affection, a basketball jock with a haircut that needs to seen to be believed, won't ask her to the dance, she enlists the help of her former childhood friend Chase to help her make the narrow-minded jock jealous of what he could have had. Chase, hurting from a recent breakup with his girlfriend, sees the opportunity to make his ex jealous as well. Wackiness and hidden feelings ensue.While DRIVE ME CRAZY is decently made film, I was shocked to find the movie devoid of any kinetic energy at all. Director John Schultz only seems to understand soundtrack plugs and ugly closeups. This is the only high school comedy this year with the pungent aroma of odd seeping through. Scenes begin and end without much structure, actors are left to hang with often very poor dialog, and the aforementioned soundtrack is terribly by-the-numbers. The only time the audience seemed to truly enjoy the film was when Britney Spears's current Crazy song was cued up. Sad for a film that seems to want to please so much.The plot alone is something more menacing than autopilot. I'm not sure what the next level beyond clichéd may be, but DRIVE ME CRAZY is it. I find it hard to believe that the studios are not noticing that the teenage films are all alike. Almost each one has climaxed at a dance of somesort. I'm sure most people could tell me the entire sequence of events in DRIVE just from observing the poster. Predictability is one thing, DRIVE is completely without any invention.Melissa Joan Hart is a very likable performer. Her past triumphs in television have made her a very natural and charming actress. While DRIVE doesn't require anything in the form of effort from Hart, she still manages to ingratiate herself with the role. Adrian Grenier was wonderful in the little seen (and probably rightly so) ADVENTURES OF SEBASTIAN COLE. He's got a unique low-key charm, and is probably one of the few actors his age with a handsomeness that isn't forced or common. I liked him in DRIVE only for the fact that Grenier makes his character seem more two-dimensional than on the page. His loser character seems to enjoy his popularity for a short time. A nice change from the usual It's all right to be different riffraff that passes for morals in these types of films.DRIVE is lifeless. A film that just doesn't bother to meet the audience halfway. I wanted it to be so much more than a routine teenage melodrama.  I 've had enough of that, and I think the audience has too. In a theater full of 14 year-old girls, nobody laughed, nobody cheered, nobody swooned. For a movie genre that prides itself on these ethics, DRIVE could be considered a disaster.

Coming off one of the worst periods in cinema for teens, I was praying that vet Melissa Joan Hart could save me from utter garbage like SHE'S ALL THAT, TEACHING MRS. TINGLE, and TEN THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU. All of those films relied on the Gap-universe ethic and outlandish stereotypes to portray their respective teen microcosms. They all hide behind the I loved John Hughes excuse, but Mr. Hughes's films were never like the current crop of air-headed junk that young audiences are eating up. Good films like ELECTION, which used real high school students for extras, are passed on by, not as dumb or remotely hip to be noticed. All this makes DRIVE ME CRAZY even more of a disappointment than it already is.SABRINA, THE TEENAGE WITCH's Melissa Joan Hart stars as Nicole, a overachieving teenager with a flighty mom (V's Faye Grant), an absent father (7TH HEAVEN's Stephen Collins), and a loser neighbor named Chase who happens to be the same age(Adrian Grenier, the recent ADVENTURES OF SEBASTIAN COLE). Attending the same school, both Nicole and Chase couldn't be further apart in terms of popularity. She, arranging the school's centennial celebration dance, he, spending his time putting orange ink in the sprinkler system. The two are exact opposites. When Nicole's object of affection, a basketball jock with a haircut that needs to seen to be believed, won't ask her to the dance, she enlists the help of her former childhood friend Chase to help her make the narrow-minded jock jealous of what he could have had. Chase, hurting from a recent breakup with his girlfriend, sees the opportunity to make his ex jealous as well. Wackiness and hidden feelings ensue.While DRIVE ME CRAZY is decently made film, I was shocked to find the movie devoid of any kinetic energy at all. Director John Schultz only seems to understand soundtrack plugs and ugly closeups. This is the only high school comedy this year with the pungent aroma of odd seeping through. Scenes begin and end without much structure, actors are left to hang with often very poor dialog, and the aforementioned soundtrack is terribly by-the-numbers. The only time the audience seemed to truly enjoy the film was when Britney Spears's current Crazy song was cued up. Sad for a film that seems to want to please so much.The plot alone is something more menacing than autopilot. I'm not sure what the next level beyond clichéd may be, but DRIVE ME CRAZY is it. I find it hard to believe that the studios are not noticing that the teenage films are all alike. Almost each one has climaxed at a dance of somesort. I'm sure most people could tell me the entire sequence of events in DRIVE just from observing the poster. Predictability is one thing, DRIVE is completely without any invention.Melissa Joan Hart is a very likable performer. Her past triumphs in television have made her a very natural and charming actress. While DRIVE doesn't require anything in the form of effort from Hart, she still manages to ingratiate herself with the role. Adrian Grenier was wonderful in the little seen (and probably rightly so) ADVENTURES OF SEBASTIAN COLE. He's got a unique low-key charm, and is probably one of the few actors his age with a handsomeness that isn't forced or common. I liked him in DRIVE only for the fact that Grenier makes his character seem more two-dimensional than on the page. His loser character seems to enjoy his popularity for a short time.
