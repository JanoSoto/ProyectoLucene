[{"date":"3 April 2007","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Kathleen (Meg Ryan) runs a small bookstore in New York City. Her mother owned and operated the store for years and, upon her death, passed it along to her daughter. Kathleen has an ongoing relationship with a newspaper columnist (Greg Kinnear) but something is wanting. That's why her favorite activity is corresponding, via email, with a gentleman she met in a chat room. She has not met this man in real life, but, hangs on his every word and the feeling seems to be returned. Meanwhile, Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) is about to open a mega bookstore just around the corner from Kathleen's small but lovely store. Joe and Kathleen meet at a party and seem to dislike each other but, more importantly, the two will be competitors very soon. Will Kathleen's store be able to survive the book wars that are coming? And, will Kathleen ever meet the cyberspace gentleman of her dreams? This is a lovely story on film, told with humor and heartwarming care. Ryan and Hanks, as they did in Joe and the Volcano and in Sleepless in Seattle, prove that they are a quietly dynamic duo in the realm of romantic comedies. The supporting cast of Kinnear, Parker Posey, Steve Zahn, Dave Chappelle, and Jean Stapleton, is also a film lover's fondest wish. Nora and Delia Ephron's script is intelligent, witty and clever and Nora's direction is quite wonderful as well. The costumes, scenery, and overall production values are fine indeed. If you have never treated yourself to this movie, don't delay, not even for another week. You've got good times ahead of you, at any showing, especially if you can curl up next to that special someone on the sofa.

I picked up the DVD for $6.99. It was well worth it. The cinematography captures the heat and humidity of a Florida heat wave. (Not all of it from the bodies of the two main characters - Matty and Ned.) The dialogue cleverly works the metaphor of the heat into the steamy affair that Matty (Kathleen Turner) is having with the small-town lawyer (William Hurt). This is one of the earliest films for both Turner and Hurt.Not surprisingly, the plot involves a murder and the contrived entanglements along the way. Not in the same league as Chinatown as a latter-day film noir, it nevertheless holds the viewer's attention through the expected and not-so expected twists and turns. Ted Danson gives a great supporting performance as Ned's drinking buddy. It is hard to shake the image of Sam Malone behind the bar in Cheers but he comes close in this role. Mickey Rourke, one of the brat pack actors from the 80's, also pops up in the film. The film is largely forgotten more than 25 years on (were the eighties that long ago?)but it is still well worthwhile. As with the film noir genre, happy endings are not the norm, only survivors and victims.
