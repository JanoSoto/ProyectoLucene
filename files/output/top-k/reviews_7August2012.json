[{"date":"7 August 2012","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" His last British film before making the jump to Hollywood, the great Alfred Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes captures much of what made the filmmaker so iconic, yet it doesn't hold up as well against his best films of the '40s and '50s.Suspense in The Lady Vanishes should be a term used loosely. The story's main conceit is classic Hitchcock paranoia, but in its most simplistic form. Margaret Lockwood stars as Iris, a young woman who boards a train home from the fictional European country of Bandrika. She's tended to by a woman in her car named Miss Froy (Dame May Witty), but after a long nap wakes to find that she has disappeared and everyone on the train denies having ever seen her.It takes a good 30 minutes, however, before this all plays out, as the story begins in a Bandrika hotel so as to introduce its many characters in superfluous fashion. This beginning turns out to be somewhat comical, which isn't Hitchcock's strong suit. Trains, however, are his wheelhouse, and The Lady Vanishes gets substantially better at that point, even if it never takes on a darker, more menacing tone.Lockwood and costar Michael Redgrave help sell the whole mystery. Redgrave plays Gilbert, the cheeky musician Iris had a most disagreeable meeting with the night before in the hotel. Gilbert takes to believing that Iris isn't seeing things, though largely because he fancies her. Together they endeavor to figure out what's happened to Miss Froy and in doing so contend with all kinds of unusual circumstances.Yet the mystery won't have many people second guessing themselves. After all, when Iris first questions the many folks on the train, both the adulterous Mrs. Todhunter (Linden Travers) and friends Caldicott (Naunton Wayne) and Charters (Basil Radford) lie about having seen her, the former to hide her affair and the latter to make sure they make it on time for a cricket match. There's a little social commentary there, but the script never pushes it.So unlike other Hitchcock protagonists, we don't empathize with the main character's paranoia so much as simply observe it. Nevertheless, other than a few obvious clues that point us in the right direction, we're playing Sherlock and Watson right along with Iris and Gilbert.The reveal is also a little less-than-satisfying, as it happens in such a matter-of-fact way and with plenty of time left in the film. Rather than keep us guessing to the end, the story puts all but one card down with 20-30 minutes left and then leans on putting the main characters in peril as its primary entertainment device. It all culminates in a less-than-stellar shootout and the film's final reveal, which is somewhat anti-climactic.It feels as though Hitchcock could have done more to put his stamp on the film. He has a couple sudden shots of disembodied hands coming from out of nowhere to up the action as well as one truly trademark sequence in which Iris imagines everyone in her train car as Miss Froy. They're all such creepy-looking folks to boot, so that amplifies the effect. Still, taking place on a train ends up the prime indicator that it's a Hitchcock film.There should be little question, however, that the little Hitchcock does do elevates The Lady Vanishes to classic status. Given the complexity of his later thrillers and other contemporary entries, it loses a bit of luster, but The Lady Vanishes still represents textbook filmmaking technique for the genre.~Steven CThanks for reading!

To its great credit, Breakdown doesn't fall into this trap as its set-up provides the introduction to an extremely entertaining action thriller that's full of twists, mystery and suspense. This is an unpretentious film that because of the strength of its plot, some good acting performances and a few well orchestrated action sequences, easily keeps its audience fully engrossed from start to finish.Jeff Taylor (Kurt Russell) and his wife Amy (Kathleen Quinlan) are a middle class couple from Boston who are on a cross country journey to a new life in San Diego when they have the misfortune to break down on a desert road far from anywhere. Fortuitously, help soon arrives in the form of an affable looking truck driver called Red Barr (J T Walsh) who offers them a lift to a diner some miles down the road. Amy readily accepts this offer so that she can phone for help but Jeff decides to stay with their vehicle which is a very new looking red Jeep Cherokee.After a little time has elapsed, Jeff discovers that the cause of the breakdown was some disconnected wires that are hanging loose below the front of the car. He easily reconnects them and then travels on to the diner where he makes enquiries about his wife. The disinterested and rather unfriendly locals say they haven't seen Amy or Red.A little while later, Jeff catches up with Red's rig and gets him to stop but to his amazement, Red denies knowing him or Amy. Jeff then waves down a passing sheriff called Boyd (Rex Linn) and explains what's happened but after making a few checks and talking to the very plausible Red, Boyd is unable to help any further and suggests that Jeff should visit his deputy to report his wife missing. Jeff follows Boyd's advice but this turns out to be just the start of his long and very dangerous search for his missing wife.As the audience sees the unfolding events through Jeff's eyes, it makes his frustration, anger and fear very real and it also becomes impossible not to empathise with the terrifying predicament that he's in. There's also an ominous sense of paranoia that develops as the universal lack of concern or help that he receives starts to make his experience appear to be part of a conspiracy and leads one to question how close the links are between Red, Boyd and the unsympathetic people at the diner. When the story moves beyond this point, the reality of what's happening soon becomes horrifyingly clear.Kurt Russell very convincingly conveys the mixture of emotions that Jeff goes through during what can only be described as a nightmare scenario and also remains credible as he tackles the various challenges that he encounters.

From a fine old family, she nevertheless has very little money. The big bucks, instead, belong to Lily's aunt and Lily makes her home with this lady. It is assumed that when the aunt passes away, Lily will inherit. Meanwhile, Lily hobnobs with the cream of society, a mostly married circle of friends that includes Mrs. Bertha Dorset (Laura Linney) and her husband, single gentleman Lawrence Selden (Eric Stolz), and Gus Trenor (Dan Ackroyd) and his wife. Naturally, our Lil must keep herself looking smart, so her aunt complains about clothing bills, and Miss Bart secretly plays cards for money. This last would upset her aunt, if she knew, so Lily tries to cover her tracks, as she does get an allowance. But, all too soon, her debts are high and she must set her cap on making a rich marriage, even though she may be harboring an affection for Mr. Selden. Its all for naught, you see, because Selden is not rich, either, but a lawyer climbing the ranks. A good match would be Percy Gryce, as far as money is concerned, but he is a bit priggish. When Lily flirts with him at a party, she sleeps late the next day and misses church. Away goes Mr. Gryce, only to marry another wealthy lady. Another rich gentleman, Sim Rosedale (Anthony LaPaglia) likes Lily and being Jewish, needs an blueblood wife to advance in society. However, since her heart is not in it, she turns him down. Learning of her desperation, Lily's friend, Mr. Trenor, says he will invest some of her money to increase her spending power. Too late, Lily discovers that he expects romantic favors and she refuses him. Bertha becomes jealous of Lily, too, so the circle of friends cast Lily from the group. Hoping for her aunt's money, Lily is stunned to learn she is mostly cut of of the will. What will she do to survive? This is a classic tale by Edith Wharton, one of America's best writers ever. Wharton came from the high society of old money New York and she knew it through and through. Lily is a most tragic figure in that she is beautiful, witty, and charming but that is not enough without money. Alas, she also throws away her chances for stability at every turn. Anderson gives a sensitive and wistful performances as Lily while Linney, Ackroyd, Stolz, LaPaglia, and all of the others do great work, too. The costumes and sets are to die for while the direction has a careful, studied touch that aids the tale. No, don't watch this one if you are not having a mirthful week.

Unlike his previous effort, The Seventh Seal, made the same year as this, Bergman unfolds more of a Charles Dickens-esque story, more centered on the modern world rather than the Middle Ages, and a one about how a man can see his childhood memories with piercing clarity, yet can not fathom or even begin to be piece together his present life.The man is Professor Isak Borg, played by the marvelous director Victor Sjöström. Isak is the bossy and stubborn professor of bacteriology, who resides in a small home with just a house maid for company. He must make the lengthy trip from Stockholm to Lund to receive an honorary degree after graduating from Lund University fifty years ago. Ingrid Thulin is Marianne, his pregnant daughter-in-law who is planning to divorce her husband once the baby is born. She views her father-in-law much like the rest of the world; snotty, ungrateful, and unimportant.It is during this long car trip that Isak begins to see through to his inner-self. This newfound exercise is assisted by three different groups of people he encounters. One is the relationship with his close family, which is closed-off to his mother, daughter-in-law, and son. Another is with people he encounters while on the road, like a bickering married couple, who relationship is apparently physically and verbally abusive, along with a group of young hikers. And the final relationship is with the man's own psyche, which writer\/director Bergman does not hesitate to plunge deeply into.We see Isak's psyche through metaphoric and sometimes disturbing dream sequences, one of which takes place right at the beginning of the film. The dream involves Isak walking down an empty road, disillusioned and confused. The clocks do not have hands on them, and everything appears washed-out and unusually bright. We see a horse-drawn carriage collide into a pole, releasing one of its wooden wheels. The horse scurry off frightened when a casket falls off the carriage, opening slightly, revealing its contents to be those of Isak's. The body attempts to pull him in right before Isak can snap back into reality. That scene plays like a short film in itself and is surreal and poignant, offering more than words could ever.Wild Strawberries is a treat everyone should indulge in. It provided me with one of the most thought-provoking characters I've ever seen - someone who can connect and get on the good side of those he just meets, but truly takes advantage of and detaches himself from those close to him - and gave me one of the rawest and interesting dramas I have yet to see.Starring Victor Sjöström, Bibi Andersson, Ingrid Thulin, and Gunnar Björnstrand.

She views her father-in-law much like the rest of the world; snotty, ungrateful, and unimportant.It is during this long car trip that Isak begins to see through to his inner-self. This newfound exercise is assisted by three different groups of people he encounters. One is the relationship with his close family, which is closed-off to his mother, daughter-in-law, and son. Another is with people he encounters while on the road, like a bickering married couple, who relationship is apparently physically and verbally abusive, along with a group of young hikers. And the final relationship is with the man's own psyche, which writer\/director Bergman does not hesitate to plunge deeply into.We see Isak's psyche through metaphoric and sometimes disturbing dream sequences, one of which takes place right at the beginning of the film. The dream involves Isak walking down an empty road, disillusioned and confused. The clocks do not have hands on them, and everything appears washed-out and unusually bright. We see a horse-drawn carriage collide into a pole, releasing one of its wooden wheels. The horse scurry off frightened when a casket falls off the carriage, opening slightly, revealing its contents to be those of Isak's. The body attempts to pull him in right before Isak can snap back into reality. That scene plays like a short film in itself and is surreal and poignant, offering more than words could ever.Wild Strawberries is a treat everyone should indulge in. It provided me with one of the most thought-provoking characters I've ever seen - someone who can connect and get on the good side of those he just meets, but truly takes advantage of and detaches himself from those close to him - and gave me one of the rawest and interesting dramas I have yet to see.Starring Victor Sjöström, Bibi Andersson, Ingrid Thulin, and Gunnar Björnstrand. Directed by Ingmar Bergman.

It deals with the theory of the superhuman. Meaning what if people had the right to eliminate beings they believe to be inferior to them. How we could become a super species if these weaker strings no longer existed. Another theme the film deals with is the value of the human life. Who really has the power to judge, who lives and who doesn't. The film handles these themes with great care and real opens up discussion.Directing is really where the film shines. Alfred Hitchcock gives away exactly what happens and who does it, but creates tension with characters and the fear of being discovered. He created a very real environment with real characters. The film progresses naturally and the editing is the highlight of the directing. There are only so many edits and the ones that are there are incredibly hard to notice. A lot of the shots are done in one take and it is credit to the director and actors to be patient and not losing character or flow because one mess up could have caused them to start over again. One scene flows into the other so seamlessly and adds to the feeling of actually being in the apartment with the characters.Acting is fantastic and the characters are great with a lot of depth. The main characters are Rupert (Stewart), Philip (Granger), and Brandon (Dall). Rupert is the suspicious former teacher of Philip and Brandon. He suspects something is wrong and begins to snoop around. Stewart plays the character with class and a level of sophistication. Philip is the nervous wreck, who fears of being discovered for their crime. Granger is good as the character, he's nervous and his body language only adds to the character. The highlight of the film is Brandon, very smooth and intellectual, who believes he is a genius beyond compare. Dall is the character, he fast talking and sly. A lot of double play in what he says and knowing he is a murderer, he's very likable.

This was curious as I had no difficulty in remembering 'Kane' despite having only seen it once some 35 years ago. Since I could not recall missing any other James Stewart picture of that era or any of the other big productions of 1950s I assumed that I had seen it but would view it again. I watched it last night and my instincts were correct. I had forgotten this film because it is forgettable! In fact the only memorable thing about the film was the San Francisco skyline which had become beautifully enhanced by its conversion to BluRay. I have never been a great Hitchcock fan for the very reason that his films tend to be over-stylised and Vertigo is no exception. No great acting accolades either in fact dialogue seem to be a secondary consideration to the visual enactment of Stewart's character's mental decline. The film could easily have been a silent film. One critic commented on being fascinated by the complexity of this multi-layered psycho-drama. Uhmm, really. The ending was pure David Lynch - not difficult to see where he got his inspiration, but it was inadequate for a movie lasting beyond two hours. For lovers of this movie genre I would recommend 'The Woman in the Fifth'. Don't be put off by its low rating in IMDb. It is fine example Pawel Pawlilowski's direction and Ethan Hawke is excellent as the mentally-bewildered American adrift in Paris. Back to Vertigo and what more can I say? This film and others of its period have garnered praise well beyond their station by virtue of the current nostalgia boom. My criterion for deciding how good a film is is whether or not it stands the test of time - does it look dated? This film does, as does 'From Here to Eternity' but 'On the Waterfront' doesn't.It's purely personal of course.

With the voices of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Kelsey Grammar.

However, after meeting Jessie the Cowgirl and Stinky Pete the Prospector, Woody learns of something from his past that is now impacting greatly on his new found friends. Decisions will have to be made and someone is going to be hurt......After the roaring success of the ground breaking Toy Story (1995), news of a sequel was perhaps met with hardly any surprise. What may have surprised many was that it is every bit as good as the first film, even going a bit darker in the theme department, making it a precursor of Pixar movies to come later down the line.

However, Mr. Lonsdale - a notorious gangster in the local area - is well aware of this young man's renowned talent at playing cards and his uncanny ability of detecting and reading emotions in order to manipulate the game's proceedings. He is not willing to take the chance of losing, so he cheats, and bullies Eddy into borrowing £500,000 from him to see him in the biggest pot of the night. Eddy loses, and he is told that he has seven days to get the money back to Mr. Lonsdale or else he and his friends will lose their fingers and possibly more. In a desperate bid to get the money together, the boys overhear Eddy's neighbours - a gang of sadistic thieves led by Dog (Frank Harper) - planning a heist on some yuppy drug-dealers in their fortified flat apparently loaded with money and drugs. So Eddy and the boys scheme to rob the gang when they return from the heist in order to get the money, but what follows is a twisted, chaotic and disorganised tale of mayhem as a giant, brutal hit-man (Vinnie Jones) and a manic afro-sporting gangster named Rory Breaker get involved in the intertwining story.

One can detect early on that Ritchie is a director who knows damn well what he wants to do from the opening scene, and it's certainly a visual treat; the slow-motion action, the unconventional camera-techniques and the really dark humour shrouded under a veil of bullets and mayhem as the story plays out Quentin Tarantino Pulp Fiction style as the motley crew of small-time crooks, thieves and drug dealers intertwined with sadistic gangsters doing a complete circle before they all collide at the films climax. The editing is brilliant and ensures that everything moves along at a nice pace, and the narration by Alan Ford is very fitting and adds a certain edge to the film that many British Gangster films have lacked before it, and since.

I've since outgrown that, and this underrated gem is one of the reasons why. After ignoring it because of the fun-for-the-whole-family Disney marketing, we discovered it on video. Tall Tale is neither lightweight nor pure escapism. It was co-written by Robert Rodat who a few years later wrote Saving Private Ryan and The Patriot, and is every bit as serious. My wife attributes the lightweight dismissal\/compartmentalization to the fact that it's dangerous. Considering the covert-overt indictment of greed-saturated America it slips into the hands of children and generally corrupt, complicit parents, I'd have to agree. Such iconic American legends as Pecos Bill are its patriotic measuring point. The family-film presentation is true to the Code championed by those legends Protect the land, defend the defenseless, and don't never spit in front of women nor children. The script hands us the cognitive key Just 'cause it's a TALL tale don't mean it ain't TRUE. By 1995 America was simply too far gone to cherish this. Ignoring it as a consumer remains my worst big-screen mistake. Kudos to Mr. Rodat, the director, the cinematographer for gorgeous moments, Randy Edelman --- his score for the scene of the farm horse abandoned in harness by a farm-hating boy is fleetingly but heartbreakingly perfect --- and to the project's rebel (distracted? shallow?) Disney VP. The scene in which Pecos emerges, like heroic resolve itself, from the midst of a richly diverse public that has F I N A L L Y come together to nobly stand against the takeover by predatory eastern greed and its hired guns --- Rodat's script does not favor a disarmed populace --- deftly fulfills the principle of showing not saying it. This is a beautiful, ambitious, patriotic alarm contained in a suitable-for-children and therefore subversive valentine to a Western American dream that was worth fighting for. All that and veteran character actor Burgess Meredith bidding a suckered-and-proud-of-it boy (us) farewell. See this serious as a heart attack film --- we get a horrific prophetic vision, in a scene that is Hell on Wheels not Little Red Caboose, of a subjugated West whose workers are getting additional productivity squeezed out of them (to use a post-Bailout euphemism) with literal whips --- before or after the documentary Inside Job. Speaking of hired guns, Wall Street and the Business Roundtable, America's unelected, voter-unaccountable rulers with politicians in their pockets, have a vested interest in popular media as both profit sector and opinion influencer. They have agents in the field and the field now prominently includes cyberspace. Do not be deceived. That this deeply patriotic lament\/warning is fit for children older than perhaps 7 --- a 12-year-old boy is propositioned by a pathetically degraded woman then nearly killed by a knife-wielding Wall Street hatchet man and former farmer (played presumably as written with non-cartoonish touches of passionate hate, cold honesty, restrained pride with demanding eastern bosses, and even a flash of tenderness by Scott Glenn) --- does not make it lightweight. It makes it brilliant. And convicting. Embarrassing in a way. Pecos Bill, Calamity Jane, free man John Henry, and Paul Bunyan are what many used to want America, at least the American West, to be an America standing morally tall. Truly free, truly brave.

There's a great deal of spirit and ambition in this film, but it just lags a lot in scenes, and the longer you watch it, the more it starts to lose focus, and much of the humor that made it so enjoyable towards the beginning. I did enjoy its unstructured plot, but interest level starts to wane after about the 2 hour mark. This one definitely could have used some cutting; however, this film does take place underground, and the visuals, the music and the setting make for a great atmosphere and a plot that is always unpredictable and filled with adventure, and fun; however, if you want to watch a Kusturica film, I'd go with his other one I've seen Arizona Dream. It's equally bizarre but it has a much more engaging and interesting story.

Since seeing this horror classic as a kid, I've stayed out of the fog and full moons. I also keep an eye on my big dog for more than just fleas. Come to think of it, maybe I should also check my feet to see if they need a shave. Anyway, poor Larry Talbot, he's definitely the most sympathetic of the classic monsters. Chaney never again reached the pinnacle performance he manages here as the star-crossed Talbot. His anguish shows that having extraordinary powers is no fun, least of all, when dog food just won't do.And what a great supporting cast. Still, I wish the producers could have worked in a few clashes between two of the most forceful personalities of the day&#x97; Rains and the imposing Warren William. But, tell me, why do movie lovelies like Ankers insist on walking alone, in the foggy woods, with an angry werewolf looking for the type of companionship he can gnaw on. Oh well, I guess there are things we'll never know.But my real Oscar goes to whoever came up with those impressively atmospheric sets. Likely the grand interiors were leftovers from bigger productions. But whatever the source, they add spooky mood and class to the story. All in all, the movie shows how superior results can be achieved, even on smaller budget. Meanwhile, I'm taking my walk while its still sunny. And I'll definitely be back before dark.

Just don't go and what this movie expecting gunslingers or people riding on horses for half of the movie its duration. This is simply not that type of western. It's a western done Robert Altman style! I am still learning and starting to get and see Robert Altman's style. Still can't say I am a big fan of him but I can still certainly appreciate this movie. Seems that Robert Altman movies are ones that aren't necessarily focused on its storytelling but are more movies that just moves along. It's a movie that observes, instead of tells. It makes his movies slow and not all that exciting but still realistic feeling ones, also especially with its characters and dialog.It's still not entirely my cup of tea but I could still like and appreciate this movie for its style. I could especially appreciate for being different. Here is a movie that still has some of the familiar western tropes and characters in it but it takes a totally different approach on things, making it a pretty unique watch as well. It also has a pretty solid story in it, that besides provides the movie with plenty of rich characters. It also definitely has some good acting in it, especially by its two leads Warren Beatty and Julie Christie. It even earned Christie an Oscar nomination. The movie has a pretty raw and gritty feeling to it and not just due to its storytelling. Also its visuals really support this, making this an 'ugly' and 'dirty' movie to watch, in the best sense of the two words. It's a compliment really and means that the movie succeeds in creating a certain mood and atmosphere for this movie that suits its storytelling and characters well.Not really my thing but I could still appreciate the movie and all of the effort and talent that went into making it.7\/10 http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"7 August 2012","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" You could say this is a western only by its settings and time period it is supposed to be set in.

Redford plays Roy Hobbs who aspires to be a Major League player after discovering he has a great pitching talent at a young age. Roy's dreams are ended when a mysterious woman (Barbara Hershey) shoots him in a murder attempt and then she commits suicide. Years later, Roy takes up his dreams again and heads to the Minor League team, the New York Knights who are the worst team in their league. Eventually Roy is faced with a repeat of his past when another mysterious woman (Kim Basinger) enters the picture. I normally don't like sports movies, but 'The Natural' is a huge exception. Robert Redford is one of my favorite actors and he does not disappoint in this film. He has the charm and strength that Roy has, but he plays on Roy's weaknesses so well that he evokes the sympathy that he gets at the opening of the film. If you are into sports, The Natural' is just the one for you.

The humor hits harder if you're also married. The two are constantly at odds as Felix nags Oscar, even though he claims he's trying not to. Oscar's trying to help Felix get his obsessive-compulsive disorder (the only sickness Felix really DOES have) under control. I truly believe that if married couples watched this movie together and kept an open mind, they'd realize just how much they have in common with the Odd Couple. Each of them tries to hide their humanity deep within, as was prevalent with the times. The movie set the stage for a successful television spin off, but there is nothing like the original movie, save the stage performance which, sadly, is long gone, though pieces of it may be seen on YouTube.
