He is a very happy scientist that loves his wife and job working for the government. It is the future, and a band of violent aliens is trying to destroy the human race, but we have been resilient. We have built walls over our skies and continually send pilots to attempt to bring down their star ships. This story takes place somewhere in the middle of this chaotic war, where fear becomes a bigger enemy than ally. D'Onofrio plays Hathaway, the leader of a government elite unit specializing in locating spies &#150; and he has found a target &#150; Olham. Hathaway believes that Olham is an android of the human he once was, disguised to allow for easy infiltration and destruction. Hathaway's mission is to destroy this clone, and while he wasn't successful in the past, he knows the truth now. Of course, Sinise is Sinise, and for nearly two hours he runs, inspects, and prepares for what should be the truth &#150; but instead we are handed a diabolical twist that will make any childless film buff happy and any anti-Sinise fan jump for joy. We are left with a vision that is as stunning as it is disturbing, yet for me, I was disappointed. I loved the ending, but questioned the value of the preceding hour of stock running footage. The DVD itself contains the short film that this film was based on, and I must admit, I liked that a bit more because it cut the center filler out, but also eliminated the illusionist-character element that filled the time slot. It was a give or take, but as you watch the ending, you question the need for it.I can't give the ending away, so I will divert the conversation elsewhere. Loved the introduction to this film. The history lesson coupled with an opening chapter that slowly fed you subliminal clues to the past. The John Hooker song got my feet bouncing and my juxtaposed mind in gear. Even in the future they listen to great music. The relationship between Sinise and Stowe could have been warmer, the introduction was sensual, but not worth 45 minutes of fighting for. I could not believe they were husband and wife for the brief moments that we saw them together. The struggle with the situation that occurs to Nelson Gittes (played by Tony Shalhoub) again seemed very underplayed. I wanted to see a stronger bond, and not just two sentences of dialog that would attempt to bring to the surface a life long relationship. I loved D'Onofrio, but that has already been said. Mekhi Phifer was just filler, the typical stranger that finds that warm patch in his heart to help a total stranger. We have seen that in any other Hollywood puzzler, and for this film it was no different. So, what I am trying to say is that the acting isn't what stands out with this film, it is the story.We all know that PK Dick can write an amazing story that withstands the vaults of time, and this is no exception. When you begin watching the film, you may assume you have seen the action before, in other films. You will be half right, until you witness the surprising ending. I thought I had it figured out, but what happened continues to keep a smile on my face. What I missed about this story was the war itself, yet eerily, I liked the internal struggle. I was very reminiscent of what is occurring in our world today. The tale of an overprotective government that is too worried about the treat instead of its people. I wish we could have seen more about the big weapon that was going to be a turning point to the war, I think that would have explained the choice for Olham to be targeted &#150; but again, with the shabby acting and stronger story, you have a mixed message that gets sent. The focus becomes blurry and this small review found the short story\/film to be stronger than the final verdict. A smaller scale sometimes paint a bolder picture.Overall, I thought this was a decent film for the small amount of screen time it was given. It kept my attention, while using techniques that are overused in Hollywood, but with Impostor it didn't feel used. Something felt fresh about this film, and while I know it wasn't the small actors giving less than 100%, or the overly sweaty Sinise, I think it was the voice and power behind D'Onofrio's character. Honestly, I am not drooling here, but he was great in this film. He was fun, angry, poised, and yet seemingly disturbed all at the right moments. Impostor is not a film that I think is a staple of the genre in any way, but it is a sinful delight that surprised me through the end. I would recommend this to friends, but only good friends. Alas, it won't be making my collection, but wouldn't mind catching it on network television one late night. Could I be any more vague? Oh well, I am reopening Do Android's Dream of Electric Sheep?

With the further development of atomic weapons, and the beginning of the Space Age just six short years away, these fears were beginning to intensify. Many science-fiction films of the 1950s simply exploited this paranoia, using alien invasions as an allegory to a Soviet invasion (the excellent 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956)' being the most accomplished example). However, Robert Wise' science-fiction classic, 'The Day the Earth Stood Still,' is very much a cautionary tale, challenging the audience to consider what will become of humanity if we continue our current course, and pleading for a change in our destructive ways.The film gets straight into the action. Behind the opening credits, we briefly observe the approaching spacecraft's journey across the Universe, into the Milky Way, and towards a tiny planet Earth. The spacecraft steeps into our atmosphere, the clouds disperse and we glimpse the familiar open ocean. Radio and television stations announce the mysterious UFO's presence to the world. It travels at supersonic speed &#150; 4000 miles per hour &#150; and nobody can identify exactly what it is (to add another layer of reality, some of the era's most famous broadcast journalists were hired to provide cameos as themselves &#150; including Gabriel Heatter, H.V. Kaltenborn and Drew Pearson). Miraculously, the spacecraft slows above Washington D.C., and, to the horror of onlookers, lands dramatically on the Ellipse at President's Park.A curious crowd begins to gather around the mysterious craft; squadrons of heavily-armed army personnel cautiously surround it. Along the spacecraft's perfectly smooth body, an entrance opens and a ramp is lowered to the grass. A spaceman, dressed in a shiny, silver suit and accompanied by a massive impenetrable robot named Gort, steps out into the view of the stunned crowd. His first words are friendly and reassuring we have come to visit you in peace and with goodwill. Nevertheless, at the first sudden movement, a soldier's pistol is fired and the spaceman is struck. Already, Man is demonstrating his uncanny ability for destruction.As this mysterious spaceman, named Klaatu (Michael Rennie), reveals his intentions of saving the planet from potential obliteration, he is saddened to hear of the insurmountable gulfs between countries that hamper his plans. Embroiled in all their petty human politics, the countries of the world are simply unable to come to a mutual understanding, thus practically sealing their own demise. Klaatu quite easily flees from the detention of the hospital, assumes a new identity (as a Mr. Carpenter) and hires a room in a household full of with conspiracy theorists. It is here that he comes to know Helen Benson (Patricia Neal) and her son Bobby (Billy Gray).It is the latter who &#150; not knowing Klaatu's true identity &#150; suggests that he visit Prof. Jacob Barnhardt (Sam Jaffe), purportedly one of the most intelligent men in the world. There is a familiar way in which Klaatu smiles at Barnhardt's complex mathematical calculations on the blackboard, as one would smile at a child learning addition and subtraction. It reminds us that, even with all our technological advancement, we are still but children in the eyes of the Universe. Nevertheless, Klaatu decides that, if anything is to be done to save the fate of the planet, it must take place through men whose judgment is not clouded by government policies and petty prejudices. He must approach the scientists of the world, the scholars of art, philosophy and culture; those whose only concern is the search for knowledge and happiness. It is not the bickering governments who will play any large part in this tale &#150; the President of the United States doesn't even earn himself an appearance &#150; but the uncorrupted hearts and minds of the rational thinkers.'The Day The Earth Stood Still' was adapted by Edmund H. North from Harry Bates' short story 'Farewell to the Master.' In the original story's shock ending, it is revealed that, contrary to initial belief, it is the robot Gort (named Gnut in the story) who is the master, and Klaatu who is the servant. This ending is not clearly addressed in the film itself &#150; though Klaatu does declare that, in order to maintain universal peace, they created a race of robots and, in matters of aggression, gave them absolute power of everyone, even over their creators. Despite this, Klaatu is inarguably given the role of a Messiah, most prominently by featuring a resurrection scene, and also by his choice of alias &#150; Jesus himself was a carpenter by trade.Countless later science-fiction films owe a lot to 'The Day The Earth Stood Still.' Roland Emmerich's 1996 blockbuster 'Independence Day' borrowed heavily from it, and acknowledges this by briefly featuring a clip from the film itself. The hysteria and confusion arising from the sudden loss of electricity and transport no doubt inspired Steven Spielberg for his 2005 remake of 'The War of the Worlds.' Most significantly, this film strongly reflects many of the cultural fears inherent in that era. One elderly female conspiracy theorist declares if you want my opinion, he (Klaatu) comes from right here on Earth. And you know where I mean. Yes, we immediately do. This paranoia between the two feuding powers is explicitly shown to be the main reason why Klaatu's initial peace proposal was a failure, as neither was able to reach an acceptable peace compromise by which the visitor's proposition could be heard.

It travels at supersonic speed &#150; 4000 miles per hour &#150; and nobody can identify exactly what it is (to add another layer of reality, some of the era's most famous broadcast journalists were hired to provide cameos as themselves &#150; including Gabriel Heatter, H.V. Kaltenborn and Drew Pearson). Miraculously, the spacecraft slows above Washington D.C., and, to the horror of onlookers, lands dramatically on the Ellipse at President's Park.A curious crowd begins to gather around the mysterious craft; squadrons of heavily-armed army personnel cautiously surround it. Along the spacecraft's perfectly smooth body, an entrance opens and a ramp is lowered to the grass. A spaceman, dressed in a shiny, silver suit and accompanied by a massive impenetrable robot named Gort, steps out into the view of the stunned crowd. His first words are friendly and reassuring we have come to visit you in peace and with goodwill. Nevertheless, at the first sudden movement, a soldier's pistol is fired and the spaceman is struck. Already, Man is demonstrating his uncanny ability for destruction.As this mysterious spaceman, named Klaatu (Michael Rennie), reveals his intentions of saving the planet from potential obliteration, he is saddened to hear of the insurmountable gulfs between countries that hamper his plans. Embroiled in all their petty human politics, the countries of the world are simply unable to come to a mutual understanding, thus practically sealing their own demise. Klaatu quite easily flees from the detention of the hospital, assumes a new identity (as a Mr. Carpenter) and hires a room in a household full of with conspiracy theorists. It is here that he comes to know Helen Benson (Patricia Neal) and her son Bobby (Billy Gray).It is the latter who &#150; not knowing Klaatu's true identity &#150; suggests that he visit Prof. Jacob Barnhardt (Sam Jaffe), purportedly one of the most intelligent men in the world. There is a familiar way in which Klaatu smiles at Barnhardt's complex mathematical calculations on the blackboard, as one would smile at a child learning addition and subtraction. It reminds us that, even with all our technological advancement, we are still but children in the eyes of the Universe. Nevertheless, Klaatu decides that, if anything is to be done to save the fate of the planet, it must take place through men whose judgment is not clouded by government policies and petty prejudices. He must approach the scientists of the world, the scholars of art, philosophy and culture; those whose only concern is the search for knowledge and happiness. It is not the bickering governments who will play any large part in this tale &#150; the President of the United States doesn't even earn himself an appearance &#150; but the uncorrupted hearts and minds of the rational thinkers.'The Day The Earth Stood Still' was adapted by Edmund H. North from Harry Bates' short story 'Farewell to the Master.' In the original story's shock ending, it is revealed that, contrary to initial belief, it is the robot Gort (named Gnut in the story) who is the master, and Klaatu who is the servant. This ending is not clearly addressed in the film itself &#150; though Klaatu does declare that, in order to maintain universal peace, they created a race of robots and, in matters of aggression, gave them absolute power of everyone, even over their creators. Despite this, Klaatu is inarguably given the role of a Messiah, most prominently by featuring a resurrection scene, and also by his choice of alias &#150; Jesus himself was a carpenter by trade.Countless later science-fiction films owe a lot to 'The Day The Earth Stood Still.' Roland Emmerich's 1996 blockbuster 'Independence Day' borrowed heavily from it, and acknowledges this by briefly featuring a clip from the film itself. The hysteria and confusion arising from the sudden loss of electricity and transport no doubt inspired Steven Spielberg for his 2005 remake of 'The War of the Worlds.' Most significantly, this film strongly reflects many of the cultural fears inherent in that era. One elderly female conspiracy theorist declares if you want my opinion, he (Klaatu) comes from right here on Earth. And you know where I mean. Yes, we immediately do. This paranoia between the two feuding powers is explicitly shown to be the main reason why Klaatu's initial peace proposal was a failure, as neither was able to reach an acceptable peace compromise by which the visitor's proposition could be heard. Mankind's primitive tendency towards violence, throughout the film, threatens to destroy any chance of its continuing existence, though the ending is deliberately left very open ending, as if the ultimate choice is left to the viewers themselves.

Sure Babe Ruth was coming into his own by 1920, but most ballplayers in that era would not have place Ruth in the class of Cobb, Tris Speaker or Walter Johnson. For baseball fans, this line in particular really comes off as shallow, especially since the rest of the film really tries to capture the dead-ball era. For the most part though, this film feels and sounds a lot like America right after World War I ends, a fascinating time and place.Studs Terkel steals the show in my estimation. His character in the film is not far from whom he is in real life and his authenticity is undeniable. John Sayles is a little stiff by comparison and his singing in the railway car (which according to legend did actually happen), is rather difficult to bear. None the less, his direction makes up for his foibles as an actor.Straitharn is another gem in this movie, and once again this actor seems to get right to the soul of the characters he is given to play. Eddie Cicotte's dilemmas are written all over Straitharn's face in every scene, he's also given some of the best dialog in the film. Cusack plays his part well, despite the fact that many of his scenes are reduced to clichés. Cusack's best moments are when he is frustrated about his inclusion in the conspiracy trial, despite the fact he gave his all to try and win the series. His outbursts in the courtroom seem perfect, as if drawn from the trial transcripts themselves.Joe Jackson is given unfair treatment. If Field of Dreams mythologizes Jackson to point of hyperbole, Eight Men Out plays up his illiteracy with too much of a heavy hand. Joe Jackson wasn't stupid, indeed if you read his last major interview before he died, he speaks about the Black Sox with great alacrity and clarity. He was not as ignorant as this film would have you believe. One day someone will produce a film about Joe Jackson, that will portray him accurately, but Eight Men Out is not that film.Although their roles are very minor, Kid Gleason and Ray Schalk are really well played and written. These two went through a very difficult time during the series, and this is well demonstrated. One minor beef is that Nemo Leibold, Shano Collins and other players outside of the conspiracy are never touched upon at all. This is understandable to a degree given the relatively short length of the film, despite the complexity of the subject matter.The baseball scenes themselves are well done. The bats, balls, gloves and uniforms look like the equipment of that era and the ballparks are successful mock ups for the most part. There are even a couple of nifty athletic displays in the outfield that must have taken several takes to pull off.Overall, this is my second favorite baseball movie, next to Bull Durham. Its a little light on some of the details of the conspiracy, but it makes up for it in other areas. It has some great music, some great sets, some solid acting and overall seems genuine and fair to all the major players in the conspiracy.Eight Men Out isn't perfect, but it isn't as flawed as Roger Ebert would have you believe. If you a fan of baseball in fact, I'd say its mandatory viewing.

When seeing the movie, I have to confess that I liked the film more than the play. Comparing the movie with the play in accuracy is quite close, almost exact. Not only did bring the film to life on picture, but also added and grew more in-depth in the thin layer of witch-hunting, but the hardcore of fraud and vengeance.The Crucible is about the Salem witch trials back in the late 1600s of where mass hysteria erupted from a small number of girls who claim they were bewitched by other members in the town, which led to the deaths of twenty people. There is no proof or real evidence as to why the girls acted, and made wide accusations so pervasively and heartlessly. But the play, even more so with the movie reveals the dark side of the brutal truth.Abigail Williams (Winona Rider) and a handful of other girls were caught dancing and supposedly committing sacrifices and other demonic rituals. After each being persistently and mercilessly interrogated, the girls, (with Abigail as the leader), start saying other people's names in order to evade their troubles. Here on, paranoia and disillusion develops as the girls grow bewitched, in which the townsfolk believe in. Basically, they put on a class act, manipulating the court system not only to get out of harsh punishments or gain their fame, but to seek vengeance upon those in the town that harmed and\/or despised them.You listen upon a whore! God is dead! shouts a condemned Procter, instantly giving the message of the tale. In the end, the Innocent die, and those who try to speak the truth of the hoax also die. The film shows well of man's ignorance to reason, as well as inhumanity to their fellow neighbor. But even more so, the real moral is when vengeance and greed clouds the minds of those who lived. In the end, the politics and the manipulative girls are the winners. The performances were outstanding. Winona Rider, even though I don't fancy her much, gave a very manipulative and cunning performance that I haven't seen since Meiko Harado as Lady Kaede in Kurosawa's Ran. Abigail does it all to seek the heart of a married man John Procter (Daniel-Day Lewis). Once again, Mr. Lewis gives a compelling and heart-wrenching performance as Procter, who would do anything to find the truth and save the town, as well as his friends, from destruction and madness. There were many other faces that were great, including Eric Schofield, Joan Allen, Bruce Davison, and Rob Campbell.Apart from the great acting and solid story, the film also held good film-making quality, such as the mellow dramatic score, the proper setting (including costume, being filmed on the actual location, and the set-decoration). However, the actual directing was weak. Instead of having up-close shots like Peter Jackson, wide-ranged, distant shots like Kurosawa, or even a hand-held or shaky camera movement like Paul Greengrass, the camera was stiff. It was as if the director only wanted to show the story in an audience perspective, not trying to pull the audience into it. Added to this, the pace for the two hour film dragged a bit.But do not be disheartened by these flaws, for The Crucible is a great film based off of a great and unforgettable\/unforgivable story of lies, deceit, paranoia, disillusion, and death. 4\/5 You covet what you see-Hannibal Lector ","genre":null},{"date":"13 April 2007","score":"","review":" After just reading the play by Arthur Miller, I felt moved by its gripping story.

When seeing the movie, I have to confess that I liked the film more than the play. Comparing the movie with the play in accuracy is quite close, almost exact. Not only did bring the film to life on picture, but also added and grew more in-depth in the thin layer of witch-hunting, but the hardcore of fraud and vengeance.The Crucible is about the Salem witch trials back in the late 1600s of where mass hysteria erupted from a small number of girls who claim they were bewitched by other members in the town, which led to the deaths of twenty people. There is no proof or real evidence as to why the girls acted, and made wide accusations so pervasively and heartlessly. But the play, even more so with the movie reveals the dark side of the brutal truth.Abigail Williams (Winona Rider) and a handful of other girls were caught dancing and supposedly committing sacrifices and other demonic rituals. After each being persistently and mercilessly interrogated, the girls, (with Abigail as the leader), start saying other people's names in order to evade their troubles. Here on, paranoia and disillusion develops as the girls grow bewitched, in which the townsfolk believe in. Basically, they put on a class act, manipulating the court system not only to get out of harsh punishments or gain their fame, but to seek vengeance upon those in the town that harmed and\/or despised them.You listen upon a whore! God is dead! shouts a condemned Procter, instantly giving the message of the tale. In the end, the Innocent die, and those who try to speak the truth of the hoax also die. The film shows well of man's ignorance to reason, as well as inhumanity to their fellow neighbor. But even more so, the real moral is when vengeance and greed clouds the minds of those who lived. In the end, the politics and the manipulative girls are the winners. The performances were outstanding. Winona Rider, even though I don't fancy her much, gave a very manipulative and cunning performance that I haven't seen since Meiko Harado as Lady Kaede in Kurosawa's Ran.

Having consistently given 100% of his talent over a long career, he is among a very small group of actors in any language who evoke epithets that verge on hero worship. He takes us to places in human experience that we often are too timid to explore on our own and we gratefully acknowledge the courage, we are thankful for having it portrayed for us. Unlike Brando, who hated what he was best at, Pacino continues to shine on, using his demons to craft and create penetrating and powerful re-creations of humanity, often on a large scale.The premise of this film is quite believable. Pacino's character is so burnt out that at any moment we expect him to either shoot at someone (a version of a blind mans 'road rage') or else see him destroy himself. And, this is the thread that runs through his character until the very end - but I won't spoil that. Pacino's character is meaty, deep, troubled, worldly, street wise, tough, bitter, frustrated. In short, many facets that sound a lot like Pacino. Would it then surprise us so much that his performance is so volcanic, cutting, as it probably does, closer to his own soul than we know? A true mensch of the method school, he has dug into his own essence and what comes pouring out is so hot that Pacino just overwhelms the picture with his presence. There is in his character so much potential, but did you notice that we do not know all that much about him? He was a tough ass army man, attached to waiting on Lyndon Johnson. He relates the story several times in the movie but I get the impression that he hated this type of army service. He also reveals that he had first hand knowledge of the gory mess of war, perhaps in Vietnam. Again, we are not given too many details and we do not learn all that much about him. What we do know is that because of a foolish act (perhaps in a drunken state) he ended up blinding himself in an accident. The more we watch Pacino's character unwind, the more we (can) assume that this event might have much more to do with his incipient self-destructive (perhaps self-loathing) demons, than merely an accident. Did he want to blind himself, having just seen enough and having taken in enough pain for one lifetime? It's worth considering. Again, we do know that he is embittered and that his vision went from partial vision to total blindness over the last half year. So, when his young student shows up to take care of him over a weekend, he has arrived when the earthquakes have already been coming on and the full volcano is now erupting. Pacino's character has tipped over the edge and is ready to exit his pain. That he comes to change his mind is a surprise both to us and to him. Chris O'Donnell as Charlie Simms both irritated and then satisfied me. I was at first put off by how weak he seemed. Sure he had to face a furnace and his lines were not confrontational. He was supposed to be young, fresh, inexperienced, naive, etc. What I found a bit disappointing is that O'Donnell was either too young an actor or too shallow for the role. He just wilted under the withering storms that Pacino kept expelling. Pacino had little trouble mopping the floor with this young guy and after a while we just wished that some spine would be found to stand up and push back. Nothing. Later in the film I decided that to accept that Simms was just that young, tender and just not blackened by the torment that inhabited Pacino's character. The contrast is a weakness in the film and it could have been even finer had the director urged O'Donnell to put up some resistance and thrown a few left hooks. Leaving this weakness aside, the story as it is keeps you glued to your chair. The thanksgiving dinner Pacino suckers O'Donnell into taking him to adds layers of self-loathing to his character. Had he gone ahead with his original plans, he would have left his family with the iron clad conviction that this was one bad dude, one hateful shell of a man that thankfully was no longer in their lives to dirty their shadows with. As he leaves the dinner, having upset everyone as much as possible, he pauses to admit to his brother I'm no good, never was. Later in the film when he shouts out I'm in the dark here we now know it's a very lonely and hateful darkness and in this space almost anything can come about. Just like you can say ...there was a lot of love to share, this was a man with a lot of rage to share and share it he insisted on. The school-court scene is of course where Pacino makes a surprise visit. His speech, quoted by everyone, just about burns the house down, as he laments he would have done five years earlier. The beauty of this film takes place at that moment; he has clearly saved much more than Charlie Simms. He has saved his own soul, which was so much convinced that a final leap into the dark hole of death was the only answer left in a life turned cancerous. That moment is the catharsis we hoped for and we leave the film feeling sure that two good men will not take the road to oblivion. The road to perdition was transformed to the road to salvation. What a film. Pacino so deserved the Oscar. May he gain more.

They shared the same anarchist tendencies to push the limits of taste, and not only challenged what was morally acceptable, but artistically. They had the same obsession with over-the-top grandiose and baroque set pieces that always seemed oddly stagy, as if the whole movie was taking place beneath the proscenium of an enormous opera house. These director's work in symbol and metaphor, and possess a certain crazed wit and artistry and a keen eye for the outlandish.Gore Vidal clearly intended a more serious, though not necessarily less extreme, story of the dehumanizing nature of absolute power. Anti-establishment mavericks, Brass and McDowell were more interested in exploring the idea of Caligula as a revolutionary anarchist, an anti-hero (much like Little Alex) trying to dismantle and destroy the bureaucratic institutions of power, only to find that those institutions are able to crush even the cruelest of tyrants.Of course the whole thing would have been wildly tasteless and over-the-top had the slimy Bob Guccione never gotten involved. It was clearly Brass and McDowell's intent to produce a shocking, outrageous, almost psychedelic, and thoroughly offensive piece of work. That's not a bad thing if it's for a just cause, but any illusions of political commentary that Brass and McDowell intended is obscured by the heavy handed, self-serving agenda of Bob Guccione.From the outset, whether the others involved really knew it or not, his intention for 'Caligula' was to bring adult entertainment to the masses; pornography in to the multiplex; and he brought on board the latest Penthouse pets to costar. Their are those who refuse to call the offending scenes in this movie pornographic, though it's tough to imagine what else you call multiple close-ups of blow jobs and masturbation. Perhaps Brass and McDowell underestimated him and thought they could take his money and retain some creative control. They didn't. Throughout the movie, the dull and heavy hand of Guccione can be seen everywhere. You only have to compare the gleeful fun and theatrical shocks of the Tiberian Grotto scene to the later dull and boring porn inserts to see the difference between the two directors. Where Brass attempts eroticism, Gucionne goes for porn. Where Brass injects wit and humor, Gucionne in boringly earnest. Where Brass in inventive, Gucionne is dull and repetitive.What could have been a shocking, but provocative, art house commentary on the indestructibility of bourgeois rule, was turned in to a crude exercise in the most dull and tedious kind of porn. There's enough of Brass's original vision to keep things interesting. It's not for the feint-hearted, but fans of Ken Russel, and later, Peter Greenaway, may appreciate the sheer insane spectacle of it all.

'Human Nature' suffered from high expectations - after 'Being John Malkovich' everybody expected another brain-bending masterpiece, and instead received a subtle, wry and quietly philosophical comedy, open to all kinds of interpretation and featuring beautiful, under-appreciated performances from Patricia Arquette, Tim Robbins and Rhys Ifans.Lila Jute (Patricia Arquette) suffers from a hormonal problem that causes hair to grow all over her body, which first appeared in her pre-teens. Convinced by her mother that she would never get a man, Lila went to live in the woods among the animals, and become a nature writer. The books were successful, and in her new found fame, Lila could afford to become a hairless lie; to get electrolysis. Through Louise, who performs the electrolysis, Lila meets Dr. Nathan Bronfman, a bespectacled manners-obsessed virgin and scientist, currently working on a large sociological project involving mice. Lila and Nathan are immediately attracted to each other, and are soon living together. One day, on a hike in the woods, the pair discover a human raised by a man who thought he was an ape, completely uncontaminated by civilisation. Nathan decides the man needs to experience civilisation (Never to know the love of a good woman or appreciate the complex works of Moby Dick or marvel at Monet?), and decides to 'save' him, by teaching him manners and decorum.What results from the oddball plot is a hilarious and occasionally touching investigation into human nature, that doesn't just come right out and say, Humans are deceitful and always will be! or the like, but leaves it up to you to decide.Patricia Arquette gives a sincere performance, and provides the most touching moments in the film. She shows incredible range in this film; from her naive desire to please Nathan by becoming a real girl, wearing pink, painting her nails and taking up ballet, to becoming a warrior. Lila is vulnerable when she is with Nathan, but she transforms herself (with the help of Louise) and becomes strong and confident.Tim Robbins is convincing as a bordering obsessive compulsive, and shows great comedic timing in the first few scenes with Patricia Arquette. It was an interesting choice to have Tim Robbins talk about his actions in retrospect, and then see him act them out with pure selfishness and inability to control his lusting.Rhys Ifan's performance as Puff is the same standard as Arquette's. He demonstrates a large range; from an 'ape' to the apex of 'refinement'. There is one scene in particular, where footage of Puff as an 'ape' is shown, while the reformed Puff stands calmly as it plays, knowingly, in a very civilised suit.'Human Nature' is a bit of a mixed bag film - it even morphs into a musical for a moment near the beginning, in a song sung by Patricia Arquette herself (what a beautiful, restrained voice!). Sometimes it's surreal, as with the scene I mentioned in the last paragraph. The humour in the film is mostly created by scenes where the flaws of humankind are exposed - our indifference, how we pretend to be something we're not, how we like to separate ourselves from nature even though that's where we came from, before civilisation.I love the open-endedness of this film! It is the best thing about it. Also, I enjoyed Gondry's sneaky references to Bjork's 'Human Behaviour' video clip.

Surly today's directors can draw upon previous movie scripts if no more than to see how well they are constructed. And no script was more in it's craft that Joseph L. Mankiewicz's All About Eve. I could also point out Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity and a few others but All About Eve is one one Mankiewicz's best, along with A Letter to Three Wives and the charming People Will Talk. But, as many a poster knows All About Eve garnered 14 academy award nominations, winning 6. Bette Davis was robbed! Sure, Gloria Swanson was dazzling in Sunset Boulevard but she didn't have the competition Miss Davis had in All About Eve. There was Anne Baxter reprising a similar role she played in the 1944 film Guest in the House. And George Sanders playing a variation of his role in The Picture of Dorian Gray. I think the academy members gave him his award for his magnificent body of work. His award was well deserved. But miss Baxter couldn't hold a candle to Miss Davis who essayed her role in 14 days. And out of sequence. The first scene filmed for the movie was Miss Davis encountering Addison De Witt in the lobby of the theatre. The producers could only get the theatre for a certain time not on it's schedule so did what it had to do. Film that scene. The interior of the theatre scene was filmed at a later date. Many people don't know that Hollywood is a very small town. And the academy award members is not a large body at all, maybe a little over two thousand. But at that time the members had long memories and since Miss Davis was no longer Queen of Hollywood let alone under a contract to a major studio they knew they had no allegiance to her. She had stepped on too many academy members toes, and some still felt the sting. Gloria Swanson, well, she just came out of retirement for this one film and so they felt no allegiance to her, either. Neither studio backed the two stars. And the award went to Judy Holliday for a very boring movie called Born Yesterday. A role that Miss Holliday had performed on Broadway many many time. It's hard to watch Born Yesterday today and you really wonder why the members didn't give the academy award to Miss Davis. All About Eve is a timeless movie, a classic and a gem and the towering performance in the entire film is by Bette Davis. To go further in the case of vendetta, the members did give Katherine Hepburn an award for her unforgettable performance in The Lion in Winter but to make sure Davis couldn't catch Hepburn she got another award for the insipid Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, a role not worthy of an academy award.

Over 1,400 extras were used, and a suit of armor had to be made for each. Some 200 horses were used. The stunts also are amazing... there had to be some bones broken when you see these guys falling off their horses at a full run. There's another scene where an infantry soldier tries to get out of the way of a cavalryman thundering toward him, and the horse's breast hits him full in the chest, sending him flying.There a really memorable scene where Kurosawa has built a $1.5M replica of a castle, and burns it to the ground. The sight of the castle, fully engulfed, and Hidetora walking down the steps in his descent toward madness, has to be one of the best all-time film scenes.My only criticism is the length - it lags a couple of times.

He is now ready to pass on his castles and lands to his three sons, and wants his legacy to be one of peace. But the three sons quickly become enemies as they vie for power, and plunge the kingdom into chaos and war.The plot and characters are brilliantly adapted from King Lear - the plot is complex and characters' fates intertwine with one another beautifully.Ran is beautifully shot - it is set in a mountainous region of Kyushu Island, and it makes you want to travel there. The sight of dozens of cavalrymen dressed in 16th century armor, thundering across ridges and fording rivers, sends chills up your spine.The jester is brilliant in the alternating roles of caregiving and ridiculer of the aging Hidetora, and has a knack for coming up with lines both amusing and deeply illuminating.The battle scenes are incredible.

I'm being lenient I think to many people by giving this an eight, and I completely understand the people that tear it to shreds. But I have a soft spot saved for Hitchcock's 'Spellbound', as I do for all of his pictures. There is always SOMETHING, if the actor is miscast, maybe the script will make up for it, if the picture is dull, perhaps the cinematography is great, if all else fails there will no doubt be some clever editing to help you through it. Hitchcock always tried to cover every open door by letting the audience know that no matter what, what you are watching is a Hitchcock picture. In this case, the film is worth watching for the production design and the extended dream sequences created by Salvador Dali, however lacks in story line and Gregory Peck was , in my opinion, terribly miscast. Even Ingrid Bergman, who is rarely in a film that is below her, gives a laughable performance, literally, like when Peck asks nonchalantly before a picnic, 'what's for lunch?' and she responds, beaming, 'Liverwurst!' then fades to black. I could never tell if this was meant to be funny or not, but it certainly brings a lot of laughs in a film that is supposed to be taken seriously. Still, it is very interesting for it's technical achievements, and camera-work, and for Dali's contribution which was almost novelty but quite surreal unlike anything else found in a Hitchcock film.

However, for me, I can't see why this is among the very highest rated Bogart films on IMDb. Of course CASABLANCA is rated highest (this is no surprise), but I actually preferred a few of Bogart's less famous films over THE MALTESE FALCON (such as THE CAINE MUTINY). Instead of discussing all that has already been stated in many other reviews, I'll explain the one failing I noticed in this otherwise exceptional film. Despite the film being Noir, it had a surprisingly small amount of action and towards the end, it is way too talky as they explained the plot--sort of like they were filling in the missing pieces--most of which seemed like guesswork on Sam Spade's part. I really think the script could have been tightened up in this regard. Still, with exceptional supporting actors, a great cynical performance by Bogie AND the best last ten minutes you'll find in almost any film, it still is an exceptional film--well worth seeing.Also, I recently saw the 1931 MALTESE FALCON starring Ricardo Cortez. While Cortez was not as exciting in the lead as Bogart, the film was in many places word-for-word the same film. Dudley Diggs' version of the Fat Man was also essentially copied by Sidney Greenstreet a decade later.By the way, I have never seen an explanation for this, but I noticed one odd thing about the film. When Sidney Greenstreet is slashing at the statue and yelling, the voice does not appear to be his but was dubbed by another actor. I've seen the film several times and last time I even reviewed this scene and it just doesn't sound like him (actually, it sounds a little like Claude Rains). I assume it was inserted sloppily later but am surprised others didn't point this out as well. If you can help explain this, drop me a line.

When his house is robbed-not once-but twice-he decides enough is enough and decides to run for DA.From the outset Wilby is faced with two problems-first, is to try to defeat the incumbent DA-Honest John Slade(Keenan Wynn). John Slade is anything but honest-he is allowing crooks off the hook by not prosecuting them or letting them off easy. One of these crooks is Eddie Roschak(Vic Tayback-in a much more realistic portrayal of a bad guy than in No deposit, no Return).Wilby's Second and much more serious problem-is that the Borger ring has been stolen from the museum-and whenever someone reads the inscription on the ring-Wilby is transformed in to a shaggy dog-that belongs to Tim-the ice cream man(Tim Conway). THe dog's name is Elwood Wilby's Wife is Betty(Suzanne Pleshette)and they have a son, whom I call the wisecracking Brian(Shane Sinutko). His wife becomes his campaign manager.John Slade gets hold of the ring and tries to blackmail Daneils out of the race by threatening to keep reading the inscription on the ring over & over again to keep Daniels as a dog.

This is one of the better comedies offered by Disney in the 70's.So, why do I vote 8 instead of 10? Well-the movie doesn't answer the questions I have 1.

I know that in the 1959 original-Daneils finds the ring and he reads the inscription and turns into a dog. That maybe the answer-but the fact remains-not everyone who reads the inscription turns into a dog. I think there must be something else-a family trait or curse or something that only happens to Daniels and no one else.Overall, this is a real good movie with a fine cast and directed by Disney's Ledgendary director Robert Stevenson.
