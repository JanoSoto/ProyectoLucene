You may stone me now, but the theme of Network, like Taxi Driver, revolves around alienation.POSSIBLE SPOILERFinch's remarks can be boiled down to this theme, specifically why he threatens suicide; without his job, his life is meaningless.  Of course this is drowned out by his rage, rage at everyone and everything, much like the line after, You talking to me? in Taxi Driver.No, the plot revolves around Dunaway's character - amoral, ambitious, and without a genuine place in society, and her foil, the seduced Holden. Dunaway is alone in a self-created world with a sole goal of the acquisition of ratings.  She practically has an orgasim in the office describing her ideas for the Mao Tse Tung Hour, and later she climaxes to it.  Her world is the office, no need for a personal life.Holden exists in that world too, but he knows it's just a job.  Throughout Holden brings this world of memories, feelings, and real life to the office, to his home, to his friends, and to Dunaway, and this is where the value of the movie goes beyond its surface of a prophetic warning about declining TV standards.  Here we have a clash of world-views, Montaigne vs. Marx one says that man is more than the sum of his parts, the other denies precisely that.  Maybe it's her youth, maybe he sees potential, but Holden tries to save Dunaway from herself.  Dunaway can't see her problem, she believes life is a story line, as though it's nothing to be concerned about; I see her one day shouting from the rooftops, I'm mad as H---, and I'm not going to take it anymore, as she comprehends her situation, but until she understands that life is more complex than a Tolstoy novel, Holden can't help her. That's the darkness of Network, Beale is just the clown around the center ring.
