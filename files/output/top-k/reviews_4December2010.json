I saw Airplane many years ago, I saw Scary Movie 3 and 4 in the theaters, and saw Creepshow last fall. I didn't however see Nielsen's parody films which made him famous like The Naked Gun trilogy and Spy Hard. So I finally put one on to watch what I had missed...22 years later.It's true you don't know what you have until it's gone, and you appreciate it\/them more when they're gone. I knew who Corey Haim was before he died and saw License to Drive a couple months before his death, but became somewhat obsessed with him when he died. Same thing applies with Michael Jackson, Greg Giraldo, and a number of others. Leslie Nielsen may be a victim to my awkward obsession. After watching this gem, he very well could be. If that's a good thing.Leslie plays Frank Drebbin a policy officer who likes to think he is doing a good job, when really, he doesn't know what he is doing, and when he tries to do something good, he gets himself and others hurt. Drebbin now has to protect Queen Elizabeth II from being assassinated at a California Angels baseball game during the seventh inning stretch. Although the plot sounds very serious, it delivers an uncountable number of laughs in the process.Going into this, aware of it being a parody\/spoof film, I was nothing but skeptical. A parody film? Hasn't that genre been beaten, trashed, abused, and spat on by the duo of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer? But in the eighties and nineties, David Zucker knew how to be funny and original simultaneously. Rather than cramming over thirty pop culture characters\/references that, most of the time, lack a purpose or dimension, Zucker took in a cop that wanted to do the right thing but unknowingly made matters either unclear or even worse than they already were.The goal for a parody film is to make it play like a regular film. It's supposed to feel like an actual film, but it should poke fun at all of the movie clichés (i.e. comforting wife when husband was in ER). One cop would never bring up the worst possible outcomes that could happen to the wife when her husband is in the hospital bed near death. So in a nutshell, when constructing a parody film, don't focus on setting a record for the most pop culture characters utilized in an eighty minute film. Make it like a real film and just poke fun at common clichés.The Naked Gun is definitely a winner, and probably takes the cake for my favorite parody film. Leslie Nielsen's acting was memorable as well my first time seeing O.J. Simpson acting in anything. I never thought I'd say or type this but, we have a great parody film on our hands.Starring Leslie Nielsen, Priscilla Presley, Ricardo Montalbán, George Kennedy, O. J. Simpson, and Nancy Marchand.

I am writing this review in my thirties.This film is a suspense thriller and not a horror film.Examples of Stephen King horror films are The Dark Half, Graveyard Shift, The Langoliers, IT and Pet Cemetery. These films are classified as horror because they all deal with supernatural creatures.The theme of the film is a race for survival, a battle of wits and the battle between good and evil.Sheldon (James Caan) is good, and Wilkes (Bates) is evil embodied.Bestseller novelist Paul Sheldon (James Caan) is the writer of novels depicting a character, Misery Chastain that has become world famous. After finishing the manuscript of his latest novel, he leaves Silver Creek, Colorado to New York, but he is caught in a blizzard and his car sheers off the road. He is rescued in the nick of time by nurse Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates) and brought to her remote home. Both of Paul's legs are fractured, and he has a dislocated shoulder, leaving him bedridden and largely unable to move.Wilkes role in the film is that of a pure dictator. For a woman starved of a mans presence and touch for many years, she shows a real hatred towards all men. She is not at all aroused by Sheldon, who is a handsome man. So her character is that of a frigid woman - a woman devoid of any sexual appetite. Sheldon tries to seduce her, during a dinner with her but fails.Wilkes pride and joy are Sheldon's novels. After reading his manuscript of his latest book, Misery's Child, which Paul intends to be the final Misery novel, she flies into a rage, brandishing a small table on Paul's head. She masters her temper however, and tells him calmly that she never contacted the hospital, or anyone Paul knows as she earlier claimed to have done.And here is where the film really kicks into gear. The race for survival has begun.Sheldon shows more character than he is given. Not many man in his situation would have dared half the things he did in order to survive. I am reminded of a certain die-hard character....The way he crawls out from his bed in his fatal condition brought the tears in my eyes. And the pain he feels in this film is real.This film has a disturbing scene in it Wilkes breaks Sheldon's ankles with a sledgehammer in an act of hobbling. Those of you unfamiliar with the term can google it up. This method was used in the South African Diamond mines to discipline workers that stole diamonds. Wilkes explains this to Sheldon before she hobbles him.Won't say any more of the plot. You will have to see what happens next.
