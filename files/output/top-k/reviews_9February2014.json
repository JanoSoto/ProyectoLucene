I do love the sets, and the scope of showing the town, but the best thing about the original three-act play is that the play is performed without a set and the actors mime their actions without the use of props. Author, Thornton Wilder once said Our claim, our hope, our despair are in the mind &#x96; not in things, not in 'scenery.' Throughout the play, Wilder uses meta-theatrical devices, such as narration by a stage manager who tells them what they are seeing. Still, it's for the audience to use their imagination vision to put it in motion. In this movie, it's more set in stone, what the producers want us to see. Set in the fictional American small town of Grover's Corners, it tells the story of an average town's citizens in the early twentieth century as depicted through their everyday lives. Scenes from the town's history between the years of 1901 and 1913 are performed. The film mostly focus this same three act format. Act I Daily Life introduces the audience to the people living in Grover's Corners in 1901. There is a lot of filler scenes about minor characters that play no big part in the main plot. Honestly who cares about the newspaper boy and milk man? The only characters, the film should focus on, is the Webb and Gibbs households. William Holden and Martha Scott are pretty typecast as George Gibbs and Martha Scott. They are too old to play teenagers, and the dialogue between them is wooden and dull. The movie is a bit boring, watching somebody mundane life that you're asking yourself. What is the point of this? I shouldn't be watching this? I'm wasting life, here! I think the only thing that was interesting and tense, was portraying young people prepare to wed. The second act is badly written in both the play, and the film. I don't care that Our Town won Pulitzer Prize; the flashbacks written sucks. It really hurt the already slow pacing being out of order. Once again, you're asking yourself, why am I watching this? Another thing, the movie does is talk about eternity in a lengthy monologue. I like it, but I was hoping a 'show, don't tell'. This movie and play is so tell to the point, it makes us look like clueless idiots. It's really dark story, but it does have a good message in the end. The ending to the film is way different than that of the play. There have been a lot of irate critics about the change in the ending. This part of the film, I think its works. The play has such a cynical ending. In 1946, the Soviet Union prevented a production of Our Town in the Russian sector of occupied Berlin, on the grounds that the drama is too depressing and could inspire a German suicide wave. I think the movie did better to show the message of living each day the fullest message than the play. I have to say the Stage Manager (Frank Craven) was pretty good in this movie, but I have to say, the 2003's remake with Paul Newman is the one worth watching. Even the 1977's version with Hal Halbrooks works a lot better than this. The Stage Manager plays as a God-like symbol. Although Our Town avoids discussion of religion, Wilder hints that a spiritual entity manages human life in much the same way that the Stage Manager dictates the flow of this play. I do like the freedom of breaking the fourth wall with him walking in and out of scenes, asking questions to the audience, and telling characters to shut up. It's rare to see this in 1940's movies and even rare to see it, today films. The movie hasn't aged well. The film is litter with scratches and marks. Even with playing it in my DVD player, I felt like any minute, the film was going to rip apart. One thing that I love about the film is the soundtrack. It's such a beautiful tune that I think the song will outlive the play in future time. In my opinion, Our Town could had been better written, even for the times, its set. Our Town would had shown life between and after the Industry Revolution Turn of the Century, a lot better with putting more immigrations, showing more technology etc. etc. Instead, the town is nearly the same from 1901 to 1913. The film lacks any social community. Despite the townspeople's well-meaning nature, they have only a limited ability or willingness to act or confront societal problems. It really limited the film. It's such a nostalgic archetype that reminds me of any town in America at the time to the point, it doesn't stand out. A mythical place where people are born, grow up, work, fall in love, get married, and die. Characters are archetypes, almost stereotypes, representing time-honored small town American ideals. It was somewhat mirror to a point, that Walt Disney model the design for Main Street USA in Disneyland. Perhaps a political message in itself, Our Town privileges the study of human life and its complexities over blatantly political works that point fingers, stereotype others, and otherwise divide people from one another. If only it focus less on main characters, and more on 'the town', it might had work. This movie should be the case study of society behind human trials and tribulations. Still, it lacks the very thing that makes a community study. Sorry, but our town is not my town.

The glorious tale of tragic love upon the maiden voyage of a doomed luxury liner. Every time I see Titanic, I see it in a new light, I notice something different that I never noticed before and I cry all over again.The beauty of a movie like this is that it has the ability to cripple the strongest of men with emotion. Being a skeptic on love myself, I have to say that I am slightly glad at Jack's demise not because he's a bad character (in fact he's my favorite character) but because there is some realism to that aspect of the story. Up until the doom of Titanic sets in, it's all very Romeo and Juliet, the obsessed illusion of true love after barely days of knowing each other, at least Rose is hesitant of it at first, whereas Jack is smitten beyond comprehension... Alas, their supposed true love does not overcome the wrath of a very angry looking iceberg and of course Ismay's blatant challenge to God and all elements of an unsinkable ship. That being said we all know the fate of Titanic but this is not what makes this movie so wonderful... it is actually the integration of all characters, both little and large, whether it be the distraught Murdock, the grief stricken captain EJ or the delightfully despicable Hockley... they all merge together in a beautiful picture.. while the main characters and those closest to them were made up and given a slightly mediocre presence, it all fits in so well, tragedy, love, jealousy, arrogance, greed, honor, dedication and lust all get together to dance upon the ship of dreams.Whether you're male or female I'm pretty sure the I want you to draw me like one of your french girls scene was a tasty reminder at how erotic cinema can be without actual sex. sensuality at it's tender best but not my favorite scene in the movie... the most notable scene for me in Titanic was when the poorer passengers accepted their fate of death, the Irish mother and her kids, the old couple that embrace as water floods around their bed... those were scenes dripping with emotion... My favorite scene however, is when Rose joins Jack below decks to party with the third class folk... just goes to show that money does not make-th the man, a good heart does.The marvel of the ship in all it's grandeur made me realize that Mister James Cameron is a visionary, the attention to detail of a simple thing like cutlery was admirable. Shining performances did not come from Dicaprio and Winslet as some foolish viewers believe the shining performers were Kathy Bates, Billy Zane,Frances Fisher and Gloria Stuart.I can go on about what a brilliant movie this is but I should not.End note, excellent movie that every person should see at least once before they die.

A melancholy piece of sentimental music plays over a black screen before being quickly drowned out by an explosion of upbeat disco. It's almost as though PT Anderson wanted the audience to feel like they just snorted a line of cocaine. The brilliant tracking shot that follows does a fantastic job of introducing all the characters, but it is that first screen that sets the tone; Boogie Nights is not about the glitz and glamor of its time period, but rather the sadness and desperation that lies beneath the gilded surface.The film follows a well-endowed and starry-eyed teenager named Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg), who escapes the turmoil of his home life by immersing himself in the sex and drug-fueled world of disco-dancing and hardcore pornography. Porn mogul Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds)and the sexy yet maternal Amber Waves (Julianne Moore)take Eddie under their wing, adopting him into their own twisted 'family', which Eddie is eager to join. As Eddie changes his persona to Dirk Diggler, the line between his real self and his on screen persona begins to blur, and the humbleness of his Eddie Adams is replaced by the ego-crazed arrogance of Dirk Diggler.After watching Boogie Nights time and time again, I have come to realize how truly unique it is in that the tonal shifts of the plot seem natural rather than jarring. There is a lot of humor in this movie, and at the same time a lot of sadness. Like all great filmmakers, PT Anderson is a master at playing with the audience's emotions. Boogie Nights, as well as his next film Magnolia, are emotional roller coaster rides. The key to mastering this is good characterization and seamless tonal shifts, both of which Boogie Nights succeeds in getting right.Tone is hard to define, but it can make or break a film. If a comedy is too serious, then it doesn't work. If a drama isn't taking itself seriously enough, then it doesn't work. Boogie Nights somehow manages to find that balance throughout its many tonal shifts, and for that it is a unique film watching experience.Perhaps the biggest strength in PT Anderson's films is his attention to detail in regards to his characters. In this ensemble cast, almost all of the characters undergo an emotional journeys of some sort. The fact that even the most ancillary characters have a storyline makes the film seem more realistic, and this makes it easier for the audience to sympathize with their struggles.The acting in the film is mostly superb, although truthfully I found a few scenes a bit too melodramatic. Mark Wahlberg did a good job, but in some scenes I feel he has a tendency to overact. However this is a minor gripe, and in the overall scheme he does a fantastic job revealing the emotional nuances of his character. John C. Reilly plays my favorite character in the film, Reed Rothschild, Dirk Diggler's best friend and eternal man-child.Julianne Moore gives a highly emotional and affecting performance, and Burt Reynolds is, for once, not completely annoying.On the contrary, he gives another fantastic performance. Heather Graham is great eye candy for the film, but her character has a lot more depth than her 'rollergirl' persona might suggest. In some ways I find her storyline more interesting than Dirk's.As someone who is a big fan of the music, films, and culture of the late 70's and early 80's, the setting of Boogie Nights appeals to me a great deal. The soundtrack is phenomenal, and the film uses it in some very unique ways. For example, who could forget Dirk's rendition of 'The Touch'? If you haven't seen the film yet, its worth watching for that scene alone! The film seems to have an appreciation for the time period, but also uses the changes of the period to represent changes in the characters, such as when the primary medium of porn changed from film to tape. This is masterfully done and a unique way to tell the story.Boogie Nights is a finely crafted and emotionally engaging film that engrosses you not only in its story, but in its characters and setting as well. Its one of those films you can watch time and time again and never get tired because there is simply so much to appreciate.

That little subplot, with the unknown outcome of theft, is all that kept this film together. And, it's what kept my interest in watching to the end. Otherwise, scenes of eating, drinking, and sex that repeat ad nauseam could hardly make for an interesting story.A few viewers saw something of social commentary in the movie -- that it poked fun at materialism. I didn't see that. What I did see seemed to be almost a celebration of hedonism and self-centeredness. The producers may have intended criticism of that way of living (I can't call it a lifestyle &#x96; while they lived it up in style, there was no real life in them). But that didn't come across as obvious. Whatever intent there may have been, the film seemed to me to be mostly about two people who lead hedonistic, pointless lives without regard to or consideration for other people. Indeed, their attitude toward all others in the hotel is demeaning and dismissive. Some reviewers commented on romance, comedy and the acting. The script clearly showed two people who didn't live for each other, but simply in companionship with one another. That's not love, but using. Is that the romance some saw? I didn't laugh once in this film, or even smile once. I didn't hear any real clever or witty dialog. If it was a satire, it was so far over my head (very possible, I admit) that I didn't get it. But, I don't think this film was quite that sophisticated. It just doesn't have any comedy that I could see. A couple called it an intelligent film. But I couldn't find any intelligence in two characters living high on the hog and constantly avoiding, skirting, maneuvering around, conniving and cajoling with people to keep from paying their bills or confronting reality. On the surface, they seemed calm, but they worried about their next move all the time. Surely, that's not an intelligent film, is it? As to the acting, I saw nothing special or exceptional.

This movie has no energy. Not in the script, the actors or the direction. There is no real drama, and certainly no comedy. The dialog between Jake and Tina was mostly meaningless and drivel.

","genre":""},{"date":"9 February 2014","score":"","review":" The four main characters of Children of a Lesser God include James Leeds, Sarah Norman, Dr. Franklin, and Sarah's mother. The main characters of the film represent competing viewpoints of how Deafness is viewed by the public.James, portrayed by actor William Hurt, is an impassioned speech teacher at the school for the Deaf. He is creative in the classroom, a visionary, and an innovator who thinks outside the box. James has had a long string of short-term jobs which suggest to me that his head-in-the- clouds idealism clashed with the more pragmatic views held by previous administrators. To me, James represents my Deaf ed cohorts and me who maybe sometimes romanticize the field of education and our students and risk falling into the trap of appearing to be paternalistic towards our students despite our best intentions. Our hearts are in the right place, but sometimes we need to have our bubbles burst and brought back to reality.Sarah Norman, portrayed by Marlee Matlin (who is Deaf in real life), is a former student of the school where she now works as a custodian, despite her intellectual gifts. To me, Sarah represents the Deaf culture at large in that they're sometimes misunderstood by the hearing world. Sarah comes across as rebellious and angry, yet in actuality, she is hurt by the humiliation and isolation she has suffered at the hands of a few ignorant hearing people.Dr. Franklin, played by Philip Bosco, is the administrator of the school. He represents the old-school mentality of a practical and realistic education for the Deaf. In his eyes, Sarah is successful in that she has a job and is paying taxes. This is not to say that Dr. Franklin is a villain. He obviously cares about his students; he just doesn't see them as equals to hearing people. To give an example of his mindset, note how he contrasts his philosophy to that of James'. Dr. Frankin talking to James I'm sure you do have a lot of energy and a lot of new ideas. I did too when...But nobody's trying to change the world around here. Just trying to help a few deaf kids get along a little better. But that's all. Everything else is razzle-dazzle. Am I making myself clear? Actress Piper Laurie plays Sarah's mother. She represents the families of Deaf children who struggle to put away their feelings of loss and disappointment after having a disabled child. Since Sarah's mother never learned to sign fluently, the miscommunication and misunderstandings between mother and child were inevitable.Four scenes come to mind when considering cultural and social dynamics of the movie Children of a Lesser God. One scene that points to the isolation sometimes felt by Deaf people in a hearing world was the dinner party where James is in the minority because the party goers are all Deaf or hearing people heavily involved in the Deaf community. Even though James is a user of sign language, his fluency is an issue and the participants are employing American Sign Language. His discomfort and feelings of exclusion are palpable. What is telling is that I don't believe James realized that the emotions he was feeling were the same feelings that kept Sarah from venturing into the world outside the school for the Deaf.Another scene that struck me was when James and Sarah were at a restaurant dancing as they communicated through sign language. There was another couple dancing nearby who couldn't keep their eyes off James and Sarah. The look on the couple's faces wasn't that of curiosity or fascination, but of morbid curiosity. It reminded me of people who rudely stare at amputees or those with physical deformities.A third scene that pointed to the cultural and social dynamics between the hearing and Deaf worlds is when James brought Sarah to a poker party hosted by his hearing colleagues. Sarah had taken it upon herself to learn the rules of poker in order to fit in. Among his friends, James got all the credit for training her. Sarah caught on at the end of the party and was understandably hurt and annoyed by being likened to a trained dog.The fourth scene that called attention to the gulf between the hearing and Deaf worlds was when Sarah asked James to explain what music sounded like. He tried, but couldn't find the signs or even the words to explain the emotional power of music to a Deaf person. James' frustration at Sarah for not being able to hear the sounds he loved and Sarah's frustration for not being able to share in James' love of music created a fissure in the burgeoning relationship of the Deaf-Hearing couple.The main theme of the movie Children of a Lesser God is that love, good intentions, or government regulations can't easily bridge the abyss separating two cultures divided by history, maltreatment, and exploitation of the minority culture by the majority. You notice I said intervention can't easily bridge the gap. All of these things &#x96; love, good intentions, government involvement &#x96; can and have improved the lives of Deaf people and other disadvantaged groups, but it has taken time. The movie is about two ordinary people trying to overcome suspicion, bitterness, misunderstanding, and cultural missteps in order to find a common ground to explore their love. As James asked Sarah Do you think there's someplace where we can meet that's not in silence and not in sound? This film remains one of my favorite movies and was the inspiration for my choice of avocation. Although some conventions that the movie uses, such as William Hurt orally interpreting Marlee Matlin's signs during private conversations, are sometimes grating, it is better than using subtitles. The movie is a good starting point for hearing individuals to develop an understanding of the complex hurdles that Deaf people must overcome.

Sarah comes across as rebellious and angry, yet in actuality, she is hurt by the humiliation and isolation she has suffered at the hands of a few ignorant hearing people.Dr. Franklin, played by Philip Bosco, is the administrator of the school. He represents the old-school mentality of a practical and realistic education for the Deaf. In his eyes, Sarah is successful in that she has a job and is paying taxes. This is not to say that Dr. Franklin is a villain. He obviously cares about his students; he just doesn't see them as equals to hearing people. To give an example of his mindset, note how he contrasts his philosophy to that of James'. Dr. Frankin talking to James I'm sure you do have a lot of energy and a lot of new ideas. I did too when...But nobody's trying to change the world around here. Just trying to help a few deaf kids get along a little better. But that's all. Everything else is razzle-dazzle. Am I making myself clear? Actress Piper Laurie plays Sarah's mother. She represents the families of Deaf children who struggle to put away their feelings of loss and disappointment after having a disabled child. Since Sarah's mother never learned to sign fluently, the miscommunication and misunderstandings between mother and child were inevitable.Four scenes come to mind when considering cultural and social dynamics of the movie Children of a Lesser God. One scene that points to the isolation sometimes felt by Deaf people in a hearing world was the dinner party where James is in the minority because the party goers are all Deaf or hearing people heavily involved in the Deaf community. Even though James is a user of sign language, his fluency is an issue and the participants are employing American Sign Language. His discomfort and feelings of exclusion are palpable. What is telling is that I don't believe James realized that the emotions he was feeling were the same feelings that kept Sarah from venturing into the world outside the school for the Deaf.Another scene that struck me was when James and Sarah were at a restaurant dancing as they communicated through sign language. There was another couple dancing nearby who couldn't keep their eyes off James and Sarah. The look on the couple's faces wasn't that of curiosity or fascination, but of morbid curiosity. It reminded me of people who rudely stare at amputees or those with physical deformities.A third scene that pointed to the cultural and social dynamics between the hearing and Deaf worlds is when James brought Sarah to a poker party hosted by his hearing colleagues. Sarah had taken it upon herself to learn the rules of poker in order to fit in. Among his friends, James got all the credit for training her. Sarah caught on at the end of the party and was understandably hurt and annoyed by being likened to a trained dog.The fourth scene that called attention to the gulf between the hearing and Deaf worlds was when Sarah asked James to explain what music sounded like. He tried, but couldn't find the signs or even the words to explain the emotional power of music to a Deaf person. James' frustration at Sarah for not being able to hear the sounds he loved and Sarah's frustration for not being able to share in James' love of music created a fissure in the burgeoning relationship of the Deaf-Hearing couple.The main theme of the movie Children of a Lesser God is that love, good intentions, or government regulations can't easily bridge the abyss separating two cultures divided by history, maltreatment, and exploitation of the minority culture by the majority. You notice I said intervention can't easily bridge the gap. All of these things &#x96; love, good intentions, government involvement &#x96; can and have improved the lives of Deaf people and other disadvantaged groups, but it has taken time. The movie is about two ordinary people trying to overcome suspicion, bitterness, misunderstanding, and cultural missteps in order to find a common ground to explore their love. As James asked Sarah Do you think there's someplace where we can meet that's not in silence and not in sound? This film remains one of my favorite movies and was the inspiration for my choice of avocation. Although some conventions that the movie uses, such as William Hurt orally interpreting Marlee Matlin's signs during private conversations, are sometimes grating, it is better than using subtitles. The movie is a good starting point for hearing individuals to develop an understanding of the complex hurdles that Deaf people must overcome.

It just didn't grab me that way. Earlier today, The Magnificent Ambersons managed to affect me in a way that Citizen Kane hasn't done after three viewings; I thought this was a masterful story told brilliantly, and that's without knowing ahead of time how the studio (RKO) butchered the original product.A particular scene that got me, cinematically speaking, was when George (Tim Holt) and Lucy (Anne Baxter) rode past Eugene Morgan (Joseph Cotten) in their horse drawn sleigh while other Amberson family members struggle to push Morgan's car through the snow. The beauty of that snow-scape seemed absolutely surreal and wonderful. Regarding Welles' use of lighting and camera angles, the scenes of George and Aunt Fanny (Agnes Moorehead) arguing up and down the staircase of their mansion was also incredibly effective. Perhaps I'm just noticing these things better now, but they seem to surpass the camera work of Welles' earlier triumph.Storywise, there's no arguing that Welles packs a lot of emotion into his decades spanning history of the Ambersons. Early on it felt as if the story was rushed to get to George's adulthood, but once there we learn that he never outgrew the tantrums of his youth. For Tim Holt to convey such an arrogant character was significant for me, as most of my viewing of Holt's work has been in rather perfunctory B Westerns. So his range as an actor, even if one sided here, was a worthy discovery for me.As regards my own age, I was rather drawn to the impact of Eugene Morgan's letter to Isabel (Dolores Costello) regarding her son George. I've had it personally confirmed repeatedly that '40 can't tell 20', and to see that concept on display in the latter half of the movie was quite impactful. It's probably the main reason that history is doomed to repeat itself with successive generations, even though we have the experience and teaching of many wise men who have gone before.

This film exposes the life of a young girl, Holly Golightly, played by Audrey Hepburn, a Manhattan socialite who is vivacious, beautiful, witty, independent, and has a passion for fashion. One would think Holly had it all. However, she does not; there is something missing. At the opening scene, the viewer sees her hopping out of a taxi cab, clearly dressed from the night before, because her back reveling gown is one that's more suited for an after five or formal event. As she sips her cup of Joe and takes a bite out of a pastry, she can't help but notice a beautiful bracelet in her favorite stores, Tiffany and Co., window so she stops for a moment to admire their displays. This is the viewer's first glimpse at her style and fashionable taste for the finer things in life. There are many directions the theme of this movie takes the viewer&#x97; dreams and the hopes of one day&#x85;, one's unwillingness and\/or fear of being tethered down, even though it leads to emptiness. However, I think the major underlining theme in this film is one of learning the true meaning of love. Holly puts up a brave front throughout this movie hoping to convenience herself and others that she can only have love for objects or things and has no real need for human affection, that is of course, unless it or he comes with a big bank account. This idea is supported by how she views her relationships with men and she did not even bother to give her cat a real name, she called him Cat. There is a gentleman, Paul Varjak, played by George Peppard, who is clearly interested in Holly, but because he is not of the class Holly is looking for in a man, she cannot be bothered. It appears the only other person she truly cares for is her brother, Fred, who is away fighting a war. As I mentioned before, this movie is very applicable to modern day films and TV shows. One that comes to mind immediately is the film and television show, Sex in the City. Holly's character is closely related to that story's character Carrie Bradshaw, played by Sarah Jessica Parker. They both chase love in all of the wrong places and have great sense of style. Was it Breakfast at Tiffany's Holly that inspired Carrie's role? One will definitely be able to see the similarities. There are a lot of enhancements that add to the making of Breakfast at Tiffany's through the use of sound, lighting and motifs. Sound and lighting is used to add drama when needed (pouring rain on a darkened day) to let the viewer know this is a serious scene or laughter and the sound of a crowd enjoying each other's company to signify this scene is Holly's enjoyment in life, to name a few. Holly's feeling of not belonging, unwillingness to be tied down and kept in a cage by anyone or anything, and her dreams and hopes of one day. It all adds up to create a picture of this young lady's adult life and her journey to fill her emptiness and need to be accepted in high society.

For those with more muscle than smarts, the world of professional boxing may offer a viable true calling, but a shot at the title is a rare privilege. Rocky is the story of a man who's given that rare privilege, and rises to the challenge to prove that he's more than just a bum off the streets.If nothing else, Rocky Balboa is one of the most iconic characters in cinema, and his training scenes are among some of the most iconic scenes in film history. The film's biggest action occurs at the beginning and end, with the dramatic and intense boxing matches; in between, the film focuses less on boxing and more on the drama surrounding the character. It is a compelling drama, filled with violent outbursts and pathological struggles that really help define the characters and make the story relevant. However, the film does lose its momentum in the middle, and the plot becomes a bit random before Rocky shapes up and finally fights Apollo Creed.Despite some drag, the film does have a compelling story. Most of the film's power resides in the main character, who is a perfectly lovable good guy with a good heart, but is constantly forced to hurt people to make ends meet; when he isn't in the ring, he uses his brawn on the street. However, much of the film is about Rocky rising out of the gutter and becoming something more than what he is; on a fundamental level, the film embodies an inspirational power and thematic depth that could apply to anybody in the world. It ultimately amounts to a full manifestation of the American dream the story of a man who defies all odds and all adversities to rise out of the lower class and fight on the same level as a heavyweight champion. It doesn't even matter if Rocky wins or loses; he proves definitively that there's more than one way to win in life.This film is as rough and gritty as they come. The photography is solid and steady, but with some very drab and grainy color schemes. Sylvester Stallone has never had much elegance in his roles, but as Rocky, he works within his limitations and takes full advantage to give his character decent depth and nuance. I always found Burt Young's character totally unlikable, but Talia Shire is cute. Carl Weathers is not bad as Apollo Creed, and Burgess Meredith is awesome. Writing is pretty good overall. This production uses some very real-looking sets, props, and costumes. The locales are especially interesting, because they look so scuzzy most of the time, it paints a pretty grim world around Rocky, which help give his struggles more weight. Bill Conti's music score is quite iconic and uplifting.The history of the film is pretty interesting as well, given that Stallone's own life mirrors Rocky's to a point. Much like the boxer he portrays, Stallone started off poor and obscure, but took a chance on a script that seemed like it'd be a long shot. That script turned into this movie; this movie turned into a franchise, and Stallone is still successful to this day.Although there are parts of this film I find a bit slow, it is a compelling story that's well worth watching. It has a depth and spirit that anybody can draw inspiration from; if you have a dream that seems impossible, you can achieve it if you exercise your talents and go the distance.Recommended! 4\/5 (Entertainment Pretty Good | Story Very Good | Film Good) ","genre":null},{"date":"9 February 2014","score":"","review":" There are those with a lot of brains and those with a lot of brawn; both paths offer their share of opportunities and temptations.

Its Martin's second zany wacky off the wall movie after 'The Jerk' which wasn't as madcap as this. In this work of genius Martin is set free to basically come up with as much lunacy as he possibly can and boy does he.The plot is somewhat sensible I guess, a brain surgeon falls for the sexy Kathleen Turner only to eventually discover she is a gold digger and doesn't give a damn about anyone really. In the mean time Martin falls in love with a disembodied brain (in a jar) and decides to try and rescue it with a new fresh sexy body.The whole idea is basically a B-movie homage to various ridiculous horror concepts and at the same time an influence for many future raunchy trashy 80's teen comedies, it serves dual purpose. Its not exactly a full spoof but it comes close at times, its just an insane comedy with surreal touches of outlandish humour that borders on spoof.Most of the funny moments tend to be sexual innuendo or sight gags, some childish some clever and witty, whilst others are clearly in there just for the hell of it, probably created on the spot. Take Martin's character name for instance...'Dr Hfuhruhurr', we here Martin say his name properly right at the start but from then on almost everybody pronounces it differently as they struggle to say it, most just give up. This is such a stupid gag ,its infantile, but it works so brilliantly every time yet you don't really know why. You know its stupid but seeing all the various characters pronounce it so randomly is just so fudging funny. The joke is even extended to a few other characters also, you'd think it would get old but it still manages to make you smile.What hit me was how old the film looked, it was released in 83 but it looks like a 70's flick to me. Everything really looks so dated nowadays but I think some of it is deliberate, made to look cheap like an old fashioned mad scientist movie. Naturally the fake castle laboratory within the apartment (nice switch) is the cheesy stereotypical mad scientist vibe for this kind of thing. I like how they include that simply for that reason and actually say that in the film hehe could almost be a Leslie Nielsen vehicle.Its also easy to forget how hot Turner was back in the day, she smoulders here as the evil temptress or black widow. I also like the various bits of ass on display too (yeah sue me). I do recall watching this as a kid and thinking it was a dirty film, to a kid the material shown is quite kinky and revealing for sure, the dialog is also pretty smutty and only now as an adult do I appreciate it, much like all the humour.This has to be Martin's best film or close to, its such a shame he never really did anymore off the wall flicks like this. There is so much that works here, so many little gags and visual nuggets that are admittedly so daft (the very quick human pinball scene) you just can't help but like it (unless you dislike Steve Martin's style of course). Its rude crazy and predictable (with a brief bit of in your face racism!) but for me its probably one of the best comedies made.'The only time we doctors should accept death is when it's caused by our own incompetence'10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 February 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Easily the best collaboration between Martin and Reiner in their long movie errm...collaborations.

Its not exactly a full spoof but it comes close at times, its just an insane comedy with surreal touches of outlandish humour that borders on spoof.Most of the funny moments tend to be sexual innuendo or sight gags, some childish some clever and witty, whilst others are clearly in there just for the hell of it, probably created on the spot. Take Martin's character name for instance...'Dr Hfuhruhurr', we here Martin say his name properly right at the start but from then on almost everybody pronounces it differently as they struggle to say it, most just give up. This is such a stupid gag ,its infantile, but it works so brilliantly every time yet you don't really know why. You know its stupid but seeing all the various characters pronounce it so randomly is just so fudging funny. The joke is even extended to a few other characters also, you'd think it would get old but it still manages to make you smile.What hit me was how old the film looked, it was released in 83 but it looks like a 70's flick to me. Everything really looks so dated nowadays but I think some of it is deliberate, made to look cheap like an old fashioned mad scientist movie. Naturally the fake castle laboratory within the apartment (nice switch) is the cheesy stereotypical mad scientist vibe for this kind of thing. I like how they include that simply for that reason and actually say that in the film hehe could almost be a Leslie Nielsen vehicle.Its also easy to forget how hot Turner was back in the day, she smoulders here as the evil temptress or black widow. I also like the various bits of ass on display too (yeah sue me). I do recall watching this as a kid and thinking it was a dirty film, to a kid the material shown is quite kinky and revealing for sure, the dialog is also pretty smutty and only now as an adult do I appreciate it, much like all the humour.This has to be Martin's best film or close to, its such a shame he never really did anymore off the wall flicks like this.

I mean, there don't seem to be many alternatives to eating SOYLENT GREEN. People might be disgusted for a few hours but then they'll realize that there is little else to eat.Maybe this might have been more interesting to watch if we didn't all know the ending. This is a movie that's been ruined by popular culture. The most famous line in this movie (Charlton Heston's revelation) was listed by AFI as the 77th best movie quote of all-time. Just about everyone who watches this today probably already knows the ending. I know I did.SOYLENT GREEN wouldn't have been bad if it had other stuff to offer than its most famous line but it seems to exist just for its most famous line. Nothing else is very good. Charlton Heston is okay but he was much better in other movies, like BEN-HUR, PLANET OF THE APES and THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. I think he was trying but the script didn't really offer much. Everyone's already pointed out that Edward G. Robinson gave a great final performance and I think he did too. I wish I could say that his performance alone saved the movie but, unfortunately, there are too many things in this movie for it to balance them out.Quite a few things don't make sense. The world isn't believable. Why aren't more people dying because of hunger or illness? How can the government support so many people? I realize the filmmakers might have been trying to point out some problems with the Soviet Union but there weren't that many people in the Soviet Union. I can understand why some people even have to sleep on the stairs in Charlton Heston's apartment but why aren't there more people on the streets (especially at night).Now I really like many cheesy sci-fi movies that don't make sense. LOGAN'S RUN is an example. I like it because it does get quite poignant at times. SOYLENT GREEN is rarely touching (the most touching scene is at the end and I won't spoil it for anyone).Some of the exposition techniques were kind of clumsy. There's a scene where Charlton Heston is talking to someone through a glass with a microphone. There is someone by him (a doctor, I think) who can hear everything that the man Heston is talking to is saying. The story could not work if the doctor(and the audience) knew what the man was telling Heston. So how did the writers solve this problem? By having the speaker through which Heston is listening to the man malfunction. The doctor gives Heston headphones to listen through. This, of course, means that only Heston knows what the other man is saying and not the doctor or the audience. I just thought this was really clumsy. Why not have the doctor not stand by Heston to begin with? Sorry if this explanation of the scene was confusing but you'll understand what I'm saying when you see it.The movie isn't even pleasant to look at. Now I know this is a dystopian movie but there are many dystopian movies that look nice. LOGAN'S RUN, which came out just 3 years later (although it did have a much higher budget, I'll admit) looks great for when it was made. BLADE RUNNER looks excellent; it's visuals hold up very well today. The biggest problem is that the story is quite sparse. Basically, this is a 30- or maybe 45-minute story in a 97-minute movie.

Sorcerer's Apprentice is a great Mickey Mouse feature that should have been made into a separate movie. That's segment's strong messages of consequences of one's actions is outstanding. The rest? The other segments are not worth talking about, because Warners Brothers Bugs Bunny and Co. did that stuff 20 times better and with a sense of humor. In ending, the uncut version presented here, with the narration, well, let me say this, the narration is not needed, it only slowed things down.

In the old movies, all the characters had some unique eccentricness which defined them. One could enjoy them even in a plot less movie like when drifting aimlessly in space. But after seeing this movie I can hardly define anyone they are all the same. Only Data with his emo-chip seemed to have something going on.Second is the plot. The plot is reasonable some guy that wants something bad. There is some philosophical message behind it, like time gives meaning to our actions. The old movies had such messages too. But the problem with this movie, and the main reason why I sack it, is because the plot is so ill-conceived. Towards the end, it actually is opposing its message. The two protagonists are fighting zealously, but even if they lose, they will be able to come again and try to thwart Soran's plans once more. So who cares whether they succeed or not this time&#x85; Not to mention the holes that time travel introduces. It is inherent to unconditioned time travel to devoid actions and choices of meaning because they can be redone. And this movie is full of such meaningless moments.And all this while the first 20 minutes were pretty well done&#x85; but in the end a disappointing Start Trek movie. 4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 February 2014","score":"","review":" This is a very bad Star Trek movie.

He might not have such a well recognised 'classic' in his resume as those guys (although Re-Animator comes close, I suppose), but it could be argued that the overall quality of his output has been consistently higher than these better-known horror luminaries (who, let's face it, have had their fair share of turkeys over the years).If you don't believe me, check out the director's dark fairytale Dolls, his twisted Lovecraft adaptations From Beyond and Dagon (and Re-Animator, of course), and the gritty shocker King of the Ants&#x97;all solid films worthy of a place in any self respecting horror fan's DVD collection. But better than any of those, in my humble opinion, is Castle Freak, a splendid Gothic horror that really does deliver the goods in practically every department it's stylish, atmospheric, sexy, emotionally charged, scary, gory, and more than a little perverse, and even features the classic combo of Jeffrey Combs and Barbara Crampton amongst its cast.Combs plays John Reilly, who along with his estranged wife Susan (Crampton) and blind daughter Rebecca (played by teen hottie Jessica Dollarhide), has travelled to Europe to take up temporary residence in the 12th century castle that they have recently inherited. As John sets about writing an inventory of the castle's contents, Rebecca explores her new home, unaware that a monstrously deformed freak lies chained up in the dungeon, and he's very, very hungry...In the hands of a less daring director, this could so have been an instantly forgettable piece of cheesy B-movie hokum, but Gordon's unique, twisted approach elevates it way above your usual direct to DVD fare, and guarantees a few eye-openers along the way. Be honest, how many horror films do you know that offer full frontal shots of their creature's mutilated genitalia? And can you name more than a couple of titles that depict a woman's nipple being bitten clean off? Or have you ever seen Jeffrey Combs bury his face deep in a hooker's crotch before giving her a quick knee-trembler? I'm guessing that you answered 'no' to at least two of those questions.
