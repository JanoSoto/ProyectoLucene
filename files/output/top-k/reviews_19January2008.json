If you answered one of the greatest franchises and concepts ever, you are correct. If not, please leave this review.The Evil Dead has touched geeks all over the world, me included. It has spawned comic books, merchandise, a groovy musical, and video games. Along with many spin-offs of it's most popular and beloved character - Ashley J. Williams. It even made the director, Sam Raimi, famous. You may also remember him from the Spider-man trilogy.The Evil Dead has also gained one of the largest cult followings in the history of dorkiness, probably only behind classics like 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' and 'Star Wars'. And that' saying something.The plot is very simple. Teens go up into a cabin, and get killed. Only difference is that in this certain movie, the main character survives, but only to get possessed, attacked again, and then thrown into the past to save an army, and eventually to save a convenient store from a demon... But perhaps that's giving a bit too much away.Now, the idea sounds very cliché, yes, but like all great horror movies, it was once original. Stephen King once called The Evil Dead 'The most ferociously original horror film of the year'. I may hate King, but at least he got it right once.The movie stars.... Yup, you guessed it, Bruce mother fu(c)king Campbell as Ashley J. Williams. This single movie turned Bruce into one of the biggest cult actors of all the time. You may also remember him from the Spider-man trilogy. Remember? The man who named and defeated the title character? Eat your heart out, Venom.So, Ashley\/Bruce brings his girlfriend Linda (typical brunette), his sister Cheryl (typical nerd), his best friend Scott (typical pervert), and his girlfriend Shelly (typical slut) up into the middle of the woods. They find an abandoned cabin, and decide to spend the weekend there. Sounds like a dream vacation, dosen't it? And let me just say, like any good horror flick, chaos followed - A lot of chaos. From the horrifying scene where Ash's sister gets raped in the woods (by a fu(c)king tree no less). To the classic scene where Ash had to butcher all his friends into little chunks (spoiler). To the nightmare inducing scene where Ash finds out that an evil force destroyed the only bridge back to civilization. Make sure to bring the whole family! Paranoia, loneliness, ever ending dread, and endless loss of familiarness and the things we love makes The Evil Dead a hard watch for the weak minded. But I'm not writing this review for you pussies, am I? Plus there's also the X-rated gore and violence that is vomit and nightmare worthy also... Which makes it not of the weak stomach either... But again, GTFO if you are.The Evil Deas remains as one of the scariest movies ever made, and a career starting success. The sequels would also get a lot more scarier, a lot more funnier, and a lot more overall awesome.This movie would also spawn the first franchise where not one of the three films shared the same main genre.

Would I have watched it years later if I never saw it before? Probably not, and DEFINITELY not for any reason other than Robin Williams' starring role. However, since I had seen it while growing up, I decided to try it again, and unsurprisingly, it turned out to be average overall.Professor Philip Brainard is an absent-minded professor with a living computer named Weebo that floats through the air as his assistant. He is in love with Dr. Sara Jean Reynolds, the president of Medfield, a college which is in financial trouble. Brainard is busy trying to create a substance that will save the college, and has failed to show up at his attempted wedding more than once. Sara gives him one more chance, and if he fails to show up this time, it will be the last straw! That night, he successfully creates a living green substance which he calls flubber (after Weebo says it's flying rubber), and it appears this substance will do the trick! Sadly, he also misses the wedding again, and Sara is fed up. Nonetheless, he thinks about how he's going to use flubber to save Medfield College, and tries to once again win the heart of Sara, who is now going out with Wilson Croft, Brainard's rival. Meanwhile, Bennett Hoenicker is a spoiled student whom Brainard has failed, and his father, the extremely wealthy Chester Hoenicker plans to persuade the professor to pass his son! Robin Williams is a very talented comedian, but that doesn't really show in this movie. He's a bit tamer than you may expect, in the kind of role you may expect one to act crazy in, and he is certainly not very funny. After saying that, I should also point out that Flubber as a whole fails as a comedy. I certainly didn't laugh, or even smile very much, and the part that I remember laughing the most at wasn't even supposed to be funny! The scene I'm talking about is the one where Sara says This is going to be the very last time I try to marry you, which reminds me, the relationship between Philip and Sara is a rather awkward part of the story, and I guess there are problems with the script. The only really good INTENTIONAL gag I can think of is the Let him have it. Give it to him. No, give it to him. Stop that and give it to him... one. Another problem I can't forget is the villains, ones which may not belong.Flubber is a remake of the 1961 Disney film, The Absent Minded Professor, which I haven't seen (I didn't even know Flubber was a remake until around the time I last saw it), but know the 1961 original is generally considered superior. Well, it is a common thing for remakes to be inferior to their predecessors (I'm certainly not saying they always are, but it's not uncommon for fans of the original to be disappointed to some degree by the remake), and I'm sure this one is no exception. Whether you've seen The Absent Minded Professor or not, and whether you like it or not if you have seen it, you have to remember that Flubber is a kids' movie, and for most adults, other than parents, it is an insignificant flick, and probably not worth it.

Would I have watched it years later if I never saw it before? Probably not, and DEFINITELY not for any reason other than Robin Williams' starring role. However, since I had seen it while growing up, I decided to try it again, and unsurprisingly, it turned out to be average overall.Professor Philip Brainard is an absent-minded professor with a living computer named Weebo that floats through the air as his assistant. He is in love with Dr. Sara Jean Reynolds, the president of Medfield, a college which is in financial trouble. Brainard is busy trying to create a substance that will save the college, and has failed to show up at his attempted wedding more than once. Sara gives him one more chance, and if he fails to show up this time, it will be the last straw! That night, he successfully creates a living green substance which he calls flubber (after Weebo says it's flying rubber), and it appears this substance will do the trick! Sadly, he also misses the wedding again, and Sara is fed up. Nonetheless, he thinks about how he's going to use flubber to save Medfield College, and tries to once again win the heart of Sara, who is now going out with Wilson Croft, Brainard's rival. Meanwhile, Bennett Hoenicker is a spoiled student whom Brainard has failed, and his father, the extremely wealthy Chester Hoenicker plans to persuade the professor to pass his son! Robin Williams is a very talented comedian, but that doesn't really show in this movie. He's a bit tamer than you may expect, in the kind of role you may expect one to act crazy in, and he is certainly not very funny. After saying that, I should also point out that Flubber as a whole fails as a comedy. I certainly didn't laugh, or even smile very much, and the part that I remember laughing the most at wasn't even supposed to be funny! The scene I'm talking about is the one where Sara says This is going to be the very last time I try to marry you, which reminds me, the relationship between Philip and Sara is a rather awkward part of the story, and I guess there are problems with the script. The only really good INTENTIONAL gag I can think of is the Let him have it. Give it to him. No, give it to him. Stop that and give it to him... one.

It is, apparently(I haven't watched very many of them... this one was given to me), one of the few Disney sequels that is actually a direct sequel, rather than the story of the kids of the main character or characters of the original film. It's a mixed bag. There aren't many songs, and one of them may even just be (some) new lyrics for one from the first... but on the other hand, both Iago and Jafar get a song(each)... the latter was supposed to have one in the first, it just didn't quite work out, and Freeman(Jonathan, not Morgan) certainly does sing well. The pacing isn't too bad, I guess. The plot certainly could have been better. Abis Mal is not that interesting of a character. The themes aren't as good and the developments just don't work as well as those of the first. The animation varies, some bits are downright poor when compared to that of the first. The energy and creativity in no way measures up to that of the first. I realize that the following is not necessarily something they could have fixed... but Castellaneta just does not make as good a Genie as Williams. Sorry, Dan... I like ya, I do(honestly possibly more than Rob), but some parts just suit certain actors better, and, let's face it, Genie is essentially Williams as an animated character. Dan tries, but it just doesn't work. In fact, it seems almost like they changed the character of Genie, either to move it away from the Williams performance or to suit the new guy, and if there was ever a character in fiction best suited for a fast-paced stand-up comedian, rather than an actor perhaps best known for his voice-work portraying one of the slowest, most dim-witted characters in the history of animation(it should be noted that I *love* The Simpsons, the first many years, until it turned sucky)... yeah, that character would have to be Genie. The film is a mere 70 minutes or so long, and only about an hour of it is actual film. There are dramatic parts, but the film is just not the adventure that the first was. It's nowhere near as entertaining... but hey, the actors do return(save for Williams), and at least Freeman does still do well(Gottfried was... not as good as he was in the first, a pity, since his character, Iago, is featured so heavily in this, especially early on... maybe that was the problem, he was overexposed). The DVD... could be better. The menus aren't as attractive as those of the DVD of Aladdin. The extras... well, there are three. One that takes you directly to any of the songs in the film(which, sadly, serves to underline just how few there are... and the DVD of Aladdin actually had other recordings of the songs featured, as well as deleted\/unused songs). One that will have Aladdin describe how people wish in different parts of the world, divided into brief clips. And lastly, a feature that will allow you three wishes granted by Jafar... that one is actually decent enough. All in all, I'm not sure there's terribly much lost from not watching this. I recommend it to fans of Disney, Aladdin, and\/or those who want to see more of Jafar... and it helps to not be terribly picky. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"19 January 2008","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Disney's first direct-to-video sequel... a rather dubious honor, surely.

First, I'm dead certain that Lorraine Gary is terribly under-rated as an actress. Second, I would bet my life that she watched 1986's Aliens while preparing for this performance. The time-line is appropriate, and there's a quality in Lorraine's character in Jaws The Revenge that very much reminds me of some of the great female screen warriors, such as Sigourney Weaver in the Alien films, and Jamie Lee Curtis in her Halloween films (I will always consider Halloween H2O Twenty Year Later to be the final installment of a trilogy, that being Halloween, Halloween II, and H2O.) Laurie Strode and Ellen Ripley are such strong, enigmatic, and iconic women, and Lorraine Gary in the Jaws films (excluding Jaws 3D, which she was not a part of) comes close to them as an interesting character whom we get to know and love and root for over a span of many years and many sequels. Gary's Ellen Brody is now wiser, more wounded, and even more beautiful than she was in 1976's Jaws. In Jaws The Revenge Ellen loses one of her sons to a shark attack. Her husband, police chief Martin Brody, has died of a heart attack, and Ellen still lives in Amity and now must mourn the passing of another family member. She's convinced that fear of the sharks from the first two films is what truly killed Martin, and now she finds herself plagued by another fatal attack. She travels to the Bahamas to visit her other son, and meets a friendly pilot (Michael Caine) along the way. Once there, she tries to get back to her old self, but instead is haunted by nightmares and fear. This leads to paranoia and an obsession with the idea that her family is predestined for more horrible shark attacks. Her surviving son, Michael, works underwater, and this terrifies her. Everyone thinks Ellen is over-reacting. When Michael does encounter a large Great White, he realizes that his mother's fears might just be justified, but he decides not to tell her about the incident. Meanwhile, Ellen senses the danger in a way that suggests a telepathic link between her and the shark that killed her son. The ocean itself seems to call her name, and at the very moment that Michael encounters the shark Ellen's intuition tells her that something awful is wrong, even though she is miles away at the time. This psychic subplot is one of the most interesting things about the film (John Boorman did the same thing with the character of Regan MacNeil, and to great effect, in Exorcist II The Heretic - I adore both of these films for trying to do something different than their predecessors) Since she can't explain to anyone what's happening to her, Ellen must bury these strange and scary feelings,and try to go on. Against her better judgment, she then begins an affair with the airplane pilot, and takes small steps towards living a normal life again. But before long, her grand-daughter survives an attack by a Great White, and this is the event that sends Ellen off to face the shark once and for all. She decides to sacrifice herself to the beast, in the hopes that this will satisfy the shark and spare what remains of her family. She takes a boat out to sea and waits for the shark to find her. Ultimately, she is rescued by the pilot and her son, and together the three of them destroy the shark by feeding it a makeshift bomb, in a nicely-done sequence borrowed heavily (and rather touchingly) from the finale of the original Jaws. Gary's characterization in this particular film is lovely. She gets to show her acting range here much more than in the first two films, and maybe more than she's ever done in a film before (sadly, it seems that she is now retired.) She gives Ellen Brody the same warmth that she always does, but here she is such a sympathetic character that you just want to give her a big hug. You can tell that by this time Gary knows who this woman is from the inside out, and she makes every scene believable. It's no surprise to me that she was nominated for a Saturn Award for her performance - and she should have won it. The moments in the film when she is psychically aware of the shark are amazing. The musical cues are perfect in these scenes, and Gary makes it seem like it's really happening. Whether it's a touching scene or one of suspense, she is mesmerizing throughout. She makes this film work very well, in my opinion. (There is a particular scene just before the finale when Ellen takes her jacket off, and it looks just like the scene in Aliens where Ripley is in the elevator, preparing to rescue Newt, and she removes her jacket in order to wear the artillery bands.) Even the shoulder pads Ellen Brody wears throughout this film suggest a warrior aspect, and with her lean body and determined expressions she seems capable of anything. She is proof that women get stronger, more beautiful, and more commanding of the screen as they age; it is tragic that Hollywood has difficulty realizing this, and giving older actresses like Gary better parts. But Jaws The Revenge realizes it, and succeeds, and by the end of it I found Ellen Brody as compelling a heroine as one could hope for. Jaws The Revenge is not just a horror film; it is also a very human story, one that incorporates emotion and mystery at every opportunity. Lorraine Gary makes it satisfying as no other actress could have done, and Ellen Brody takes her place alongside some of the genre's most notable and enduring female characters.

She decides to sacrifice herself to the beast, in the hopes that this will satisfy the shark and spare what remains of her family. She takes a boat out to sea and waits for the shark to find her. Ultimately, she is rescued by the pilot and her son, and together the three of them destroy the shark by feeding it a makeshift bomb, in a nicely-done sequence borrowed heavily (and rather touchingly) from the finale of the original Jaws. Gary's characterization in this particular film is lovely. She gets to show her acting range here much more than in the first two films, and maybe more than she's ever done in a film before (sadly, it seems that she is now retired.) She gives Ellen Brody the same warmth that she always does, but here she is such a sympathetic character that you just want to give her a big hug. You can tell that by this time Gary knows who this woman is from the inside out, and she makes every scene believable. It's no surprise to me that she was nominated for a Saturn Award for her performance - and she should have won it. The moments in the film when she is psychically aware of the shark are amazing. The musical cues are perfect in these scenes, and Gary makes it seem like it's really happening. Whether it's a touching scene or one of suspense, she is mesmerizing throughout. She makes this film work very well, in my opinion. (There is a particular scene just before the finale when Ellen takes her jacket off, and it looks just like the scene in Aliens where Ripley is in the elevator, preparing to rescue Newt, and she removes her jacket in order to wear the artillery bands.) Even the shoulder pads Ellen Brody wears throughout this film suggest a warrior aspect, and with her lean body and determined expressions she seems capable of anything. She is proof that women get stronger, more beautiful, and more commanding of the screen as they age; it is tragic that Hollywood has difficulty realizing this, and giving older actresses like Gary better parts. But Jaws The Revenge realizes it, and succeeds, and by the end of it I found Ellen Brody as compelling a heroine as one could hope for. Jaws The Revenge is not just a horror film; it is also a very human story, one that incorporates emotion and mystery at every opportunity. Lorraine Gary makes it satisfying as no other actress could have done, and Ellen Brody takes her place alongside some of the genre's most notable and enduring female characters. ","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"19 January 2008","score":"4 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" I'm convinced of two things after seeing this movie. First, I'm dead certain that Lorraine Gary is terribly under-rated as an actress. Second, I would bet my life that she watched 1986's Aliens while preparing for this performance. The time-line is appropriate, and there's a quality in Lorraine's character in Jaws The Revenge that very much reminds me of some of the great female screen warriors, such as Sigourney Weaver in the Alien films, and Jamie Lee Curtis in her Halloween films (I will always consider Halloween H2O Twenty Year Later to be the final installment of a trilogy, that being Halloween, Halloween II, and H2O.) Laurie Strode and Ellen Ripley are such strong, enigmatic, and iconic women, and Lorraine Gary in the Jaws films (excluding Jaws 3D, which she was not a part of) comes close to them as an interesting character whom we get to know and love and root for over a span of many years and many sequels. Gary's Ellen Brody is now wiser, more wounded, and even more beautiful than she was in 1976's Jaws. In Jaws The Revenge Ellen loses one of her sons to a shark attack. Her husband, police chief Martin Brody, has died of a heart attack, and Ellen still lives in Amity and now must mourn the passing of another family member. She's convinced that fear of the sharks from the first two films is what truly killed Martin, and now she finds herself plagued by another fatal attack. She travels to the Bahamas to visit her other son, and meets a friendly pilot (Michael Caine) along the way. Once there, she tries to get back to her old self, but instead is haunted by nightmares and fear. This leads to paranoia and an obsession with the idea that her family is predestined for more horrible shark attacks. Her surviving son, Michael, works underwater, and this terrifies her. Everyone thinks Ellen is over-reacting. When Michael does encounter a large Great White, he realizes that his mother's fears might just be justified, but he decides not to tell her about the incident. Meanwhile, Ellen senses the danger in a way that suggests a telepathic link between her and the shark that killed her son. The ocean itself seems to call her name, and at the very moment that Michael encounters the shark Ellen's intuition tells her that something awful is wrong, even though she is miles away at the time. This psychic subplot is one of the most interesting things about the film (John Boorman did the same thing with the character of Regan MacNeil, and to great effect, in Exorcist II The Heretic - I adore both of these films for trying to do something different than their predecessors) Since she can't explain to anyone what's happening to her, Ellen must bury these strange and scary feelings,and try to go on. Against her better judgment, she then begins an affair with the airplane pilot, and takes small steps towards living a normal life again. But before long, her grand-daughter survives an attack by a Great White, and this is the event that sends Ellen off to face the shark once and for all.

At a time when audiences were flocking to the sanitized rah-rah Americana of the Tom Cruise vehicle Top Gun, the spectacle of a snooping college student forced to strip at knife-point by a crazed, masochist lounge singer just before a spectacularly profane, gas-sniffing psychopathic sadist named Frank Booth interrupts their encounter and does sexual gymnastics involving pieces of a blue velvet rode was appealingly, or appallingly, subversive and forever changed cinema. It sent shock-waves throughout the world. People left theater screenings at the pure disgust and absurdity of it all, it provoked endless controversy...but now, its status as a classic is pinned firmly in cinema history.The film starts with an idyllic, picturesque small town. It's a town where every day has blue skies, perfectly manicured lawns, pretty flowers, and quiet simple people. It is complete with diners, apple-pie eating families, over-hanging tree-lined streets and cosy homes. Lynch fills the screen with gorgeous pictures straight out of fifties television shows. But this is a David Lynch movie and the pretty pictures don't last long. Quickly an old man who is watering his lawn falls down, near death, presumably from a heart-attack. The camera pans down past the convulsing man and deep into the grass. Digging into the earth until the camera is dark with freshly wet dirt and grotesque bugs.

This was my first Kurosawa film by now... but will definitely not be my last one! Let me first say this Instead of going into town, I decided to stay home alone and watch this movie. And now afterwards I must say It was totally worth it! The camera in this movie turns very slowly and the screens stay focus on pictures for a long time, also the movie actually lasts two hours - but altogether comes down in a flash, as so it only were 10 minutes. Do not get bothered about that this is a black\/white movie, this actually gives it the right flare and impression. This movie does not need colors, or let me put it this way the black and white colors simply fit to the storyline. Well, the storyline Classic and awesome.

This was my first Kurosawa film by now... but will definitely not be my last one! Let me first say this Instead of going into town, I decided to stay home alone and watch this movie. And now afterwards I must say It was totally worth it! The camera in this movie turns very slowly and the screens stay focus on pictures for a long time, also the movie actually lasts two hours - but altogether comes down in a flash, as so it only were 10 minutes. Do not get bothered about that this is a black\/white movie, this actually gives it the right flare and impression. This movie does not need colors, or let me put it this way the black and white colors simply fit to the storyline. Well, the storyline Classic and awesome.

I would like to report that its a great film but its not. I enjoyed it but to me the story was lacking, I wanted to know more. I also had problems with the second half of the film which seemed to be straining to go into a man made direction instead of one that flowed naturally.The first half flows. I was just going to take a peak at the film only to find that 45 minutes had passed as if in a blink of an eye. The second half of the film is less natural, it moves in fits toward a conclusion we know from the outset of the film, but which is arrived at via a journey that doesn't seem natural. (the events are fine, its the foreshadowing and thrust to the end that doesn't work.) Technically this is a beautiful film... The march across the ice under a red setting sun is now one of my favorite images..Don't get me wrong, I like the movie but I don't love it.If you get a chance to see it please do so its a wonderful film, that simply disappointed me in the second half.

Joe through out the movie has such a wonderment and exciting learner about him. The scenes with Joe and Susan were so intense that it could have been a silent movie with their mesmerizing eyes seducing each other. Anytime they were together they were like magnets so drawn to each other. Anthony Hopkins was excellent in this movie as was the rest of the cast. Each and every character was portrayed to the fullest extent of all of the actors. The scene where Joe is at the hospital is magnificent..even the accent from the islands. The movie continues to build and there are no lulls...... I have watched this movie it over and over again even to the point of knowing the dialog! I LOVE IT!!

Not that it didn't have its moments -- that particularly riveting scene, for instance, where Norma sits in DeMille's chair and a stagehand acquaintance puts a spotlight on her and people begin crowding around her, how spooky can you get? But by and large, Gloria Swanson hams up her lines to the point where she becomes a TV skit caricature (only this skit goes on way too long), Holden runs his lines off too fast, and von Stroheim mumbles all his lines indifferently (I picture him saying to himself, Here I am, the genius who directed 'Greed', and what am I doing today??). Let's face it, folks, this is the kind of claptrap that made the revolution in film-making some 20 years later so necessary, films like The French Connection and Raiders of the Lost Ark sweeping away the cobwebs of crass melodramas like Sunset Boulevard and never looking back.
