[{"date":"7 July 2006","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Ever since Magnolia was released, audiences everywhere have been divided by those who love it, and those who hate it. Some think it's pretentious and pointless, while others find it to be cinema genius. I'm someone who love's Magnolia.Magnolia is an epic mosaic set in California's San Fernando Valley. We follow the various stories of various conflicted characters, and how they will all connect by the end of the day. There's Jimmy Gator, a successful T.V. show host for the game show What Do Kids Know?, and has recently found out that he is terminally ill with cancer. His daughter, Claudia Wilson Gator, is troubled, and is falling deeper and deeper into a cocaine addiction. Then there's Earl Partridge, a terminally ill, guilt driven man who would do anything to see his son, and to be forgiven in his final hour of life. His son, Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise in his finest performance), is a charismatic sex guru, who offers silly advice to struggling men. Earl's wife, Linda Partridge, has about the same amount of guilt as her husband, claiming to slept around with other men. But, of all the years of infidelity, she is finally starting to love her husband, just as he is reaching death. Jim Curring, a modest police officer, is a struggling man who just wants to love someone, and for someone to love him back. He soon immediately falls in love with Claudia. On the T.V. show, What Do Kids Know, there's Stanley Spector, a boy who has to deal with the grueling mental pressure of being on the show, and his father's abuse. The old winner of the show, the now middle aged Quiz Kid Donnie Smith, is a struggling man who, like Jim, just wants to be loved. All of these characters and stories will soon connect by a bizarre and biblical event. In the end, Magnolia is film of raw emotion. It's about forgiveness, redemption, humanity, morality, death, loss... The film deals with things that happen every day, and things that happen rarely. The film is also beautifully crafted by writer\/director Paul Thomas Anderson, who has proved to be one of the finest filmmakers of his generation. Along with his brilliant screenplay and direction, Magnolia also features one of the best ensembles I've ever seen in any film. Magnolia gives thought provoking themes, and tons of powerful scenes, including when all of the characters sing Aimee Mann's Wise Up. We may be through with the past, but the past ain't through with us.Rating **** \/ **** ","genre":null},{"date":"7 July 2006","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Ever since Magnolia was released, audiences everywhere have been divided by those who love it, and those who hate it.

While your jaw is dropped during a Terminator movie, are you really sacred? I don't think so, because you are there to see what new CGIs have been strung together - plot matters not.So many daily situations can become terrifying for no reason at all, because there are so many people involved in daily living - like a trip to the market.....or a walk down a dimly-lighted street. Deliverance is SO frightening, because those innocent actions can turn deadly in a heart-beat. Venturing into the backwoods is a frolic in fun? Anyone who has that notion does not read the papers, watch the daily news, nor has not seen some of the other movies that depict the seriousness of trespassing into territories where outsiders are not welcome. It is almost unbelievable that the advance dish on Deliverance didn't inform almost everyone going to view it this was no picnic, and squeal like a pig wasn't a part of Deulling Banjos.I hate the term hillbillies, because - as some users wrote - that demeans entire regions of people who are very content to live as they know how - without the interference of modern life. Much is made of inbred - that is not sexuality peculiar to the backwoods. Chinatown should teach us that lesson. However, city-slickers are extremely dumb to enter a closed society and give them attitude. I know lots of hillbillies - they are moral people, when left to themselves. Their justice can be brutal when they feel threatened or humiliated, just like the justice in city streets. They don't need any part of the city - the city should take its canoe-ing and camping to legal sites.Deliverance was the last film I found Jon Voight to do any real acting - I hope I'm wrong. He was extremely underpaid for Midnight Cowboy, because he was unknown, but demonstrated that he could do that role at the drop of a hat. His acting in Deliverance was superb. It gave us a clear demonstration ordinary people can move mountains, if it's necessary - but who wants to be thought-of as ordinary today? His stifled sob at the dinner was brilliant. Wow! for Burt Reynolds !!! One must ask what led him into those other tacky films? His manliness, although misguided, in this film set the pace for the endurance necessary to make it out of the wilderness - not only in the backwoods, but the wilderness of everyday-life. Ned Beatty was stellar - his underwear may not have had Versace stitched on it, but his shell-shocked performance was perfect. As noted, he became stronger than any of the group by the end of the movie. Ronny Cox played the moral guy to the hilt - every man should have his determination to do what is right. Several users have theorized he was shot, or lost his balance when he pitched-into the river - my theory is that he was so disgusted with the whole journey, he committed suicide. No gunshot was heard during the scene and Voight and Beatty did not find a wound.James Dicey certainly knows how to weave a suspenseful tale, and was great as the sheriff - it is said he was so terrified of acting he came to the set drunk every day. His character could see the three canoe-rs were guilty of surviving, but also knew they didn't stand a chance against a jury of the local people, no matter how kindly they were treated in Aintry. He was also aware that the meaner of the locals could be cruel. Justice ? - don't come back up here again. Not many users knew hillbillies were used in the film where ever it was possible - what actors could portray them better? The mountain-men WERE actually mountain-men.......Every detail of this movie was perfect - no doubt it was dangerous to play in. Play in? Better fight-for-your-life in. I've experienced some near-dangerous incidents, and am content to live outside of the fray - you guys who feel your manhood raging can have my part.That we have absolutely killed - and continue to do so - irreplaceable areas of this country in undeniable. To be able to view its grandeur on any media is enthralling, but it leaves a bitter taste to realize some do not care about it. Los Angeles, where I live, is a perfect example it's built-up right into the territories for wild animals, and steadfastly believes humans come before animals. Those are their rightful habitats - we should leave them be just that. Any wonder why coyotes and bears and wolves wander into neighborhoods? They're theirs.In some less threatening way, we all need to experience the lessons to be learned from Deliverance - to understand our advancement technologically does not lead to supremacy. I thank all those city-slickers who went out into the wilderness to produce this modern classic, so that it can scare the heck out of me when I watch it. You can have the thrill of danger - I'll stick to the TV. 30-out-of-10.

It does fairly well as a monster movie except for the god awful choice of Maria Pitillo as the lead actress. She makes dumb blonds seem like Einstein. There are plenty of really smart blonds out there but Pitillo is just plain embarrassing. The computer graphics are outstanding. I would have rather seen someone like Peter Weller as Dr. Tatopoulos. Why they kept making a joke out of his name is beyond me and the total disrespect shown him is uncalled for. This man is a scientist of some esteem.

I first saw this film when i was about 9 or 10 and was blown away by it since at the time i was only familiar with the Adam West Batman show of the 60's which i happened to love at the time, being a long time Batman comic book fan as well, i was able to overlook some of the changes that were made, in fact some of the changes were for the better, like the Joker for example.Before this film came out, the Joker was mostly known as a harmless criminal with really bad jokes(romero portrayal), but in this film he is a take no prisoners maniac with a dark and sinister sense of humor. I also really liked the new origin they gave Joker, being a hit-man for the mob sort of brings a darker side to him, no one else could have been the Joker besides Jack Nicholson himself(i'm actually a little skeptical about the fact that the next batman film will have the joker in it since only Nicholson could capture the Joker perfectly). And of course lets not forget to mention Batman\/Bruce Wayne, Michael Keaton really almost convinces you that he IS Batman\/Bruce Wayne, he portrays him as very tormented and mysterious and i believe he was the first to do that signature low raspy voice while dressed as Batman(something that unfortunately Christian bale wasn't able to do as well). There is just something about Michael Keatons appearance that just looks like he was pulled right out of the comics.The entire film is action packed, from the classic first appearance of Batman as he opens up his cape and scares off some low life thugs who had just mugged an out of town family, he grabs one of the thugs who begs for his life and when asks what are you?!, he simply respsonds ....I'm Batman! all the way to the finale (and i love the fact that it was done in a cathedral!) where Batman is fighting off the Jokers goons until the Joker ultimately reaches his classic death(and the film really makes you almost want to cheer after this scene). Sometihng that i HAVE to mention though is that the murder of Bruce Waynes parents has been done 3 times in all 5 Batman films, and this movie did it best BY FAR. While Batman Begins and Batman Forever didn't do bad jobs at portraying this scene, it came off a little stale, but you have to remember this is supposed to be a traumatizing scene, it should be almost HORRIFYING, which is exactly what this film did. Tim Burton really brought a eerie atmosphere to this scene but doing it in slow motion, adding lots of fog and of course a heavy echo, what really stands out is the scene where you see the murderer standing in the shadows, you cant really see his face but then he walks out of the mist and says with a sinister smile tell me kid... have you ever danced with the devil by the pale moon light? Tim Burtonreally brought an almost futuristic look to Batman, the all blackarmored bat suit, and batmobile armed with weapons which could really hold its own in a war and the slightly silly shield. The music inthis film is just perfect, it really captures the mood and fits perfectly for the tone, sometimes it can sound very noirish and other times very Gothic sounding. My favorite musical piece is when Batman puts on the Batsuit for the last time and the Batmobile drives through the axis chemicals place just blowing up everything in its way.So if you have only seen Batman Begins or have just seen any Batman film in particular, you should really check out this film, its a real classic. I wrote this review because i saw that there have been many fans who really got hooked on Batman Begins but have not seen the older Batman films, this movie really moved me the first time i saw it and now more than 10 years later it is still possibly my all time favorite film.

This is film isn't meant to be taken too seriously and is in turn one of the funnest films ever made. Up to this day, The Blob remains one of the greatest cult classics of it's era.The legendary monster is a mass of jello that comes from outer space on a meteorite.

The hero of the film, Steve, and his girlfriend are the only ones who seem to be worried about the monster and attempt to warn the ignorant townsfolk of the beast. They ignore his warnings until it is too late and the Blob has grown to massive proportions.Is it a masterpiece like Citizen Kane? No, but that's because it isn't meant to be such. It's supposed to be a goofy drive-in flick, and it succeeds admirably as entertainment. Several aspects show this to be a smarter flick than it may appear on the surface. Some folks don't seem to be able to understand the sense of humor that wasn't prevalent in most films from the era. The goofy theme song by Burt Bacharach and the references to other films show this was ahead of its time. In addition to the humor, it can be quite chilling occasionally. The scene at the beginning of the death of the old man, even though tame by today's standards, is quite graphic for the time.What ultimately makes the film work for me are the likable characters.

Also, the teenagers aren't presented as delinquents or idiots which is often the case with films like this.

Others believe that his greatest achievement lies within the confines of Taxi Driver. And then there are other fans, who fall into another camp, one that will always remember the genius that he exuded on another film. That film is Raging Bull, his most poignant and beautiful, yet unrelenting, film.Paul Schrader's superlative script gives us insight into the life of Jake La Motta, played by Robert De Niro. De Niro puts forth bestial nature of the boxer so brilliantly and puts forth so much effort to become him; he even gained sixty pounds for the later scenes! To only praise De Niro would be a crime, though. Joe Pesci holds his own against the titanic De Niro and provides an antagonistic camaraderie toward him. Cathy Moriarty, who plays La Motta's wife Vickie, is perfect and acts as a voice of reason against La Motta's paranoid delusions.Raging Bull is violent and vicious, yet somehow there is a great beauty attached to it. The black and white cinematography is amazing, with its long takes and shots. The boxing matches are the best ever filmed, making the sport seem akin to ballet. The animal sounds thrown in to some of the fights reminds us of the brutality of the sport, and of La Motta. But some of the beauty would not be achieved without the music from Pietro Mascagni's opera Cavalleria Rusticana. This extends Bull to operatic heights.I love Goodfellas, even though it is a little overrated; I like Taxi Driver, even though it is overrated too. However, Raging Bull exceeds all expectations and becomes Scrosese's best film. Bull is the best film of 1980, the best film of the 80s, and probably the best film of all time.

Everybody knows that the world of Bond is the ultimate hero fantasy the good guy will thwart the villain and get the beautiful girl at the end. We know what he'll do before the movie starts; we just don't know how he'll do it.In his third outing as 007, Roger Moore finally hits his stride. In his first two Bond films, the production team treated him as just a replacement for Sean Connery. Here, Moore is finally accepted on his own terms.

It is certainly the best of the Moore Bonds, and arguably a highlight of the series.THE SPY WHO LOVED ME has all of the classic Bond elements beautiful girls, fancy gadgets, international intrigue, exotic locales and a megalomaniac villain armed with infinite manpower and resources.

Using a high-tech tracking system, he has hijacked British and Russian nuclear subs. Bond must join forces with an elegant Soviet spy, Agent XXX (Barbara Bach) to thwart Stromberg's plan for global domination. Like all great Bond villains, Stromberg has an army of paid assassins armed with an impressive array of weapons.

Shot by Woody one shot van Dyke in just twelve days with many of the first takes used in the film, it still comes across as wonderfully fresh. The story revolves around William Powell as detective Nick Charles, who tries to crack the case of a missing scientist, together with his wife Nora (Myrna Loy). But forget about this whodunit aspect of the film, it's not that important. It's just adding to the fun. It's all about the marvellous interaction between Powell and Loy, simply the most wonderful screen pairing ever. Their constant courtship is a marvel to look at and watching the wonderful chemistry burning of the screen leaves me in a pleasant happy daze, slightly intoxicating.They must be one of the very few boozy characters in the history of cinema, that seem to be drunk all the time and be continuously happy at the same time. On a continuous drinking frenzy, they're either perpetually pixillated or fighting the hang-over. Never marry someone who doesn't join you when drinking. Nora certainly does. When they meet up in a restaurant Nora asks 'Say, how many drinks have you had?'. 'Uhmm, this will make six Martini's.' 'Alright, waiter, will you bring me five more Martini's.

Only a handful come to my mind, and it's a very small handful at that.Sergio Leone's classic western provides the perfect ensemble of cinematography, direction, acting, story, and last, but not least, music. Leone's film about three greedy men in the search for 500,000 in gold exemplifies the dirty west. This is not your typical American western, where the sun-drenched west is romanticized. No, it's dirty and rough, just like the west was. If anyone wanted to watch the film that is the antithesis the chick-flick, I would recommend The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.Clint Eastwood reprises his iconic Man With No Name in this final film in the Dollars Trilogy. Lee Van Cleef returns from A Few Dollars More; however, he plays a different (much different) character. The actor who steals the show has to be Eli Wallach. Wallach, a western veteran, plays Tuco with great viciousness and humor, making him likable and unlikeable at the same time; he truly is ugly. Leone and his cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli pack the film with great shots of the west, from the tired sands of the desert, to the endless graves of a cemetery (which was actually located in Spain). Ennio Morricone combines Colli's lush cinematography with the greatest score ever put onto film. From the easily recognizable theme, to the sad Story of a Soldier, to the excitement of Ecstacy of Gold, this soundtrack has it all.What more can I say? If you haven't seen The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, see it now! I can not press you more. This is one of those films that could be considered perfect, or the closest to perfection.

(The name Landon itself seems more fit for The OC.) The love story between the Jamie and Landon is clearly forced. Whether it is due to bad writing or bad acting, we never really care about the characters. Also, A Walk to Remember offers countless cringe-inducing lines. This is a typical case of the dialogue working better on the page than on the screen as spoken by an actor. Everything in this movie is cliché. (From the slang to the overly-used high fives.)

The films finale is anticlimactic and the resolution is unsatisfactory.Aside from that, it's hard to tell what audience the writer is trying to target.

Then they are lured off the main road and take a deserted track that leads them to Leatherface and his cannibalistic family. Now the pairs' only chance of escaping this demented nightmare rests on a well-prepared survivalist, who they had a car accident with and which has left them at Leatherface's mercy.Well, that just seemed to breeze by with very little impact, but I found Leatherface The Texas Chainsaw Massacre to be rather nasty piece of work that's an exceptionally well-made production. Sure, it's not very explicit because of the MPAA cuts leaving a lot of the real gruel up in the air and causing large continuity shifts in the story. But these factors didn't stop me from mildly enjoying this torturous outing that seems to skip the events that followed on in Hooper's outrageously jokey sequel The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2.It kind of starts off like the original film by providing a voice over dude giving their own interpretation of what had happened after the first flick and there are scenarios that have that rehash feeling about them. Replacing the goofiness of the last feature is a more serious approach that has some dark macabre wit within the script and some crazy antics. There's even a new gimmick involving Leatherface's glistening new chainsaw! Which is the most frightening item you can ever think of, although it would have been great it he got to use it on someone! The problem with the flick was that it looks too clean and really lacks that iron-fisted and repellently grimy nature, because it never gets truly dirty and that ending is totally out-of-place. Again it might look polished, but there is still a ruthlessly unflinching edge about its shocks, but the thing is they are just far from disturbing and lose that subtle realism. Despite all that it efficiently creates an isolated feeling amongst the sticks, the photography is well displayed and an atmospherically Gothic score amplifies a tight knit awe to proceedings. Although it probably could have done without those instrumental, heavy metal cues.The short story is draped with many activities (some rather vague) and characters that come from nowhere and disappear and then reappear. It might be basic, senseless and foreseeable material, but really there was only one thing that got to me and they were the unexplained details and one or two illogical moments. Like Leatherface's new clan and that of Ken Foree's character. The performances were ho-hum, but it's the fun supporting roles by Viggo Mortensen as the subtle one minute to nut-job the next and legendary horror figure Ken Foree as the likable survivalist make it even more enjoyable. Kate Hodge is okay in the lead role as one of Leatherface's prey and R.A.Mihailoff steps up to the plate as Leatherface and does fair job at it and brings back some of that fear associated with that icon. Although anyone accustomed to the original knows no one gets near Gunnar Hansen performance! It's certainly not a great film and does lack the heart of the earlier efforts, but still I didn't mind it and it goes by quick enough if caught in the right mindset.
