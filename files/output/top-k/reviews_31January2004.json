The Blair Witch Project was a low-budget, post film school movie that made it 'big time'.This film is seen as extremely overrated by many,but by others(i.e me) it is seen as a breather in modern film-making and an extremely original film.The whole concept of setting out the movie as if it were all real and an actual documentary made by the three film students in question was unique and,if i am correct,is still the only of its kind upto this day. This movie is scary and chilling.The sounds you hear as a child,like the russling of leaves in the woods behind your garden,are brought to the surface again because of what this film represents. If I ever go camping(last time being 2 years ago)I always listen to the sounds of movement in the trees and bushes,not because I expect to see anything,but because your mind is always conscious of any possible danger and this movie capitalises fully on this whole aspect of the human mind working in this way.This makes The Blair Witch Project one of the scariest films I've ever seen. Because of the use of hand-held video recorders,either black & white or colour(both working perfectly to create their own respected affect)the feel of reality in the film is emphasized and your involvement is enhanced which to me gives a fuller and more enjoyable cinematic experience. This film does have downfalls in some places,for example the film can be repetitive in places.This maybe because of the repeated surroundings and not much of an expansion of plots from start to finish but my concentration on the film was never lost. The acting isn't of great talent,the better of the three being Heather Donahue,who,unsurprisingly is cast as the main character.But what is too be expected of three new stars acting in their first major movie. This movie appealed to me on realise and I eventually got to view it two years later on,and it surpassed every expectations I had of it.One of the truly great horror movies,it shall live on that way for years to come.

Lenny (Ralph Fiennes) is a peddler in Virtual Reality memories - snippets of people's lives that you can plug into your brain.  The movie starts out innocently enough -as Lenny shows different ways this technology can be used (eg become a woman, participate in armed hold ups, relive personal memories).  When things start turning sour (right before the new millennium) - Lenny's world comes crashing down all around him.  He begins to suspect that his ex-girlfriend will be the latest victim of a psychopathic killer - who is using the VR technology in sickening ways. Strange Days was co-written by James Cameron - thus it has a sci-fi, thriller feel to it.  I feel that Strange Days is a significant film of it's time - it captures the mood, feelings and angst at that time.  Also - it deals with the millennium bogeyman feeling that some had around the 90s. Strange Days is excellently directed by Kathryn Bigelow (a then ex-wife of Cameron) - there is a visual edge - the VR scenes are highlights. This movie is just so seat-squirmingly good - the VR scenes are graphic and are sometimes hard to take in.  You get an uncomfortable feeling that you are watching something which has already taken place in the past - you can't go and change it. This movie is both exciting, thrilling but I think its shock value makes it memorable in the long run.  I think this is a totally underrated flick - some might be put off by the inaccurate depiction of 1999 - but hey - this is sci-fi (emphasis on the fiction).

I could sum it up by saying that it's about a depressed, lonely man living in the absolute dregs of society who is forced, by some awful set of events, to raise the most hideously deformed child ever created while he's on vacation.  I could also add that he fantasizes about a world that exists behind his radiator, where a woman with oversized cheeks steps on worm-like creatures and sings songs about everything being fine in heaven.  And I couldn't forget to mention the strange planet inhabited by a scarred man behind a set of levers that appear to control....See?  What's the point.  Summing up the plot of Eraserhead is a ridiculous thing to do because it's not about its plot.  It's about the finer details of the film.  Without a doubt the most striking feature of this movie is its sound design, which adds greatly to the overall tone of the film.  The sound design that makes the whole experience feel eerie and somewhat wrong, that makes you feel trapped in Henry's world.  The next time you watch this movie, notice that there isn't one frame of the film without some sort of everpresent ambient noise, be it the sound of steam going through pipes in Henry's apartment or a litter of puppies suckling on its mother at the X house.  The only silence in the film comes at the end, after Henry embraces the woman behind the radiator.And the high-contrast black and white photography.  I thought it was a bit pretentious of David Lynch to include instructions on how to adjust your TV to make the film look better, but he's right.  It shows the painstaking detail he adhered to for the photography of his greatest film.  The shot of his neighbor walking out of the darkness and into the light before she asks to spend the night at his place is utterly breathtaking when viewed in this way.And that's what makes me so happy about the cleaned-up DVD release of this film.  I always had to watch third-generation copies of someone's bootleg Japanese VHS copy with Japanese subtitles.

I could also add that he fantasizes about a world that exists behind his radiator, where a woman with oversized cheeks steps on worm-like creatures and sings songs about everything being fine in heaven.  And I couldn't forget to mention the strange planet inhabited by a scarred man behind a set of levers that appear to control....See?  What's the point.  Summing up the plot of Eraserhead is a ridiculous thing to do because it's not about its plot.  It's about the finer details of the film.  Without a doubt the most striking feature of this movie is its sound design, which adds greatly to the overall tone of the film.  The sound design that makes the whole experience feel eerie and somewhat wrong, that makes you feel trapped in Henry's world.  The next time you watch this movie, notice that there isn't one frame of the film without some sort of everpresent ambient noise, be it the sound of steam going through pipes in Henry's apartment or a litter of puppies suckling on its mother at the X house.  The only silence in the film comes at the end, after Henry embraces the woman behind the radiator.And the high-contrast black and white photography.  I thought it was a bit pretentious of David Lynch to include instructions on how to adjust your TV to make the film look better, but he's right.  It shows the painstaking detail he adhered to for the photography of his greatest film.  The shot of his neighbor walking out of the darkness and into the light before she asks to spend the night at his place is utterly breathtaking when viewed in this way.And that's what makes me so happy about the cleaned-up DVD release of this film.  I always had to watch third-generation copies of someone's bootleg Japanese VHS copy with Japanese subtitles.  This version really showed me how amazing this film could really look and sound.Everyone should see this film.  Not everyone's gonna get it the first time. I don't think I did.

Despite realising the hazardous nature of the order, Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) reluctantly agrees to lead the charge. As expected the attack goes badly and many French troops lose their lives which results in a large number of men refusing to leave their trenches. General Mireau sees this from his safe position and, refusing to admit that the attack was suicide from the outset, blames the cowardice of those who refused to fight for the devastating outcome of the battle. As a result Mireau demands that three soldiers from the regiment be held accountable and face an immediate court martial followed by death by firing squad. Dax seeks for the French military hierarchy to admit the truth.This dramatic condemnation of the politics-over-people attitude of military forces during World War I is an all too accurate portrayal of how the conflict resulted in one of the largest and most pointless losses of life in all known history. Taking place in the trenches amidst the height of the futile conflict between France and Germany, director Stanley Kubrick (in only his second feature film) seeks to press home a fiercely anti-war statement backed up by actual historical facts rather than the typical embellishment that can be found in more modern war films. While the story itself is somewhat fanciful, the portrayal of the morally corrupt military leaders that sent hundreds of thousands of men to their deaths for no more reason than to satisfy their own expanded egos and enhance their perfidious reputations is, unfortunately, all too accurate and a powerful indictment of not just the French army, but all those who participated in one of the most bloody conflicts in human history. What makes the film so stinging in its approach is the flat out lies told by protagonist Mireau, who claims that one man's life is worth more to him than a reputation, yet when presented with the opportunity for political acclaim and honours is all too willing to send troops to battle when freely admitting that four thousand will probably perish in no man's land. A quick glance through history proves such on-screen bald faced lies to be inherently and tragically true off-screen, even in relation to Britain's very own Field Marshall Hague. The French government found the representation of their military too close to fact and banned &#145;Paths of Glory', eventually lifting the ban in 1970.The film does not stand out in mere message alone. For those familiar with Kubrick's later work such as &#145;2001 A Space Odyssey' (1968), &#145;A Clockwork Orange' (1971) and &#145;Full Metal Jacket' (1987) the director's soon-to-be trademarks can easily be spotted. As with many Kubrick films there is a remarkable ability to portray to the viewer what is not seen on the screen. The full carnage of the war is displayed in a darkly amusing, yet chilling scene where one soldier questions another on whether he is scared of death or merely getting hurt. As this precedes the actual battle scenes by a matter of minutes the viewer becomes rapidly acquainted with the carnage, fear and suffering these men faced despite a distinct lack of on-screen bloodshed. One could argue that the short, virtually bloodless battle scene in &#145;Paths of Glory' is even more powerful than the bloody, disturbing and prolonged beach scenes from &#145;Saving Private Ryan' (1998). Kubrick wonderfully crafts this movie around the composition of the filming rather than relying on any sort of special effects or visual trickery. Throughout the movie, particularly during the battle scenes, the viewer is given a third person perspective of the struggles of men to come to terms with life and death under such harsh conditions. Incredible acting performances from Kirk Douglas, George MacReady and Adolphe Menjou attract the viewer's attention and become the central focus in a war film with scarce amounts of action. Kubrick condemns the politics of war through the use of the politics that control war.It is very difficult to write about this film and fully do it justice. The pre-Vietnam anti-war sentiment is easily the main focus of the movie and it is through competent acting that the movie is made great. It becomes somewhat irrelevant that the movie is set in WWI as the same message applies to every major war, particularly the following decades Vietnam War. It wasn't until Oliver Stone's &#145;Platoon' (1986) that viewers were again treated to an historically based condemnation of war that focused less on heroes and more on the way things really were in battle. Wisely, the movie opens with a narrated epilogue which informs the viewer of the absurdity of WWI and then ends with a melodramatic and almost tear-inspiring scene which, although not in place when compared to the sombre and melancholy feel of the previous eighty minutes, ends the film in such a way that the film itself must be contemplated. &#145;Paths of Glory' is easily one of the most powerful films of all time and a pejorative anti-war statement where the only real failing is the short length of the movie and occasional poor performances from the supporting cast.

A famous billionaire concocts a scheme to fool SETI with a message to which he later conveniently provides the - key. The doubt is left that a recording of an outer space trip, in the blink of an eye, though nothing was recorded but static. This isn't explored and seems to be tossed away by the filmmaker in favor of his irony of science made into religion - as a matter of faith.The means to explore the irony and emptiness is, again, preposterous. A rich billionaire somehow manages to fool ground based observers that a unique message is being sent from a far away star system, travelling from earth 26 years, and sent back at higher amps almost immediately.

A more interesting film, a sequel, would follow up the hoax to see if after finding each other, that they found something true and worth believing, as well.

No doubt the view was not precisely _the_ one so well known from TV coverage but it looked eerily similar and given the circumstances of the movie...The plot is easy enough to follow A group of terrorists hijack 10 nuclear warheads from a SS10 ICBM. They arrange a collision between the transporting train and one packed with civilians, and detonate one warhead to cover the theft. Enter Dr Julia Kelly (Kidman) and Col. Tom Devoe (Clooney). Kelly is a spunky US presidential advisor - attractive, smart and courageous - but one who has never seen combat or watched someone die. Devoe is a battle-hardened veteran, not particularly a chauvenist but one who has little time for formality or niceties if it means terrorists escape with nuclear bombs to hostile countries. There is inevitable conflict between Kelly and Devoe.In relatively short order, 8 of the remaining 9 warheads are recovered, but only after the loss of a chopperful of soldiers. While Devoe is in the thick of it, Kelly only sees much of the action via spy-satellite. However she is appalled at the loss of life when the chopper is downed and requests a list of its occupants' names, weeping when she receives the list.The remaining warhead, or at least a crucial part of it powerful enough to destroy many city blocks with a small nuclear blast, is being couriered by Dusan Gavrich (Marcel Iures) to the UN. An unlikely terrorist, Gavrich is a professor who teaches children the sensitivities of classical piano-playing in his spare time. He and his associates (mostly family) have deep and personal reasons for their deadly intent however.The UN is not destroyed, largely thanks to Kelly's pluck and courage. Faced with vaporisation within a minute, and urged on by Devoe, she disarms the bomb with a knife!.Before I get drowned out by guffaws and belly-laughs, and in case you didn't know Nuclear bombs work by making plutonium or uranium-235 go critical in a way that a calculated amount of energy is released _before_ the bomb destroys itself. The bomb at hand is of the compression type, looking much like a miniature soccerball, a plutonium core surrounded by high explosive. The latter must implode the core in an extremely precise manner to achieve the desired nuclear explosion, hence disrupting that implosion by removing one of the imploding panels, as Kelly did with the knife, should prevent the device going nuclear (though not of course the conventional explosion). These days when many cannot distinguish technological fantasy from fiction, I wonder how many twigged to the significance of what was happening there?Judging from the IMDb business and box office data, this movie barely scraped even despite being intelligently and competently done by Mimi Leder (Deep Impact).
