I usually see films based on books in this way, but this time, I wish I had read the book first. There are letters in the book that should have appeared in the movie to flesh it out a bit more. Even so, it is one of the most affecting movies I have ever seen. It starts with a middle aged woman in a plane flying to London (Anne Bancroft). When she gets to the place she has been seeking, it is an abandoned storefront. She looks around wistfully as the first letter is read in her voice in the background. Magically, the film transports us back to the late 40's in New York, and to the correspondence between a woman living there and the man who is the manager of a bookshop at the title address in London (Sir Anthony Hopkins). The letters are read with great warmth and style, and the opening up in the film is well done and appropriate to the story. As the years advance, we are caught up in both of these people's lives and their correspondence. Due to events that look contrived in the movie (but make more sense in the book), Helene Hanff leads a life of the lower middle class and much as she would like to, there is no chance for her to afford the trip to London. So London is brought to her in both the great books she buys from the bookshop and by reading about the lives of Frand Doel and his family, and the other people who work at the bookstore. One of the most affecting scenes deals with the letters she receives from the other employees thanking her for the food parcels she sends to the employees for holidays. I look something like Bill Humphries, the cataloger, and his scene with his Great Aunt brought me to tears. As the years pass, there are some changes but the relationships endure. Many people have called this a love story, but the movie gives more evidence of this than the book ever does. I don't believe in that angle. Frank Doel was just part of Helene's feelings of London, and not a romance on her or his part. My only real criticism has to do with the end of the film. The book does not lead you to the same ending, and it is very helpful to read the sequel to 84 Charing Cross Road, called The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street. She did not call a few days after Frank died to find the cost of a trip to London to go there. If they had filmed it from the book it would have been just as compelling. She decided to publish the letters as Frank had died, and the reprint of the book by Reader's Digest and the fact that a London publisher decided to publish the book over a year later gave her the impetus and the finances to go to London. Having said all that, it is a great film, with amazing performances all around. This is just about the only time I have ever said, the book is better. If fact, I would encourage people to read all of Helene Hanff's works. She was an astonishing writer, and someone I wish I could have known.

Sidney Lumet's 1957 film 12 Angry Men fits this definition to a tee in that I have seen this movie literally dozens of times over the last twenty years of my life and yet, when I watched it again last night, I found myself in the same state of tension and awe as I did the first time I saw the film.The story is simple; 12 men are thrown together because they sit on the jury for a trial that involves an 18 year old boy from the slums of New York who is accused of murdering his father, who had beaten him all of his life. The boy pleads not guilty, but because of two eyewitnesses, the jury convenes to the deliberation room strongly convinced of his guilt; except for one man, played by Henry Fonda. At first, he is ridiculed for his stance, until he slowly is able to convince some of the others that perhaps there are some aspects of the case that cast some doubt on the certainty with which they all began. Because, like most juries, there are many differences in background, social standing, etc. among them, tensions rise to a crescendo many times throughout the film, causing some of them to look introspectively at themselves and each other in order to truly deliberate the fate of this young man.The brilliance of 12 Angry Men can be explained in three parts. First time director Sidney Lumet, at the time a television director, simply does everything right in this film. The setting is simple; most of the action takes place in the jury room, with the exception of some establishing shots telling the viewer where they are, and the plot is pretty straightforward. It is something that happens daily, multiple times, all across the United States. But there are some wonderful elements that he introduces into the scene to further the claustrophobia and tension He makes it the hottest day of the summer, and for most of the film, the fan doesn't work, so you can literally see the sweat pouring off of these men and soaking through their shirts. He also uses some tight close-ups of the actors at times, particularly when they are giving dissenting opinions or are in a state of emotional discomfort.Secondly, the film's script is absolutely first-rate. Not only does the story come together like a thousand (very small) puzzle pieces, but also the clever way it does this never fails to astonish me. One would think that sitting and watching 12 guys talk about a court case while getting in each other's faces for an hour and a half wouldn't be compelling, but the intricacies of each juror, the way each of their backgrounds and prejudices are revealed is fantastic. There is nothing corny in the script, no placating moments where someone just suddenly sees the light &#150; every time one of the jurors changes his vote, it is because there have been solid questions, answers, etc. have been revealed. In other words, no one gets from point A to point B without sufficient effort.Finally, 12 Angry Men features what is probably one of the greatest casts ever assembled. Henry Fonda, who usually plays a pretty good guy (with a few exceptions) plays a quiet hero in this film. He doesn't preach, he just simply is the only man in the beginning to say I don't know. His obvious relief nearly every time another juror is swayed is conveyed with a simple look that clearly shows admiration for said juror. The antithesis of Fonda's character is Lee J. Cobb's juror. He is a loud, crass man who refuses to even consider that the defendant may be innocent, even when he is faced with facts and being in the position of the minority. I merely single those two out because they are probably the most central, but every single actor in the film did a brilliant job, and really managed to give their roles depth and character, something that is not easy when you're sharing screen time with 11 other great actors.There is really absolutely nothing bad to say about the film 12 Angry Men, a film that has been praised by critics and the public alike. It holds a very high place on the IMDb Top 250 list (I believe it was #20 the last time I looked), which is extremely encouraging to me.

Which is actually not really a bad thing because the most brilliant comedies can be enjoyed without having to laugh (the first time I watched Peter Seller's Being There I was blown away, but I didn't laugh at any of the jokes).Gosford Park is an upstairs\/downstairs murder mystery set in an English manor house.

This is the kind of true story that appeals to so many people that there is absolutely no-one who would dare NOT to make movie out of it. So there were two options, either it would be filmed with a rather big budget, getting a chance in the cinema's, either it would end up as a cheap TV-drama. The makers chose the first option and that's a good thing...Erin Brockovich is an unemployed single mother. She's desperate to find a new job, but every interview ends up in disappointment because she doesn't have the right qualifications. And to make things worse for her, she also loses a lawsuit against a rich doctor who hit her in a car accident. She has no alternative left but to go to her lawyer and to 'ask' him for a job (threatening is a better word for it). She gets a job and while no-one takes her seriously, because of her trashy clothes and her lack of manners, she begins to investigate a suspicious real estate case involving the Pacific Gas & Electric Company. Soon she discovers that the company is trying quietly to buy contaminated and polluted land in a residential area. But as she digs deeper, she finds enough evidence so the law company can sue the million-dollar corporation.Normally I would say that the underdog is a likable figure and most of the time that is true, but not in this case. A woman that swears as much as the Erin Brockovich in this movie and who doesn't mind to be so aggressive to so many people, really isn't very lovable. At least not in my opinion. OK, she may have had a hard time, but that still isn't a good reason to act the way she does. (I really hope the real one isn't like that, because you can't buy style and class and this is really about as low as you can get).About the acting I can be rather brief. Julia Robert's performance was decent, but certainly wasn't good enough to win an Oscar with it. Sure, it's the perfect role to seduce the Academy with, but all she really did was showing a lot of cleavage and talking dirty (which sometimes was really funny, but not always). All the other actors and especially Albert Finney, as the lawyer and head of the company, were OK. I don't really have any remarks on their performances. They weren't spectacular, but did what they had to do.All in all this isn't a bad movie, but it certainly isn't worth all the awards that it received.

It is well-done how he and the Gungans speak, but his moves and 'humourous' character somehow does not fit in the movie, despite this one is supposed to be the 'most peaceful' of all the previous SW movies. It is also one minor flaw that the characters have apparent fluke. If I were to detail it, I would have to add spoilers, which I don't desire.

Go to the positive part this time In the movie, the long forgotten Sith return and the Sith Apprentice confront Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. For those who still have not yet seen the film Qui-Gon Jinn is the master of Obi-wan, who is still an apprentice. The Sith Lord vs. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan fight scene is probably the culmination of the events and this part is done the best. We will also see the Jedi in 'normal' combat against droids, which show how Jedi can fight. The plot is based around a conflict on a peaceful planet named Naboo, which the Trade Federation blockaded for various reasons. By the will of the Force, the two Jedi get stranded down on Tatooine, where they discover Anakin Skywalker, who actually helps them escape the planet. We will see a long 'pod race' scene on Tatooine, which could be amazing or damn boring, depending on your attitude to speed. I liked this part of the film the first time I saw it, but I normally skip this when I am to watch the film over again on VHS. When the final attack starts to retake the planet, the events are divided into three parts We can see all three emerge victorious at various costs.

It just doesn't fit. The film's writers and producers obviously couldn't make their minds up about what direction they were going to take this in. Family comedy, Pryor vehicle or kick ass suburban nightmare send-off? In they end they tried to attach all three and not surprisingly the result is a poorly paced and confused affair lacking coherence and overall good direction.'The Burbs' was intelligent because it kind of put you in a safe and familiar environment then turned it on it's head. It also had some really well developed characters. But there is little at best of that here. Randy Quaid's character is supposed to be the neighbour from hell. At least that is what we're told and what is instigated through Pryor's reaction to him. But we don't actually see much evidence of this. Which kind of made me not really understand why Pryor hated him so much. Shame as well because this is the kind of role that big Randy usually kicks ass in ie. - 'National Lampoons Vacations I,II and IV' and 'Next Door'. The removals guys were just really predictable (with the King Kong Bundy joke not really working nowadays) and though he usually makes me laugh the Dana Carvey section just wasn't well.......funny.The side stories about Pryor's daughter staying behind in Jersey because of her new boyfriend also just falls apart. He doesn't answer a call from her the night after her folks leave so from that we are meant to infer I think that he is cheating or something so she just ups sticks and moves out after her folks. Okay. But what the hell does this contribute to the story? Similarly Pryor's two twin sons decide to pass themselves off as one person throughout the movie. Ah the old identical twin joke. So their parents never went to a parent's night obviously as they claim that nobody ,outside the family home, has ever clocked onto it in their 12 years of existence. And this plot device is used for? Well nothing. Just another inconsequential little side story with no resolution.

It also had some really well developed characters. But there is little at best of that here. Randy Quaid's character is supposed to be the neighbour from hell. At least that is what we're told and what is instigated through Pryor's reaction to him. But we don't actually see much evidence of this. Which kind of made me not really understand why Pryor hated him so much. Shame as well because this is the kind of role that big Randy usually kicks ass in ie. - 'National Lampoons Vacations I,II and IV' and 'Next Door'. The removals guys were just really predictable (with the King Kong Bundy joke not really working nowadays) and though he usually makes me laugh the Dana Carvey section just wasn't well.......funny.The side stories about Pryor's daughter staying behind in Jersey because of her new boyfriend also just falls apart. He doesn't answer a call from her the night after her folks leave so from that we are meant to infer I think that he is cheating or something so she just ups sticks and moves out after her folks. Okay. But what the hell does this contribute to the story? Similarly Pryor's two twin sons decide to pass themselves off as one person throughout the movie. Ah the old identical twin joke. So their parents never went to a parent's night obviously as they claim that nobody ,outside the family home, has ever clocked onto it in their 12 years of existence.

I do not recall the Japanese ever shooting at innocent people in the movie, considering the Nurses had military ranks, and that's what the Japanese were there for. The Doolittle Raid was not an attack on civilians. It was an attack on the military structures such as war industries, shipbuilding facilities, and power plants. In fact, Doolittle strongly reiterated that no hospitals, schools, or other civilian targets, were allowed, and got very angry when hearing that some of his men wanted to hit the Imperial Palace. Therefore, the movie portrayed those American bombers as heroes because they WERE heroes, according to the current president. So maybe the movie is not 100% accurate, but what movie is, unless it's a documentary? MOST of the movie IS historically accurate. I also do not see how one can say it was insulting to the Japanese. The movie crew was nervous on how Japan would take the movie, but they obviously liked it, considering Japan was the first or second country, where the movie made the most money. The movie was NOT disrespectful to the world war veterans, they loved the movie, got to advise in the way some of the scenes went, spent time with the cast and crew of the movie, and even cried at the real feel of it.Overall, I think oatwich needs to learn to speak for himself, instead of taking it upon himself to speak for all of Pearl City and Honolulu.Usually (even with movies that I like), I am sitting there, looking at the DVD player to see how much time is left until the movie ends, because I want to get up and do something. With this movie, I was looking to see how much time was left, because I could not WAIT to see how the movie ended! I think this is an awesome, well balanced love story and action movie (almost exactly half and half), if you are able to sit in one place for almost 3 hours, and like action and romance, I would definitely recommend this movie. ) Also, if you watch this on DVD, when you put the second disk in, make sure you don't look at the chapters, or you'll ruin the ending.

By reading some comments and plot outlines, I got the impression that this was simply another celebrity guy who projected an aura of eccentricity just to raise his publicity level (like quite many stars do).However, I have to admit that watching Man of the Moon was definitely a shock. Portrayed fantastically by Jim Carrey (which gives an Oscar-worthy performance, here), this is a story of a talented man that brings you strong and contradictory emotions At one point he can make you laugh, at another he can (intentionally) bore you to death; at one point he can make you berserk with his vulgar and rude jokes, at another you can become deeply touched by his strength and willingness to live and entertain his audience despite his grave illness. Andy Kaufman was truly a special man, who did not conform to any norms or rules of society, but whose sole purpose in life was to produce laughter with his own twisted way Even if the product of his acts was not laughter but boredom, anger, or insult, he still was happy with himself as he thought he was doing the right thing.The film is neither trying to make a hero out of Kaufman, nor a villain out of him; it depicts him in an objective way, leaving the viewer to decide for himself about what kind of man Kaufman really was. As I noted previously, Carrey does a stunning act as Kaufman; an example that shows how he wanted to identify with his role, is that during the filming he insisted to be called Andy Kaufman both on and off stage! (I read this in the IMDb trivia).The rest of the crew are also superb, and the fact that some actors come from Kaufman's real-life circle brings an air of greater authenticity. Forman's direction is also up to the task.Either you already know about Kaufman, or not (like me), I strongly suggest you see this movie. 8\/10.

To give it credit COPYCAT is fairly well acted by the two female leads but is a rather dark and violent movie throughout and becomes rather sadistic by the end ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"23 May 2005","score":"3 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" Don't ask me how but I was under the impression that this was going to be a chick flick , a sort of THELMA & LOUISE with police cars and a few light hearted moments but within a few minutes my world was shattered with some graphic on screen violence . Yeah okay I also knew that this was a thriller involving a serial killer so gawd knows where I got the idea that it might be somewhat tongue in cheek but I wasn't expecting so much violence .

I thought 'Hey another movie no work I can just write notes.' After the first 5 minutes my eyes were glued to the TV. The story line was extraordinary and every actor or actress was cast perfectly in their roles. No wooden acting in this adaptation. I could go on and on about the acting and I will starting with Liam Neeson. This was the first movie except for Star Wars I have seen him in. So my expectations were lower. But after seeing this movie I was certainly proved wrong. He shows his character's transition through the movie quite perfectly. Then there is Geffory Rush as a perfect hate filled villain. Every move calculated to perfection.Next Uma Thurman, I already was a HUGE fan of hers so I had high hopes for her. In the end I wanted her part to be even bigger but that wouldn't have fitten in. Then there was Clare Danes A wonderful rising talent and a natural for Corzette. But thats enough from me you go see the movie!
