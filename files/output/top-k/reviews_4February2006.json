We were looking through my old VHS's and suddenly found Disney's old classic The Great Mouse Detective. I was at first stunned to see it. When I was a little kid in the early 90s I would watch this film religiously. I would get scared, thrilled, and excited. I had almost forgotten about even owning it. I was surprised to see my friends had watched it in their lifetimes too, since I always thought of it as a very underrated Disney gem. So we decided to pop it in and bring the old times back, since we haven't seen it in years.The Great Mouse Detective is not like other Disney films. I think this is why I loved it so much as a kid. The Great Mouse Detective is a more DARKER Disney animation. It is extremely sophisticated in its own way and doesn't rely on special PIXAR effects to make action come to life.Let me just say the plot is something like you've never seen before.Near the beginning of The Great Mouse Detective, the camera moves through London, passing many of the familiar landmarks, before finally tilting down and moving in toward a little doorway near the ground. Inside there's a busy little mouse, a craftsman, hard at work.Before long, however, a mysterious figure appears who disrupts this image of comfortable domesticity. And then The Great Mouse Detective launches its story, which depends on the conceit that London in those days housed not only a great human detective (Sherlock Holmes) but also a mouse who was every bit as good a detective.Every character is characterized. Each one has it's own rich and colorful and dark personality. The settings are amazing, how mice are living a human life just like the humans in London. One thing the creators really payed attention to was the detailing. Almost everything is detailed. Professor Ratigan's voice is perfectly done to the character.One thing as an adult, you'll realize the interaction between Basil and the young adorable girl, Olivia Flaversham. Basil is not fond of children at all during the film, but grows in love with the girl by the end. The charisma between characters is magnificent.The whole film reminds me of the old Disney classics. But this one is just so much darker and smarter. You might not even know your watching a Disney flick. Sure kids might not understand what the hell is going on...like some of the words Basil uses is so incredibly intelligent that even watching it at the age of 17 I didn't know what he was saying. Some parts are also very creepy. Like the whole toy store part used to scare me as a kid.To a toy store spectacle, to fun little musicals here and there, to a finale on top of London's Big Ben. In my opinion, the final fight on top of London's Big Ben is one of Disney's greatest scenes ever. Now watching it recently, my only problems is that some of the scenes could have been longer. I know its supposed to be fast paced but some scenes could have been longer, especially the memorable genius scene on top of Big Ben. Also, some of the characters voicings is bad, like their lips will move but they're not talking. It's not incredibly noticeable but maybe the newer DVD'S are remastered to make it all the more better. The evil Professor Ratigan is more lovable than any Disney villain yet! Watch this underrated Disney classic soon!

Seriously, folks, that's not at all a bad thing. Firstly, I must say that I am a died in the wool Reitman fan, and from that perspective, this review may be considered biased. Reitman's nearly incomparable ability to craft sweetly funny, heart touching, tongue in cheek films is at the core of this movie, as well.The premise Dave Kovic (Kevin Kline), proprietor of an temporary employment agency and part time Presidential impersonator, is spotted and recruited by the Secret Service to do a brief body double appearance for current President William Harrison Mitchell at a Washington networking dinner. Although explained to Dave as doubling for the President in exposed situations, in reality he is the scandal stopping alibi for Mitchell, currently Lewinski-ing his secretary Randi (a very small part for the tremendously talented Laura Linney). Simple enough, until the unthinkable happens Mitchell, while in flagrante delicto, suffers a massive stroke and becomes completely incapacitated.With a little ingenuity, this may have been covered up and smoothed over simply by transferring leadership to the Vice President, as specified by law. However, White House Chief of Staff Bob Alexander (Frank Langella) has other ideas entirely. Seizing on the opportunity to obtain his greatest ambition, the Presidential office for himself, Alexander decides to take matters into his own hands. Enlisting the reluctant aid of Press Secretary Alan Reed (Kevin Dunn), together they convince Dave that, for the good of the country and the world at large, he must continue to double for the President until Mitchell recovers from his slight circulatory problem of the head. Suddenly, this very down to earth guy finds himself in the most unreal of circumstances, thought of by all but a handful of insiders to BE the actual President of the United States.Although smoothly sailing at the start, as time passes, things begin to become complicated. Dave's naturally sweet personality, gentle sense of fun and moral character are by no means similar to Mitchell's, and cannot help but surface. Soon, the watchdogs of Washington, and the American public, begin to notice the difference. So does the First Lady. Estranged from her husband although living under the same roof, the more time she spends with Dave, the more keenly aware she is of the change in her husband. She begins to have her suspicions that all is not as it seems. And Dave, becoming more immersed and comfortable in his new role, decides to stretch his wings and take a shot at actually DOING the President's job for real, much to the growing consternation of Bob Alexander.Now Could this happen in real life? Probably not. With all of the security, surveillance and snooping that certainly goes on every day in Washington, could the two Pit vipers, Alexander and Reed, really pull this off? Oh, hell, no. Would a woman not know her husband even if she confronted him naked in the shower? As as woman, I doubt it. We ALWAYS know. But, to paraphrase the moderator of The Mclaughlin Report, the correct answer is Who cares? This film was never meant to be Murder at 1600 or The Shadow Conspiracy. No, think of it more as Air Bud Goes to Washington. A delightful departure from reality. A delicious What if...? story. Reitman films are NEVER believable. That is precisely what makes them so wonderful. Yes, this movie asks you to suspend belief for about two hours. Yes, it asks you to swallow the idea that Dave could fool not only the First Lady, but his cabinet, Congress, and the country at large. In fact, it seems he has convinced everyone except Oliver, a delicious cameo appearance by Oliver Stone on Larry King's show.My best advice on Dave Just watch it and love it for what it is. Forget the plot accuracies and the believability factor. Watch the actors, who are superb. Part of what makes Reitman films so watchable is the interaction between the players, the subtle sub plots and undercurrents to the story. Sigorney Weaver is excellent as First Lady Ellen Mitchell. Kevin Dunn does a marvelous job with the conflicted Alan Reed, bound by past misdeeds and present schemes to Bob Alexander yet finding a growing respect and affection for Dave. Ving Rhames is perfectly cast as Duane Stevenson, the President's personal Secret Service man. Stoic and unyieldingly correct, he also finds himself becoming attached to Kline's easily lovable Dave, as does legendary actor Ben Kingsley in his role as Vice President Nance.Kevin Kline, as usual, turns in a workmanlike performance, making Everyman Dave Kovic someone you'd love to have for your own friend. More, he makes you wish a guy like him would actually BE elected President. And what do you say about Frank Langella? He's always magnetic. Those deeply penetrating eyes with their deadly glare, that softly evil voice. Listen carefully to his dialog. Spoken softly, it doesn't do for you to miss his delivery of some of the best lines in the film. His facial expressions say more than ten pages of script could ever. Speaking of facial expressions, watch Charles Grodin as Murray Blum, Dave's accountant friend, especially in the closing scenes of the movie. Hilarious without saying a word.In case you haven't gathered, I loved this movie. I've watched it countless times, and highly recommend it as a charming, witty and touching break from the reality of politics and life in general. Buy this film. You'll be glad you did.

What makes the film so exceptional is contrary to the films reputation there is the minimal amount of actual on screen gore or cheesy dramatic horror music. Instead the film barrages you with raw psychological fear. The lack of over the top music leaves you with the terrified screams of the main characters as they confront their antagonists, as does the grainy looking film which makes it appear to be more of a home-movie gone wrong than a film at all.The appearance of Leatherface for the first time, for example is handled as casually as the appearance of any other lead character, but then of course we know the result of his appearance and cannot help but be shocked by what follows within the space of about 20 seconds afterwards.Make no mistake this film is a test in psychological strength and questions us what we would do in the situations as poor Marilyn Burns.While the film may look dated in this age of extreme gore and jump scares their is no denying the craft that has gone into this.

For-the-most-part, the movie delivers as being entertaining, but any fans wanting more than a passing movie might be disappointed.The story of this movie of course revolves around Harry Potter, his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy. In this movie Harry just turns eleven and suddenly discovers he's a wizard, and probably the most famous one at that. More details are revealed in the movie about Harry's past but I won't spoil them for those who have yet to experience the books or movies of Potter.As far as being a loyal translation, Columbus does an excellent job. Yes, plenty from the book is left out of the movie but all the vital moments are in the movie. The moments that did make it to the movie are very loyal to the book, almost too loyal. While I give Columbus credit to making the movie loyal it's just too confined, not just for the young actors in the movie but the impact on the audience as well. It's this that makes Sorcerer's Stone no more than a worthy and passing effort by Columbus.The young actors that play as Harry, Ron and Hermione are all perfect picks by Columbus, which is definitely a plus. Radcliffe as Potter is a great selection as is Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley. But Emma Watson proves as the most creditable selection and as the most mature of the young trio. Surprisingly, the actors and actresses that play the professors do a better job than our three young heroes. Not only are the selections for the professors perfect, but they add a great flair to their roles that make them seem even better for their role.The presentation of Sorcerer's Stone is magical, no doubt, a great movie for the holidays, but it just isn't enough. The movie is fairly long, at over two hours and for some it will seem as if the film drags on too much. While the translation of the teachers, students and plot of the book is done very nicely it's how everything else is executed where the movie falls apart too. Yes, the final tasks near the end of the movie and the Quidditch match are fun to watch but far from stunning.The result in Sorcerer's Stone is that it's a good movie through and through, but people, especially fans of the books like myself will feel let down by the movie. Now, this isn't a bad movie, there's lots to love in the film's magical flair from the introduction of the students, teachers and other cast members that make appearances in later films. But, if you're expecting a movie that will dazzle you then you're asking for too much of the movie.

The first two-thirds of the movie is certainly great but after that the movie takes some negative turns and it loses some of its credibility and I lost some of my interested.No question in my mind that Martin Scorsese is a great director but he however does push it at times with this movie. People compare this movie to Goodfellas for a good reason. Just like The King of Comedy and Bringing Out the Dead were similar in many ways to Taxi Driver, Casino is on many ways similar to Goodfellas. It's a tough gangster epic with lots of graphic violence, lot's of cursing and backstabbing characters. The main storyline is especially parallel to Goodfellas. Yes, you can truly describe this movie as Goodfellas set in a Las Vegas casino in the '80's. Unfortunately the casino world is not as interesting to follow as the gangster world as portrayed in Goodfellas, at least that's my opinion of it. The movie is too often about 'nothing' really. Style over substance you may say.But also when you judge the movie on its own good you have to come to the conclusion that there are flaws in it. Sharon Stone is great in this movie but her character is distracting from the movie at times, especially towards the ending when almost the entire movie evolves around her character. It gets tiresome at times after a while and the movie loses some of its credibility because of that. There also are way too many characters introduced in the movie, which makes it hard to follow at times. I also never really got in to the character, not even the main characters. I couldn't really care for any of them and it was hard to understand and follow them at time. The movie is also too violent and graphic, even for my taste. It's a bit too much and some scene's are unbearable. Scorsese really pushed it there and should had hold back a little.There's nothing wrong with the style of the movie. It's fast paced and wonderfully looking, also mainly thanks to the director of photography Robert Richardson but also of course to Martin Scorsese's stylish and unique way of directing and storytelling. Yes, there are some memorable sequences present in this movie, which certainly helps to make this movie a better one than most of the others in the same genre.Also of course the presence of some well known good actors make this movie a good one to watch. Robert De Niro is never disappointing in the main lead and Joe Pesci yet again plays a typically hot tempered Joe Pesci role in which he always is just great to watch. The movie unfortunately under-uses James Woods. They could had done some more and better things with that wonderful actor.Great to watch for the fans of the gangster genre.

I admit, when I first rented Fight Club about two years ago, I was pretty disappointed. But the reason I probably was is because it was a very different film that I had seen from others. Friends had recommended it to me saying that I would either love or hate it, but I found myself stuck in the middle. Considering that it had a high rating on the IMDb's Top 250 movies, and all of the hype that was surrounding it, I knew that I had to see it. One of the things that I didn't care for in Fight Club the first time I saw it was that I missed most of the satire and black-comedy behind the violence. However, the whole movie did have an interesting yet strange feel to it. About a year ago, I re-watched the film to see if I would find anything different about it. While watching it, I liked it much more than I did the second time. I caught more of the black humor, and it was hypnotically entertaining. The story begins with an executive (Edward Norton, playing a character without a name 'Narrator') whose bored with his life and can't sleep during the nights. He begins going to testicular cancer groups so it would make him feel better, but he can't sleep while a lady who fakes her cancer (Helena Bonham Carter playing Marla Singer) remains at the group. After his condo explodes, he is taken in by a mysterious soap salesman (Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden) who shows him a bizarre form of therapy which they call the Fight Club. 'Fight Club' isn't an easy movie to talk about, write about or forget about. It works in such brilliant ways that other films don't, and in the end the movie works on almost every level. In the sense of storytelling, it definitely succeeds. It was probably the most talked about movie of 1999, and there was much to say about it. One could say that 'Fight Club' is laughably over-the-top, or to say that the film itself doesn't make sense. I began to think that until it all caught up with me in the end. I will not give any spoilers why it did, but I wasn't really expecting a surprise. It could be compared to the bizarre style of films like Stanley Kubrick's 'Clockwork Orange', Oliver Stone's 'Natural Born Killers' and Terry Gilliam's 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'. But there's so much chemistry and psychological attitude put to this movie that you may not be able to get it the first time around. It's a social satire that has almost everything I'd look for in one. I can't really say that I thought this was directed David Fincher's best film (I enjoyed Se7en (1995) more), but this definitely makes a case as his most visual and daring film. He gives a great direction once again, gives the whole movie a very vivid feel. One of the only bad things that I can actually say about this film is some of the very strong violence (one scene in particular involving Norton and Jared Leto's character fighting) and a lot of people might think that it would lead to a pointless ending and the average viewer would be left with a negative message. But that isn't the way that it's supposed to end. You really do have to think beyond the movie, no matter how much it doesn't seem real. Since I loved Edward Norton's performance in 'American History X', he once again gives a great performance and background narration. Brad Pitt gives possibly his best performance to date, and the supporting roles are also good. The violence is probably the most controversial part of the movie. While I didn't find it too extreme, I thought that others who hadn't seen it should be aware of it. I found a lot of Fight Club quite amusing and funny, but it does get more effective toward the end. The anti-socialism in the film isn't told in a mean-spirited or hated way, the people fighting each other to released energy and power out on one another. But after its all over, you begin to realize how scary the film really is, and apocalyptic it would be in real-life. But the film is still humorous and isn't meant to be as serious as it is. I never read the book with the same title by Chuck Palahnuik, but after seeing the movie I am interested in reading it. Definitely one of the best films of 1999 along with 'American Beauty' and 'Magnolia'. To sum it all up, 'Fight Club' is one of the best viewing experiences I've ever had in my life, and one of the rare films that kept me entertained on several repeated viewings. It's a riveting, dazzling and completely original story that didn't leave my mind for a while. 4.5 out of 5 stars.

I admit, when I first rented Fight Club about two years ago, I was pretty disappointed. But the reason I probably was is because it was a very different film that I had seen from others. Friends had recommended it to me saying that I would either love or hate it, but I found myself stuck in the middle. Considering that it had a high rating on the IMDb's Top 250 movies, and all of the hype that was surrounding it, I knew that I had to see it. One of the things that I didn't care for in Fight Club the first time I saw it was that I missed most of the satire and black-comedy behind the violence. However, the whole movie did have an interesting yet strange feel to it. About a year ago, I re-watched the film to see if I would find anything different about it. While watching it, I liked it much more than I did the second time. I caught more of the black humor, and it was hypnotically entertaining. The story begins with an executive (Edward Norton, playing a character without a name 'Narrator') whose bored with his life and can't sleep during the nights. He begins going to testicular cancer groups so it would make him feel better, but he can't sleep while a lady who fakes her cancer (Helena Bonham Carter playing Marla Singer) remains at the group. After his condo explodes, he is taken in by a mysterious soap salesman (Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden) who shows him a bizarre form of therapy which they call the Fight Club. 'Fight Club' isn't an easy movie to talk about, write about or forget about. It works in such brilliant ways that other films don't, and in the end the movie works on almost every level. In the sense of storytelling, it definitely succeeds. It was probably the most talked about movie of 1999, and there was much to say about it. One could say that 'Fight Club' is laughably over-the-top, or to say that the film itself doesn't make sense. I began to think that until it all caught up with me in the end. I will not give any spoilers why it did, but I wasn't really expecting a surprise. It could be compared to the bizarre style of films like Stanley Kubrick's 'Clockwork Orange', Oliver Stone's 'Natural Born Killers' and Terry Gilliam's 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'. But there's so much chemistry and psychological attitude put to this movie that you may not be able to get it the first time around. It's a social satire that has almost everything I'd look for in one. I can't really say that I thought this was directed David Fincher's best film (I enjoyed Se7en (1995) more), but this definitely makes a case as his most visual and daring film. He gives a great direction once again, gives the whole movie a very vivid feel. One of the only bad things that I can actually say about this film is some of the very strong violence (one scene in particular involving Norton and Jared Leto's character fighting) and a lot of people might think that it would lead to a pointless ending and the average viewer would be left with a negative message. But that isn't the way that it's supposed to end. You really do have to think beyond the movie, no matter how much it doesn't seem real. Since I loved Edward Norton's performance in 'American History X', he once again gives a great performance and background narration. Brad Pitt gives possibly his best performance to date, and the supporting roles are also good. The violence is probably the most controversial part of the movie. While I didn't find it too extreme, I thought that others who hadn't seen it should be aware of it. I found a lot of Fight Club quite amusing and funny, but it does get more effective toward the end.

I found this several times in Scorsese's 'Raging Bull', where the main character is so despicable where you just have to feel sorry for the guy. Pacino well acts his character, but at times he plays him so villainously (and this may be the film's only flaw) that it gets a bit too over-the-top and his character becomes overblown.Brian De Palma (The Untouchables, Casualties of War) is a good director, but sometimes his angles confuse me. This is probably his best-directed movie though, along with Carlito's Way. The Untouchables was by far the most enjoyable of them all, but here he creates tension inside the characters, mainly Tony, to where the suspense rises within them. It's a pretty smart move.

I finally got my chance with Double Indemnity, which helped establish the genre as we know it. The expected elements are all here Shadow-filled black-and-white cinematography. An ordinary man (Walter Neff, played by Fred MacMurray) who becomes an amoral criminal under the influence of a femme fatale (Phyllis Dietrichson, played by Barbara Stanwyck). Abundant cynicism, pessimism, and fatalism. Tough, stylized dialogue, including voice-over narration with a kind of hard-edged poetry to it.However, because in the 21st century we see film noir parodies more frequently than the real thing, we've been conditioned to laugh at some of the excesses of the genre--especially this sort of narration. Thus, lines like How could I know that murder could sometimes smell like honeysuckle? or I got to thinking about what cemeteries are for--they're for putting dead people in! strike us as much funnier than they were probably intended to be. Instead of helping create a dark, gritty atmosphere, they actually jolt us out of the movie by prompting our scoffing laughter.In short, Double Indemnity does a great job of establishing the rules of the world in which the story takes place, but we now have trouble accepting that world on its own terms. And I do believe that this movie was intended to have some humor to it--but of the grimly ironic kind, not the isn't this a little ridiculous? humor we find in it today.Still, there is much to admire about Double Indemnity. It has a very strong plot--simply but elegantly constructed, and even though its general outlines get revealed within the first five minutes, the movie always remains interesting. The relationship between Walter and Phyllis is intriguingly ambiguous--it's not clear whether they are motivated by lust, greed, or something else entirely. (Roger Ebert's Great Movies essay has some noteworthy theories about this, and made me realize that this ambiguity is an asset, not a flaw.) Most impressive and unexpected is the character of insurance-claims investigator Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson). Though Keyes functions like a detective, his role doesn't indulge in any film-noir detective clichés. Instead, he's the most real-seeming person in the movie rumpled, gruff, blustering, detail-obsessed, highly conscientious, and very funny. And gradually, the film reveals that the relationship between Walter and Keyes is even more complex and interesting than that between Walter and Phyllis.Double Indemnity will always be watched because of its role in establishing the conventions of film noir, but more importantly, it's still an entertaining movie--even if, sixty years later, it's sometimes entertaining for reasons the filmmakers never intended.

Abundant cynicism, pessimism, and fatalism. Tough, stylized dialogue, including voice-over narration with a kind of hard-edged poetry to it.However, because in the 21st century we see film noir parodies more frequently than the real thing, we've been conditioned to laugh at some of the excesses of the genre--especially this sort of narration. Thus, lines like How could I know that murder could sometimes smell like honeysuckle? or I got to thinking about what cemeteries are for--they're for putting dead people in! strike us as much funnier than they were probably intended to be. Instead of helping create a dark, gritty atmosphere, they actually jolt us out of the movie by prompting our scoffing laughter.In short, Double Indemnity does a great job of establishing the rules of the world in which the story takes place, but we now have trouble accepting that world on its own terms. And I do believe that this movie was intended to have some humor to it--but of the grimly ironic kind, not the isn't this a little ridiculous? humor we find in it today.Still, there is much to admire about Double Indemnity. It has a very strong plot--simply but elegantly constructed, and even though its general outlines get revealed within the first five minutes, the movie always remains interesting. The relationship between Walter and Phyllis is intriguingly ambiguous--it's not clear whether they are motivated by lust, greed, or something else entirely. (Roger Ebert's Great Movies essay has some noteworthy theories about this, and made me realize that this ambiguity is an asset, not a flaw.) Most impressive and unexpected is the character of insurance-claims investigator Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson). Though Keyes functions like a detective, his role doesn't indulge in any film-noir detective clichés. Instead, he's the most real-seeming person in the movie rumpled, gruff, blustering, detail-obsessed, highly conscientious, and very funny. And gradually, the film reveals that the relationship between Walter and Keyes is even more complex and interesting than that between Walter and Phyllis.Double Indemnity will always be watched because of its role in establishing the conventions of film noir, but more importantly, it's still an entertaining movie--even if, sixty years later, it's sometimes entertaining for reasons the filmmakers never intended.

It's always interesting to compare different takes on the same theme, in particular because it helps reveal what lies in each interpretation and what is innate to the underlying story. In the case of this particular version, one can see clearly how it is derived via the intermediate medium of a play of the novel the film is full of two-handed dialogues, which Frears often captures by framing just two heads in close-up, one usually a little behind the other. Yet the film is not at all static (a common problem with movies based on plays) indeed, it whirls along, racing towards its conclusion with barely a scene that does not play some role in advancing the plot.My point of comparison is Roger Kumble's 'Cruel Intentions', a version of the story set in an American high school and actually a movie I detest. That film is full of the worst vulgarisms of the Hollywood teen-flick, and also makes some bad calls in how it chooses to represent parts of the story; but there are also problems that lie in the story itself. To summarise it, two people play sexual games with the lives of others, with the lead male (an apparently irresistibly attractive character) loving and leaving a host of women principally for the pleasure of breaking their hearts and ruining their reputations, sometimes at the behest of his female partner. But when he falls in love with one of his victims, he and his partner fall out. His partner betrays him to one of his cuckolds, who duly kills him. But the record he has kept of her activities come out, and her reputation is thereby finally destroyed.The problem with this is that first half of both films invite us to cynically enjoy the devious duo as they manipulate others; but their second halves require us to sympathise only with the male lead, redeemed (but also destroyed) by love, and to cheer his posthumous revenge. I have nothing against cynical films, or love stories, but I find it hard to accept stories that try to have their cake and eat it the female lead is to be enjoyed as long as the male lead is her partner in crime, but detested once he falls in love and our sympathies supposedly shift. In Kumble's film, this shift (in the male lead's character, and the audience's expected affiliation) happened far too quickly to take me with it; in Frears film, the effect is more subtle, the philanderer only truly repents his misdeeds on his death-bed, and the more hesitant nature of his transformation was ultimately more successful in moving me. Also, in Kumble's film, the avenging cuckold was angry with the male lead, but the character actually died accidentally while being attacked (yet the female lead was still held to blame, which made no sense). In Frears' story, she has clearly set up the dual in which he is slain. But in both films, the ending seems odd the hero dies, but at least the reputation of the villainess is destroyed... it seems like insufficient compensation (although in Kumble's film, this was compounded by the final shot which seemed to suggest that everything was alright because the hero's beloved at least inherited his Jaguar!).The story could be seen as sexist, for judging its female lead more harshly than its male one. Yet both films contain the same interesting line, in which the female lead confesses that she became the person she is precisely because there are so few opportunities for women to wield power and influence by honest and open means. Incapable of love, the character is surely at least in part a victim of the circumstances that have turned her into a monster. Yet both stories shy away from considering the consequences of this, in favour of indulging the dreamy love of the hero and the beauty he falls for, which sits awkwardly with the initial cynicism and asserts a highly conservative moral often present in Shakespeare's works that the worst people are those who refuse to accept their alloted place. Which is very odd, considering that the book was written as an attack on aristocracy.So I don't like the story, full stop. But if you must see it, watch this film, not the newer one.

For me, it's saying this it's a completely difficult one to judge. I really cannot say whether it's a bad film or a good one &#150; it's neither. It was obviously made for big bucks at the box-office, but it is quite hard to tell if Bay was interested in creating a good movie or not.Pilots Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) have been best friends since childhood. Soon, Rafe finds out that he has to leave for England to fight with the RAF during pre-WWII for America. He soon says goodbye to Danny, and his loving girlfriend, Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale). When Rafe is supposedly shot down in France, Danny tells Evelyn. Soon, the two fall in love and turn to one another after the tragedy. But, months later, it turns out that Rafe is still alive and comes to visit Evelyn and Danny at their new base in Hawaii. Though the three are held in a tough situation, it gets even worse the next day when the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor, drawing America into World War II.I don't know whether I should begin stating the strengths or weaknesses &#150; so I'm going to do both. I'll start with the main relation to the title- the attack sequence. The special effects are stunning. The scene would have been an achievement in cinematic action scenes if it weren't for the film's bad reputation. Not including the beginning or aftermath, the attack lasts over half an hour. That means, as exhilarating as it is, it's very hard to watch soldiers and innocent people being shot and blown up. It is very depressing, and not very fun to watch.Michael Bay is best known for making loud action pictures (The Rock, Bad Boys), and many label this as his worst film. I really do think that this is one of his harder works, but I would not call this a good movie either, and nor did I not enjoy it much. It seems like Bay would rather concentrate on the action and effects rather than the characters and their emotions (with a good screenplay).The script in the film seems completely rushed and written without much thought. Pearl Harbor has very weak comedy, tedious love exchanges between the characters, and a clichéd, predictable outcome. I think Bay has tried too hard to create a Hollywood, love-story action masterpiece, but since it comes off as both a 'guy movie' and a 'chick flick' with such strong manner, it probably won't appeal to either sex.The love sequence is probably the film's main weakness. Like the script, the love story has been recycled in many other films, mainly reminding us of Titanic. Titanic had a fresh love story, great visuals, wonderful acting, and a terrific script. Pearl Harbor is missing over half of these qualities. Pearl Harbor was meant to portray America as a tough nation during WWII, but Bay belabors the point, and almost makes it Anti-Japanese (especially by giving us an unnecessary last 1\/3 of the film showing a revenge attack).I admit, the acting is not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. Affleck is pretty bad, yes, but he has done worse. Hartnett actually isn't too bad, but was better in Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down. The supporting performances are pretty poor, aside of familiar faces such as Cuba Gooding Jr., Jon Voight, Alec Baldwin and Tom Sizemore.Overall, I would say that Pearl Harbor is an epic cinematic disappointment. A movie that could have been so much more than it is. However, it is a prime example of today's movie-making &#150; how some films are made strictly for money, and not good criticism. I would say that I don't recommend Pearl Harbor, but if you are a hardcore action movie fan, who can stand a long running length and a cheesy script, then go for it. Not really a bad film, just one that could have made itself so much more. 2.5 out of 5 stars.

Pearl Harbor was meant to portray America as a tough nation during WWII, but Bay belabors the point, and almost makes it Anti-Japanese (especially by giving us an unnecessary last 1\/3 of the film showing a revenge attack).I admit, the acting is not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. Affleck is pretty bad, yes, but he has done worse. Hartnett actually isn't too bad, but was better in Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down. The supporting performances are pretty poor, aside of familiar faces such as Cuba Gooding Jr., Jon Voight, Alec Baldwin and Tom Sizemore.Overall, I would say that Pearl Harbor is an epic cinematic disappointment. A movie that could have been so much more than it is. However, it is a prime example of today's movie-making &#150; how some films are made strictly for money, and not good criticism. I would say that I don't recommend Pearl Harbor, but if you are a hardcore action movie fan, who can stand a long running length and a cheesy script, then go for it. Not really a bad film, just one that could have made itself so much more. 2.5 out of 5 stars.

For me, it's saying this it's a completely difficult one to judge. I really cannot say whether it's a bad film or a good one &#150; it's neither. It was obviously made for big bucks at the box-office, but it is quite hard to tell if Bay was interested in creating a good movie or not.Pilots Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) have been best friends since childhood. Soon, Rafe finds out that he has to leave for England to fight with the RAF during pre-WWII for America. He soon says goodbye to Danny, and his loving girlfriend, Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale). When Rafe is supposedly shot down in France, Danny tells Evelyn. Soon, the two fall in love and turn to one another after the tragedy. But, months later, it turns out that Rafe is still alive and comes to visit Evelyn and Danny at their new base in Hawaii. Though the three are held in a tough situation, it gets even worse the next day when the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor, drawing America into World War II.I don't know whether I should begin stating the strengths or weaknesses &#150; so I'm going to do both. I'll start with the main relation to the title- the attack sequence. The special effects are stunning. The scene would have been an achievement in cinematic action scenes if it weren't for the film's bad reputation. Not including the beginning or aftermath, the attack lasts over half an hour. That means, as exhilarating as it is, it's very hard to watch soldiers and innocent people being shot and blown up. It is very depressing, and not very fun to watch.Michael Bay is best known for making loud action pictures (The Rock, Bad Boys), and many label this as his worst film. I really do think that this is one of his harder works, but I would not call this a good movie either, and nor did I not enjoy it much. It seems like Bay would rather concentrate on the action and effects rather than the characters and their emotions (with a good screenplay).The script in the film seems completely rushed and written without much thought. Pearl Harbor has very weak comedy, tedious love exchanges between the characters, and a clichéd, predictable outcome. I think Bay has tried too hard to create a Hollywood, love-story action masterpiece, but since it comes off as both a 'guy movie' and a 'chick flick' with such strong manner, it probably won't appeal to either sex.The love sequence is probably the film's main weakness.

It definitely makes a case for one of the most talked-about, hyped up, and controversial films of the 1990's. It is a masterpiece of film-making, but I would not necessarily call the film a favorite of mine.The story is about two mass murderers who go on a killing spree across America. It started as a murder out of rage from their pasts, but they are influenced to kill again from the media's coverage for them, and their fame across the nation, and even the world. After killing dozens of people, they are finally caught by Officer Scagnetti (brother of a character mentioned in Reservoir Dogs). In prison, Reporter Wayne Gale offers Mickey to express his feelings on TV and what made and makes him a murderer.Now, the storyline may not sound very interesting, but you have to see it to believe it. When I first saw the film (I saw the Director's Cut first), I didn't like it at all, and thought that the overuse of style and violence totally killed the film. But after watching the theatrical version months after seeing the Special edition, I have different thoughts on the film.One of the main reasons that this film was controversial was because of the violence. In the theatrical version, I had no objection to the use of it. Knowing that I was purposely viewed it and saw the media's coverage of the killers in a sick way, I didn't take it as seriously. In the Director's Cut, there was an overkill of violence that didn't make me find much else.Another reason could be what goes on inside the killer's minds (The demon). When I first saw it, I thought What is this??? to myself. I found it very messed up, bizarre, and the weakest and most horrible part of the movie. But now I understand what everything means. This isn't a motive for serial killers, but what went on inside the minds had to do with the mood that they were in. And that didn't only happen with the killers, but other characters in the film that do crazy things.Natural Born Killers is a scary film. But it isn't scary because of just Mickey and Mallory's actions, but how everyone reacts to them. The rest of the world encourages them to keep on what they are doing. One random teenager being asked about them says Not that I believe in all these killing, but if I were a mass murderer, I'd be Mickey and Mallory. The film is much scarier where you realize that Mickey and Mallory are not only the crazy ones, but everyone else is too in a somewhat corrupt and twisted society. However, the dark comedy is unexpected, but does good with its presence.I can't really say that I recommend the Director's Cut of the film, but some might find it better. The extra bit that is added in is mostly more violence that kind of draws the film away from the message. The deleted scenes aren't good at all, in my opinion. However, we do get to see prison inmate Denis Leary much crazier than everyone else, which was somewhat interesting. The alternate ending may be worth a look.This is arguably Oliver Stone's most daring film. Stone, not new to controversy, gives us probably his most mixed and stylish film to date. Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July, and JFK being three of my all time favorite films, Stone is one of the best directors of modern cinema.In the end, Natural Born Killers does come off as a powerful and unforgettable experience in movies that I may never see again. It is bizarre, strange, chaotic, and brilliantly made. It isn't for all tastes, and not for the squeamish. See it at your own risk as this film varies different opinions. 4 out of 5 stars.
