But at times it can become boring? What I mean is at times, don't you get bored listening to the characters explaining every new part of the story like they want to burn it into our brains? The plot Thomas Anderson\/Neo (Keanu Reeves) receives different messages from a man named Morpheus... I was bored until the action scenes. The cast is no problem. Its the sometimes boring plot that stops and starts again. Reloaded was much better as it had the same kind story as the first Matrix, but balancing it with excellent action scenes. The less said about Revolutions the better.So there you have it. Reloaded better. ","genre":null},{"date":"29 March 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Neo.
