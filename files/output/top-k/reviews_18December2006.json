I believe that a great film satisfies all of those. I have seen about three films in my life (Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind, Donnie Darko and Lantana) which satisfy all of these categories, and I was really beginning to wonder whether or not I could come across one which I thought was perfect...I watched Requiem For A Dream about a week ago when I had chickenpox, and just as I am when I watch any film of its caliber, I was cautious. But it did something to me which no other film ever has and probably ever will. It left me so amazed, shocked, terrified, saddened and intrigued that I proceeded to watch it another three times after-wards before I couldn't watch it anymore...It has a brilliant ensemble cast, probably the best I've ever seen in a film. Ellen Burnstyn had me crying quite hard by the end as I watched her truly sweet and charming character of Sara Goldfarb slowly deteriorate because of an addiction. I cannot believe she was denied an Oscar for this role, because it's among the best on-screen performances I've ever seen.It would be a crime in my mind to not commend Jared Leto on his performance. The job he does in the film seems to be quite underrated, but his role as Harry Goldfarb came out as my favourite character. His acting is superb in all senses, and its clear to me that his research into the role paid off. Big time. Because he's put me off drugs of all forms with his depiction of an addict.Jennifer Connely could've very easily made her character of Marion Silver a melodramatic, difficult to watch hunk of s***, but thank the good lord she didn't. It takes a great actor to walk the fine line between real and fake, and she does it so wonderfully well. She may have been playing a supporting role, but it never seemed that way to me. Her performance will stay with me for a long time to come.Before this film, I didn't know who Marlon Wayans was or what his filmography was like. But I finished this film amazed at the performance he gave, and the fact that he managed to make me remember his character of Tyrone C Love (who I believe I could've easily forgotten if it had've been played wrong). Amazingly well done.The directing is nothing short of amazing. Darren Aronofsky creates an excellent mood, making great use of cameras mounted to the actors, hallucination sequences, split camera shots and shows he his artistic sense in a brilliant montage at the end of the film, which was one of my highlights, and the score is beautiful, and makes the mood even more hostile at times.All up, Requiem For A Dream is not for the squeamish or faint of heart, but it's a film that everyone should see at some time in their lives. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that you may never see another film that leaves you more scared, shocked and effected mentally than Requiem For A Dream.For that reason I give it 10\/10. I loved it...Sincerely, Dave Ward.

I loved it and was forever hooked on everything Adam. I collected every film I had ever seen him in for years to come; First on videotape, then later, on DVD. Then I found a website called IMDb.com where I copied a list of every motion picture he had been involved in (Producer, Actor, even Cameos), and proceeded to complete my collection. This brought me across a movie entitled Going Overboard. After purchasing the movie at a 2nd hand video store, I sat down and was subjected to the smelliest piece of cinematic excrement since Rubberface, to which I think this movie holds more than one similarity.

However, as it is, the ridiculous plot is actually dragged further into the abyss by the awful one liners delivered by the finest comedian of our generation.

A monster planet that devours everything in its path&#133;and it's heading for the small planet of Cybertron where a unique race of transforming robots continue to fight a civil war&#133;a war between good and evil that has raged for millions of years. The evil Decepticon Transformers, led by the maniacal Megatron, have sworn to crush their enemies, the Autobots. To this end they have relentlessly pursued them across the galaxy to planet Cybertron to planet Earth and back again. But the heroic Autobot Transformers and their courageous leader Optimus Prime are not easily defeated. By 2005 the Decepticons have conquered the planet of Cybertron but, unknown to them, the Autobots are hidden on two of Cybertron's moons preparing to retake the planet.Years ago I used to read the weekly comic book (and did so until it finished in issue 330 or whatever) and also had a box of the toys. As I got older I forgot all about it and sadly all the comics and toys went the way of the jumble sale &#150; a charitable type of sale before E-Bay made shopkeepers of us all. With the news of a big budget version due next year I decided to revisit this one to remind myself what it was all about. I surprised myself by how much I remembered and how hearing the names of the characters brought back a lot of the old stories to me (specifically Soundwave, Blaster, Bumblebee and others). To some degree these waves of memory and nostalgia helped me get into the story despite, after a powerful opening, an ambling establishing approach. The plot was also familiar to me so I assume that it was from the comic series or the movie was just coming back to me.Assuming familiarity with the characters to be a given to some degree, the plot is actually pretty engaging, with plenty of deaths, action and good (for the time) animation. Although it does not have a real depth or complexity for adults it is very good for children &#150; colourful and engaging but with a real dark edge. Fans of the Transformers will lap it up of course but it isn't solid enough for the casual adult viewer to get into &#150; although maybe the remake could change all that? The voice cast is quite impressive and it is a shame that the material doesn't give them a lot to work with in regards characterisation. It is a shame in a way that this was Welles' and Scatman Crothers' final film but it does make it a curiosity if nothing else. Some of the voices annoyed me (the Dinobots were far too simple) but people like Nimoy, Stack and Kasem all have the sort of voices that suit the metallic delivery. Conversely Idle doesn't work at all while Welker is mixed (good in some roles but irritating as Wheelie). The animation is impressive throughout even if it does feel rather quaint now.Overall then a reasonably effective film for children and Transformer fans. The plot sees plenty going on while the animation is mostly very good. The pop music has dated it and takes away from the dark edge that it has. Not perfect then but considering some of the sh1t that benefits from 80's nostalgia cool, this is actually worth a look.

He's been trained under the supervision of the Soviet Union Boxing league, and he's surpassed any opponent he's faced.Reason why is because of his strength in punching. One punch and he destroys his opponent. This was broadcast on the News, and they announced that they want to challenge the U.S.'s own Heavy Weight Champion. Apollo saw the whole thing on his TV, and went to Rocky's Manor to tell him about his plan in fighting the amateur boxer. Adrian doesn't consider it a wise idea, because it's been years since the last time Apollo boxed. But Apollo has confidants that he can beat the Communist because of his years of experience. Rocky agrees to aide him during the fight along with Duke, and Paulie.With a good performance started at the fight in Las Vegas, it ended in disaster. I won't review what happens there, see it in the movie for yourself. But after Apollo's defeat, Rocky isn't going to let a Russian get away without a fight. So he travels to Russia to challenge Ivan to a match on Christmas. But if Apollo couldn't beat Ivan, does that mean Rocky would face the same fate? See the match, and know that Rocky will show the Red Army what America is made out of.This sequel is pretty cool. Despite Rocky facing his most lethal opponent ever. And this was made when the Soviet Union was still in power. But it does have some good training sequences and a breathe taking fight. just a note that the Apollo Creed Fans might dislike this one. So I suggest renting it first.

Fortunately for Spielberg, his shark nightmarish project became one of the most glorious movies of its kind and a landmark in Hollywood history.That kind of hellish shooting mood was also felt by Francis Ford Coppola during the making of Apocalypse Now and there again, we can see that it was rewarding. But just imagine if Godzilla makers said that their movie was a difficult one to make...Jaws is a very particular film. Not only in its story, but especially on the legacy it gives to the whole film industry. It was the first movie to break the nine-digit profit (and thus becoming the highest-grossing film ever at the time), the one that established summertime as the dominant period of the year for cinema and one of the greatest high concept films of all time.Jaws has a very simple story and relatively simple characters. But it succeeds, simply because it doesn't try to force itself to become more interesting. It stays simple and the natural flow takes on.The synopsis could be summarized with these six little words A shark attacks a coastal town. This shark, a dangerous Great White as we learn, tries to get a meal from the local swimmers and it terrorizes the little summer town. With the profitable season rolling in and the big national holiday approaching, the mayor doesn't want to get the beaches closed but as a near-fatality involves the son of police chief Brody (Roy Scheider), things get more and more serious.This first part of the movie is good. Very good, actually. But it's only a curtain-raiser for the really interesting part which is the hunt for this devil-sent shark on the ocean.The three passengers are Brody, oceanographer Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and experienced mariner and former WWII soldier Quint (Robert Shaw). The triangle interaction between them and the shark hunt are the only elements that we need in order to get the great show we want.Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw offer performances which are among their personal best ones. Scheider, as Chief Brody, shows that he is a skillful police officer but that he has a great fear of water. Dreyfuss is the near-nerd and he is very convincing.Shaw is perhaps the best of the three. He plays his role of fisherman with solid professionalism and his jargon can only give more credibility. But it's his two monologues which moves him above the other characters. First, he introduces himself to the other citizens in town and he sets the table for his later appearance. Second, his unforgettable speech about his dramatic experience aboard the USS Indianapolis (We delivered the bomb) and the tragedies of the soldiers who died attacked by sharks is unarguably fascinating and it ranks as one of the greatest monologues ever delivered by any character in any modern movie.Other than the three major characters, Jaws impresses with its pre-ILM special effects. The mechanical shark (nicknamed Bruce) looks so real that we forget its artificial nature. More impressive, we can feel its personality by its cruel attacks on weak humans and on Quint's boat and also by its empty black eyes.The underwater camera shooting of the swimmers' legs, accompanied by John Williams' Oscar-winning cello score, is already legendary. This is the kind of shot that is repetitive but surprisingly never spoils the suspense. On the contrary, watching the legs approaching from the camera with the tempo speeding up is exhilarating and frightening.I don't like that the shark be killed with a bottle of compressed air, but it provides some great elements anyway. The visual shooting of the shark 'explosion' is impeccable, but it's the music that hooked me. Instead of hearing a triumphing fanfare of trumpets, drums and flutes, we find ourselves listening to a sad succession of falling piano notes, which gives the impression that the shark's death is tearful instead of happy and resolving.At only 29, Spielberg showed what kind of path he would take with Jaws for the rest of his career and the famed shark movie remains one of its greatest thrilling rides, as well as the very definition of contemporary commercial cinema.But in a sense, even if it's a supremely good movie, there's some kind of bitterness in its legacy.

This is sad, because it opened the doors for a new generation of filmmakers, driven by the attract of money and totally uninterested in the artistic side of movie-making.

Nothing however compares to the original film interpretation. How can one not laugh when George (Jimmy Stewart) and Mary (Donna Reed) accidentally fall into the high school gym swimming pool after Mary ditched a potential suitor (Carl Alfalfa Switzer)? Or not get touched by George's speech defending his late father to Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore)? Certainly the last hour as George feels the world tumbling before him and his eventual appreciation of his life are some of the most tear-and-laugh inducing scenes I've ever seen in the movies or television. It's a Wonderful Life has always been my favorite movie and nothing I've ever seen has even come close. Kudos to Stewart and director Frank Capra for such a life-affirming project. Thanks also to Barrymore, Reed, Switzer, Samuel S. Hinds (George's father Peter), Beulah Bondi (George's mom), Thomas Mitchell (Uncle Billy), H.B. Warner (Gower the druggist), Gloria Grahame (Violet Bick), Lilian Randolph (Annie the maid), Sheldon Leonard (Nick the bartender), Ward Bond (Bert the cop), Frank Faylen (Ernie the taxi driver), Bill Edmunds (Martini), and Charles Lane in his role as the guy who tells Potter about George's Bailey Park plans for filling the picture with, in Nick's words a little atmosphere. Add to that all the various kid and adult actors I can't remember right now. And finally, special thanks to Henry Travers (Clarence) for making us all believe in angels. No truer words have ever been written as the one in Clarence's book gift (The Adventures of Tom Sawyer) to George No man is a failure who has friends. Though one may quibble about Harry not being saved without George despite other friends near him or Mary becoming an old maid, It's a Wonderful Life is a flawless masterpiece that has stood the test of time for the last 60 years. May it stand forevermore. P.S. Look for the Blondie movie series' kid stars Larry Baby Dumpling\/Alexander Bumstead Simms (George's son Pete) and Danny Alvin Fuddle Mummert (Little Marty Hatch).

Famous for managing to capture so much detail in one frame of delight, even in the darkest and deadliest moments of his films he retains a naturally deliberate comedic affect. I've always been a great fan of Kubrick cinema as he's managed to tell devastatingly bleak tales of life and death with such ease and rhythm. Fact is Kubrick knows how you should tell a story through film.Barry Lyndon is a film that has an extensive range on offer to its viewers and with grand visual openness. From the narrative opening showing a fire-armed duel, in a gloomy Irish setting and a long-haul shot of the two men standing across from one-an-other, you automatically know you in for a cinematic treat. The film follows the Irish rouge Barry Lyndon's life; he's not from a wealthy background and strives to become a wealthy British aristocrat during the annoyances of the 18th century Seven Year European War.Barry Lyndon stands out as a true cinematic delight, a masterpiece if you will and a genuine epic classic that has stood the test of time and remains one of the best films ever made. Barry Lyndon came out in the pinnacle of the 70s and managed to receive many awards and praise from critics. I've always adored Barry Lyndon, but it wasn't until a repeat viewing that I finally decided it's my favourite film. Some have called Barry Lyndon repetitive or as flawed beauty, I see those as foolish opinions because to appreciate the film you have to be able to understand it by looking deeper than what's obvious to the viewer. The film is not remotely dull or repetitive because it's a film that grasps you throughout the stretch and pulls you into one man's compelling quest through life.Barry Lyndon has become somewhat of an uncommonly mentioned film that has been forgotten by many and yet remains loved and hailed by others. It's a story that is structured precisely to the minute details and adapted with outstanding delicate appreciation to William Makepeace Thackeray novel.Like most Kubrick films it has subtle humorous undertones and devastating moments of dramatic parallels help make the film have the glorious variety throughout the three hour running time. The story is structured so delicately that there is not a single moment where you're not enthralled or captivated from one of the film's examples of overwhelming excellence. The pacing never falters, nor does it lose any of the originality it holds. There's so much on offer in one frame that you'll want to replay a single still-shot over and over.Kubrick is a perfectionist and he's famous for having that personality trait, his arrogant and compulsive attitudes have managed to bring some of his actors to the verge of breakdown. Werner Herzog is another artistic genius who has some insane traits surrounding his work, but don't they say even the greatest artists are a little mad.The cinematography is some of the most luxurious your eyes will ever have the absolute pleasure of meeting. Even in the most shattering, sorrowful and heart-wrenching moments of the film there's a suppressing beauty withering its way onto the screen. The wonderfully impressive shots of the British countryside setting the scenes for the overwhelming clouds with pouring sunlight squeezing its way through show the comprehensive beauty the world has on offer. The fact the film was shot in natural light, it shown through the wide and ambitious landscape surrounding Barry Lyndon. It shows how there is such a great deal of life surrounding us all and yet we seem blissfully unaware of this.Generally the film's technical aspects cannot be described by anything less than perfect. The mesmerising classical score the film holds helps to create the cold and anti-humanist idea the film is portraying. Another prime feature of Barry Lyndon is that Kubrick found his motivation through some of the 18th century's painters who have obviously helped Kubrick decide what costumes would be able to illustrate the period in time. Easily some of the most impressive and detailed items of clothing ever put on screen, deserving the Oscar for Best Costume Design. The set pieces are also a fantastic part of the film and the realism is stunning. The use of British heritage to set the scenes for some of the housing, the sweeping fields of hills, the winding roads and the ruined half-castles provide the needed pragmatism.Some films that revolve around one character's travels can fail to capture the audience, but Barry Lyndon manages to expertly lead you through the shoes of Mr. Lyndon's life. You'll notice how his character changes as the film progresses, some of his characteristics, habits and usual emotions change. The film studies the arrogance, lying charm and sly individualism surrounding the anti-hero. Ryan O'Neal shows-off his outlandish and shy acting style perfectly with what is one of the untouchable performances of the 70s.The film remains a film buff's dream, a director's ambition and a historian's paradise. My all-time favourite film and one that remains one of the greatest achievements cinema has on offer, I beg you to watch this.

Even in the most shattering, sorrowful and heart-wrenching moments of the film there's a suppressing beauty withering its way onto the screen. The wonderfully impressive shots of the British countryside setting the scenes for the overwhelming clouds with pouring sunlight squeezing its way through show the comprehensive beauty the world has on offer. The fact the film was shot in natural light, it shown through the wide and ambitious landscape surrounding Barry Lyndon. It shows how there is such a great deal of life surrounding us all and yet we seem blissfully unaware of this.Generally the film's technical aspects cannot be described by anything less than perfect. The mesmerising classical score the film holds helps to create the cold and anti-humanist idea the film is portraying. Another prime feature of Barry Lyndon is that Kubrick found his motivation through some of the 18th century's painters who have obviously helped Kubrick decide what costumes would be able to illustrate the period in time. Easily some of the most impressive and detailed items of clothing ever put on screen, deserving the Oscar for Best Costume Design. The set pieces are also a fantastic part of the film and the realism is stunning. The use of British heritage to set the scenes for some of the housing, the sweeping fields of hills, the winding roads and the ruined half-castles provide the needed pragmatism.Some films that revolve around one character's travels can fail to capture the audience, but Barry Lyndon manages to expertly lead you through the shoes of Mr. Lyndon's life. You'll notice how his character changes as the film progresses, some of his characteristics, habits and usual emotions change. The film studies the arrogance, lying charm and sly individualism surrounding the anti-hero. Ryan O'Neal shows-off his outlandish and shy acting style perfectly with what is one of the untouchable performances of the 70s.The film remains a film buff's dream, a director's ambition and a historian's paradise. My all-time favourite film and one that remains one of the greatest achievements cinema has on offer, I beg you to watch this.

Famous for managing to capture so much detail in one frame of delight, even in the darkest and deadliest moments of his films he retains a naturally deliberate comedic affect. I've always been a great fan of Kubrick cinema as he's managed to tell devastatingly bleak tales of life and death with such ease and rhythm. Fact is Kubrick knows how you should tell a story through film.Barry Lyndon is a film that has an extensive range on offer to its viewers and with grand visual openness. From the narrative opening showing a fire-armed duel, in a gloomy Irish setting and a long-haul shot of the two men standing across from one-an-other, you automatically know you in for a cinematic treat. The film follows the Irish rouge Barry Lyndon's life; he's not from a wealthy background and strives to become a wealthy British aristocrat during the annoyances of the 18th century Seven Year European War.Barry Lyndon stands out as a true cinematic delight, a masterpiece if you will and a genuine epic classic that has stood the test of time and remains one of the best films ever made. Barry Lyndon came out in the pinnacle of the 70s and managed to receive many awards and praise from critics. I've always adored Barry Lyndon, but it wasn't until a repeat viewing that I finally decided it's my favourite film. Some have called Barry Lyndon repetitive or as flawed beauty, I see those as foolish opinions because to appreciate the film you have to be able to understand it by looking deeper than what's obvious to the viewer. The film is not remotely dull or repetitive because it's a film that grasps you throughout the stretch and pulls you into one man's compelling quest through life.Barry Lyndon has become somewhat of an uncommonly mentioned film that has been forgotten by many and yet remains loved and hailed by others. It's a story that is structured precisely to the minute details and adapted with outstanding delicate appreciation to William Makepeace Thackeray novel.Like most Kubrick films it has subtle humorous undertones and devastating moments of dramatic parallels help make the film have the glorious variety throughout the three hour running time. The story is structured so delicately that there is not a single moment where you're not enthralled or captivated from one of the film's examples of overwhelming excellence. The pacing never falters, nor does it lose any of the originality it holds. There's so much on offer in one frame that you'll want to replay a single still-shot over and over.Kubrick is a perfectionist and he's famous for having that personality trait, his arrogant and compulsive attitudes have managed to bring some of his actors to the verge of breakdown.

Dirty Harry catches everyone's attention and unless one wants to watch romance, there is no reason why you won't like him. He is cool because he is dirty, is great because he kills without much thinking, is perfect because he gets the bullet right through your heart and a hero because he doesn't care.From what I have seen in movies in which Eastwood acts, the character of the lead role always captivates the audience. In White Hunter Black heart, he is the crazy director, in in the Line of Fire he is the Old 'un while here is the almost jobless with his job, that is to say he makes work for himself, doesn't care one damn about his superiors who practically send him out for a vacation.Based on a rape victim, this movie is promising for all the no non-sense movie watchers. The movie has nothing that goes away from he central plot. However, what makes it slightly inferior to the better movies of Eastwood is that though the character of the lead role is captivating the plot is not, as it is far too obvious from the beginning. It is not a movie that is going to make you sit at a place without moving. Also, there are too many people far dirtier than Dirty harry.
