This is one of the few movies that I can sit there and get more enjoyment when i see it over and over again (which is rare in my case). I didn't want to see this movie after i saw bubble boy. I was surprised by the performances. Even Patrick Swayze and Drew Barrymore did a great job. Every movie I've seen them in is usually Hollywood garbage (Charlie's Angels, Black Dog, etc.). Granted, they probably didn't get paid that much doing this movie.This movie is great because you can come to your own conclusions about the story. After the movie you can talk to your friends about what you believed just happened and what was hard to understand about the movie. You don't get these conversations after seeing 'Van Helsing' (I wonder why this movie was ever made).A lot of people will not like this movie because it requires you to think, which is fine by me. This movie has a huge cult following as it is and doesn't need everybody to enjoy it. The look of the film is amazing. The film represents the weird emotions of high school and youth, mixed with science fiction. You're on the edge of your seat to see what will happen at the end of the film. You get all the clues of why events are happening and you still don't understand at the end of the film, but you take these theories for the next time you watch the film.I hope more movies like this come out with a similar look and imagination. There's only so much pointless Hollywood action movies i can take (just seeing the endless commercials on TV is enough). I highly recommend this movie to people with an open mind who are not afraid to think for themselves.

Frank is so damn funny and engrossing, the movie was bound to be a hit. Frankly I love the damn dog. He throws one liners, has great scenes (especially while driving around with J), and even converses naturally about women. The best line has to be I'm attracted to her and she's not even my species. It was clear J was smitten and Frank, ever smitten with J and MIB, called it. He's not a new personality, but he's not old and he's not overused.Tommy Lee Jones is talented and can stretch any character. He starts humorous, which should have been natural and was, before giving way to his prior character. This again was how it should have been - - it was readjustment. Will Smith may have garnered acclaim for Ali, and regardless of reviews and appearances, looked decent in I, Robot; moreover, he has grit in this movie. Particularly, he is quite good in the beginning before settling into his typical, but still engaging antics. The Jeff part that transverses to the pie sequence is followed by major desperation in J's character. It's unforeseen and initially awkward; however, as his relationship with Laura festers with possibility it becomes more natural and fitting. K gave that to us in the end of Men in Black with his obsession of stars. The first movie rushed that and it was a bit contrived, but Jones was able to slow it down and make it work.How J keeps Putty (come on he has no other name, although he isn't a bad actor) for five months as his partner, is beyond me. Especially because K trains J in two days in the first film. The reason it gets me is how awkward they still are and how dumb he still is (although J hits on this).Before I get to Lara Flynn Boyle, I have to express disappointment in Bo Welch. The costumes of the aliens weren't horrible, but rather really out there and unable to be taken seriously. The first time the aliens were real and the movie rough, but this time it's all about the humor. The aliens designed to bring in K for Lara's character are horrible (a ball-chinian? It's somewhat humorous but it gets ruined when K performs a improbable kick. Even worse is Rip Torn's paddle on Lara Flynn Boyle). The problem with this movie is it is so jokey. I can't stand the automatic driver, and why is a playstation controller the only thing that can commandeer this damn machine at hyperspeed? Overall I love Jack Jeebs, Knoxville's character is forgettable, Ben is cool for five seconds (I get the feeling he cares), Dawson is decent, but K and J are still the men. This movie was focused on J and his definite struggle, not MIB, and that is why the story isn't the focus. But how did David Cross elude being neuralyzed in the first movie? The movie works when the characters act, not when they say choice lines. It's balanced fairly well. And K still throws out some cool guidance to J and leaves the possibility for a MIB III, or MIIIB, if so desired.Lara Flynn Boyle is not bad, but the woman in power line is just poorly delivered, but fitting because it is Men in Black. She honestly seems dumb because she wastes 25 years and still doesn't locate the light; Knoxville's character does. She works though, especially toward the end and is bright enough to use her sexuality to her advantage. Not to mention her stuffing her face is kind of funny to keep tracking. And the robot alien is wickedly, wickedly cool (while K and J are apparently clairvoyant). Mostly I say enjoy this movie because you should laugh and you get a decent story.

There's been lots of movies with the be rich in Vegas shindig and this one isn't too different. you've got your stereotypical Big Shot money guys here and all kinds of sleezebags, but there's also a few warm-hearted people in Vegas who will take you in and help you get on your feet. Shes tossed around from a strip club to the Stardust theater by the lead star who has an almost obsessive attraction to her, regardless that Nomi hates her.Acting 5- James, Nomi's victim of chance bad luck throughout the movie was really fake and unrealistic. Almost everything that came out of his mouth seemed like he was reading a script. Crystal also had a way with words and seemed like she had nothing better to do in the movie but to be evil. Nomi was well.... exactly like her character in SavedByTheBell! Very very stubborn and always got her way. She and the rest of the girls all had amazing dance skills but acted like everything that happened to them threw them into an anger fit.Music 6- Maybe this movie should have been a musical, or at least had some musical numbers in it. There were quite a few showgirl performances but they only show about 2 mins of it at most. Still the Vegas shows in the movie were very powerful and cool.Costumes 8- Nomi goes through over 20 different wardrobe changes in this movie. Gstrings, Leather, glittering bikini, and plenty of other stripper outfits. They're all really nice looking and even when she bares all, her look is very beautiful. Cristal, being the lead star of the performance also has some great outfits, most of which heighten her character's evilness.Camera-work \/ Lighting 8- Vegas has always been a great place for amazing lighting and camera effects and this movie was no stranger. The sets were nicely lit and the scenes showing the landscaping of Vegas were very nice. There's a shot of her by her car staring at the Flamingo's swirling pink flashing lights and another in front of the Pyramid & Sphinx of the Luxor. Even James' shack of a house had nice camera work for the dances.Editing 7- Kind of a jumble at times but its a pretty straightforward storyline. Some characters don't go into detail as much with who they are and why they're trying to get back at Nomi but the majority of back story is explained. It could have used more side stories of other characters in the movie other than Nomi to explain how they got where they are.Uniqueness 4- Its a Vegas movie, but hell... its also a story of a tough girl working her way to the top. Its been done before yeah, but this movie has made a reputation of itself. While its not anything new to Vegas movies, it has its hokeyness that will bring audiences to see how things end up.Worth 6- a big BIG reason most people watched this (myself included) would to see our favorite bookworm Saved By The Bell girl get down and nasty and yes, you get to see her in full nude. The rape scene in the NC-17 version isn't anything too racy and the sex scene with Zack was all underwater so there wasn't anything to see there anyway. Aside from that its got plenty of T & A for people who just want some stripper action.Overall Score (Not an average) 7- People aren't going to watch this to see a deep involving story of a girl who grows to be a sweetheart after making it to the top. They want to see Jessie Spano, thats what they'll get. Her character is definitely way beyond overacting and everyone around her is scheming and evil but hey, thats what Vegas is like right? Its still worth a watch with friends to laugh at some of the corny lines but its not a BAD movie, it just falls in some obscure adult audience category that few people care to see.Reviewer's Insight (Including bias) So Okay, I got the movie for Elizabeth Berkley, knowing full well that there would be some really dumb plot and characters but what else do people see when they hear about Showgirls? Jessie Spano nude, thats right! I had seen clips of the censored VH-1 version and oh man, it must have taken some major time to not only cut out a LOT of scenes but to censor cussing and, get this, Literally PAINT black bikinis on all of the nudity. Its a lot of work that was regarded as one of the worst films of all time. I can assure you its really not that bad of a film. I, myself even had a chuckle or two at some of the lines, but that doesn't make it a bad film. The women are all pretty hot, and while every character overacts their part, it still keeps a decent story through it. Some amazing shots of Vegas are also in this film , and being to Vegas myself its fun to be able to point out and recognize some of the great places there. The movie is worth a watch, if anything to see plenty of topless dancing and Elizabeth Berkley bare all.

The movie is worth a watch, if anything to see plenty of topless dancing and Elizabeth Berkley bare all.

This film is the darkest installment of the Burton\/Schumacher franchise. The movie has a star cast and Michelle Pfeiffer gives a memorable performance as exotic, seductive, but vile Catwoman. The great Danny Elfman music is all still there. Danny Devito and Christopher Walken bring decent comic relief in their roles as villains.The movie suffers from a silly plot devices and rhetoric , which is ironic considering this is supposedly the darkest, most serious film in the franchise. Yes, its dark, but in a very superficial, stylish way. The film never aroused in emotion of despair or sympathy for any of the characters because it was filled with ridiculous premises. There is more violence in this film, unnecessary death, even some minor blood, but especially near the end, the violent conflicts never seemed to have a point.The big problem with this movie is that its apparent Tim Burton wasn't sure where to take the character of Batman after the first film. Burton essentially focused on making fantastic Burtonized Gotham City and Burtonized villains. Whereas the first movie was somewhat realistic, gritty and a decent Batman film, this movie makes Gotham City more surreal and goth fairy-tail. Burton changes the origins and motivations of the two major villains (The Penguin and Catwoman) DRASTICALLY from their comic counterparts. The Penguin is changed from a deformed, calculating, crime boss into a genetically altered, naive, and angry mutant who lives in the sewers and never knew his parents (who are human). Catwoman's transformation and origin is almost as absurd. Their motivations are so dimensional, Catwoman is reduced to a simplistic poster boy for feminism.The first half of the movie has a decent plot, but after a semi-climax, the movie spins out of control wrecklessly and nothing makes much sense. For all the flack Batman & Robin got for being campy, this movie has the Penguin......talking to and commanding an army of penguins with rockets on their back. I couldn't believe I was seeing this in a what some considers the Best Batman movie of all time. There are too many convenient plot devices and inconsistencies throughout the ending. The other minor characters from the first film are gone or do little to almost nothing in this film.Keaton's Batman is still good and convincing. What's bad though is that the film is even less about Batman waging a war on crime than the previous film, and more about angry, unloved, or ugly people (the hero and the villains) never finding happiness or love that they deserve. Burton definitely imprinted his artistic, fantastic, Gothic but dreary style throughout this film, for better or worse. Thus, this isn't really a superhero film, but a typical Gothic nobody loves me, so I have to wreck havoc film. Batman's dedication to fighting crime is ambiguous in this movie and I don't feel he becomes a stronger or a resolute character in the end.The movie is decent, there are some good action scenes, and as said before Pfieffer is awesome and attractive in this film. Christopher Walken is sometimes funny and Danny Devito has some good scenes. I think the dark nature of the movie has successfully hid the fact that this movie is just as campy and silly as the next two sequels.

Awesome display of martial arts with some gritty violence involved as well, great cinematography, good atmosphere, special effects were good for its time and budget (only a $2 million dollar budget), awesome Post Apocalyptic setting, and the editing was played out smoothed, and good acting (for the setting) and characters.Albert Pyun in my opinion is one of the most underrated directors in film. Here are my reasons why, he was an apprentice to Akira Kursawa, and he is a Sergio Leone fan and you can see it his impact in Pyun's, and Pyun can do film-making in away that he doesn't need huge budgets and expensive actors. Pyun was also inspired by Sam Peckinpah and John Woo (during the 90s). That is why I feel that he is underrated and not just a hack or a rip off.Anyways the basic story of this great movie is that Gibson Rickenbacker (Jean-Claude Van Damme, one of the coolest martial artist to grace the silver screen besides Bruce Lee, Sonny Chiba, and so many other)a drifter and a former salinger (protector,samurai, escort service, and pirate fighter) must rescue a cyborg that has a cure for the plague in the Post Apocalyptic world and fight the pirates led by Fender Tremolo (Played by Vincent Klyn, former champion in surfing and one of the meanest villains to appear in a movie) who have the cyborg and Fender also killed the family that Gibson became involved with a couple years earlier which is shown in flashbacks. This movie has one of the most realistic and amazing fights scenes ever captured on film,they were just simply awesome. The acting was good but many critics and audience members complained that Van Damme doesn't say much and a lot of the villains were screaming and grunting like animals. That was the whole idea, Van Damme was suppose to play the whole silent man with no-name character and the villains were suppose to represent what the people have come down to... savages. Some visuals were just poetry like Kursawa and Leone would have presented and the camera angles were just right, the music was good for being 80s. Like I said in my earlier reviews rent the movie before buying it, do it for sure this movie,I saw part of this movie on TV when I was really young and I was amazed by the action and martial arts and this what got me hooked on the martial arts and then I saw it again because I saw a story being covered on Dateline about Van Damme accidentally hurting an actor during filming and then I rented it and then I received it for present just recently (one of best presents ever) and the rest is history. I just wish that the MPAA wouldn't had got a hold of it and I hope soon that a Director's Cut come soon.If you enjoy this movie I also recommend 'Steel Dawn' and the 'Mad Max' trilogy.

Awesome display of martial arts with some gritty violence involved as well, great cinematography, good atmosphere, special effects were good for its time and budget (only a $2 million dollar budget), awesome Post Apocalyptic setting, and the editing was played out smoothed, and good acting (for the setting) and characters.Albert Pyun in my opinion is one of the most underrated directors in film. Here are my reasons why, he was an apprentice to Akira Kursawa, and he is a Sergio Leone fan and you can see it his impact in Pyun's, and Pyun can do film-making in away that he doesn't need huge budgets and expensive actors. Pyun was also inspired by Sam Peckinpah and John Woo (during the 90s). That is why I feel that he is underrated and not just a hack or a rip off.Anyways the basic story of this great movie is that Gibson Rickenbacker (Jean-Claude Van Damme, one of the coolest martial artist to grace the silver screen besides Bruce Lee, Sonny Chiba, and so many other)a drifter and a former salinger (protector,samurai, escort service, and pirate fighter) must rescue a cyborg that has a cure for the plague in the Post Apocalyptic world and fight the pirates led by Fender Tremolo (Played by Vincent Klyn, former champion in surfing and one of the meanest villains to appear in a movie) who have the cyborg and Fender also killed the family that Gibson became involved with a couple years earlier which is shown in flashbacks. This movie has one of the most realistic and amazing fights scenes ever captured on film,they were just simply awesome. The acting was good but many critics and audience members complained that Van Damme doesn't say much and a lot of the villains were screaming and grunting like animals. That was the whole idea, Van Damme was suppose to play the whole silent man with no-name character and the villains were suppose to represent what the people have come down to... savages. Some visuals were just poetry like Kursawa and Leone would have presented and the camera angles were just right, the music was good for being 80s.

There's this British bloke who sleeps with this American gal. Just once, mind you. But despite this, he falls hopelessly in love. However, she leaves and doesn't call him back. Then when they see each other again, she's engaged. But for some reason she sleeps with him again. Oh, and then she takes him out shopping with her. As if that isn't torture enough, she's shopping for a wedding dress and makes him watch as she tries on various gowns. What kind of woman is this? And why should I give a damn about her? And how the hell can the filmmakers expect me to be happy when these two imbeciles end up getting married? But then again this a Working Title picture and a film scripted by Richard Curtis. Drivel is their forte.What I hate most about Four Weddings and a Funeral is how mechanical it is. There's not one genuine moment or one piece of sincerity. Its whole purpose is to manipulate in the name of entertainment. Just take the ludicrous sequence of events listed above. It isn't done because it echoes genuine human behaviour. It's done so that the screenplay can move from Point A to Point B. And that's how I really see the film. I see it as plot points. Charles and Carrie have to meet so that the wheel can start turning. Then they have to sleep together so that they Charles can fall in love. But then Carrie has to leave to keep the tension going. However, Carrie has to come back to keep up the interest. But she has to be engaged to provide an obstacle. But then they have to sleep together again to keep the promise of romance later in the film spluttering along. But then she has to leave again to tighten the tension. Then she has to get married to wind the tension even tighter. But then someone has to die so that Charles can come to the conclusion that life is only meaningful if you're married. This of course then means that Charles has to decide to marry someone awful so that we can be jolly pleased when he decides not to and when he decides to marry his true love who has suddenly, miraculously even, recently separated &#150; a woman, let me remind you again, who jerks him about and who rubs her engagement to another man in his face. It's a load of rubbish.It's not very funny either. I think I laughed three times. The first laugh was at the drunk man in the pub, the second was at the awful best man's speech and the third was at the sex scene. Aside from that though, I didn't even crack a smile. Most of the humour fell flat. Just take Rowan Atkinson's cameo. You can see the jokes coming a mile away. Then there's the 'hilarious' swearing. I tell you, Richard Curtis just cannot do swearing. He tries his best in every screenplay he writes but it's so self-conscious that it's cringe worthy. And I'm someone who loves profanity. I mean, it kills me that I can't swear in these reviews, it really does. But Richard Curtis is no Peter Cook, no Ricky Gervais and no Chris Morris. He's just a middle class twit feeding America's preconceptions about Britain &#150; that we're uncomfortable with sex, that we're all loveably quirky and that in every corner there are dancing homosexuals.But the worst thing in the film is actually the American (or Andie MacDowell as she is otherwise known). I've already talked about her ridiculous character but her acting is astoundingly bad. She can't deliver a line. The worst example is, Is it still raining? I hadn't noticed. The line in itself is awful enough, but when it's expressed in a monotone drawl, it's unbearable. And then there's the scene where she plays a joke on Charles. He doesn't know that it's a joke but when he does realise he laughs with relief. Pretty standard stuff. Only Andie MacDowell's laugh is so feeble that she does actually look like the bunny killer stereotype that Charles is laughing at. She doesn't look like she's joking at all. She looks dead serious.But the established actors aren't much better. Simon Callow, in particular, is hideously bad. I mean, he's a good actor, but in this film, like everyone, he tires too damn hard. He's a gay stereotype turned up to 11. I was actually quite thankful when he died so that he could give me a break. But at least Curtis had the good sense to ensure that he didn't die of AIDS. At least he didn't play that cliché.However, the death of Callow's character leads to the terrible funeral scene. It's not moving. It's not emotional. It's just a cynical way to play the audience and to get Charles to the next plot point. He has to see that monogamy is the way to true happiness and that you're a no one if you don't have someone crying at your funeral. What tosh! Then there's the ending. If everything else is just bad, then the ending is offensive. What happens? Why, everyone gets married, of course! (Oh, but not the gay man, you understand. Although he does find a new 'special friend'.) Bloody hell. It's bad in the sense that all the loose ends are tied neatly together but it's even worse in the sense that it sells conformity and belief in an archaic institution as the only road to happiness. How terribly middle class.Oh, and if the film had a brain, and if Charles had a brain too, he would have dumped the American for Kristin Scott Thomas. But we can't have that, can we? That would have killed the transatlantic appeal. ","genre":null},{"date":"9 July 2005","score":"32 out of 57 people found the following review useful","review":" So let me get this straight.

This of course then means that Charles has to decide to marry someone awful so that we can be jolly pleased when he decides not to and when he decides to marry his true love who has suddenly, miraculously even, recently separated &#150; a woman, let me remind you again, who jerks him about and who rubs her engagement to another man in his face. It's a load of rubbish.It's not very funny either. I think I laughed three times. The first laugh was at the drunk man in the pub, the second was at the awful best man's speech and the third was at the sex scene. Aside from that though, I didn't even crack a smile. Most of the humour fell flat. Just take Rowan Atkinson's cameo. You can see the jokes coming a mile away. Then there's the 'hilarious' swearing. I tell you, Richard Curtis just cannot do swearing. He tries his best in every screenplay he writes but it's so self-conscious that it's cringe worthy. And I'm someone who loves profanity. I mean, it kills me that I can't swear in these reviews, it really does. But Richard Curtis is no Peter Cook, no Ricky Gervais and no Chris Morris. He's just a middle class twit feeding America's preconceptions about Britain &#150; that we're uncomfortable with sex, that we're all loveably quirky and that in every corner there are dancing homosexuals.But the worst thing in the film is actually the American (or Andie MacDowell as she is otherwise known). I've already talked about her ridiculous character but her acting is astoundingly bad. She can't deliver a line. The worst example is, Is it still raining? I hadn't noticed. The line in itself is awful enough, but when it's expressed in a monotone drawl, it's unbearable. And then there's the scene where she plays a joke on Charles. He doesn't know that it's a joke but when he does realise he laughs with relief. Pretty standard stuff. Only Andie MacDowell's laugh is so feeble that she does actually look like the bunny killer stereotype that Charles is laughing at. She doesn't look like she's joking at all. She looks dead serious.But the established actors aren't much better. Simon Callow, in particular, is hideously bad. I mean, he's a good actor, but in this film, like everyone, he tires too damn hard. He's a gay stereotype turned up to 11. I was actually quite thankful when he died so that he could give me a break. But at least Curtis had the good sense to ensure that he didn't die of AIDS. At least he didn't play that cliché.However, the death of Callow's character leads to the terrible funeral scene. It's not moving. It's not emotional. It's just a cynical way to play the audience and to get Charles to the next plot point. He has to see that monogamy is the way to true happiness and that you're a no one if you don't have someone crying at your funeral. What tosh! Then there's the ending. If everything else is just bad, then the ending is offensive. What happens? Why, everyone gets married, of course! (Oh, but not the gay man, you understand. Although he does find a new 'special friend'.) Bloody hell. It's bad in the sense that all the loose ends are tied neatly together but it's even worse in the sense that it sells conformity and belief in an archaic institution as the only road to happiness. How terribly middle class.Oh, and if the film had a brain, and if Charles had a brain too, he would have dumped the American for Kristin Scott Thomas. But we can't have that, can we? That would have killed the transatlantic appeal.

There's this British bloke who sleeps with this American gal. Just once, mind you. But despite this, he falls hopelessly in love. However, she leaves and doesn't call him back. Then when they see each other again, she's engaged. But for some reason she sleeps with him again. Oh, and then she takes him out shopping with her. As if that isn't torture enough, she's shopping for a wedding dress and makes him watch as she tries on various gowns. What kind of woman is this? And why should I give a damn about her? And how the hell can the filmmakers expect me to be happy when these two imbeciles end up getting married? But then again this a Working Title picture and a film scripted by Richard Curtis. Drivel is their forte.What I hate most about Four Weddings and a Funeral is how mechanical it is. There's not one genuine moment or one piece of sincerity. Its whole purpose is to manipulate in the name of entertainment. Just take the ludicrous sequence of events listed above. It isn't done because it echoes genuine human behaviour. It's done so that the screenplay can move from Point A to Point B. And that's how I really see the film. I see it as plot points. Charles and Carrie have to meet so that the wheel can start turning. Then they have to sleep together so that they Charles can fall in love. But then Carrie has to leave to keep the tension going. However, Carrie has to come back to keep up the interest. But she has to be engaged to provide an obstacle. But then they have to sleep together again to keep the promise of romance later in the film spluttering along. But then she has to leave again to tighten the tension. Then she has to get married to wind the tension even tighter.

Oh, the plot is full of holes and some of the characters are cardboard but it's enjoyable nonetheless and, more than that, thought provoking.Is the plot full of holes? Well, I don't really know exactly what that means, but the fact is that I have no idea how Klaatu (Michael Rennie) gets out of his locked room at Walter Reed Hospital without breaking through the door or the walls. I also don't know how it's possible for an 8-foot giant robot with a head the size of a beanbag chair to walk across the city of Washington, DC, melt the wall of a government building, pick up the dead body of an alien, and carry it back across town with no one bothering to notice. What do they do, pay Gort what sociologists call civil inattention? And how does Klaatu manage to open the door to Professor Barnhardt's study when Bobby can't? I should say that not all of the characters are cardboard. I was thinking mainly of Pat Neal's boyfriend Tom (Hugh Marlowe), a slimy creep from beginning to end. That mellifluous baritone didn't fool me for a minute. Just watch him light up with glee as he scopes that diamond! And his best scene -- shooing away Pat Neal while he squeals over the phone to the general about Klaatu's whereabouts, telling her, Just wait till I get my picture in the papers. You'll feel differently. I had my picture in the papers once and look where I am now -- The Landru Home for the Criminally Insane, without possibility of grounds privileges! Rennie's Klaatu is not cardboard but is still a bit of a puzzle. Okay, his planet has been monitoring our transmissions for years. So Klaatu, as we would expect, is not only tall and handsome in an ectomorphic way but is gracious and polite as well. He knows all the interactional graces. (Well, I'll say good-night again.) Well then how come he doesn't know the word jittery and isn't familiar with a music box? Huh? There's also a certain smugness about him that I'm not sure I cared for. He smiles and shakes his head with slight amusement at our stupidity.The kid wasn't much better, but I've always like Patricia Neal. Not sure why. She's not a knockout beauty and not a bravura actress but she seems to radiate a sort of integrity or stability that most of the rest of us could use a shot of from time to time.The message that Klaatu brings to Earth is an engaging one. No more of that aggression business on the geopolitical front. At least I think that's what his message is. He himself doesn't actually clarify it. If you people persist, we will destroy your rogue planet. On Klaatu's planet they have outlawed aggression and turned enforcement over to the interplanetary police, of which Gort is an example. The powers of the police cannot be revoked. At the first sign of aggression they turn the aggressor to toast.I've heard this movie called fascist because nobody wants a police force that has zero tolerance for aggression or anything else. But I'm not so sure. We have a police simulacrum built into our brains already. The brain is roughly dividable into three parts (1) the reptilian brain that governs primitive functions like smelling and breathing, (2) the mammalian brain which generates and channels emotions like love and rage, and (3) the human brain, for lack of a better term, the huge cortex that sits on top of the others and damps down and regulates the more primitive emotions. If you remove the cortex in, say, a cat, what you get are digital emotions, either no anger at all or a full-blown rage.The problem with our built-in cop is that, like any other system of social control, it doesn't always work properly. When somebody insults us we hate him and want to punch him. That just human nature, right? You can also call the impulse to do physical damage to another pride or dignity or justifiable homicide or just desserts -- but this is precisely the part of human nature that Tinker Toys like Gort will not tolerate.We remain free to kill those we hate. We can fly airplanes into their buildings or blow up their subways or invade their countries or fry them in an electric chair. We have the freedom to do that. But is this a kind of freedom we want to preserve? The freedom to express our most base impulses, the impulses that make us no different from monkeys or pit bulls or camels? Would we really lose that much if we turned ourselves over to the Gorts of the universe? If biology can't do the job can we turn it over to culture? If high schools can have zero tolerance policies for drug possession and if traffic cops can have zero tolerance for speeding, why not zero tolerance for killing? The Ten Commandments tells us clearly Thou Shallt Not Kill, without adding dozens of footnotes.The question is rhetorical. I don't know the answer. But the movie prompts us to ask it of ourselves, if we don't simply close down our logic when Klaatu starts going on about police and absolute power and irrevocable. (An image forms out of Spiritus Mundi -- an Aryan in a Gestapo uniform.) Of course we hesitate. Anyone would. Klaatu has held back an important piece of information about Gort.

Well, I don't really know exactly what that means, but the fact is that I have no idea how Klaatu (Michael Rennie) gets out of his locked room at Walter Reed Hospital without breaking through the door or the walls. I also don't know how it's possible for an 8-foot giant robot with a head the size of a beanbag chair to walk across the city of Washington, DC, melt the wall of a government building, pick up the dead body of an alien, and carry it back across town with no one bothering to notice.

Rennie's Klaatu is not cardboard but is still a bit of a puzzle. Okay, his planet has been monitoring our transmissions for years.

I was almost immediately drawn in to this fascinating story, engrossed in the intricacies of the plot. This reminded me of Gosford Park, in that there is a lot of food for thought here. Emma Thompson is excellent, as is Anthony Hopkins. What fine performances from both of them! I had forgotten that Hugh Grant was in this. His performance was also well done, and understated. Christopher Reeve also had what amounted to a cameo; this movie was made a couple of years before his accident. It's hard to describe the plot, as there is so much going on. Hopkins plays a butler; his goal is to be the finest butler he can be, and one of the best qualities a butler can have is loyalty. Yet, he slowly (very very slowly) realizes that perhaps loyalty, when displaced, is not actually a virtue. Thompson plays the young housekeeper who is very good at what she does, yet she is (by the character's own admission) a coward. The main storyline concerns the butler's unrequited love for the housekeeper, and it is heartbreaking! This is not a film that everyone will enjoy, but the subtleties made it one that I'll most definitely watch again. I highly recommend it, with the caveat that if you'd rather watch an action picture, this won't be for you.
