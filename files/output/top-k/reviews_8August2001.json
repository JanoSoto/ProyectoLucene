I could see from the trailer that this second movie would have a different feel to the original (the first being more of a psychological thriller), but still it caught me totally off-guard. I Still Know... took a brave step away from the feel of its predecessor, and dared to be different - which is most probably why so many people disliked it. The opening scene displays a similar amount of emotion and tension that was visible ten minutes into the first movie, but then, in Love Hewitt's own words, the movie goes crazy. In a good way...British-born Danny Cannon's directing is top-notch, and his build up of atmosphere and suspense throughout the movie is well-paced. His style and obvious knowledge of Horror movies (as with the original) is a great benefit, and there are quite a few 'jumps' that work well.With Williamson unwilling to return to script a sequel, my main fear was that the script would be appalling if written by a newcomer. Thankfully, Trey Callaway's script is both inventive and witty, and matches Williamson's style almost seamlessly. Although the characters are not quite as well developed, we are given enough interesting and chilling set pieces to keep things at an entertaining level.The setting of the deserted tropical island is an inspired idea, and the isolation of the central characters adds much-needed suspense. This smart move helps to bring a new sense of unease and isolation to the film. By now, the overall feeling of unease apparent in the first has dissipated, but the atmosphere of the island is overpowering and the suspense almost unbearable as Ben creeps ever closer to conquering Julie.Another good point - as with the first I Know... - is that all the characters are genuine and likeable. While they are a little under-developed, what we do see of them helps the viewer to understand and like them. Between Karla's happy-go-lucky attitude, and bar-maid Nancy's dark sense of humor there is something quite special here. The acting is again of a high standard, and I was surprised at how well Brandy made the jump from TV comedy to full-fledged movie horror! Even supporting actors such as Matthew Settle (who played Will Benson) and Jennifer Esposito were extremely enjoyable, giving this movie a sense of realism that isn't all too apparent in many movies these days. The presence of Ben Willis is one that still sends chills down the spine, and Muse Watson's portrayal of a cold-blooded killer is unlike any other on-screen slasher in this day and age. Another welcome face (and one that spiced up the movie a little with his pompous hotel manager) is Jeffrey Combs, who is brilliant as the tight-lipped manager, and his death is a truly memorable and shocking moment (his subdued Duh! still cracks me up).The only disappointing thing about I Still Know... is the final epilogue scene. While the final shock worked effectively in the first movie and gave a great final scare, here it is rather predictable. Although it is handled well, and Love's final scream is one that is chilling to the extreme, it simply leaves the movie feeling unfinished.MY VERDICT A worthy sequel that is given way too little credit for trying to be different. While it may not suit everybody's taste, the great performances from all the principle cast (in particular Love Hewitt, who it was great to see back!), an original setting and artistic directing set this one above most teen slashers, and is one that should not be viewed alone on a dark night.

Everyone always criticizes DiCaprio's performance in almost every movie that he makes. Well, I absolutely adore him. 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape', 'Basketball Diaries', 'Titanic' and yes, 'The Beach' all show him acting out his best. In my opinion, DiCaprio is one of the most talented actors around. Argue with me but I really think he does his best in almost every role. Once again, HE didn't let me down, but this movie sure did. The first part (not the entire first half) was decent and it looked like 'The Beach' could make a name for itself. The plot started to carry on with little meaning and that's where I got bored with it. Although the beginning narration started off slow, it also started out with nice scenery and a good script trying to break through. Three characters hit the island and then the film started to pick up. We skip ahead to where Richard starts eating bugs, he turns into a video game character and starts hissing like a cat. Okay, that's enough. 'The Beach' was kind of lost from then on. We skip ahead some more to the ending, and like the beginning, it too was slow. In fact, it was a terrible ending. The script itself could have been good, I'm not saying great, but good for the most part. It went in one direction while what the characters were doing and saying went into another. It seemed as if the whole thing started to lose meaning at one point or another.The acting was very good. I already gave my opinion on DiCaprio's half, so let me talk about the rest of the cast. Virginie Ledoyen who plays Françoise, was just alright. Her character wasn't really given a lot of attention to but what she was given, she handled well. I really liked the man who played Françoise's boyfriend, Étienne I think. He too didn't contribute a whole lot to the plot but I thought that he was a good actor. I did not like how his character just disappeared about half way through the film. Why did they do that? Keep him around. I  won't comment too much on Tilda Swinton (Sal) except to say that she is one of the most annoying actresses I have ever seen. Little tip 're-cast.' Everyone else did good.One of the worst things about this film was the narration. Richard telling the story through his eyes started to get boring. The part where he's out in the woods, keeping an eye on those four travelers is when it hit me the most. For ten or so minutes, he does nothing but narrate and we really don't see too much action. Another thing that seemed to irritate me was those darn flashbacks to Daffy in his room. There he is firing away at the tourists with Richard screaming beside him. Oh, that was one of the terrible parts.This movie had beautiful scenery, a decent script (that got screwed up some how) and so-so special effects.

My next greatest disappointment was that this movie left me wanting more.  There just wasn't enough time to fully develop the full potential of this storyline.  The more I think about the good parts made me feel that there could, nay should, have been more.The best part of the movie was the return of Dr. Alan Grant.  I was disappointed with the second instalment because only Ian Malcolm returned (don't get me wrong, I did enjoy Jeff Goldblum's performance, but he just wasn't the chaotician he was in the first instalment).  Kudos to Sam Neill for a bang-up performance.The special effects were awesome, and the new look for the raptors was cool.  The brief but impressive battle between the big dinosaur and the T-Rex was cool; I only wished that it lasted longer with greater detail.The only thing is that this movie should have been longer.  In that extra span of time, they (Grant and Billy) should have been briefly discussing why the appearances of the raptors changed and about how this new dinosaur came to be, one that was not included on Ingen's list.  Mutant aberrations?  Too much in-breeding?  Something to do with amphibian DNA?  It would have been nice to hear their take on it, but if they need to cut costs, why not cut out scientific discussions.Although its only been my first viewing of the movie, it seemed as though Grant and Billy were unable to catalogue the dinosaur with the spines.  There were a few guesses, but Grant dismissed them.This movie left me asking the question, Why?I do not claim to be a dinosaur expert, but I have to ask  with so many large herbivores (which may not be quite right to begin with considering the number of carnivores in such a small area), how is it that everything is so lush and green?  According to the informational documentary Walking with Dinosaurs, such herbivores take many years to grow (providing that they survive), and they eat continuously throughout the day, and even knock over the trees to the ground if they have to.Another question (although they did not dwell on it much in the movie) would be (and I hate to do this, but)...***SPOILER ALERT***  ***SPOILER ALERT***  ***SPOILER ALERT*** ...how is it that a kid at the age of 15 could survive in a land infested with carnivores for eight weeks?  Not only that, but he was hiding at the Site B compound, right smack in the middle of, if memory serves me, raptor territory.  Reading Grant's two books and Malcolm's book would not prepare anyone for the vigours of surviving a prehistoric world.  They just referred to the kid as being resourceful.  Great.  That explains everything.  He should have been a dino treat within a few days.I have other such (or similar) questions, but I will no longer bore you.  I just have a (bad) habit of over-analysing movies I really like.  In a few days, it will all be a distant memory.Despite how I feel about the negative aspects of the movie, the action and suspense were enough to cancel them out and more.

In this regards Planet of the Apes 2001 is no different, however once again Tim Burton reminds us how wide the imagination can spread.If your like me and are generally unsatisfied with the tripe peddled to the masses in modern day supermarket cinemas then you'll understand my pleasure when a Tim Burton movie comes out.

The first feeling I had when leaving the cinema was I need to see that again.

That is up until the conflict sequences towards the end. Sometimes I wonder if they change writers in these films but the person who thought hard about the script suddenly stopped thinking about it and the movie seemed to suddenly lower a level or two.

Although one must remember this is a film about Apes, and what Apes they are!These walking talking Apes are absolutely fantastic. Unlike the original they all look very different to each other and they actually act like Apes. If you have ever been to the Zoo and Watched the monkeys play you'll know what I mean. Tim Roth was absolutely outstanding and totally convincing as the evil Ape, I was completely in awe of how convincing his character and monkey suit was. Not only was the make-up outstanding but they also must of studied how Apes behave because they had the personalities and behaviour habits down to a fine art! Watching Them hang from the sealing, leap from tree to tree and go berserk was an absolute riot and I enjoyed every minute of it!The humans and the hero on the other hand are a slightly different story! They are obviously not the focus of the film so there are no strong performances, certainly they do not get much screen time. As for Mark Whalberg as Leo he is probably the first true to life hero. There is absolutely nothing special about his character and in the end he does nothing special either except give hope to the humans on this upside down world. He is not an over the top action hero, he is more of a nineties man with no special traits except his inability to accept Ape control. But we all would object I believe. This is what I liked about Leo, he was ordinary and even when he was trying to motivate the humans at the end no one fell into the trap of an over the top inspirational speech. he sounded like you or I would making it up on the spot.

In the year 2029, astronaut Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) travels through a storm in space and is separated from his comrades. He lands on a remote planet, where humans are slaves and the apes are rulers. He is captured but attempts to escape and tries to revolt against the apes. You might think that a new version of Planet of the Apes from 1968 would be a bad idea. But since the story in the new one is rather different than in the original, it becomes a whole new film. Burton´s version comes up with many interesting ideas. He develops the racial issues more than the first one did, and questions the real differences between the humans and the apes.The acting is first class all the way, Mark Wahlberg is perfect in the leading role, but the real stars here are those who play apes. Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan and Tim Roth are all excellent, especially the latter. Roth is terrific as the evil General Thade, a character whom in the wrong hands could have been a bit silly. But Roth makes him a great villain, and he actually steals the show. I would love to see this British actor in more big budget productions in the future. The acting through the very realistic ape costumes is definitely something worth seeing.Overall, I liked the new Planet of the Apes better than the first one, and I still liked that one a lot. But the new one has better actors, cooler effects and a clever and entertaining script. It´s not perfect, the movie becomes a bit sentimental and cheesy towards the end, when Wahlberg tries to motivate the humans to fight. And why does it always have to be a kid who wants to be a hero in these big summer movies? I first thought that it was only in the Jurassic Park-trilogy that this was common, but Planet of the Apes was no exception.  This is still the most exciting adventure I´ve seen this year, and it´s nice to see a summer movie with both brains and muscles.

Sure, you could spend loads of quality time reviewing the clasics from Hitchcock to Scorsese; but lets follow suit for the modern generation and study half-heartedly.Where to begin, I suppose one could look at the film as simply a story, perhaps even docudrama which focuses on the late 1970's porn industry-and what an industry it was!  The other half could focus on the incredible detail one brillant filmmaker can achieve simply by using polyester and *ahem* rubber.  But honestly, Boogie Nights brings back the pure, no-bul!shi$, in your face kind of cinema I haven't experienced since the film greats of the 1970's...ironic...or stroke of genius.  The story is full of richly detailed characters, all of which you either can relate too, love, or hate; but the impact is clear-you are feeling something for them.  Among the characters the two performances which stand out are Burt Reynolds as Director Jack Horner, and Mark Wahlberg as Eddie Adams\/Dirk Diggler. Julianne Moore is also brillant, as is Heather Graham...but if I focus on any one actor it would have to be John C. Reilly.  John's performance is a perfect balance of comedic timing and character driven emotion...I'm a sucker for the line Ever see the movie Star Wars?...People say I look like Han Solo.  Anyway, the look of the film is incredible, the Director of Photography and Director\/Writer\/Producer, have come up with a vibrant colour, and flashy style that compares to Martin Scorsese, and Stanley Kubrick(in terms of his perfection of his craft); but with creating his own unique look, and pushing the edge with the longest single shot I'ver ever seen...that being the New Year's party sequence.The music, like in any great film, is a character of its own.  At times, it consumes oneself with sorrow or grief...but mainly its all about fun, dancing, and having a good time; the spirit of the 1970's. OK, back to the performances.Burt Reynolds plays the character of Jack Horner, a porn director who feels the burden of what the future of film means to his genre.  The awful transition from shooting on film to recording on magnetic tape. The lose of his art, as it were...and the changes in mentality to the people he works with.  Walhberg adds the perfect blend of innocense and sexual bravado needed for the character.

Heather Graham is the eye-candy, but later holds her own, and steals some of the scenes from even the great Mr. Reynolds himself.  Each character is multidimensional, rich with life, and performed by actors that seem to be picture perfect for the part.The film itself is often funny, tragic, exciting, and provides a uncompromising look into the turblulant lifestyle of the fast-pace 1970's.

Anyway, the look of the film is incredible, the Director of Photography and Director\/Writer\/Producer, have come up with a vibrant colour, and flashy style that compares to Martin Scorsese, and Stanley Kubrick(in terms of his perfection of his craft); but with creating his own unique look, and pushing the edge with the longest single shot I'ver ever seen...that being the New Year's party sequence.The music, like in any great film, is a character of its own.  At times, it consumes oneself with sorrow or grief...but mainly its all about fun, dancing, and having a good time; the spirit of the 1970's. OK, back to the performances.Burt Reynolds plays the character of Jack Horner, a porn director who feels the burden of what the future of film means to his genre.  The awful transition from shooting on film to recording on magnetic tape. The lose of his art, as it were...and the changes in mentality to the people he works with.  Walhberg adds the perfect blend of innocense and sexual bravado needed for the character.  For all those individuals who have seen Burton's Planet of the Apes, pay no attention to the performance of Wahlberg in that film...rent boogie nights and see what a difference a good script can make!Julianne Moore plays the would-be mother to all, and with that comes the torment and anguish she feels, as life imitates art; and she loses all those close to her.  Heather Graham is the eye-candy, but later holds her own, and steals some of the scenes from even the great Mr. Reynolds himself.  Each character is multidimensional, rich with life, and performed by actors that seem to be picture perfect for the part.The film itself is often funny, tragic, exciting, and provides a uncompromising look into the turblulant lifestyle of the fast-pace 1970's. It makes no excuses, and tells no lies; and offers the audience a trip back. But even more importantly, the movie gives us a grand example of how films should be made; and a new director whose bold visions bring back art in film.

And though this may be the least scientifically accurate one, it is still a great, short blast of fun.Following the legendary Jurassic Park and the critically panned The Lost World Jurasssic Park (my personal favorite in the series), Joe Johnston directs this short, quickly paced, and very fun dinosaur movie.  With an okay premise, simple and understandable characters, and the always excellent presence of Sam Neil and William H. Macy, Johnston directs the movie like a good old fashioned Ray Harryhausen film.The story takes place after Isla Sorna (Site B) has been made public, and the world knows dinosaurs are now alive and well.  And of course, like anything interesting and extremely dangerous, stupid tourists want to see them!  Such is the case when the son (Trevor Morgan) of a divorced couple (Macy and Tea Leoni) goes sailing around Isla Nublar with his mom's new boyfriend.  Naturally, as is the case of anyone going near dinosaurs or trying to videotape Godzilla, they end up getting stranded on the island. Talk about bang for your buck.Enter Alan Grant.  Still digging in the hot Bad Lands for fossils, he's strapped for grant money.  So Macy and Leoni ask him to be a tour guide while they fly over Site B, never mentioning their true intentions of landing and looking for their son.So, despite the best of common sense from Grant, the plane lands, is attacked, and you've got a few really unlucky people on the worst place in the world.The film moves quickly, and is about 20-30 minutes shorter than the previous two.  I preffered the more dramatic aspects of the series, but I loved the atmosphere of quick adventure and fun this movie brings.  It works in a Ray Harryhausen kind of way.As a dinosaur enthusiast, I'm also glad to see more dinosaurs (though I still love T-Rex more than anything but Allosaurus).  We get Pteranodons (NOT pterodactyls!), a quick cameo of what I'm pretty sure is a Ceratasaurus, and the well hyped Spinosaurus.The scenes with these dinosaurs are excellent (even though the Ceratosaurus bit is really just a joke).  The Pteranodons attack, the Spinosaurus's introduction and finale, all are very tense and executed well on screen.However, there are, naturally, some setbacks.  And if any of you say plot holes and characterization, go watch American Beauty.  This is a dinosaur action movie damnit, not a serious drama!The main problem for me is that the suspense is somewhat killed when a 40 foot long dinosaur can't catch up to a group of mindlessly scrabbling humans.  That's what, among other things, I loved about the Lost World lots more dinosaur food.  They manage to stay far ahead of the Spinosaurus (except on water), and it loses its thrill.  Luckily, this doesn't happen in any scene with the pteranodons and the velociraptors.Which, however, is another problem.  Although the T-Rex is traded in for the Spinosaurus, the velociraptors are abundent, which is the problem.  We've seen plenty of the velociraptors in the previous two, and trying to make them more intelligent and altering their looks for this outing just doesn't cut it.  I would suggest more of the aforemention ceratosaurus.But my big complaints is really just nit-picking scientific details, so its nothing big.  The fact is that this movie is really quite less acurate to common theories on dinosaurs than the previous two.  For one thing, i doubt a Pteranodon would go after something so large as a human when its mouth is designed to catch fish, or feed an healthy teenager to its young.And for the hyped up Spino vs. T-Rex fight, the Rex would've one easily. While the Spino is bigger than the Rex, its only by about 4 feet in length. And while the Spino did have a longer head and bigger hands, it was much more lightly built than a Rex or even an allosaurus.  Its teeth weren't designed for taking down large, struggling prey, its jaws were weakers, and the Spinosaurus's trademark spine is a giant weakness.  It would have been easily damaged during a fight with any large prey.  The Rex was more muscular, had teeth and a jaw designed to crush bone, binocular vision, excellent sense of smell, and a brain twice the size of the Spinosaurs, Acrocanthosaurus, or Giganotasaurus.  Spino was just there because it looked cool.Still, the fight was cool, but not up to anything Ray Harryhausen has done.Overall, this is a well, but not excellently, made diosaur action movie. And just the words Dinosaur Movie make me want to see it again.  I'd give it 3 1\/2 out of 5 stars.

There are also a few other rooms that characters move in and out of.  How much did this cost?  Like $50?  And because the set is so cheap, it feels like the characters never really move anywhere.

I have always thought his goal in doing this was to rip the audience out of their preconceptions of how a movie should work so they could see his films for what they were.  As for people that complain about this film being boring, slow, or obtuse; well, they should watch other movies.  But please, use the vitriol sparingly!  Many don't like Shakespeare, Van Gogh, Rachmaninoff, and e. e. cummings, but that doesn't mean they suck or produced crap.  I love this movie because of its determination to tell its own story in its own way, without regard for convention, which is awfully nice for a change.  And to those who give up on this one after one viewing (especially if the one viewing is on video!), I can only encourage you to give it another try, and this time throw out your images of Star Wars and The Matrix and Planet of the Apes (all fine films) and give 2001 the attention it deserves.  And if you still don't like it, then that's cool too.  I like all kinds of movies, but this is the one that convinced me that movies were for grownups too, and that film is an art form that occasionally admits a view of genius.  I think I'll go watch it right now!
