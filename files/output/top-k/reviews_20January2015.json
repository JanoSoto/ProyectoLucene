Most of them surprisingly by Yoshiaki Kawajiri. I then found some video on YouTube about Akira and the style caught my eye. Looking into it and it's place in anime history I decided to watch it... then I found out it is an adaptation of a very long manga. Having not read the manga, a few things are lost in translation.So after a blast of some kind destroys Tokyo, 30 years after World War 3 a new Tokyo is built. Kaneda, the leader of a motorcycle gang basically goes out to fight a rival gang called The Clowns. Then Kaneda's friend Tetsuo almost runs over a psychic kid but doesn't due to his psychic powers. Tetsuo is taken in by the military and experimented on, when he basically gets the same psychic powers... somehow. Then he begins running amok, not being able to control the power and basically slicing through any military force to get the most powerful psychic kid outside his cryogenic pod and it's up to the military, Kaneda, his freedom fighter acquaintance and whoever else to stop him.Okay being as that this is an adaptation of a near-2000 page manga there are a lot of things left out which for a complete newcomer like me, has me straight up questioning things. For example, if there is a revolution and a fight for freedom then what else is the government doing to people other then monitoring psychic children that can reportedly (if left unchecked) nuke an entire city with their mind? Clearly the government has some kind of motivation or goal but the only hint we have at that are a few throw away lines about how corrupt they are.Not only that Tetsuo could have been handled a lot better. Actually a few of the characters needed this. Talking about Tetsuo he begins to have the power go to his head because he didn't want to be weak or something and then decides to use the power to awaken Akira because something in his mind told him to. I feel as if maybe in the source material that Tetsuo may have been a tragic villain and maybe give more focus to Kaneda being conflicted about killing his friend but here it just seems rushed.Aside from those things (and maybe a couple of other things) left unexplained there is a lot to like about this movie. For the time the animation is excellent, really not only is the movie highly stylized but the animation itself is a big step up from the.. how should I put this, cheaper animation of earlier anime. It manages to still be stunning to this day.That and while this does leave a lot out it at least can be followed if you overlook stuff like the government's goal being unexplained or Tetsuo's motivation being weak and it does this while not boiling down to exposition every couple of minutes. While some may ask well so what? this movie could have been so much worse if all it was would be exposition and action scenes.So there is something to be enjoyed in this movie. Particularly the style and the animation. I would also say there are a couple of story ideas that are really good despite them not being that explored. I may or may not read the manga but if you're just diving into it (like I almost did) then I should warn that there are things lost in translation and that is made clear from someone who hasn't read it. I still enjoyed it and would recommend it to those with a slight interest in anime.

But there are enough hints that you feel like there must be some kind of deeper meaning. However, you'll never get a definite answer. You're not meant to. Human emotions and memories just aren't like that. Arguably the universe itself isn't like that. There are always exceptions to physical laws and weird phenomena that you thought were surely impossible that are actually possible. The important thing is that you *want* the answers, that you care about the characters and the story. And here you do, I guess mainly because the characters are very human and we see everything from their point of view. We relate to their fear, confusion, lust and curiosity.David Lynch commits so strongly to his ideas that you can't just casually dismiss them. Laughter is infectious and so are visions when they're presented so earnestly. Lynch seems to believe in what he's doing so you have no choice but to go along for the ride. It's funny because most movies are full of plot holes anyway, they have so much exposition, so many unnecessary scenes. Typical plots where you can predict later developments. Screen writing that's just going through the motions. Everything is restricted to conventional reality and a linear sequence of events.For me, movies are about ideas, emotions, themes, building tension, playing with expectations, a big climax. The aim is to affect an audience, make them laugh or cry or think or remember something. I think Lynch is a painter. His movies contain images that are hard to forget, they are very stylish. Your brain takes a longer time to process them, they enter your long-term memory in contrast to ordinary films that are often fun but instantly forgettable. His movies are more surreal or abstract, an aspect of film that seems almost completely untapped.I think Patricia Arquette's role is one of the sexiest in any movie ever. She's soft and feminine and kind. She's in most of the movie. I really like the music. It's very moody and adds to the atmosphere a lot. Many of the shots are held a bit longer or shorter than what feels natural. It keeps you guessing, keeps the flow unpredictable. The acting is good, although most of the time the characters are just concerned or confused.Lost Highway is very similar to Mulhulland Drive in many ways. In particular, both movies are split almost into two separate narratives with confusingly similar characters and plots. Like two alternate realities strangely interlinked. A common interpretation seems to roughly be that one story-line is reality while the other is a dream which explains why the same themes occur and why details partially overlap. Also the tone is similar, they're dark and sometimes scary.I'm reminded of Rashomon and The Usual Suspects, where characters recount what happened and we see flashbacks but aren't sure quite how accurate they really are.

","genre":"Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"20 January 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Gary Cooper's Marshall Kane could have left town. He is already on the horse and carriage with his new wife (Grace Kelly, perhaps out of his league in age but whatever, I'm sure they have their reasons). He knows that the dastardly villain Frank Miller, who was put in jail for good reason by Kane for a crime that should've had him hanged, is out on pardon and on his way back to the town to get his revenge. He knows the town would be in danger from him and his posse (including the likes of Lee van Cleef!) But... something's not right about running away. He could, but where would it get anyone? Miller would still continue to terrorize the people, and would likely come after him someway or somehow. No, this won't do - so he returns, and tries to gather up some deputies. Not only can he find practically no one to be at his side, people actively tell him he's wrong for a number or reasons. High Noon was made without ambiguity as an allegory for the period, namely for Hollywood writers and creators and actors who has to be put up against the BS HUAC and without many to help them in the Communist inquests. Who can you seek help with when fear comes up around everyone? What makes High Noon last though, why it's been homaged and parodied and remake over the years, is because, like with another 1950's parable genre film, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, it could apply to a lot of things in this world. Teamwork, adversity, ignorance, cowardice, themes and dramatic conflicts presented in High Noon don't just have the time and place of the Communist paranoia, otherwise, frankly, the film would be dated. This is what John Wayne couldn't get through his thick skull when he went on to attack the film (the one good thing to come out was his response with Howard Hawks, Rio Bravo). Or, as it was speculated according to IMDb trivia, he secretly wanted the role of Kane for himself - and might've made it, also frankly, more unrealistic.Cooper is world-weary but keeps pressing on, loaded with sweat, the Tomkin sung song traveling with him like he's Radio Raheem with 'Fight the Power' in Do the Right Thing. He just needs a few good deputies, and yet everyone tells him he's wrong, nuts, foolish, or maybe just the situation itself is just too much - a little more time, not just the hour and change as the minutes keep ticking till the noon train arrives, things could be different - and this conflict of getting people and others telling Kane to just stop and run away, this makes for wonderful tension. There's probably a reason this is called the western for people who don't like Westerns', because it could be about any time replace the Miller- led gunslingers with gangsters and it could be set in the 1930's; change it to ronin and you get... Seven Samurai, to a degree, if they couldn't get the 'Seven' that is. There are a couple of things for me that keep it from being really a full-blown 'classic', at least on first viewing. I didn't fully buy the performance from the Mexican woman and character, Katy Jurado. She's not bad, but something about her is kind of stiff and one- note. Grace Kelly, at first, seemed that way too, but the more I understood her character as the loving Quaker wife with good intentions but a sharp mind and instincts, I liked her a lot more. One or two minor supporting turns from the cast also stick out, but perhaps they'll grow on me over time when I return to the film. Certainly Lloyd Bridges is excellent, giving his scenes an intensity as he is burning with conflict - the deputy who has been in town for so long and is finally giving up, but should he? And should he get into a fight with the momentarily- doubtful Kane as he's in the horse stable? That fight alone is worth the 'price of admission' as they say.Zinneman may be using symbols, via Kramer's production ethos, but they didn't come off as heavy-handed for me. What is so striking is just how compacted everything is, and how Cooper makes this a performance about stress and being a hero who may very well be reluctant and tired and 'what the hell am I DOING doing this?'

He is already on the horse and carriage with his new wife (Grace Kelly, perhaps out of his league in age but whatever, I'm sure they have their reasons). He knows that the dastardly villain Frank Miller, who was put in jail for good reason by Kane for a crime that should've had him hanged, is out on pardon and on his way back to the town to get his revenge. He knows the town would be in danger from him and his posse (including the likes of Lee van Cleef!) But... something's not right about running away. He could, but where would it get anyone? Miller would still continue to terrorize the people, and would likely come after him someway or somehow. No, this won't do - so he returns, and tries to gather up some deputies. Not only can he find practically no one to be at his side, people actively tell him he's wrong for a number or reasons. High Noon was made without ambiguity as an allegory for the period, namely for Hollywood writers and creators and actors who has to be put up against the BS HUAC and without many to help them in the Communist inquests. Who can you seek help with when fear comes up around everyone? What makes High Noon last though, why it's been homaged and parodied and remake over the years, is because, like with another 1950's parable genre film, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, it could apply to a lot of things in this world. Teamwork, adversity, ignorance, cowardice, themes and dramatic conflicts presented in High Noon don't just have the time and place of the Communist paranoia, otherwise, frankly, the film would be dated. This is what John Wayne couldn't get through his thick skull when he went on to attack the film (the one good thing to come out was his response with Howard Hawks, Rio Bravo). Or, as it was speculated according to IMDb trivia, he secretly wanted the role of Kane for himself - and might've made it, also frankly, more unrealistic.Cooper is world-weary but keeps pressing on, loaded with sweat, the Tomkin sung song traveling with him like he's Radio Raheem with 'Fight the Power' in Do the Right Thing. He just needs a few good deputies, and yet everyone tells him he's wrong, nuts, foolish, or maybe just the situation itself is just too much - a little more time, not just the hour and change as the minutes keep ticking till the noon train arrives, things could be different - and this conflict of getting people and others telling Kane to just stop and run away, this makes for wonderful tension. There's probably a reason this is called the western for people who don't like Westerns', because it could be about any time replace the Miller- led gunslingers with gangsters and it could be set in the 1930's; change it to ronin and you get... Seven Samurai, to a degree, if they couldn't get the 'Seven' that is. There are a couple of things for me that keep it from being really a full-blown 'classic', at least on first viewing. I didn't fully buy the performance from the Mexican woman and character, Katy Jurado. She's not bad, but something about her is kind of stiff and one- note. Grace Kelly, at first, seemed that way too, but the more I understood her character as the loving Quaker wife with good intentions but a sharp mind and instincts, I liked her a lot more. One or two minor supporting turns from the cast also stick out, but perhaps they'll grow on me over time when I return to the film. Certainly Lloyd Bridges is excellent, giving his scenes an intensity as he is burning with conflict - the deputy who has been in town for so long and is finally giving up, but should he? And should he get into a fight with the momentarily- doubtful Kane as he's in the horse stable? That fight alone is worth the 'price of admission' as they say.Zinneman may be using symbols, via Kramer's production ethos, but they didn't come off as heavy-handed for me.

","genre":"Drama, War"},{"date":"20 January 2015","score":"","review":" Kramer vs Kramer is one of the most realistic depiction of a family being torn apart by divorce and one of the first, on film. Adapted from the novel of the same name by Avery Corman, the movie tells the story of a married couple's divorce, Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) and Joanna Kramer (Meryl Streep) and its impact on everyone involved, including the couple's young son, Billy Kramer (Justin Henry). Directed by Robert Benton, the movie reflected a cultural shift which occurred during the 1970s, when ideas about parenthood were changing. The movie serves as Hollywood's answer to many contemporary questions toward divorce. This movie forever put a great understanding about how hard it is to be divorce and raising a child. The movie is made out to be a divorce drama, but you barely get that until ¾ in the film. It's more about Hoffman's character, learning how to become a better father than an actual showdown between the two parents. This is one of the first film that portray a father in a more sensitivity type role. The father in the film takes more of an attachment style of parenting, when Joanna choose to live outside, the traditional role of being confined to some extent to an ideal mother and wife. You really enjoy the film for each scene in the movie, where Ted Kramer grows closer and closer to his son and takes his duties as his father, very serious. One of the most famous scene in the movie is the 'ice cream' scene that gets me every time. Dustin Hoffman really knew his role, and how rough divorce could be, because at the time of filming, he was going through a real life marriage separate with his first wife. Indeed, Dustin Hoffman deserve the Academy Award, Best Actor win for this film. The same goes to Meryl Streep for the supporting role. Joanna is not an easily appealing character, but Meryl Streep makes her likable. Meryl Streep at the time, was still recovering from the death of her lover, actor John Cazale from lung cancer. It's sad, that Meryl Streep is barely in the film. The scene with Meryl Streep in the courtroom was her Oscar breaking moment. No matter, how good, Ted Kramer can serve the mother role, in the end, it's hard for the child to break their maternal bond. Still, the tender years doctrine that states mothers are better parents than fathers of young children was on the wane by the late 1970s, when the film came out, thus it's unlikely a judge would still make that the sole basis of his decision. I'm really glad, that the movie gave equal weight to both parents, showing their strengths and faults. There wasn't a lot of mean-spirit arguments or fighting between them. I'm kinda glad, because it would had turn me off, from enjoying the film. It's very importance to show both Joanna and Ted's points of view, rather than one. If, they only did one, it would be, very off-putting. The movie even made me, like Justin Henry as Billy Kramer. He deserve his nomination. Unlike, many other child actors, at the time, he wasn't annoying or seem inexperienced in his acting chops. He played the role in a very maturely for a child, his young age. It is also superbly acted by its supporting cast, including Jane Alexander, Howard Duff, and George Coe. The movie also make great use of classical music like Vivaldi's Concerto in C major for mandolin and strings and Henry Purcell's work. It appears over the opening credits and throughout the film. It was a joy to listen to. Made in 1979, the movie is a little dated. The story lacks substance compare to today's soap-operas. Its rating is bit questionable. The movie is rated PG, but the movie has some foul language, drug use and nudity that puzzling to see in a PG film. I guess, 1979 was a little more open, than parents of this generation. It's more PG-13, these days. It really up to the parent if they really want to show this movie to their children. I do think, children do need to understand what divorce is all about and this movie still is one of the best films that cover that issue. It has a positive message that encourages sensitivity, understanding, responsibility, and tenderness in child-parent relationships. The film gives good examples of positive ways of dealing with anger, fear and disappointment. No wonder, why this film won Best Picture at the Academy Awards in 1980. Overall It's a very thoughtful film. I'm glad, that I watch it. I believe kids and parents who've been through divorce will find much that is relatable and if a movie can help people dealt with it. Then I think it's a good movie. I recommended it.

Overall It's a very thoughtful film. I'm glad, that I watch it. I believe kids and parents who've been through divorce will find much that is relatable and if a movie can help people dealt with it. Then I think it's a good movie. I recommended it.

I had already seen the previous Westerns by Sergio Leone, and was especially awed by The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1966), so I looked forward to Once Upon a Time in the West with great anticipation. I was disappointed. On the one hand, I could see that it had a lot of good stuff in it, but there was something lacking. As I found out later, what was lacking was all the footage that had been cut out of the movie for its release in America. It was not until the movie came to television, and I saw much of the additional material (with some stuff edited out for the usual reasons), that I realized what a great movie it was. Even then it was not until somewhat later that I saw the restoration, which included even more material. Unfortunately, those who restored this movie messed up on the music at the end, which is hard to understand, because it would have been simple to do it right. I guess we Americans just were not destined to see this movie in its perfect form, and certainly not in a movie theater (at least not where I live).On the whole, the critics did not seem to like the movie when it first came out either. Some of them may have also reacted negatively to the chopped up presentation, but others were offended by other things, such as the slow pace or the amoral characters. Some of the critics objected to the way it copied stuff from other Westerns. What they (and I) did not realize at the time was that these were quotations, not necessarily in the sense of quoting what had been said in other Westerns, but in the extended sense of creating images and plot points similar to those in previous Westerns. Presumably, Leone had intended that people would watch his movie and smile appreciatively at these quotations, and I suppose some people did precisely that. What he probably did not realize was that these quotations were more likely to be appreciated in reverse, as was the case with me. I had seen many of the Westerns that were quoted, but only once, and thus did not catch the references. Once Upon a Time in the West, however, I watched every chance I got, and I quit counting after I had seen it twenty-five times.Little by little, I watched the classic Westerns again, or for the first time in many cases, and I would experience déjà vu. For example, one night I was watching The Plainsman (1936), somewhat listlessly, when suddenly, toward the end of the movie I felt a ripple of exhilaration go through me. At first, I did not know why, but I quickly realized that when Gary Cooper dressed up in black and entered the bar, he looked just like Frank entering the bar to buy the land back from Harmonica.From then on I never knew when I would catch another quotation and get another feeling of déjà vu, as I did when I watched High Noon (1952), Johnny Guitar (1954), The Searchers (1956), Shane (1953), 310 to Yuma (1957), Warlock (1959), and many others. Those are fairly obvious, but others can easily escape notice, as in the case of the little piece of material missing from the brim of Harmonica's hat, just like the hat Charles Bronson wore in The Magnificent Seven (1960).Of course, one's ability to appreciate these reverse quotations presupposes having seen Once Upon a Time in the West many, many times. No problem. ","genre":null},{"date":"20 January 2015","score":"","review":" I was in college when this movie came out.

There's too much talk about the different parties and subjects that only avid news watchers would like. In The Line Of Fire is about battling a hit-man. The political bit don't get in the way at all. Since there's many subplots about the characters that tie together very well, the strength makes it outweigh most other flicks like this. To top it all off, Wolfgang Peterson gives us a picture with a direction that only the best can do. Any perilous thriller like this is a sure winner, but Peterson does more. He treats Malkovich's character like an actual monster. Similar to what John Carpenter did with Michael Myers in the original Halloween, we do not really see Malcovich's character into part way through the movie.

No. That is just when they begin.

Of course, I could sit and watch nothing but classics, the stone-cold iconic movies that have stood the test of time and remain loved by all. But then I'd be missing perspective and let's be honest, not every movie is a classic. There are those that make you question why you bother going to the pictures at all or inspire you to become an actor or director - not because you're good but because you can't possibly be as bad as those you've just seen. As a fairly prolific writer, I do have to dip my toes into the murky waters of Turkeyville but this bizarre sci-fi western comedy felt like a baptism of bilge. It was so focused on its unusual steam-punk take on the old TV series that it completely forgot to add humour, tension, excitement, chemistry or entertainment. You know things have gone wrong when Will Smith's dire Wild Wild West track is the best thing about a movie.Sharp-shootin' ladies man James West (Smith) is forced by President Ulysses S. Grant (Kevin Kline) to investigate the disappearance of several eminent scientists after things come to a head, literally, when one turns up decapitated. Unwillingly teamed up with inventive US Marshal Artemus Gordon (Kline again), West and Gordon track down their chief suspect - former Confederate General Bloodbath McGrath (Ted Levine). But McGrath is only the muscle for the suave, wheelchair-bound Dr Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh) who has plans for the US almost as big as his secret weapon the scientists have been forced to create for him...Wild Wild West is such a monumental failure that it's hard to know where to begin. Aside from Levine, the cast are universally dreadful - Kline & West are an awful couple on screen with zero chemistry while Salma Hayek, as the obligatory love interest, is a shadow of her sultry self. Branagh is probably the most embarrassed he's ever been, spending the whole film on his digitally-removed knees and overacting with a dodgy accent and even dodgier facial hair. The plot is utter nonsense, dispensing with any sense of reality from the first shot and getting worse as the movie goes on. I'd given up on the film when Kline blasts past the horse-riding Smith on a jet-powered penny-farthing bicycle. But the film is filled with insane contraptions such as the enormous mechanical spider, the train with more toys than Inspector Gadget and Kline's ridiculous pop-up notebook and pencil. I might have got on-board with the madness if the script made me care but it didn't. The jokes fell flatter than a Russian satellite (and the constant racial gags felt forced and uncomfortable) and at no point did I care what was happening, mainly because it was obviously written by a bunch of people on extremely strong medication.The only comfort I can take from this is the brief shot of Hayek's behind and the knowledge that movies are unlikely to get worse than this for the remainder of the year. Levine's performance also deserved better than this mess but overall, Wild Wild West misfires like a broken Gatling gun. It's all concept and no execution - even the CG effects look cheap and poorly done. The film-makers may as well have got the budget (an estimated $170 million), set fire to the money and filmed that instead. It should never have got past the planning stage but since Will Smith was in the middle of his cultural assault on the Nineties at the time, I suspect it was rushed through without giving it much more thought than necessary. This was a bad judgement on the producer's part - the movie more or less halted Smith's previously unassailable success by shooting it right between the eyes and marked the start of his career decline. The arrogance of youth can be forgiven for many things but inflicting Wild Wild West on us is a crime that should come with some serious jail time.

This is all about rowdy roddy piper, gun fights, a long pointless fight (it is only around 5 minutes but it felt longer) and a woman with creepy eyes. Oh and what a fight! This is one of the highlights of the movie. It was like watching a real wrestling match. I guess maybe Keith David was given some sort of training briefly before getting into this. It was a little hilarious because they were beating each other to death for no reason almost. This is a remarkable 80s moment in my opinion. The lines are so funny! Apart from the obvious choices (bubble gum line), there are so many underrated lines which I loved so much. For a guy who doesn't have much experience in acting, his dialogue delivery is actually pretty awesome! And Keith David is also pretty good in this one. I have never seen Meg foster in any movie and frankly she scares me with her creepy eyes.The ending is a nice touch to complete this fun film in a funny way. I loved it 9\/10 ","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"20 January 2015","score":"","review":" What an actor Jack Nicholson is, of course we already know that. Unlike previous films he's been in, he plays a very interesting character that goes from unlikeable to likable, and only Nicholson can deliver a mixture of nastiness, and yet kind. Although Nicholson gives a stellar performance, he's not alone. Helen Hunt, Greg Kinnear, and the role that began his career for Cuba Gooding Jr., also give off great performances. It is a film any movie fan or critic should watch. However keep this away from small children due to the fact it has nudity and profanity which they should avoid. But for the mature audience, have at it. Because this dramedy is as good as it gets.

Tapping Rod Serling to write the screenplay was a stroke of genius from boxing (REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT) to Big Business (PATTERNS) to Fantasy (THE TWILIGHT ZONE) to down-to-Earth bona fide science fiction (PLANET OF THE APES), Serling was more than capable of spinning a yarn in cinematic terms, regardless of Genre. The complicity of the Media (Television in particular) and Big Business to overthrow the U.$. Government (i.e.; government of, by, and FOR The People) is highlighted in SEVEN DAYS IN MAY- exactly as it's come to pass. Says Senator Clark (Edmond O'Brien) in the movie This country will probably live as if peace were just as big a threat as war. How's THAT for prescient? This one must be Deep and Dark, Lancaster tells an aide. Is it just me, or is that almost word-for-word what we heard going into Iraq the second time...? We've all got to stay on alert these days, Whit Bissell advises, prefiguring the on-going, never ending War on Terror. But it's Hugh Marlowe as the televangelist newscaster who sums it all up best when he says I'm not a lover of Communists, Socialists, or intellectual bleeding hearts. I have only one interest, and that is symbolized by the red, white and blue of our glorious flag. The camera then lingers lovingly on the faces of the fanatical followers of Lancaster before he takes the stage and promptly declares his love for the Motherland. Shades of the Nuremberg rallies. When Martin Balsam's plane crashes, one can't help but be reminded of the documentary CONFESSIONS OF AN ECONOMIC Hit-man, in which just this kind of accident is detailed. March as The Pre$ident challenges Lancaster to beat him at the ballot box. You don't steal it after midnight when the country has its back turned. The Real World parallels are obvious. The Great Disregard with which The Man (Obama, not James Earl Jones) has been treated since being elected speaks for itself.
