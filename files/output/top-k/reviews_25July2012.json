Which is why I can never really say that I know that person, sure I might see them on the silver screen or an interview or two but I've never shared dinner with them nor hung out, so I honestly don't really know them.Perfect Blue is I feel one of the best if forgotten anime. This film was the late great Satoshi Kon's debut in the anime world and it's a great start for him, this film is a beautifully crafted thriller that plays out almost like a Hichcock thriller, in those thrillers it's always about a innocent person's world turned against him\/her and they become isolated with no one they can really trust to help them.The animation in this film is great to me it's one of animes best examples because it was doing something that anime still isn't doing much of or wrongfully steering aways from which is realism and unconventionality. One of the things I love about Satoshi Kons work is he's always doing something different every time and avoids all of those anime cliché's like explosions, mecha and all the other familiar goodies I've seen one time too many, this film has none of those things here he's playing things straight out no gimmicks. Also the style and direction of this anime doesn't even feel like an anime at all but actually felt like I was watching a live action more, and it's all because of the films sense of realism, that's pretty trippy but that's the point. The music is great I like the pop songs but I mainly like the eerie dark tune we hear, which really sends chills down your spine.Satoshi's trademark has been utilizing the technique of blurring reality and fantasy together, much like with Gilliam's Brazil or Jacob's Ladder. We're literally in the main character's perspective, at time it feels like were seeing reality but then it pulls the rug from under us and we then rethink about our earlier perception. Like for example that TV show Mimi is in, the case their working on is very ironic to the situation Mimi is in, in those scenes at time I couldn't help but wonder if the show wasn't actually a show but that was the reality and Mimi's acting career is the illusion. There are many other moments that can really mess with you but I wont' give them away you have to experience it yourself. Thsi makes the film all the more intense especially that revolving subplot which adds to the atmosphere with the crazed fan whom conducts a rather creep website called Mimi's Room which is a site that gives away details of her everyday life, some actually ring true to Mimi's psyche. In a way this really hits home because this is a real issue and fear that most celebrates have where there are those fans who's elevator's really don't go all the way to the top and they take it way too far; these are people that live As if lifestyles where they feel there lives are so empty they have to disconnect with reality and make it based on admiration of something else in order to fill that hole, these kinds of fans creep the hell out of me.The film those is also a character drama where we see Mimi and can't help but feel a sense of pathos for her. The whole film is mainly about identity and the subconscious fear of losing it as one changes. Mimi we see is a young, sweet, naive, vibrant person who as we see like any player in the entertainment game desires to go further and become a big name. But as we see further in the film things aren't going the way she wants them to, like the fact that she has to do things she doesn't want to do or ever is limited to others, this is a common things with all actors and actresses there are highs but there are also lows that can severely hurt, times like that really make me a little concerned for them and wonder if their really alright but also actors and actresses out of the lime light. We even see at times whether she wants to admit it or not that the band she's broken up with she actually does miss it when she sees when she's separated they've became more popular than before as well as her friendship with the two, this makes her wonder if being an actress is what she really wanted at all or was she deluding herself to run away from who she really is. With these factors as well as the subplot involved she begins to feel the pressure and fall into a spiral state of despair and depression where she begins to lose her sense of self and nothing feels real.Illusions can't hurt you but reality can kill you if you can't decipher the difference between the two and yourself.Rating 4 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"25 July 2012","score":"","review":" I always found the fundamental problem with admiration of celebrities as well as the concept of fame itself is that we tend to fail to see them for who they really are as a person.

The 1999 film Boys Don't Cry is the dramatization of Teena's story. Hilary Swank plays Teena\/Brandon, the transgender person who prefers living as a man, despite the fact she was born biologically female. Her story takes place in and around Lincoln, Nebraska, a very rural area where locals don't take too kindly to something so foreign to them like transgender people. Teena\/Brandon knows this so she hides the fact she is female while running around causing trouble with a group of alcoholic ruffians. But when she falls in love for Lana, one of the people she stays with outside of Lincoln, things get very complicated and the story darkens quite a bit in this brutally honest and disturbingly real film that is hauntingly sick from start to finish.You have to go into Boys Don't Cry prepared for a lot of drama, a lot of emotion, and a lot of brutality that will both shock and disgust you. This is a vulgar, disturbing, and obscene film that will haunt your dreams and make you look at the world in a whole new way. Of course, the vulgarity and obscenity I'm referring to has nothing to do with the protagonists sexuality. What is so shocking and so disturbing about this film is how our protagonist must live her life and the disgusting bigotry and hatred she must face.

These points force you to accept more, demand that you refine senses and notions. Mann was really up to it, and still is, despite vocal opposition. There are few American filmmakers as devoted as he is, to a visual language and sensory experience.But, I wonder if this wasn't consumed at the time as just a gripping investigation into senseless evil, perhaps a bit weird. Did it register at all as something quite deep and novel?

","genre":"Crime, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"25 July 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" ¨I love the smell of napalm in the morning.¨There is no doubt that Apocalypse Now will be considered by many as one of the best films of all time because it is a very memorable and unique film. It feels surreal at times and has some great performances. It's also hard to define what genre the film belongs to because it doesn't seem to have a structure or a pattern we find in other films. Apocalypse Now is a classic and powerful film, but I really wasn't blown away by it and didn't enjoy it very much. The problem I had with it was that I watched the Redux version which is almost one hour longer than the original, so there were several moments that seemed to drag forever. What I did enjoy about this movie was the first hour which I felt was an absolute masterpiece. Those first sixty minutes were a lot of fun and had the best moments in the movie. Then the next two hours dragged way too much with all the surrealism. I got the point, the soldiers were getting crazy over the minute and the film succeeds tremendously in pointing that out as we see how nonsensical this war really was. The minds of these men seemed to be lost completely and there was chaos reigning all over the place. For me nothing will replace those brilliant first sixty minutes with a performance from Robert Duvall for the ages. He was perfect in those few scenes he was in and I wish the film would've dealt with him instead. The entrance in the helicopters with the classical music and then the surfing in the middle of the war zone was so hilarious; one of the best scenes in film history. I was really feeling good about this movie, until the film went completely in another direction and lost my interest.The movie takes place during the Vietnam War and it begins with a voice over narration of the main character, Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen), who has recently returned from the United States to continue fighting. He is beginning to lose his mind while he awaits his mission. He says all he wanted to do when he was in the jungle was return home, and once he was home all he wanted was to return to the jungle. War has taken its toll on him. Finally he receives a new mission from Colonel Lucas (Harrison Ford) that is highly classified. He has to go down the Nung River all the way to Cambodia and find a former Colonel who has seemed to have lost his mind and gone haywire. He has built an army of his own and is killing off several Viet Cong officials without taking orders from anyone. Colonel Lucas wants Captain Willard to locate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) and kill him. Willard is sent on his mission along with a Navy patrol boat to escort him. Chief Phillips (Albert Hall), Chef Hicks (Frederic Forrest), Lance Johnson (Sam Bottoms) a known surfer, and Clean Miller (Laurence Fishburne) are Captain Willard's only companions on this classified mission. In order to begin their course down the river they first have to infiltrate a Viet Cong outpost so Lt. Kilgore (Robert Duvall) and his cavalry help them do so. As Captain Willard and his men begin their descent through the river they come across several bases (friendly and enemy) and the further down we go the more chaotic and wild things begin to get.The descent through the Nung River was probably my least favorite part of the film. I enjoyed much more the scenes with Lt. Kilgore and his men that helped them begin their mission. Duvall as Lt. Kilgore steals the movie and he is brilliant in every scene. He is more concerned with surfing than he is with the actual War. It's as if he is living in an alternate reality. This is just a small glimpse of what we are going to see further on in the movie as we encounter different outposts that seem to get weirder every time. Everything is escalating up to the very end and seems to get more and more chaotic thus making the title, Apocalypse Now, very appropriate. This isn't your typical war movie, people are losing their minds and the film becomes more and more surreal and harder to fit into one specific genre. Francis Ford Coppola was at the top of his game during the 70's with The Godfather films and you can see how brilliantly directed the scenes were. The cinematography and lighting was excellent. The reason I don't give this film a higher grade despite admitting it is a memorable and unique movie is because I really wasn't entertained that much with it. It would be hard to watch it again, unless I could just see that first hour with Robert Duvall. The all star cast makes it a little easier to watch Robert Duvall, Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Harrison Ford, and Laurence Fishburne. http\/\/estebueno10.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"25 July 2012","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" ¨I love the smell of napalm in the morning.¨There is no doubt that Apocalypse Now will be considered by many as one of the best films of all time because it is a very memorable and unique film.

It is really a great movie that has stayed in my mind all this time. When I saw the opportunity to buy it at a discount, I grabbed it. Tonight I watched it again, and being my age, it inspired me again. The love the couples have for each other is tremendous and the camaraderie of the friendships is truly something that few have ever experienced. I really love that the older you get does not mean that life is gone. I got a hard-on, you got one too God that made me laugh and think. Why should life end just because we get old? I have always believed we were not alone in this universe. As Jody Foster says in Contact Do you think there is life on other planets? Her dad replies I don't know, Sparks. But I guess I'd say if it is just us... seems like an awful waste of space. I have always believed there are others out there.

You can barely turn your head without having a new Marvel or DC Comics-production slapping your face. Back in 1978 however, a full-length, big budget production with one of the most iconic superheroes of all time was a really big deal. It does feels nice to take a break from the CGI-laden world of modern movies and watch some good old physical props and light-shows, as well as some good acting and likable characters.This movie tells the origin of Superman. We begin on the planet Krypton where the scientist Jor-el, Supermans father played by Marlon Brando, is trying to convince the planets council that Krypton is doomed and that the planet should be evacuated. They do not listen however, and the planets inevitable destruction brings an end to the Kryptonians. At least almost, because Jor-el and his wife (whose name escapes me) manages to send their son, Kal-el, away in an escape pod headed to earth. When he arrives he is being taken care of by foster parents and we get to follow him trough his younger years, his self-discovery, and his employment with Daily Planet as well as how he first establishes his superhero fame.This movie takes its time to tell the story, and it comes off very well. You really get attached to the main character and receives a full understanding of what Superman is about. The movie balances action and comedy, never taking itself too seriously, which is a nice break from modern cinema were everything have to be dark and serious. The movie can be corny sometimes, but in a likable way, a way that makes you smile rather than roll your eyes. That doesn't mean that it's all silly, there is some genuine emotion in it as well. Christopher Reeves is great in the leading role, pulling off both the awkwardness of Clark Kent and the heroic posture of Superman perfectly. His act as Clark Kent is so quirky and clumsy that you actually believe that no one suspects him for being Superman, despite that his only disguise is a pair of glasses! Another great performance is Margot Kidder as Louis Lane. She could easily have been turned into another damsel in distress, but they took the time to actually make her a character. She's witty, quick and in her own way a bit awkward. She is very charismatic and easy too like. Her relationship with Superman feels natural and have real chemistry.One thing that I feel missing though is some real challenge for Superman. Lex Luthor, the villain in the movie, feels a bit to goofy for me. I know that many like Gene Hackman in this movie, but I never saw a genuine, dangerous threat to the protagonist from Lex. He's just goofy, and feels like he belongs in the 1960s Batman series. Overall the movie could need a bit more serious action to bring more excitement to it, and that is exactly what they would bring to the next movie.Overall, if you're into superheroes, this movie is a classic that I highly recommend. It's a great example of an early superhero movie and simply a very enjoyable piece of film. ","genre":null},{"date":"25 July 2012","score":"","review":" Nowadays, superhero movies are everywhere.

A childhood filled with neglect from her father because of her heart condition led to a lack of social interaction. After her mother passes away she moves to central Paris and starts work as a waitress. A new adventure arises in her life when she discovers a hidden treasure in her apartment. She is compelled to return the treasure to the rightful owner and decides that if the owner is filled with joy then she will continue out doing good deeds. Along the way of her journey she frequently passes by Nino Quincampoix and realizes she is in love. At this point she makes it a point to find a way to interact with him without ever talking to him. I feel that the main idea of this movie was to get a person to understand that love can be found anywhere whether you understand it or not. To not give up and to continue to pursue what makes you happy is the only important thing in life. This is shown throughout some of Jean-Pierre Jeunet other films. Films such as The City of Lost Children (1995), A Very Long Engagement (2005), and Delicatessen (1991). When an important item is lost that belongs to you many people search high and low for that important item. Love, a significant other, and passion are all worth looking for. This is shown throughout these movies in a very interesting and captivating way. A few of the different techniques were used in Amelie to make this movie a one of a kind. The different special effects that director Jeunet used helped to make the film feel more alive and awake. When Amelie helped out Dominique Bretodeau restore his childhood memories her heart lite up and the scene showed the large amount of energy glowing off her heart.

A childhood filled with neglect from her father because of her heart condition led to a lack of social interaction. After her mother passes away she moves to central Paris and starts work as a waitress. A new adventure arises in her life when she discovers a hidden treasure in her apartment. She is compelled to return the treasure to the rightful owner and decides that if the owner is filled with joy then she will continue out doing good deeds. Along the way of her journey she frequently passes by Nino Quincampoix and realizes she is in love. At this point she makes it a point to find a way to interact with him without ever talking to him. I feel that the main idea of this movie was to get a person to understand that love can be found anywhere whether you understand it or not. To not give up and to continue to pursue what makes you happy is the only important thing in life. This is shown throughout some of Jean-Pierre Jeunet other films. Films such as The City of Lost Children (1995), A Very Long Engagement (2005), and Delicatessen (1991). When an important item is lost that belongs to you many people search high and low for that important item. Love, a significant other, and passion are all worth looking for. This is shown throughout these movies in a very interesting and captivating way. A few of the different techniques were used in Amelie to make this movie a one of a kind. The different special effects that director Jeunet used helped to make the film feel more alive and awake.

Ever since the beginning of cinema, filmmakers have been turning to vintage films to create their own works. Gus Van Sant's remake of Hitchcock's 1960 masterwork Psycho takes a different approach. This one is a shot-for-shot remake. Van Sant uses Joseph Stefano's screenplay, Bernard Hermann's iconic score, with a new cast of actors, color photography, and attempts to copy the original's camera shots and editing. This is an interesting idea that, unfortunately, doesn't work. Hitchcock purposefully shot Psycho in black-and-white in order to give the film a gloomy atmosphere and to make sure that it didn't come off as too gory. While Van Sant's Psycho isn't gory, it certainly isn't gloomy. Shooting this story in color takes away the edgy quality of the original, and this movie plays it too safe. Van Sant mentioned that some audience members don't like black-and-white, which I understand, but complete color doesn't work for Psycho (maybe if the color scheme was more subdued, it would have worked).The performances of the four leads are quite bland. Vince Vaughn, attempting to put his own spin on Anthony Perkins' iconic performance, falls flat. Right off the bat, he comes across as creepy (Perkins made the audience unaware of what lurks beneath Norman Bates' surface, which made him all the more effective). Anne Heche plays Marion Crane as if the film were a romantic comedy, which it certainly isn't (Janet Leigh gave Marion a sympathy which Heche doesn't even attempt). Julianne Moore's Lila is annoying, and seems to think that shouting all of her lines make her sound angry (Vera Miles took a more subdued approach which showed Lila's fury and tiredness). Viggo Mortenson is completely boring as Marion's boyfriend, and is forgettable (John Gavin was more memorable). William H. Macy is the only one who comes off well as Arbogast, the private detective.Is the film really bad? Well, not really. Danny Elfman's adaptation of Hermann's score sounds great in stereo, but lacks the edge Hermann gave in the original. Some of the supporting cast comes off well, but the whole affair comes across as flat and tired. If you don't compare it to the original, I guess it could be slightly better, but when you try to copy an excellent original shot-for-shot, it becomes hard to do. This film is similar to going to see a hit Broadway musical, and getting the understudies at your performance.

It opens with 'Boris' ( Allen ) in a cell awaiting execution. What circumstances brought him to this predicament? The film goes into flashback mode. Boris is in love with 'Sonja' ( Diane Keaton ), his beautiful cousin, but she prefers his brother 'Ivan', whom Boris claims cannot even write his own name in the ground with a stick. He is then caught up in the Napoleonic Wars ( we kill Frenchmen, they kill Russians, before you know it, its Easter! ), and against the odds, becomes a hero, seducing a beautiful countess ( Olga Georges-Picot ). He finally marries Sonja, but it is not a happy union, although she manages to make some wonderful dishes out of snow. Sonja then comes up with her grand master plan - the assassination of Napoleon Bonaparte...As with his other films of this period, most of the gags have a strong Marx Brothers flavour, along with anachronisms such as Boris and a gang of cheerleaders suddenly appearing on the battlefield, along with a hot-dog vendor. There is a duelling sequence which one can imagine might have worked for Harpo Marx. Keaton, as ever, is excellent. Her meaningless discussions with Boris over the futility of human existence are priceless. Boris is agnostic; If only I could see a miracle...if only God would just cough!. My favourite moment is Boris quoting from the Bible Yay, I will walk through the valley in the shadow of death...come to think, I will RUN through through the valley in the shadow of death...you get out the valley quicker that way!. 'Love & Death' ends with the sight of Boris and the Grim Reaper dancing through trees. It is easy to see the scene now as symbolically bringing to a close this era of Woody Allen movies. He was smart to make the change when he did as the television show 'Saturday Night Live' was about to unleash a new wave of comedians - such as Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, John Belushi, and Dan Ackroyd - who went on to define 80's American film comedy.
