The Book world at least anyway. This is as fine a Tom Hanks \/ Meg Ryan film as you will see. Both personalities were made for this script although it is more likely the script was made with then in mind. Hanks' world is dominated with being the 'Book Zsar' of New Yorks West Side but his life is turned upside down after an encounter in a jammned elevator. Meg Ryan is the sugary sweet heroine who falters not and just about keeps it together in the face of personal disaster. The characters transformation from bitter business rivals to the inevitable lovers is both as pleasant as it is expected. This does not spoil the film however as the journey to this end is what makes this film superb. Both Hanks and Ryan seem familiar in these roles and so they should as the characters could be straight out of 'Sleepless' in another timeline.

He gets sacked when one of his bosses realises.When the film came out I could not be bothered to see another courtroom drama whose conclusion I could foresee. But Tom looks the part, and acts it well. It is true that you can foresee the conclusion, but Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington, and pretty much every one (including Antonio Banderas as Tom Hank's lover) do a pretty good job.What is it about Tom Hanks? It is not as if he really looked like any of the gays I have known, or that he really pulled of being dying. But he always manages to entice the audience in, to make them believe in something, I am not sure what, perhaps that Tom is the person he is playing. I wonder if Tom Hanks exist in real life. Tom Hanks the actor is just beautiful to watch.The Opera Scene did not do it for me. I am uncouth but I have heard some opera. I know that it can be really moving. But Tom, eyes shut, giving a weepy commentary to some Aria made me think that Demme (the director) had seen and was moved by the penultimate (and other) scenes of Amadeus. The camera spirals down on the weeping Tom giving commentary to Maria Callas, and the single clarinet (or was it cello?) But F. Murray Abraham does a fair sight better with his interpretation of Mozart (in Amadeus, 1983)....Then suddenly - high above it - an oboe, a single note, hanging there unwavering, till a clarinet took over and sweetened it into a phrase of such delight! This was no composition by a performing monkey! This was a music I'd never heard. Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing, it had me trembling. It seemed to me that I was hearing a voice of God.But that was all an aside. In Philadelphia, Tom Hanks is very convincing as a dying gay. Denzel Washington is fairly convincing as a homophobe that overcomes. And, despite being a film about a guy dying, it is even a cheerful, and almost not corny flick. Watch it on video. It is well worth the rental.  ","genre":null},{"date":"24 September 2003","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  Tom Hanks has AIDS, from the start of the film.
