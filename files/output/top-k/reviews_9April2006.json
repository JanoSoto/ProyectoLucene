Starring Jim Broadbent, Allan Corduner, Leslie Manville, Ron Cook, Dexter Fletcher, Sukie Smith, Wendy Nottingham, Roger Heathcott, Stefan Bednarczyk, Geoffrey Hutchings, Timoth Spall, Francis Lee, William Neeman...Music From Gilbert and Sullivan's operettas including The Mikado....1999 Director Michael Leigh brings to life the world of Gilbert and Sullivan's musical theater scene in 1880's London. British actors Jim Broadbent (Harry Zidler in 2001's Moulin Rouge, The Professor in 2005's Narnia) and Alan Corduner star as the illustrious English librettist\/compose team Gilbert and Sullivan who composed comic and energetic operettas which would later evolve into today's American musicals. The strength of this film lies in the exquisite cinematography which vividly depicts the time period. The overall look of the film, from the costumes, furniture to theater and home interiors, are accurate to the historical period. The plot of this film is drawn from the actual account of how Gilbert and Sullivan's most famous opera The Mikado (about satirical feudal Japanisme) came to be made. After the failure of Princess Ida, a Mediveal fantasy-opera, Gilbert and Sullivan were determined to make their greatest, most talked-about opera, and one which would save them financially. They were under contract with Richard D'Oyle Carte Opera. D'Oyle (Ron Cook)gives them a few days to come up with a great opera. Conflict ensues between the two musical geniuses. Arthur Sullivan wants to break away from the partnership to compose serious works of classical music. It was the Mikado that reunited them and saved their carers. The rest of the cast are doing superb acting, especially Leslie Manville as Gilbert's smart wife. The movie is rather long, and quite talky, but enough time is given for us to dwell in this fascinating world of make-up, music, theater, and enough time to experience the process of putting on an opera- from casting, to rehearsals, to costume-making to research for the concept of a Japanese theme. The rest of the cast are actual Gilbert and Sullivan operetta singers. In London, more than in America, Gilbert and Sullivan continues to remain popular musical theater. English Canada is also well known for its Gilbert and Sullivan tributes. This was a time in England before World War I, when Queen Victoria was still reigning, and when the British where happily engaged in their middle-class to upper-class lifestyle within the city, not knowing that the imperialism they were spreading would create conflict. It's a film that appeals to theater-lovers, historical movie lovers and Gilbert and Sullivan fans. It's a pleasure to watch and the finale, in which after a lot of chaos, everything comes together beautifully, is moving. A great film!

I had seen a lot of movies by Jim Jarmusch before this one, and I certainly didn't think he had it in him to make what may be the last truly great western, but that's what this is. Johnny Depp is a nerdy accountant that slowly becomes a legendary outlaw in this hyper-genre film, that also features Billy Bob Thornton, Iggy Pop, and in a truly iconic role, Robert Mitchum.The plot is allegorical. The cinemotogrophys is always top-notch. The score, by Neal Young, is both modern, and still western. (It's like a minimalist Ennio Morriconne!) Everything about this movie clicks in to place in a way movies normally don't click in to place...which is what you should expect from a Jim Jarmusch film.
