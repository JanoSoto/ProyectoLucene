[{"date":"13 May 2010","score":"","review":" Eleven years ago, we were still taking comic book super hero movies way too seriously, but with the twin onslaught of that Batman and Ironman high budget slick messes and attendant commercial successes and predictable gushings, this movie makes even more sense. Comic book super heroes are silly and juvenile and this move treats them in a satirical but understanding way. This has ensemble cast of good actors playing the most obscure un-heroic un-super sub heroes ever conceived. It is funny and half way intelligent, and some of the super heroes like Pee Wee Herman's Spleen, who can knock out bad guys with precision farts, is funny but not too crude. The heroes all have their quirks & personalities and the dialog and humor is good. We have William Macy playing The Shoveler, a regular not bright laborer by day who fights crime with a silver plated spade at night. Then there is the Blue Raja, played by Hank Azaria who sells high end silverware by day and talks with an English accent as he attempts to subdue criminals by throwing forks and spoons, not knives. Geoffry Rush plays the requisite mad scientist evil bad guy, Casanova Frankenstein, threatening to kill the premier superhero and blow up the world, right on. Go see it, it's a lot of fun. My main complaint is the tackiness of styles, from cars to clothes, that passes for comic book camp, with cheesy styles from the 30's up to the present tossed in that frankly were unsightly and annoying. We had them drive around in some 50s station wagon, the Shoveler's family car by day, chasing Casanova Frankenstein in his stretch limo made out of a 67 Corvette Stingray to the Disco Boys bad gang stuck in the 70s.
