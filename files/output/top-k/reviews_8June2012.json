(I could go even further and assume that what's happening here is similar to what we see in Identity, where the different personalities of a single schizophrenic mind act out a particular psychodrama).Let's go beyond the lousy dialogs, the gross overacting, and let's wonder why these people are acting so aggressively towards each other. They are total strangers to each other, yet they treat the rest as if they hated them, as if the others were a nuisance. Furthermore, they are all very confused, mentally, and when it comes to bring to the open the more personal aspects of their usual lives all what they are able to display are phobias, traumas, frustrations, past tragedies and even some conspiratorial obsession that include aliens.(Where is the sheer enjoyment of life here?).So, there is absolutely no positive vibes coming from any of them, except for the Maths girl&#x97;and only when doing her numbers. We may easily conclude that these people have no lives. They have been fetched from their regular existences but we may readily assume that those existences are even emptier than the one they are having here. Like the men lost in the desert in Flight of the Phoenix, they want to go back to their regular lives but there is no hint whatsoever that those lives are in any way enjoyable, worthy of living them.In a perverse sense, the utterly unlikable characters; the terrible dialogs, the depressing atmosphere, the nauseous mood, the regular, perplexing, changes in personal behavior; the lack of logical explanations for their plight; the terrible, brutal, attitude of every one of them towards the rest; the fact that the mental handicapped is the only one coming out in the end--make all the sense in the world.

My advice is to meet with this gently, have no thought what it's about, let the burden of names and trifle detail flow through you. Use it like you were calibrating the eye to focus.By itself the film is uninteresting and not really worth the energy required to investigate. On the page, I suppose the situation to have been somehow mitigated by Chandler's wit and prose but the plot is all of it disposable. If I kept on the right track, we have three sets of blackmail, six counts of murder, plus a seventh revealed near the end, and all sorts of trickery, fronts, and storymaking between players. But two sets of unconnected circumstances elevate this to something that is required viewing and working with.The Hays Code was one, a simple effect; none of Chandler's titillation about drugs and pornography could ever reach the big screen, so all the sex is staged between a camera concealed inside a statue and us getting to imagine about it. It works better than if it were explicit.The second one is even more incidental, a boozing Faulkner had shown up from Mississippi to write for the movies. Now I don't presume the finished script was either fully by design or by complete lack of it, since Faulkner didn't care beyond a paycheck, rather the result of handing out Chandler's hard and thin sense of reality to a literary giant of the most awesomely intuitive nature, capable for the most multilayered memory. Add to that reshoots of the film several months later, sexual innuendo between Bacall\/Bogart spliced in, a key scene where Marlowe explains the plot left on the cutting room floor, and you already have enough pieces of the puzzle missing.Or what I call the Ambersons Effect, after the Welles film. This a situation where no writer is in full control of the complicated story originally intended, quite clearly in our case. The famous story is that Chandler had to be phoned back to shed some light on the cluster of murders.So we get a twist on Chandler's twist of the story, but following Marlowe's assembly of that story, the culprit is shot to pieces before we have a chance to corroborate. We leave the film thinking Marlowe got it right, had to.Here's where the world of allusive accidents kicks into effect.The framing device, this is where Carmen was going to be framed for murder, is a set of photos and a daze that makes her as a viewer susceptible to stories! Isn't this us?Chandler used sex and drugs to explain but that is gone. We just have the mystifying stupor, the girl drowsy in a Chinese dress. We have the concealed camera.We have Marlowe's coolly laid-out solution to the story, after the old blueprint of detective fiction - Holmes, Perry Mason, the mode that Chandler wrote in - so quite independent of the viewer. His snappy rat-ta-tat as he explains is followed moments later by the staccato sound of machine-gun fire that kills off the only one who could say if it was so.But upon reflection, the thing seems a bit off, ordinary logic broken in the process, this creates strangely ambiguous perturbations through a world we just experienced as rational and finite. Marlowe's story is near as possible as everyone else's, but the entire film leading up to it has been believable stories exposed as fabrication. The alternative reading I prefer, is that Marlowe solves blackmail but in doing so suspects he may have fallen for the wrong woman. So he investigates a second plot that is stories made-up by this woman to guard herself, in the end he unspools this in the only way where she turns out innocent and his instincts right all along.This is great the way we have it, a lesson in the relative dynamics of storytelling.

He is working as a janitor at M.I.T. when he solves a maths formula that is meant to challenge the best students at the university. Will is also on probation after he hit a cop. Mathematics professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) takes Will under his wing, seeing the potential in him to do whatever he wants and gets his friend Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) to counsel the young man. Will also meets Skylar (Minnie Driver), a British Harvard student and starts a relationship with her. But Will is his also his own worst enemy.Screenplay is really strong and you can see why Ben Affleck has become a respected director. It was a dialogue driven film that focuses on a character who is troubled, who has a tremendous give but is bitter towards people who had the wealth and luxury to go to university. He is also a man who does not know how lucky he is that people care about him and does not realise how lucky he is with his intelligence. There is a great cast who give authentic performances, Damon, Skarsgard, Williams (who won an Oscar for this role) and Driver in the main roles. There are not good guys or bad guys, they are shares of grey with all of them and the real antagonist is Will to himself. Skarsgard and Williams' characters have different approaches and views about Will but they both have his best interests at heart. Will starts off as a real jerk and I personally enjoyed it when Williams' character does get to give Will a telling off.Gus Van Sant could have made visually safe film but he was able to inject a style to the film, using hand-held cameras for long shots and panning shots and edited TV footage from a famous Red Sox game whilst Sean tells Will the story about how he met his wife. Van Sant to able to make sure all the different stories involving Will's life all get a fair amount of screenplay and it is easy to follow who is who and what is happening.

I was taught to see racism only in individual acts of meanness, not in invisible systems conferring dominance on my group. - Peggy McIntoshEconomics is haunted by more fallacies than any other study known to man. - Henry HazlittBread and Roses was director Ken Loach's first feature to be set (and filmed?) in the United States. The film was funded by small European financiers and received limited distribution in the US. Though Loach waters down his narrative for Hollywood audiences &#x96; the film's fairly conventional, plot-wise &#x96; his customary mix of political sermonising and urgent neorealism (what he calls socioeconomic realism, an offshoot of socialist realism) remains absolutely abhorrent to most moviegoers. For this, he remains marginalised. Its title alluding to a 1912 textile mill strikes in Massachusetts, Bread and Roses revolves around a workers' strike in a non-union office building in downtown Los Angeles, the home of Hollywood. Much of the film revolves around impoverished office workers and Latino immigrants, who struggle for decent wages, to keep their families together and to fight against their ethnic and professional invisibility. Sounds familiar? Loach has been making such films for decades, but this is one of his best. He skirts around most Coroporations vs Little Guys clichés, and focuses instead on the ways in which underclasses prey upon themselves, and how such bickering serves only to bolster exploitation. Corporate executives and limousine liberals, who pick up humanitarian awards while relying on custodial firms who pay less than minimum wage, remain off camera, alluded to but never seen. Loach's cast is primarily composed of non-actors, but some famous faces turn up. Adrien Brody plays a young union organiser named Sham Shapiro, and exudes a nice mix of likability, scruffy dissidence and intolerable smugness, his character self-righteously mouthing union maxims from the safety of suburbia. He organises the workers, helps them unionize, but they take all the risks, and his sheltered, financially stable life-style is far removed from their squalor. Brody's the son of the great Sylvia Plachy, photographer, artist, left-winger and radical. Comedian George Lopez also turns up. He essentially plays a supervisor of janitors, a monstrous spawn of capitalism and Latino machismo who protects his position by ruthlessly enacting the will of the bosses, cultural and familial ties be damned. And then there's veteran actress Elpidia Carrillo, who plays a burnt-out Mexican woman who betrays the unions. A volcanic last act revelation, in which she spells out for her righteously indignant little sister why she did what she did, is particularly mind blowing. Here the actress summons a powerful blend of tear-inducing pain and fury. Her revelation hammers home the point of the film, the point of many of Loach's films, and a point which Bertolt Brecht famously laid out almost a century ago in The Threepenny Opera First comes food, then comes morality. Brecht's statement encapsulates a range of human behaviours, primarily two which operate as a sort of double-helix or feedback loop; man ignores immorality because he fears of losing what he has, and man ignores morality when he has nothing. Somewhat unique for this type of film, Loach's immigrants are not portrayed as some ubiquitous, exotic mass, but full characters with diverging, very individual views, some indifferent, some self-centred, some politically informed (and indifferent or self-centred for diametrically opposed reasons) and some engaged in political activity back in Mexico. They are not naive pawns led by Brody, who in another director's hands may have developed into a white saviour. Brody's gang are real, savvy, and have their own deeply embedded (and often conflicting) modes of survival. For all its cathartic fury, for all its nods to 1920s Soviet Cinema, with its marching militants, placard pumping, Eisensteinian ideals and collective heroes, Loach's last act is ultimately pessimistic. Our heroes are shipped back to Mexico and we're suspicious of even what little has been won. Loach, like John Sayles, is too much of a small thinker to navigate his way out of the problems his films deal with. And while his brand of cinema is necessary, there is a feeling that, as Theodor Adorno once showed, though art represents a resistance to the violence of conformist thinking, non-conformity itself wasted away long ago, became insipid, became consumer goods. Art can no longer be a refuge for truth, Adorno believed, in the long term it will merely represent a flight into illusion, even if it does have a dialectic force. Still, Loach at least encourages some engagement with a prevalent form of cultural metapathy, which is not just traditional apathy, but a pathological indifference, in which all manners of misconduct (from stolen elections to benign policies which actively court illegal immigrants) can happen without the batting of an eyelid.8.5\/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing.

That Moore apparently received the Razzie award for worst actress is simply incomprehensible &#x96; I thought she was completely compelling in her role as single mother who is threatened along with her teenage son by the mob unless she cooperates as a juror in rendering a not-guilty verdict for a guilty mobster.

Rather than jump to a decision, she struggles; she goes this way and that, unsure, terrified. I think this is the way most of us would act if put in a similar situation.

And once I saw the sequel, I could not believe how derivatively messy it had become. When it came to this film, I wasn't sure what to expect. Peter Weller had moved on and Robert Burke had taken over as the ironclad police officer. According to the majority of viewers, RoboCop 3 was garbage. Turns out though, I liked it. Maybe not as much as the first for various reasons but at least this movie carried forward with the story of Alex Murphy. Unlike the first sequel that drove us in circles.RoboCop is back one more time to save the city of old Detroit. But this time, it is on a much bigger scale. It is not mentioned to how the old man of OCP disappeared, but it's assumed that he finally died. Now in charge of OCP is the CEO, played by actor Rip Torn, and it's up to him to make sure a place called Cadillac Heights is ready for deconstruction within a certain date. So to remove the people from this area requires a group of officers called The Rehabs.

And it's not productive to make a sequel and have its rating changed from all the others that came before it. I understand that the reason is to have a broader audience of ages but how does it help when the kids don't even know who RoboCop is or what his background was? It's a plan of failure and Dekker should have seen that.Not to mention that RoboCop has a machine gun that he can now attach to his body. God that would have been cool to see if this film was rated R! Plus, he can fly now too. Yeah big deal to some of you skeptics but it really is a nice addition. Basil Poledouris is back as well, to do the his noted music again for this franchise. So that's a plus. And the best part is by the end of this film, Alex Murphy at least finds a group of people who don't treat him like an investment but more like a human. Isn't that what we wanted from the past two films? I did.Having the last installment being rated PG-13 was a wrong move but it can be seen that Dekker's team tried hard to bring back the other elements that made the first film a hit.

Which is what the main protags Michel and Patricia seem to do for a fair chunk of the film.The opening sequence sees Michel travel down Goddard's favourite road in France (the exact same one he features prominently later in the Weekend), a tree lined asphalt cut through sun scorched flat plane. Michel attracts the notice of police for a minor traffic violation and decides the best course of action is step on the pedal and play chase. When a cop does eventually catch up with him, Michel pulls out a pistol and shoots him dead. All of this transpires within five or so minutes, and I'm left wondering but why? Why? Who does this? Why shoot the cop for nothing and bring down the long arm of the law on yourself? Well, my dear, I can hear Godard saying, we've got to start this movie somehow or other, just go with the flow, cherish the 'rebel without a cause' style of Michel.Next up, Michel meets up with American Patricia, whom he's known for three weeks and seems to have fallen for. Patricia stumble-bumbles about in her Twiggy hairdo, bobby socks and long pleated skirt and her poor French accent which we are blessedly spared from overuse, as she tends to be monotonic, mostly saying things such as 'I don't know', or 'Its all the same thing'. A blander non character I've never seen. What Michel sees in her remains a mystery, both to him and frankly to me. Patricia does, however, have some sort of avante-guarde visage for a 1960 film she seems to be a slut, through and through, which would have been novel for the time. I can't figure out if making her an American slut wasn't a political machination on Godard's part in order to spare the 'purity' of French girls? In any event, as Patricia reels off various conquests, I'm doing mental calculations; when did the Pill debut? Surely it wasn't around in 1960? How does Patricia get away with it, then? Well, she doesn't, it turns out. She's pregnant. Not entirely sure who the father is, but most likely candidate is Michel. Oh, and puffing on ciggies non stop. Maybe they didn't know back then?....Now follows the bed scene. God, the French love their bed mis en scenes, remember 'My Night at Maude's' here. An hour of rolling around on the bed, chain smoking and trying to be brazen about love, life and everything under the sun. Just as I felt my eyes beginning to glaze over, the gruesome twosome finally decided to get out of bed and hit the Champs Elyzee, which is always a treat to see through out the ages as it were. Michel finds out he is a wanted man by the police, so he decides to run for it next port of call Italy. Can Patricia please come with him? No, Patricia can not. She likes all the bad boy antics, but when it comes down to it, she's going to marry some straight and narrow guy, live in a house with a white picket fence and have 2.2 children.All fine and good, but why, oh why does she have to call the police and give Michel away? This seemed an unnecessary tactic. Michel refuses to run because, he says, he is tired. Again, incongruous and out of character for him. He is in his early twenties and has so far displayed a casual devil may care attitude to life. How did he get tired all of a sudden? Is Godard in a rush to wrap things up and so throws everything into a one pot Massala for a grande denouement? Yes, he does. Grande ending ensues within next five minutes with gun shots and Michel prostrate in the 'foothills' of the Eiffel Tower, making funny faces at his beloved. In a rather powerful finale gesture he closes his own eyes pre-mortem and expires on cue for brilliant theatrical effect.Still, what the hell just happened here, apart from a Frenchified homage to Bonnie and Clyde?

It also was the right approach to take in my opinion, since this movie would had been an incredible dry and heavy one had it been done as a completely serious drama.Definitely watchable but I should still say that this movie most definitely won't be everybody's cup of tea.7\/10 http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"8 June 2012","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I don't remember the name of the journalist who spoke this statement, but I want to say a big amen to that, as my saddest movie involves all these three factors, I know they might sound a little too male-oriented but I'm pretty sure it at least touched upon two branches of this trinity for female audiences, can't women also respond to the sight of a little grief-stricken boy inconsolably crying over the loss of his father, and making grown-up men weep as well? I want to open this review by saying that The Champ holds a very special place in my heart, if only because it might be the first live-action movie I remember seeing as a (6-year old) kid, and for some strange reason, of all the scenes from the film, I was more impacted by the sight of blood, a disturbing novelty for my kiddies' eyes (the sparring partner, the horse's injury and the scary sight of Billy's opponent shouting at him). 4 years later, I saw it and every one was bawling in the TV room, everyone but me, mostly amused by these reactions. The Youtube clips many years later finally had their effect, but even then I knew I had to experience the whole film to measure up the extent of its emotionality.So I did and I can't believe someone who despises the overuse of superlatives like me would indulge himself to such a clichéd statement but this is indeed the saddest movie ever, with the climactic locker-room scene as the most defining moment. Adapted from a 1931 movie directed by King Vidor, The Champ, is about a father-and-son relationship, an extraordinary sacred link between Billy Flynn (Jon Voight), an ex-Heavyweight Boxing Champion who reconverted in horse-training, and his 8-year old blond-haired angel-faced son T.J. (Ricky Shroeder). To say that T.J. loves his father would be a huge understatement; he literally worships him to the point of calling him 'Champ' instead of 'Dad'. I can recall considering my father a true model when I was a kid, I can easily respond to the sight of a kid who admires his father the way T.J. does, especially since this adoration is the build-up that cements the final scene's emotionality.A few words about Ricky Schroeder's performance it's absolutely refreshing to see a child acting like a real one, not too mature or annoying, Ricky Shroeder delivers in The Champ one of the finest pieces of child acting ever, on the same vein than Jackie Coogan in The Kid, any kids' performance pale in comparison to little Ricky that year and I can't believe his performance was overlooked by the Academy Awards (while he was awarded a Golden Globe for Best Male Newcomer). The irony is that the same year, an even younger kid was nominated for a similar role; it was Justin Henry as Billy in Kramer vs. Kramer. I guess Henry was favored in regard of the film's commercial success and the fact that his character was more 'complex', but let's face it, even Justin Henry wouldn't claim to have made millions of people all over the world cry like Ricky did.The parallel with Kramer vs. Kramer can be extended to the father and boy's situation. The mother Annie (Faye Dunaway) left, Billy had the custody and every thing went fine, despite some financial and gambling problems, until Annie showed up again and expressed her desire to take part again in her son's life, her son who thinks his mother died. The film takes then the emotional start with the most simple plot premise and it only avoid cliché's annoyances thanks to the beautiful performance of Ricky Schroeder. Indeed, every single moment work and it almost seems like the adult actors did their best to match Ricky's incredible acting, and I believe that Jon Voight deserved more accolades for his performance.The film contains some of the most emotional moments you'll ever see, reaching a first pinnacle with three powerful scenes in a row a heart-breaking father-and-son conversation in jail, T.J. learning that Annie is not a little angel in the sky and his outburst of enraged cries when she can't even say that she loves 'Champ', and then the reunion with Billy, hell even the happier moments are unbelievably sad, with little T.J. and his father swimming on the beach (mirroring a previous scene with Annie). It's so effective that I dare even the most skeptical movie viewers to label this film as manipulative. Franco Ziffereli's directing is relatively sober and the music not too over-emotional, so if anything is manipulative, then it has to be a little 8-year old actor's performance, would you believe he'd have this intention? To conclude, I sincerely don't think any film would have as a powerful emotional impact as The Champ's final scene. Sticking with my own conviction, I even googled the title of the film and the words 'saddest ever' and to my pleasant surprise, I discovered that some scientists after many studies found out that the film could be considered as the saddest ever from the way people were immediately responding to its most emotional scenes (notably the final one). Many readers mentioned titles such as Bambi, Brian's Song, Schindler's List, Terms of Endearment or Grave of the Fireflies but I think they missed the point of the study which was less about giving a title than determining the most likely film to induce one particular reaction among the majority, in that case crying.I remember my father told me that after watching the film in the theater, everyone was weeping and sneezing, he recommended the film to his toughest friends challenging them not to cry, but at the end, they were all bawling like little girls. Like it or not, it deserves the title of 'emotional masterpiece' and I don't think any rational critic will convince me to give it a 'reasonable' rating.

This movie is like watching a comic book western movie come to life and although the plot is a bit absurd it's creative and has substance to it. Despite the it going in a narrow direction but it goes in a narrow direction with at least some substance. The plot is about a woman named Ellen aka Lady(Sharon Stone) who is a badass cowgirl that comes to a western town with a motive and ends up in a quick draw tournament with bunch of contestants. Anyone can challenge anyone in this tournament. The reward for winning the tournament is 120,000 dollars and the last man standing takes it all. What I liked about this movie besides it being a movie about a quick draw tournament in the west is how fun, intriguing and creative the action scenes are. A bit wacky at times but still pretty cool to watch, even the dialogue is a bit comic book like. Sharon Stone is charismatic and very attractive in this, especially with the cowgirl attire. Leo is pretty good as the Kid even if he can be a little annoying at times. Gene Hackman stands out as the villain without overdoing it and actually backs up what he says for the most part unless when he is unsure. So it isn't a shock why he owns the whole western town but this isn't the first western Gene has been in. Russell Crowe is in this and although he plays decent part in the story his character ain't nothing special and sort of comes off mundane but he was in good shape. Despite his mysterious past.

The plot is about a woman named Ellen aka Lady(Sharon Stone) who is a badass cowgirl that comes to a western town with a motive and ends up in a quick draw tournament with bunch of contestants. Anyone can challenge anyone in this tournament. The reward for winning the tournament is 120,000 dollars and the last man standing takes it all. What I liked about this movie besides it being a movie about a quick draw tournament in the west is how fun, intriguing and creative the action scenes are. A bit wacky at times but still pretty cool to watch, even the dialogue is a bit comic book like. Sharon Stone is charismatic and very attractive in this, especially with the cowgirl attire. Leo is pretty good as the Kid even if he can be a little annoying at times. Gene Hackman stands out as the villain without overdoing it and actually backs up what he says for the most part unless when he is unsure. So it isn't a shock why he owns the whole western town but this isn't the first western Gene has been in. Russell Crowe is in this and although he plays decent part in the story his character ain't nothing special and sort of comes off mundane but he was in good shape. Despite his mysterious past. Overall I enjoyed this movie, not one of the best western I seen but it's a pretty cool one.7.8\/10 ","genre":"Action, Thriller, Western"},{"date":"8 June 2012","score":"","review":" I am newbie to IMDb and this is my first review. This film is kind of the one which takes you off guard at the end. If you like Joe pesci from casino then you are gonna love him in this film. He is a typical guy who has screwed up his life pretty well. But he is obligated to take the task at hand. He is a attorney in the film. Marisa Tomei is his girlfriend and has done justice to the role. All the characters have turned out well. The film has humor in a Joe pesci sort of way. A must watch for guys who love a beautiful twist at the end. Just relax a little bit, stretch your arms on a Saturday night and watch the movie. You would have a sound sleep and a good mood in the morning.P.S - I know that you think this is crap and gonna click NO!

What I remembered most was that my very favourite character was Diesel 10 who was the villain of the story who is a Warship Diesel with a claw and a very bad attitude who loves to cut up bits of old iron for a living! (This was before Iron Arry And Iron Bert came along!)His sidekicks (Splatter And Dodge who are very similar to Devious Diesel And Iron Arry And Iron Bert) who were Class O8 shunters would also cause chaos and make very rude remarks about the other engines! If you have very young children in your home or if you are A Thomas Fan Like I am, than give this film a go, but do not watch if you are a very grumpy adult or teenager who would prefer to watch Family Guy after work! My Overall Rating is a 5 out of 10! You either love it or hate it!

Music is scored by Maurice Jarre and cinematography by John Searle. Story sees Ford as Allie Fox, an inventor who has grown tired of what he sees as the disintegration of America. With his family in tow, Allie heads for what he hopes to be a happier life in the jungles of Central America. Building a self sufficient utopia, things start swimmingly, but can it last? Where does Allie's ambition end?I have never read the novel, but I have it on good authority that it's cracker-jack stuff. Viewing this brilliant film, I regret not having indulged in the source material first. With that out the way, I can say that Peter Weir's film held me in an vice like grip throughout, it proved to be utterly compelling and beautiful to look at, yet as Allie Fox's ambitions and mindset begin to alter, a bleakness hones in to view and looms large over the picture. Propelled by a quite excellent performance by Ford, his own personal favourite and a film he stands strong in support of, film asks questions of man's place in the imperfect world, idealism and religious fervour; both pro and con. It's a bold and intelligent screenplay by Schrader, which only falters slightly with a mixed message come the denouement. Away from Ford and Searle's sharp photography, Phoenix and Mirren provide very strong support and Weir, a most undervalued director, paces it with his customary slow burn precision.A hidden gem of the 80s and on Ford's CV, The Mosquito Coast is the kind of adult cinema we could do with more of these days. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"8 June 2012","score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" The Mosquito Coast is directed by Peter Weir and adapted to screenplay by Paul Schrader from the novel of the same name written by Paul Theroux. it stars Harrison Ford, Helen Mirren, River Phoenix, Conrad Roberts and Andre Gregory.
