[{"date":"29 May 2002","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  Hugh Grant is widely considered to be one of the more aggravating actors working today. He constantly plays roles which are really only thinly disguised caricatures of the same dainty British guy who has managed to get himself in over his head. Like Woody Allen, his movies are also packed full of little good-naturedly sarcastic one-liners which, ironically, are often the funniest parts of his films. In the James Bond films, the constant barrage of one-liners serve to do little more than remove any scrap of respectability from the films and reduce them to childish excursions full of meaningless sexual innuendos, while in films like Mickey Blue Eyes, these one-liners are quite often genuinely amusing, and some of the better parts of the movie. As the rest of the movie will show, however, having successful one-liners does not by any stretch of the imagination make for a good movie.Grant plays the role of Michael Felgate, an art dealer with a stable career and high hopes of an approaching marriage. He goes through his life happily, running auctions at which he sells obscure paintings for obscene amounts o f money, spending time with his significant other, Gina Vitale (Jeanne Tripplehorn - I'll get to her later), and occasionally dropping amusing wise-cracks. In other words, he's pretty much a regular guy.The introduction of the conflict in the film comes from his efforts to get Gina to agree to marry him. When Michael makes a charming but vain attempt to propose to her through a note inserted into a fortune cookie, Gina freaks out and storms out of the restaurant, telling Michael that she can't, she just can't, leaving him alone in the restaurant and leaving the audience wondering what her intentions had been thus far in the relationship if marriage was so simply out of the question. Besides the botched romance, Tripplehorn delivers an absolutely abysmal performance as the poor poor daughter of the mobster who is just so devastated that she can't marry her true love. She plays the victim well enough, but it's just groan-inducing to watch her make horribly vain attempts to act emotional scenes. Every time she got upset I just wanted to leave the room.The conflict has been thus introduced - Gina can't marry Michael because there are things about her family that he doesn't know about and that she is ashamed to have him discover, which is why she stomped out of the restaurant as though he had admitted cheating on her rather than proposed to her. So after she changes her mind and decides to stay with him just as fast as she rejected him, Michael decides to take it upon himself to get to know her family and thereby resolve any conflict that Gina may have been concerned about.What you have here is a typical formula comedy that unrepentedly feeds off of the stereotypical Italian mafia family, basically stealing the formula from the classic comedies (namingly The Odd Couple, the formula of which has probably been imitated on a plot level more than any other in cinematic history) and adding it to the only bad thing about The Godfather, which is the fact that it presented a tremendously stereotypical account of Italians as criminals. Mickey Blue Eyes does nothing new, but rather adds the typical Hugh Grant character to the above borrowed formulas, resulting in a significantly disappointing comedy.The only mildly amusing things in this film are Michael's occasional witty comments, which are punctuated by a series of painfully unamusing scenes - such anything involving the butchering of a foreign accent or a Chinese restaurant owner screaming at Gina to eat f**king cookie. It's amazing to me that that ridiculous scene made it into this film. For the most part, they at least got their stereotypical representation of the Italian crime family at least partially right. And by that, of course, I mean that they did a god job stealing the traditional hierarchy of Hollywood's version of Italian crime families, and Mickey Blue Eyes does more than it's part to ensure the world that there are no other types of Italian families than this.As far as the performances, not everything was bad. Jeanne Tripplehorn, as I've already mentioned, immensely over-acted her role, reducing her performance almost to farce, and Hugh Grant was horribly miscast from the outset, but there are some performances in the film that are worth noting. Joe Viterelli, who amazingly manages to look decades younger than he is, is back in basically the exact same role that he played in Analyze This, an immensely superior film. James Caan delivers a performance as Gina's mob father that is just about as fantastic as the material will allow, and more than any other, Burt Young as Vito Graziosi, sort of the head of the family, performs so well in his role that he deserves to be in a far better film.It's too bad that Mickey Blue Eyes turned out to be such a spectacular failure, because it works from a premise that could have made for a much better film. In a way, this movie failed in exactly the same way that Hollow Man did - there were nearly endless possibilities, but they were all ignored in favor of the childish slop that you see in the final cut. We can hope that someday someone will steal the premise of this movie and make that better film, but the unfortunate fact is that this is just not the kind of film that strikes filmmakers as something to borrow from.Ah, well...

","genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance"},{"date":"29 May 2002","score":"","review":"  Despite the obvious sarcasm above, I felt this was one of Hugh Grant's best acting efforts; and all in all, a film with surprising depth, charm and meaning. One might be tempted to call it a romantic comedy, but I think it would be more appropriate to call it a slice-of-life-type film that happens to contain good-sized dollops of romance and humor. Hugh Grant, as a true ne'er-do-well, lives off of royalties generated by an inane but successful Christmas song written by his father. He lives an admittedly meaningless life.  He's never worked seriously at anything, including relationships.  Then he discovers single moms ... and despite himself, begins to grow up. Saying much more about the plot does little to explain why I think this movie is a must-see; rather, let's observe that Grant shows true subtlety (rather than vacuousness as he sometimes does.) He also shows us a character we really don't like at first --- and still realize is flawed, even at the end.  But he finally learns he is 'not an island,' and the trip getting there is worth hitching up to. All others, including the boy that the title refers to (I forget his name) offer solid supporting roles, and the direction is crisp and interesting; this could have been a movie with long yawn stretches, but it kept my interest throughout. Moreover, it is a movie that discusses a very pertinent post-modernist question are we really islands?  I think you'll discover yourself pondering the movie's message for days afteward.
