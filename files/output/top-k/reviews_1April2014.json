I liked title start of the movie, that tune is still stuck in my head at the moment. The movie dose not take long to start at all, the song of 3 old men walking,(a song singing about which I thought was really clever) but then turn out not to be , who you think they are! This movie is not action packed from start to end however it dose have some great action scenes throughout the movie. Some decent car chase scenes, one car chase scenes looked a bit out dated. I liked there few turns in story, you think the story is going one way but then take a turn, I really enjoyed this twist and turns in the movie. I really enjoyed the last 20 minutes of the movie, I was hoping for longer fight scenes at end, a little disappointing with that.The acting was great from whole cast! As I thought this movie was really good, before I saw it, I did think whole movie would feel out dated but only one scene actually felt a bit out dated the rest of the movie was fine, even for today!I though this movie was really good 7 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 April 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Before today, I have never actually seen James bond movie in full before, I seen parts of some movies.

I am doing my small part to pump the rating up to a solid 9 where it belongs.I saw this on the big screen during it's opening week when I was 11 in a REAL theater - huge (holding 1075 people), packed house, spring-rocking seats, 70mm film, six track Dolby...wondrous. I have watched Alien at least 50 times since and I will never grow tired of it.The overall mood of the film is chilling and suspenseful. The detail and sheer beauty of the Nostromo's interior is stunning. I could easily watch an entire hour of slow, sweeping pans of the rooms and corridors alone. Nothing before or since has ever come close.The special effects in Alien are fantastic by any standard. Yes, there is one scene in which someone attempts to stand something upright on a table and another where something appears to be moving on a dolly that reveal some limitations, but these are more than acceptable trade-offs for the realism of makeup versus CGI. I am sure the editors wished they had a few more takes to work with, but they did their best with the shots they had and these very minor flaws do not detract.I would have thought that by now, CGI would be a match for old-fashioned silicone and makeup, but sadly no. CGI still looks fake and has never produced a single, believable, creature or superhero in all these years. Ever. I find that very sad. I don't know if it is because the technology for realism just isn't here yet or if it is simply a lack of human talent in adding in the imperfections that make things look real. I suspect it's a combination of both plus a lack of budget for the time it would take and I don't think we will see real-looking CGI for at least another 30 years. I wish more films today would shun CGI altogether. Models, silicone and makeup are far superior. Come on CGI effects teams - CATCH UP! Well, that's my rant on CGI... But although the sets and effects are wonderful, Alien is not a special effects film. It is pure suspense and horror in a sci-fi setting, done to perfection.Alright that's enough. If you are the one person alive who hasn't seen this, what are you waiting for? If sci-fi or slow suspense is not your cup of tea, so be it. It takes all kinds to make a world, but give it a shot - give it its due. Alien is truly an amazing work of art.

You know, it was on 1936 when this movie was released and it is a kind of critic for those days. Far from that era, I watch Modern Times on 2013, that's actually weird when a teenage like me curious about silent movie. But, that doesn't matter as long as the movie that I watch is a masterpiece or special feature of its time. And Charlie Chaplin, as everybody knows, is maestro for silent film era. He is funny but genius, yes, a best figure of early cinema.Modern Times is my first Charlie Chaplin's, this is important because first time watching can create a pure impression. Yes, I surprised with Chaplin's impossible yet dangerous scene like skating in the second floor. That scene really makes me thump. Every single accelerated act is honestly weird for me, but sometimes it looks funny with great acting of Charlie himself. Other peculiarity is its absurd scene, like suddenly fallen to river, enter to the heart of machine, and singing also dancing. With some touch of sentimental soul, that's just make the whole film amazing.That's only the outer part of the movie, but the soul of the film is critic for the government, or economic system, especially in the United States of America. Explicitly, you can watch the crowd in front of factory to get a job, and some kind of misjudgment in the real life. What I want to say is even the innocent and kind man like the tramp will suffer if the system is not fit. That's the 1930's America, it's also like the system of developing country nowadays. As the country develops, it meets so many problem that's make many people become a victim. The Tramp is a symbol of poor man struggle with violent world, you must work hard and smart to be the winner of your life freedom. I mean freedom of possession, prosperity, and to opine.That's a deep message that is delivered with this complex yet humble movie, Modern Times. The complication of the system translated by this single comedy film. So fun, so great, so critical. What a hilarious one!

Based on a Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, it has dominated IMDb's Top 250 list for years now and has often been regarded as one of the best films ever made. Almost every adult Westerner has seen the movie at some point during their lives, yet not all that many people talk about this film, at least in my experience. It's not often recommended to others like The Godfathers, it's not quoted as often as The Dark Knight or Fight Club, it's not regarded as inherently cool as Pulp Fiction. So what makes it so great then? In my opinion the answer lies in its quality as a whole. It's not a flashy film. The pacing is slow as time itself - fitting for a prison film, admittedly - the conversations are often quiet and thoughtful, the prison setting never changes, but rather builds up in intensity and while there are emotions and deep themes displayed, they're not over the top or hammered in. Rather they're subtle, real if you will.It's not a film that you will talk about a lot, but it's a movie that will stick with you. It's not a film that will leave you puzzled for days as you try to work through it's meanings, it's not a hard movie to understand, but you'll find yourself returning to it from time to time. And there are a lot of things to return to. The quiet dignity of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the friendship between him and Red (Morgan Freeman), the other inmates, the brutality of the warden and the guards, that brilliant moment in the rain, the ending, the callbacks, the overarching and complex plot.The Shawshank Redemption is the jack of all trades of films. Not a single element in it is the absolute best within cinema, but they're all way above average. Everything from the slightest camera angle to the main actors is up to par and beyond. Personally it's not my favourite movie of all time, I admit as much, but it's a masterpiece in its own right. I have nothing against it being the number one.

One wonders how his characters like Kevin McAlister or, in this case, Timmy Gleason fared in school, with classes like calculus, physics, and trigonometry requiring more book-smart level thinking. It's one thing to build an amateur trap; it's another being able to explain why the trap works and how it is triggered.Getting Even With Dad marked Macaulay Culkin's last project for six years before appearing in a film adaptation of the stage play Madame Melville. His downfall could be attributed to many things, but Culkin was fourteen during the time of this film, already growing out of his cute-kid appearance and becoming more of an adult, as well as Getting Even With Dad's extremely poor box office performance after the kid was proved to be a solid cash-grab with two Home Alone projects. Even with this film, Culkin shows a certain tiredness to doing the same old schtick with little reward.The film revolves around his character Timmy, whose mother died some years ago and who has been living with his aunt and her fiancée since the event. Planning to marry and get Timmy out of her hair, the aunt decides to drop Timmy off at his biological father's house, where both can meet each other and Timmy can have a place to stay. Timmy's dad turns out to be a petty-con by the name of Ray Gleason (Ted Danson), who is plotting with two amateur cronies Bobby and Carl (Saul Rubinek and Gailard Sartain) to steal a collection of rare coins. It is only obligatory that Timmy is smarter than all three of these cons put together, so when the gang actually do find the coins, he'll hide them in order to squeeze more quality time out of his father than he's willing to give (and also maybe have his hand at nudging a little romance in his direction on the side).Getting Even With Dad is the classic case of a film biting off more than it can chew. The film tries to mesh themes of crime, romance, father-and-son bonding, slapstick comedy, and sentimentalist drama all into and it barely succeeds as a film detailing father-and-son bonding. It makes not knowing your father and then coming across him when you discover he's a petty crime out to be another instance to practically laugh off rather than one to be deeply upset about. Writers Tom S. Parker and Jim Jennewein (who also wrote the other Macaulay Culkin showcase of the same year Ri¢hie Ri¢h as well Major League II) had a golden opportunity to explore the sadness and the neglect of a father not being there for his son during crucial developmental years and then not even making a good too-little-too-late effort that, I believe, kids would've responded to much more than the mashup of cheesy themes we got with the end product of Getting Even With Dad.The film was directed by Howard Deutch, who was responsible for directing both of John Hughes' screenplays Pretty in Pink and Some Kind of Wonderful as well as other products such as the charming Great Outdoors and The Odd Couple II. Deutch's directing style has never been one to praise for its uniqueness, but even in projects such as The Odd Couple II, he always seemed to manage to squeeze something out of his performers and his crew. Here, however, there's little he can do to liven a slumping screenplay with too many different themes to tackle adequately.Starring Macaulay Culkin, Ted Danson, and Glenne Headly.

While it's not as good as the first two films,The Godfather Part III is a nice conclusion to The Godfather Saga.Set twenty years after the events in Part II,The Godfather Part III depicts Michael Corleone(Al Pacino)who is now older and has finally made the Corleone Family legitimate and on the straight and narrow. But,unfortunately for Michael his past and thoughts of guilt have come back to haunt him and his enemies have lured but into the criminal world while worrying about his family including his nephew Vincent Mancini(Andy Garcia)and daughter Mary(Sofia Coppola).Released in 1990,The Godfather Part III is a sequel that despite being nominated for 7 Academy Awards and being a modest Box Office success sharply divided Godfather fans and movie critics. Some fans and movie critics felt the movie should not have been made and is a bad film compared to the first two films and disliked the casting of Sofia Coppola. Despite the film's flaws it's a really good film in my opinion and is a powerful conclusion to this great trilogy. I don't think Director Francis Coppola was trying to top the first two I think he just wanted to make a satisfying conclusion and he does so here. Francis Coppola has said that the first two films is the series and part III is the epilogue and that is very true with this film because what makes The Godfather Part III so effective is that we have seen what happen to some of the characters in the first two films and we see some of their fates which adds to the tragedy and sadness of this film because we see most of the characters haunted by their past demons and there is a sense of doom that hangs over the film and you will feel like there will be no happy outcome and Francis Coppola shows this to viewers in stylish way. The themes of violence,betrayal and death were in the first two films and it's also in Part III as well and with the Corleone family trying to distance themselves from the Gangster world but what GF III tells us is that while a person can get out of the Gangster world it never leaves any person no matter what they do. When we see the character Michael Corleone in Part III we see a man who has aged and that being the don and leader of the Corleone family has not only taken a mental toll on Michael but a physical toll as well. Where it was kind of tough to have sympathy for Michael in Part II,in this film we finally start to feel terrible for Michael because he is disturbed by his evil deeds and what he has done and realize he never wanted to be a the head of The Corleone family or be a gangster he felt like he had no choice. Throughout GF III we see Michael trying to reclaim his tortured soul that was pretty damaged after the events in Part II and it's not a sinner trying to become a saint but a man trying to bring some goodness into his life. The Godfather films are in their own way morality tales about people and the things that they do and the unfortunate consequences of people's Actions. The Godfather films are known for their violent scenes and Part III doesn't hold anything back giving viewers a few scenes that are shocking and horrific. The screenplay by Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo is good and memorable even though the script lacks the greatness of the first two films. The ending of The Godfather Part III is amazing and is one of the saddest and most heartbreaking endings in film history and no matter how many times I see the ending it still gets to me. A powerful and fitting end to The Godfather Trilogy.The cast is wonderful. Al Pacino is excellent as Michael Corleone,with Pacino bringing emotion,power and depth to role. Diane Keaton is wonderful as Kay Adams,Michael's former wife. Talia Shire is terrific as Connie Corleone,Michael's sister. Andy Garcia is outstanding as Vincent Mancini,Sonny Corleone's illegitimate son and Michael's nephew. Eli Wallach is amazing as Don Atobello,an old-time Gangster. Joe Mantegna is great and clever as Joey Zasa,a smooth talking Gangster. Sophia Coppola does an O.K job as Mary Corleone and is not as bad as everyone says. Richard bright is sensational as Al Neri,Michael's old bodyguard. Bridget Fonda(Grace Hamilton),George Hamilton(B.J Harrison)Donal Donnelly(Archbishop Gilday)and Franc D'Ambrosio(Anthony Vito Corleone) give good performances as well.The direction Francis Coppola is fantastic and stylish,with Coppola a beautiful and amazing visual style to the film. Great direction,Coppola.The score by Carmine Coppola is wonderful,epic and matches the tone of the film. Outstanding score,Carmine.In final word,if you love Francis Coppola,the first two Godfather films,Gangster Films or Crime Dramas,I highly suggest you see The Godfather Part III,a wonderful,underrated sequel that deserves a second chance.

Russell Crowe is one of top 10 actors in the world, and his great act in this movie make audience a lot of emotional feeling. even at the end of that make me cry... Gladiator features some wonderful cinematography by John Mathieson. The battle scenes are very graphic. There were some scenes in particular that really struck me, such as when Crowe appears to be floating over the ground very fast.

The best western i have ever seen. A three hour journey of excitement that leads you to the long awaited and explosive climax. I can honestly say that the last twenty minutes or so of this film is the best twenty minutes of film i have ever seen. Absolutely phenomenal. Sergio Leone's directing with the three leading actors makes this one of the best films i have ever seen... Perhaps the best. Actually yes, this is my favorite movie of all time and i don't see that ever changing.What makes 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly' iconic ranges from many things such as Ennio Morricone's memorable score not only defining this movie, but spaghetti westerns, to its unforgettable scenes, depicting beauty and grit in the world created by Sergio Leone. Watching the movie feels like listening to a long musical composition, watching it build and build into a heart pounding crescendo, at the same time basking in the scenes where time feels like it slows down so we could soak in the beauty that this ugly, fragile world has to offer.What I love about this film, is how it can be light-hearted and fun, yet still feel deep, heavy and contemplative at times. We don't get to know the characters at all (except a bit about Tuco), but we get to know them through their actions, and we truly find out the nature of why these three characters have these titles of 'the good,' 'the bad,' and 'the ugly.' To see these characters interact is a treat to watch, but what captivated me about the film was the great Clint Eastwood and his performance at 'The Man with no Name' or 'Blondie' as Tuco would address him as. He is the definitive embodiment of the stoic, anti-hero with an air of mystery as to where he comes from and his motives, which is what kept me in suspense through out the movie. From his strategic thinking in outsmarting Tuco, he is basically floating through a world of chaos, adapting to any unexpected messy situation these characters get thrown into. Then, when we finally get to the ending, we don't know what will become of the characters and that unpredictability is what makes this one moment in the movie one of the most intense scenes in cinema. Without spoiling anything, all I could say is that I felt the ending was clever in a way I didn't see coming at all.With a great setting, a great score, great performances and a simple, but very great story, this is a western film I highly recommend you should watch, if you have never watched any westerns before. On that note, this is not only a great western film, but a wonderful piece of art from Sergio Leone. From the films I've watched by him, everyone of those films possess that layer of depth to them that feels like that feeling of bliss in life that comes once in a blue moon. Even with a film as dark as 'Once Upon a Time in the West' or 'Once Upon a Time in America,' Leone still manages to emit a feeling of warmth through his stories, and with all its guns and grit, 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' is pure beauty on film.

They make the whole story, and the idea of Rebecca is so strong it's like she's there as a fully formed character.

They also share working together in dodgy business activities, and are both attracted to the beautiful actress Natalija (Mirjana Jokovic), but of course the dark days of World War II come upon them, they and many other villagers are forced to take cover and go into refuge in an underground shelter. In the underground are a variety of weapons, and all the townspeople can do, as the bombs fall and the fighting goes on up above, is work together to protect, and in some cases, provide these weapons to the forces up above. Years pass and the war does eventually come to an end, but with the work progressing so well below Marko and Natalija decide to keep the momentum by making the people believe that the war is still going on, they achieve this playing sound effect recordings from previous noisy incidents. This deception continues from the end of World War II all the way to the beginnings of both the Cold War and the Yugoslav Wars, but Blacky realises the actions of Marko and Natalija, he orders them both be executed for making money both for taking advantage of innocent and vulnerable lives and for making their money with the weapons manufacturing, in the end all surviving townspeople reunite at a wedding.

The music is pretty stupid now but I have to admit as a child of the eighties who heard the soundtrack on the radios and when friends played it on -- GASP -- cassette tapes at each other's houses and at school, so of them were good songs. At least songs you can listen to without puking.Patrick Swayze looks so young in this and he's really good in his part, and so is Jennifer Gray. Not sure why she got surgery to change her nose, she looks great in this and Ferris Bueller. A very pretty girl who is good in this and could also do comedy.Have to say though the whole age difference thing is pretty creepy, what is she in this like 16? And he's in his thirties? Ewwwwwww!

They add fun and entertainment to liven up a very dull party. April 1st is known to the world as April Fool's Day. In this movie, you have 9 friends from college going out to Spring Break on a island mansion. As everyone is getting ready for the getaway, disaster strikes. First, the ferry hand has a mishap roping in to dock the ferry. At the mansion, the soon to be heir Muffy(Deborah Foreman) has set up the place with some jokes of her own. The guests get a few laughs in the beginning, but things get a little more intense. One by one, the guest disappear. They either go missing, or worse, dead. With no way to contact anyone on the main land, the survivors take action. Seeing all the severed head in a well, things get really scary. With the last couple left, they make their last efforts to survive. All of a sudden, everyone in the mansion are all right! What's going on? It turned out that some of the guests were part of the joke. APRIL FOOL'S DAY!!!! So there's no slasher in the film, the whole thing is a joke.

I've heard of this movie for so long but never intrigued by the signal-blazing poster and preaching-sound plot. But then I watched it by default and become so angry that compelled myself to rant out my rage. Its rub*ish, don't sully your eyes by it.Honestly, every character is black and white. Long overdue prodigal son who used to be a loving a caring straight A student got lectured by his racist old man and SUDDENLY abandon all his DOUBLE PHD black teacher's words and starting to mutter extreme racist remarks on news report when his honest hardworking firefighter dad got shot and killed. Then unsurprisingly he was claimed to be brainwashed and apparently become the rabbis of his secret guild. And his uncontrollable ANGER(so symbolic and repetitively accentuated in the movie that you started doubting if the director thinks the audience are all eight year old) moved to his family, to defend his belief and stand out for his horrendous looking lady friend. he even stuffed a chunk of beef into his sister's mouth to shut her up. AND he killed the guys who tried to sneaked his car through the most thrilling way(I didn't know if you put mouth on curbs and kick it could kill a man). I'm flabbergasted how the storyline goes exactly as I predicted(I learned in primary school if you want to salute a kind of concept you first suppressed it and then through a heavenly epiphany you realized the folly of you and the mightiness of the concept, say the virtue of be punctual), I thought maybe deviated a little from the standard via but sadly, sadly it doesn't. the linchpin of the movie got his second life and love education behind bars by his fellow linen worker and a f*ck in the a*s.Every character is either purely good or evil, all deprived of sanity and love and proper education. The fat bug killer is a racist for a reason, he simply is insolent and grumpy as hell about his life, he eats jelly beans with a bow; the mason-vision gangster are dramatized and demonized to present the very extremity of racism, which itself desensitize the audience and shift the concept of racism to terrorism. Apparently the director itself is undereducated but ridiculously bold to produce a film regarding racism without do much research about the itself. You'd startled by the level of superficiality and phoniness of the film. They even spent 3 mins on a black versus white basketball game.yeah.
