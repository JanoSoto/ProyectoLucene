Guns, knives, bombs, chases, beatings, this is why films were invented! Jim Rambo returns again in this first sequel to the first film First Blood. Rambo has been sent to prison after his escapades in the previous film, but he is happy there as no-one annoys him. When General Kirby (based on the 'popular' Nintendy character) comes a knockin, we know Rambo will help and the fun will begin. This film has many much more excitement sections than the first film, tones more fights, loads more action, and proves that sequels can be better than prequels.A bunch of soldiers are believed to be still held captive in the woods of Vietnam. Charles has them. There is no proof however, so Brian Dennhardy and the guy from Karate Kid decide to get the proof. They don't want to dirty their own clothes though, so they tell Kirby to send in Rambo. Rambo believes he is going in to save his fellow psychos, but really he is a guinea hamster and the bosses have no intention of saving the men. Rambo is dropped in front of enemy lines with his trusty knife and has to find the men in 2 days or be left behind. Joining him is a pretty local woman who he falls in love with. This twist makes Rambo one of the most romantic films ever, as well as one of the most action packed. Of course their relationship is tragic, and when something bad happens I wanted to jump into the TV and scream 'NOOO!' and start shooting all the bad guys, including the good guys. The film also shows that you can never trust your bosses because they just want to leave you in the jungle. The main bad guy is so evil that it really feels great when Rambo gets him. Yeah, take that you scumbag! There are lots of good one liners in this film, like when the bad guy is going to poke Rambo's eye out he says 'I must break you' and Rambo simply says 'Go For It!' before snapping his neck. 'What mean expendable?' the girl asks. 'It like when I is invited to a party, and there is beer and I drink some beer, and then I drink another beer, and then I drink lots of beers and make a silly of myself but no-one cares. That mean expendable.' That one line pretty much sums up America's involvement in Vietnam for me.All the clever college stuff aside, what we really care is the action. How about these? Rambo infiltrates the bad guys' hideout, and slices 10 guards' necks. He is captured and electrocuted, but still manages to destroy everyone and escape with his bare hands. His canoe is attacked with machine guns and rocket launchers and he has to kill all the bad guys and jump out before it explodes. He steals a Helichopter and blows away hundreds of bad guys! He chases the main bad guy around the forest with a bow and arrow while nukes are dropped around him! Yes, this is a truly awesome film which all true movie fans need to see.Best Scene When Rambo returns to his base and searches for the bad American guys. He shoots all the computers and screams and says a big speech like the first film. Stallion's acting here is superb as you don't know what he is saying and should have won an Oscar.

I'm not really sure why, because people close to me kept saying it's a great film and that I should watch it right away.And so I finally watched it yesterday.The movie is confusing, to say the least. The first 3 minutes are completely dark, with a strange sound that reappears throughout the movie.We then switch to a prehistoric planet, where apes and other animals are the (so it seems) only inhabitants. We see how they slowly, yet surely become smarter and learn some primitive techniques. Ironic enough, the scene ends when an ape kills another one using a bone. I guess the movie wants to tell us that violence is bad? But it is a sad and painful aspect of the (future) human race...The next story is about a research center (of some sorts) in outer space where a computer, called HAL, operates the whole mission. The research center is going towards Jupiter. The reason is explained in the movie, but it slips my mind as I am writing this. At some point, the computer malfunctions and things go bad.The final, and most confusing, story is basically a journey into the unknown. You could say that the 'odyssey' part of the movie applies to this last bit. For almost 15 minutes we, the viewers, are exposed to a colorful collection of lights, beams and shapes. At the end of it all, we see one man age in a single, isolated room. In the end, he returns as a fetus, as we see him float above the Earth.The black monolith, symbolizing evolution (I think), appears in all of these stories. There's probably a deep, philosophical explanation to it all, but I didn't get most of it.I'm sure this movie is an icon of it's time and yes, it is sometimes well-written and cleverly put together.

I felt bad for her after everybody found out her private thoughts and hated her for it. Sometimes kids can be relentless. I felt worse when the kids became spy catchers and interfered with her spying, including her own friends Sport and Janie. I also cannot believe they went and got blue paint all over her. I knew after that bitch Marion poured paint in her hair and got slapped in the face for it, that was going to be it. Harriet wasn't lying when she told them she was going to get them real bad, and she did. As I watched her get back at the kids that did cruel things to her, I was cracking up, especially when Laura got nailed by an unexpected haircut. Too bad for Beth's pictures she posted. Harriet vandalized them. Time to throw them away. When Carrie was looking for her bra, it wasn't pretty when she realized that bra Harriet put on a pole was hers. And look how bad Pinky and Janie's projects turned out after Harriet tampered with them. Mostly, I felt worse for Marion and Sport when Harriet said something false about her father to Marion to make her cry like crazy and when Harriet humiliated Sport in front of the whole school by posting an embarrassing picture of him. He was so broken hearted. that was going way too far and was really low even for her. Not just her, all of them. Well, I am glad Harriet's nanny, Golly, gave her advice on what to do.

They are both fine actors but Brosman lacks the image of a selfish man, and Russo is not a slut actress. Both of their strengths are class and intelligence. Now picture this flick with, oh, say, Val Kilmer and Angelina Jolie. THAT would be fireworks. Here, it's just pathetic to see such fine human beings cast as take what you can types. It just don't work, folks.I agree with others who point out the silliness of the plot. But it is hard for me to even consider the plot when I see Russo (or whoever) writhing all over a marble staircase. And what's with that obscene statue in the front hall of Crown's home? Please...is a guy into Monet also into in-your-face pornographic figures? Let's talk class here...at least that marble babe shouldn't be spread eagled in front of incoming guests. And what's with the pouty-faced model cast as the daughter of somebody or other in prison? Her smoldering looks and slinking on and off camera are hilarious. Yeah, like she's able to recreate the soul of Monet; she can't even crack a smile. She looks like a blond Dementor.Hey- I just had a thought I continue to nominate another sequal, Lost Horizon as the worst film ever made. BUT if the same crew who hatched that singing turkey really wanted to nail the title, why don't they put this Thomas Crown Affair to music! That would be the best thing since talkies.

However, even judging it from the strictest critical eye, Dream Warriors is a worthy successor to the brilliant original, and it certainly has the distinction of being the best sequel of the series that retains Elm Street in its title.Granted, there isn't a whole lot of competition on that front. While the concept of a maniacal killer who stalks you in your dreams was, and remains, a truly frightening and original punchline for a horror film, it's amazing how many atrocities were done with this powerful concept, as the Nightmare On Elm Street franchise is overall the worst extended horror film series of all time. While horror lore paints Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers, Leatherface, and Pinhead as modern successors to the Dracula, Frankenstein, Wolf Man, and Creature From The Black Lagoon rogues gallery of horror's classic past, Freddy's contributions are by far the most lackluster of the bunch. While the original Nightmare is a certified classic in its own right, the downward slide the series started right after it was only interrupted by Dream Warriors, and to a lesser extent, its follow-up, Part 4 The Dream Master. This duo was followed by a Part 5 that offered very little in the way of notable legacy enhancement, and this was in turn followed by Freddy's Dead, which is a largely unwatchable and pathetic embarrassment to the character. Though Freddy would be re-imagined to fantastic effect with Wes Craven's New Nightmare, which is by far the best true sequel to the original Elm Street (the fun and goofily awesome Freddy Vs. Jason notwithstanding), the Nightmare On Elm Street series boasts almost no sustainability as a franchise. Even though there have been subpar raisings of Hell, unmemorable Friday The 13ths, and massacres of Texas Chainsaws, Nightmare On Elm Street remains perhaps the most problematic horror franchise of all time, simply because so little justice was done to an original concept that seemed to promise so much.But, I'm not here to review the series (although I'm sure I'll get around to each installment before too long). Even ignoring the wretched tripe that followed it, Dream Warriors holds up as a creative and well-executed Freddy tale, and had the film-makers followed the intriguing concept of individuals having powers in the world of their dreams to combat Freddy with, chances are, we would have gotten sequels with much more punch than what stands on the record. Kids with dream powers are certainly a more worthy foil for Freddy than dreaming babies, terrible 3-D effects, and Roseanne Barr cameos.As it stands, not much is done with the idea here, either. We only get a few short glimpses at the powers hinted at in the film, and seeing how quickly a pre-dating Harry Potter wannabe and a Suicide Girls cast-away get thwarted by Freddy, these special abilities are rendered a bit mediocre.But, for pure visual and visceral panache, Elm Street 3 packs more into its 90-minutes than any other film in the series. The film is almost an homage to special effects, utilizing every trick available at the time, and resurrecting ones that were seldom used in the era. The straight-up splatter is augmented with claymation effects, stop-motion animation, puppetry, and even pure camera tricks. Though Part 4 would employ all of these elements to even more fantastic effect, Dream Warriors maintains a darkness that keeps it true to its horrific centerpiece, while the films that followed continued to explore the fantasy-based elements of the character.Some of the sequences still pack an indelible punch today, and I defy anyone not to cringe at the sleepwalking sequence. I have a friend who will not let anyone touch her wrists, and she told me this phobia stems directly from this scene. The neglect of an erogenous zone because it brings about thoughts of Freddy is certainly a powerful statement about the impact of a well-executed scare.Having Heather Langenkamp and John Saxon back in the fold certainly helps things along, and the great performance from a young Patricia Arquette and equally strong turns from her peers in the film add some credibility to the teens vs. adults crux of the story. And, while Freddy certainly has his wise-cracks here, they aren't as over the top or prevalent as those we'd find in future installments. Here, he doesn't make a quip every 10 seconds, and when he does, most of the lines are witty and morbid enough to enhance, rather than detract from, the brutality.As previously stated, it's a real shame that the series didn't progress forward in the direction hinted at here. For sure, we would have had future installments that were more scary than silly, and the Freddy character might have maintained what little menace he had left when Dream Warriors came out. A subsequent film that centered itself around the idea of actual Dream Warriors, with complementary dream powers that were fully developed and explored, certainly couldn't have been worse than what we ended up getting.In the end, Dream Warriors remains a brief ray of light in a series that degenerated into nauseating disappointment. For that, it certainly deserves notice, and those who never revisited this chapter because of the sour taste left by The Dream Child and Freddy's Dead should give this outing another shot. We'll see how much life Freddy has left in him, but if his legacy has already been largely carved, Dream Warriors deserves to be mentioned on the tombstone.

Everyone knows Arnie is the greetest Acting Star ever and everyone one of his films (except don't throw mummy off the train) is a classic. Based on a Steve Kingsly album this film sees Arnie entered into a popular game in the future. Blockbusters? Nope. This game is of life and death, and of running and fighting. The contestants (including Arnie's girlfriend Amber and two of his mates) are claimed to be criminals, and the game show is designed as punishment for criminals. They have to enter an underground city and get from one end to the other without being killed, but there are lots of obstacles in their way, such as Skipping Stones, Single Roller, and Bridge Ball. As well as these there are gladiators chasing them- skilled fighters with special powers- one is a tough ice hockey player, one shoots fire, one shoots lightening etc. Normally this would be a good way to treat criminals, and teach them not to steal groceries anymore, but we know that Arnie et al have been framed. There is lots of action. There is lots of humour Mic Mr. Spock, you have the com. Underground Tech Ay aye, Lord Vader.And lots of classic Arnie one liners such as Ben Richards Killian, here's Subzero, now nothing but a lifeless body. Like a snowman. Heh heh.AndAmber (after Richards cut Buzzsaw in half with a chain saw) What happened to Buzzsaw? Ben Richards He half to go away!And of courseBen Richards (after strangling Sub-Zero with barbed wire) Every rose has its thorn!Not forgettingBen Richards (trying to get Dynamo's attention) Hey, Lighthead! Hey, Christmas Tree! Yeah, you! Come here so I can turn you on!A highlight of the film is the relationship between Arnie's character and Amber. At first they are enemies, quippingAmber I warn you I get sick. Car sick, air sick. And I'm going to throw up all over you. Richards You wouldn't dare. Just remember, I can break your neck like an Irishman's.But afterwards they fall for each other reluctantlyAmber They think I'm your girlfriend. Ben Richards Well, um, you could be. The camera can't see round that corner. Wanna feel the Austrian Oak? Amber OOOH MATRON!Arnie also quips with the lead bad guy- the game show host (played by Roy Walker) throughout the film. Before the game beginsBen Richards Killian! I'll be back! Damon Killian Sorry, your microphone isn't working. During the gameBen Richards You're gonna eat that contract, but I hope you leave enough room for my fist because I'm going to ram it into your stomach! Then, I'm gonna feed you bag after bag of money, cos that's all you love, and when you start dumping out quarters sideways, I'm gonna be in the toilet with you, laughing!And after the gameDamon Killian I'll have a gun please, Bob. Ben Richards I don't do requests.Indeed, with all this classic dialogue from Arnie the rest of the cast may feel neglected. The script writers were clever though and let the rest of the cast have some dialogue which is worthy of being in ShakespeareAmber They're running men. Last season's winners. Fireball Yeah. They wasted their money on an orgy of crack. 12 hours later all that was left were 2 shrivelled, mangled corpses. Funny huh?AndLaughlin I'm going somewhere, but not with you. Buzzsaw took care of my travelling arrangements. Ben Must be Disneyland. I'm still banned after that incident with Sleeping Beauty.AndDamon Killian What's the matter? Steroids make you deaf? Sven WHAT!? I CANT HEAR YOU!The rest of the cast are pretty good in their roles, from Arnie's mates to the sweet assortment of goons. They make the film incredibly realistic and make you wish the future would hurry up so that you could watch this game every Saturday night on TV. If I was in the game I would hide until I found a machine gun, and then shoot my way out. No one would get me as I have over a year's experience in the Armed Forces and frequently spend my days working out survival tactics, inventing booby traps and creating scenarios where I am trapped in space or surrounded by bad guys and have to escape.

For the most part, terrorists functioned as masses of bad guys for the hero to blow away in any number of ways. The Devil's Own, a thriller heavily involving IRA terrorism, was made in 1997. Most likely this film wouldn't have been made post-9\/11, and certainly not in the manner in which director Alan J. Pakula made it.Frankie McGuire (Brad Pitt) is a notorious IRA terrorist who has been assigned to go to the US to pick up some stinger missiles. While there, he is staying with a family man (who also happens to be a cop) named Tom O'Meara (Harrison Ford). But Frankie runs into trouble with the gunrunner he's buying the missiles from (Treat Williams), putting both the lives of Frankie and Tom & his family in jeopardy.The acting is solid. Harrison Ford has a pretty limited range, but when he's playing a role within that narrow window, he can be very effective. Tom O'Meara is not a complex part, and Ford is up to the task. There are certain similarities between Tom and President James Marshall from Air Force One, but never mind. I've never been a Brad Pitt fan, but I have to admit, he has more talent than just being able to keep the tabloids salivating over his every move. Frankie (known to Tom and his family as Rory Devaney) is a charming, handsome man, but he's not against showing his brutal nature when the situation arises. He's a nice guy, but he's also very dangerous; Pitt never lets us forget that. Treat Williams is miscast as Billy Burke, the gunrunner. He tries to bring menace to the character by being one of those pleasant villains (the kind who mask their capacatiy for violence with an easygoing attitude). However, Williams isn't able to exude much menace this way. Ruben Blades is unmemorable as Diaz, Tom's partner, but Natasha McElhone is terrific as Frankie's contact, Megan.The Devil's Own was the last film by Alan J. Pakula before he was killed in a tragic road accident. Pakula does does a solid job, although I have to question his handling of Frankie in the beginning. I've read some user reviews that claim that the film portrays IRA terrorists in a positive light, and doesn't do justice to the conflict. While I wouldn't go that far, I find some scenes rather unsettling because of concerns similar to this. Some of the scenes where Frankie and his cohort, Sean (Paul Ronan) are working on delivering the missiles are taken lightly, and are rather playful. This doesn't necessarily hurt the film (it builds sympathy for the character), but I think it was unwise to handle them in this way.For a mainstream thriller, The Devil's Own is not as formulaic as one might think (save for the ending).

He also has the help of his eldest son, Michael Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin). It begins with Michael Jr. finding out his father kills people for a living by witnessing it with his own eyes. The trust between them is put on the line. When their family is killed, they have to stick together to survive, one can not live without the other.I found this film extremely boring to begin with, but I told my self to stick with it even though I was finding it hard to concentrate on it. About an hour and a half into the movie, it begins to pick up when Michael Sullivan is telling his son how to drive a car. It is a comical scene which made me realise I know nothing about cars. The scenes which involve death are shocking, but are not brutally violent, which makes the film different. When the gunshots go off, it doesn't make you jump, there is a soft tone about this film. This is probably brought about by the amazing cinematography; every shot could be a photograph. This also fits in with Jude Law's character that shoots photographs of the dead. He has been hired to assassinate Michael Sullivan and Jude Law gives this character a creepy feel, he does wrong things and yet he makes you feel sort of happy about it. The final scenes are amazing. It has a shock dramatic ending, but you don't feel sad for losing a main character. You feel a joy of relief because any resentment Michael Sullivan Jr. had for his father is lifted when he forgives his father for what he did for a living and realises he is nothing like him and will not become him.The acting in the film was amazing, there is a whole cast of fantastic actors. However, Daniel Craig's character I found weird and Paul Newman's character didn't interest me in the slightest, which let their acting abilities be not known. I felt Tom Hank's performance was a little disappointing at the beginning of the film, when his wife had died, I thought it lacked real emotion. However, as the movie progressed, so did his acting talent. Jude Law was fantastic and Tyler Hoechlin was OK, but nothing special.The direction of Sam Mendes is great and the cinematography of the film is the best thing.

Yes it has Romance and yes it is the the driving force behind the film's conclusion, but for the most part the film's narrative doesn't concentrate on this romance. Instead this is a film about how Phil(Bill Murray), and i hate to be clichéd, discovers himself. This is why i would be inclined to call Groundhog day a comedy.On to the review. Honestly when i look at comedy films i don't take into account it's 'artistic' merit, e.g. the direction or cinematography. Instead i find that when watching comedy films the plot and jokes should be the main focus.Groudhog Day's success mainly comes down to two factors, the first is it's plot. Being a completely inspired idea it would have been very hard to make a film that wasn't funny. The execution however was perfect which managed to harvest every bit of humour it could from the situation Phil is put into.The second reason for the success of the film can be put down to the brilliance of the acting, in particular in reference to Bill Murray, who is on better form than ever (and that is a high standard). Thanks to Murray i found myself connecting to the character like never before in a comedy, adding to the effect of the humour.Overall Grounhog day is an almost perfect film which fractionally misses out on the title of best comedy ever.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"30 June 2009","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Up until now Groundhog Day was one of the few films in IMDb's top 250 that i hadn't had the pleasure of watching, mainly due to the fact that it is often perceived to belong in the Rom-com genre.
