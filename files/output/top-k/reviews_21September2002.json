Sebastion is figure all men with they could ascribe to he gains the interest of the females around him with ease, and yet is neither a sports star, nor a serious student. He does not need any special skills other than his unbridled charm and his love-making abilities. Sebastion makes a bet with Kathryn concerning Annette, but eventually, he falls in love with her.Initially, he is consumed with lust for his beautiful stepsister Kathryn, a woman who is socially conscious and whose reputation is of utmost importance. Sara Michelle Gellar adds a level of depth to the character that is unsurpassable by any other actress. Kathryn uses Sebastion to ruin the reputations of her competition, and finally makes a bet with Sebastion if he will make love to the headmasters daughter before school starts, she will make love to him. However, as Sebastion inevitably falls in love with Annette, Kathryn grows jealous, and uses Sebastion's anxieties to steal him from Annette.Reese Witherspoon plays Annette, the beautiful virgin whose idealistic notions are simply justification for her reluctance to give her body to another. Sadly, though Reese Witherspoon does a superb job of portraying her character, she does not have the looks, nor is her character developed enough, that one could honestly believe Sebastion would give up his reckless pursuit of sex for her. In all honesty, the girl who portrays Clarissa would have done a better job, and she was only seen for about 1 minute.Though Cruel Intentions, like American Beauty and Eyes Wide Shut, is portrayed as being nothing more than a film about sex, it actually concerns reputations, and what others think of you.

A killer soundtrack only serves to heighten the intensity of the brilliantly shot scenes (this is very clear when the Counting Crows song I am ready is played while Annette rides the escalator up and she and Sebastion are the only ones wearing colored garments other than browns and drab.

I really think that those who wrote those reviews missed the point.1)  There ARE stereotypes in this movie.  It's intentional.  Not every white character in this movie is portrayed as a skinhead, as some reviewers may have lead you to believe.  Not every black character in this movie is portrayed as a victim either.  In order for people to overcome racial stereotypes, we have to at least take a good look at what other races see when they look at us, and this movie does a good job of that.  There are also characters (both black and white) who try to persuade Omar Epps' character to not use his race as an excuse to play the victim, so I really don't see this movie as one sided.2)  The rape scene, where some reviewers complain that Kristy Swanson's character gave consent, wasn't supposed to be a clear cut, awful drunk bad-guy rape.  In order for people to understand the causes and effects of date rape, we need to take a closer look at where the line is between right and wrong, and this movie does a good job of asking the viewer where that line is.There are other situations where characters choose violence and revenge rather than thinking of a better solution.  But - some of these situations seem justified, and others do not.  Once again, you as the viewer have to decide if what you're seeing is right or wrong.I must admit that I was troubled by the portrayal of the campus security as being overly suspicious of blacks, and overly sympathetic towards whites.  But this movie is meant to ask questions; not suggest that ALL white security guards are this way.  The fact that I am troubled by this portrayal means that I was forced to think about what suspicions are justified, and which are not.  This movie is full of things that make you take a stand one way or another.  It's not meant to make you feel comfortable, or to decide for you...If you like movies that overtly tell you what you're supposed to think, you may misinterpret this movie.  But if you want to see thought-provoking film that will make you ask yourself a lot of questions on where you stand, I recommend seeing this film.  Great performances by Epps, Swanson, and Michael Rappaport.  I was even pleasantly surprised by Tyra Banks performance.  8 out of 10 stars.

I really think that those who wrote those reviews missed the point.1)  There ARE stereotypes in this movie.  It's intentional.  Not every white character in this movie is portrayed as a skinhead, as some reviewers may have lead you to believe.  Not every black character in this movie is portrayed as a victim either.  In order for people to overcome racial stereotypes, we have to at least take a good look at what other races see when they look at us, and this movie does a good job of that.  There are also characters (both black and white) who try to persuade Omar Epps' character to not use his race as an excuse to play the victim, so I really don't see this movie as one sided.2)  The rape scene, where some reviewers complain that Kristy Swanson's character gave consent, wasn't supposed to be a clear cut, awful drunk bad-guy rape.  In order for people to understand the causes and effects of date rape, we need to take a closer look at where the line is between right and wrong, and this movie does a good job of asking the viewer where that line is.There are other situations where characters choose violence and revenge rather than thinking of a better solution.

Based on Robert Crumb's groundbreaking underground comic, the film was the first of its' kind to receive an X rating from the MPAA. In those days, an X rating was NOT a kiss of death at the box office and audiences flocked, making this a smash hit. Watching this 30 years later, I can't imagine what the fuss was about.Perhaps it is my handicap that I have read the comics. I cannot see this film in any other light. Bakshi has taken Fritz-an oversexed, cool and hip character-and transplanted him into a story so sour, dark, pointless and hopelessly dated that watching this film becomes a chore. There are some moments that suggest the spirit of Crumb, but they are over much too soon.Bakshi tries to paint a portrait of 60's America and what was wrong with it. Some of it does hit home- particularly the unrest between African-Americans and the police. But Bakshi never settles on the right tone for his film. Is it a raunchy sex comedy or a biting political drama? It doesn't succeed on either level.Certainly not as a raunchy sex comedy. For an X rated movie, this is very mild. If you are looking for any kind of raunchy, erotic experience, you might as well go on. Whatever sex scenes this movie has doesn't last long and is mostly disturbing and joyless. There is a plethora of street language and drug use in FRITZ THE CAT. I have nothing against strong language or drug use in a film.

More like a collection of scenes than a 2 hour film.The characters, despite being played well, were all devoid of any interest whatsoever. Consequently you never felt any liking for them & never really gave a toss what would happen to them. Mel's flashbacks served more as an irritation, with the boy I was never assured of his role as to whether he was your typical brainy geek or or someone a bit dim, and yet again the young girl seemed to play a role and speak in the manner of someone far older than herself. The rest of their behaviour & the other characters were academic & largely irrelevant. So much of the characters seemed cliched and flogged to death in previous films.Some of the time I felt like I was watching a remake of ideas and a plot that I'd seen before, but then each time it seemed like a new idea may introduce itself it came over as ridiculous. Aliens that could leap over a roof and with technology to travel the world, but not able to get out of a kitchen or through a door with a plank of wood nailed to it. And the water? what was that all about, they come to earth with nothing to defend themselves from the earths inhabitants or from the rain or water that covers 4\/5 of the planet.A few commenters have claimed the film to be funny. Unless it is through laughing at ideas like those above and not with them, then I must have been watching a different film. The cinema was reasonable full but there was not a single hint of laughter from anyone from start to finish.I feel a bit sorry for the director though. His two main works prior to this have both revolved around a 'twist' to shock the viewer, so people come to expect it in this. Even those who enjoyed Signs, surely cannot claim there was any sort of twist in this. To me, it all passed without a moment of interest or shock and at no point had anything to keep the viewer guessing, asking questions to themselves or surprised, and consequently nothing really happened.2\/10 (1 for the location & 1 because it's better then any of the Robin Askwith films that occupy all my 1\/10's)  ","genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"21 September 2002","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  This is a very flat-footed, plodding romantic comedy that just has no pace or spark whatsoever.

It's a clever little film, filled with great dialogue (Don't be vulgar, Jean. Let us be crooked, but never common.) and eccentric characters, from the leading lady Jean (a marvellous Barbara Stanwyck) and her much-beleaguered main man Charlie Pike (Henry Fonda) down to the other con artists that make up Jean's circle, including her dad Harry (Charles Coburn), sidekick Gerald (Melville Cooper) and Sir Alfred McGlennan Keith (Eric Blore)... or just Pearlie for short. Charlie is heir to the Pike Ale fortune, and while on a cruise home from South America, Harrington father and daughter decide to take the hapless lad to the metaphorical drycleaners. What neither of them gambles on is a romance that was always in the cards for Jean and Charlie. But just as Jean is about to go 'straight' for Charlie, he discovers that his girlfriend is part of a con racket, and unceremoniously dumps her. Hurt and determined to get revenge for his cruel parting words, Jean initiates a farce as the Lady Eve Sidwich of the film's title and infiltrates Charlie's home and heart again. She quickly teaches him a lesson he'll never forget, just as she realises how much she really still loves Charlie.Story-wise, then, it's no doubt that THE LADY EVE provides fine frothy entertainment. Pair that with the surreal touches added into the film by Preston Sturges (take for example the supposedly climactic scene in which Charlie repeats his words of love to Eve--Fonda never gets to play the scene straight, even though he has to maintain a stony face as his horse keeps butting into his speech... presumably to try to get him to stop talking!), and there's certainly plenty to keep one occupied as is. The film is, of course, a screwball comedy absolutely bent on throwing every possible obstacle it can into the path of its intended couple, coming up with more twists than you expect... However, thanks largely to the brilliant writing and direction provided by Sturges, it actually also plays very close and very insightfully to the theme of what Stanley Cavell calls 'remarriage comedy'. The idea behind this is that legal or religious marriages, the 'first' marriages of the couple concerned in such comedies, are actually sham marriages. It isn't saying 'I do' or signing a piece of paper that makes a marriage a marriage; it's the behaviour of the couple, their own endorsement, that makes it a true marriage. This theme is reflected in, for example, THE AWFUL TRUTH, which sees Lucy and Jerry Warriner divorcing (their first, sham marriage didn't work out) but getting back together again for a true, albeit not yet legalised, union. The same theme pervades THE PHILADELPHIA STORY. Preston Sturges very skilfully and effectively--but subtly!--brings this theme to his film as well. Eve and Charlie are married, but it is only when Charlie asks Jean for forgiveness and vice versa is it possible for the fact that they are married (to each other, as poor Charlie does not know!) to become significant and actually positively affirmed.This isn't the only interesting point the film makes while appearing to be little more than a fluffy piece of entertainment--when Charlie breaks Jean's heart, she tells him, The best girls aren't as good as you think they are and the bad ones aren't as bad. Not nearly as bad. She sets out to prove this, both in her fabricated 'good-girl' persona as Eve (later revealed to have had many MANY suitors) and her real 'bad-girl' con-artist self Jean (who has a soft heart and a love for Charlie that proves to be one of her virtues). Practically everyone in the film has (at least) two names by which they're known Jean\/Eve, Charlie\/Hopsie, Muggsy\/Murgatroyd\/Ambrose, Harry\/Colonel Harrington, Pearlie\/Sir Alfred and so on. This suggests, quite rightly, that people are complicated complex beings, and that appearances often have nothing to do with reality. It also brings the film's story to a head--Jean and Charlie can never be happy together until Charlie can accept Jean as she is, and this he presumably will have learnt through his short, disastrous 'marriage' to Eve.Stanwyck and Fonda are really outstanding in this film. Stanwyck's job is to persuasively depict two characters, and then effect a blend of the two of them in the final minutes of the story, and she pulls off both the sassy, confident Jean and the elegant, British Eve perfectly. It's not hard to imagine Charlie falling hard for Jean, even with her hard-headed casing of the joint and her prospective competition (appropriately deemed second-rate) for his affections... a very memorable scene involving her make-up mirror and a narrative voice-over, the latter of which is used to great effect in the lead-up to the 'romantic scene and horse' bit which follows later in the film. Fonda has the apparently easier job of appearing mostly colourless and stodgy as he spends most of his screen time reacting to situations created by both Jean and Eve, but I contend that it must really take quite a lot of true acting ability to execute the pratfalls that he does without making Charlie such a wimp that you can't imagine Jean still wanting him at the very end. Though not quite as effective as Cary Grant, who has to do the same thing in the face of Katharine Hepburn's breathlessly effusive Susan Vance in BRINGING UP BABY, Fonda still brings a sweet charm to his role as the not-at-all-slick, often befuddled Charlie Pike. Add these two classy performances to that given by the able supporting cast, and THE LADY EVE is not just well-scripted and directed, but also very very well-acted indeed.So, watch this film the first time just for fun--be charmed by the characters, by the dialogue, by the actors, by everything. Then watch it again to realise just how subtly and effectively THE LADY EVE actually makes several comments on marriage and on love. I highly recommend getting your hands on the Criterion Collection DVD, which has (aside from a tremendous photo gallery and interview with Peter Bogdanavich and other special features) a fantastic, thought-provoking commentary by film critic Marian Keane--it most certainly got *me* thinking!Great film, great entertainment, great message!

There is no kissing or love scene, no part where two characters sit down and talk for a long time, and quite frankly no part that isn't without action and tension in it. This doesn't sound like a good movie, but I'd like to say that there are two kinds of movies the kind that aims to win an oscar and place its mark in history while wowing the audience, and the kind that just wants to entertain the audience without trying to bore them. Reign of Fire is the latter; there is some drama in it but its mainly an action movie get that in your head before you diss it. There is are a lot of pyrotechnics involved, obviously, and I think this film uses them to the greatest potential. The pyrotechnics and special effects are fantastic and very realistic, with direction that captures its destruction perfectly. There is no gore in the movie either; while characters do get eaten by the dragon, the director made the smart move to just show them getting swiped away by the dragon and thats it. Like I said, this movie is meant to entertain the audience, not gross them out(though some individuals like myself don't mind a bit of gore here and there). I would have liked the movie to have the apache choppers in the posters featured, but not in the manner Godzilla did but sadly they aren't there. The movie, as I figured, isn't about characters loading up on weapons to blow the dragons away. Its about how they used their courage, their strategic options and sacrifice to defeat their enemies. It is an action movie, yes, but not the kind where the characters are like Rambo. The acting is good too Bale plays Quinn terrifically as the hot headed leader of the castle who's temper is the result of his desperation to protect his people. The guy who plays Van Zann is cool, too. He is a character who has continuously changing moods who really loses it once he gets excited. The female character was also good, for a change, and thank goodness she and Quinn don't kiss or anything like that. The world in Reign of Fire is terrific there isn't a single tree, nor a single blade of grass. Its just one gigantic field of ash and rubble. The city that was london is good too; if you thought stalingrad was a mess, boy should you see this one. Overall a good movie that is a welcome watch as long as you don't expect any high standards in the drama and plot department.
