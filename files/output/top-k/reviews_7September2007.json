[{"date":"7 September 2007","score":"11 out of 15 people found the following review useful","review":" Everything about 'Shrek' has probably already been said but here's my little comment. 'Shrek' is definitely one of the most enjoyable flicks. There has been tremendous work put in the animation process. Yet, the makers haven't given the screenplay any less considerations and we are told a heartwarming but relevant story. Though the characters of Shrek, Fiona and Donkey are original (maybe Donkey is from the Musicians of Bremen?), we also meet various fairy tale characters spoofed into the screenplay providing us several hilarious moments.Among the voice talents, Eddie Murphy steals the show with his loud, expressive and vivacious voice. He also gets the best lines. No wonder Donkey remains the favorite character. Mike Myers is adequate. However, he doesn't seem to get the accent right all the time. Cameron Diaz is good and John Lithgow does his part very well.I consider the soundtrack a must-buy. It boasts of a compilation of famous song that fairly contribute to the screenplay as background score. The writers deserve more credit for providing those memorable hilarious moments such as Fiona singing with the bird, Donkey and Dragon's affair, the snake and frog balloons and numerous other sketches.However, on the downside, there are a few plot holes e.g. Dragon's attraction towards Donkey isn't explained and why does Lord Farquaad torture the Gingerbread man? How would the Gingerbread man know about the others? Yet, the main plot of Fiona and Shrek mostly makes up for this flaw.Without any doubt, 'Shrek' is one of the best family flicks of recent time. Kids will love the colours and the fairy tale characters and grown-ups will love the witty dialogues and intelligent humour and most would love the story.

Wes Craven) It's nearing the 10th Anniversary of the film 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' and one of the stars, Heather Langenkamp is being scared by a voice on a phone, sounding very similar to the film's villain, Freddy Krueger. When Heather's husband is killed in a car accident and is discovered with slash marks on him, Heather starts to wonder something. Especially when she discovers that Wes Craven is writing another 'Nightmare' film. Soon, she realises that Freddy has now entered the real world, and the only way to defeat him is to become Nancy Thompson once again.When you first see the trailer for this movie, it looks very interesting and is an unusual concept for a film. A character from a film enters the real world. Could it work? Well it does and it's an amazing horror film which is easily the best since the original. If you are unfamiliar with the franchise, then you would love the suspense, and if you are a fan of everything behind the scenes, then you would love the references to the film world. This is a modern horror film which definitely works.Are you ready to become Nancy once again. - Wes Craven (Wes Craven) ","genre":null},{"date":"7 September 2007","score":"","review":" New Nightmare (1994, Dir.

This movie is great! The acting, the plot, the character development, the music, the photography, all very well done. But the best part is ... The convoluted continuity. Its like watching a plot fold out from the middle towards both ends. Whatever you do, don't blink. The players, all but one being unknown to me prior to this flick, do a fantastic job. This movie, and I'm not even sure of what genre it fits best having aspects of everything from crime drama to psychological thriller, is a credit to all involved. Kudos to the cast and crew, especially the director.

I believe this would be the dream of everyone. Immediately this movie came back to my memory. I googled Meryl Streep because I remembered her in the film, and found her on this website, then looked up the title of the movie.I want to eventually buy this movie because I agree with what most have said here, it's funny, it's a fantastic story and it's just one of those movies you can watch again and again and enjoy it every time. This movie also does make you rethink the way you live your life and the way everything you do can affect others.I'd highly recommend this to everyone.
