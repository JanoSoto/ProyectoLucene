And the weird thing is that I was a little disappointed that first time. Star Wars had been SO hyped that by the time I saw it back in 1977 I was expecting a non stop shoot 'em up from start to finish. The fact that the movie came out of the gate so quickly when Darth Vader and his storm troopers attacked and boarded Princess Leia's starship only increased those expectations. So naturally the folloeing scenes in the desert on Tattooine right after that intense opening was a bit of a letdown..it seemed to go on FOREVER, even though it really doesn't last that long. It wasn't until the 2nd time I saw it that it really hit me just how great this movie was. I think the trick was that I wasn't watching it with expectations or a critical eye the 2nd time..I just sat back and enjoyed it. A friend at the time criticized it for not being good science fiction, but he had it all wrong. Star Wars isn't a science fiction movie per se, though there are some terrific sci fi elements in it. At its heart, Star Wars is a fairy tale..maybe the greatest ever told.I guess I'll give my critics analysis, such as it is, as to why this movie is so great. It's not the effects, or the action, or the sets, even though all of the above are spectacular. It's the story, the dialog, and most of all those memorable characters who immediately draw you in. Mark Hamill is terrific as the eager young Luke Skywalker, who at this point in his life just wants to quit being a farmer and have some adventure. Carrie Fisher is equally good as the sharp-tongued Princess Leia. Fisher makes the most of some good lines (Would somebody get this big, walking CARPET out of my way?!). Harrison Ford is spot on as the cynical, wise-cracking, swashbuckling space pirate Han Solo (my favorite character in Star Wars). Not much to say about Obi-Wan Kenobi, other than the fact that he's played by the incomparable Alec Guinness, an actor's actor for whom a bad performance is a contradiction. Guinness could make the most basic line of dialog sound interesting. And oh, those robots. The back and forth between C3PO and R2D2 is beyond priceless. And of course, there's the bad guy to end all bad guys, Darth Vader. But as mean and heartless as Vader is, he's also, in a weird way, cool. The scene on the Death Star where Vader nearly chokes a pompous ass of a general to death (the first time we witness his telekinetic powers) is classic. You can see that Vader does not suffer fools well, even (or especially) when they're on his side. The action sequences, though very well done, are not overdone. George Lucas does a wonderful job of taking the concept of the dogfight and transposing it to outer space. Ditto the sword fighting scenes, substituting foils with light sabers..truly inspired. The same is true for the visual effects. They're wonderful, but they support the story and characters rather than upstage them, and although there are a lot of neat visuals, somehow you don't feel bombarded by them (unlike subsequent Star Wars movies, alas..). Again, having a strong story with compelling characters helps. The sets are terrific too (the Millennium Falcon is my favorite). One thing I like about Lucas' universe in Star Wars (as opposed to Gene Roddenberry's in Star Trek) is that not everything is pristine and perfect. Machines and equipment from the Falcon to the droids look well used. The scene that best personifies Lucas' universe is in the bar. It's like something right out of the old west..only with space aliens. You also get a bit of mysticism and sword and sorcery (as in the Force) to go with the sci fi..which will be expanded on in future films. A buddy of mine once said that Star Wars was the first movie that was EVERYTHING that a sci-fi action adventure could be. George Lucas called it his gift to a generation which grew up without fairy tales. I just call it fun; the greatest tour-de-force in motion picture history. Yes, there are movies which are far more serious, which examine human imperfections, harp on social issues, etc., but when I go to the movies, I want to forget about the world's troubles for a couple of hours, not be reminded of them. And Star Wars is the definition of escapist fair. The first one in its original cut is the best. The 90s re-release with added scenes and enhanced effects, though still good, was not necessary, and Lucas flat out ruined one of the classic scenes in the original movie the scene in the bar featuring Solo and Greedo.

They're wonderful, but they support the story and characters rather than upstage them, and although there are a lot of neat visuals, somehow you don't feel bombarded by them (unlike subsequent Star Wars movies, alas..). Again, having a strong story with compelling characters helps. The sets are terrific too (the Millennium Falcon is my favorite). One thing I like about Lucas' universe in Star Wars (as opposed to Gene Roddenberry's in Star Trek) is that not everything is pristine and perfect. Machines and equipment from the Falcon to the droids look well used. The scene that best personifies Lucas' universe is in the bar. It's like something right out of the old west..only with space aliens. You also get a bit of mysticism and sword and sorcery (as in the Force) to go with the sci fi..which will be expanded on in future films. A buddy of mine once said that Star Wars was the first movie that was EVERYTHING that a sci-fi action adventure could be. George Lucas called it his gift to a generation which grew up without fairy tales. I just call it fun; the greatest tour-de-force in motion picture history. Yes, there are movies which are far more serious, which examine human imperfections, harp on social issues, etc., but when I go to the movies, I want to forget about the world's troubles for a couple of hours, not be reminded of them. And Star Wars is the definition of escapist fair. The first one in its original cut is the best. The 90s re-release with added scenes and enhanced effects, though still good, was not necessary, and Lucas flat out ruined one of the classic scenes in the original movie the scene in the bar featuring Solo and Greedo.

There is some truth in that, but mind you, this is a TV-movie after all with all its limitations and considering that, it's doing a pretty good job.I had watched this movie because virology is a hobby of mine and there are very few films that deal with the subject of disease (some going down the road of the dreadful Outbreak; others being plain boring). On terms of following the rise of an epidemic, And the Band Played on works perfectly. At the same time, it catches the atmosphere of the 1980s, the paranoia, the general fear and confusion that marked the first appearance of AIDS.There have been arguments whether the movie is too pro- or anti-homosexuals but I tend to think that it handles the story pretty neutral and hence can be enjoyed by people who themselves are neutral on the issue. True, it doesn't show the gay community, especially the one in San Francisco, in a particularly favorable light (rampant promiscuity, spokespeople in (self)-denial, etc), but then again, there is no denying that without hot spots like SF and the selfish, shallow mentality of the people living there, the epidemic might have taken a different course. The film isn't much kinder on other factors that have facilitated the spread of AIDS in this period, namely conservative politicians of the Regan-era, greedy pharmaceutical companies and self-righteous scientists (especially Dr. Vincent Gallo is painted as a virtual psychopath; doubtful whether the Doctor could very flattered by his portrayal), but then again, why should a film be kind to people and organizations that, in time, would be responsible for millions of death? Another factor that makes this a good film is the director Roger Spottiswoode; many less experienced film-makers would have chosen to press the tear-duct of the viewer in order to get a response, but Spottiswoode doesn't take the cheap option. He's painting a grim picture of a grim situation but he never makes it look melodramatic or, with a few exceptions, sentimental. There's often a fine chemistry among the cast, especially the research team around Don Francis (Matthew Modine) &#x96; on other times, the chemistry seems forced, not quiet natural (for example, we are never explained why there should be such a deep bond between Francis and Bill Kraus (Ian McKellen)).In essence, though many criticisms are true &#x96; especially that too many story lines are cramped into a mere two hours (the rather lengthy book by Randy Shilts would probably have been better served by a mini-series) and that the film is a virtual star-sighting tour (some of the cameos lasting merely a few seconds) &#x96; it doesn't make it a bad movie.

(I'm 20.) Some people say that Hercules was the film that killed people's interest in animated Disney films after Pocahontas and The Hunchback of Notre Dame came out. I personally believe that it was a decent film. However, I think it could've turned out to be one of their best movies. It had the story to do it, and it also had a very funny, plus popular villain in Hades. It just turned out to be very problematic.First off, I think the way the story is told is very odd. You have 5 women, who are known as The Muses. They basically tell the beginning of the film in song, introduce us to Hades, and you see them appear during the movie. You see them have a song when Hercules is becoming popular, when Hercules' love interest, Meg, is trying to decide whether she's in love or not, and at the end of the film after Hercules stopped Hades. They act very surprised each time they appear. Oh my god, Hercules is becoming popular! Oh wow, he stopped Hades! I think if the Muses weren't telling the story, and it was told without continuing narration, this film would be considered a classic.I also have a problem with the transitions. At one point, the film is trying to be a comedy, and the other, it's dramatic. You can put them into a film, but you need it to transition well. It does not in this film. I think they were trying to be like Aladdin, but the transitions between comedy and drama worked in that film. It does not here.This film is also like ancient Greece meets modern day Las Vegas.

I love his films and he has one of the strongest track records in Hollywood history. The Shining is one of my favorites up their with Clockwork Orange, Dr. Strangelove and Full Metal Jacket. I love horror films with interesting stories, characters and real craftsmanship involved instead of gore fests, jump scare marathons like Paranormal Activity or lets kill infinite number of Japanese\/Korean girls in brutal ways by a monster or serial killer types of films.The Shinning is a slow, creepy, well acted, exceptionally well crafted horror film that has influenced modern pop-culture and future horror films. I love clever use of steadicam in films and interesting camera work in general because I can't stand shaky camera work or bland cinematography of the usual horror films. The setting of the Overlook hotel is perfect and gives this film unique and unforgettable atmosphere. The score is very minimalist and mostly relies on synthesizer rather than orchestral score. The acting like any other Kubrick film, is wonderful. Jack Nicholson gives one of his most iconic performances. Shelley Duvall provides a your more relatable, not so crazy wife. Danny Lloyd for young boy, gives a very creepy and effective performance. Scatman Crothers plays Scatman Crothers as the Hotel cook. Joe Turkel and Philip Stone, actors who have appeared in three Kubrick pictures, provide wonderfully creepy performances. All around a strong cast.As for the scary bits, The Shining isn't that scary. Mostly because we are familiar with the most iconic scenes before we have even seen the film. And because it's very different type of horror film. It relies on atmosphere, mood and doesn't waste time on jump scares or gore, but relies mostly on visuals, direction, sound and performances. It's no I Saw the Devil but it still can affect some people. I'm one of those people who doesn't like to be scared or disturb too much. I don't see entertainment value in it so that's why I generally don't watch these disturbing films like I Saw the Devil. I get entertainment value from the story, characters, dialog and the craftsmanship involved rather than how scary or disturbing the film is. That's why The Shining is the perfect horror film for me because it has all the elements in place.The Shining is a monumental achievement in horror genre. It stands as one of the best horror films of all time, up their with The Exorcist, The Haunting, The Thing, The Wicker Man, Ringu and Repulsion. A must see for anyone who enjoys real films.

I love horror films with interesting stories, characters and real craftsmanship involved instead of gore fests, jump scare marathons like Paranormal Activity or lets kill infinite number of Japanese\/Korean girls in brutal ways by a monster or serial killer types of films.The Shinning is a slow, creepy, well acted, exceptionally well crafted horror film that has influenced modern pop-culture and future horror films. I love clever use of steadicam in films and interesting camera work in general because I can't stand shaky camera work or bland cinematography of the usual horror films. The setting of the Overlook hotel is perfect and gives this film unique and unforgettable atmosphere. The score is very minimalist and mostly relies on synthesizer rather than orchestral score. The acting like any other Kubrick film, is wonderful. Jack Nicholson gives one of his most iconic performances. Shelley Duvall provides a your more relatable, not so crazy wife. Danny Lloyd for young boy, gives a very creepy and effective performance. Scatman Crothers plays Scatman Crothers as the Hotel cook. Joe Turkel and Philip Stone, actors who have appeared in three Kubrick pictures, provide wonderfully creepy performances. All around a strong cast.As for the scary bits, The Shining isn't that scary. Mostly because we are familiar with the most iconic scenes before we have even seen the film. And because it's very different type of horror film. It relies on atmosphere, mood and doesn't waste time on jump scares or gore, but relies mostly on visuals, direction, sound and performances. It's no I Saw the Devil but it still can affect some people. I'm one of those people who doesn't like to be scared or disturb too much. I don't see entertainment value in it so that's why I generally don't watch these disturbing films like I Saw the Devil. I get entertainment value from the story, characters, dialog and the craftsmanship involved rather than how scary or disturbing the film is. That's why The Shining is the perfect horror film for me because it has all the elements in place.The Shining is a monumental achievement in horror genre. It stands as one of the best horror films of all time, up their with The Exorcist, The Haunting, The Thing, The Wicker Man, Ringu and Repulsion. A must see for anyone who enjoys real films.

Basically crime fighting bullmastiff dog Agent 11 has been with the FBI in Seattle for a few years, trained by his master Agent Murdoch (Michael Clarke Duncan), and on one particular they are going after Mafia boss Sonny Talia (Paul Sorvino), who is taken to hospital after the dog rips off one of his testicles to be surgically replaced. Talia wants payback and tells his two bodyguards Gino (Joe Viterelli) and Arliss (Steve Schirripa) to kill the pooch while it is being transported for protection to an Alaskan training facility, but the dog escapes before they can catch him. Gordon Smith (David Arquette) who works as a mailman, and he like so many other mailmen hate dogs in the back or front yard as they are trying to deliver letters and packages, and he has volunteered for his neighbour Stephanie (Leslie Bibb) to look after her six year old son James (Two and a Half Men's Angus T. Jones). They meet Agent 11, and after a mistake involving a stuffed toy dog James thinks the real dog is for him, he is given the new name Spot, but being trained by the FBI he is not a regular dog, he has been taught since being a puppy not to play or be distracted, so no catching balls or frisbees. While Gino and Arliss continue to look for the dog, Gordon understands James is getting very close to Spot, but he is constantly being annoyed by his presence, as time goes by though they are becoming successful in making himself a regular playful dog. After an encounter with the bodyguards in a pet store, the FBI realise Agent 11 is missing, and eventually they locate him and Agent Murdoch arrives to take his dog back, but the dog escapes again, only to come against Talia again as he attempts to kill the dog himself, but he is outsmarted, caught and arrested. In the end the FBI still try to take their agent dog back, but Spot is given the choice to go back with them or stay with his new friends, he chooses Gordon and James, but he licks Murdoch goodbye, and Stephanie, who has gone through hell, returns upset, but James helps out, and they kiss each other. Also starring Scary Movie 3's Anthony Anderson as Benny and Kim Hawthorne as Cassavettes. Arquette is the sort of actor who would choose to be in a film like this, but he is pretty good actually, Bibb gets her own giggles, Jones is cute as the boy, and the dog of the picture is obviously a good character himself, I can see the resemblance combination to Turner & Hooch and Home Alone, the story is simple enough, it obviously has the silly and boring moments, but overall it is fun, a cheesy but acceptable family comedy.

A blockbuster - no expense spared. Lowry and Burnett (Will Smith and Martin Lawrence) are Miami PD and working on a drug bust heist from within the PD itself. It's a big film, even on a small screen you get the impression of scale, and everything is impressive. You are treated to slow motion shots accentuating our heroes in grand cinematography-style, long chases with Will Smith's shirt wide open, model-esque women everywhere, and everything is just glamorous. Tea Leoni is the love interest but in a messed up sort of way because she's in the middle of a subterfuge and Lowry and Burnett have switched roles... she witnessed her best friend get shot and is now the target, and Lowry is looking after her, except it's Burnett and his wife is MAD. It's typical action-adventure stuff; huge scenes, car chases, big stunts, car chases, explosions, wanton disregard of realistic police procedure, respect for human life or property and thinking nothing of blowing up a motorway etc ... very similar in feel to Speed, which incidentally has a very similar theme tune to Bad Boys (along with The Rock), and all three are exciting and ramp up the feeling of action. There's a lot of comedy - between Smith and Lawrence, in their fast talking brash way, then there's the sarcastic humour of their boss Joe Pantoliano (Matrix) in similar fashion to John C McGinley in Point Break, then there's the situational comedy of things being silly and going wrong and you really get the connection between Smith and Lawrence as actors - they play it well. There is a really good chemistry between them, and it's quite a bromance movie as well as action (I have no idea whether the two are friends in real life but their relationship is believable on screen). The plot is of course the least of importance in this film and is rather flimsy, but films like this are about visuals and Bad Boys is a great watch that you can watch again and again. It hasn't aged too badly - except in terms of technology (pagers and large in car phones) - and Will Smith is always a joy to watch. Tea Leoni is very good, and oddly believable in her role and her chemistry with the two actors was fun. It's a sexy film; Smith just is as he is so assured of himself, but also the chemistry between Leoni and Smith, although it's not at the forefront of the plot. It's clichéd left right and centre, of course, nothing original, or particularly challenging but not mindless, and I wouldn't be giving out any Oscars but everything comes together to create something you want to go to the cinema to see. It's a very entertaining action film with the added and lightening aspect of comedy.

I was particularly impressed with effects such as the broken glass containing the gold, the UFO landing as well as the floating items (it looked pretty seamless).

Not exactly a glowing endorsement, but it is what it is--a kid's film from Disney. It's a shame, though, as Davis wasn't particularly good or useful to the film--Lee was clearly more interesting and integral to the film.

The 83 minute long film mixes traditional biography of Theremin's life, his loves (marrying a black ballet dancer in the 1930s), his political persecution in the Stalin era Soviet Union, details on the history, construction, and musical influence of the theremin, and a summary of it all.The film features interviews with Todd Rungren, Robert Moog, who discourses on Theremin's role in electronic music, his own influential career, and has a number of lesser known talking heads, and one transcendently silly interview with a literally batshit insane Brian Wilson (of The Beach Boys fame), who speaks wanderingly of how he got the idea to use the theremin for his hit song Good Vibrations. Archival footage and audio only clips of theremin music, as well as clips from many films- including 1940s A films like Spellbound and The Lost Weekend, and 1950s B and sci fi films, like It Came From Outer Space and The Day The Earth Stood Still, testify to the influence of the film.However, the film's star is not Leon Theremin, but his younger protégé, the great theremin player, Clara Rockmore. And when I state that this woman was great, I mean it. Her handling of the theremin dwarfs all the other players. This virtuoso could literally make the instrument, which could range from producing eerie to barely tolerable sounds, into an instrument of, well, to beg the cliché, genius. In Rockmore's air divining fingers, the theremin could sound like the most virtuoso female singing voice ever recorded. Her talent level, on this instrument, is so staggeringly far above any of the other on screen players that it is akin to watching humans and a cvreature from another species do the same task.Additionally, this film, unlike the first, is much more dependent upon the technical aspects to cohere it into a narrative and artistic whole. Aside from director Martin, kudos must go out to cinematographer Robert Stone and, especially editor Robert Greenwald. Rare is the film where the editor plays a larger role than the cinematographer, but this is one of those films. By the end of the film, we get to see the long awaited reunion of Theremin and Rockmore- who long feared Theremin was dead, after he was kidnapped in 1938 and forcibly returned to the Soviet Union. The film deserved its many honors at film festivals.
