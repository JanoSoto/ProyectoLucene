Lucas is a great storyteller, maybe not the best at dialogue, but in general a great storyteller. The entire storyline from 1-6 (no expanded universe crap) is simply incredible, from Anakin's discovery & training, to his turning & tierney, to finally his fall & redemption. But back to Episode 2. I thought the dialogue was well written. You want to compare it to something? Bust this. Th dialogue in this movie is better than the dialogue of any black comedy or Chris Rock movie where all they do is go like Damn nigga that crackas got mo money den me, he be oppressin me Oh yeah GREAT dialogue there. Yet in reviews of movies like that, there is never a whine about bad dialogue being written. Noooo everyone just has to find something to pick on about Lucas because he's a frikkin millionaire and all.You fans are never content are you? You saw episode I and you hated it, whining about Jar Jar Binks and the CGI ( I don't know HOW anyone could complain about that). And now you see episode II and you whine about the dumbest things like 'bad dialogue'.. oh please please show me great dialogue. The only movie I can think of that has great dialogue off the top of my head is Reservoir Dogs. That's because Tarantino can write great dialogue that comes off as everyday lingo. People give me a break and stop being so stupid with your reviews. Bad dialogue.. bah! The movie was entertaining in the least. What were your eyes closed the entire movie that you have to complain about dialogue? I was entranced with the beauty of the CGI.I thought Christopher Lee was incredible as Count Dooku. I loved Ewan as Obi-Wan. Hayden Christensen did an outstanding job as Anakin. I felt the hate burn with him and his acting alike. Natalie Portman did a MUCH better job in this one than in Episode 1 where she was monotonous. It was great to see Anakin starting to go to the dark side, and the origin of the stormtroopers and Boba Fett.. and I was extremely happy to see Senator Palpatine's rise to become the Emporer of the later series. Too bad Jango Fett got copped out easily like Boba did in Jedi.Great movie. Lots of fun!

It tells the story of two couples, which are very different together. David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes play a studying couple, which decides to get out of their university for a while and start to build their common project to write a book about serial killers and thus try to study the minds of those killers and their motivations. He would do the writing and she would take important photographs. Their plan is to visit the most famous murder scenes in America (and to end their trip to K\/California, her long lasting dream place) and take pictures, make interviews etc. Only problem is that driving so much would cost too much money for them, so they have to get some financial help by taking another couple going to K\/California (Pitt and Lewis) with them and thus share the costs. Soon something more than surprising and threatening is about to reveal about the identities of this mysterious Pitt\/Lewis couple...No more about the plot. The film is about the psyche of serial killer, a person who is capable of killing another man without feeling any guilt or pain. The film tries to find some answers for that important question what differs us from those serial killers, and how someone is able to do such a horrible acts of violence. *minor spoiler ahead* The film ends in the Duchovny's character's conclusion that deep inside, there is no huge difference between normal people's abilities to kill and serial killers' abilities to do that. *no spoilers* A human being is a beast deep inside, we have instincts and things we don't like to talk about, it's only about what side of our nature is primary and what side is kept somewhere hiding and un-active. The film ends as the main protagonist is about to finish his job and has found some very dark sides of his own soul, too. The traumatic childhood is again one key reason for the birth of these disturbed minds, and the film tells once again the importance of safe and peaceful childhood. The main theme of Kalifornia is the psyche of human being, and many aspects of it. Whether we want it or not, admit it or not, what the film says about our many sides of nature are totally true, and the main character learns that in the most violent and nightmarish way.Technically this film is brilliant! Kalifornia is shot by Bojan Bazelli, a guy who has made many Ferrara films look as fantastic as they look, and the beginning of Kalifornia is almost as fantastic as the rain scene in King of New York, one of Abel Ferrara's most important films (which are plenty!). The beginning of Kalifornia is very intense and gorgeous looking and proves that this film is something very special. The photography is throughout the film very professional, and also the editing is as great as possible. Fantastic camera work once again, Bojan! The actors do wonderful jobs, too, and there are only couple of flaws I found in this film and these flaws make me give the film not as high rating as I wanted.First of all, I think that the characters are too shallow in some cases. For example, I don't think Duchovny's and Forbes' relationship is presented too warmly, even though they are meant to be in love and care about each other. There should've been more depth and love visible in their relationship. The one reviewer here (Mr. Rogers) said that the characters are very well built in this film, but somehow I think they are occasionally too shallow and have no depth and interest they should have. But at least the piano escape (!) scene at the end shows that there is caring between these two lovers..But still there should've been more between them, and also between other characters in the film. The other thing about the characters is, that occasionally they act very stupidly and like cliches that need not to be explained. The characters in Kalifornia are not as multi leveled and well built as they should have been. The other (minor) flaw in Kalifornia is that it runs slightly too long and there are scenes that are not too necessary and give nothing important to the film. But once the end scene comes, and we learn what kind of a conclusion Duchovny comes, the film is very rewarding and gives interesting philosophic thoughts, and I think a film this difficult to understand and for mainstream audiences to like, would not come out too easily from Hollywood these days, and that is very sad. All Hollywood seems to be able to do nowadays is stupid entertainment for pop corn loving people. But fortunately there are many exceptions, too.Usually these kind of films are not liked because of the content, violence and sex for instance. But gladly I can say that even though the violence is pretty disturbing (and the film had to be cut in order to get R rating), the violence is never too excessive or gratuitously brutal, and the scenes of violence are shown with taste and style. The one love making scene was, of course, too much for MPAA but nobody should be repelled for one sex scene, in my opinion. What I'm trying to say is, that even though the subject matter is serial killers, the imagery is not too rough and the film proves that director Sena has a sense of style and never wants just to shock the audience with blood and splatter and thus try to make the film noticeable.Kalifornia is very interesting and also rewarding film, and without those mentioned and pretty minor flaws, this would've get even higher rating from me. After all, this is one of the most interesting Hollywood movies of the 90's. 7\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"14 June 2002","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  Dominic Sena's feature debut was this film, Kalifornia, from 1993.

The film is about the psyche of serial killer, a person who is capable of killing another man without feeling any guilt or pain. The film tries to find some answers for that important question what differs us from those serial killers, and how someone is able to do such a horrible acts of violence. *minor spoiler ahead* The film ends in the Duchovny's character's conclusion that deep inside, there is no huge difference between normal people's abilities to kill and serial killers' abilities to do that. *no spoilers* A human being is a beast deep inside, we have instincts and things we don't like to talk about, it's only about what side of our nature is primary and what side is kept somewhere hiding and un-active. The film ends as the main protagonist is about to finish his job and has found some very dark sides of his own soul, too. The traumatic childhood is again one key reason for the birth of these disturbed minds, and the film tells once again the importance of safe and peaceful childhood. The main theme of Kalifornia is the psyche of human being, and many aspects of it. Whether we want it or not, admit it or not, what the film says about our many sides of nature are totally true, and the main character learns that in the most violent and nightmarish way.Technically this film is brilliant! Kalifornia is shot by Bojan Bazelli, a guy who has made many Ferrara films look as fantastic as they look, and the beginning of Kalifornia is almost as fantastic as the rain scene in King of New York, one of Abel Ferrara's most important films (which are plenty!). The beginning of Kalifornia is very intense and gorgeous looking and proves that this film is something very special. The photography is throughout the film very professional, and also the editing is as great as possible. Fantastic camera work once again, Bojan! The actors do wonderful jobs, too, and there are only couple of flaws I found in this film and these flaws make me give the film not as high rating as I wanted.First of all, I think that the characters are too shallow in some cases. For example, I don't think Duchovny's and Forbes' relationship is presented too warmly, even though they are meant to be in love and care about each other. There should've been more depth and love visible in their relationship. The one reviewer here (Mr. Rogers) said that the characters are very well built in this film, but somehow I think they are occasionally too shallow and have no depth and interest they should have. But at least the piano escape (!) scene at the end shows that there is caring between these two lovers..But still there should've been more between them, and also between other characters in the film. The other thing about the characters is, that occasionally they act very stupidly and like cliches that need not to be explained. The characters in Kalifornia are not as multi leveled and well built as they should have been. The other (minor) flaw in Kalifornia is that it runs slightly too long and there are scenes that are not too necessary and give nothing important to the film. But once the end scene comes, and we learn what kind of a conclusion Duchovny comes, the film is very rewarding and gives interesting philosophic thoughts, and I think a film this difficult to understand and for mainstream audiences to like, would not come out too easily from Hollywood these days, and that is very sad. All Hollywood seems to be able to do nowadays is stupid entertainment for pop corn loving people. But fortunately there are many exceptions, too.Usually these kind of films are not liked because of the content, violence and sex for instance. But gladly I can say that even though the violence is pretty disturbing (and the film had to be cut in order to get R rating), the violence is never too excessive or gratuitously brutal, and the scenes of violence are shown with taste and style. The one love making scene was, of course, too much for MPAA but nobody should be repelled for one sex scene, in my opinion. What I'm trying to say is, that even though the subject matter is serial killers, the imagery is not too rough and the film proves that director Sena has a sense of style and never wants just to shock the audience with blood and splatter and thus try to make the film noticeable.Kalifornia is very interesting and also rewarding film, and without those mentioned and pretty minor flaws, this would've get even higher rating from me. After all, this is one of the most interesting Hollywood movies of the 90's. 7\/10  ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Horror"},{"date":"14 June 2002","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  Dominic Sena's feature debut was this film, Kalifornia, from 1993.

Though I wouldn't classify myself as a die-hard fan, I enjoyed Scooby for what it was; mindless entertainment. Only as I got older did I gain an appreciation for the humorous druggie subtext involving Shaggy, and the questionable sexuality of Velma, not to mention a few other things that may or may not have been pre-planned by Mssrs. Hanna and Barbera. Since this is a family-friendly film, none of these two issues is alluded to in the film, with the minor exception of a funny reference to a certain 'Mary Jane.' When I first got word of a live-action version being planned, I was skeptical. Oh, I knew Scooby could be pulled off with CGI, but my concern was primarily about the casting of the film. Which actors could possibly breath life into these formerly two-dimensional characters and make them real? The choices were somewhat risky, but then again so was the entire premise of a live action Scooby. I'm actually happy to report that the cast does a mostly good job, with two real stand-outs. Freddie Prinze, Jr. is passable as Fred (though a little slight on the physical side compared to his more muscular animated counterpart) and Sarah Michelle Gellar is all right as Daphne, though not quite blonde enough to be true to the cartoon version. The true stand-outs are Linda Cardellini as Velma and Matthew Lillard as Shaggy.The heart and soul of the entire Scooby franchise is, I believe, Shaggy and his relationship with Scooby, and I can honestly say that Lillard plays his part to perfection. There is not a single flaw to be found in his performance. It is, quite simply, brilliant. If the authenticity with which an actor breaths life into a character is any measure of what goes into an Academy Award winning performance, then in a completely fair world, Lillard would be nominated for one next year. He's just that good. He manages to make a CGI rendered Scooby seem that much more alive, and the love he feels for his canine friend is palpable. In the same light, Linda Cardellini breaths life into the character of Velma. She makes you see the vulnerability beneath the brains, and manages to make Fred and Daphne look better than they actually are whenever she's in a scene with them. I am very impressed by these two performances. As for the story, it's the same one that can be seen in every episode of the cartoon show, with only the names of the characters changed to give the appearance of a new storyline. As for who the bad guy turns out to be in the end, it's a fitting choice for anyone who truly likes the Scooby Doo-niverse. I believe the secret to enjoying this incarnation of Scooby Doo is to ask yourself just one question Have you ever watched more than one entire episode of the cartoon series?

And yes, the score at the end dripped with too much melodrama to be effective.But you know what, despite all that, the movie still works.  It had me, and a good number of the audience, teary eyed at the appropriate moments.  It had me smiling like a dork in the joyous moments of the film.For me, what made this movie so effective was the performance and chemistry of the leads, Shane West and Mandy Moore.  They made celluloid romance look real and sincere.  Their emotions and feelings were palpable. The film and the actors gave one of the best depictions of real love.  There is maturity and innocence in their actions.  And that's what makes this movie different from other run-of-the-mill romance movies.Mandy Moore really surprised me at how effective she was in conveying Jamie's innocence and  strength of character.  Her sweet face and graceful manner make her almost otherworldy, but she still manages to reach out to the viewers and tug at their emotions as if she was someone they knew all their life.  I believe we'll be seeing more of Mandy in Hollywood which I think is a good thing.Shane West is another revelation.  He had the difficult task of showing Landon's growth from aimless youth to self-assured adult capable of self-less love. And he pulled it off.  His subtle performance made Landon's transformation believable and does not suffer a single awkward moment. Like Mandy, I hope we see more of Mr.West in Hollywood.Others have complained that the story is too squeaky clean and it's totally impossible that two teeners could be so controlled when it came to sex. Well, guess what...there are responsible teen-agers out there.  They just don't get enough attention since most of Hollywood think that only sex will sell to a young audience.  The box-office performance of A Walk To Remember certainly disproves that.  Young people, adults and grannies alike enjoyed this movie. It's about time that Hollywood showed another kind of teenager. The kind that you can admire.As for the comments that this one was just another Prety-ugly-girl movie where the heroine is just waiting for a make-over...well, I don't know what movie you were watching but Walk was definitely not it.  Jamie was never ugly to begin with.  She just didn't dress right and did things that were unusual for other kids.  All that branded her as an outcast.  And where is it written that being pretty ensured popularity in High School?  That's  a fallacy.  Lots of pretty girls in high school but they weren't popular since they didn't have the right friends, the right clothes, the flashy attitude or other things that made one popular.  The Jamie character was that kind of pretty girl.  She had the pretty face but had a strong sense of self to not be concerned with superficial things.  Again, that's what made her different.    And she never had a make-over in the movie!  She stayed true to herself til the end.Congratulations to Shane, Mandy and the filmmakers of A Walk To Remember! It was a risky move to go against the mainstream of sex and violence in films.  But judging from the user comments in this site, you guys did the right thing.  This is simply one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.P.S.  The soundtrack is excellent as well.

When they do come together it isn't always convincing but it is very well organised and isn't as cluttered as it could have been.The cast are OK &#150; but you can see it that they all think they're onto a good thing rather than a cash in!  Aiello and Spader have the main characters and do alright. Jeff Daniels clearly saw the opportunity to do 2 days shooting and is so-so, Stoltz looks like a child and doesn't do well.  Theron and Hatcher are sexy even if they're there for nothing else.  They all do OK but really they don't have the dialogue to feast on like the Pulp Fiction cast had.Overall this is OK if you come at it as a film &#150; it's not great but it's slick enough to entertain.  However you can't help feel like it's the little brother of Pulp Fiction that wants to catch some of it's brother's glory.

I dare to ask a counterquestion does anybody know what it sounds like when a Lithuanian is speaking Russian? Frankly, I have no idea whatsoever. Not having had the opportunity yet to watch Red October in the English original version, everybody in it speaks accent-free German anyways to me. -) (I consider the loss of accents the major flaw of dubbing over here- movies like Forrest Gump or O Brother Where Art Thou' should in my view be done with a Bavarian accent.)   But back to the movie in question. It seems like everybody is sharing one's personal experience here, so I will add mine here. And enough has been said about the many qualitites of the movie, as had been pointed out before.The Hunt for Red October is a memorable movie experience even to the point that I explained the whole problematic of the cold war to my sister (by then 7 years old) while being a really bad babysitter and watching the movie with her. What can I say- it is still one of her favourites (by the year 2004 she would be allowed to watch it legally in a movie theatre here).Just to complete my contribution to this forum 10 points for Red October.

The script is incredibly good and makes you wish every movie in the world could turn out as well as THE WOMEN. The performances all blend together perfectly, which is what you need if you are going to tell a story like this. Joan Crawford is sublime as the husband stealer and Norma Shearer plays the usual virtuous kind of part she always played in her career. However in my opinion, Roz Russell, who played Mrs. Fowler simply is at her best. It is one of the most funny and exquisite performances that i have ever seen given by an actress on film. It is plain to see she only cares about herself and her own superficial motives but you cant help being on her side and enjoying all the trouble she stirs up. And also Paulette Goddard gave a sassy performance as the sarcastic woman who has seen it all and wants no more of it. The best scene of hers is when she and Mrs. Fowler fight at the divorce ranch. I loved this movie! ","genre":null},{"date":"14 June 2002","score":"15 out of 20 people found the following review useful","review":"  This movie is two wonderful hours of gossipy, clever fun.
