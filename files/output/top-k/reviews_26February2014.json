Not only that but the film looks and sounds like a Python sketch in various places much like 'Jabberwocky' did. Not complaining just pointing it out, love the film title though and those lovely looking opening credits.The first film in Gilliam's off the wall dream-like fantasy film trilogy where the plot basically revolves around escaping reality through imagination...or a dream. In this surreal adventure a young boy is zapped through time with the help of a bunch of dwarfs. This little team go around pinching loot trying to get rich with the aid of a map that shows them time holes to jump through time. On their tail is an evil sorcerer who wants the map for evil purposes and the maps owner the 'Supreme Being' (God?).The film starts off in a very simple manner that is quite enjoyable. Its very similar to the later Bill and Ted franchise as we jump to the Napoleonic Wars and meet Napoleon, then to England meeting up with Robin Hood and then to Greece meeting King Agamemnon. These few segments are good fun showcasing the films main big name cameos such as a rather dull Connery as Agamemnon, a very good Ian Holm as the height obsessed Napoleon and the brilliant Cleese as a rather stiff upper lipped Robin Hood and his cutthroat band of merry men. The Robin Hood sequence is easily the best with Cleese donning a daft over sized green Hood hat and typical clichéd Hood attire. He looks utterly ridiculous in his pantomime garb where as in contrast his men are a bunch of dirty filthy violent scum. The other funny angle is the fact Cleese speaks quite normally in his aloof aristocratic manner and his men don't, they are just your standard commoner oiks.Once we are introduced to the villainous 'Evil' (that's his name) who wants the map things kinda nose dive in my opinion. The dwarf team stop time jumping and instead go on the run from Evil but end up in Evil's realm and things just become all too weird. There are some nice moments that are typically Gilliam in visual style and idea, the galleon perched on top of the underwater giants head is a good one. No real clue what the hell was going on there, why the galleon is stuck to this giants head (it appeared to be his hat), why the giant was under the sea and who or what was in that little cottage before the giant crushed it??. Looked like some kind of elephant alien person, quirky little moment but totally off the wall, they just get killed then?.The entire final sequence where the dwarfs and little boy fight against Evil is just a mess really. This sorcerer is obviously pretty invincible yet the dwarfs conjure up all these pointless character from various time periods to fight him. I know its a young persons film but this battle is really quite hokey. Then in the end we meet the Supreme Being who turns out to be (or at least in human form) an elderly man in a suit who can't really act too well, nice concept though.I think the main thing that I disliked in this film was the little boy in the main role. This is an old film sure and the kid actor didn't have to be a great actor I admit but damn he's fudging annoying. His soft weedy whiny voice just grates the whole time and fails to give his character any impact at all, he always begs and pleads like a baby but you can hardly hear him half the time because he's so quiet...and wet. Am I being harsh? maybe, but this kid ruins the film, should of used a girl. The squad of dwarfs are the films main hook really...much like 'Willow'. None of them are particularly good actors but they are amusing and they do add to the fantasy charm. Seeing them all dressed up in their nifty warrior-like bandit outfits is kinda cool, clearly Gilliam (or someone) had this idea and knew they had to make a film around it.The film is essentially a kids flick, an imaginative adventure for young boys who like to play war, knights, cowboys etc...In that sense the film does its job and delivers a highly imaginative yarn no doubt. As an adult watching now the film doesn't quite hit the mark for me anymore, I guess the thrill has been left behind with age coupled with the fact the film doesn't really look very good anymore. It has dated quite badly in all honesty and the effects can be a bit dodgy. Like I said the first half set in the few time periods is good but after that it gets a bit rough around the edges. The very end feels too open ended also, definitely needed a more conclusive finish.In the end the film is a fun little ride with some nice visual ideas, but I can't help but feel without those few Python cameos this film wouldn't be half as much fun.

The word influential is one that you are going to read in every positive review of this movie you see, and I'm not going to dispute that specific claim about the film. What I will say is... I just don't find this film, standing on its own, to be very impressive.To be fair, I'll start with the things about this film that are good. The cinematography, for example, is interesting throughout and several shots were done very well. The cinematography easily stands out as the best part of this film. There are some shots here and there that I do not care for, but these are negligible compared to the amount of good ones.There are also some aspects of the story that I feel were interesting. The beginning of the film sets things up to have a lot of potential, opening very strongly. Sadly, it goes downhill from there. The writing, especially in regards to exposition, is just plain awful at some points.The worst example of this comes just after the excellent opening finishes, in which the main character is set up for an interrogation. What this turns out to be is three cops directly telling the viewer his life story, without having him answer a single question. When he finally asks if there is an actual reason for him being there, even the cops have no response and just let him go. This is one of the worst ways I've ever seen first act exposition done. It's cheap and silly.A close second for worst moment of exposition comes towards the end of the film, when the contents of the box are to be revealed. Now, never showing exactly what something is in order to let the viewer use their own imagination is a completely valid technique in film, but it only works when the viewer gets interesting hints and clues with which to base their explanation on. What the writer in this film gives us is a ludicrously silly word association game. Instead of cleverly weaving hints into the story, there is a moment where a character literally just lists a few spooky phrases like Manhattan Project and tells everyone to draw their own image up from the words. I can't believe more people aren't pointing scenes like this out when they are supposedly analyzing the intricacy of the story.Finally, I just found the entire second act of the story dull. You can have a great opening and a surprising finish like this movie does, but if the second act can't keep you interested, the whole story falls apart. The middle section mostly consists of the main character going to a place, talking to a person who refuses to cooperate, conveniently finding another bit of information anyway, and then going to the next person to repeat the cycle, of course being captured and escaping a few times along the way. It's a cookie cutter detective story at its most bland. I can't help but recall movies with a nearly identical structure, such as Fritz Lang's masterpiece The Big Heat, in which the process is the same, but with so much more tension driving the story as it goes along. Big Heat admittedly doesn't even start out as strong as this film does, but its compelling second act makes the beginning and (already great) ending even better, which is just what Kiss Me Deadly fails to do.Overall, Kiss Me Deadly is not a bad film. It's entertaining to watch, and definitely very different from pretty much any noir you'll see with its unique third act. But there are just so many flaws with the story and storytelling that I can't see why this is held up by many as being one of the greatest of all time, even THE greatest to some.It's worth watching at least once, but if you're looking for a masterfully crafted work of art in the noir genre, I would personally say your time would be better spent on movies such as Orson Welles' Touch of Evil, Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity, and of course, the aforementioned The Big Heat.

The idea, I suppose, was that prolonged exposure to something bad will, psychologically, turn off all urges to repeat that same offense. Horse Pucky! I decried, not believing such a tale could possibly be true . . . until I saw Showgirls. I like sexy naked women as much as the next guy but after this movie was jiggled in my face for two and a half hours, I didn't want to see another naked body for about the next two years (Freud would have eaten me alive).I doubt that the movie had the same effect on Joe Esterhauz, the author from whose pen this sheepdip flowed. Not long after the movie came out, I was watching one of those making of specials and Esterhauz said that the movie was a hard-boiled expose on the empowerment of women (yeah . . . okay). The special boasted that this was a recurring theme throughout his work which includes Basic Instinct, Flashdance, Jade and Sliver. I guess that Joe and I must have different ideas about female empowerment because his idea seems to be to portray women as hookers, strippers, killers and raging lesbian predators (anything outside those four categories and they're fishfood). He apparently thinks that their best activities for empowerment are knives, lesbianism, sex for cash, violence and nasty sneers (Mr. Freud, you would have had to put overtime in on this one).In Showgirls, the women could be any one of these things. Violence is so much an afterthought to their personalities that it comes out in their speech, their clothes, their stares, their dancing and even their collegian stuffed lips. It oozes from every pore and even comes out in a scene at a fast food restaurant when the heroine furiously squirts ketchup all over her french fries. For me that scene proved a commentary on the film because, well, you know how when you squeeze a plastic ketchup bottle it makes that loud flatulent noise? You get the idea.I think Joe knows that he has a lousy script because he keeps throwing in deterrents so that we hopefully won't realize that the script is featherweight. Deterrence like nudity for example which got the film an NC-17 but should have been an NC-95 so no one would have had to sit through it. The characters reside in Vegas but the movie might as well have been staged in a nudist colony. Nearly every scene is littered with wall to wall skin, whether the scene calls for it or not.

Esterhauz turns out the be the only boob attached to this project that is not on screen.The movie follows the destiny of a walking bag of hostility named Nomi Malone (played by Elizabeth Berkley whose acting comes in two flavors Stare blankly and blink) who has killer looks and the brain of an appliance bulb. She's a leather-clad bad-chick from the wrong side of the tracks who hitches to Vegas to become a dancer. How are we to be sure that she's bad? She wears leather, carries a switchblade and cakes on enough make-up to make Tammy Faye wince.Perhaps, she figures, all that badness makes her a human shield against that cold and unfeeling landscape of bitter failure and resentment known as Las Vegas. When she gets there she finds that Vegas is, well, a cold and unfeeling landscape of bitter failure and resentment.Everyone in the movie approaches Nomi like a lion smacking it's chops. Everyone hates each other (which makes us hate them and therefore the movie) but Esterhauz explains that in this hellish world of hostility and sexual vengeance Nomi learns a lesson in morality (Really?

The roommates situation is just an excuse for pseudo-semi-sorta-kinda halfway attempt at some lesbian shenanigans hinted at because Nomi and Molly sleep naked in the same bed.

It's like a bizarre tribal dance in which the dancers contort in front of feux volcanoes and do spidery things with their fingers.

I decried, not believing such a tale could possibly be true . . . until I saw Showgirls. I like sexy naked women as much as the next guy but after this movie was jiggled in my face for two and a half hours, I didn't want to see another naked body for about the next two years (Freud would have eaten me alive).I doubt that the movie had the same effect on Joe Esterhauz, the author from whose pen this sheepdip flowed. Not long after the movie came out, I was watching one of those making of specials and Esterhauz said that the movie was a hard-boiled expose on the empowerment of women (yeah . . . okay). The special boasted that this was a recurring theme throughout his work which includes Basic Instinct, Flashdance, Jade and Sliver. I guess that Joe and I must have different ideas about female empowerment because his idea seems to be to portray women as hookers, strippers, killers and raging lesbian predators (anything outside those four categories and they're fishfood). He apparently thinks that their best activities for empowerment are knives, lesbianism, sex for cash, violence and nasty sneers (Mr. Freud, you would have had to put overtime in on this one).In Showgirls, the women could be any one of these things. Violence is so much an afterthought to their personalities that it comes out in their speech, their clothes, their stares, their dancing and even their collegian stuffed lips. It oozes from every pore and even comes out in a scene at a fast food restaurant when the heroine furiously squirts ketchup all over her french fries. For me that scene proved a commentary on the film because, well, you know how when you squeeze a plastic ketchup bottle it makes that loud flatulent noise? You get the idea.I think Joe knows that he has a lousy script because he keeps throwing in deterrents so that we hopefully won't realize that the script is featherweight. Deterrence like nudity for example which got the film an NC-17 but should have been an NC-95 so no one would have had to sit through it. The characters reside in Vegas but the movie might as well have been staged in a nudist colony. Nearly every scene is littered with wall to wall skin, whether the scene calls for it or not.

For starters, the movie doesn't do a very good job setting up its heroine - we learn next to nothing about her that makes us care about her. With this in mind, combined with the fairly short running time (as well as some pivotal characters ending up having limited footage), this suggests that a lot of character development ended up on the cutting room floor. Despite this, there are also a number of really slow stretches here and there. As for the horror angle of the movie, I have to admit that I wasn't really creeped out at any moment - there is a contrived air to the moments of horror. Though I was somewhat uncomfortable about the fact that Richard Lynch's character is destroyed by a fire when Lynch in real life was severely burned in a real fire years earlier. I will say that for a low budget production, the movie is pretty well produced, looking slick and more expensive than it really was. It's too bad that the filmmakers' ability to squeeze every penny out of limited funds wasn't done with a better script.

The first reel consists of stock footage recycled from its predecessor (here set 30 years later), followed by George Zucco's Andoheb handing down his rather undemanding job as High Priest of Karnak to a much younger recruit, Mehemet Bey, played by Turhan Bey, in what he later stated was his favorite role. Taking up residence at a cemetery in Mapleton, Massachusetts, determined to kill off the remaining survivors of the previous film's expedition, Mehemet Bey and his pet monster seem to be doing pretty well, as all their victims are old and feeble (even beloved Mary Gordon!), and all any witnesses claim to see is a shadow that disappears once they look up (watch for burly Glenn Strange tending his frightened horse, and pretty Janet Shaw in Lover's Lane). The torch wielding villagers are augmented by more stock footage, from both Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein, but worst of all are the two survivors, pretty and wholesome Elyse Knox (mother of lookalike son, actor Mark Harmon), whose character is a total blank, and John Hubbard, so obnoxious and unsympathetic that he allows his ancestral home to go up in flames, with Elyse still in the Mummy's clutches! (she reunited with Chaney in her very last film, 1949's There's a Girl in My Heart). Most hilarious are the numerous front page headlines in boldface, incredulously spreading out from Mapleton to New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles! (none of the film's newshounds can rouse themselves away from the local saloon). Among the wide-eyed investigators are Cliff Clark (The Grapes of Wrath) and Frank Reicher, whose character returns in the next sequel, The Mummy's Ghost (I DREAM OF JEANNIE's General Schaeffer, Vinton Hayworth, has a bit as a reporter). Rarely cast as a villain, Turhan Bey is really too slick to be effective, but certainly ranks higher than the bland Peter Coe in The Mummy's Curse. In the first of his three assignments in the part of Kharis the Mummy, Lon Chaney is only allowed one blinking eye and five fingers on one hand, due to the fire damage endured by Tom Tyler's Kharis in the previous entry. Denied even what little Tyler had (those chilling blacked out eyes), Chaney evokes only chuckles with his response to Bey's sudden change in plans, to go out and abduct the comely female, momentarily grasping for the High Priest before shuffling off in apparent obeyance. At least the fiery climax delivers, in spite of John Hubbard's moronic attempts at inept heroism, Chaney's Mummy earning a measure of sympathy flailing against the inescapable flames. Included in Universal's popular SHOCK! package of classic horror films issued to television in the late 50s, The Mummy's Tomb made only four appearances on Pittsburgh's Chiller Theater- Mar 8 1969 (following 1953's Phantom from Space), Jan 11 1975 (preceding 1956's She Devil), Dec 27 1975 (following 1965's A Study in Terror), and Oct 22 1977 (following 1972's The Spectre of Edgar Allan Poe).
