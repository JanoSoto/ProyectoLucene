The actors give you most of the enjoyment; a very good music score adds quite a lot. But, unfortunately, the screenplay hardly helps.No-Limit Texas Hold 'Em is supposed to be the real star here, I guess... But most of us will just dismiss this as poker hyperbole. The Cadillac of Poker is a title I do not respect; I don't even like Cadillacs. The game is the all-surrounding ocean in which the actor-players swim, but it is just... a... game... after all, folks. Yeah, the cameo appearances of real-life Poker All-Stars (so-called) are supposed to awe us. Sorry; I'm not at all awed. Their whole life is, I think, mere sleaze.But there is an impressive list of top supporting actors Gretchen Mol, Martin Landau, John Malkovich, Edward Norton, John Turturro... All provide a fine foundation for Matt Damon's great job in the leading role. These good folks help to rescue the viewing experience.I finally figured out why I always like watching such films as Rounders, The Hustler, and The Color of Money. Objectively, all movies of this kind just over-glorify games to the point where they take on life-threatening proportions. I know better than to gamble, but these films deliver vicarious thrills without the dangers.I bought this DVD at a $5 cut-out bin. Just the right price. Enjoyable, even with repetition. 7 out of 10.
