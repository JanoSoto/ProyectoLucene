The story, although true, is trite and cliched, and nothing is done in the flick to make it any more than that.Robin Williams plays Patch Adams, a young doctor who goes against the grain and wants to do things his way, as opposed to the way of all the uncaring, cold-hearted, robot doctors around him.  Which means, operating under the theory that laughter is the best medicine, he tries to make his patients laugh.   Wow...what a daring idea.And they do laugh. Along the way, he meets a pretty but stand-offish girl, pursues her, and after he convinces her that he is a nice guy who won't mistreat her, gets her.   While at school Patch pulls some pretty outrageous stunts, all in the name of light-heartedness and laughter.  He opens up his own hospital for anybody who needs free medical attention of any kind.   After a tragedy hits, he rebounds and keeps on plugging away, establishing his own Gesundheidt Institute.A heart-warming story in real life, but it just doesn't translate well to the screen.  Williams is too old to play a romantic lead, at least too old for his screen partner, Monica Potter.  Potter plays too much of a cold fish to make us care about her.  And for some reason, after she rudely ignores Williams' sincere and well-intentioned advances, she suddenly changes into a woman who is trusting enough to visit a lunatic in his home, alone.Bob Gunton, as the dean of the medical school, practically reprises his role from The Shawshank Redemption.   The joke about the visiting gynecologists was so obvious and predictable, it was dumb. But the most annoying thing about this movie was the music.  When Adams is clowning around in the children's cancer ward, and they begin to smile, the music attempts to evoke a sense of wonder, as if this has got to be the first time these kids ever smiled in their lives.  Please.   I'm sure at one time or another one of those horrible, cold, uncaring doctors portrayed in the film once said something nice to the kids.  Smiling and laughter are indeed nice things, but don't try to make us think that Patch Adams is the only savior in the world who can supply them.Sentimentality is nice is measured doses; this movie is like a dumptruck unloading its cargo of syrup on us.  This is not a bad movie; it's just that its weak points overwhelm its overall niceness.
