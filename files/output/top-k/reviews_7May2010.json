Other pundits applauded director Oliver Stone for his truthful account of the Vietnam War. Of course, these songs of praise largely occurred in America. Elsewhere in the world, such films were viewed as just more tedious propaganda, which served only to further rob entire generations of a right to factual information and further mythologise a deliberately obfuscated war.But what's worse is the way these films purport to be anti-war, but then treat war as a coming-of-age ritual, a rights of passage into manhood in which our heroes endure exciting action sequences and then, at least in Platoon's case, benefit from these experiences (as explained in Platoon's excruciating final voice-over).These films covertly endorse war, serving up tales of a rag-tag bunch of racially diverse guys who don't know what they're fighting for but are nevertheless willing to die for their brothers. Elsewhere the horrors which these soldiers commit are simply dismissed as acts of temporary insanity, rather than systemic atrocities ordered from above. Worse still is the way these films tend to treat Vietnam as a lost war, but a noble one, America simply guilty of being overly generous to a point of naivety, the Vietnamese population &#x96; portrayed as primal and barbaric - ultimately to blame for the pain inflicted upon the American psyche. The historical truth, of course, is the opposite the US sided with French Imperialism before the war, was neither supported by Northern Vietnam or the South, did everything it could to scuttle elections and unification, disobeyed Geneva mandates, propped up puppet dictators, artificially and deliberately divided a nation, killed over 4 million Vietnamese, raped the country, engaged in large scale torture, bombing, war-crimes and detainments, faked terrorist acts, funded and armed warlords, forced the displacement of five million, and violently subverted the will of a 80 percent majority who wanted democratic communism. But that's how the US, in tandem with the Imperial powers of yesteryear, habitually operates vote for who we don't want and we crush you. The truth is, most films touted as being Vietnam war films, aren't really about the Vietnam War; they're simply about confused and anguished Americans. Platoon, like First Blood, presented itself as an attempt to reconcile Americans with what had happened in Vietnam. But unlike First Blood, which brought Vietnam back home and forced Americans to confront the scars, Platoon yanks us back to Asia and invites us to experience the everyday truths of how soldiers experienced the war, the film designed to heal the wounds of a great nation undeservedly defeated at the hands of a poverty-stricken third world country (the notion that America was defeated is itself mythology. America achieved its real goals in Vietnam, in much the same way it did in Iraq, another supposedly failed war).So at its core, Platoon is a fairly straightforward morality play. Chris, played by Charlie Sheen, is a young soldier who must (like his character in Stone's Wall Street) choose between two fathers. The first father is Sgt Elias, a tough but gentle sergeant, and the second is Sgt Barnes, an evil brute. Elias represents the mud-stained American ideal, whilst Barnes represents a kind of corrupt devil who believes that men of principle are weak and that evil is within everyone.The film ends with two successive apocalypses. In the first, Elias is abandoned and dies like Christ, a horde of Vietcong devils engulfing him whilst Chris betrays him and angelically rise up into the skies. But this is a false resurrection. The last good man &#x96; the moral heart of America &#x96; has been left behind to die on the cross, leaving Chris alone with Barnes, a kind of demonic God.To salvage his soul, Chris must thus venture back into the jungle-hell, avenge Elias and kill Barnes, an incident which takes place in the film's final apocalypse. Here, amongst the devilish shadows of the Vietcong, Chris confronts Elias and kills him, before being once again lifted up into the skies. In Stone's mythology, America is neither fighting Vietnam nor defeated by it. Rather, America is struggling to confront and dispatch its own demons, that of collective memory and national guilt. She then re-learns how to be a good warrior nation.The devil sergeant destroyed and the Christ hero avenged, Chris(t) frees America and is then lifted off into the sunset like a body resurrected into some easier, more comfortable tomorrow. I have felt like the child of these two fathers, Chris then says. We did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves, and the enemy was within us. Those of us who made it have an obligation to build again, to teach to others what we know and to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness and meaning to this life. And so Platoon dissolves defeat and serves up a cathartic experience in which memory is erased and the American dream persists. Elsewhere the film is resolutely goofy, with Barber's Adagio for Strings overused (cribbed from Elephant Man), too much romanticised insanity, goofy poetry, high-school symbolism and the kind of macho posturing that now seems silly post Tropic Thunder, Hot Shots and Full Metal Jacket's self-aware caricatures. Furthermore, Stone throws in every clich√© (the village trial, the racist, the southern soldiers, the ineffective officer who almost always gets their men killed, the dope smoking, the war-as-being-high aesthetic etc) known to man. He'd direct the superior Born on the Fourth of July some years later.6\/10 &#x96; An ingratiating film, rewarding in a very superficial way.

I don't remember liking it much at the time (made me uncomfortable and queasy actually) and in fact, the only thing I really remembered from the film itself was the big red devil. Perhaps I wasn't sophisticated enough then to enjoy it properly so why not see it again as an adult and give it a second shake...My main opinion during and after the screening (of the director's cut) was that although the decors and the makeup of the creatures are great even by today's standards, that the movie dragged, mostly in the second half. It felt long and I even yawned a few times. I don't know if it's because the pace is wrong, the film lacks action or the story is not engrossing enough but I was bored too often. I also expect some kind of sense of wonder in fantasy films. It happened with the unicorns, although unfortunately their horns were wobbly at first breaking the illusion, and it did happen with the grand entrance of the devil (seen on the cover). It did not happen much other than that. I loved the devil played by Tim Curry in heavy costume and makeup making him unrecognizable. His deep operatic yet comforting voice (slightly modified) is perfect, his expressions are very good and his movements are quite believable. He's the best representation of a traditional devil I've ever seen. Although the main human actors are played earnestly and rather well by Mia Sara and a young Tom Cruise, I was mesmerized by the character of Honeythorn Gump, the apparent leader of the small fairy-folk. He looks like a child but his big expressive eyes, his often severe facial expressions and the way he moves are reminiscent of someone older, kind of appropriate for an elf having lived for a long time. The actor playing Gump was 19 years old which would explain some of his performance. I found him fascinating yet somewhat sinister. I didn't find the comic-relief goblins and gnomes particularly appealing or interesting. To be fair, they were buried under tons of makeup making them less expressive.I watched the director's cut on DVD and the normal shorter US version afterwards. I will not go in details on the differences here but those interested can check this link  http\/\/www.figmentfly.com\/legend\/different4c.html . Neither version is perfect but I think I preferred the director's cut in part because of the classical music score (instead of Tangerine Dream's new age synthesizer remade soundtrack for North America). The relationship between the princess and Jack (Tom Cruise) is also more ambiguous, my favorite character other than Darkness, the elf (?) Gump, has more screen time, the appearance of Darkness is not spoiled right at the beginning making his first real entrance a lot more dramatic and the fun swamp sorceress is there longer. On the other hand, with the shorter US theatrical version, you are less likely to find your mind wandering or being bored In closing, Ridley Scott the director said he was proud of his film despite all its problems (main set burning, big commercial flop and critically panned at the time being a few) and that at least, he managed to get that kind of film (fantasy fairy-tale) out of his system. Not the most ringing endorsement if you ask me... Scott might be proud but I would not call Legend really good even today. it's passable but it pales in comparison to other fantasy films of the eighties (Willow, Princess Bride, Neverending Story (only the first one), Labyrinth, etc) that should be rented or purchased long before Legend. However, Legend has several redeeming features pushing it above the lower dregs of that genre. Legend was middle-of-the-pack for that era but suffered from expectations that were too high.Rating  5 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"7 May 2010","score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" I first saw this celluloid fairy tale back when I was a kid in theatres.

I could have done without the hour long wedding scene, but the reason I really don't like it is that it served little purpose... The Godfather wedding is almost as long, but it deeply informs you about the characters... watching the Deer Hunter wedding was like watching someone's wedding video, and it didn't tell you much about the characters... there are many scenes like this in this movie Now, I tend to agree. The wedding, which takes up like the first third of the film, was not an effective way to get me to care about the characters. In fact, it caused me to get bored early on, and the war scenes had to un-bore me. Luckily, those are really good. But yes, the film as a whole is long for no good reason, and rather than being suspenseful, becomes tedious. An edit cutting 20-30 minutes out would have done wonders for me.And don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with long films. Three hours is fine, sometimes even four hours (Das Boot and Lawrence of Arabia) is enjoyable. This one just didn't live up to the reputation, and I don't think it allowed DeNiro or Walken to shine.

With this I mean that this movie does not feature the most popular and beautiful Hollywood persons of its days. It lets the characters and the whole romantic aspect of the movie work out far better, as in being more realistic, likable and effective.This movie should be far more recognizable for the majority of people than the usual romantic-drama. People should be able to connect with its characters and I also like how the movie does not attempt to let anything some better or more beautiful than it is in real life. It's a quite powerful movie, without ever getting or trying to be melodramatic. It's really not an heavy movie to watch and actually is being quite light-hearted for most of its time.It's a real cute movie to watch, which is mainly thanks to its two main leads, who fall for each other. Both have pretty much given up on ever getting married, which was a big issue it seems back in those days. Yes, lots of aspects are being pretty much outdated by today's society standards but it's pretty easy to get into this movie and understand all of the issues that are being handled in it.The movie is quite simple with its concept but it handles quite a few issues. You're often getting views from different perspectives. For instance Marty his friends seem to have other priorities with life and women than Marty seems to have and Marty's mother gets more and more worried that her role as a mother and woman will be over once Marty gets settled. It's not just a simple love story of boy meets girl but more as well of what happens to his surroundings when a boy finally meets a girl. His whole view and priorities in life seem to change and he needs to make some choices between what is safe for him and what he truly wants. There are lot of issues being handled in this movie, which gives the story multiple layers. Far more and much deeper than you would expect from an only about 90 minutes short movie. The overall movie gets to made believable and likable due to especially its two leads but all of the other actors in general as well. It seemed like a perfectly cast movie to me, in which not all of the actors seem to be full professionals but this makes them all rather believable as 'real' people in this movie. Ernest Borgnine truly deserved his Oscar for his role in this movie. I have never seen him giving a better performance in anything. You really feel and understand the characters, just by often only looking at them.It's also a really well made movie. Appearantly it was a very cheap one to make and not much was ever expected from it.

Kar Wai Wong did something odd with the film, it has the feel of Nashville (1975) but the only connecting part is the fish and chips shop. You feel like you just got a two for one from the video store. I had to watch this movie twice to get it all because it could play like two short fifty minutes films. Chungking Express is a movie that will make you think just trying to understand how the actors and the plot all fit together. Someone said it like the French new wave meets New Asian cinema and after watching Chungking Express, I would have to agree. Spoiler AlertThe first part of the movie is about a cop 223 who has given his girlfriend one month to come back to him. May first is the day that he decided that if she does not come back to him then it is over but each night you goes to a store to buy pineapple that expires on May 1. The second half of the movie is about cop 663 who somewhat just goes through life and takes it how it is. He is also having girl trouble. This time he take some advice about giving his girlfriend a choice on what he brings her to eat. After she leaves him, a new girl at the shop takes a fancy to him and starts breaking in to his house and changing things. When he finally makes a move on the new girl, she tells him to meet her in California. He agrees to meet her he heads to the bar called California and she leaves for California in the United States. She leaves him a note and by the time he reads it, it is too late for him to stop her.This was a good movie and you will want to sit down and watch it at least twice just to understand it. Also try to find the shot where the two cops 223 and 663 cross path it make for and exiting time trying to find where the movie crosses its self.

Batman Returns explores common themes of Burton's, and it rivals Edward Scissorhands as being his best work. It makes changes to the Batman legend but not as severe as has been alleged.Visually this movie is masterful. The movie is surreal it's like a nightmare vision. But there's actually usually overlooked substance in addition to style. The central theme of this movie is being a freak or an outcast. The Penguin at one point struggles with Batman, accusing him of being jealous because Penguin is odd physically as well as mentally. Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle also sit on a couch and talk about being strange, with Selina making a true but odd statement that sickos are committed. In this movie, two freaks find each other and discover they can feel a connection with another person. The movie goes on to argue that when you find out that you're a creep, you can go either way- you can fight for what's right or give into anger, hatred and a drive for revenge.Being pushed around can make you a monster it happened to Penguin who was dropped into a sewer and to Catwoman who was thrown out a window. But giving into darkness will destroy you- the Penguin at the end pushes the button to set off his missiles, and this destroys his whole world. Meanwhile, Catwoman misses out on her happy ending. The only character in the movie who appears to be truly evil is the businessman Max Shreck, who manipulates and abuses- and when you do that, one day you may just face the consequences. Shreck gets fried.The movie is packed with quotable dialogue Ah, the direct approach. I admire that in a man with a mask. How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless? One of my favourite quips is from a security guard who says he doesn't know whether to open fire or fall in love. There's much twisted humour to enjoy.The music, too, helps make this movie great. This includes the tragic music that plays at the ending, and sexy, mysterious music for Catwoman. A song that plays at the dance and over the end credits also fits Catwoman, being dark and sexy.I know Batman fans were disappointed in that the caped crusader kills a couple goons; the character is today expected to have a no-killing rule, although he didn't in the first Batman comics. Still, note Batman doesn't kill except when in combat- when you have captured an enemy (Shreck at the end), killing becomes unnecessary and dangerous, a mere act of revenge. Also said fans may not like the Penguin being a freak in the sewer- but he *is* still a crime boss who works in secret while trying to join higher society (in this case by running for mayor); he still retains his love of birds and umbrellas.This is with apologies to Christopher Nolan, but Batman Returns remains my favourite Batman movie. I don't hate Nolan for not being Burton- on the contrary, I enjoyed Batman Begins and The Dark Knight and thought they surpassed Batman '89. But Batman Returns is an entirely different creature- it captures the anguish and glories of the modern freak. It's a tragedy masked as a superhero movie, unique and beautiful.

The twin sisters, in fact, were thought to have been dead for decades, as their mother, Suyuan Woo (Kieu Chinh) was forced to leave them, as infants, by a roadside because she was too sick and weak to carry them and had no automobile or other transport. For years, Suyuan wondered what became of these babies she unwillingly gave up, and it haunted her up until the end of her life. Only now, four months after her death, have the 2 women been located, and June, both with joy and trepidation, is going to meet them and tell them about their mother.Up until today's party, June believed that she really didn't know or understand her late mother. She bristled as a child at her mother's insistence that she learn to play piano and compete in talent shows at school. June believed that Suyuan was disappointed in her daughter's life, her career path, her choices, and felt inferior to the daughter of Suyuan's best friend Lindo Jong (Tsai Chin).But Lindo's daughter Waverly Jong (Tamlyn Tomita), as uppity as she could be towards June both before and after adulthood, did not have the easiest time with her mother either. A chess prodigy at age 7, Waverly felt constantly pressured and painfully embarrassed by Lindo's constant bragging about her daughter's extraordinary talents. The generation gap and cultural differences cause more than a few verbal spats between them, and Lindo feels as though Waverly is ashamed of her for being Chinese. Lindo's own history with her mother comes into the equation. At age 4, Lindo is betrothed, and at 14, forced to marry a 10 year old who, naturally, is not sexually mature enough to be a husband. Lindo is the one who is blamed by her surly old mother-in-law of course. It is not until young Lindo cleverly schemes her way out of the ridiculous marriage that she finds happiness, though it is not known if she ever saw her mother again.Intertwined into this happy gathering celebrating June's journey to China are the stories of 2 more women, Ying-Ying and her daughter Lena St. Clair. At 16, Ying-Ying (France Nuyen) falls madly in love with the local ladykiller Lin Xiao (a dubbed Russell Wong), only to find out shortly that he is an abusive, hateful cad who brings women into their home at all hours. Ying-Ying's heart is broken, but when she accidentally drowns their infant boy, it is shattered, and for a few years, she lives in a state of mental catatonia. After her mother's recovery later on, Lena, the daughter (Lauren Tom) finds herself in a rather odd marriage to an accountant (Michael Paul Chan), based more on mathematical equality than love and affection. Ying-Ying, knowing her daughter is heading for a life of misery and lovelessness, intervenes.The other friend of Suyuan is An-Mei Hsu (Lisa Lu), and her daughter Rose (Rosalind Chao). Rose's once happy marriage to Ted Jordan (Andrew McCarthy) is ending, and An-Mei sees a disturbing pattern of behavior in her daughter that reminds her of her own mother (Vivian Wu). If a person feels they are of little value compared to someone else, it is easy to take advantage of them and abuse their goodness. An-Mei recalls her mother's terrible life sixty years earlier, first widowed by An-Mei's father and then the victim of one of the most evil conspiracies I've ever seen in film, and finally (and most horribly), disowned by her own parents. And An-Mei desperately explains to Rose that she must stand up and be counted instead of letting people walk all over her. The outcome of this story is on the upbeat, thankfully, otherwise I would have said it was the most bittersweet of all the stories.But it's not. The most haunting story in the film is that of the late Suyuan. War has broken out and she hastily gathers her most important belongings and her precious twin daughters. Without a car, she is forced to carry them in a wheelbarrel for miles and miles. She is weak and feverish, and eventually, the wheels of the wheelbarrel break and she tries in vain to carry the babies in her arms. Her strength gone, she leaves her little girls on the side of a rural road, praying that her note of instructions will be read and that she will see her children again.But she does not.

She bristled as a child at her mother's insistence that she learn to play piano and compete in talent shows at school. June believed that Suyuan was disappointed in her daughter's life, her career path, her choices, and felt inferior to the daughter of Suyuan's best friend Lindo Jong (Tsai Chin).But Lindo's daughter Waverly Jong (Tamlyn Tomita), as uppity as she could be towards June both before and after adulthood, did not have the easiest time with her mother either. A chess prodigy at age 7, Waverly felt constantly pressured and painfully embarrassed by Lindo's constant bragging about her daughter's extraordinary talents. The generation gap and cultural differences cause more than a few verbal spats between them, and Lindo feels as though Waverly is ashamed of her for being Chinese. Lindo's own history with her mother comes into the equation. At age 4, Lindo is betrothed, and at 14, forced to marry a 10 year old who, naturally, is not sexually mature enough to be a husband. Lindo is the one who is blamed by her surly old mother-in-law of course. It is not until young Lindo cleverly schemes her way out of the ridiculous marriage that she finds happiness, though it is not known if she ever saw her mother again.Intertwined into this happy gathering celebrating June's journey to China are the stories of 2 more women, Ying-Ying and her daughter Lena St. Clair. At 16, Ying-Ying (France Nuyen) falls madly in love with the local ladykiller Lin Xiao (a dubbed Russell Wong), only to find out shortly that he is an abusive, hateful cad who brings women into their home at all hours. Ying-Ying's heart is broken, but when she accidentally drowns their infant boy, it is shattered, and for a few years, she lives in a state of mental catatonia. After her mother's recovery later on, Lena, the daughter (Lauren Tom) finds herself in a rather odd marriage to an accountant (Michael Paul Chan), based more on mathematical equality than love and affection. Ying-Ying, knowing her daughter is heading for a life of misery and lovelessness, intervenes.The other friend of Suyuan is An-Mei Hsu (Lisa Lu), and her daughter Rose (Rosalind Chao). Rose's once happy marriage to Ted Jordan (Andrew McCarthy) is ending, and An-Mei sees a disturbing pattern of behavior in her daughter that reminds her of her own mother (Vivian Wu). If a person feels they are of little value compared to someone else, it is easy to take advantage of them and abuse their goodness. An-Mei recalls her mother's terrible life sixty years earlier, first widowed by An-Mei's father and then the victim of one of the most evil conspiracies I've ever seen in film, and finally (and most horribly), disowned by her own parents. And An-Mei desperately explains to Rose that she must stand up and be counted instead of letting people walk all over her. The outcome of this story is on the upbeat, thankfully, otherwise I would have said it was the most bittersweet of all the stories.But it's not. The most haunting story in the film is that of the late Suyuan. War has broken out and she hastily gathers her most important belongings and her precious twin daughters. Without a car, she is forced to carry them in a wheelbarrel for miles and miles. She is weak and feverish, and eventually, the wheels of the wheelbarrel break and she tries in vain to carry the babies in her arms. Her strength gone, she leaves her little girls on the side of a rural road, praying that her note of instructions will be read and that she will see her children again.But she does not. Suyuan dies not knowing if her 2 girls lived beyond their infancy. There are few situations in movies that I've found sadder than this one, but Suyuan's daughter June, taking the place of her mother, goes to China and fulfills her late mother's cherished dream come true.The emotions of this film are almost too rich at times, especially with regards to Ying-Ying's, An-Mei and her mother's, Rose's, and above all, Suyuan's life stories. There will always be those who think of this film as too corny or just another chick flick. Me, I don't mind OD'ing on emotion. If you're like me, you'll love this film for years to come.

It's the one with the boat chase down the Thames, the flying snowmobiles, the x-ray sunglasses, Denise Richards, the oil pipeline, Q's farewell, the highlands castle headquarters, the buzz-saw helicopters, and the tipped-downward nuclear submarine.Pierce Brosnan returns for his third outing as James Bond. Denise Richards plays a nuclear physicist named Christmas Jones. Sophie Marceau plays Elektra King, the seductive daughter of an oil tycoon. Robert Carlyle plays Renard, a terrorist with a bullet slowly moving through his brain. Robbie Coltrane, best known today as Hagrid from Harry Potter, makes a welcome return as a Russian mobster. This film also marks the final appearance of Desmond Llewelyn as the beloved gadget master Q. After nearly forty years of Bond films, Q is set to retire, leaving a hapless John Cleese as his replacement.I always kinda liked this film. It's my second favorite Pierce Brosnan 007 movie, after GOLDENEYE (1995). It delivers some great super-spy action, like the London boat chase in the opening sequence and the skiing ambush. (Those para-hawk snowmobile-copters are pretty cool.) Bond has quite a few jams to get out of, and explosions to avoid. The vertical submarine sequence is inventive. I also found the villain interesting. Renard is slowly dying from a bullet in his head and his character has a certain tragic quality to him. He may seem lightweight for a Bond villain, but who's really the master villain?Another interesting thing about this film is that M is given a larger role. In the old days M would give Bond his mission, provide some exposition, and that was that. In THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH, Judi Dench's M character becomes a significant piece of the plot. She finds herself involved in the goings on, rather than watching everything from the sidelines. In this movie, for the first time since Dench was cast as a female M in GOLDENEYE, we get a hint of M's maternal instincts. The story makes use of the fact that M is a woman.I was glad to see Robbie Coltrane reprise his GOLDENEYE role, this time as a casino owner and with a goatee. His supporting character adds some humor and fleshes out the Bond universe. It was also nice to see a fitting send-off for Desmond Llewelyn, who'd played Q since the Sean Connery days. (Llewelyn would die shortly after the film's release.) And say what you will about Denise Richards's performance, she knows how to rock the tight tank top and shorts look. Bond girls' acting has been spotty over the years. The main thing is that they're nice to look at.While the film isn't perfect, THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH is certainly one of the better James Bond outings. The one-liners range from bad to groan-inducing, but all in all it's a well-crafted film. The acting is top-notch (mostly), the characters show some complexity, and there are lots of exciting James Bond moments to enjoy. It's a serious thriller with twists and turns and great action. I much prefer this adventure to Brosnan's previous film TOMORROW NEVER DIES (1997), which just fell flat for me. It's not in my Bond top five, but THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH is a sort of sentimental favorite of mine. It's a modern James Bond adventure in the classic tradition.

Yes, it is true, so I was not familiar with the style that he was going to use, but dang, this film was spectacular! The writing and directing really captures your full attention. What I love was that the first 40 minutes or so there was nothing about it that was in any way horror, but instead gave all the characters perfect development and mystery. The dialogue was brilliant and clever, and the characters fleshed out strongly to make us care for them. When the horror started, it completely amazed me how Hitchcock could make the transition from such a light, and fairly romantic film to a terror and suspenseful film, but that is exactly what he does. The cinematography is brilliant, as are the performances. Suzanne Pleshette was the stand-out to me, creating a very mysterious and somewhat likable, yet at the same time very hidden and obscured, character.

It's labeled as belonging to the science fiction genre and most of it does take place on a space station, but it's more a philosophical love story. Kris Kelvin (Donatas Banionis) knows that the Hari (Natalya Bondarchuk) he meets on the space station isn't the woman whom he loved, but in time he realizes that he loves her and can't let go of her. He even mentions that she's better than the real Hari was; probably because she was created from his memories. Solaris features very few special effects. It's not like Star Wars or even 2001 A Space Odyssey. If entertainment is all you're looking for then you probably won't enjoy the film. But it's not boring. In fact it's one of Tarkovsky's most accessible films. It's two and a half hours long, but once I got into it I couldn't stop watching it. It's like the film absorbs you.Some gorgeous images of nature are featured, and the space station's interiors look good too. The whole film seemed like a dream to me. There are details that you pick up only if you watch it more than once. The actors are good in their roles. This is a Tarkovsky film after all. The pretty Bondarchuk is a delight to see on screen. It's often said that author Stanislaw Lem didn't like Tarkovsky's film because it became different from the story in the novel. However, if Tarkovsky shot Solaris according to the novel it would not have been a great film. Its brilliance isn't in the story but in Tarkovsky's vision. Solaris is one of the greatest science fiction films. It especially influenced Russian filmmakers. The film gets a high recommendation from me.
