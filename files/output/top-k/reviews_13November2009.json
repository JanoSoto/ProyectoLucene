The second is that director Paul Morrissey could talk the legs off a centipede which, again, suits our purposes down to the ground, as you learn a lot about this movie over a good two hours. In the screen-test we see footage of Flesh For Frankenstein's Srdjan Zelenovic auditioning for the role of Dracula (before Udo Kier ultimately stepped into his over-sized shoes). Morrissey was clearly very taken with the towering and aloof actor, who he recalls as having an extraordinarily deep voice, as if coming from the grave. You pay attention to a man like that. We also learn that the aristocratic Zelenovic grew up in a Soviet slave camp (aka Yugoslavia), that his brother (who was just as tall) was a basketball player; and that his father was a general in Tito's army. The production stills segment (featuring some great photos of Morrissey and Kier) lasts a good 25 minutes, affording Morrissey more time to discuss casting, characters, and behind-the-scenes stuff. Among other things, we learn that cameo performer Roman Polanski wanted to write his own part, rather than improvise; and that Udo and Joe Dallesandro were given haircuts so they could start shooting the minute Flesh wrapped. A fan of spontaneity, Morrissey wasted no time in bringing his next project to the screen. Dracula started shooting at 1pm after finishing Frankenstein an hour before. I suppose if they'd ask me to make a third right afterwards, I'd probably have done it. The real meat is in the director's commentary proper - which is slightly confusing until you work out these are three separately recorded interviews edited (not entirely seamlessly) together. Mostly, this works. Sometimes, as with the juxtaposition of crusty but avuncular film historian Maurice Yacowar and the more down-home Morrissey, it renders matters redundant. Kier's own introduction I'm Udo Kier, I'm Dracula, I'm on the search for the blood of a virgin and I hope you enjoy it, comes quite out of the blue, and makes you jump out of your skin. I didn't want to overplay it and play Dracula when I'd just played Frankenstein, Kier recalls. Once persuaded, Morrissey next explained he'd have to lose 10 kilos. I said, 'I know how to do it.' I just didn't eat anymore. And he ended up in a wheelchair. Still, he appears to have relished the chance to star in something other than the more sombre fare he was used to. Dracula was important for me, it was seen by a lot of people. If you make a film in German, where's the audience? Some old guys hiding away in Brazil, if you know what I mean! Yes, Udo, we know what you mean. Some of those Nazis probably got off on Joe Dallesandro's heaving buttocks too. Elsewhere he comments that vomiting blood looks so great when you have a tuxedo on. Look at the red... it's beautiful. Sometimes, Udo, you seem like a strange and scary man. Morrissey, often introduced by a disembodied woman's voice, reveals that the castle belonged to someone who was in a madhouse and was rented out; and that, I did almost no research - I respect the legend, but I wasn't going to have my hands tied. Yacowar's commentary, though erudite, can occasionally become intrusive, and an unwitting parody of 'Cahiers Du Cin√©ma'-speak, for a discussion about what is essentially a trashy horror-comedy. There's an inexplicable psychology between their stripping in the fields and their sexual banter, he notes of the Di Fiori sisters, while the combination of blood and bread makes the scene an infernal parody of communion. Morrissey must really enjoy the sex scenes played with Marxist polemics. He is sexually exploiting the class that exploits him economically. This sequence is so beautifully photographed, Morrissey interrupts. But Yacowar is far from finished. For both of the vampire's climaxes Morrissey uses quiet piano music. This gives the blood-taking act the calm of satiety and culmination... the toilet is Morrissey's personal metaphor for the moral vacuum that has been created by liberal self indulgence. Later he'll concede, Maybe I'm reading too much into that line. I usually do. He's mostly good value, however, especially for priceless stuff like, This is a very elegant composition, with the little mound of breast in the foreground, romantically heaving. To summarise, then Keir? There's communism in it, there's sex in it, there's revolution in it, there's aristocracy in it, and there's a vampire in it. Thanks, Udo. Final thoughts, Paul? It's looking for the ambivalence of serious and silly, the meaningless and meaningful. And last but not least, Maurice. Who, for once, seems totally lost for words. Whatever it is, he reckons, it's some sort of a vampire movie. Got that? But it raises more questions than it answers. Yes? It's a kind of strange tribute to the horror movie mentality. Uh-huh. A little bit horrible in some parts, and enjoyable in others. Come, Maurice, you're simply not reaching. It's not one simple thing. Bless.

All these things lend great atmosphere to the movie, as well as the musical score, but other than that, this movie didn't terrify me like the best horror films do. THere are just long points in the movie where nothing really happens. THere is dread, I'll agree, but there are also other scenes that just don't go anywhere. THe interview itself in the beginning seems too drawn out, taking up entirely too much of the movie if you ask me.Some people want to talk about the acting, but it seemed entirely too wooden. Shelly Duvall as Wendy is weak and dull, and Jack Nicholson as Jack Torrance doesn't become interesting until he starts going crazy and acting like he does in most of his movies. Danny Lloyd, who plays the son Danny, has a telepathic ability called the Shining and has daily conversations with an imaginary friend named Tony. THis could've been a little more interesting, but never goes far enough to really catch your interest.THe plot is simple enough. Jack Torrance is offered a job as caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, and brings his wife and son with him because it will be many months of seclusion with just the three of them in a large ominous hotel. THe set-up is great, and Stanley Kubrick uses the steady cam to perfection in this movie to show us how spooky this large hotel is. As Jack slowly goes insane he starts seeing the ghosts that haunt this large hotel which comes first in the form of one ghostly bartender and then transforms into a whole ballroom of spooks. It is only Danny though, with THe Shining, who sees the twin girls. Many of you already know what happened to them, but I will not spoil it for those who haven't. THere is also the telepathic link that Danny has with the hotel's cook named Dick Halloran and played by Scathman Crothers. Once again not much is given about this special ability shared between the two. It is glanced over while Dick and Danny talk alone for the first time at the beginning of the movie, but otherwise goes nowhere else, except to bring Dick back from Florida when things go very bad closer to the end.As I've said, the setting is great, the visuals are wondrous at building dread and atmosphere, but the acting and script are rather weak because nothing is ever explained and the actors, other than Nicholson's character, really never change. Then again, upon first seeing Jack Torrance, I thought he was a little loopy then and just becomes way more loopy as the long drawn out story pushes to the end. In my opinion The SHining has enough good points to be recommended, but can not quite match the perfection of a movie like Alien which also starts out slowly, but becomes much more fast paced and terrifying as it leads to its conclusion, and it also has better acting.

I'm ashamed to admit that I can sometimes be reluctant to sit down on a weeknight and watch a wordy, black-and-white film; when my fianc√©e explained to me that the entire movie is set in one room I sighed and settled myself in for the long haul.Luckily what I watched was a brilliantly made, flawlessly acted masterpiece of tension that would not let me drift from the screen for even a single second. I have honestly not seen such an ensemble of brilliant actors working together like that for a long long time, if ever. This is a superb film and one that has left me thinking deeply about it, and looking forward to seeing it again.If there is one gripe it would be that some of the points raised by Henry Fonda as the original dissenting voice among the jurors, would surely have been made by even a bad defence lawyer (finding out whether the only eyewitness to the murder wore glasses, for example); but the point here is not the innocence or guilt of the boy, but the motives of the men in reaching their opinions on his guilt.Twelve Angry Men is a brilliant set of character studies and one of the finest films I have ever seen.

I went off Terry Gilliam for awhile, can't really say why. I got involved in other stuff, I guess. Anyway, I missed having this masterful film under my belt all these years.Recently I proclaimed 'Tideland' as having superseded 'Brazil' as his masterpiece. Now, in so short a time, 'Twelve Monkey's has snatched the crown from 'Tideland'. All three of these films are solid evidence of Gilliam being one of the great living directors.What is most great about this movie, for me, is that I didn't know what was going to happen next. Nothing about it is predictable, even to the very last shot on the airplane to San Francisco.I began to think this was a modern version of the nightmare classic 'Dead of Night', then, at the very end it turned out to be something quite different. Gilliam has never been a director to explain everything to a supposedly gawp-mouthed public, but relies upon them to be capable of rubbing a couple of brain cells together and figuring it out on their own.My brain cells were so fuddled until the last scene that I gave up trying to second guess the ending. It's a frequently depressing movie, showing modern society as corrupt and violent and cynical. It even began to seem preferable that 99% of the world population should be destroyed by a virus, but somehow, when the credits were running I abandoned that dark thought. It's also a very funny movie, thanks to the very subtle performances of Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt and the scientists living in the future, all of whom seem slightly cracked, like the psychiatrists in the present time. Madelyn Stowe is superb throughout, and near the end of the movie becomes a tremendously moving presence.This story blows holes in all the political-socio bickering that goes on between various factions with their hidden agendas and brings the viewer back to the main point, which is we are alive and it's a miracle, and that's all that matters... make the most of it.Brilliant cast, brilliant music, direction, cinematography, art direction... the whole ball of wax.And Brad Pitt really CAN act when he's working with a great director.A great film.

It gives it audience an inside view of the corruption and the life's of different people that live in Mexico. The translation of the title Amores perro's would be funny which is dogs love but then again translated in a different meaning it would be Life's a bitch. Very interesting title one would think. I feel like the movie is not only about how life a bitch but through several characters in the film but we get to experience how people in different classes live. If you actually pay attention closely, all the characters, in the film have dogs, as pets. Which, to me, tells me, why perhaps the tile is what it is AMORES PERROS. A dog's life is pretty simple but compare to a persons, it complicated and I feel like having both together it helps balance out each other out. Even though each of the characters has a certain problem, they always have their dogs to which they turn to comfort. Another thing I noticed was that even though the dogs were never in the best conditions, they never turn against their owners. Although like people they turn against their own kind, which make it another main plot in the film. Throughout the movie we see how these characters, instead of turning to their love ones in tough circumstance, they stab each other in the back, and for example Octavio falls for Susan his brother wife and then turn against him. Secondly Valeria falls for a man that is taken and he return against his wife and children. Finally we have Chivo who paid to kill a business man whom later we discover that his own brother is who wants him dead. We live in a world where people have no limit to their own selfishness to achieve one own personal goal. However, what makes this film even more mesmerizing is how each of these characters interacts with the others life somehow.

In this film, an ax-wielding maniac targets four high school students who had inadvertently caused the death of one of their friends six years before. One of the unlucky quartet, Nick, is the boyfriend of prom queen Kim, played by Jamie Lee Curtis; what a shame, then, that the anniversary of the tragedy coincides with the night of the big school bash.... Anyway, this film really is a mixed bag at best. It rarely goes far enough in terms of excitement and violence, is filled with false shocks and red herrings, and has a slow buildup that is barely paid off in the picture's final third. With the exception of the plight of Wendy, the bitchiest of the four, whose pursuit by the killer throughout the school and in an underground garage IS quite suspenseful (probably because Wendy is the only one who lasts long enough to show any sign of fear!), and a bravura final five minutes that are memorably off the wall, the picture generates little in the way of thrills. (PERSONAL NOTE TO ASPIRING FILMMAKERS If a character in a horror picture is not afraid, the audience won't be either. Imagine the shower scene in Psycho, if Mother had merely killed Marion Crane while her back was to him. How less effective that scene would have been, without Janet Leigh's classic scream and the fear that was so well conveyed! Sure, the scene would still have been suspenseful, but not nearly as memorable and harrowing. Fear is communicable, and without that identification on the part of the viewer, there are no scares; just buildup and butchery.) What's worse, a side issue regarding Kim becoming aware of Nick's involvement in her sister's death is never resolved, and the talents of both Leslie Nielsen and Antoinette Bower (who will always be Star Trek's Sylvia the witch woman to me!) are squandered in teensy roles. Still, there are compensations. The picture looks great and is well acted by its mainly young cast, and the identity of the killer (virtually every character is suspect) will most likely come as a surprise; I felt sure that I had guessed it for a change, but was wrong, as usual. Director Paul Lynch has given his film some interesting touches also (love that slow dissolve into a blood-red punch bowl!). Thus, Prom Night isn't TOO bad a teen\/slasher flick; certainly better than some I've seen. If anything, the film demonstrates that disco music is good for something after all It makes an impressive backdrop for watching a psycho go berserk!

This is as uplifting and inspiring as cinema gets and if you can't see that then I feel sorry for you. How anyone could not be left with a smile on their face after watching this movie is beyond me.The film's story is actually rather simple. Daniel Rudy Ruettiger grew up in Illinois with one dream...to play football for his beloved Notre Dame Fighting Irish. Unfortunately for Rudy this was essentially an impossible dream. He's much too small to play major college football and, as one character will point out, he possesses hardly a speck of athletic ability. And while he's not much of a football player Rudy isn't much of a student either. He doesn't have the grades to get into community college much less Notre Dame. But what Rudy does have is a seemingly limitless supply of heart and determination. He is going to play football at Notre Dame and nobody will ever convince him otherwise.As we follow Rudy's journey and see all the obstacles put up in his way it is almost unfathomable that he could ultimately succeed. But this is a movie about living the dream. The writer and director are never shy about tugging on the viewer's heartstrings as Rudy's story unfolds. They knew that in order for the movie to ultimately work those watching were going to have to fall in love with their main character. And sure enough, thanks in no small part to a wonderful performance from Sean Astin, Rudy is a character you embrace wholeheartedly. There are more than a few times during the film when you might find yourself with a lump in the throat.

It's a portrait of a man painted so vividly that I bet -- at least since 1970 -- that there are far more historians whose research emphasis is on Gen. George S. Patton than any other war hero\/major military figure. Hollywood has given us any number of unique and enigmatic characters, but none so compelling and quickly gathering of our sympathies as Patton.Patton was an American general in World War II, but more specifically he was fighter, a soldier a man who believed in war as part of human nature. He was also a poet and a war history romantic. He was prideful, he was vulgar, he was both loved and despised. The list goes on, because that's how incredibly complex Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North's character is as well as the layers of depth George C. Scott gives him.Scott refused his much-deserved and won Oscar, but he insisted he didn't belong in an elite category. What he didn't really consider was that sometimes an actor, usually a character actor, comes across a role so perfectly suited to their talents, a part that wouldn't be the same done by any other actor, that greatness happens. Scott found that role. Few actors ever do. He plays Patton with such command yet the more Patton realizes his fallibility, Scott withdraws ever so slightly, bringing the character a tad closer to earth each time, but never losing that essence of pride and self confidence.Patton is a long movie and you spend much of it just craving for Patton to do or say something. From his eternally quotable opening monologue before a backdrop of the American flag onward, we can't see or hear enough of the man. He's utterly fascinating. He speaks American war ideals like they're fundamental truths about the universe. Hippies would be ready to die for their country after listening to that, no matter how many swears he uses. And he never appears crazy. In fact, throughout the film as Patton's commanding officers reprimand him for his behavior including hitting a soldier, we find ourselves wondering why doesn't anyone else see this man's brilliance? He's not nice, but he's right. The idea of Patton as a war man and not a politician plays out then throughout the rest of the film.Honestly, whenever Patton's not on screen and specifically saying something, the film is uninteresting. There's one terrific action moment where Scott, angry at the incompetent British in Morocco, goes outside with his pistol and tries to shoot two German planes down. After that, the war scenes are nothing but random explosions and images without any narrative relevance to the story. In a nearly three hour film, it's fair to consider all the scenes where the best part of the film plays little or no role a bit tedious and pointless.It's impossible to describe in a review the many depths and levels of Patton's character. There are many elements in the story that evolve from and revolve around the man he was that little can be summarized. The most basic piece of this character to understand is that despite how convincing and successful he was as a military figure, his wily and off-kilter ways were always at odds with that success. Essentially, it reveals the many dimension of Patton and the many dimensions of war that require more than just a blood 'n guts attitude.

Hollywood has given us any number of unique and enigmatic characters, but none so compelling and quickly gathering of our sympathies as Patton.Patton was an American general in World War II, but more specifically he was fighter, a soldier a man who believed in war as part of human nature. He was also a poet and a war history romantic. He was prideful, he was vulgar, he was both loved and despised. The list goes on, because that's how incredibly complex Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North's character is as well as the layers of depth George C. Scott gives him.Scott refused his much-deserved and won Oscar, but he insisted he didn't belong in an elite category. What he didn't really consider was that sometimes an actor, usually a character actor, comes across a role so perfectly suited to their talents, a part that wouldn't be the same done by any other actor, that greatness happens. Scott found that role. Few actors ever do. He plays Patton with such command yet the more Patton realizes his fallibility, Scott withdraws ever so slightly, bringing the character a tad closer to earth each time, but never losing that essence of pride and self confidence.Patton is a long movie and you spend much of it just craving for Patton to do or say something. From his eternally quotable opening monologue before a backdrop of the American flag onward, we can't see or hear enough of the man. He's utterly fascinating. He speaks American war ideals like they're fundamental truths about the universe. Hippies would be ready to die for their country after listening to that, no matter how many swears he uses. And he never appears crazy. In fact, throughout the film as Patton's commanding officers reprimand him for his behavior including hitting a soldier, we find ourselves wondering why doesn't anyone else see this man's brilliance? He's not nice, but he's right. The idea of Patton as a war man and not a politician plays out then throughout the rest of the film.Honestly, whenever Patton's not on screen and specifically saying something, the film is uninteresting. There's one terrific action moment where Scott, angry at the incompetent British in Morocco, goes outside with his pistol and tries to shoot two German planes down. After that, the war scenes are nothing but random explosions and images without any narrative relevance to the story. In a nearly three hour film, it's fair to consider all the scenes where the best part of the film plays little or no role a bit tedious and pointless.It's impossible to describe in a review the many depths and levels of Patton's character. There are many elements in the story that evolve from and revolve around the man he was that little can be summarized. The most basic piece of this character to understand is that despite how convincing and successful he was as a military figure, his wily and off-kilter ways were always at odds with that success. Essentially, it reveals the many dimension of Patton and the many dimensions of war that require more than just a blood 'n guts attitude.

Jacob's Ladder is a crazy journey trough the mind of Jacob Singer, the lead character.This psychological thriller plays with perceptions and you're always wondering where is the story going and what is really going on,you'll keep trying to figure out what is real and what is fiction until the answers are finally given to you. And even then one can argue that the movie is open for interpretation.

Hilary Swank filled the void that Brandon's absence created with her Academy Award winning performance. What we have here is a documentary of the events leading up to his murder and what happened to his killers.When dealing with a transgender individual to properly tell the story we have to go back to the cradle to those very first questioning that something is not right with the body I'm in. So it was with Tina Brandon born in Nebraska and raised in a time where she would have had limited access to literature about being transgender. She also was raised in a redneck culture and her male role models were the redneck boys she grew up with. This was to her what it meant to be a man.Before he was murdered at the end of 1993, Tina Brandon reversed her name and started living as Brandon Teena in a nearby town where no one knew him from a previous identity as a woman. As a man Brandon did pretty good with the woman by the accounts in the film and that aroused suspicion that eventually led to tragedy.There were two crimes involving Brandon Teena. The first was a brutal rape when her physical privacy was violated on Christmas Eve and then her murder along with two other people to silence them as witnesses after Brandon Teena brought the complaint of rape on New Year's Eve.Two things I guarantee you will disturb you for all time to come. The first was the total lack of remorse by Brandon's killers, John Lotter and Tom Nissen. They still truly believe that in their heart of hearts they were somehow defending the barriers of male sexuality from unwanted invasion. Secondly it's the total lack of compassion and understanding of transgender issues by the sheriff's department when you hear the sheriff questioning Brandon about the rape. Both these things sad to say aren't a new story for me. I worked 23 years for NYS Crime Victims Board and even today the approach some police take regarding gay\/lesbian\/bisexual\/transgender crime victims is appalling. It's far worse where I live now in Buffalo than in New York City where I'm originally from. That it's not a new a revelatory story for me is another frightening thing.To get the facts as Joe Friday used to say on Dragnet, I suggest you watch the Brandon Teena Story documentary. To flesh out who was Brandon Teena than don't miss Hilary Swank's performance in Boys Don't Cry.This review is dedicated to all the Transgender support groups out there in the world, especially to the Buffalo Belles and Spectrum in my area. They provide an incalculable service to those transgender folks at various stages of their journey. Due to the insurance regulations most will die in the bodies they feel wrongly trapped in.
