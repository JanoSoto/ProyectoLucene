Cunningham, the man behind the chase scene from A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984).In 1957, at Camp Crystal Lake, a young boy drowned. The next year, two of the counselors were murdered which lead to a fire. No one knows who done it. So the camp was closed.Now in 1979, the 13th of April, a naive local re-opens the camp along with 6 other teenage counselors. Throughout the day, they fix up the place & have fun. But at night they are all doomed when an unseen person starts to murder them one by one after they sin.This movie IS classic. It has inspired most of the horror films we watch today. It's also was one of the first slashers featuring teenagers having sex before they die in a rather grisly manner. But that doesn't mean this is a good movie. Does it?Well the storyline is...OK...but really simple. Yet the killer's motive just ruined the whole story. Kind of. Anyway, Friday The 13th (1979) is just another Halloween (1978) rip-off. So that is partly why i don't like it.The start of the film was swell, though the beginning ripped-off the beginning of Halloween (1978). Unlike Halloween (1978), this film was not suspenseful or creepy. Effective? Yes. But it takes more than effective death scenes to make a good slasher film. The direction IS NOT bad like other users have stated. The acting IS NOT bad like other users have stated. The score is really good. The atmosphere is raw like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974). The script is not that good. I agree on that. Also, the villain is not scary like the masked villains from horror flicks before this such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), the underrated Alice Sweet Alice (1975, also known as Communion) or Halloween (1978). Maybe because the killer does NOT wear a mask...but still, the villain could have been better. Speaking of villains, the killer was an OLD LADY. The finale involving the confrontations between Mrs.Voorhees played by Betsy Palmer & the final girl, Alice played by Adrienne King were beyond me. She is an old woman! Just kick the beep out her! Instead, Jasons mother seems to be really strong and Alice seems to be really weak. Another thing frustrated me is that Alice never finishes her off. The stupid b#tch had all these chances yet threw them away. I was happy about her demise in Friday The 13th Part 2 (1981). The b!tch deserved it. There are more stupid things that this stupid girl committed throughout the flick which i couldn't be bothered mentioning. So if you compare this character to Laurie Strode from the Halloween series, of course Laurie Strode is more smart\/likable. She was a good, smart girl in the middle of all the this terror whilst Alice was a stupid girly-girl who wouldn't escape from the murderer even when she had the chances.This picture does have an effective ending, i'll give it that. But the movie is just...bad. Zero story. Zero suspense. Zero characters to care for (encept for the 3rd victim Annie-what a shame she dies) Zero script. I could go oooonn & oooonn & oooonn but i won't.Friday The 13th could have been an OK if the stupid character Alice & the stupid finale didn't exist. Yet they DO exist.........well it is entertaining!At least the gore was good. Not good,-great! We get people getting stabbed, necks being cut & some more imaginative death scenes. But i warn you, the result in the gore department may not be as strong as todays standards so do not keep your expectations high. Anyway the movie is quite violent so...yeah.

It has romance...a real love story. The presidential montage with the incredible music score raking you across a range of motions from a father who messed up, to a dying father to a father saying good bye to his little girl, is just down right brilliant (brings tears to my eyes just writing this...and every time while watching it).The tension building from get go is what makes this movie and the middle 10 minutes probably the most dramatic movie ever.

One senses that director David Cronenberg had no desire to make this film. No desire to tell this tale or refine this script.The plot is simple a man has an accident and wakes up from a five year coma to find that he has psychic powers. He uses these powers to solve a murder, save a boy and kill an evil politician.It's an interesting idea, but the screenplay was written by Jeffrey Boam, a talentless writer who gave us such horrible scripts as Phantom and Tales from the Crypt. The only worthwhile script that Jeffrey Boam wrote was Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and even that managed to severely dumb down what was already a pretty simple series.And so The Dead Zone plays out like a really bad TV movie. None of the characters are developed beyond the superficial, the plot is predictable, the direction ugly, and the acting, with the exception of Christopher Walken, pretty cringe worthy.Luckily David Cronenberg would use the success of The Dead Zone and The Fly to launch a series of far more personal and interesting films.6\/10 &#x96; Television has effectively rendered this movie obsolete. TV shows like The Medium, X-Files, The Mentalist, Ghost Whisperer and even The Dead Zone TV Series, have explored all these paranormal tales from every possible angle. As a result, Cronenberg's film now seems bland and unimaginative. The film packs no surprises, and is at times laughably ridiculous. 80's audiences may have found this interesting, but we've now seen it all before and done better. Brian De Palma's Sisters faced a similar problem, its tale of evil twins now a cliché absorbed by everything from Sesame Street to Baywatch. The reason Sisters is still watchable is because De Palma relies on visuals and camera wizardry. Cronenberg, however, is a man of intellect and is largely uninterested in aesthetics. The result is a badly shot film which is unfortunately also very stupid.

The plot is generally unexciting and unoriginal. But all it needs to be is enough to give this ground- breaking mixture of animation and live action room to reach it's potential -- enough to make sure all the cartoon\/human jokes could be made and all the muscles of the technology flexed. That's what makes Roger Rabbit fascinating the whole way through. You're almost left intrigued only to see if they're going to be able to pull it off the whole movie.Roger Rabbit is a Bugs Bunny rip-off who in this world is a working actor that has a trouble- making reputation. When a toon-film mogul named R.K Maroon wants to send a message to Roger to get his act together, he hires a P.I named Eddie Valiant, the film's whiskey-swilling film noir-esquire protagonist, to follow Roger's red-headed bombshell (and animated) wife, Jessica, who might be having an affair with the head of ACME, the man who owns Toon- Town -- where everything animated lives. When Roger learns of Jessica's affair, it's not long before he's framed for ACME's murder. Valiant reluctantly befriends the rabbit and takes his case.One of the impressive things about the film is it obtained rights to both Warner Bros. and Disney characters. There are countless appearances and part of the fun is picking out which characters are from what.

Not because it's his best film. But rather, because it's his most enduring film, and the series of sequels it spawned are a phenomenon unto itself. That hasn't changed today. And in the early 90's, when Freddy Krueger died in New Line's sixth film, it was an even bigger deal because it was still producing new and somewhat thought-provoking material. People were clearly getting tired of it, but it was still a creative and fairly innovative series. The formula had stretched near to its' breaking point, but the films continued delivering watchable and high concept fantasy sequences, mostly skilled and expensive special effects, spacey music, and inventive kills (as they're known online). It went through several permutations. And each new director brought their own unique take on it, visually. It wasn't what Craven had set out to make in his original, nor did it follow the rules he would have laid down had he stayed involved. But in its' own way, it was always fresh. And for people who got tired of the sleaze of Paramount's Friday the 13th, it was REfreshing as well.The problem with the later sequels was always story. The agonized process of writing and filming Part 4, 1988's The Dream Master, had the films' writing staff turn to the John Hughes school of weepy melodrama and the next two sequels would also feature those same unfortunate, put-upon teens. The angst always came first. Wes Craven decided a new sequel should switch the focus onto some adults for once. His finished product, this 1994 film, was not very successful at the box office. But got the critics raving. Some even gave this sequel more praise than the original. Is it worth it? I think- a little Yes, but a little No as well. Switching the focus to an adult main character is risky. Because teenagers are expected to daydream. As an adult myself, I can tell you that- you spend too much time daydreaming, and you're in deep trouble. Not because dreams take over. But because real life is something you don't turn your back on. Craven covers himself a little by making the main character an actress, living in a very nice, quite big house, doing well in her career. And she does struggle with real life problems as well as the nightmares the film needs her to have.The film is also an experiment with using actual real life people in the film business as actors in the story, playing themselves as they would behave were this film's situation happening in reality. That results in some awkward scenes, though it's in the interest of keeping the film feeling real. It's definitely one of the most realistic movies I've ever seen about an actor or actress's life, though I assume most of Heather Langenkamp's private details were kept out of the movie. She's not actually married to the gorgeous, sexy David Newsom. But she really was a mother and had a stalker. Not that any of that is truly important to the film itself, it's just part of what Craven wrote in, knowing that it was relevant to actresses in the movie business. Many TV and film actresses from the 80's and 90's were beginning to attract weird, obsessive fans. None moreso than women who had appeared in successful low budget horror films of the time- including Halloween's Nancy Kyes, Friday the 13th's Adrienne King, and Halloween 4 and 5's Danielle Harris.As a formula, this New Nightmare is nowhere near as visually interesting or cool as the previous films. It trades in that creepy, dark feel of intangibility, and trademark surreal Alice in Wonderland style (especially of Renny Harlin's sequel, The Dream Master), for a sense of complete reality. Where the nightmares look like everyday life. This of course, was better done in 1979's Phantasm, not to mention Dario Argento's extraordinary films. But, it was the 1990's. And things were starting to get gritty and hi-tech. So, New looks slick. But it's not as compelling or dreamlike. Or fun, as the previous films. However, it is an improvement on the formula in a few regards. The acting is much better. And though the film takes quite a while to get the viewer into the story, when it does, it becomes progressively more interesting. The film really begins to cook though once Miko Hughes' Dillon character winds up in a hospital, being tested by a presumptuous pediatrician with a distaste for Hollywood celebrities' choices when raising their kids. It's a devilishly perfect method of slipping in some social commentary on how authority figures impose their views of people who work in the horror genre onto others. As well as the character outright saying she thinks horror movies make children unstable.The film is a very good thriller, but isn't dangerous or dark enough to be a horror film. Another bone of contention is the film's wholly irritating sound design, from the bloated and bulky orchestra music score, to lame and clichéd booming bass crashes. This film already has an issue with choosing dozens of false scares over real ones, I wonder what they were thinking by making so many of the sounds so bass heavy. That doesn't make the film any more exciting. Nor does the film's big, stiff and unimpressive mythologically-set 'colosseum of dreams' finale. I do enjoy the film's references to Hansel & Gretel, and equating Freddy's power with that of a witch. The explanation for where he got that power has never been given but always fascinates me (Freddy's Dead tried and failed, miserably). I'm not sure exactly what sinks this as a horror film, but I truly recommend it as a good thriller which is meant to be pretty awkward. It's not prime Nightmare on Elm Street, but the series had to end somehow. This is as good a place as any.

'He' killed a large number of locals just to get to his niece, Jamie Lloyd, played by the underrated Danielle Harris. However his doctor, Dr.Loomis, of all people, along with the help of the cops, put an end to the horror by shooting him 'till he was out of sight. But this was only the beginning as Jamie attacked her stepmother as soon as she settled home.Now, it is Halloween night & 'he' has returned to Haddonfield killing randoms in order to murder hid niece. Yet every time he kills, Jamie can sense it which can help Dr Loomis, played by the late Donald Pleasence, to track Myers down.Halloween 5 had potential to spin a twist on the then tired series but the takes the usual, routine direction...what a shame.The plot is weak & tired & old. What's worse is that the movie plays out in the usual routine. What a bummer! So we get a weak storyline, weak direction, weak score, weak script, undeveloped characters...weak movie.Also, the film is heavily clichéd & really predictable. This film isn't even suspenseful, scary, creepy, spooky, eerie, tense, intense or any other adjective that should describe a horror film. Thankfully, i was not expecting much. This picture is pretty much a washed up retread of Halloween 4 The Return of Michael Myres (1988) all over again. Pointless, really. Despite all the above, Halloween 5 was quite entertaining & did a few nice touches. 1st, The Man in Black is introduced in the movie. Good idea. But still, it lead to the stupid thorn subplot... Well there's always the fact that the acting, while not better than the previous installment, is OK. Though Danielle Harris's acting was really good. Ditto Donald Pleasence. Another touch, the atmosphere...wait not the atmosphere (that sucked). The fact that this sequel makes nice attempts to be like or capture the feeling of the original Halloween (1978). You can tell. Michael stalks the girls while they have girl talk, he watches them & when you think he is gonna strike he doesn't. AND remember from number 1 in which the girlfriend thinks Myres is her boyfriend when it's actually Myres dressed up in a costume. Well, that happens in this slasher too, encept it's a bit fractured. Some other things too resemble but i can't remember. All i all i, liked the original Halloween's inspiration towards this flick..yet the original was effective.Really, this flick is kinda like Halloween 4 The Return of Michael Myres (1988) with the style of Halloween (1978). Cool style not played out well enough, though.I almost forgot the gore! This flick has OK gore in it. We get some stabs, some stabs with other sharp weapons. We get blood. But the movie has a slow pace so much of it is tame. Hey, at least it is gorier & more violent than Halloween 4 The Return of Michael Myres (1988). Violence abound. But the death scenes don't stand out much encept for the 2nd one. TAME.I can't recommend it... but if you don't care, go watch it...that is, if you can find it.2 out 5 stars.Followed by the bad sequel, Halloween The Curse of Michael Myres (1994).

However his doctor, Dr.Loomis, of all people, along with the help of the cops, put an end to the horror by shooting him 'till he was out of sight. But this was only the beginning as Jamie attacked her stepmother as soon as she settled home.Now, it is Halloween night & 'he' has returned to Haddonfield killing randoms in order to murder hid niece. Yet every time he kills, Jamie can sense it which can help Dr Loomis, played by the late Donald Pleasence, to track Myers down.Halloween 5 had potential to spin a twist on the then tired series but the takes the usual, routine direction...what a shame.The plot is weak & tired & old. What's worse is that the movie plays out in the usual routine. What a bummer! So we get a weak storyline, weak direction, weak score, weak script, undeveloped characters...weak movie.Also, the film is heavily clichéd & really predictable. This film isn't even suspenseful, scary, creepy, spooky, eerie, tense, intense or any other adjective that should describe a horror film. Thankfully, i was not expecting much. This picture is pretty much a washed up retread of Halloween 4 The Return of Michael Myres (1988) all over again. Pointless, really. Despite all the above, Halloween 5 was quite entertaining & did a few nice touches. 1st, The Man in Black is introduced in the movie. Good idea. But still, it lead to the stupid thorn subplot... Well there's always the fact that the acting, while not better than the previous installment, is OK. Though Danielle Harris's acting was really good. Ditto Donald Pleasence. Another touch, the atmosphere...wait not the atmosphere (that sucked). The fact that this sequel makes nice attempts to be like or capture the feeling of the original Halloween (1978). You can tell. Michael stalks the girls while they have girl talk, he watches them & when you think he is gonna strike he doesn't. AND remember from number 1 in which the girlfriend thinks Myres is her boyfriend when it's actually Myres dressed up in a costume. Well, that happens in this slasher too, encept it's a bit fractured. Some other things too resemble but i can't remember. All i all i, liked the original Halloween's inspiration towards this flick..yet the original was effective.Really, this flick is kinda like Halloween 4 The Return of Michael Myres (1988) with the style of Halloween (1978). Cool style not played out well enough, though.I almost forgot the gore! This flick has OK gore in it. We get some stabs, some stabs with other sharp weapons. We get blood. But the movie has a slow pace so much of it is tame. Hey, at least it is gorier & more violent than Halloween 4 The Return of Michael Myres (1988). Violence abound. But the death scenes don't stand out much encept for the 2nd one. TAME.I can't recommend it... but if you don't care, go watch it...that is, if you can find it.2 out 5 stars.Followed by the bad sequel, Halloween The Curse of Michael Myres (1994).

He also meets an unforgettable character, Ricky Fits, his next door neighbor, son of Colonel Frank Fits, an open and proud homophobic who is tightly closeted himself. These reasons become Lester's ultimate wake up call and he starts living his life as he has always dreamed it, like quitting his job to work in a fast-food restaurant, smoking pot and lifting weights to look good naked.Ricky Fits, who becomes Jane Burnham's boyfriend, sees the world through a different perspective, like a painting of the world, rather than what it naturally represents.Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it, like my heart's going to cave in.

Also, the patriotic speeches that Cuumming says (that were written by Dorothy Parker) have dated badly, and the encounter with circus troupe is poorly done (the beard on the bearded lady is clearly false). However, the last half hour is edge-of-your-seat viewing, the climax atop the Stature of Liberty is very well done, and the film is a clear predecessor of North By Northwest (1959).

The scenes with the murderer trying to kill the guests with moving walls and what have you, were very silly, sometimes at an advantage in comedy, sometimes not.

I would appreciate it, if someone helped me with understanding what was the truth, because all I remember were accusations of false identity, Truman Capote and a strange woman laughing.

Robert Redford is a very very good choice for the role of brubaker. He made a good job in this movie. No need to say something about the story because it already nominated to an academy award, it was really really good. As an addition; seeing middle-aged morgan freeman as a mad prisoner was a good experience. I also liked David keith acting and his character in the movie.Secondly I liked about the movie is giving importance to the details like brubaker's prison management. He shows to every manager; how should be a manager like? He is interested in everything about the prisoners and their problems of course. His attitude against politicians was also interesting to watch.Lastly this was a good movie also a very good prison movie. It is some harsh but it suits this story. If you like prison movies you should watch this one. A good experience to watch and analyze a degenerated system.

Stephen King is credited as one of the writers, and this is surprising to see as it is unclear if he has actually contributed to the script or this film was inspired from King's initial novel. The acting is quite mediocre, but the special effects are of record tackiness, with human puppets of the amazing quality of voodoo dolls. The gore factor is satisfying, even unexpectedly high. The reference to environmental issues as a contemporary premise to any evil we see on screen is flimsy and ephemeral. Overall, spare a few bucks to rent this on a Saturday night in with your friends and pizza.
