However once you start to watch it, you will realise that like some of its characters, it is a movie that is very deceptive and will leave you breathless. With the screenplay based on the story written by star Jet Li himself, this film has moments that no-one could ever comprehend seeing. While Li might be criticised for being &#145;one dimensional' in his movie roles, it has to be said that he is one of the best martial arts actors going around at the present time.Liu, a Chinese intelligence officer, goes to Paris on assignment and becomes embroiled in a deadly conspiracy. When the man he has come to help betrays him, he is forced on the run, accused of a murder he didn't commit. He teams up with Jessica, an American woman forced into prostitution against her will, who wants to escape and seek justice. As Jessica and Liu go up against cunning and ruthless adversaries, Liu makes a promise to Jessica that could compromise his career, even his life.The star of this film is Liu (Jet Li), who is an expert Chinese cop sent to stop an international drug conspiracy. He is traveling to the city of Paris for the first time, making it totally alien to him. Liu carries only a gun and needles which are rapt around his wrist. These are acupuncture needles, which he has the skill to use, to help heal his friends or kill his enemies. The finale action sequence has Liu refer to the title of the film, whereby the use of a needle technique called &#145;Kiss of the Dragon', which is highly illegal, as it must be, which can disrupt the body's blood flow, making all the blood travel to the head and then killing the person as it tries to escape from whatever cavity it can. This scene was astonishing to see being played out.The supporting cast in &#145;Kiss of the dragon' consists of Jessica (beauty Bridget Fonda), a girl who is forced to take drugs and be a prostitute by French Police inspector Richard (Tcheky Karyo). You do not refuse Richard, as the consequences could be fatal. He has many henchmen that are on the lookout for &#145;John' (Liu), as he has the evidence that could destroy Richard. Along the way Jessica meets up with Liu and they help each other out of sticky situations that have arisen. I enjoy the role taken on by Fonda a lot, as her character gives the story its emotion and balance whereby she helps Liu get around Paris.  I like how and where this movie was presented. The director shows off Paris in many ways, such as landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, which is cleverly incorporated through a fighting sequence. The director Chris Nahon was able to do this, via producer and screenwriter Luc Besson's help in getting leading cinematographer Thierry Arbogast, who did some great work. While the story might be simple on the surface, who can complain when there is such great action scenes to compensate.This then leads me into &#145;Kiss of the dragon's' action and stunts which are exhilarating. Li's character has many fighting sequences that you would believe he has no hope of winning. The start of the film makes uncertain of what is going to happen, then in the blink of an eye you are presented with action and stunts that will leave you speechless. The one scene at the start which shows Liu slamming a billiard ball to kill a villain was unbelievable. Then the fighting scenes at the shop, boat, office building and orphanage are full-on, making them intoxicating to the viewers. However one of the final fighting scenes with Liu taking on a whole class of Black belts is hilarious, as you know he is going to win. &#145;Kiss of the Dragon' works, because where the story is lacking, the action and fighting scenes take up the slack. Jet Li has done some good movies, such as `Lethal Weapon 4' and &#145;Romeo Must Die' where he shows off all his martial art skills. If you have not seen him in either of those films, then watch them by all means. Finally, I want to mention that I have had many treatments of acupuncture in 2002 which have helped me immensely.

It's a little better. I thought the acting on behalf of Ewan McGregor was better than in EPI. He seems to take on the role that Alec Guinness left us in Star Wars.I would have loved to see more of Christopher Lee. I think he is such a great actor. He almost steals every scene that he's in with the exception of the fighting sceen with Yoda. This movie would have been much better if they wrote Count Dooku more into the script. He takes the role of a villian very brilliantly as did Darth Vader in the original series. Samual L. Jackson also did a wonderful job for the scenes that he was in. His one liners are great, This party's over! He's begins to take on that Bad Mother F**ker role that he once played in Pulp Fiction. He even told Lucas himself that he doesn't want to go out like a bit**.  It's a shame that Mace Windu will have to die in EPIII.Hayden Christensen does a decent job of acting in this movie. He shows emotion at times but it's just not that believable. I blame part of this on the director. Lucas fails to capture or deliver the emotions that need to be displayed. It's just like Lucas just cuts and pastes this on the film and it's going to work.I believe all the other characters do a decent job with the exception of one person. Either Natilie Portman can't act or there's some bad directing. She isn't believable. She comes across as fake. The writing doesn't help her much. She really doesn't do anything with the putrid lines she's given. I think her and Jake Lloyd are the ones who helped EPI sink. I don't feel any chemistry between the two like Han and Leia. The love sceen doesn't feel believable. I just doesn't work here. It seems like Lucas just put these two together just so they'll have Luke and Leia.As for special effects and sound, I'm not going to go there but I'd just like to add one thing. Great movies are not built on special effects and sound, they're built on great story telling. Any great director could have made a great film out of a low budget.Overall, I miss Han Solo. I'm glad that R2D2 and C-3PO add some humor and nostalgia back to the series. I miss the fights between Han and Leia, the feeling of mentor and student with Luke and Obi-Wan, and the darkness of Darth Vader. I would say this is a mediocre movie that doesn't do much better than it's predecessor. This series doesn't come off as adventuresome as the original trilogy did. The promise is that this series has some great actors. Hopefully they should utilize their talent in the last installment and lay down a little on the special effects.

Some of them have achieved more compelling action, some spiffy CGI effects, but none of them can match the grandeur of this film's vision or its colorful gallery of characters.The film's action stylings and detective story plot are mostly a cover for the issues it broods over  what is it that makes us human?  How indeed do I know that I am human?The answers concern a complex meditation on memory, something that previous to Blade Runner had been the strict domain of filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman.  BR took sci-fi film and pushed it into adult territory, just when the Star Wars revolution was threatening to turn the tide forever in favor of space opera.  Blade Runner brought us back to the days of the German silents (Metropolis, Aelita) in which a dark, uncertain future was coupled with doubts about the worth or meaning of human existence.There is a lot to look at here, with beautiful photography, and inspired direction and a batch of memorable performances from the excellent supporting cast.  Hauer steals the movie from the seemingly disinterested Ford, particularly in the film's stunning finale.This movie is also notable for the depth of detail that was put into its futuristic vision.  Everything enforces the notion that this is an Earth we would not want to live in, and somewhat oblique dialogue occasionally hints that (as Dick's novel makes clear) Deckard would in fact not be on Earth if he was healthy enough to leave.

Some of them have achieved more compelling action, some spiffy CGI effects, but none of them can match the grandeur of this film's vision or its colorful gallery of characters.The film's action stylings and detective story plot are mostly a cover for the issues it broods over  what is it that makes us human?  How indeed do I know that I am human?The answers concern a complex meditation on memory, something that previous to Blade Runner had been the strict domain of filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman.  BR took sci-fi film and pushed it into adult territory, just when the Star Wars revolution was threatening to turn the tide forever in favor of space opera.  Blade Runner brought us back to the days of the German silents (Metropolis, Aelita) in which a dark, uncertain future was coupled with doubts about the worth or meaning of human existence.There is a lot to look at here, with beautiful photography, and inspired direction and a batch of memorable performances from the excellent supporting cast.  Hauer steals the movie from the seemingly disinterested Ford, particularly in the film's stunning finale.This movie is also notable for the depth of detail that was put into its futuristic vision.  Everything enforces the notion that this is an Earth we would not want to live in, and somewhat oblique dialogue occasionally hints that (as Dick's novel makes clear) Deckard would in fact not be on Earth if he was healthy enough to leave.

It was a lot of fun to watch this movie with my girlfriend and take turns picking at each other over the different issues.  I have not yet seen My Big Greek Wedding, which I understand is based a lot on some similar themes, but I can say if you know anything about Latino culture, you will probably enjoy this movie.  It isn't the funniest movie I've ever seen...but then again, I rarely find romantic comedies to have any decent humor in them anyway. If you and your woman want to rent something sometime and she won't be a good sport and let you rent Commando or something from Monty Python, but you can't deal with Ever After, this would make a good choice for a compromise.
