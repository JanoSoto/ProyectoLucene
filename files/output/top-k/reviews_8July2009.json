[{"date":"8 July 2009","score":"0 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Honestly this is why Hollywood is in decline. How this movie got green lit is beyond me. Firstly let me start with the plot. It is at best cringe worthy. But this is Hollywood so I guess suspension of disbelief is in order. Further the acting is what makes this movie a real stinker. Really you cant expect much from Brendan. He is pretty much the simple over the hill actor whom at best can capture the camera in some scenes. However Alica is just terrible (as always). Looks aside this girl ruined the movie with her catty talk and worst of all cringe worthy tone. She has no talent aside from looks which is why her career has plummeted. Aside from that the rest of the actors are forgettable at best. Do yourself a favor and skip this stinker. Watch Back to the Future instead or something like that. Or like all of us who have seen this movie you will wish you could blast yourself to the past to erase this movie!
