And as a kid, I liked it much better than O&C because I understood the story in this one but not the other as much.Now that I'm older, I decided to watch both films when I learned that this was more successful. I was expecting to feel the same way. But boy did I change my mind. I loved Oliver and Company, it was a real delight to watch again and I'm disappointed that it's become so underrated. But The Land Before Time? Oh boy. I can understand why I liked it as a little kid. It's very easy to follow. But now, as an adult, it's too dumbed down. At times it felt like it was trying too hard to be a dramatic and grown-up story but fell flat.Let me try to explain. The baby dinosaurs hatch at the beginning and look so cute. I was reminded of the opening of Dumbo when Littlefoot's parents were gushing all over him. Only, in Dumbo they give you time to really see the bond between mother and son. In LBT, I thought they didn't give it any time at all. I never saw any affection between the two, just a bunch of really boring conversations. So when the mother died, I felt nothing. I honestly didn't care. Even the death scene was boring. And then Littlefoot meets up with a jerk, Cera, who reminded me of a boring version of Lucy from the Peanuts comic strip. Only she's not nearly as much fun as Lucy. We also meet Ducky, who's okay but not really all that memorable. And Petrie, who is REALLY annoying (when he almost died at the end, I was hoping he wouldn't come back). And finally Spike, who serves no purpose in the entire story except maybe to look cute. They all go through this land and get into adventures and finally find what they're looking for. Yep. That's about it. No depth, no character development (except for Cera perhaps but it seems abrupt), and nothing interesting whatsoever. The music is also repetitive and the end even shows clips from the beginning as if to remind you that you're supposed to feel something. I found this bland and boring.So I think the only reason it's hyped is because it's better than the sequels (but that's not hard to do) and because a lot of people grew up watching it. And while it does have some nice animation, there's nothing going for it. I've heard it compared to Disney but, like I said, I really liked Disney's offering that year. This is just as bland and uninteresting as An American Tail. Typical Bluth, cute but no depth whatsoever.If you're under age 6 or 7, you might like this though. It's easy to follow and the characters are easy on the eyes and mind. But this advice is for little kids. If you're a teenager or an adult, I suggest skipping this one and taking a look at Oliver and Company. You might surprise yourself.

They sport names like Bullet-Tooth, Turkish and Brick Top, and seem to value all human life aside from their own lightly.After a series of coincidences and unfortunate timing Turkish (Jason Statham) finds himself involved in finding a suitable replacement for an injured fighter for shonky promoter Brick Top's next event.Brick Top is a legitimately hard b*stard, scared of no-one and capable of anything, he is blunt, brutal and vicious.

Ritchie might benefit from picking a group of characters from Snatch and Lock, Stock, then just making film after film with them all interacting. He could introduce new characters and subplots along the way, and could save himself from making increasingly samey films with basically the same characters, just with different names.Lock Stock was great, Snatch very good, but everything he has done since is average at best and often a lot worse.Snatch works because at the time Ritchie had yet to exhaust what a group of nefarious underworld characters could get up to while swearing frequently and killing each other.

Zorg is concerned that if good succeeds in wiping out evil his business might suffer, (which makes sense if you think about it).The action moves to a Hawaii themed holiday ship in deep space, where a handover of special stones representing the other 4 elements is due to take place.Everyone wants to get their hands on the stones and Leeloo, and Dallas is stuck in the middle of it all.All the while Leeloo &#x96; who was only born hours previously when regenerated from damaged tissue &#x96; is learning at an incredible rate about humanity and what she has inadvertently got herself into.Everyone jostles for position and plans their attacks before the finale turns into a Bruce Willis special bullet-space-opera &#x96; only with odd looking monsters instead of terrorists of cowboys.Every movie nowadays is marketed either as Nothing you've ever seen before or Exactly like almost everything you've seen before. Generally only the latter is accurate, only in most cases it should say the same&#x85; only worse.So while The Fifth Element is indeed just another sci-fi flick with big names and shootouts on alien worlds, it is perhaps the most original looking big budget film for a long while.The future New York (I think) looks especially cool, as we all expect traffic in the future is airborne and cruises around on multiple levels. Space is at a premium and the layout of Dallas' apartment is especially well appointed and designed.In fact we are not merely told things are futuristic we are shown, everything on screen looks similar but quite different to the versions currently available, the fashion is pretty insane but oddly practical and the backdrops and sets bright and colourful.Aside from the headline names the cast is filled with non-actors, models and pretty people mainly, and weed-loving musical headcase Tricky has a small role as Zorg's main henchman.Chris Tucker steals the second half of the film as chipmunk voiced radio DJ Ruby Rhod, a hyperactive, superficial vacuous motormouth who rocks ridiculous outfits and hairstyles and will not shut up from the moment his show starts to well after it ends. He is followed by toadying Yes-Men and for some reason is universally adored.None of this should work, and even if some did there is no way it should result in a great film &#x96; everything is just too different, too off-kilter, too Non-Hollywood to be successful.This film is more out there and ambitious than any big budget film I can remember, but somehow it all works.The first half is merely eye catching and amusing and basically ends with one and all arriving on the space resort ship.The second half starts with the introduction of Ruby and builds gradually until a concert performance by a giant blue alien creature. Now the performance is opera but don't let that fool you it's actually quite cool and really effective, and allows pause for breath before Dallas goes bang-bang, leading to an effective final 20 minutes as things start moving even more rapidly and the huge ball of evil looms ever closer.The Fifth Element doesn't get the credit that it deserves today, I'm not sure why but can only assume that it is viewed as a non-American made kiddie space film. And while Luc Besson, Bruce Willis and co don't take anything too seriously here The Fifth Element is an enormously entertaining, amazingly eye-catching and truly original flick that holds up even 15 odd years since it's release.Final Rating &#x96; 9 \/ 10. Jovovich is good, Oldman suitably hammy and Willis wink-winks it up, but the triumph of The Fifth Element is the audacity of the visuals and effectiveness of the set pieces. This is a movie unlike anything you've seen, for once that isn't a bad thing.

It's easily in my all time top 20 films I've ever seen, and it gets everything right. It has a dream cast and a level of intelligence that's unheard of in movies these days. Need lots of action and cheap thrills? You'll most certainly hate it. Do you enjoy high quality dialogue in your movies? Then it's like porn. Better than porn actually, seeing how you can watch Glengarry Glen Ross over and over and it will always be just as great.This awkwardly titled classic comes from a play by David Mamet, who also wrote the script. It's a dark, profane, bitter, and cynical story about an office full of sleazy, lowlife salesmen (Pacino, Lemmon, Harris, and Arkin) who's job is to get in contact with cold potential customers (leads), and pass off what's essentially uninhabitable swampland as prime real estate. The job is naturally an exercise in futility, as most of the men are performing very below average, despite their most desperate efforts. The fact that the good leads are being held back by their boss (Spacey) until management sees some results isn't helping either. The situation is a humiliating paradox, that becomes outright desperate when a manager (Alec Baldwin) comes to the office from headquarters and announces a motivational sales contest that will mean prizes for the winners and unemployment for everyone else.The characters are developed to perfection, and it is their words and reactions to the situation at hand that make this film such a work of genius. Ricky Roma (Al Pacino), has nothing to worry about. He's pretty much always been the top salesman at the office, treating his sales more like tangent-laced seductions, one of which we see working effortlessly. Unfortunately for everyone else, Roma's guaranteed victory narrows down the potential winners. The other guys have varying, but equally desperate reactions to this.Shelley Levine (Jack Lemmon) is the oldest of the salesmen, and while he was once Roma's equal, he has been seriously slipping in his age and hasn't closed a sale in a very long time. He's in a desperate family situation, which is unspecified, but clearly severe enough that he can't afford to lose his job. He starts by trying to bribe their boss, Williamson (Kevin Spacey), and when that doesn't work, he tries to worm his way into the home of a family who are just as set on buying nothing as he is on selling anything. It's painful to watch, even though the character is unlikeable in many ways.And then there's Dave Moss (Ed Harris) and George Aaronow (Alan Arkin). These guys have never been near the top, and now their expendability is here to haunt them. George spends the night listening passively as Moss pontificates on everything wrong with their office, which may or may not turn out to be justifying a robbery. Because the next morning, the office is found burglarized. And although Moss was the only one to verbalize his desire to do so, everyone has a reason to. The morning after the robbery, these situations all come to a head and the men are all exposed for the backstabbing scumbags they really are, particularly when Roma's customer from the night before shows up intent on canceling the sale.The dialogue sizzles. It is some of the best dialogue Mamet ever wrote, which is saying a lot. Every actor sinks into their role, and it's hard to single out a stand-out performance aside from Alec Baldwin's ten minute appearance delivering an unforgettably cruel and venomous speech. Jack Lemmon, most well-known from classic movies like The Apartment and Some Like it Hot, is hard to forget in this movie with a character who is incredibly unlikable, yet still sympathetic. Everyone plays a shade of unlikable in this film, but as far as characters you'll love to hate goes, Kevin Spacey's Williamson takes the cake. He has the easiest job in the office, and he treats his employees like his position makes him more important to the company. He is a complete tool in every way, and when he screws over Roma, you can bet that Al Pacino will dish out the verbal assault to end all verbal assaults (Who told you that you could work with MEN?!). It's a completely satisfying moment, as memorable as any of Pacino's best moments from The Godfather, and it's all the better since you totally feel that Spacey's character deserves it.I could gush over this movie scene after scene all day. It's not so much a movie that appeals to me on a personal level as it is one that plays like a great piece of music. The dialogue is as pleasurable to the ears as great music, and the movie has a stagy yet lyrical quality that sucks you in and doesn't let go. It's one of the most fast-paced films you'll ever see, with two very distinct acts. The movie is over before you know it. Even if it bores you to tears, it'll be over before you realized you were bored. Overall, give the movie a chance. It's the best compilation of writing and acting since 1976's Network.

He's pretty much always been the top salesman at the office, treating his sales more like tangent-laced seductions, one of which we see working effortlessly. Unfortunately for everyone else, Roma's guaranteed victory narrows down the potential winners. The other guys have varying, but equally desperate reactions to this.Shelley Levine (Jack Lemmon) is the oldest of the salesmen, and while he was once Roma's equal, he has been seriously slipping in his age and hasn't closed a sale in a very long time. He's in a desperate family situation, which is unspecified, but clearly severe enough that he can't afford to lose his job. He starts by trying to bribe their boss, Williamson (Kevin Spacey), and when that doesn't work, he tries to worm his way into the home of a family who are just as set on buying nothing as he is on selling anything. It's painful to watch, even though the character is unlikeable in many ways.And then there's Dave Moss (Ed Harris) and George Aaronow (Alan Arkin). These guys have never been near the top, and now their expendability is here to haunt them. George spends the night listening passively as Moss pontificates on everything wrong with their office, which may or may not turn out to be justifying a robbery. Because the next morning, the office is found burglarized. And although Moss was the only one to verbalize his desire to do so, everyone has a reason to. The morning after the robbery, these situations all come to a head and the men are all exposed for the backstabbing scumbags they really are, particularly when Roma's customer from the night before shows up intent on canceling the sale.The dialogue sizzles. It is some of the best dialogue Mamet ever wrote, which is saying a lot. Every actor sinks into their role, and it's hard to single out a stand-out performance aside from Alec Baldwin's ten minute appearance delivering an unforgettably cruel and venomous speech. Jack Lemmon, most well-known from classic movies like The Apartment and Some Like it Hot, is hard to forget in this movie with a character who is incredibly unlikable, yet still sympathetic. Everyone plays a shade of unlikable in this film, but as far as characters you'll love to hate goes, Kevin Spacey's Williamson takes the cake. He has the easiest job in the office, and he treats his employees like his position makes him more important to the company. He is a complete tool in every way, and when he screws over Roma, you can bet that Al Pacino will dish out the verbal assault to end all verbal assaults (Who told you that you could work with MEN?!). It's a completely satisfying moment, as memorable as any of Pacino's best moments from The Godfather, and it's all the better since you totally feel that Spacey's character deserves it.I could gush over this movie scene after scene all day. It's not so much a movie that appeals to me on a personal level as it is one that plays like a great piece of music. The dialogue is as pleasurable to the ears as great music, and the movie has a stagy yet lyrical quality that sucks you in and doesn't let go. It's one of the most fast-paced films you'll ever see, with two very distinct acts. The movie is over before you know it. Even if it bores you to tears, it'll be over before you realized you were bored. Overall, give the movie a chance. It's the best compilation of writing and acting since 1976's Network.

The entire family &#x96; especially Dad &#x96; is pushed around by a local moron named Biff who has tortured him since school age.To blow off steam McFly has a friendship with a local eccentric scientist named Dr Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Doc's dabbles in everything scientific and has hundreds of wonderful inventions, none of which have set the world on fire.But all of that is about to change.Doc's latest creation is a time traveling car (a DeLoreon to be specific) that when gunned to 88mph can FF or rewind to any pre-programmed point in history. McFly is dubious but he agrees at the insistence of Doc Brown to show up at an early morning (actually late evening) trial run in a supermarket car park.Using Doc's dog Einstein as the test pilot they give the car a try, and lo and behold the thing actually works! But before they even have a chance to high five and discuss how this new invention will benefit the world Libyan terrorists unexpectedly show up and gun down the Doc, with McFly only just managing to escape in the DeLorean.This one act sets in chain a series of incredible and intricately plotted events that span 3 centuries and several generations of McFly's (and 'Biff's' for that matter&#x85;) Marty initially is transported back to 1985 where he is hopelessly out of place. While there he manages to meet his two parents before they even have a chance to get together, his actions inadvertently prevent this from happening, meaning that he must somehow play matchmaker to his own folks else he remove himself from existence altogether.There's a whole lot more to the original BttF, aside from literally justifying his own existence Marty manages to invent skateboarding and rock 'n' roll in his limited stay in 1955, all the while striving to avoid actions that somehow alter the future along the way.I obviously can't go into too much detail but the ending was excellent as well.Now some 25 years later time travel in films is commonplace &#x96; even Red Dwarf and Futurama have produced excellent episodes dealing with time travel paradoxes &#x96; and yes I know about The Time Machine and the 'classic' older films dealing with the topic (that I can't name). Back to the Future managed to take a science fiction core and make it interesting to the everyday movie watcher who just wants to be entertained for a couple hours (I am trying to say 'non-geeks'), the original BttF was\/and is immensely original and creative, with solid performances plural by Michael J Fox as, well&#x85; many McFly's.It isn't laugh a minute or gasp inducing but you'll go a long while before you find a mainstream film this innovative and enjoyable, and the sequel was even better! Final Rating &#x96; 8.5 \/ 10. Somehow I admire the 2nd film more, but without the elaborate set-ups structured in this film that wouldn't be near as effective, and this film is effortlessly entertaining in any case.

To summon the undead Candyman is simple, gaze into a mirror and repeat his name 5 times and he will appear instantly to&#x85; well gut you like a fish if the movie is right, (why you would want this I'm not sure).The specifics of this seem to change a little depending on circumstances - In one scene two people split the Candyman duties, splitting the 5 repeats between them&#x85; he appears anyway. This would lead me to believe that every time you say Candyman to a mirror is a little like Russian roulette &#x96; as 4 other people could have said it once each elsewhere.- Further to this if you try to be clever and say it 4 times before chickening out depending on the count he could appear at any point in your sequence.- In some scenes Candy appears instantaneously, in others he seems to take a raincheck and pops up later. I guess there are either many people calling on him or the man is just busy doing other things&#x85; Which could mean this is a chore to old Sweetums, and being summoned is like a doorbell; AGAIN, I just finished killing two teens in Miami! Won't you guys give me 5 minutes to clean my hook?  Speculation and wonderment aside the mythology has become folklore in the local area where Helen and Bernadette are writing a paper on *DRUM ROLL Please!* Urban legends.This takes them to Cabrini Green, an urban ghetto area where word has it Candyman resides, after some faked contacts Helen writes off the legend as a fake.Not so fast Helen&#x85; As people near and dear to Helen start dropping like flies in various bloody dismembered puddles, leaving her on the scene the investigators assume she had something to do with things and question her. Each subsequent step seems to implicate even more, and as she protests her innocence still more Candyman contacts and twists ensure she remains a suspect, and the police and her husband start to wonder if she might just be 110% nuts.There is some good simple music in Candyman which lends a bit of class to proceedings, including an effective piano loop that is instantly familiar when you hear it, some gore that may have been extreme in the 90s but hardly raises an eyebrow today, and it is always interesting to watch a period piece where almost everyone smokes and telephones still have cords.This year Natalie Portman put in a gonzo performance as the crizzazy Nena in Black Swan and was lauded for it.

","genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"27 December 2011","score":"","review":" Without going into too much detail, Kickboxer follows the same formula as Rocky IV and, to a lesser extent, the other Rocky pictures and the Karate Kid films. Yet I found this film to be a lot of fun despite its predictability. Jean Claude Van Damme (playing the hero Kurt Sloan) is not a great actor, but his youthful exuberance, cheerful demeanour, and dashing appearance make him a very likable hero nonetheless. In addition, Van Damme is also not held back as much as in his later films when he goes through the indignity of saying fewer lines than the supporting cast. For me, the decision not to hold Van Damme back is a good one, because a hero can never hold our interest unless he has a well defined character to go along with his martial arts moves. Yet the best character in Kickboxer has to be Xian Chow (Dennis Chan) who trains Van Damme for his big fight with Tong Po (Michel Qissi). Xian Chow was obviously modelled after Mr. Miyagi from the Karate Kid movies, but his character has a few fresh elements. To begin with, Dennis Chan projects a dry sense of humour, like when he explains to Kurt Sloan why it is unwise to train a stranger in the art of Muay Thai. This movie was sold on its martial arts sequences, but the truth of the matter is that Dennis Chan steals the show whenever he performs on screen.The rest of Kickboxer consists of Van Damme's Kurt Sloan going through intensive training against a gorgeous backdrop of Thai architecture and great 1980s music, which is just as well since training sequences in an exotic martial arts form and amidst Ancient Thai architecture are reliably entertaining. This film, especially its training sequences, also has a subtle statement to make on life which was very much in keeping with the spirit of the 1980s. This statement, simply expressed, is that the route to success and lasting happiness is to suppress troubling emotions, pull yourself up by your bootstraps, and work incredibly hard to overcome adversity. Those people who fail to overcome adversity in this way only have themselves to blame.
