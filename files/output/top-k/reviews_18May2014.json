Studio interference aside, the film doesn't look like it had production trouble - it's dark humor is intact and it's overflowing with gore.

The cheesy music, the clothes, the dreams, its all 80s. Dream Warriors is definitely in the top 3 Elm street films, alongside New Nightmare and the original. It sends off the old cast while bringing in new ones and strikes a perfect balance between the eerie creepiness of the first and the over the top comedy of the latter films.Kristen is our new hero who is being haunted by Freddy. She is put in a mental hospital after she refuses to sleep and is looked after by Larry Fishburne from The Matrix. She is joined by a cast off really troubled but really great and interesting teens who all go on to be... Dream Warriors! with the help of Nancy and Donald Thompson.The film is a joy to look at, the effects, the different ways they accomplished everything is really interesting. The different dream sequences are above anything else in the original, not better necessarily, but definitely more effects heavy. Freddy as clay animation, The puppet master dream where veins are used as strings, its all very creative and very enjoyable.The cast is all really strong here, you can tell they truly care about the film their making, especially Heather Langenkamp and John Saxon who arguably had their best roles in the original Nightmare. Its a slasher where the characters actually get to fight back in their own way and the ending is sure to tug a few heart strings.Freddy has some of his best lines here, he's still cunning, he's still creepy but by god he is hilarious at points. 'Welcome To Primetime, Bitch' has to be one of the best improvised lines in film history.Overall, problems are few and far between here, I love it for different reasons than the Original and New Nightmare but it is a damn good movie and maybe the most entertaining of the original Nightmare movies.

It's got a look to it that the late Tony Scott would approve of. It's also sprinkled with some Jerry Bruckheimer star dust (these two weren't involved with the making of the film but their influence is there). So OK, let's not beat around the bush, this movie is so campy that you might have to build a fire and make some s'mores just to view it. It's got a little bit of everything for all types of movie patrons. A sort of dumbed down Matrix (1999) (I'm telling you, this is not an insult), there is plenty of action highlighted by slow mo explosions, Halle Berry showing off a little skin, Hugh Jackman playing a computer hacker (for all the technology lovers out there), John Travolta hamming it up as Gabriel, the ultimate terrorist jokester and Don Cheadle (always reliable) playing a flamboyant FBI agent. In retrospect, Swordfish is such a fast paced movie that the filmmakers don't want you to figure out how silly it is, they just want you to be entertained. Toward its over the top conclusion, Swordfish almost comes literally to a screeching halt. It kind of pulls the rug from underneath you. In truth, I love surprise endings and it's strange because up until the last ten minutes, I never thought this flick was the type of picture that would have that characteristic. I'm glad I was mistaken. To set the record straight, I go to the movies for two reasons, to escape from reality and be entertained. Swordfish, by hook or by crook, accomplished both.The story begins with Hugh Jackman's character (computer expert Stanley Jobson) being tapped for an illegal assignment by a renegade terrorist (Gabriel Shear, played with chilling banter by John notice my goatee Travolta). Jobson is considered one of the greatest hackers in the world and Shear wants him to hack into a government slush fund to steal possibly 9.5 billion dollars. Jackman's character is gonna pocket a huge cut from this job, so why not. He's trying to get custody of his loving daughter. And basically, he really needs the money to get a darn good lawyer. But hold up, Jobson is also being followed by L.A.'s finest because he's not suppose to be in California. He already went to prison for his criminal computer deeds a few years ago. This, among other saturated plot elements, sets the film running. Jackman's character is pulled in different directions and it's hard for him to concentrate on the task at hand. It certainly doesn't help when Halle Berry (undercover agent Ginger Knowles) distracts him to the point where he doesn't know who to trust.In its short running time (hour and a half plus change), Swordfish starts to reveal more and more plot twists, until the story just plain hits you over the head. The sense of urgency and immediacy that accompanies this film is downright scary. Some critics have called this movie silly and ludicrous (among other things), I say everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I liked it by cracky! I embraced the film even more as things got darker, especially with Travolta's character's motives. He actually says, I'm a murderer oh and much worse. Throughout the film, he delivers a lot of speeches and chews more scenery than a rottweiler with a 72 ounce steak bone. The best part is that you think you know him, but the layers just keep coming (hint hint). Jackman, playing it a little more serious, gives Swordfish a heavy dramatic center. In this type of giddy, goofy movie in which stuff is blows up, it's not entirely needed, but I don't fault his efforts. This film and the X-Men movies kind of put him on the map.As with a lot of three star vehicles (including this one), their are a couple of oversights here and there. One of them might just be the screenplay by Skip Woods (screenwriter, A Good Day To Die Hard (2013)). Yeah, it's got a lot of juicy one liners that the actors can play with, but it lacks a more potent element. That would be attention to detail. Then you have the under utilization of actor Don Cheadle (agent J.T. Roberts). His character is fairly well established in the first and second act, but he gets put on the back burner toward the last 30-40 minutes. By the end, you pretty much forget that he's even in the movie.All and all, Swordfish is part bad boy cyber fantasy, part thriller, and part political drama. After viewing it, I attained this thought. Sometimes a film is so bad it's good. This one is so bad it's brilliant. It winks at the audience hoping that someone will wink back. It painstakingly begs you to like it. Don't worry guys, you've got a friend in me. ","genre":null},{"date":"18 May 2014","score":"","review":" What can you say about Swordfish.

It is an awful example of 'the spies next door' genre, which Hitchcock pioneered more than half a century ago. In order to explain how bad it is I have to give a few spoilers. But it is so bad I have no fear that spoilers would ruin anybody's fun. This movie isn't fun on any level. A middle class husband Michael (Bridges) and wife who live in a neat upscale neighborhood are befriended by a seemingly normal family from across the street. But they're not any normal family, they are right-wing militia cultists who have planned a starring role for for the unsuspecting and mentally unbalanced Michael. He is going to be the fall guy when they blow up the FBI building in Washington D.C. They also intend to take his children and turn them into little anti-government cultists as well. This movie was made before 911 and the Oklahoma City bombing was still on people's minds. At the time it was possible to imagine that there were other anti-government fanatics out there who might want to do further damage for their cause. As is usual for the genre we're given a shadowy secret organization which appears to have unlimited resources and omniscience. The plot is fanciful and preposterous. Only if Michael plays his part perfectly per the terrorist's script can the plot succeed. Bridges plays Michael as an overwrought nincompoop who falls for every trick and bait the bad guys plan for him. He is, in other words, the perfect patsy. Raymond Chandler was once asked to write a script for Strangers on a Train and he observed later that writing Strangers was very hard because the plot was absurd you had to work very hard to make the audience believe it. Hitchcock could make his audiences believe in some pretty absurd things, in part because Hitchcock never lost his sense of humor. You always had the sense in his movies that all this intrigue and cloak and dagger was a great bit of fun, playing on the viewers paranoia, but not to be taken seriously. With Hitchcock the good guy always wins through luck and pluck and the paranoia is dispersed in the end. But in Arlington Road the paranoia is played as if it's real. When the bad guys win in the end you wonder if the filmmakers are taking it all too seriously. Did they really want people to believe that there are militia cults out there pretending to be average citizens so they can blow up buildings and indoctrinate their neighbor's children? Bridges plays Michael as a jerk with anger control issues so we don't care about him, he is not our hero against the forces of darkness but a shill who seems to get what he deserves when he's arrested for a crime he didn't commit. There are huge holes in the plot and the cult family is one-dimensional, almost as if they were alien robots. It is impossible to imagine real people behaving the way people behave in this disaster of a film. The movie may make some susceptible people feel paranoid of their neighbors, but in the category of entertainment it's a total flop. After 9\/11 we realize that we have far more to fear from Muslim extremists than from home grown militias. The militias were a useful straw man when AR was made, but are unbelievable today.

Raymond Chandler was once asked to write a script for Strangers on a Train and he observed later that writing Strangers was very hard because the plot was absurd you had to work very hard to make the audience believe it. Hitchcock could make his audiences believe in some pretty absurd things, in part because Hitchcock never lost his sense of humor. You always had the sense in his movies that all this intrigue and cloak and dagger was a great bit of fun, playing on the viewers paranoia, but not to be taken seriously. With Hitchcock the good guy always wins through luck and pluck and the paranoia is dispersed in the end. But in Arlington Road the paranoia is played as if it's real. When the bad guys win in the end you wonder if the filmmakers are taking it all too seriously. Did they really want people to believe that there are militia cults out there pretending to be average citizens so they can blow up buildings and indoctrinate their neighbor's children? Bridges plays Michael as a jerk with anger control issues so we don't care about him, he is not our hero against the forces of darkness but a shill who seems to get what he deserves when he's arrested for a crime he didn't commit. There are huge holes in the plot and the cult family is one-dimensional, almost as if they were alien robots. It is impossible to imagine real people behaving the way people behave in this disaster of a film. The movie may make some susceptible people feel paranoid of their neighbors, but in the category of entertainment it's a total flop. After 9\/11 we realize that we have far more to fear from Muslim extremists than from home grown militias. The militias were a useful straw man when AR was made, but are unbelievable today. But even if the bad guys were halfway believable this is a very, very bad movie. Run away!

The movie is a fictionalized account of his life, although many of the events are true if not accurate in detail. For a tale about this Scottish Robin Hood though, this script led me to question some of the decisions made by Rob. That may be as intended by the writers and\/or director. For all the different roles and fine actors in this film, Rob Roy comes down to two characters who epitomize the age-old struggle of good versus evil. The acting is very good all around, especially by Tim Roth who plays Archibald Cunningham, one of the most despicable characters most viewers would ever care to see. Roth received an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe nomination as best supporting actor. He did win the BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) award for best supporting actor role. Like most other viewers I suspect, I enjoyed seeing justice done at the end for Cunningham. The characters of Archibald Cunningham and Rob Roy (played by Liam Neeson) are exact opposites in this movie. Archie is a wastrel; Rob a responsible worker and husband. Archie is a misogynist who abuses women for sex. Rob respects women, and treats them so. Archie is a hedonist; Rob is a responsible father, husband and livestock manager. Archie is a self-centered loner who manipulates and treats people with disdain; Rob is a caring friend who gives to those in need. Archie is a liar, thief and bully. Rob is honest, honorable and kind. Two lines from this film, one by each of the two male antagonists, describe their different characters very well. Betty, a discharged housemaid who has become pregnant by Cunningham, confronts him and asks, What are we to do? I love you, Archie. Cunningham replies, Love is a dung hill, Betty, and I am but a cock that climbs upon it to crow. In a scene with his wife, Mary (played by Jessica Lange), Rob says, Honor is a gift a man gives himself. And no one can take it away.One incident in the film is quite incongruous. That's after Cunningham kills McDonald (played by Eric Stoltz) in the woods and robs him. A following scene shows him in a boat on the bay dumping a body into the brink. Cunningham is a very slight build of a man. How in the world he could carry off a much more stout man by himself &#x96; for whatever distance, is quite unexplainable. Even then, where did he find or have a boat stashed away to take out in the bay to dispose of a body? One of the best things about this film is its glorious color cinematography of Scotland. The scenery of the rugged but picturesque highland country is quite inspiring. And, the film gives us a glimpse of what life probably was like in that time and place. The other technical aspects of the film were all very good. However, this is not a film for the whole family. When I first went to see this film in the theater, the thought was in the back of my mind about a cocktail called a Rob Roy. I had drunk such a drink in the past &#x96; many years ago, and had made it for others when tending bar. A New York bartender invented the drink in 1894 at the Waldorf Hotel &#x96; but I don't know if I ever heard his name. The ingredients call for 1½ oz. of Scotch, ¼ oz. of sweet vermouth, and a dash of angostura bitters. It should be shaken with ice to chill, and then strained into a tall martini or cocktail glass and served with a maraschino cherry. I don't know what inspired the inventor to make such a drink or to name it after Rob Roy. But, since it's a drink with Scotch, it seems obvious that he had our folk hero in mind.

Then 7 years later in Toronto, student Lesra (Vicellous Reon Shannon) finds his biography in a pile of used books. He's a poor student from Brooklyn who is given a chance to study in Canada. With the biography, he starts a long journey to get Carter's release and his good name back with the help of his mentors Lisa (Deborah Kara Unger), Sam (Liev Schreiber) and Terry (John Hannah).It's a very standard biopic from Norman Jewison. Carter's story is never in doubt. Most people would know the ending to the movie. So the tension is not that high. The investigation isn't that exciting. It's no John Grisham novel. However there is a compelling story, and a very compelling performance from Denzel Washington. He is exceptional in this as in many of his performances. There is also a nice side story of a young man who finds purpose in life.

The Empire Strikes back 30 minute version that Garry Hixon put in his files after Innerspace, is really really a masterpiece. Unfortun- ately Disney would not allow it to actually be released. I only get about 30 hits a day on my 4 videos and im sorry to say, don't have the money to release too many more, but there's always hope. I really enjoyed the exp- erience in 1980, but I was a dumb kid, stoned on marijuana and acid. The computer graphics were very avante-garde at the time. Its definitely a love story compared to my version, but is is very long, and very boring. There version of THE FORCE is levitation, which is not the force. The force is feeling it, feeling it, and not using the ability too often, then levitation is possible. Thank you Disney, love Cinderella.
