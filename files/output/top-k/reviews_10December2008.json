The first hour of the movie is pure old fashioned fun, and it doesn't take itself too seriously. Yet when you enter the last half of the film, it takes a dramatic turn for the better. A lot of people bashed this film, and even though for the most part it was a box office flop, I believe it to be one of the best romance films I've ever seen.This was the role that Williams was born to play. Before this he was mostly cast in overly clichéd comedies with flawed scripts. He was known for being one of the funniest men in the industry, but he really shows his true colors in this film. While being generally comedic he makes sure that he keeps his character light-hearted and optimistic. He is a robot who wishes to be human, and will never rest until his goal is completed. The defining moments of the movie are not in its comedy, but in its drama and the social conflict Andrew (Williams) faces with trying to change. The final scene of this movie will have tears flowing and the tissues flying. Every time I watch this film, the ending always gets me, its more powerful than Titanic or King Kong, Capote or Gone With The Wind.Supporting Williams in this brilliant film are Sir Richard Martin (Sam Neil), his caring master and provider. Sam Neil notices the extraordinary originality and difference in Andrew from other robots and uses this to teach Andrew of the ways of man. A career high for Sam Neil, he portrays a character both enlightened and later distraught by Andrew. Little Miss Amanda Martin (Embeth Davidtz) is the daughter of Sir Martin who soon befriends and becomes very attached to Andrew. Andrew and Little Miss form a bond that is lovable and innocent. Embeth Davidtz later portrays Portia Charney, the grand-daughter of Little Miss, whom Williams has a hard time dealing with. Oliver Platt performs as Rupert Burns, an intelligent yet underestimated engineer of robots who helps Andrew on his journey to change. His comedic excellence truly lifts this movie and like I said before, makes sure it doesn't take itself too seriously. The other performances in this film support it greatly, whether it is comedic and dramatic.Altogether, I find this to be one fantastic film. I cannot understand now how this movie was so overlooked and bashed by the public and critics alike. I found it to be a gem and one truly heartbreaking yet uplifting movie that brings hope in believing that this world can make the right decisions. Yet it also brings very sad feelings knowing that it can take so long to be acknowledged for what and who one is. The ending of this movie will leave you breathless and simply taken aback. Trust me, forget all of the things you've heard about this film and give it another shot with an open mind and an open heart. This movie deserves to be noticed among some of the greats, as it is a beautiful portrait of life outside human existence, and how one man can change the way the entire world views one thing. I hope this review was helpful, and In the words of the great Andrew Martin, one is glad to be of service.

Personally, I'm completely against the idea of praising something that you don't actually like, so I respect anyone who thinks that this movie is overrated or even plain awful. My summary is only an opinion, but by no means I intend to make people change their mind or disapprove their concept of this film.'Suspiria' is one of the many Italian horror films that came out during the late 70s and early 80s, that is extremely criticized for having a supposedly questionable plot and denouement. If we compare this movie to some of the other popular films directed by Dario Argento, we're probably going to think that 'Suspiria', is perhaps not as intriguing or well developed, when it comes to the story. To give a few examples of some of the Argento films that are widely considered the actual masterpieces because they offer an intriguing plot, good imagery and well done endings, I would probably name 'The Bird with the Crystal Plumage', 'Deep Red' and 'The Cat o' Nine Tails'. So what is it that we should believe? Nothing! Everyone is entitled to their own opinions and even though I agree with those who claim that 'Suspiria' is Argento's real masterpiece, I would never waste my time trying to convince people that this is true. As a matter of fact, I'll be honest and say that I also believe that 'Suspiria' has a somehow underdeveloped story, but I still regard it as one of the best horror movies in history. The reason is simple in my opinion, you can make something wonderful, without a wonderful plot. This is perhaps one of the most visually enchanting horror movies I have seen so far and I honestly doubt I will ever find another film that can enchant me as much as this one. Everything about 'Suspiria' is beautiful, even the violent deaths. I know this may sound sick and disgusting, but I believe Mr. Argento has the special gift to make beautiful images out of gruesome situations, like murder, for example. From the beginning until the end, this film takes us to a dark dreamland with beautiful contrasting colors, eerie locations and a recurrent unsettling music. The locations are perfect. The ballet school in which the story takes place, seems to be a nonexistent place taken from someone's dream. Indeed, it was revealed once that 'Suspiria' was partly inspired by a dream that Daria Nicolodi once had (Mrs. Nicolodi was the co-writer and Argento's girlfriend at the time). So if the idea was to create a dream-like movie, I would say they did a perfect job. Everything about 'Suspiria' looks surreal and charming. It's a dark fairy tale, in which the characters behave in a childish way, like playing along with the scenario. It is also said that the actresses were initially supposed to be little girls, but fearing that the film could be banned, Argento had to choose older actresses, but he didn't really change much of the dialogs, which I think is genius. Strangely, the characters don't come off as moronic or anything, they simply are strange and childish, but in a good way. The subject of sex, for example, is barely even mentioned, which is something that doesn't happen too often in horror movies with twenty-something year old characters. But regarding the actors who played these characters, I would mostly compliment the work of the late actresses Joan Bennett and Alida Valli. The young cast was simply fine, but no one did a remarkable job. Not even Jessica Harper, who was a bad choice for the lead character, in my opinion. This is probably the only little detail I would criticize about this film. Mrs. Harper pretty much has the same facial expression and tone of voice throughout the entire film, which is not good. On the other hand, like I said before, Mrs. Valli and Mrs. Bennett were flawless as the two bitter old women who run the school with their awful temper and their little psychological tortures against those who stand in their ways. So concluding 'Suspiria' is one of those films that you either love or hate. Both feelings are equally respectable and I can understand why some people don't really appreciate it. But if I have to recommend or 'sell' this movie to someone, I would definitely highlight the dream-like imagery and the creepy music composed by The Goblins, that go perfectly well with what is seen on the screen. Enjoy this dark fairy tale about witches and childish girls.

We pretty much know what's going to happen from the beginning.In case you don't know the story, four of Kane's (Gary Cooper's) old enemies, led by Frank Miller, seek him out in a small Western town where he serves as Marshall. They're going to come for him at high noon. He's got about an hour and a half to organize special deputies. His wife Amy (Grace Kelly) leaves him when he refuses to run from the coming conflict. And for one or another reason all of his old friends, even those who helped him clean up the town some years ago and put the chief heavy, Frank Miller, behind bars, refuse to help him. Some of the townspeople are sympathetic and some hate him. Kane has to spurn offers of help from a pathetic duo -- an abject drunk and a fourteen-year-old kid. There is a gun fight at the end. Guess who wins. Kane takes off his star and drops it into the dirt and he and Amy ride off into the sunset to open a store somewhere.It's a tightly written story, even in all its predictability, and the constant references to the clocks ticking down the minutes, plus the omnipresent dramatic chords of Dmitri Tiompkin's score, generate a good deal of tension.There are only two real scenes of action. One is the shoot out that's well staged but otherwise unmemorable. The other is a fist fight between Kane and his jealous subordinate, the Deputy Marshall Harvey Pell (Lloyd Bridges). It isn't a long scene but it's a bruising fight with both men being slugged repeatedly in the face. Cooper is so tall that when he falls backward to the stable floor it seems to take forever, as if in slow motion, his arms flailing. I felt his pain more acutely than I felt his fear for his life. When it's over, and Harvey lies unconscious, Kane is unable to walk away and must slump against a wall, holding his beaten face in his hands, gasping for breath. He seems completely exhausted.The story about the movie is almost as interesting as the film itself. Is it about blacklisting? (Kids You'll have to look that up.) A lot of people thought so, including Howard Hawks who was disgusted by the movie. No true Marshall would act like that, going around begging for help. So Hawks made Rio Bravo to tell his version of how it really works. The sheriff, John Wayne, turns away every offer of help but people show up when they're needed anyway.I don't actually believe it's a movie that's that pregnant with social comment. I think it's a movie about a Marshall who is deserted by all of his friends except his wife, who intrudes at the last minute, and it's commercially designed in every way, following as it does a classic narrative structure in which there are a series of increasingly serious minor climaxes, then the climax, then the denouement. The overarching plan could have been provided by a computer if they'd had computers. This isn't necessarily a weakness.

It's definitely done Coen-Style and it's hard to fault. Though minimalistic it's rich in detail with every scene...Many being so right they seem iconic. The mood is, however, not just dark, but quite mysterious providing a great undercurrent in the Hitchcockian vein. The cinematography is so good I must say I've never seen black and white with so many shades of gray giving it the mood for sure, but yet great detail. You need to see this on a good plasma TV like the Pioneer Kuro for some of the most amazing blacks ever. I also appreciate the way the DVD uses the entire 169 screen, without the black bars. It's an intimate film and it simply doesn't need a wider palate.Billy Bob Thornton is excellent as the conflicted man sleepwalking through life yet waiting for something that just might wake him up. He's just as disaffected as his Bad Santa character but with some sort of discipline that won't allow him to show any anger. That would make him The Man That Wasn't There and so he is. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent and besides Thornton there's a standout role played by the guy who plays Monk.I recommend this movie for any fan of forties film noir. It's really able to stand with some of the best of that rich era. The Dialogue is so good it seems to get better with the next viewing, and the next. It is about as good as a simple film can be, albeit one where every frame must have taken a week or so to compose! Don't miss it.

It was this hilarious little flick full of laughs and drama at every turn. The story line fills everyone with emotions that we all have felt before and keeps you guessing all the time. This movie will take you on a thrill ride and make you laugh till you drop. The movie is called The Cable Guy, (1996), featuring Jim Carrey, as the Cable Guy and Matthew Broderick as Steven Kovacs, and Leslie Mann as Robin Harris is sure to produce and is awarded with my two thumbs way up. It all starts off with Steven (Broderick) who is a middle aged man going through a tough time with his girlfriend Robin (Mann). He is living in a new place and is just moving in when the movie starts and his cable is not working. Therefore, we see him call the Cable Guy (Carrey). He calls and waits for hours for the Cable Guy to arrive, and then when in the shower, we can hear the maniacal CABLE GUY!! from Carrey's lips. Also, you can hear him knocking on the door. After this initial encounter with the Cable Guy, whose assumed name we learn is Chip Douglas, we start to feel out who Chip really is. We find that he is a man Hell bent on gaining friends and will do anything to fulfill his goals. He wants to gain a life that he never had before. We also, find out that he is from a very distinct and somewhat tragic background. His parents were never around really and so he was left with his only friend, the television. He was raised on television and has a vast knowledge of movies and shows alike. After, Chip fixes Steven's cable, they agree to be friends and start a friendship. The cinematic aspects at this point are very basic, but as the journey continues, they get more intimate and up-close. Chip starts to wreck havoc on Steven and Robin's lives. In one scene Steven and Chip are in Medieval Times and fight in the pit and the music and close up angles of the camera really catch this moment. Another scene where the camera uses a lot of low to high and close ups is a scene where Chip joins Steven and his friends for a pickup game of basketball. The shots by the camera make you feel as if you are on the court and in the game. As the movie goes on however, we start to see that Chip may be borderline psychotic. He is really desperate in his quest and is desperately trying to earn the trust and friendship of all he meets. It is this desperation that causes a lot of trouble throughout the movie. This is the more serious aspect of this movie. At one point in the film, Chip beats a man senseless and brutally just to fix things between Robin and Steven. He also, just gets very stalker-like and scary. This may be true for certain parts of the movie, but don't forget this movie has a very humorous side to it. Jim Carrey produces a very funny side. He is quick to reference numerous movies, such as the infamous hello Clarice... bit from Silence of the Lambs,(1991). He calls out the XENA warrior cry during the Medieval Times fight scene. Besides these comic bits, Jim Carrey is just Jim Carrey and will leave you dying of laughter in some of the scenes. It is just his nature and who he is. Broderick is also humorous in the film doing multiple dialogues with Carrey and not matching, but almost just as funny as Carrey. All and all, this film is a movie that will leave you thrilled and chock full o' laughter. It also leaves you wanting more and doing circles in your seat. The story line is one that I am sure many can relate to and it is definitely a movie for everyone. If you loved Jim Carrey as I did in the Ace Ventura Pet Detective, (1994) and Ace Ventura When Nature Calls, (1995), Then you will absolutely love The Cable Guy, (1996).

No, as a comedy this movie is simply too lacking, fore it's far too childish, totally predictable and just plain weak at parts.

It's not someone possessed by Jason Vorhees. It's not someone who is influenced in anyway by the evil of Jason Vorhees. It's just an ambulance driver that flips out after his retarded son is killed.No offense to Mr. Ambulance Driver, but his son was incredibly annoying and I really can't blame the psychotic loner who kills him for doing so. Having said that he is not the most annoying character in the film, that honour befalls that redneck, inbred, motor bike riding decapitation victim Billy.The plot here centres around Tommy Jarvis, the character who was played by Corey Feldman in Part Four and who was responsible for Jason's demise. The years have not been kind to Tommy's sanity and he finds himself at a mental hospital that looks a lot like the farm from Friday Part Three.I can only conclude that two of the characters in the movie are only there because they are incurable nymphomaniacs, because every scene they have in the movie is spent indulging their desires, including their murder out in the bush.Anyway, to rate this one fairly, I went back and watched again, and I can honestly say that knowing it isn't Jason from the start really helps you to appreciate this movie for what it is, which is fun 80s schlock horror. Some of the deaths are effective, Tommy's a nice character, and the killer, while choosing a rather extreme form of expression, is not without reason and purpose.Does this movie contain nudity and sex? You Bet! I mention that in every comment of mine because it is one of the most frequently asked questions from people considering movies to rent or buy.But it is a little better than people make it out to be.

He retaliates by slicing off both of her arms before cutting his own throat. Their young son Fenix witnesses the tragedy and unsurprisingly winds up in an mental hospital.Years later, Fenix escapes from the asylum and reunites with his mother, for whom he acts as a pair of replacement arms. Consumed by her hatred for lustful, moral-free women, Concha convinces her psychologically fragile son to aid her in a series of grisly murders.I first saw Alejandro Jodorowsky's Santa Sangre in 1989 as part of an all-night horror film festival, and I thought it was fantastic; however, since seeing a couple of the director's other films and finding them totally incomprehensible, I have often wondered whether my enjoyment of Santa Sangre was somehow enhanced that night by an extreme lack of sleep and a massive caffeine intake (lots of Pro-Plus washed down with Coke, I seem to remember).After nearly two decades of uncertainty, I have finally re-watched the film, and this time I was well rested and clear of artificial stimulants. Now I am finally sure... the film IS a masterpiece! Poetic and beautiful, yet twisted and savage, Santa Sangre is surreal art-house cinema with blood, meaning that it appeals to me on two very distinct levels the pretentious film snob in me can appreciate the artistry, the intriguing study of a fractured psyche, the religious symbolism, and the technical brilliance; and the gore-hound in me can get a kick out of the extreme violence.And, as if that wasn't enough, the film also features such bizarre delights as a dwarf in an Aladdin outfit, some coke-snorting Down's Syndrome kids partying with a fat whore, a dead elephant being torn apart by slum dwellers, brilliant music by Simon Boswell, several cool hallucinatory sequences, and an amazing twist ending that puts anything by M. Night Shyalaman to shame.In fact, I enjoyed Santa Sangre so much second time around, that perhaps I ought to give Jodorowsky's other films another chance to impress me.

And the FBI take his work seriously enough to drag him away from his fireside on grounds of 'national security' (I thought that was the remit of the CIA).

I have to say that upon at least that fundamental I entirely disagree. It is anything but. Confused would be a more suitable description, and lame.Once more it has the appearance that so many modern horror movies now possess the semblance to a montage of rip-offs.It starts out with a fairly promising intro. The camera pans across a series of gloomy wilderness tableaux, with suitably suspenseful theme music in a series of deep cords. Our attention is drawn to a solitary motorcar, picking its way along an empty, meandering road, dwarfed by threatening mountains. Now where have I seen that before? Ah yes; I remember - 'The Shining'.Notwithstanding this blatant rip-off, it's quite effective (though nowhere near so as the original) and curiosity is aroused.The vehicle contains two rather tiresome, bitchy bratesses, who seem to have 'victim' stamped all over them. My heart quails at the prospect of a hysterics-'n'-screams-fest.The hick town they're heading for is deserted, or so it seems. In fact; many of the houses are found to contain dead people, horribly disfigured. They look pretty grim. One of these young women, it seems, is a doctor, but she appears to offer very little explanation as to their condition. It's a mystery. Both have momentary visions of 'people'. and there are strange sounds. The telephones don't work (I bet £5 that they wouldn't). In one kitchen there's a pair of severed hands clutching a rolling pin. The oven timer 'pings'. I bet another £5 that there was a head in it (I lost; there were two).In the course of their wandering, the doctor and her companion encounter three deputies, also lately arrived. 'What the hell's going on?'. Oh it's just another second-rate horror movie, mate. As if to confirm this, the lights start going haywire. No thunderstorm as yet.The movie is called 'Phantoms'. And what with the creepy noises, power-supply problems and visionary flashes one might reasonably expect a bit of supernatural hokum. That's certainly what it seems to be leading towards. There are even cryptic messages scrawled on mirrors.Cue Peter O'Toole, making a pose as an ageing 'Spooky Mulder'. How are the mighty fallen? He's the proprietor of everything strange. And the FBI take his work seriously enough to drag him away from his fireside on grounds of 'national security' (I thought that was the remit of the CIA). A quick blast in a Lear jet and he's at the hick town. Not quite sure where they parked the plane.After a series of frightful deaths, it very soon becomes 'clear' that what they're actually dealing with is a smartypants worm, or super-colony of smartypants worms that think they're a god and need a good, stern talking to, followed by a bacterial infection enema to restore their sense of proportion. I kid you not.Cue some wretchedly inept CGI as this oak-tree sized worm-thing goes infection bonkers. Well that's another end-of-civilisation-as-we-know-it-situation narrowly averted. Dr O'Toole can go back to his fireside and gloat over his paycheque.Surprisingly, both bratesses survive.To be fair, there are some really tense moments and atmospheric situations. But the script is cornball, the acting is marginal, and the story is laughable. Special effects? You've seen them all before. Even Peter O'Toole fails to render any gravitas. He has the expression of one who is doing something slightly gross and undignified, and hopes that others (like his fellow thespians) will not see.As I say; it's a crummy little confection of ripped-off ideas. A slice of 'The Shining', a bit of 'The Blob' (the remake), a tincture of 'The Thing', a miniscule of 'Mimic' and a splash of 'Species' are immediately evident. A large bug gets a brief fly-on part, before biting-off a deputy's face and eating his brain (not much nutrition there, I would have thought) before buzzing-off, never to be seen again.

The story itself is basically how Spider-man came to be. On a field trip Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire) gets bit by a radioactive spider and gains powers from the bite. He not only has to struggle with making ends meet he has to struggle with a destructive lunatic called Green Goblin(Willem Dafoe)and also revealing his true feelings about his long-time friend, Mary Jane(Kirsten Dunst).This movie is so true to the comic book, its almost eerie. Tobey Maguire is great as Peter Parker\/Spider-Man, Willem Dafoe is excellent as The Green Goblin, J.K. Simmons is great as Jonah Jameson and even Aunt May and Uncle Ben are portrayed and acted accurately. The action sequences are pretty good and even though they use CGI its not an eyesore here as it is in other movies that use it heavily. My only gripe is I could do without the weak one-liners that appear once and awhile in the movie. All in all fans of the comic book as well as the cartoon series wont be disappointed.

Dick's 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' vision of the future, I stand amazed this was the one chosen for a film adaptation. Asimov, Clarke, Heinlein, Gifford, Patterson...others, have written reams of sci-fi(?) future history stories, any number of which would produce an enjoyable and intellectually-stimulating celluloid. In defense, however, Dick's tight, concise and mentally-graphic storytelling are the product of specific genius. The fact that director Scott and his 3-D, art-directed team 'got' Dick's vision is testament to adaptability from a great story line for film. In truth, a movie version of any of the aforementioned treatises would have forced a monstrous series of film productions instead of a regular, two-hour viewing conducive to a regular movie-going event (with few exceptions, 'series' often fail to produce box-office monies from the original construct).Having said that, Dick's tough storyline, the resultant and beautiful screen-play, art direction, studio and on-location construction, and Scott's direction, have made 'Blade Runner' a euphoric and time-honored cult classic. The fact that this was Hollywood's last, great effort on an analogue film (no special effects were produced by computer generation - unknown then) bears witness to true 'on-film' making graphical expertise. Cutting-edge, then, and still stands triumphant in spite of its age.In addition - and strongly in merit - the concept of hearkening a film-noir essence from the 30's to exact the nuances of a distopian future history, tied directly to an American republic past, is pure genius. All the un-loosed ends of our civil problems overpopulation, corporeal greed, castration of civil rights, global pollution...illegal governmental intravention...illegal aliens...are addressed one way or another in this dark, emotionally-charged but lens-clear vision of the multi-cultered American vision of our global future. It's as if the roots of our fatherhood slowly stood within the movie theatre and silently applauded, reckoning a civil duty. A film, and vision, vastly ahead of its time...In any movie, the music 'sets the tone' for its ambiance. Audiences as a whole - and individually - identify the theme of a film from its music. Scott was adroit in his choice of 'Vengelis' (Evangelos Odysseas Papathanassiouas) as the film's music author. A Greek music composer and self-taught musician (he has sold over 20 million albums), Vangelis is 65 years old now, and has understood - inimitably - the essence of film thematic music (he is an absolute 'film buff'). When you listen to his efforts to construct the theme music for this film (see, 2nd disc 'Blade Runner - The Final Cut'), you'll understand his pathos for this movie. One of the ultimate decisions to include this film within my 'All Time' favorites is Evangelos' empathetic and counter-point music, deftly underscoring the harsh realities of the film.
