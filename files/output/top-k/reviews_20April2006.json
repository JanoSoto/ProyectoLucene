In fact, I'd venture to say that this is one of the last movies to offer full-fledged excitement before current computer FX overwhelmed Hollywood so that all action films now have a veil of superficiality covering everything (yes, Speed also had computer FX, but they were surreptitious back then). I'd say, around the mid-nineties, after Seven or so, all the action films became closer to computer games rather than actual action-adventure FILMS. Speed was, in many ways, a last gasp of film action in the pure sense - you feel that pulse of the old-style slam-bang dazzle right from the opening credits, moving down an elevator shaft which could be a computer simulation, but immediately it gives way to classic jeopardy involving flesh-and-blood villains (Hopper), sweaty victims-in-peril, and sweatier tough cops-as-heroes (Reeves, Daniels) coping with horrendous dilemmas. OK, some of the modern bland action thrills already pervaded this thriller, but it's still much too real compared to all the silly moving pictures pervading our theaters in the 21st century.This is also that rare film which really never has a slow moment. Some might label that aspect as unrealistic, but this is what it was meant to be - it's de Bont's finest hour; he was a director of photography before this and produced only adequate pictures after this. Somehow, he captured a perfect formula for this, his inaugural stewardship. It's great for a first viewing, but I was caught up in watching this several times in the nineties, to try and duplicate those visceral shocks a 2nd & 3rd time. I also found it was one of those movies I could watch with a couple of other people in the room and get caught up in the excitement as a group experience - there was never time to speak of other matters during some slow spots, as in during most other films. We, meaning the audience, are on that bus with the passengers after the first half-hour and for the next hour of a super-ride that everyone needs to experience at least once in their lifetime. And you'll probably want to give it a try at least one more time afterward.Reeves' performance as the hero is an aberration for his film career. All the reasons to be mystified by his success in movies or his penchant for slow-witted, laughable characters are missing. He'd had a chance to play a straight action hero before, in Point Break, but he was an older boy there; here he's a young man, a coiled spring built in the mold of serious action heroism. When he threatens the deranged villain, there's no chance to mock his style, to be amused at his efforts at intensity - he's a lethal, dangerous figure here. I almost believe now that some substitute for Reeves was placed in most of his scenes here, since he never returned to such effective presence. Then, of course, we have Bullock. This was where her impish quality, with some moxie thrown in, got its greatest workout - no surprise at all that she became a big star after this. To say that she manages the perfect note in all her scenes is...well, let's just leave it at that. Plummer in a brief role as the jaguar driver - priceless! (He returned in the weak sequel, against all odds). Hopper and Daniels, as well as Morton, lend great support, as do all the supporting players on the bus (Ruck and the big guy playing Ortiz stand out). And speaking of the bus... I state now and for the record, no movie has ever utilized a bus to better effect - ever!

Cool Runnings tackles all of these themes head-on without losing an ounce of its charm, humour, or family-fun.A superbly played Joseph Gruel is the prime embodiment of the racism the Jamaicans face on the hill, and his story is very moving. So too is the voyage of self-discovery and forgiveness embarked on by disgraced coach Erv Blitzer (John Candy). The team themselves are a wonderful advert for teamwork and the little island of Jamaica. Each one is wise, bold in the face of their respective adversity, and has an intriguing story to tell.The ending of Cool Runnings also ranks as one of the greatest. It masterfully avoids the back-slapping, one-dimensional and predictable ending it looks to be approaching, a trap that so many other similar 'feel-good' films fall into. Instead Cool Runnings brings together all of the themes that have been explored, in one emotionally charged final scene.99% will disagree with something I have written above. But I first watched the film 15 years ago and it has stayed with me ever since. I have watched it around 100 times now, and I still shed a tear at the end...no other film has ever brought me even close to that.If you take nothing else from this review. Watch Cool Runnings. It is so much better than the clever-arsed, blockbuster-biased critics will have you believe. Forget the highly forgettable cheese like Remember the Titans, The Mighty Ducks and all the rest.

While it's true I've never seen any of Woo's work from his early days which is touted as action art but I have seen Windtalkers, Paycheck, Face\/Off, Broken Arrow and of course Mission Impossible 2. Woo brings to the table an incredible unique style...TOO unique. He has to make everything with John Woo stamped all over it and tries to make action...art and it's not!! Action is action...it's adrenalin pumping, edge of your seat, holler for the hero...you don't care whether their movements and choreography is beautiful and in the process of making this unique piece of art John Woo lost the magic that was Mission Impossible.Tom Cruise returns as nice guy secret agent, with a bit more of an edge, Ethan Hunt. Hunt definitely is tougher, grittier and yet falls deeply in love in this Mission. He still plays the role well and no one fulfills the screen presence like Cruise. The hair was wild!! Almost unexplainable?? The long, greasy locks was not very becoming and certainly cut back on the clean cut Ethan Hunt we knew from the original. Although tougher and grittier it just felt like his character wasn't as smart and throughout all the wild stunts and fights which are practically 100% done in slow motion, he loses something in his character. Dougray Scott takes the helm as the bad guy, Sean Ambrose. Instead of being Ethan's mentor, this time he is his stand in for many missions and he's tired of being in the shadow. Scott is decent and plays the bad guy well but in all honestly he doesn't stand a chance against Cruise. He never poses a viable threat and you just sit back and wait for him to get his butt kicked. Thandie Newton plays the Mission Impossible girl, Nyah Nordoff-Hall. Ethan falls madly in love with her at first sight, completely out of the blue and then must protect her as she goes deep undercover with her former lover Sean Ambrose. Despite horrible reviews Newton is not AWFUL...she's a million miles from great but she's okay. Her and Cruise have some strong sexual tension but otherwise the romantic chemistry is fleeting. She's kind of whiny and annoying for someone who is supposed to be a strong female and a brilliant thief. Ving Rhames returns as Hunt's partner Luther Stickell and his role is a little bigger this time around which is a welcome addition. He adds to the cast nicely. Richard Roxburgh plays Hench man and bad guy Hugh Stamp. His role is pretty quiet but effective and in fact he might have made a better major villain than Dougray Scott. His suspicious nature and his brutal facial expressions are fun to watch and even though Scott does get the better of him several times it's not believable and you keep waiting for Roxburgh to take him out. And finally giving Mission Impossible that touch of experience and class that Jon Voight and Vanessa Redgrave did to the original is Anthony Hopkins as Hunt's boss. Despite being a relatively small role he has some very effective and memorable lines. To lie to a man and sleep with him, she's a woman, she has all the training she needs. This is not Mission Difficult Mr. Hunt, it's Mission Impossible, difficult should be a walk in the park for you. It's unfortunate he didn't have a bigger role.Parts of Mission Impossible were kept in tact in order to make it as good as the original but in my humble movie going opinion it was the decision of bringing director John Woo on board that made the film nearly a joke. Fortunately with such strong actors, and some decent action scenes the film was pulled from obscurity but just barely. What should have and could have been one of the best fights in action film history between Ethan Hunt and Sean Ambrose in the end turned into some sort of choreographed dance routine done in slow motion with flowing clothing and hair and some sort of half-assed wrestling maneuvers that looked like it hurt them more than the other guy they were doing it too. The idea of a virus being stole was good and also opened up the window for a near replay of Hunt's daring theft in the original and although it wasn't bad as Hunt narrowly dives down into fan shafts, it just didn't come across as well. Mission Impossible II is okay and it's worth seeing if not just because the first was so incredible and hopefully the third will put this series back on track but so far number II definitely falls short of what the original was. The action is less, the romance is overwhelming and a little hokey, the fight scenes are far too dance like and the plot is still a little muddled and you wonder often what's going on.

While it's true I've never seen any of Woo's work from his early days which is touted as action art but I have seen Windtalkers, Paycheck, Face\/Off, Broken Arrow and of course Mission Impossible 2. Woo brings to the table an incredible unique style...TOO unique. He has to make everything with John Woo stamped all over it and tries to make action...art and it's not!! Action is action...it's adrenalin pumping, edge of your seat, holler for the hero...you don't care whether their movements and choreography is beautiful and in the process of making this unique piece of art John Woo lost the magic that was Mission Impossible.Tom Cruise returns as nice guy secret agent, with a bit more of an edge, Ethan Hunt. Hunt definitely is tougher, grittier and yet falls deeply in love in this Mission. He still plays the role well and no one fulfills the screen presence like Cruise. The hair was wild!! Almost unexplainable?? The long, greasy locks was not very becoming and certainly cut back on the clean cut Ethan Hunt we knew from the original. Although tougher and grittier it just felt like his character wasn't as smart and throughout all the wild stunts and fights which are practically 100% done in slow motion, he loses something in his character. Dougray Scott takes the helm as the bad guy, Sean Ambrose. Instead of being Ethan's mentor, this time he is his stand in for many missions and he's tired of being in the shadow. Scott is decent and plays the bad guy well but in all honestly he doesn't stand a chance against Cruise. He never poses a viable threat and you just sit back and wait for him to get his butt kicked. Thandie Newton plays the Mission Impossible girl, Nyah Nordoff-Hall. Ethan falls madly in love with her at first sight, completely out of the blue and then must protect her as she goes deep undercover with her former lover Sean Ambrose. Despite horrible reviews Newton is not AWFUL...she's a million miles from great but she's okay. Her and Cruise have some strong sexual tension but otherwise the romantic chemistry is fleeting. She's kind of whiny and annoying for someone who is supposed to be a strong female and a brilliant thief. Ving Rhames returns as Hunt's partner Luther Stickell and his role is a little bigger this time around which is a welcome addition. He adds to the cast nicely. Richard Roxburgh plays Hench man and bad guy Hugh Stamp. His role is pretty quiet but effective and in fact he might have made a better major villain than Dougray Scott. His suspicious nature and his brutal facial expressions are fun to watch and even though Scott does get the better of him several times it's not believable and you keep waiting for Roxburgh to take him out. And finally giving Mission Impossible that touch of experience and class that Jon Voight and Vanessa Redgrave did to the original is Anthony Hopkins as Hunt's boss. Despite being a relatively small role he has some very effective and memorable lines. To lie to a man and sleep with him, she's a woman, she has all the training she needs. This is not Mission Difficult Mr. Hunt, it's Mission Impossible, difficult should be a walk in the park for you. It's unfortunate he didn't have a bigger role.Parts of Mission Impossible were kept in tact in order to make it as good as the original but in my humble movie going opinion it was the decision of bringing director John Woo on board that made the film nearly a joke. Fortunately with such strong actors, and some decent action scenes the film was pulled from obscurity but just barely. What should have and could have been one of the best fights in action film history between Ethan Hunt and Sean Ambrose in the end turned into some sort of choreographed dance routine done in slow motion with flowing clothing and hair and some sort of half-assed wrestling maneuvers that looked like it hurt them more than the other guy they were doing it too. The idea of a virus being stole was good and also opened up the window for a near replay of Hunt's daring theft in the original and although it wasn't bad as Hunt narrowly dives down into fan shafts, it just didn't come across as well. Mission Impossible II is okay and it's worth seeing if not just because the first was so incredible and hopefully the third will put this series back on track but so far number II definitely falls short of what the original was. The action is less, the romance is overwhelming and a little hokey, the fight scenes are far too dance like and the plot is still a little muddled and you wonder often what's going on. Add into that the cast just wasn't as strong as the original and you have a sub par sequel.

Perhaps the best-known neo-noir was Polanski's Chinatown from the seventies, and L.A. Confidential can be seen as a Chinatown for the nineties. Both films are period pieces, set some forty years before they were made. Both are set in the Los Angeles area, as were many of the classic noirs. Both are in colour rather than black-and-white, but both have a typically complex noir plot, involving widespread corruption and wrongdoing.L.A. Confidential is set in the Los Angeles of the 1950s. The heroes are three officers of the city's police force, with very different characters. The classic films noirs generally took a cynical view of human nature, and neo-noir has followed this tradition. All three men can be seen as flawed heroes. Bud White is a man of action, with a violent, unpredictable streak, not above beating up suspects he believes to be guilty or planting evidence on them to secure a conviction. Bud's particular anger is reserved for men who use violence against women; at the root of this lie bitter memories of his own childhood, when his mother was murdered by his father.Like Bud, Edmund Exley has lost a parent to violence; his father, himself a police officer, was murdered by a criminal. In other respects, however, he seems to be Bud's exact opposite. Exley is a quiet, calm officer who insists on doing everything by the book, refusing to use Bud's methods to obtain a conviction, even when encouraged to do so by his cynical superior Captain Dudley Smith. When a group of officers bring the force into disrepute by beating up a number of Mexican detainees, Exley is prepared to earn the hatred of his colleagues by naming names. Exley's flaw is that he seems too good to be true. His sense of integrity can coincide too neatly with his own advantage; we sense that he informs on his colleagues not because he cares for justice for the Mexicans but in order to advance his own career.Jack Vincennes also leaves us with the impression that he is uninterested in justice. Indeed, he does not seem very interested in police work at all. His main interest is his lucrative sideline as adviser to a TV cop show which enables him to mix with actors and other glamorous celebrities. Vincennes also has a corrupt deal with Sid Hudgens, the editor of a scandal-mongering magazine called Hush-Hush, whereby he will, in exchange for money, provide Hudgens with information about which celebrities are about to be arrested on drugs or vice charges.The three are brought together by the investigation into the shooting of a number of patrons of a diner called The Night Owl. At first it seems that the killings were carried out in the course of a robbery, but it emerges that the suspected robbers arrested in connection with the crime are in fact innocent. As inquiries proceed, the three officers begin to uncover an increasingly complex web of corruption and crime, involving Hudgens's magazine, a businessman who runs a brothel where the prostitutes have had plastic surgery to look like famous film stars, the police themselves, and the struggle to inherit the empire once controlled by the city's now-imprisoned gangland boss. The three have never been friends- indeed Exley and White hate one another, partly because White was one of the men fingered by Exley, partly because of rivalry over Lynn, the beautiful Veronica Lake look-alike from the brothel. Nevertheless, they find that they must work together in order to survive.Unlike some, I was not too concerned that this film did not win the Best Picture Oscar, as Titanic, although a very different film, is nevertheless a good one in its own right. I was, however, surprised that there was not a single Best Actor nomination for the male leads, Russell Crowe as White, Guy Pearce as Exley and Kevin Spacey as Vincennes, as all three are excellent, with equally good support from Danny de Vito as Hudgens and James Cromwell as Captain Smith. (This was the film that first brought Crowe and Pearce, both Antipodeans, to public notice). I was delighted by Kim Basinger's Best Supporting Actress award, as this confirmed what I had long suspected, namely that she is a major talent as well as a major-league beauty. She brings a touching freshness and innocence to the role of Lynn, even though she was already in her mid-forties at the time.The success of this film is due as much to the direction as to the acting. Curtis Hanson had made some good films before this one, notably The Hand that Rocks the Cradle and The River Wild, but those were both in the standard thriller mould. L.A.

Robert Redford, who had actually turned down the role twice before director and friend Sydney Pollack talked him into taking the part, displays some of the best reflective acting ever seen on the big screen and effectively brings forth the dark side of being stereotyped as the All-American golden boy (although Redford did not receive an Oscar nod for playing Hubbell in this film, he was nominated for Best Actor that same year for his light comedic performance in THE STING).THE WAY WE WERE is different from most romances in that it is not death, feuding families, or any other societal phenomena that directly tear the couple apart. Katie and Hubbell are simply passionate individuals with highly volatile, and contrasting, ideologies; the conflict of which is expressed in several brilliantly written and acted scenes that shimmer with the type of intelligence and honesty that is rarely seen in cinema today. The film's enduring popular success with the mass audience may very well be due to the magnetic chemistry between Streisand and Redford, the gorgeous cinematography, and the strong directorial hand supplied by Pollack. However, it is the complexity of the romance with politics and the strong characterizations by both leads that continues to make THE WAY WE WERE the best love story for adults.

All the characters are cool, and while it is funny it is also suspenseful at times, plus Christian Slater and Cameron Diaz are simply amazing in this!. However this film will not be for everyone as it's an acquired taste of humor, and I am probably one of the few who found the ending quite funny, plus Cameron Diaz plays one of the most annoying bitches I have ever seen!, but boy was she amazing at it!. Slater is also very good as the self absorbed psycho, and while I didn't root for any of the characters, I was able to feel for them at times because it was a tough situation, plus it's pretty well made and written as well. There were a couple of scenes that were just sick and unfunny but most of them were funny, and one of my favorite moments in the film is when Daniel Stern freaks out at the gas station store as that was funny, plus it kept me guessing throughout for the most part. This is a pretty good Black\/Comedy that's quite funny and well made, with a solid story and amusing performances, I highly recommend it. The Direction is very good! Peter Berg does a very good job here with good camera work, solid angles and keeping the film funny and at a fast pace. The Acting is awesome!. Jon Favreau is excellent as the lead, he underplayed it and I dug that, he also had some great scenes with Diaz and was quite likable, I really dug him. Leland Orser is very good as one of the friends I liked him as well. Cameron Diaz is incredibly gorgeous and is amazing as always and is amazing here, she plays one of the most annoying bitches I have ever seen in a film, but she was just so amazing at it, she really is a versatile actress ! (Diaz Rules!!!!!!!). Christian Slater is also amazing as always and is amazing here, he played the self absorbed psycho really well, and put a grin on my face a lot of the time, I really liked his performance here! (Slater Rules!!!!!!!). Jeremy Piven is OTT here and it works, he was hysterically funny, I felt bad for him, he rocked!. Daniel Stern is awesome here he was just so paranoid and worrying all the time I couldn't help but find it funny, but I also felt sorry for him too. Jeanne Tripplehorn does what she has to do adequately as the wife. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall I highly recommend it. ***1\/2 out of 5 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 April 2006","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" This is a pretty good Black\/Comedy that's quite funny and well made, with a solid story and amusing performances!.

Typical Westerns are set in arid semi-deserts, full of blazing skies, blazing shotguns, and blazing tempers. Here, the dank, chilly Pacific Northwest permits, or rather demands, a different range of emotions poignancy, regret, wintry melancholy. This film takes many risks, using Leonard Cohen's haunting ballads on the soundtrack and shooting scenes in very low light, but remarkably, everything coheres.The film features Altman's trademark group scenes with overlapping dialogue, but not his typical interlocking plot lines. True to its title, the story centers on gambler and brothel owner John McCabe (Warren Beatty) and his shrewd business partner, Mrs. Constance Miller (Julie Christie). Still, supporting characters always hover at the edges, taking part in vignettes that underline the movie's themes and occasionally provide some humor. In this way, the movie avoids the chaos and confusion of some Altman films, while always remaining aware that the main characters are part of a larger community. It's a perfect balance both clear and complex.Still, McCabe & Mrs. Miller is more a study of place and character than a narrative drama. The small, isolated settlement of Presbyterian Church is newly built, but already seems to molder. Ironically, McCabe's brothel is the most civilized place in town it is built quickly and even gets painted, while the church remains half-finished. No families, parents or children live in this bleak town, just a bunch of weary miners and whores who delude and distract themselves. They all have dreams, but barely know how to achieve them; for this reason, they're sympathetic and all too human. McCabe is a true anti-hero, a guy who thinks he's a slick, wisecracking gambler, but his jokes fall flat and he lacks common sense. Mrs. Miller seems confident and shameless, but she secretly uses opium to dispel the pain of living. At times, the movie is well aware of how it subverts the clichés of the Western genre to reflect what would really have happened out West. For instance, there is a final shootout, but it arises because of a quarrel over business&#151;there are no Indians, no outlaws, and no sheriffs here! But McCabe & Mrs. Miller is much more than just a clever exercise in revisionism; it's never overtly satirical or mean-spirited. It keenly observes its world and then comments on it, overlaying everything with a delicate sense of poignancy and loss. This is the kind of film that stays with you, but not because of sharp dialogue, beautiful images, or showy performances. Greater than the sum of its parts, McCabe & Mrs. Miller is memorable for the pervasive but understated mood that runs through every frame, creating a truly atmospheric and humanistic film.

You can understand the thinking &#x96; before CG made it possible for everyone to do, Disney seemed to have a policy of making every movie with talking animals, from Cinderella to The Lion King. And while the techniques may have changed, the formula remains the same with kiddie-friendly entertainment wrapped around a sugary sweet moral tale. In that respect, Stuart Little is the classic children's film given a fresh lick of paint but if you do the basics right, classic can still work.Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie play the Littles, a successful family living in a small old-fashioned terrace house in New York with their young son George (Jonathan Lipnicki) and their cat Snowbell (voiced by Nathan Lane). When the Littles decide to adopt a brother for George, they come back with an adorable mouse named Stuart (voiced by Michael J Fox). But neither George nor Snowbell initially take to Stuart's arrival and before long, Snowbell begins to form a plan to make sure Stuart's stay with the Littles is a brief one.I can't fault the technical aspect of Stuart Little as the little blighter looks fantastic. And like most kids films, everything is bright and colourful from set design to costumes. Performances from the three leads are also good with Laurie's American accent frighteningly realistic. But while the film is perfectly harmless fun for the little ones, I'm afraid that there isn't much there for the grown-ups to enjoy. It's more of a technical showcase than an entertaining movie and reminded me of the similarly themed film Cats And Dogs. Yes, Stuart himself looks so cute and realistic but it's a pity that same effort and attention didn't go to the rest of the film as it never really engages you or holds your interest for very long.In some ways, there is nothing wrong with Stuart Little as it does pretty much exactly what it says on the tin. It's undemanding family fun that definitely appeals to children more than it does to adults. But it feels too long and the plot never really gets going, although things do pick up when the running battle between Snowbell and Stuart reaches its climax in Central Park. But I found myself wondering why nobody questioned the insanity of legally adopting a talking mouse but maybe that speaks more about my cynicism than anything else.

But the good news for those thinking that it's just another Harrison Ford-saves-the-world vehicle may be pleasantly surprised. The studio aside, it is a Polanski film, and it does go against what would typically be a Hollywood film of this story. For one thing Polanski at the time was persona non Grata in America, filming in Paris, and there is a much more European feel to the film than any given American director would've given it. Here and there with some of the shots, the depth used as well as the length, reminded me slightly of Antonioni.

Their search leads them through crooked gangsters, dangerous, terrorist Arabs, and a certain device hidden in a statue (one almost wishes this wasn't revealed, but as a Maguffin it only matters as a point of wanting for the enemy). Through this Polanski uses his star to get a taut performance, where the only heroism comes in being provoked to the edge as the everyman Ford occasionally plays. If you're looking for Indiana Jones, this ain't it. Taking part in an Ennio Morricone score- albeit with a couple of meh songs- and great usage of Parisian settings, Polanski's film is competently directed, with some scenes that lose steam while others remain charged as hell.

It also had considerable difficulty at the box office. After opening with strong numbers, the $45 million budgeted film took a nose dive and did not recover. It ended up taking in $46 million domestically ($65 million worldwide), which was a respectable take, but far from the blockbuster status of films like A STAR IS BORN or THE PRINCE OF TIDES. When considering all of the above information, it's a bit surprising to discover that the film is nothing more than an entertaining and heart-felt romantic comedy. In hindsight, it's hard to understand why a such a harmless and light-weight film became such a lighting rod for scathing reviews and harsh comments.While the storyline is predictable, the movie is actually very well-done with a brisk pace, compelling characters, and a witty screenplay. The finale may come down a bit heavy-handed on the message end, but the build-up is effective enough to merit this indulgence. Though MIRROR doesn't match her previous two directorial efforts, Streisand does once again pull off the various actress\/producer\/director roles with great efficiently, and this results in an effective star vehicle for the then-54-year-old film legend. Jeff Bridges received a lot of flack for his completely unselfconscious portrayal, but I admire how completely he throws himself into the silly role. Lauren Bacall is brilliantly biting and luminous in her turn as Streisand's mother, a role that earned her first (and so far only) Oscar nomination. Mimi Rogers is also fun as Streisand's slutty younger sister, as is Brenda Vaccaro as her self-deprecating best friend - although Pierce Brosnan is wasted as a gigolo-like suitor. All in all, an enjoyably fluffy film, undeserving of the criticism it routinely receives.

After all that I'd heard about this film, I really wasn't expecting it to be very good; but Stuart Gordon has once again proved his worth as a horror director with this excellent tale of terror! Castle Freak sees a great director doing what he does best. Gordon's love for HP Lovecraft is well documented, and Castle Freak sees him in distinctly different territory from where he was with previous successes From Beyond and Re-Animator. Castle Freak is a slower film than those two mentioned, but it's all the better for it. The story is the strongest element of the movie and at all times is at least as interesting as the central horror theme. We follow a family who move to a castle in Spain after it is inherited by the father. However, they are marred by tragedy ever since a car accident cost them their young son, and the daughter her sight. The tragedy continues when they move into their new home only to discover that they aren't the only inhabitants within the sinister castle's walls.Like all the best Stuart Gordon films, this one is lead by the great cult star Jeffrey Combs. Like the director, the lead star has found himself with a role that is nothing like the one that made him famous. However, Combs doesn't falter and his performance here sees him really prove himself as an actor. The script puts a lot of weight on the characters, and it is this that ensures Castle Freak is a cut above the majority of nineties horror films. Combs gets into his character excellently, and as the script allows his motives to be adequately explained, the cult star is given more than enough opportunity to ensure that he stands out. Combs is joined by From Beyond and Re-Animator co-star Barbara Crampton, as well as Jessica Dollarhide in her only film role and Jonathan Fuller, who had a role in Gordon's The Pit and the Pendulum. The rest of the cast is largely made up of European stars, which help to cement the film's Spanish location. The castle at the centre of the tale, with its many rooms, provides an excellent environment for horror of this kind, and Gordon makes best use of this to draw in a claustrophobic and horrific atmosphere. Overall, this film is highly underrated; Castle Freak manages to take in elements of horror, tragedy, love and loss all tightly wound around a distinctly Lovecraftian horror story.
