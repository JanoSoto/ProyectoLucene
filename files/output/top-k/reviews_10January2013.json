According to the story, several years before, SETI (The Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence) had received a signal from an alien civilization. They interpreted it as having been a friendly signal sent in response to signals from earth. The signal included an alien DNA code, in response to a human DNA code that had been sent into space. The scientists decided to implant the alien DNA into a human ovum to make an alien- human hybrid creature. OK. (I suppose the opening is thought provoking as well, in depicting this poor, human looking young girl locked in what was little more than a comfortable cage with little contact with anyone, but it was the ending quote I found most thought provoking - from Dr. Baker she was half us and half something else. I wonder what half was the predatory half? Good question! (Maybe the aliens tried the same experiment with our DNA with equally disastrous results and were trying to get back at us!)You see, this hybrid was predatory. It was a killer. It grew rapidly, reached maturity quickly and had the desire to mate and reproduce and would do whatever it took to find the right partner. If that included killing, so be it. But, yeah, from what we were told, the aliens seemed friendly enough. So where did the predatory half come from? Us? Interesting, and thought-provoking enough that it actually made me raise my estimation of the movie just a bit.Having said, that, this is overall not a great movie. It has some moments. No doubt about that. Some of the animation - revolving around the alien in the underground caverns near the end of the movie - was pretty primitive looking, though. There was really no need for Dr. Baker and Preston (Michael Madsen) to get together romantically, and Forrest Whitaker's character of the empath Dan seemed really out of place. In fact, the movie seemed to reach its silliest pretty early on when Xavier (Ben Kingsley) gathered this team who had been brought together to search out and destroy the creature, looked at Preston (who was some sort of special ops\/government hit man type) and said to him as the non-scientist among us ... THE non-scientist? Are we to infer that Xavier considered an empath to be a scientist? Pretty silly line. One line, yes, but it stuck in my head for some reason. Anyway.The cast here is a very interesting one. It ranges from the very well known and accomplished Ben Kingsley to the (at the time) unknown and not at all accomplished Natasha Henstridge, who has never really built a major acting career out of this beginning. She's quite beautiful, but she didn't really blow me away. (As an aside, when I lived for a few years in Newfoundland, I lived near her home town of Springdale and actually knew a couple of people who were related to her and some who knew her as a child when the family would return home to visit after moving away. I actually was living there when this movie was released, so it created quite a buzz that one of Newfoundland's own was starring in a movie!) Between Kingsley and Henstridge, there were other faces, some (like Whitaker or Alfred Molina) better known (to me anyway) than others (such as Madsen or Helgenberger.) So there was quite a range of talent and experience in this. Kingsley's character looked a bit silly in the end as he picked up the flame thrower to go after the creature. I still see him as Ghandi, I guess, and Ghandi with a flame thrower is not an image my brain can process easily!

Ada has been a mute since she was 6 years old, and as she explains in her narration, no-one knows why. Stewart's friend Baines (Harvey Keitel) takes an interest in the piano and offers Stewart land in exchange for it, as well as lessons from Ada, to which Stewart agrees. Offering the chance to earn her piano back, Baines wants one visit per black key on the piano from Ada, who he is seemingly infatuated with.Australian director Jane Campion's erotically-charged Gothic love story was a huge success back in 1993, winning the Best Actress Academy Award for Holly Hunter and Best Supporting Actress for Paquin, who became the second youngest recipient ever. Hunter's shadowy Ada is the backbone of The Piano, and while it may appear that it is her piano that fuels her passion, it is very much her own mind and experiences that dictate her actions. She is quite a fascinating character - not merely the put-upon mute who longs for love and her piano - she is actually rather subtly manipulative and sexually powerful, weighing up the two love interests in her life, and playing a dangerous power game with her increasingly jealous husband.The contrast between the two men in Ada's life couldn't be any obvious - Stewart playing dutiful, business-minded and quite inept in courtship, while Baines is hulking, living out in the forest, his face spotted with native Maori tattoos - but it is quite clear as to where Campion's preferences life. Ada's scenes with Baines, in which he listens to her play, become the centrepiece for some highly erotic moments, playing out more like animal foreplay than anything human. Ada seems not to bat an eyelid when Baines lies on the floor by her feet, fingering a hole in her stocking, or simply walks around the room completely naked. While these unconventional actions are there to channel Ada's sexual repression\/release and Baines' animalistic nature, these scenes often appear forced, filled with lazy or nonsensical metaphors passed of as spiritual film-making.As with many Australian period films, The Piano looks stunning. The exotic location is not filmed through a sun-tinted lens, and nor does it capture any of the colourful wildlife (something you would expect if Terence Malick had directed it), but is grey, wet and muddy. Like Peter Weir's Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975) and Gallipoli (1981), it has that lived-in feel, with Hunter's beautiful, ghostly face evoking a 19th- century photograph, where everyone looks grim and pale, and Campion's occasionally snapshot approach captures the mundane, everyday actions of the period. The performances are a revelation, with Hunter and Paquin deserving their accolades, and Keitel proving a formidable presence (I'll not mention the accent). The Piano is personal film-making, but too often the film seems to be striving for that mystical atmosphere rather than actually capturing it, occasionally getting lost amongst Campion's obvious adoration for her protagonist.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com ","genre":null},{"date":"10 January 2013","score":"","review":" Ada (Holly Hunter) arrives at a rainy New Zealand coast to meet her new husband - the gently-spoken frontiersman Stewart (Sam Neill) - along with her precious grand piano and her illegitimate daughter Flora (Anna Paquin).

Brooks's BROADCAST NEWS, where he played a brilliant reporter who failed as an on-air newscaster because he perspired more than Nixon.) Brooks's characters tend to be anti-heroes who are so obsessed with being politically correct and doing the right thing that it never occurs to them how obnoxious they are. (In Brooks's REAL LIFE 1979, he played a documentary filmmaker who nearly drove his subjects to nervous breakdowns.) But in MOTHER, Brooks has made a noble effort to meet his audience more than halfway, and he's definitely worth the trouble.Brooks plays John Henderson, a science-fiction writer who begins the movie in the middle of arranging his second divorce. (Trying to look at the bright side, John says of his ex, She brought great furniture to the marriage.) Doing some navel-gazing, John concludes that his problems with women stem from unresolved issues with his mother (Debbie Reynolds, in a welcome return to the movies). So he informs his mother that he wants to move back in with her as an experiment. The experimental situation includes returning his old room to its 1970's splendor, complete with tacky posters and a stereo blasting at all hours of the night.John's mother has been widowed and on her own for many years, and she doesn't take kindly to the thought of re-raising her son. But she gives as good as she gets, feeding John old food from her freezer (the freezer burn, she reasons, is a protective coating), and informing total strangers of John's failures with women.

I haven't known anyone who's seen MOTHER who didn't nudge me or anyone nearby and recognize themselves in the movie's relationships.

beginning' and the remake. part 3 to me is just boring dull, and tries to hard without delivering anything of worth, it turned leatherface into a generic slasher figure, but that does not even compare to what kim henkel has done to him in this movie, here he is a screaming transvestite, who loves wearing womens clothes and putting make up on, and although its true he chases people with a chainsaw, this is not the same leatherface. i know there are people out there who will say, but he wore a pretty women mask in the original, yes he did for one scene, but he never donned a dress and makeup, its stupid. the movie itself is a bad one, its rubbish and horribly made, not as well made as part three, but much more enjoyable, there are some cool little references to the original and homages, but it

Brooks's funniest. Having made his reputation with the 2000-Year-Old Man, it seems inevitable that Brooks would eventually take on the spectrum (or sphincter, as he might put it) of world history. And in the age of the Farrelly Brothers, Brooks' ideas about bad taste seem almost quaint.It begins with a lot of black-out gags (the first such gag amounting to, Ape Man = Onan) and takes off from there. The first sustained sequence, The Roman Empire, probably goes on a bit too long, and it introduced a buxom actress named Mary-Margaret Humes who, justifiably, went right back to obscurity shortly after the film's release. But there are also many enjoyable moments Gregory Hines's mellow film debut, Madeline Kahn's ecstatic song tribute to her well-endowed male slaves, and most of all, the Last Supper sequence at the end--completely messed up time-wise (it puts Jesus and Leonardo da Vinci in the same shot), but all the more hilarious because of it. (John Hurt plays Jesus, and as in Brooks' Spaceballs, his straight-faced seriousness just makes the insanity around him that much funnier.) The next sequence is one of Brooks' best The Spanish Inquisition as a Marx Brothers-style musical number, with Mel Brooks as a socko Torquemada, beating out a rhythm on his victim's shackled knees. This sequence alone justifies Brooks's existence as a comedy director.The sequence depicting The French Revolution, has two main objectives in mind show off as much of (1) British comedienne Pamela Stephenson's bust and (2) Brooks's wee-wee humor as humanly possible. Nevertheless, it has its moments, with Cloris Leachman as Madame Defarge, and Brooks as a randy king.The final short sequence, a trailer for Brooks's non-existent History Part II, is worth the bother just for one of those moments that makes me laugh for no discernible reason a scene from Hitler on Ice, showing Brooks' favorite nasty German as an Ice Capader. This ersatz trailer is enough to make me wish Brooks had really made a sequel. I doubt it would have turned out any worse than Spaceballs.

The movie is the story of two escaped convicts, African-American Noah Cullen (Sidney Poitier) who hates white people, and bigot white man, John 'Joker' Jackson (Tony Curtis), whom hates blacks. Both men find themselves both shackled to one another after surviving a prisoner transport car wreck. Seeing a way to escape, both men travel the back roads eluding posses, cops, and the law on their quest for freedom. Both actors were able to get down and dirty for the role, but literally as most of the scenes have them lying down in dirt, mud, and rain. They are at first on each other throat, fighting against each other, but for them to survive. They are forced to put their issues away. This is where the characters try to relied on each other. After camping out and hearing out each other stories, the mood between them soften. They are help on the way by supporting characters such as Big Sam (Lon Chaney Jr.). Lou Chaney Jr, the Hungarian actor is wonderful in the role, as he able to sport the Southern accent as well, able to play somebody that isn't trying to be sinister. Too bad, he doesn't have much screen time or much to bring to the story. Another character they met on the way is the lonely, love-hungry widow played by Cara Williams, who offers to turn in Cullen if Joker will stay with her. Cara Williams is so love struck by Tony Curtis's character, that it's seems out of the blue for her to help one stranger after one day spent with each other, but Cara Williams does a great act as a desperate woman looking for escape by any means even trying to hook up with a inmate. She can be pity and hatred when view. By the time the two men are within hailing distance of a train that might take them to freedom, they have become friends somehow. Despite its pedigree &#x97; the film lacks screen time to explain more how the two main characters' antagonism will boil over and then cool into a forged friendship based on altruism and shared sacrifice. It's running time is only 97 minutes. Way too little for this character is suddenly become cool with each other. The whole film is way too short and focus on too long on cut aways with Sheriff Max Muller. (Theodore Meir Bikel) who was also nominated for the role, just doesn't give anything new to it. I also would love to hear some music score. The film lacks any music to give the movie any suspense, feeling or drama. It felt too good of a movie, not to have a film score. The ending will a downer, but it's works for the story. One of the biggest complains in the film is that some critics stated out that Sidney's character is a 'Magical Negro'. I don't see that at all, as Joker first come in the aid to Cullen when Cullen is stuck in the swamp, as well as having back story. Nor does Sidney character gives anything special insight to change Joker. It was the outside world and the supporting characters that change Joker. The scene where Sidney Poitier comforts Tony Curtis by holding his head in his arms is not made to look like Poitier's character was a servant to the the white man, at all. He did that to comfort his friend. The movie shows that Black or white we are all equal before the harshness of life. The movie is a good movie for teaching civil rights and racial tolerance. I think the theme of racism better and even more obvious in the foreground to make time this was filmed deliberately black-and-white. The movie is pretty gutsy for its era. It's a good watch, so check it out. ","genre":null},{"date":"10 January 2013","score":"","review":" I was defiant to watch this movie by Stanley Kramer.

Dead Aim (1987), Whispers in the Dark (1992), Blink (1994), and Copycat (1995) are several that come to mind. The movie may be broken down into three parts (1) the mystery build-up, (2) the romance, and (3) the recovery (back to the thriller). Andy Garcia stars as LAPD cop John Berlin who relocates to an old farmhouse in Eureka, CA to flee his cheating ex-wife and to lick his wounds. Fred Ross (Lance Henriksen) is Berlin's partner and brother-in-law. On his police radio, Berlin learns that the local cops are at a dump examining the body of a derelict. He arrives and soon the police discover a severed human hand and a bra with dried blood; later they deduce that the fingers were severely scratched because the person was a young blind woman who had used Braille. Learning of seven unsolved cases involving murdered blind women dating back to 1985 that drained police resources to no conclusion, Berlin becomes convinced that the deaths are all related. He wants to reopen the old cases. Of course, no one in the PD believes him. Berlin and Ross drive to the blind people's institute to interview the roommate of Amber, one of the missing women. The roommate is cello teacher Helena Robertson (Uma Thurman), who earlier had been in the dormitory room briefly with the bad guy (called John) while he moved out with Amber. Helene remembers just a few details, like the sound of the car engine. Berlin comes to believe that Helena is Jennifer 8, the eighth (intended) victim nicknamed Jennifer. Helena resembles Berlin's former spouse. In this second phase, angry dark-eyed Berlin and soft blue-eyed Helena eventually fall in love.Berlin wants to go back to the dump, but Ross says to him, No way. I'm not going back. You might find someone's p---- in a hot dog roll. But go they do, and find a clue. But police chief Citrine (Kevin Conway) and others are adamant to close out the case because the evidence is so scanty. Of course you know that Berlin, like a pit bull, will not let go. There will be other trips to the institute, and the situation will be even spookier for Helena, as most folks would have departed the grounds to spend the Christmas holidays at the residences of their families. Even when she stays at the farmhouse, the atmosphere is eerie. Then, on a snowy and fateful Christmas Eve at the institute, a main character is bumped off, and suspicion falls entirely on Berlin. Enter FBI agent St. Anne (John Malkovitch) &#x96; smug, unyielding, insufferable, but effective. What a scene-stealer! Chomp! Chomp! Then again, you know that Berlin will clear his name in the end.There are lapses in credibility, like Berlin's release while charged with a capital offense (murder one!), his odd motive to rummage through an Oakland house, and even his atypical second arrest. Minor plot holes or some crude editing do not really detract from the movie, because we can visualize that such and such happened although it was not shown. The climax, appropriately creepy, is somewhat turgid. Although some have questioned Uma Thurman's interpretation of a blind woman, the acting is commendable. Michael O'Neill as cop Angelo Serato, seems miscast. Does he really look like an Angelo? Then again, that is just a tertiary role. A big plus for Jennifer 8 is the on-location wintry shooting, for Eureka is cold, dreary, and darkly atmospheric. The ominous background music adds to the eeriness. But, with some better editing and a better ending, the movie could have been even greater. So is it worth seeing? Of course!

The roommate is cello teacher Helena Robertson (Uma Thurman), who earlier had been in the dormitory room briefly with the bad guy (called John) while he moved out with Amber. Helene remembers just a few details, like the sound of the car engine. Berlin comes to believe that Helena is Jennifer 8, the eighth (intended) victim nicknamed Jennifer. Helena resembles Berlin's former spouse. In this second phase, angry dark-eyed Berlin and soft blue-eyed Helena eventually fall in love.Berlin wants to go back to the dump, but Ross says to him, No way. I'm not going back. You might find someone's p---- in a hot dog roll. But go they do, and find a clue. But police chief Citrine (Kevin Conway) and others are adamant to close out the case because the evidence is so scanty. Of course you know that Berlin, like a pit bull, will not let go. There will be other trips to the institute, and the situation will be even spookier for Helena, as most folks would have departed the grounds to spend the Christmas holidays at the residences of their families. Even when she stays at the farmhouse, the atmosphere is eerie. Then, on a snowy and fateful Christmas Eve at the institute, a main character is bumped off, and suspicion falls entirely on Berlin. Enter FBI agent St. Anne (John Malkovitch) &#x96; smug, unyielding, insufferable, but effective. What a scene-stealer! Chomp! Chomp! Then again, you know that Berlin will clear his name in the end.There are lapses in credibility, like Berlin's release while charged with a capital offense (murder one!), his odd motive to rummage through an Oakland house, and even his atypical second arrest. Minor plot holes or some crude editing do not really detract from the movie, because we can visualize that such and such happened although it was not shown. The climax, appropriately creepy, is somewhat turgid. Although some have questioned Uma Thurman's interpretation of a blind woman, the acting is commendable. Michael O'Neill as cop Angelo Serato, seems miscast. Does he really look like an Angelo? Then again, that is just a tertiary role. A big plus for Jennifer 8 is the on-location wintry shooting, for Eureka is cold, dreary, and darkly atmospheric. The ominous background music adds to the eeriness. But, with some better editing and a better ending, the movie could have been even greater. So is it worth seeing? Of course!

When Pryor's bookie is murdered inside Wilder's Manhattan convenience store (while his back is turned and Pryor hears the gunshots), it is obvious that they will end up being accused, and the absence of their different senses draws them together as they must support each other and communicate only through Wilder's ability to read lips and Pryor's ability to hear. A combination of both a Road movie and Mel Brook's High Anxiety (already a spoof itself, of Hitchcock films), this utilizes much tactless humor to give us the adventure which leads up to the obvious conclusion. While High Anxiety took Brooks and Madeline Kahn all over San Francisco, this film gives us a look at late 80's Manhattan, from the very lower east side, an obvious under construction West Side Highway and ultimately somewhere in New Jersey. The chase seen is to this film what San Francisco was to Bullitt, and it never lets you look away. Pryor and Wilder don't have the good material here that they had in Silver Streak and Semi-Tough, but unless you are too politically correct to enjoy a good laugh at the expense of the handicapped, you will find yourself embarrassed by laughing. Wilder's character, in particular, is an angry deaf man, and the initial meeting between him and Pryor (plus a later fight between the two of them and a bully in a bar) are truly angry in the way they deliver their humor. Kevin Spacey is one of the villains.

Once again, Freddy is back as a comedic clown rather than a genuinely terrifying menace and by this stage it's hard to remember when he was an imposing villain.The script is vapid and unoriginal, taking elements that worked successfully in previous films and merely reworking them for this one. The death scenes are fairly dull and unmemorable and despite some creativity in the bizarre nightmare scenes, as a whole it just doesn't hold together.

On a rewatch, however, I noticed a lot of flaws pertaining to this B-movie slasher flick that cannot be ignored. But before I get to all that, there is a lot to admire about the film the foreboding atmosphere, Leatherface's first appearance which is shocking and memorable, the Grandpa character, and it's competently made by a filmmaker who knows what he's doing.However, there are some downright frustrating things about the film, the main one being the characters. Unfortunately, the most sympathetic\/least annoying characters are killed off first. And then there's Frankie. Oh, Frankie, Frankie, Frankie. I don't know how I could stand him the first time around, but he is such an annoying character, despite him being in a wheelchair. The scene with him refusing to give his sister Sally the flashlight makes me want to punch a kitten in the face, but that's just one of many occasions where I wanted him to die, and, fortunately, he does. Next, there's Sally. She makes the second half of the film almost unbearable to watch. Her constant screaming is an assault to the senses. It may very well rival Michael Bay's action scenes in any of the Transformer films in giving you a headache. Seriously, apart from flailing around uselessly, that's all she does in the entire film. As opposed to Laurie in Halloween, she makes one hell of an incompetent heroine.Furthermore, there isn't much of a plot here. It's pretty uneventful when compared to the 2003 remake. The film doesn't give any chances for the victims to fight back, and they die too easily which I guess is the point to show Leatherface as a big, unstoppable monster or whatever. Where's the fun in that when there's no even playing field though? But maybe this isn't supposed to be a fun, entertaining film. If the filmmakers' job was to scare people, TCM only does so on occasion. Again, having actress Marilyn Burns screaming is more aggravating than scary, and you have villains (the father and brother) who are just as annoying. Overall, TCM has a lot of potential in being a great horror film, but falls short mainly due to its characters.
