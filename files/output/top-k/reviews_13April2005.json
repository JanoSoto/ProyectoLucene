[{"date":"13 April 2005","score":"","review":" As a big fan of poker, I was very excited to see Rounders, which is a movie about poker. My excitement increased in the first few minutes when it turned out that the main game in this film is no limit Texas Hold'Em; very much my game. One thing that disappointed me with The Cincinnati Kid was that the central game was 5-card stud, and while stud isn't a bad interpretation of poker; it loses hands down to Texas Hold'Em, a game that Rounders rightly professes to be the only pure style of poker. Poker is the main focus of the movie, but obviously that isn't enough to carry a whole film so there's a story behind all the gambling. Matt Damon is a poker whizz kid who finds himself in trouble after blowing his bankroll to a Russian guy (John Malkovich in a fine campy turn). The trouble increases when Damon's friend 'Worm' (Ed Norton) gets out of jail and lands the pair of them in huge debt. Then there's his girlfriend that doesn't like him playing poker and on the whole things just aren't going right for our protagonist.The film benefits from a troupe of credible actors including the aforementioned John Malkovich, Matt Damon and Ed Norton; but also including the likes of Martin Landau, Famke Janssen and John Turturro. Matt Damon is the lead of the film and does a good job with his role, but he's maybe just a little too pretty to be truly convincing. Don't get me wrong, I like Damon and definitely think he can act; but I think also that gamblers tend to be more convincing when they're a little more rugged than Damon is. The film is definitely at it's best when we're following the poker action, and director John Dahl obviously knows this as a large proportion of the screen time is dedicated to the central game. The film falls down on several counts, however, most notably that it's a little corny and some of the scenes seem overdone, while others are severely under-wrought. The story behind the gambling is interesting enough, but it's a little clichéd and it's one of those films where you just know what's going to happen. Adding to that is the fact that it ends prematurely, and would have been much better if we'd followed Damon's escapades in Las Vegas. Still, this is a very decent movie and fans of poker will find lots to like!

It's not a comedy, though. In fact, it wants to be taken very seriously. I wanted to take it seriously, but I couldn't. I just couldn't. If you watch eXistenZ, you'll know why, and if you don't know why, then you should.First of all, let me be fair and start out by saying that the opening credits sequence is very cool. It may even fool you into thinking that you're watching a decent movie. Appearances by Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jude Law, Willem Dafoe. Music by Howard Shore. Directed by the vaguely familiar name of David Cronenberg. Then the action begins, and you're ready for something cool to happen.But it doesn't. Okay, maybe there are a few scenes that hold your attention and that remind you that you're supposed to be watching a mind-bending thriller, and not a repeat from the first season of Farscape. From the very beginning, the viewer understands that there's nothing hip or stylish about this film at all. Instead, the new technology in the film involves mutated reptile body parts. Sounds funny, right? Oh, it is.The plot of the film involves a newly created virtual reality game that must be injected by some kind of umbilical cord-like mechanism into one's own back. The game cost millions of dollars to make, and the first testing begins, only to interrupted by an attempt to kill the game's creator, who also is at the game's first testing. The plot to kill the creator goes awry, a technician becomes the creator's protector, and the pair must enter the game to save the creator's disabled pod, a mechanism through which one enters the game. In other words, there is no plot. Then, after a short (thankfully) 90-some minutes, the film ends, and the ending tries to cover up any holes left in the plot.The acting is poor from the first scene to the last, with only a few scenes where any talent is displayed whatsoever. The talent is mostly provided by Jude Law, but his acting inexperience is obvious. Reactions seem forced, and every scene is either under-acted or over-acted with hardly anything in between. The screenplay is on the same level. There are formulaic lines like, trust no one, corny lines like, I like your script, and downright horrible lines like that's my pink phone. Add then some demented sexual double entendres, bad accents, and characters with no depth, and you have the essence of eXistenZ.As for those who would defend such a film, they would perhaps look at the concept of the thin line between virtual reality and reality, and would hold up Cronenberg's statement regarding the consequences of blurring that line. These things are interesting to me as well, but if only they could've been examined with more intelligence and finesse.It is quite funny, though, and if you're able to take science fiction TV shows seriously, then try this one on for size.Final Grade D.

OK, its by no means a classic and not flawless, but how many movies are? Huge amounts of unfair pressure were put on George Lucas' shoulders when he decided to make this and episode's II and III, which bither way I think was a good idea as we learn about the unknown stories of the Star Wars Saga.I am only 16 and only just before this movie was released back in 1999 did I start to take an interest in Star Wars. Of course, my brothers and I had always had the toys since we were young like everyone else did and still do, but it never really interested when I was that age for some reason. When I saw this movie it the cinemas I was certainly blown away by it despite not understanding it at all. I was there just to see the action scenes of course like all other young kids. It was that kind of movie you had to see regardless of whether you knew what on earth it was about. It had to be seen purely because it was a Star Wars movie. I recently found out that unsurprisingly that for 20 years fans had been going on and on about it and how they thought it would be the best movie ever made. Well people when you have expectations that high then they'll almost never be matched. Many were disappointed because there wasn't enough action. Come on, there was a lot of action in here and no more than was required really considering the plot and the development of the story. Wait till Episode III if you want all action and darkness.Anyway, back to the movie. I watched this again recently for the first time in ages with full understanding of the events that would later happen.It looks great for a start. The locations are stunning, especially the new planets of COurescant and Naboo. The effects are still breathtaking and the costumes and props all look great. The acting is more than exceptional from Liam Neeson, Ewan Mcgregor and surprisingly from young Jake Lloyd who is not annoying to listen to at all. Samuel L Jackson is also a welcome entry to the series as well along with other Jedi's. Jar Jar Binks is, but only to a limit. Most fans thought he completely wrecked the movie, although the kids loved him, like I did when I saw this when I was 10. 6 years on, true I do find him quite annoying for most of the time but he is still a funny character in some scenes such as the gungan battle with the droids at the end. I must say I did find Natalie Portman a little annoying with scenes portraying her as Queen Amidala, not Padme. Her voice is so dull and wooden I just wanted her to cheer up! But when she is not wearing all the make-up and playing Padme she is very good and more fun and interesting to watch.It is maybe a little too long and does drag at some parts, especially during the political scenes and discussions midway through the film, which I found slightly complex and rather boring, but the ending battles certainly make up for it and overall George Lucas had done a good job of introducing us to an relatively unknown story and setting us up for future story we know well.

George let's his business fall, by allowing over due bills to pile up & begins waking up at 315 a.m. the same time the murders of the family that lived there a year prior occurred, he spends most of his days sharpening his Ax & cutting wood, while seemingly getting sicker & more worn down & very moody & darker as time goes on, black ooze emanates from the toilets, the walls & staircases bleed, doors are ripped off their hinges, windows explode, chandeliers move by themselves, chairs movie by themselves, haunting glowing eyes from a demonic pig, that stares at Kathy through a window sill at night, strangers appearing at their door & then disappearing, missing money, one of the kids has a window pane mysteriously & violently, slammed on his fingers, flies showing up when their not in season, the phones malfunction & goes static when others try to warn the family of the dangers they are in, a priest's car malfunctions on the highway when they set out to warn the family & almost winds up killing them, the youngest daughter's window keeps opening after it's been shut by the parents, the house is almost unbearably cold at times, despite being well insulated, the family dog constantly scratching at a basement wall until it's paws bleed, trying to get behind it, crosses are turned upside down, etc. The house is trying to get George to repeat the grisly happenings that occurred there a year prior, only this time in an even more heinous fashion.THE AMITYVILLE HORROR is a pretty entertaining horror film, released during the supernatural horror craze that gripped the horror film industry in the 1970's. The film's opening briefly shows the aftermath that occurred on November 13th 1974 & then re-visits that horrible night in brief flashbacks, when the Lutz explore the house with a Realtor. The film boasts some pretty good effective chills however, a shrieking cat leaps into frame, chairs that move by themselves, freakish pig monsters that stare through windows & LALO SCHIFRIN'S score (He also provided a truly wonderful one for THE EXORCIST) is pretty haunting with a child like melody that plays over the proceedings. But let's talk about that house! not only is it super creepy looking, but it's ominous presence could so easily be classified as a horror icon itself! The film itself in truth really isn't a film, more or less a documentary recounting the events that occurred there & bears an almost made for TV movie feel to it. Director STUART ROSENBERG manages to deliver several cool shots & despite it's over length, always manages to make the film creepy & always has something going on to keep you hooked. The acting is really good here & We get a pretty chilling background on the history of the land the house was built on & a possible reason behind the supernatural occurrences & the fact that the house might possibly be situated on a well, that is actually a portal to enter hell itself.On the downside however the film tends to overstay it's welcome, clocking in at the two hour mark! & to be truthful, the film has no real story structure to it, it merely is just scene after scene of oddball supernatural occurrences & since it's based on a true story, anyone who knows of it, knows that all the Lutz family members made it out alive, which immediately kills off any type of suspense, tension, terror & momentum that the film might have had, as it regards a possible horrible fate that might befall the family members & the film admittedly gets a bit hokey, a little corny at times.All in all, I highly recommend this movie, I really enjoyed it & is one of the best horror films to emerge from the 1970's era. What should be noted is how the name Amityville is the name of a real town on Long Island New York, as a result the name cannot be copyrighted, which is why practically every film studio in town & their producers later hitched their waggon's to this hit, by dropping the word Horror out of the title & just calling them Amityville movies so they would not have to pay author Jay Anson every time they wanted to make a sequel (all the sequels had very little to do with the actual happenings anyways) A box office smash, despite the fact that the Lutz account of supernatural events that plagued them & their children was later found out to be a hoax, (revealed after a series of appearances on the talk show circuits that helped make their story a sensation) that did not stop Hollywood from remaking the film in 2005 & Following it up with various documentaries & a whole lot of sequels (nine thus far!) & one prequel AMITYVILLE II THE POSSESSION***1\/2 stars ","genre":null},{"date":"13 April 2005","score":"","review":" Based on JAY ANSON'S allegedly true best seller of the same name that he penned & published in 1977, a recently married couple George & Kathy Lutz buy a rather large house on 112 Ocean Avenue, at an enormously cheap price & movie into it with their children, however what at first appears to be their dream home quickly turns into a nightmare, as they spend twenty eight days straight dealing with unexplained noises which emanate from the basement, their young daughter has an Imaginary friend named Jody who tells her about the horrible murders that occurred there a year prior, the babysitter the Lutz hire to watch over the kids is mysteriously locked in a closet (with no lock on the door!) a priest who comes to bless the house is attacked by swarms of flies & is later blinded, Kathy's aunt (a nun) gets violently ill (can you guess the spirits in this house hate people of the cloth?)

I remember my colleagues in school discussing the imminent nuclear destruction of the world on August 29th, 1997 (Judgement Day as described in Terminator 2) and going home bitterly disappointed after physics. Still, I always went home disappointed after physics... Anyway, those of you waiting for Los Angeles to crumble into a sky scraping broken industrial wasteland a la Blade Runner might want to take a gander at this - a straight-forward sci-fi actioner but with a bit more underneath the surface.Demolition Man welcomes us to L.A. in 1996, a place where law and order has disintegrated to such an extent that the Hollywood sign is on fire. Cue beret-wearing super cop John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone) who ends his two-year hunt for professional psycho Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes) by blowing up a building full of hostages, as is his way. Now here's the clever part - both Phoenix and Spartan are sentenced to be cryogenically frozen (what?!?) and rehabilitated in their icy prison but sadly, Phoenix escapes. And the future is not really ready for someone like Phoenix - it is a peaceful utopia, full of quirky inventions and pacifist police officers like Lt. Lenina Huxley (Sandra Bullock). But it soon becomes apparent that the only man who can stop Phoenix's new reign of terror is the maniac sent to catch him before - Spartan.Even at the time of release, this was looking pretty dated. Stallone, in all the films he's made, only really acts in one and that's Copland. Here, he goes through the motions as a foul-mouthed, meat-headed caveman (not really a stretch, is it?) in a world that understand him about as much as he understands it. And the story is terribly old-hat - cryogenics proved little more than an expensive fad (I even recall the subject appearing in an episode of Star Trek TNG) and to see it here in all it's neo-modern glory raises a faint smile. Something which most viewers now may find happening quite a lot. Brainless and formulaic it may be but Demolition Man is an unusually comic action film with no shame at all. It revels in being futuristically old-fashioned (how's that for an oxymoron?) but has one or two ideas up its sleeve. A good amount of time is spent away from the carnage as Spartan acquaints himself on our behalf in the future and this is time well spent. The fashions have that Gene Roddenberry feel to them but a lot of effort is spent on making this future society as believable as possible and that counts for something.Acting is mixed as only Stallone and Bullock have any real screen time. Snipes hams it up as the baddie but everybody else isn't taking it seriously at all - another good point as to do so with this film is sheer folly. This is for the popcorn-munching masses at the multiplex, a switch-your-brain-off actioner with all the grace and finesse of a brick being thrown through your car windscreen. The explosions are big, the dialogue is a little clunky, the action is satisfying. It does exactly what it says on the tin and if you're looking for anything deeper than forget it because it's not here. The quest to find a good movie with Bullock in continues but this isn't half bad, not as good as Speed (still her best) but it passes the time well enough. With a pinch of salt anyway.

When nothing else can be said or when too much has already been said, words can be considered dead. One thing this makes me think of are sorrys or apologies. Sometimes apologies are in a sense overdone and the words become gibberish or dead. This is also much like why is writing (s)welles.

I'm assuming it was possibly to make it seem more realistic. Anyway, her hair made shapes. Every few seconds it would change and different geometric shapes would appear. I know this does not seem too important, but maybe there is meaning behind it.2.Other counselor (male) talking about evolution of individuals while he himself is changing&#133; Then, the other counselor was talking about evolution of individuals to the main character.

Perhaps the main character of Walking Life is trying to find destiny by dreaming&#133; dream is destiny! 2.Crayons- it's what you do with the colors This saying is so true! It is not really how you use the crayon, but how you express yourself by the colors. I think this applies to the movie. The colors in this case are all of the little motions and expressive animation (both drawn and spoken).3.Your life is for you to create &#150;professor Obviously&#133; This seems almost ridiculous in a way, but so many people seem to lead their lives in other's footsteps or in the wants of others. This ties in with the previous fragment about the crayons and the color. One creates their life by using their own colors and no one else's.4.&#133;words are dead&#133; &#150;counselor (female) At times words are dead. When nothing else can be said or when too much has already been said, words can be considered dead. One thing this makes me think of are sorrys or apologies. Sometimes apologies are in a sense overdone and the words become gibberish or dead. This is also much like why is writing (s)welles. Once one has gone on and on about a certain topic ((s)welle), the words begin to die and the reader eventually dies off too (is not interested).5.&#133;man needs chaos... &#150;friend Without chaos, the world would be a great place. But without one thing, in this case that occurs almost everyday, everything could change. Chaos is a normal state. Confusion is normal. I think many things would never get done if it was not for chaos. Oh yeah, I definitely did not like the fire!6.Reincarnation\/collective memory- couple in bed I was not too sure where this conversation was going, but it seemed interesting. I noticed myself trying to understand what these two were talking about. Their thoughts were intriguing. I think this may have been where we stopped watching it. We should watch the rest! ----- There were a couple parts of the animation where I noticed the character's looks changed, but was not sure of the reasoning&#133;1.The counselor's hair makes shapes while she talks&#133; While the woman counselor was talking, here hair would move certain ways. I'm assuming it was possibly to make it seem more realistic. Anyway, her hair made shapes. Every few seconds it would change and different geometric shapes would appear. I know this does not seem too important, but maybe there is meaning behind it.2.Other counselor (male) talking about evolution of individuals while he himself is changing&#133; Then, the other counselor was talking about evolution of individuals to the main character. I though it was a bit funny because he was changing; he was developing different characteristics. Development is much like evolution. I thought this could have been a form of symbolism. To tell you the truth though, I was too busy watching his head expand and then shrink&#133;I really did not pay much attention to what he said; other than it was about evolution of individuals.

The only ones who seemingly knows what is going on is Jacob's rebellious son Rusty (Damon Martin) who befriends a local neighbourhood woman (Nita Talbot) who knows that this clock is bad news (so does the neighbourhood dog who refuses to go into the home) as she sees in a vision while looking at the house the clock is installed in, the Long Island house of terror. Investigating it's past the two discover that the clock belonged to a satanist called Gilles de Rais, a fifteenth century boys school teacher, town preacher, necromancer, inventor & satanist who took only the smartest boys & killed them, believing he would gain immortality & youth from devouring their flesh.

But can the evil be stopped or is it to late?The best thing that could be said about AMITYVILLE 1992 IT'S ABOUT TIME is the fact that it's far & away much better than the mediocre fifth film & actually, despite being another completely unnecessary sequel is much better than many of the sequels that came after the original film. The film for the most part is reasonably well acted & certainly well directed by TONY RANDALL who manages to conjure up many creepy images, interesting themes & manages to keep the story on par for pretty much the entire movie. The special effects are pretty decent as well, such as Megan Ward's boyfriend falling into a puddle full of hot black slime & melting down into a puddle of human flesh. To be truthful if they would have called this movie something else & removed an image of the Amityville house they still would have had a movie since there's barely anything here to connect this film to any of the previous entries. It continues on with a possessed object plot line used in four (& which would be used in the next two sequels) not surprising since the very people who made Part 4, also made this one as well, in fact if you look at the old box art, you'll see in the upper window of the house the lamp from that movie peering down. AMITYVILLE 1992 IT'S ABOUT TIME also has other points of interest, namely in the area of cast & crew as genre fans will appreciate the many familiar faces both in front & behind the camera including MEGAN WARD (JOE'S APARTMENT) DAMON MARTIN (GHOULIES II) STEPHEN MACHT (THE MONSTER SQUAD) SHAWN WEATHERLY (POLICE ACADEMY 3) NITA TALBOT (PUPPET MASTER 2) Director TONY RANDALL (HELLBOUND HELLRAISER II) & producer STEVE WHITE (AMITYVILLE HORROR PART 4 THE EVIL ESCAPES) with special effects by K.N.B.

There is no drama in John Nash's disease. All of it seems like a normal life but with a few extra people appearing to the main hero that nobody else seem to notice. The depiction of drama that followed is very sketchy at best with several decades of his life compressed into just a few minutes. The movie seems to suggest that the Nobel Prize is a sufficient reward for all of Prof. Nash's suffering. I personally would not trade 30 or more years of my life for any prize.

Both movies take silly thriller material and make something poetic out of it. Psycho is essentially a black joke; The Dead Zone is a love story.That's what I take from it every time I see it. It's a movie about a high school teacher named Johnny Smith (Christopher Walken) who emerges from a coma after five years with psychic powers. He later crosses paths with a serial killer, still later a megalomaniac capable of blowing up half the world. And yet this is a movie about people, and it's a love story.How did they do it? In the first reel, with just a few deft touches, this movie establishes that Johnny and Sarah Bracknell (Brooke Adams) love each other. And we really feel it. Is it the dialogue, the performances, the music? Is it the way it's shot and edited? It's all these things, I guess. There's a scene where Johnny and Sarah stand at her doorway. It's pouring rain. She invites him to stay the night, but he says, Better not. And later, Some things are worth the wait. Why such diffidence? We figure out later that it may be his strict religious upbringing. But the movie never says so explicitly.Many things in the film are implied. This fosters the illusion that the people and events exist somewhere outside the confines of the frame. Does Johnny have latent psychic abilities before the car accident? Well, he has a weird headache while riding a roller coaster with Sarah. Is he predicting what's about to happen to him on the road? Probably, but the movie never hammers the point.Is Johnny's mother latently psychic, too? The movie makes a couple of very tiny suggestions to this effect. She feels his pain very strongly in one scene; in another she's either having an hallucination or a psychic vision when she sees Johnny in the hospital room not as he is now but in the house, wearing boots and tracking in snow.Walken's performance is so important to this movie. He's a quirky actor, as we all know. Here all his choices are unpredictable, yet invariably and uncannily right. And despite his creepy persona, he's enormously sympathetic. He's an ordinary man in an extraordinary situation; we believe it and feel strongly for him. (After discovering this movie, it will be hard for me to watch him again in later movies, caricaturing himself.)Brooke Adams is an appealing actress with an enormous smile. Most importantly, she, as Sarah, convincingly loves Johnny. She runs out into the rain just to grab Johnny and say, I'm so crazy about you. The music swells, and it's all so terribly corny, except &#x85; it isn't. It's a lovely moment, and we believe it.David Cronenberg, who directs, wrings deft performances from all his actors &#x96; from the major supporting players like Herbert Lom, who plays Johnny's doctor, and the low-key Tom Skerritt, who plays a sheriff &#x96; to the tiny cameos. There's the nurse with the saucer eyes whose daughter is in unexpected danger. There's the physical therapist who encourages Johnny to chug chug. There's the great Colleen Dewhurst playing the small role of an evil mother. There's Sean Sullivan and Jackie Burroughs playing Johnny's parents; he is naturalistic, she stylized, an odd but oddly appropriate pairing. I wish I had the space to keep going.The one character and performance I don't like is Martin Sheen's Greg Stillson. He seems like a caricature created by someone inordinately frightened of evangelism, the kind of person who quakes in his boots every time a Reagan or a Bush mentions God. Nevertheless, his effect on Johnny and the plot are important. And caricature or not, his fate proves to be very satisfying; and it paves the way for the ending, which is rightly about Johnny and Sarah.Cronenberg handles suspense so deftly, it's inspiring how good he is. I'll just point out two things. One is the device of the handshakes &#x96; sometimes one will cause a vision, sometimes not. Cronenberg and his scenarist, Jeffrey Boam, wisely fill the movie with plenty of handshakes, always keeping us on edge, wondering, Is it going to happen this time, is it, is it? Two is the scene when we don't know if a certain character is still alive or dead. The camera pulls back from that character's father, and we look around the room for him. Where is he? Is he alive? We're in agony. Hitchcock could not have handled it better.As in Psycho, the music score is essential. It's impossible to imagine either movie without it. Michael Kamen's score is alternately mournful, romantic, creepy. He adds special excitement to the vision sequences, and gives each one its own particular quality. For the gazebo murder, for instance, it somehow sounds as if the music is going backwards.Nothing replaces or supersedes Hitchcock's nightmarish masterpiece. But this movie, for all its sadness, horror and tragedy, has a less cynical nature. It's about love and doing the right thing.

Two highly-acclaimed recent Eastwood films -- Mystic River and Million-Dollar Baby -- mildly disappointed me by sinking into oversimplification and predictability. Possibly Eastwood's directing hand is more interesting when less self-assured, because 1997's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil follows these questions down less well-defined, and thus less predictable, paths. Maintaining a scrupulously neutral eye, the film recounts a complex tale of murder, involving characters who are recognizable types on the surface but carry deep difference underneath. It unfurls a slow, rich, and troubling narrative which answers the mysteries of its crime premise even as it opens much more difficult questions about the very things that murder stories are supposed to make simple innocence, guilt, motivations, affection, and its characters' so-called morality.Thanks in large part to a literally mesmerizing performance by Kevin Spacey (I'm riveted every time he appears on screen) and a well- balanced turn by John Cusack as the sympathetic investigating reporter, who charms us even as he maintains a total and focused receptivity to new information and strange events, the movie fills its two and a half hours with a slow-paced and carefully balanced story that brings us into the suffocating green world of Southern Gothic, with its all its mannered refinements, thick silences and passionate secrets. There's something in this film that would have pleased Tennessee Williams or Truman Capote, those cool-eyed investigators of the closeted South. John Berendt's nuanced book, Spacey's restrained, smoldering performance and Eastwood's lucidly hands-off direction have created a strange, slow gem of a film. It's not a gem appreciated by everyone, but two years before Spacey's turn in American Beauty struck a chord that resonated with the wider public, Midnight in the Garden asks similar questions in a context that is, at the same time, more precise, more exotic, and equally American.

Although we didn't get to see all of it, a lot happened in the short 20-25 minutes that we did get to watch. First thing that really attracted me to this movie was the animation. Animated characters are always a good way to make people pay attention to the message that is being displayed along with simply being entertaining. However these different characters were so real that is seemed as if it were cartoons coming to life with real problems and ideology. My favorite part of the movie which is the same part that stuck out in my head the most is the part where a three guys were riding in the car and the driver goes on and on talking about random but meaningful things and then he says this phrase which really caught my attention. The phrase went something like, I doesn't matter if you have a 8- count or 16- count of crayons, what matters is what you do with the colors. This statement is so true because it pertains to almost everything in life, in all that you do, wherever you are. So many people are interested in the quantity of things when it is the quality that counts. Like those who write papers for their classes and think that the teachers are interested in some long drawn out paper or answer.

Although we didn't get to see all of it, a lot happened in the short 20-25 minutes that we did get to watch. First thing that really attracted me to this movie was the animation. Animated characters are always a good way to make people pay attention to the message that is being displayed along with simply being entertaining. However these different characters were so real that is seemed as if it were cartoons coming to life with real problems and ideology. My favorite part of the movie which is the same part that stuck out in my head the most is the part where a three guys were riding in the car and the driver goes on and on talking about random but meaningful things and then he says this phrase which really caught my attention. The phrase went something like, I doesn't matter if you have a 8- count or 16- count of crayons, what matters is what you do with the colors. This statement is so true because it pertains to almost everything in life, in all that you do, wherever you are. So many people are interested in the quantity of things when it is the quality that counts.

A Nightmare On Elm Street, spawner of sequels, influencer of crap is the movie horror fans hoped for in the early eighties, but is also an effective satire on small town life, our fascination with serial killers, our fear of the unknown, and the sins of our forefathers.Nancy is a 14 year old. She has a cute boyfriend who would do anything for her, and two friends who mock them by being...experienced. Nancy lives with her alcoholic mother in a large house, her father is the local Sheriff, they divorced a while ago. One night when the four friends are staying together, Tina is brutally murdered by a hideously disfigured man, seemingly in her dreams. Her boyfriend watches on, horrified, while Nancy hears the screams from outside. Rod flees, and the cops look for him believing he is the only possible killer. However, once caught Nancy becomes convinced that someone else killed Tina, a man named Fred Krueger. Later Rod dies in his cell, it is believed to be suicide but Nancy knows differently. Her mother becomes increasingly estranged, as Nancy does all she can to stay awake, knowing that if she sleeps she may die. Her mother takes her to psychiatrists as she doesn't know what to do, not knowing that everything she is doing is wrong. She goes so far as barring Nancy inside the house, and she can't see Glen her boyfriend. Nancy believes Glen is next. Upon investigation Nancy finds out Krueger's story- he was a child murderer who stalked the town a few years ago. He was caught but escaped unpunished by some loophole, so the residents took the law into their own hands, burning and killing Fred. However, now he is back for revenge by killing the children of Elm Street once again in their dreams, where they should be safe. Nancy thinks that she can bring Fred into the real world and stop him, but needs Glen to stay awake. However, Glen's parents think she is a maniac and take the phone off the hook. Glen is killed and his parents are clueless. It is up to Nancy to stop Krueger, hoping her father will be ready when she screams for him. So she lets herself sleep, and looks for Fred.This is one of the most imaginative horror movies ever, blending dreams with reality so the viewer never knows whether a character is asleep or not, giving a sense of tension throughout. Craven uses all the force which caused his previous films to be censored and banned, but makes his themes more subtle, and substitutes the realistic and grim visuals of The Last House on the Left for the fantastical sights here. For the most part it is the fault of the parents that their kids are killed- they created the monster by trying to kill the monster, but more importantly they then feel like their job has been completed, not realising when their kids are in danger. There is a total lack of understanding between the two generations, and little trust in the abilities of the youth. It is not only a tale for those reaching adulthood to be afraid of the world, that in the end we have to rely on ourselves rather than those who have protected us, but it is a story about the older generation's fear of the next generation. They want to be leaders but have their own insecurities, they want to be respected but show little in return, they want to protect but cannot see when something is really wrong.The young cast is good, particularly Langenkamp. Garcia and Wyss have little to do, Depp has a bigger role and shows some of what would make him a legend. It is Langenkamp who carries the film, and she is excellent in her portrayal of fear, paranoia and helplessness, all the things we face when we are teens. We forget though that these things rarely leave us. She screams, but thinks, and is not the typical stupid teen, making an assertive step towards saving herself and her friends, while trying to hold her family together. Indeed she proves to be the strongest character in the film, preceding Ripley by a few years. She knows her survival is down to herself. The older members are also very good. Blakley is brilliant as Marge who cannot cope with Nancy and with her break-up, giving in to booze like so many others. Saxon is also good as the father trying to get on with his life and work, and forget the evils of his past while trying to understand his daughter. And of course, Englund steals every scene he is in. He is terrifyingly believable, the perfect example of what lurks in our nightmares, waking and dreaming. His one-liners are comic to himself as he takes sadistic joy in following and killing kids. In later films they become silly, but here we get the sense that these are the exact words that would come from a paedophile and serial killer.The effects here also standout, with the famous bloodbath bed scene and Tina being torn all over the ceiling becoming some of the most famous images in horror history. Kreuger looks scary, those blades will be heard in our dreams, and the dream world is filmed with care so that we can tell that there is something not quite right about the surroundings, unsettling us. A highly effective film, scary and at times funny, but thought-provoking and unnerving with one of the most frightening villains ever committed to film. This inspired many clones, but this is still the king and continues to influence many films, horror and beyond. And count the number of Simpsons references.10 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 April 2005","score":"","review":" In 1984 Wes Craven redefined the horror movie forever, bringing his own rules to the game, avoiding the clichés that had gone before, making an exciting, inventive, gory, wickedly clever, and above all-scary film.

Okay, this could be an appealing combination for many audiences but what really strikes you about Baise Moi is its utter ineptitude and ugliness.Directed by two women; Virginie Despentes and Coralie Trinh Thi (based on ex-prostitute Despente's novel), the film does evoke a substantial feel of female rage and bitterness towards men, although having the two leads kill innocents does leave a nasty taste in the mouth and detracts from the film's message. The director's have tried hard to make a shocking and provocative film here, but the use of hardcore acts merely as a distraction from what is trying to be said. Men will see this film because of the sex, not because of any feminist issues that may arise through the narrative. But maybe that's the whole point of Baise Moi - to feed men's weakness for sex whilst simultaneously castrating them with images of mutilation and death. I'm sure Freud would have had a field day with it, but he probably would have had better things to do.Porn stars Raffaela Anderson and Karen Bach act to the best of their ability, pulling off (excuse the pun) some of the more emotional scenes satisfactorily, but you just can't help thinking that they are just playing at being 'proper' actresses. But it is also this element of amateurism that gives the film a well-needed dose of charm, something it is severely lacking. For all its good intentions and bravery, Baise Moi manages to alienate the viewer with its slap-dash style and repulsive characters whilst also being just brave enough to earn itself a few merit points.With all the controversy that surrounds it, Baise Moi does indeed live up to its shocking nature. There is a close-up penetration shot during the opening rape scene (cut from UK prints), several blow jobs, a gun being inserted in a man's arse and fired and hardcore sex aplenty, but most shocking of all is the fact that a film so poorly made has been merited as such a classic in some quarters. Okay, so it's 'cutting edge' to incorporate sexual penetration into a mainstream film, but Baise Moi is about as mainstream as your holiday videos, and shot on the same format. Stick with Thelma and Louise - if you also want hardcore sex - go and get some, the two don't mix.

This video was unlike anything I have ever seen. Even in the short time I had to view it, my attention was captivated. It has been mentioned by others, especially those who watched it at the same time that I did, that the graphics were very interesting and worthy of paying attention to. I loved how the movie was drawn like a cartoon, but everything seemed so life like. While watching it, one might forget are the events that are happening real or made up? I realize that it is a stretch, but Waking Life reminds me a little of movies like Toy Story. Though the animation technique used was quite different, in both cases everything looked so lifelike and was modeled after real things unlike a cartoon such as the Flintstones. During the movie an idea was brought up that has always been so interesting to me. At one point the characters were discussing how words are just symbols. For example, what do love or frustration really mean? It is so cool to think that no one can really give them a definition. Whenever someone asks what is love? an answer is almost impossible to come up with. It means something so different to each person and, even if we do think we know what love is, finding words to describe it can seem like the hardest thing in the world to do. Questions like this have become even more compelling to me as I have seen them in the real world or learned about them in classes. For example, I have taken Spanish classes since my freshman year of high school. One of the difficulties I have come across in my quest to become bilingual is that certain words or phrases simply do not translate well between two languages. At times it can be frustrating because you want to be able to convey the correct meaning, but usually I think it is more fascinating to see the subtle changes between languages. One example of this that I think of right away is the Spanish phrase buen provecho. When I went to Puerto Rico last year everyone would say this at meal times, but it is hard to explain to someone who only speaks English. I guess it would be close to the French phrase bon appetite but not exactly. Right now is an instance where it is frustrating to not be able to tell you exactly what I mean, but I wish I could because the phrase is so cool. Another time that I have seen this as I have tried to learn Spanish is with songs. Music is something that is full of emotions no matter what language one speaks. Whenever I have tried to explain to someone what the lyrics of a Spanish song mean, it just comes out not sounding as good as it did in its natural state. This is because so much is lost in translation. ","genre":null},{"date":"13 April 2005","score":"","review":" For my English class, we watched the first 20 or so minutes of Waking Life.

I loved how the movie was drawn like a cartoon, but everything seemed so life like. While watching it, one might forget are the events that are happening real or made up? I realize that it is a stretch, but Waking Life reminds me a little of movies like Toy Story. Though the animation technique used was quite different, in both cases everything looked so lifelike and was modeled after real things unlike a cartoon such as the Flintstones. During the movie an idea was brought up that has always been so interesting to me. At one point the characters were discussing how words are just symbols. For example, what do love or frustration really mean? It is so cool to think that no one can really give them a definition. Whenever someone asks what is love? an answer is almost impossible to come up with. It means something so different to each person and, even if we do think we know what love is, finding words to describe it can seem like the hardest thing in the world to do. Questions like this have become even more compelling to me as I have seen them in the real world or learned about them in classes. For example, I have taken Spanish classes since my freshman year of high school. One of the difficulties I have come across in my quest to become bilingual is that certain words or phrases simply do not translate well between two languages. At times it can be frustrating because you want to be able to convey the correct meaning, but usually I think it is more fascinating to see the subtle changes between languages. One example of this that I think of right away is the Spanish phrase buen provecho. When I went to Puerto Rico last year everyone would say this at meal times, but it is hard to explain to someone who only speaks English. I guess it would be close to the French phrase bon appetite but not exactly. Right now is an instance where it is frustrating to not be able to tell you exactly what I mean, but I wish I could because the phrase is so cool. Another time that I have seen this as I have tried to learn Spanish is with songs. Music is something that is full of emotions no matter what language one speaks. Whenever I have tried to explain to someone what the lyrics of a Spanish song mean, it just comes out not sounding as good as it did in its natural state. This is because so much is lost in translation.

The same happens here even though Episode II is way better than Episode I with way more action, even better locations, a stunning digital look due to outstanding special effects and the further development of the Story with a plot which is a lot less complex and more interesting than that in Episode I, probably because its getting closer to things we hear about in Episode IV.For a start, the planets are great, with Coruscant and Tattoine looking better than ever but Naboo looks the best here with amazing views and scenery. New planets Kamino and Geonosis are also breathtaking though as well. This is where the special effects come into their own. The clone Army looks amazing as well, especially in the scene at the end with several thousand of them boarding spaceships and taking off. The action as I've already said exceeds what we saw in Episode I, kicking off with a sensational chase through Coruscant, and following on with other spectacular scenes including a Battle between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jango Fet, a Jedi Vs Droid arena battle,and finally the best fight in the movie and probably the most pulsating witnessed in any Star Wars movie- Yoda Vs. Count Dooku. Although it could've been longer this battle makes the movie worth seeing alone.The acting is both good and average. Ewan Mcgregor really reminds us of Alec Guiness here as the old Obi-Wan Kenobi from Episode's IV, V and VI as he has a much bigger part than he did in Episode I. He delivers one unintentionally hilarious line here when he says I have work to do, whilst being held captive on Geonosis by Dooku. Natatlie Portman is also good as well in her returning role as Padme. People have been mixed on Hayden Christensen. I felt he was a bit too wimpish in most scenes to be honest and spoke as if he's acting in a Shakespeareian play Judging by the way he says lines slowly like Why couldn't I save her, I know I could have. The dialogue in the romantic scenes has been well-documented. I agree, it is a bit cheesy and could've been better had they shortened some of Anakin's lines to Could've instead of could have etc. , but never mind. Moving on, Christopher Lee looks to be savouring his role as Count Dooku and makes a pretty good villain despite not appearing until towards the end.Overall, this is a great Star Wars entry and I really can't wait for Episode III, due out next month. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 April 2005","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" In my review of Episode I, I commented on how badly Lucas had been bashed because of it for a variety of reasons even though I thought it was actually a very good movie.
