If we are to go by the film's proposition, film producers in charge of large companies feed off of others before shamelessly claiming the credit and enjoying the revelling in all the cash that brings in the process. To say the film is a one trick pony would be too harsh-a criticism but it isn't too far from the truth; its above notion regarding producers being as beastly as they are is a relatively interesting one but that is its sole idea, the core of its make up the exploration of this thesis arriving in the form of three separate stories from contrasting perspectives that ultimately might have been shorter; sharper and maybe told parallel to one another to make them more interesting, with the film most probably being as such as a result.We begin with an array of three people in separate places doing separate things receiving incoming calls from a certain movie producer, an actress and a director inform their aides with stern faces to categorically reject the voice on the other end whom wishes to communicate. The third, a writer, is, curiously enough, actually able to bring himself to speak to him down the line, unlike the other two, but again informs him precisely where he stands in really not wanting any further contact with him. That man, the movie producer, is a certain Jon Shields, a character played by Kirk Douglas; a man with a big, broad smile; a homely tone and a glowing face for the non-diegetic camera &#x96; internally, somewhat of a monster, an ugly and raw animal looking out for himself and the money he will earn in the process. The systematic rejection of the individual as a business partner henceforth tells us precisely where each tale is headed when it is we finally flashback for each account, the beginning with director Fred Amiel (Sullivan) before moving onto actress Georgia Lorrison (Turner) and then finishing with that writer named Jim Bartlow (Powell) eventually coming to formulate the heart of a film making the same point three times, but from the perspectives of three wildly differing people with roles within the film industry spanning both genders.In being able to hear each story, the three gather in Jon's office at the Shields production studio; the bevy of industry professionals gathered around one another, in front of an on-listening Shields official, talking drearily of their lifetime experiences echos that of a kind of addicts seminar. The office displays a vast amount of Oscar statuettes, but the official working there is yet to have heard of a Pulitzer Prize; something which alludes to vast degrees of success within a particular field via the awards on show, but hints at a place driven by people living the bubbled nature of their own existence - by those whom are preprogrammed to produce success after success in the film-making world but are oblivious to such accolades at the peak of sister-professions within their creative fields.Amiel's story reveals Jon as a young and enthusiastic go-getter; a man able to churn out B-movies with regularity, such is his enthusiasm, in his partnership with Amiel so as to pay off a debt. Jon appears charming and professional; throughout Amiel's strand, there is a workable sense of ambiguity in regards as to whether Shields is doing what he does out of love for films and their creation or the vast sums of money he so easily earns. Amiel is left stranded when an ambitious project gets off the ground and he is excused from directing it for a more experienced man. Lorrison's plot is more broadly linked to the myth of stardom and the celebrification of one's self through looks and what-not in the tinsel town paradise that is Hollywood; a story more inclined towards being straight up generic romance with tinges of melodrama in what is the weakest of the three but does what it sets out to do in exploring said myth and having everything end tragically. Lastly, Bartlow's tale is one that revolves around little to do with the fatuity of the film business; seeing he and a wife, whom we do not necessarily believe he would be have been married to in the first place, fall foul of Hollywood's grip which disappointingly plays out more under the watchful eye of fate than it does anything else.The film is a broad and ambitious piece, made far more watchable by Kirk Douglas' central performance as the menace Shields; Douglas playing him in a manner that sees him essentially match what it is he does in each of the three stories, an alluding to that greater extent of ruthless professionalism he embodies and that lack of remorse he so clearly has; by the time we've reached Bartlow's tale, he has near enough destroyed two separate lives - but his attitude and demeanour has stayed the same throughout and is all the more chilling because of it. The film was released at around about the time of two other famous Hollywood films about Hollywood itself, namely Sunset Blvd. and Singing in the Rain; it isn't as exciting nor does it arrive with narratives as engaging as either of those examples. Indeed, it isn't involving as something, granted, a lot more contemporary in the form of 1992's The Player; a film about a film producer whom oversteps certain marks and is drawn into danger with a disgruntled industry worker he's dealt with &#x96; three separate films we enjoy somewhat more than The Bad and the Beautiful which has merits, but falls short of anything more.

I named The Boys From Brazil Franklyn Shaffner's exquisitely captivating thriller, starring two of the most beloved and respected actors of Hollywood's Golden Age Gregory Peck and Sir Laurence Olivier. Two classy gentlemen in two roles that couldn't have been more antagonistic Gregory Peck as the evil Dr. Jozef Mengele and Laurence Oliver as Ezra Lieberman, a veteran Nazi Hunter, whose life is dedicated to honor the memory of the Holocaust's victims by chasing and punishing their executioners.And the first surprise that will probably tease your mind in the first part of the film, concerns the acting department. Both Olivier and Peck are amazing and for two different reasons. While Olivier proves again his tremendous versatility by playing a venerable and inspiring Nazi-hunter after having portrayed the evilly iconic Nazi dentist, Dr. Christian Szell two years before in Marathon Man, Gregory Peck surprises us through a role which is a 180 degree turn from good old Atticus Finch... and it's one of these villainous performances that impacts you whether you take them seriously or not. Peck is indeed a delight to watch.But I know I shouldn't use that word because Peck is playing a particularly despicable character, even worse because he really existed. While Szell was based on Mengele, Peck played Mengele. The character is the real-life Nazi doctor whose crimes in concentration camps reached a level of barbarity so atrocious one could wonder how we can decently make a character enjoyable to watch, out of this man. But the cleverness of Heywood Gould's script relies on its approach of this quite difficult subject. The approach is simple the film is a thriller adapted from a Sci-Fi novel, helped by Schaffner's impeccable direction. The whole story is based on an incredible plot device so original, so unexpected that you understand you can't take the movie seriously, and I mean this as a compliment. It's a movie that doesn't pretend to be another thing than a movie, its purpose is to entertain and to thrill us though a complex and puzzling plot whose twist is revealed earlier enough to make the climax more enjoyable. Anyway, at the end, you're satisfied. And believe me, you'll be surprised.And that's what I loved about the film, its unpretentiousness to deal with a difficult subject in a subtle over-the-top but necessary way, because ironically the movie could only work by distancing itself from gravity and seriousness. Don't expect intellectual complexity, or Oscar worthy performances, but you can expect one hell of an entertainment from beginning to end. The movie got some Oscar nods though starting with Laurence Olivier in the lead role -while Peck got a Golden Globe nomination- I concede that both were great but not really Oscar worthy. I guess I'm biased because I would have nominated Brad Davis for Midnight Express instead. The editing was rightfully nominated, and so was Jerry Goldsmith's brilliant score, a well-deserved nomination for a score that perfectly delivers the mix of thrills and insanity that govern the plot structuring the film. To conclude on the Oscar chapter, I would have added the script, full of so many one-liners that almost flirt with comedy, and I'm not sure it was unintentional. Heywood Gould may not be famous for you, and for me, but only for this script, he would have deserved an Oscar nod.And forget about political matters, this movie condemns barbarity but not in the way you'd expect. All you have to do is to keep in mind, there is a Sci-Fi element in this film that might fool you in the beginning, because everything else is perfectly normal. There's just this little something that takes you by surprise and makes the rest of the film so incredible. This thing is precisely what all this Boys from Brazil business is about, and it won't be a samba party! Consider the two great actors involved in a cat-and-mouse thriller to serve an ingenious but diabolical scheme lead by one of the most redoubtable Nazi War criminals, portrayed here in a fictionalized role, and you'll get what you expect in a cinematic tour from Vienna to London, with a detour from Paraguay and a terminus in Pennsylvania. The last part features the most memorable lines, so priceless I think I remembered them after one viewing.Finally, I should also mention the other great presence of the suave James Mason in one of his last memorable roles. In fact, the whole film is lead by elderly actors, making it like a tribute to a generation that would desert the cinematic scene very soon. The 70's constituted for many of them the occasion for last shining moments. And The Boys From Brazil is one of the last great films of the 70's, whose underestimation is not even a problem because it creates many pleasant surprises to those who don't know about the film and who just want to discover, how the same actor who played Dr. Christian 'Is it safe? Szell can play a totally opposite role. Nothing else to say except that I highly recommend this film.

","genre":"Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"22 May 2011","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Prepare yourself for a delightful waltz with twists and thrills in one of these underrated gems like only the 70's could have brought up on our screens. I named The Boys From Brazil Franklyn Shaffner's exquisitely captivating thriller, starring two of the most beloved and respected actors of Hollywood's Golden Age Gregory Peck and Sir Laurence Olivier. Two classy gentlemen in two roles that couldn't have been more antagonistic Gregory Peck as the evil Dr. Jozef Mengele and Laurence Oliver as Ezra Lieberman, a veteran Nazi Hunter, whose life is dedicated to honor the memory of the Holocaust's victims by chasing and punishing their executioners.And the first surprise that will probably tease your mind in the first part of the film, concerns the acting department. Both Olivier and Peck are amazing and for two different reasons. While Olivier proves again his tremendous versatility by playing a venerable and inspiring Nazi-hunter after having portrayed the evilly iconic Nazi dentist, Dr. Christian Szell two years before in Marathon Man, Gregory Peck surprises us through a role which is a 180 degree turn from good old Atticus Finch... and it's one of these villainous performances that impacts you whether you take them seriously or not. Peck is indeed a delight to watch.But I know I shouldn't use that word because Peck is playing a particularly despicable character, even worse because he really existed. While Szell was based on Mengele, Peck played Mengele. The character is the real-life Nazi doctor whose crimes in concentration camps reached a level of barbarity so atrocious one could wonder how we can decently make a character enjoyable to watch, out of this man. But the cleverness of Heywood Gould's script relies on its approach of this quite difficult subject. The approach is simple the film is a thriller adapted from a Sci-Fi novel, helped by Schaffner's impeccable direction. The whole story is based on an incredible plot device so original, so unexpected that you understand you can't take the movie seriously, and I mean this as a compliment. It's a movie that doesn't pretend to be another thing than a movie, its purpose is to entertain and to thrill us though a complex and puzzling plot whose twist is revealed earlier enough to make the climax more enjoyable. Anyway, at the end, you're satisfied. And believe me, you'll be surprised.And that's what I loved about the film, its unpretentiousness to deal with a difficult subject in a subtle over-the-top but necessary way, because ironically the movie could only work by distancing itself from gravity and seriousness. Don't expect intellectual complexity, or Oscar worthy performances, but you can expect one hell of an entertainment from beginning to end. The movie got some Oscar nods though starting with Laurence Olivier in the lead role -while Peck got a Golden Globe nomination- I concede that both were great but not really Oscar worthy. I guess I'm biased because I would have nominated Brad Davis for Midnight Express instead. The editing was rightfully nominated, and so was Jerry Goldsmith's brilliant score, a well-deserved nomination for a score that perfectly delivers the mix of thrills and insanity that govern the plot structuring the film. To conclude on the Oscar chapter, I would have added the script, full of so many one-liners that almost flirt with comedy, and I'm not sure it was unintentional. Heywood Gould may not be famous for you, and for me, but only for this script, he would have deserved an Oscar nod.And forget about political matters, this movie condemns barbarity but not in the way you'd expect. All you have to do is to keep in mind, there is a Sci-Fi element in this film that might fool you in the beginning, because everything else is perfectly normal. There's just this little something that takes you by surprise and makes the rest of the film so incredible. This thing is precisely what all this Boys from Brazil business is about, and it won't be a samba party! Consider the two great actors involved in a cat-and-mouse thriller to serve an ingenious but diabolical scheme lead by one of the most redoubtable Nazi War criminals, portrayed here in a fictionalized role, and you'll get what you expect in a cinematic tour from Vienna to London, with a detour from Paraguay and a terminus in Pennsylvania. The last part features the most memorable lines, so priceless I think I remembered them after one viewing.Finally, I should also mention the other great presence of the suave James Mason in one of his last memorable roles. In fact, the whole film is lead by elderly actors, making it like a tribute to a generation that would desert the cinematic scene very soon. The 70's constituted for many of them the occasion for last shining moments. And The Boys From Brazil is one of the last great films of the 70's, whose underestimation is not even a problem because it creates many pleasant surprises to those who don't know about the film and who just want to discover, how the same actor who played Dr. Christian 'Is it safe?

Marty plunges us into Sam Ace Rothstein's universe through a hypnotic flamboyance, working like a reminiscence of another Gangster classic, Scarface; and Robert De Niro is as charismatic and respectable as ever. I wanted to be this Ace, this manager whose infallible competence in gambling, betting and defining odds made it sound like an exact science. The opening is about a competence, and boy, how refreshing it was to see in a Marty's film, a man who loves his profession, and who's not a gangster. This part is the reason why I like and respect Casino as a cinematic achievement. And Marty's direction deserved an Oscar nod, if only for this moment where Ace tries to find out how some customers cheat.This part absorbs me so much I always wish it would never end. But you can't expect from a Scorsese film to avoid the cherished theme of guilt, and no guilt without a mistake. So, we wait for it to come, remembering the very first lines wondering how this could have gone wrong? Ace was the Tangiers' undisputed boss, protected by the mob 'back home', who controlled the casino through the notoriously corrupted (at least in mafia films) teamsters' union. Plus, Ace had a feared bodyguard, the psychopathic Nicky Santoro, Joe Pesci in a performance that would have been more impacting if it hadn't been preceded by Tommy De Vito. In fact, the whole movie has a deja-vu feeling due to its plot's similarity with Goodfellas but this wasn't a problem for me.The problem was the hypocrisy of the whole how things could have gone wrong. You expect the movie to introduce it smoothly while in fact, as soon as it starts going wrong, the whole narrative, is structured by a series of mistakes. Nicky was at least honest and explicit about his intentions in Las Vegas. He wanted to squeeze the town until the last drop. He wanted the big thing, and no one to step him over, he didn't care about warnings, about his bosses' instructions, he was in a gangster's oasis in the middle of nowhere, and Ace trying to reason him was as laughable as his attempt to conquer Ginger's heart. Nicky's 'pen in the neck' was a premonition of him being the pain in the ass. But still, he was the guy whose friendship prevented Sam to act against him, like Charlie and Johnny Boy in Mean Streets. One weakness, I could have handled; but another was one too much, and I'm talking of Ginger, Sharon Stone in her Oscar nominated role.In fact, even Ginger's entrance bothered me, because Marty and Bobby portrayed Sam as a meticulous man who means business and tolerates absolutely no imperfection. So, I didn't buy that he would let a woman throw the chips in the air like this, even for a 'love at first sight' moment, I thought the movie immediately lost its gripping realism, and it's one of the few weaknesses I noticed, after the dummy in the car's explosion and before Anna Scott's strangely blood-less murder. I couldn't believe the guy who told the croupier to perfectly align the chips, or the cook to keep the same quantity of blueberries in the muffins would let this happen. Well, let's concede that it was love, and Bobby played perfectly the part of a man who wants a desirable blonde so much (indeed, she was beautiful) that he didn't care about being loved. And we understand this would be his downfall. But it just started the very day of their marriage, when she was calling her ex-pimp, James Woods as a believable scumbag named Lester. Couldn't Ace get the point? That's Casino's problem problems come too early, we know it will be an infernal spiral until a bloody climax would purge out the bad blood, it's just a matter of time before it'll explode, before Sam beats the hell out of Ginger, before Nicky gets his comeuppance etc. Basically, Casino is about people wondering how they screwed up, while they had it coming from the start. It's about a situation with people being their own liabilities and the icing on the cake was the disturbing sex moment between Nicky and Ginger. I wouldn't care if Casino was at least a half-hour shorter, but it spans too much time on the 'problems' sequence, it gets redundant and annoying, too much shouting, arguing and of course narrating. Hell, at one point even Nicky's sidekick, Frank Vincent as the namesake Marino, started doing voice-over. The movie reached an extraordinary level of noisiness where even the soundtrack got in my nerves, the part with Ginger and Lester and the Can't Live if Living is Without You song was annoyance at its peak before Marty finally redeemed the film.At the end, Casino finally reconciles with the idea that we're watching a Gangster film, and that all this mess must come to an end now, and all the protagonists of this tragicomedy must meet their maker, in the most gruesome way if possible. And I can't go on without mentioning that particularly gruesome and disturbing scene, where Nicky witnesses the death of his brother Dominick before receiving the same batting treatment from Marino and the gang. Billy Batts' revenge broke both Nicky's bones and my heart, and his crying followed by a bloody face half-breathing before covered by sand, will haunt me forever.Casino starts and ends with intensity, but in-between &#x85; well, it's like starting a Texas Holdem game, with a pair in your hands, expecting to win with two pairs, or a three of a kind, but at the end, you just win because all the players folded.

Also notice young and then unknown Benicio Del Toro as one of Sanchez's henchmen.Out of the two Bond films Timothy Dalton was in, License to Kill is not quite as good as The Living Daylights but it's worth your time, especially if you like to see more serious, no bull-it Bond in action. Considering that it is the last Bond film made when the wall of Berlin and Soviet Union still existed, it is a great end of an era in Bond films.

It is really the story of Lonnie, a young man who has to make a choice in his life, the choice his own father made before he was killed by Hud's own recklessness. Hud, played brilliantly by Paul Newman, is a slick, handsome, but narcissistic cowboy who seeks the quick and easy, the fast buck and the lonely housewife rather than build something of his own that will last. Rather than work for something of his own, he seeks to undermine the ranch his father owns for himself. Rather than do the right thing where potentially diseased cattle are concerned, he'd go for the fast buck passing it off to the market. But Newman played it so well that he seemed like just the right anti-hero to so many who saw themselves twisting in the shadow of a generation that seemed amazing by comparison to their own. Lonnie doesn't know what Hud is until he sees it for himself. Without the experience or the maturity of life, Lonnie is lured by Hud's magnetism for a brief period, ignoring Hud's obvious flaws for a bit of carefree fun that he seems to embody. One of the most profound lines in cinema is said by Homer, Hud's father, to Lonnie. He says, Little by little, the look of a country changes by the people we admire. This means that we tolerate the evil in our lives because it's pretty, it appeals to our vanity, and our ambitions of what we want to be someday. But evil is corrosive, pervasive, and relentless, always wanting to drag more and more people into the muck that Hud himself describes. Lonnie decides to hold himself above the muck, and clean himself off if he so happens to fall. Hud is a play about the importance of Morality, and how it impacts our lives, and should be standard viewing each and every year for everyone.

Yet, regardless of synopses, 'Jules and Jim' is among a rare class of film that utilizes beautifully poetic editing and photography for the paradoxical purpose of cold, pragmatic storytelling, and utilizes it well.'Jules and Jim' tells the story of two friends (take a wild guess what their names are) who simultaneously fall head over heels for Catherine, a rather sadistic tease whose capricious romantic affections create a minor rivalry between the pair. The fact that much of the film takes place after the First World War, in which the two fought on OPPOSITE SIDES, doesn't help the situation.The plot comes off as a predictable melodrama, and it is, but what makes 'Jules and Jim' so wonderful is the ironic way in which it recounts this melodrama. Being a French New Wave production, there are of course lots of jarringly undramatic edits, shots, and voice-overs (the film has quite possibly the world's most deadpan narrator), all of which contrast beautifully with the fatuous love triangle at the centre of the film that ultimately spirals into tragedy. If it weren't for the levity of Truffaut's storytelling and his own claim that the film was a hymn to life, one could swear the film was deeply misanthropic.As it is, though, 'Jules and Jim' is more a celebration of the momentary bliss of youthful love and vitality, acknowledging at the same time how clinging to those things can often lead to disillusionment and destruction. In other words, somebody needs to show this film to Madonna.'New Wave' films may have an inconvenient propensity to polarise, but if by hearing a man with an exaggerated monotone (please forgive my tendency toward oxy-morons) indifferently regaling you with a tale of absurd melodrama you do not want to thank the Lord God (or whichever deity you may reverently pester) for the miracle of cinema, then you should be ashamed to consider yourself a cinephile.

I did acquire it from ulterior sources some time ago and, now that I was going through a Vincent Price phase on account of his centenary, I had the opportunity (or the excuse) to finally submit myself to it! Even if producer Milton Subotsky lived on for 10 more years and he made other films after it, THE MONSTER CLUB proved to be, sadly but unsurprisingly, Amicus' swan-song.Actually, on paper, this had all the right ingredients to succeed as much as Amicus' earlier efforts given the participation of past alumni like director Baker, stars Price, Donald Pleasence, Britt Ekland and Richard Johnson, plus character actors Patrick Magee and Geoffrey Bayldon &#x96; not to mention new additions like John Carradine, Stuart Whitman, Simon Ward (who, 3 years earlier, had appeared in Subotsky's non-Amicus but equally strongly-cast DOMINIQUE) and Anthony Steel! Apparently Christopher Lee was the first choice for the part eventually played by Carradine and Klaus Kinski was also offered a role but declined! Where it does go horribly wrong, however, is in the disco-set(!) bookend sequences in which vampire Price (only his second time playing a traditional monster! and an expert in monster genealogy, the hybrids between species and even humans being given would-be hilarious names) takes celebrated horror author Carradine (after giving him one harmless little bite!) for some more legitimately served liquid sustenance at the ghastly titular abode (which has a werewolf for a secretary!) brimming with hideously made-up punters embarrassingly gyrating on the dance floor to the sounds of UB40 and The Pretty Things (who perform the ska-tinged title song as Carradine and Price get embarrassingly footloose, the latter with a so-called Buxom Beauty!) among others!! Still, if one were to twist my arm I would have to say that I did like 2 of the cheesy numbers performed therein Night's The Stripper (with red-haired singer Stevie Lange energetically belting it out and accompanied by a blonde who, literally, strips all the way down to her bones &#x96; albeit in a silhouetted bit of animation!) and B.A. Robertson's cheekily goth Sucker For Your Love; the stupid Monsters Rule O.K tune is best forgotten, however.As for the trilogy of tales, these are decent enough in themselves but nothing that we have not seen before in better movies. The first has James Laurenson as a Shadmuck(!) whose whistle can prove deadly (a greedy cat falls victim to it after it attacks his pet pigeons), as well as Barbara Kellerman and the above-mentioned Ward as a couple who intend to rob the reclusive 'monster' of his fortune. To this end, the woman presents herself for a secretarial job but, besotted with her beauty, he asks her to marry him; naturally, she wants out of the scheme after that but Ward persuades her to go along with the ruse. At the nuptials, Laurenson's monstrous family turns up for a fancy dress ball (recalling the opening scene of Price's classic vehicle THE ABOMINABLE DR. PHIBES 1971) while Kellerman absents herself from the festivities to loot her brand-new hubby's safe. Caught in the act, he gives her the whistle...and she goes back to Ward a monster, assuring him that he can learn to love her despite her gruesome appearance (a hope Laurenson himself had harbored in her case), which drives Ward off-the-wall.The second tale involves the childhood of film producer Lintom Busotsky (Steel, obviously sending up Subotsky himself!) among his vampire parents Johnson and Ekland who are forever 'stalked not staked' by vampire hunter (masquerading as a priest) Pleasence and his men (who include Neil McCarthy, the memorably hideous Calibos in the contemporaneous original Malta-shot version of CLASH OF THE TITANS). This is perhaps the most enjoyable segment, largely eschewing the others' glumness for amusing campiness (especially by way of Johnson's look and Pleasence's antics &#x96; though the latter thinks he has killed the vampire, Johnson is revealed to have been wearing a stake-proof vest and, 'infecting' Pleasence, the vampire hunter can do nothing to stop his own men from giving him a dose of his own medicine!).The third story finds Stuart Whitman as a Hollywood director filming a horror film in London. Distracted by the unprofessionalism of his associates (a dig at the fall of British cinema, perhaps?), he goes in search of real atmosphere and stumbles upon a village that seems lost in time, presided over by creepy inn-keeper Magee. Eventually, it transpires that the locals are all ghouls (or, if you like, zombies) as, in fact, the graveyard is filled with holes through which the corpses had risen! Magee's daughter is the only normal person since she is a Hum-goo(!) and, given that she tries to alert him to the danger (he manages to barricade himself in the church fending off the hungry assailants with a large crucifix), eventually falls victim to their wrath as the couple flee. Meeting up with a cop, Whitman thinks he has reached safety but the car soon takes him back to where he had come from as it was officially escorting the Elders of the village just arrived from the netherworld to celebrate its anniversary! This is easily the least effective episode (if mainly because it is the most ordinary, with Magee in particular wasted); however, it does garner some extra points via the use of evocative illustrations in the flashbacks depicting the history of the cursed community.

PHIBES 1971) while Kellerman absents herself from the festivities to loot her brand-new hubby's safe. Caught in the act, he gives her the whistle...and she goes back to Ward a monster, assuring him that he can learn to love her despite her gruesome appearance (a hope Laurenson himself had harbored in her case), which drives Ward off-the-wall.The second tale involves the childhood of film producer Lintom Busotsky (Steel, obviously sending up Subotsky himself!) among his vampire parents Johnson and Ekland who are forever 'stalked not staked' by vampire hunter (masquerading as a priest) Pleasence and his men (who include Neil McCarthy, the memorably hideous Calibos in the contemporaneous original Malta-shot version of CLASH OF THE TITANS). This is perhaps the most enjoyable segment, largely eschewing the others' glumness for amusing campiness (especially by way of Johnson's look and Pleasence's antics &#x96; though the latter thinks he has killed the vampire, Johnson is revealed to have been wearing a stake-proof vest and, 'infecting' Pleasence, the vampire hunter can do nothing to stop his own men from giving him a dose of his own medicine!).The third story finds Stuart Whitman as a Hollywood director filming a horror film in London. Distracted by the unprofessionalism of his associates (a dig at the fall of British cinema, perhaps?), he goes in search of real atmosphere and stumbles upon a village that seems lost in time, presided over by creepy inn-keeper Magee. Eventually, it transpires that the locals are all ghouls (or, if you like, zombies) as, in fact, the graveyard is filled with holes through which the corpses had risen! Magee's daughter is the only normal person since she is a Hum-goo(!) and, given that she tries to alert him to the danger (he manages to barricade himself in the church fending off the hungry assailants with a large crucifix), eventually falls victim to their wrath as the couple flee. Meeting up with a cop, Whitman thinks he has reached safety but the car soon takes him back to where he had come from as it was officially escorting the Elders of the village just arrived from the netherworld to celebrate its anniversary!

I did acquire it from ulterior sources some time ago and, now that I was going through a Vincent Price phase on account of his centenary, I had the opportunity (or the excuse) to finally submit myself to it! Even if producer Milton Subotsky lived on for 10 more years and he made other films after it, THE MONSTER CLUB proved to be, sadly but unsurprisingly, Amicus' swan-song.Actually, on paper, this had all the right ingredients to succeed as much as Amicus' earlier efforts given the participation of past alumni like director Baker, stars Price, Donald Pleasence, Britt Ekland and Richard Johnson, plus character actors Patrick Magee and Geoffrey Bayldon &#x96; not to mention new additions like John Carradine, Stuart Whitman, Simon Ward (who, 3 years earlier, had appeared in Subotsky's non-Amicus but equally strongly-cast DOMINIQUE) and Anthony Steel! Apparently Christopher Lee was the first choice for the part eventually played by Carradine and Klaus Kinski was also offered a role but declined! Where it does go horribly wrong, however, is in the disco-set(!) bookend sequences in which vampire Price (only his second time playing a traditional monster! and an expert in monster genealogy, the hybrids between species and even humans being given would-be hilarious names) takes celebrated horror author Carradine (after giving him one harmless little bite!) for some more legitimately served liquid sustenance at the ghastly titular abode (which has a werewolf for a secretary!) brimming with hideously made-up punters embarrassingly gyrating on the dance floor to the sounds of UB40 and The Pretty Things (who perform the ska-tinged title song as Carradine and Price get embarrassingly footloose, the latter with a so-called Buxom Beauty!) among others!! Still, if one were to twist my arm I would have to say that I did like 2 of the cheesy numbers performed therein Night's The Stripper (with red-haired singer Stevie Lange energetically belting it out and accompanied by a blonde who, literally, strips all the way down to her bones &#x96; albeit in a silhouetted bit of animation!) and B.A. Robertson's cheekily goth Sucker For Your Love; the stupid Monsters Rule O.K tune is best forgotten, however.As for the trilogy of tales, these are decent enough in themselves but nothing that we have not seen before in better movies. The first has James Laurenson as a Shadmuck(!) whose whistle can prove deadly (a greedy cat falls victim to it after it attacks his pet pigeons), as well as Barbara Kellerman and the above-mentioned Ward as a couple who intend to rob the reclusive 'monster' of his fortune. To this end, the woman presents herself for a secretarial job but, besotted with her beauty, he asks her to marry him; naturally, she wants out of the scheme after that but Ward persuades her to go along with the ruse.

Well is it a classic well yeah that's an easy one. This movie stars Peter O'toole as the sexually ambiguous T. E Lawrence who led the Arabs to freedom in the early part of the last century. This movie was directed by David Lean who also won an academy award for The bridge over the river kwai. What both these movies have in common is a grand scope and an eye for detail that is unparalleled in most movies. The movie has one problem it is 3 hours and 35 minute before the final credits start. It is only a big deal if you are planning to watch it in one sitting, but in general it doesn't play long. The long slow scenes don't play so because you really are brought into those seemingly infinite deserts and feel the struggle for survival experienced by the characters. This movie is about as well made as you can get, there is a fair amount of testosterone thrown around but this movie should appeal to both sexes. It is a true classic. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http\/\/raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"22 May 2011","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" So I watched the award winning Lawrence of Arabia from 1962. Well is it a classic well yeah that's an easy one. This movie stars Peter O'toole as the sexually ambiguous T. E Lawrence who led the Arabs to freedom in the early part of the last century.

I am a big horror\/scary movie fan and even though I didn't think this movie was very scary it was very suspenseful and very well made. The reason it was refreshing is it's not like most modern lets scare them type movies. The storyline was well done along with all other elements that go into making a movie. It didn't rely on sex\/blood\/gore\/cursing or any of the other things that film making rely on to get people to watch. It was a VERY VERY clean movie and was a nice step back from most of the modern movies. It also wasn't corny. Many horror\/scary movies are very corny but this one was well done and doesn't leave you saying, I saw that coming an hour ago. It's plot and twists aren't obvious so it leaves you curious and keeps your attention. It is a slow build up till the climactic end and well worth waiting for.All in all this movie will leave you very satisfied...I'm sure of it.
