The acting is good as well.  John Malkovich never ceases to please and Willem Dafoe makes an amazing transformation (with an outstanding makeup job) into the blood-sucking star of the F.W. Murnau classic Nosferatu.  His performance is quite good, though I expected him to get more screen time.  Since the Oscars are long gone, I'm not sure if he got nominated for Best Actor or Best Supporting Actor.  Though his performance is poignant and very impressive, and you can barely recognize Dafoe--not only through the copious makeup, but also through the accent and mannerisms, I can't measure it up to an Oscar-worthy level.  The premise is original and quite fun to play with.  This is a fictional account, and it's interesting how the screenwriter conjured up the idea--after indulging the brutal realism of the classic vampire flick--of making the star, Max Shrek, an actual vampire.  This spawns some darkly comic moments, like the scene where the bloodthirsty ghoul murders the cameraman and Malkovich as Murnau screams out, Why did you have to murder the cameraman!!!  Why couldn't you murder the....script girl!!!  Shrek replies, Oh...I'll eat her later.  The whole film has that amusing mixture of horror and black comedy, reminiscent of Tim Burton's style of filmmaking.  The German accents are a little cheesy, but it's not a film meant to be taken with utter seriousness.  It's also nice how the director plays around with the idea of Murnau's unstoppable ambition, as he would picture it.  The kind of ambition that would coax him to do--literally--whatever it takes to complete this work of art, even if numerous people have to get killed in the process.  The ending perfectly demonstrates this raw ambition.  So it brings out a good sense of irony.  By the time the film is over, you start to realize that the real monster is not Shrek; it's Murnau.  But he's a monster with a dream.  A monster with a mission.  I'm sure there are few--if any--directors in history who've shared the exact thirst for the art form as Murnau in Shadow of the Vampire.  I don't know any directors who'd sacrifice their cast and crew for a movie.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  But it's meant to be an exaggerated account of how far a director would go.  And this exaggeration is the best way to express the idea.I love the musical score.  Along with the vivid art direction, the score helps accentuate the creepy mood to the point where it almost invades your subconscious.  I was, however, surprised by the running time.  I didn't anticipate a 90-minute film.  Yes, it's pretty snappy, and though I'm not sure how it would've been better if it were longer, I was still left with an Is that all? feeling.  Shadow of the Vampire is a smart, original, funny, entertaining, haunting piece.  It's well done, though I can't say it's a film that will stick in my mind for years to come.  For some reason, I just felt that it could've lived up to more.  Maybe they could've played around with the character of Shrek more frequently.  It was missing a tiny bit of something that I can't quite point out.  But I'm not going to lose sleep over it.  It's a good movie and definitely worth renting.

Danni, Mia's girlfriend is keen to move in, but Mia fears commitment.  Mia, who can be a solipsistic bitch (but in the nicest possible way), is obsessed with her favourite lecturer and becomes embroiled in a bureaucratic nightmare as she pursues him to his new department.  Alice, a frustrated perfectionist, is four years late with her thesis on Doris Day as a Feminist Warrior. She is looking for the perfect man, but can't find anyone who fits her rigorous criteria. Feeling the need for a change she falls for the most unsuitable man possible - Ari, a Classics student, part-time gigolo and the Warren Beatty of the campus.

So what then?As a Late Reviewer might say &#145;There are a number of levels.'I first saw the film three years ago when I bought it, ex-rental from a &#145;Blockbuster' video shop in Birkenhead.  It had no cover.  I just remembered the title because I knew that one of the few quite good actresses to be shipped through &#145;Neighbours' was in it.  It sat on my shelf for a month.  Then one afternoon I was at a loose end and put it on.  Eighty minutes later I'd wondered what hit me.On a basic level, it has everything I'd ever want from a film.  There was my love of low budget films, the slightly grainy look, the ingenious camera angles,  story told mainly in dialogue.  All of the actors doing there best for the script, seemingly not caring if they don't look absolutely great during every second.  The absolutely fabulous editing, scenes timed perfectly.  As though Robert Rodriguez had decided to spend his $7000 making romantic comedy instead of &#145;El Mariachi'.  The music from a largely unknown set of musicians actually complements to action, a soundtrack album actually being a benefit not a marketing exercise.But a lot of films fulfil these loves.  The aforementioned &#145;El Mariachi' for example.  So what else?The characters just are (I apologise to Louise if she's reading for the strain on the verb &#145;to be' in that phrase).  They exist within the story as though the writer just wanted people it would be cool to hang about with.  They aren't there to fulfil the machinations of some theme or other.  A lesser writer might have strained to make this another treatise on people coming to terms with their sexuality &#150; and anyone who's followed the Jack-arc on &#145;Dawson's Creek' will know how painfully that can be if not done right.  Like many films in what is become an indie film sub-genre (&#145;Chasing Amy', &#145;Sticky Fingers of Time', &#145;Go Fish'), the characters are quite comfortable with their sexuality thank you very much for checking.  It's not how you love, but who you love.  The fact that Danni and Mia are both girls isn't the issue.  Which makes watching the film a whole lot easier and more refreshing to watch.  Chumbawamba are disproved Homophobia might be the worst disease, but you can love who love in times like these.And?It's the script I've been writing in my head for years.  The students away at college is a surprisingly untapped film genre (unless knives or frat parties are involved).  Not quite teens, not quite adults, its difficult to completely get a handle on it.  Perhaps it's just that writers feel that not much excitement can be wrung out of find a housemate or waiting for a course transfer.  Emma-Kate Croghan, the writer-director of this piece seems to have succeeded.  Are heart misses a beat when we find that Mia might not get her course transfer or when Alice fails to find a house mate.  I showed it to my Greek friend Fani, who is much the same predicament as the characters and she loved it.  Even though the film is Australian, the experience is universal.But the get to the route of the matter, the film actually made me think about what I was doing with my life and my relationship to people.  I realised that although it's important to have your ol' friends and family, that you shouldn't stop looking to be friends with new people, who might in turn become close friends (hey Fani!).  It made me pull my socks up and go look for something better.  And so it goes and so it goes and so it goes . ..A mark out of five is meaningless.  You must simply see this film.

","genre":"Comedy, Romance"},{"date":"5 June 2001","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":"  At the end of this film a major character point is concluded through the following question.  I'm telling you this because I'm about to become hopelessly recursive and it's probably a good thing to point this out before we I go any further.  The question isWhat are your three favourite films and why?Not easy.  I film fan will probably jibber and faint.  Out of all of the films ever made ever?  Are you joking?  We like films for lots of different reasons.  Within this film, the question seems to actually meanWhich three films mean the most to you and couldn't you live without?The exercise is simplified.  The film fan sighs deeply and puts down their &#145;Time Out Film Guide', safe in the knowledge they won't have to include anything because they feel like the have to &#150; so out with Fellini, Bergman, Kurosawa and the gang.  Just for fun, go away and write your answer to the question.  You may be surprised.Back?  Good.  Surprised?  When you have to justify your favourite films and extra texture is added.  It's as though you've got to look into yourself and find out who you actually are.  The chances are you've actually just learned something about yourself.  Why am I stringing this out?  Because when I asked myself this question, here are the three films I came up with and the reasonsWhen Harry Met Sally because I think I'm a New Yorker living in the wrong place and it makes me smile every time I watch it Star Wars because it always means I have something to talk about with total strangers Love and Other Catastrophes because it felt like the first film I've seen about meSee &#150; told you this review was going to be recursive.  Believe me, I was a shocked as you possibly might be.  I thought &#145;Ferris Bueller's Day Off' was a shoo-in.  Anyone who's seen the film already will wonder what that means (especially anyone who knows me).  But it's not for the reasons your expecting.  This is the synopsis from the official website (reproduced here with much rebellion and without permission) &#145;Mia and Alice have just moved into a warehouse apartment but are still minus a house mate. Danni, Mia's girlfriend is keen to move in, but Mia fears commitment.  Mia, who can be a solipsistic bitch (but in the nicest possible way), is obsessed with her favourite lecturer and becomes embroiled in a bureaucratic nightmare as she pursues him to his new department.  Alice, a frustrated perfectionist, is four years late with her thesis on Doris Day as a Feminist Warrior. She is looking for the perfect man, but can't find anyone who fits her rigorous criteria. Feeling the need for a change she falls for the most unsuitable man possible - Ari, a Classics student, part-time gigolo and the Warren Beatty of the campus. Little does she know that she has her own secret admirer - Michael, a shy medical student who is living in the share house from hell and wants out.  Her search for love transcends the boundaries of the University and their respective disciplines.  Omnia Vincit Amor...Love Conquers All.'I've edited that a bit &#150; the synopsis at the website does somewhat give the plot away.So you've read that and wondered still why it's about me.  Are rather you've assumed it's because I saw this film and realised for the first time I'm g-a-y.  Sorry to disappoint.  I'm not g-a-y.  I'm not even b-i.  I'm definitely s-t-r-a-i-g-h-t, ask my friend Chris.  So what then?As a Late Reviewer might say &#145;There are a number of levels.'I first saw the film three years ago when I bought it, ex-rental from a &#145;Blockbuster' video shop in Birkenhead.  It had no cover.  I just remembered the title because I knew that one of the few quite good actresses to be shipped through &#145;Neighbours' was in it.  It sat on my shelf for a month.  Then one afternoon I was at a loose end and put it on.  Eighty minutes later I'd wondered what hit me.On a basic level, it has everything I'd ever want from a film.  There was my love of low budget films, the slightly grainy look, the ingenious camera angles,  story told mainly in dialogue.  All of the actors doing there best for the script, seemingly not caring if they don't look absolutely great during every second.  The absolutely fabulous editing, scenes timed perfectly.  As though Robert Rodriguez had decided to spend his $7000 making romantic comedy instead of &#145;El Mariachi'.

As far as its quality as a movie, it was a big, steaming pile of crap!Let me break it down for you in basic terms. The soap opera storyline was insanely boring, stale, and fairly predictable, and the characters were flat. The actors brought nothing dynamic to their characters, either. The exception was the always-great Cuba Gooding, Jr., who was very underused. However, considering that African-Americans weren't allowed to play very major roles in the military during WWII, it is understandable. The special effects during the battle, however, were amazing, I will give them credit for that.I imagine there was some sort of meeting between Bruckheimer and Bay about their next movie after Armageddon. They probably thought for all of five minutes, decided that to make more money, they need bullets and bombs, and quickly settled for WWII, and, more specifically, Pearl Harbor. Then there was the question of how to appeal to the widest demographic. Since bombs and bullets pretty much covered the guys, they probably threw a love story in there for the women, and an African American character for African-Americans. Was Dorie Miller an important part? Of course, but did they give him as much coverage as the two main characters, or, for that matter, as much as he deserved? No, which suggests to me that they threw him in there for the demographic, as his part was far from fully developed.Does it stack up to Saving Private Ryan? Hell no, and to suggest it is ridiculous. The characters in Ryan are more three-dimensional, and the actors were better as well. Ryan shows that you can make a damn good three hour war movie that doesn't need to pander to the masses and still be commercially successful. The action in Ryan, while not as expensive, was much more realistic. Pearl Harbor fell prey to the Episode One syndrome, in that they overdid the special effects to the point where they were far from realistic. On top of it, Pearl Harbor was rated PG-13, as opposed to Ryan, which was rated R, showing that it didn't pull any punches with its graphic nature. Blame it on Disney, the family-friendly studio who probably didn't want blood and gore attached to their project, or, realism. The PG-13 rating once again suggests that they wanted to appeal to as wide an audience as possible and skip that pesky under 17, R-rated policy to grab as many teenagers as possible.And how bad was the story itself? Aside from what the trailers and teasers gave away, it was very predictable. As soon as Evelyn told Rafe she would give her heart to Danny, but still love him, you knew that Danny was going to die and Rafe was going to live. How? Well, first of all, Ben Affleck is the main character, and Josh Hartnett is the supporting character. Ben Affleck is considered the bigger sex symbol, so to appease the majority of women, he, of course, gets the girl. It's typical sappy love story crap. Of course, in this movie, as opposed to a love story, it doesn't fit. It is also hard to believe that with the seemingly hundreds of planes in Pearl Harbor, only two were scrambled, and because it's what people like to see, both are piloted by the heroes. I'm not an expert in Pearl Harbor history, so it may have been true that only two made it.So, the final verdict? Bruckheimer and Bay made this movie for the money, and have lost their artistic integrity as far as I am concerned, as well as my respect. The problem was that they spent way too much money on the special effects, and not enough on the story. On top of it, they seemed to have forgotten that they were dealing with a historic event, and they do not have the right to change events to make the movie more entertaining for the masses.Final Verdict - 4\/10.

Having just watched it again, I feel compelled to add to my (much) earlier comments on this picture and respond to a couple of other comments.First, I would like to address the issue of plot. Some have described it as paper thin or cliche. The extreme over-reliance on plot over story is the Achilles heel of many a film. I realize some people like a complicated plot, but in the language of cinema plot is a framework. Many films today -- I daresay most -- are not made in the language of cinema, and are made in the language of expository prose, including many pictures I like quite a lot. Many films have a complex and intriguing plot yet fail to tell a compelling story.My point is that the simple plot (love stories, stolen sword) and indeed the genre trappings in the picture serve as the framework for a story that is told almost exclusively visually. Almost all of the emotional punch of this tale is told visually, in cinematic language rather than clunky exposition. And what is this story about? Simply, about letting go of who you are, in the face of the fear of who you might be becoming, in order that you might become whom you need to become. The plot is simple, the story, complex and mutlifaceted.If that sounds like hokum to you, perhaps it's best that you move on to a standard chop-socky picture. Chances are you will not enjoy this rich and wonderful film.Also, I'd like to comment on the supposed woodenness of Michelle Yeoh as remarked by some negative posters. Ms. Yeoh's performance is, in my view, a tour de force. Her character has a world of things happening within, but her culture imposes restraint in so many areas, restraint eloquently expressed by Ms. Yeoh with simple gestures and expressions. It is for precisely this reason that the fight scenes between Ms. Yeoh and Ms. Xiyi have such an elemental and raw power to them. It is as if all that has been repressed is released with extraordinary focus.Finally, I would like to address two painful comments made by other posters. One opines If you want to see a good plot, watch Gladiator. Gladiator is a good example of all plot, no story, and as hackneyed and recycled plot as has been seen onscreen in many a year. It seems to have been assembled, as so many have commented, from old Spartacus, Fall of the Roman Empire, and Ben Hur screenplays. The dialogue is ludicrous and even the critical plot points dazzle in their banality. The incredibly paranoid, wimpy and unskilled Roman emperor will get into the ring with the deadliest gladiator of all time? Why? So the plot can continue to grind its way forward, clockwork-like, and the emotions of you, the viewer, can be manipulated with appallingly predictable results. Are you not entertained? And yet, what is the story about? There really is no story. Only plot.Another poster offered If a movie had great special effects, but terrible acting and a paper-thin plot, the average 2000\/01 moviegoer would scream about how terrible Hollywood was getting.  Cf. my comments re Gladiator above, and the screaming of every cineaste I know when viewing Pearl Harbor or at least 75% of the tripe that is rehashed, assembled from a kit, reheated and served up lukewarm, with a cold and manipulative calculation, to willing audiences who at least appear to lap it up.CTHD is a unique and heartfelt work that works on levels well below (and above) the superficial level of plot. That people who disdain it do so because of the paper-thin plot yet extol the virtues of Gladiator explains the ascendance of plot over story, of simplistic exposition over visual storytelling, and ultimately, the slow demise of film as a legitimate popular art form.Many people, it seems, don't want to be bothered looking below the surface, in art or indeed in their lives. They would much rather have things spelled out and spoon-fed to them. It's so much easier that way, isn't it? One doesn't have to think too much then.How we feel about art is often a good indicator of how we feel about ourselves. Are you not entertained?

One doesn't have to think too much then.How we feel about art is often a good indicator of how we feel about ourselves. Are you not entertained?

SPOILERS I want to correct some of Detlef Schwede's major misconceptions.  I agreed with most of what he said, but then at the end he said that Georges' and Harry's friendship will not be long-lasting... That's untrue because it's one of those friendships that has affected both of them immensely and will go on forever whether or not they are together in the physical world. Also, Georges does not commit suicide because he cannot find love of the other sex, which he finds with Nathalie; he commits suicide because he does not feel that he belongs in this world where he does not fit in because he is not normal.  He misses his mother and her love so much that he commits suicide.  And finally, Harry does not turn into a city tramp. He is enjoying life, having a cup of coffee and someone walks by and puts money in his cup, mistaking him for a homeless person. That does not mean that he becomes actually is homeless. You can see this because Harry laughs it off. I was really enjoying Detlef's comments until I came to the end and saw those blatant misconstructions of the facts.  If you haven't seen the movie, definitely rent it and watch it.  It is well worth it.

I can't think of a movie concerning drug use that takes its subject matter so seriously.  This movie will make you think twice about EVER doing drugs, unfortunately, for this user, it came too late...and I'm somewhat disturbed to  say it made me hungry, if you know what I'm saying... Anyway Seriously, this is a movie that should be shown to kids to show them the dangers of hard drug abuse.  Every one of these characters undergoes the tortures of the damned as a result of their addiction to drugs, from crack to diet pills(uppers) to heroin.  This movie messed with my head with all the cinematic tools of genius employed by ardnovsky, the director of Pi.  It will literally make your head spin, and leave you haunted by what you have seen. This movie is all about ESCAPES, which unfortunately, is what possesses many drug users to do drugs.   From Sarah, an older woman who's going to be on TELEVISION watching the boob tube all day, eating herself to death and finally downing diet pills like candy, to Jim, with his heroin infected arm, this movie will haunt you for many a day.  This is simply a must see...but be assured...it won't be pretty. HIGHLY and I do mean HIGHly recommended, for sure.

I cannot understand why this movie has been bashed so much. The plot was excellent and the acting on the part of Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett was superb and so superb that in my opinion Josh Hartnett deserves to be nominated for an Oscar for this movie. From the very beginning right up until the end, this movie held my attention. There wasn't one boring scene. Never in my life have I seen a movie so well acted out and true to real life! The time flew while watching this movie and not an empty seat was in the theater. This is a great story with great acting, directing, special effects, sound, score and fantastic cinematography that would take your breath away. I strongly recommend everyone go and see this fantastic movie. I know for a fact I will be going to see it again and I certainly will be getting it when it comes out on video. I wish more movies like this were made these days!
