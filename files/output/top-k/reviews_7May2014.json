There's no doubt that this film wanted to out-do the previously released epics and the size of the sets and the entire number of extras will just have you shaking your head wondering how any of it was done. Obviously, the film will always be remembered for its legendary chariot race, which still looks downright amazing all these decades later. You'll certainly be holding your breathe throughout the entire race and just the epic scale of this is just something we will never see again.

With a smartly written, acted and directed story you can't help but watch this and enjoy it and take in the sights of this wonderfully set movie. I enjoyed all of it and for those who enjoy westerns I couldn't recommend this more as a piece. I felt it was a an Excellent and Great film and below is why I felt that about it, and so many other people did too.The story as I say is smart and well thought out, and with some great characters and parallel families, it just makes for one big and fun western, oh and with some bloody violence too. I guess to say this is fun is the wrong word and although it is hugely enjoyable the story is dark and makes for drama at some points, but then goes into some good old gun shoot outs(including the old extremely loud gunshots we got in classic western films). Finally we get a character who guides us through a slow plot but he does it so well it seems even faster.Clint Eastwood in the main role without a name is superb and his menacing voice coupled with his great performance makes for an interesting acting role indeed. I loved the supporting cast and even though no one stands out anywhere near Eastwood, they still do a great job and do what all supporting casts should do even today in film. Finally on the acting it is strong, for some films like this they don't all do well but in this you feel everyone does what there meant to do all the way through.Director Sergio Leone does his job here every well and if it wasn't for the other films in the Man With No Name series then this would be his finest by far. He also had a hand in writing this as well and with a massive writing team we got a great script that when put together with the film is just superb. I liked the chase scenes, gun scenes and anything in the beautiful landscape and for when this was made the quality of the stunts and deaths are great and they don't seem cheesy at all which can happen so often in films of this era.I felt criticism wise that although it warrants very very little, the story could be seen as over dramatic and too much cheesy lines and violence that doesn't fit in with the more quiet scenes. I don't feel they affected it and weren't cheesy etc but that is what could be said about the film. As I have said before I think you have to form your own opinion if you like it or not as I couldn't really find much to criticise this about really.I would Recommend this to those who enjoy a good western film or those who like a good bit of action but it also being drama and tense moments where a shoot-out could happen any second. I believe many will enjoy this as the story is thick with smartly written lines and I said about the tense shoot-outs, well they are every tense and in a sense you could describe this film as a thriller film because sometimes your heart can beat faster when the more quiet stand off's are around.Overall I give it a 8\/10 and it is a Great and Excellent film and a firm one of that. I think some will like this film even more than I do, where as some I believe will dislike it, but the only way to find out is to watch it, because the film is classic cinema using one of if not the most famous western star of all time in Clint Eastwood.

With a good cast and a villain that was wasted though, Moonraker is a film that will split peoples decision and some will also love it. I felt it was solidly OK- ish and maybe moving towards being OK, and here is why I felt that about it.The story is fast and fun and although of course is a more silly, outlandish Bond plot, it can still be thoroughly entertaining. The pace is slow and takes a little while to really get stuck into the plot nevertheless it could be rewarding for some, I meanwhile felt average on that point. Finally on plot it is crazy at the end now I won't tell you, but Oh my it truly is crazy and you may see what I am talking about, it dragged it's mark down considerably which was only about a 5 minute scene.Moore is fun of course and does what we always expect from him with his humorous performance and light hearted action, he manages an OK job, even among all the excess mess. The rest of the cast do not do that well really and although I did feel it was poor that wise, they manages to not destroy this film. Finally on the characters the villain named Drax was actually kind of a good bad guy and managed even with his bad acting performance to feel sinister and a good example of how to portray super villains.The script is poor and very much overly trying to be humorous and just ruins the dialogues too. Directing is also poor and both contribute to the more poorer scenes, but they don't really affect it much. I did enjoy the gadgets with some cool contraption being made by not just Q but also Drax who's safe I felt was a piece of art(in film). The cinematography wasn't too bad either and with some great shots of the second half of the film, it looks pretty good along with the ridged plot.The film is pretty poor though and most of is ridiculous, although I did say it was entertainment and that is what it is. The things I have already criticised are it's main bad points and not much else has to really be said either but if any little extra points have to be put down it is in the sense that the film continues it's point of making Bond much more lighter since Connery left his role as Bond.Bond series film fans should enjoy as always but I believe most won't find this there favourite one of all time with it's crazy plot, even for Roger Moore as Bond!. You can enjoy it I know it and I did too but it seriously isn't near being a straight good film, could be the worst of the Bond series but that is up to you, but maybe a heads up for those hoping to watch all the Bond's, Moonraker is not up to scratch.Overall a 6\/10 meaning Solidly Kind of OK and with some fun parts like I was saying, it can be entertaining for those willing to just let themselves go and stop thinking about what secret agents really do in this world. I feel a good point about this is it's craze with space as Bond has never been and a Bond hasn't been set there either but it is interesting to see the sets used in space here which do turn out well, they actually possibly make the film just a little tiny but better.

With a punch and a kick this is one of Moore's most fighting like films and I appreciated the down to basics approach that the film makers took on here, He also does all sorts of other things which is why I felt that this film was strongly kind of OK, and here below is why.The story is not the most great and awesome story Bond has ever taken on but he conducts in a manner which suggests it is a much more serious thing than what it really is in the end. Set around many luxury estates and others such places, A View to a Kill travels to some nice places and for the story this wraps around well and although parts can be more boring and seem unnecessary, the story is nevertheless entertaining. I felt it took on a darker tone for the first real times and the villain actually seemed quite hell bent on completing his massive objective.Roger Moore goes out with a movie which won't enthral everyone and although I felt here that Moore fights hand to hand more than any other, he still seems just too old and unable to do stunts well enough. Christopher Walken as the villain is not too bad and as I said the darker tones lead to him becoming one of the first if not the first villain to have very evil traits let alone his world plans. Everyone else does there job but other than Walken no one truly stands out, Grace Jones and her slightly intimidating character leave a scary imprint on your mind, the character is played superbly sinister.John Glen did a good job here and is one the saving factors for me even though people heckle this move so much. Written not so great it is still fun and with some fun stunts and nice fight scenes it makes for probably the only movie that is dark yet very humorous. I especially loved the car scene in Paris which in well I won't ruin it but let's just say that Bond really knows how to drive a cut car and then also at the same time catch up to the people he is after.The film's main criticism usually is and rightly so is the fact that Roger Moore was 57 when he did this and was just way too old to portray this Bond he was showing. I also disliked the maybe parts of the film where you have Moore being humorous or light and the villain being overly dark as the two just don't mix and you could even say that for this one, the villain actually is overshadowing the performance of Roger Moore.Bond fans will possibly like this although I think it depends on when and who is Bond because this is as I say a mix of light heartedness with darkness and sometimes fails to blend. Those who like a good crime mystery may like it as Walken's villain is kind of hard to figure out at times and what comes next is never predicted and so a mystery thriller which a good one of that ensues here.

The plot is fun and of course a little silly as we come to expect but the film is pure entertainment and can be enjoyed by anyone who wises to let it do so. With a great cameo from (HEADS UP, MAYBE A SPOILER),Blofeld among other fun things, I felt this film was strongly an OK film, and here below is why I just felt that way about this piece.Bond is fun as ever in this and even though he is ageing, he still manages some good fighting talk and uses gadgets to the best of his ability. I liked the setting for this one and the story gains from it with some beautiful things used within and things such as Bond being dragged through Coral being oddly nice to look at. The movie is a distinctly faster speed than some of Moore's previous film, or maybe that is just the great 80's score used in chase scenes among other parts also. The story brings Bond into the eighties with a bang and serves up a fun adventure with a maybe more darkish theme.Moore does what he always does, play Bond with charm, wit and humour and still manages to save the day without firing a shot, in this one Moore can sometimes seem less suave and more commando as he even climbs a rock face, and he doesn't wear a tuxedo whilst doing it. Carole Bouquet as the Bond girl is good and actually isn't one his girls who seems scared of getting into the action, she is used just as much when it comes to violence and action. I also enjoyed Bond's little group of people he uses who help him in the film and make for a film where Bond is used in a team.Script is fun and so is directing, whether or not either being fun is a good thing is up to you to decide. As I previously mentioned, the setting is wonderfully beautiful and makes for a Bond set in some exotically if not always in the same place locations. I liked the sets used which were some of the best we have seen in Bond so far, with the underwater scenes which you will see as the forefront of this films great production design which was smartly efficient.The film suffers the same fate a lot of Moore's also do, he just doesn't seem like a real special agent, and at this age you would think his bones would be taking a bit hit from all these stunts, nevertheless Moore does seem to glide through them effortlessly. Some parts are a bit slow in all honesty and can bore you if you don't pay attention because some parts are just packed with dialogues, where as some parts are overly used action so although it works out well in the end, bit's can be partly dull.All Bond film fans should enjoy this as it is Moore being his ever self and doing everything he usually does, he doesn't change much at all but it still works well. I think those who enjoy seeing Bond do a little more fighting may be slightly disappointed as it lacks in that area, but only just a little in anyway. The film is also not one to say it is solidly rational, so if you are looking for rational action and adventure, stay away from this one, and on that note, all of Roger Moore's stints.Overall I give it a 6\/10, I did feel it was Strongly OK and worked well as a Bond film for me. This is the kind of Bond where you have to watch with a smile on your face and just enjoy it as a film, forget if some bits don't seem that real, just enjoy it to it's fullest, may not be near the best Bond movies either but still does a good job of entertainment.

So to keep my credibility as a cinephile, I finally said to myself self, watch this movie now, no more waiting. I also asked myself, what do I know about this movie? Well, it's got Clooney, Tarantino acts in it, Salma Hayek has a sexy dance with a sexy snake, and vampires are a big thing in the movie. Even knowing all that and with the movie being as old as it is, this movie completely caught me by surprise.George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino play two criminals, Seth and Richard Gecko, that are on the run, which we find out right off the bat, in a incredible opening sequence in a gas station. There eyes are set on the Mexican border for an escape, so they spot a little family (the father played by Harvey Keitel) traveling in an RV and get the idea to hijack the vehicle and take the polite family hostage. When the group get's to there destination, a shady little Mexican bar, all hell breaks loose when vampires turn out to run the place.It sounds corny, it sounds cheesy, campy, laughable, maybe a bit over the top, but BY THE NINE, this is not only a cool crime movie, not only is it a dark, creepy vampire movie, but this is a great movie in it's own right. It's so unique and good at how it tell's the story, and you gotta give major credit to director Robert Rodriguez, because the first half of the movie just feels like a dark, gritty, crime-thriller and if the movie would've just kept that tone through out I would've been perfectly fine, but once the setting jumps the fence into Mexico, a whole other level of a movie is unleashed. George Clooney gives one of my favorite performances I've seen from him, he has this menacing screen presence that he doesn't show anymore and I thought was really good. Harvey Keitel is always great in his more gruff roles, I thought he was terrific as the father of the distressed, kidnapped family. It's a bit of a different role and he did a very good job going back and forth with George Clooney. Salma Hayek, my goodness, no words can describe the spell I was in with her screen presence. It's not a groundbreaking role by any means, she's there mostly to look good and that she does. Tarantino has a larger than normal role, he was enjoyable as well, but his real contribution to this movie is his screenplay. The dialog is so spot on and really meshes perfectly with the more crime driven first half. Vampires are kind of a punchline in movies now a days, this film gives the fanged creatures a very good treatment. There's a lot of use practical effects and make-up, the vampires look creepy and demonic and the action is filmed well. There's a shot that stands out to me in the beginning, where Clooney and Tarantino are walking away from a gas station store engulfed in flames. It's one continuous shot, and as the actors are saying their lines, in the back you see flames spitting out and little explosions throwing debris everywhere, you can tell it was done on set, and I loved it. I loved the vampire twist at the end, but I will say that the horror element did kind of get me at a stand still moment, only because the way the movie started as this really intense crime thriller with these two brothers intrigued me. I would have liked to see them stretch on that further, but the insane second half still did it for me, it was a fun watch, and has officially became my favorite vampire movie of all time.

When the group get's to there destination, a shady little Mexican bar, all hell breaks loose when vampires turn out to run the place.It sounds corny, it sounds cheesy, campy, laughable, maybe a bit over the top, but BY THE NINE, this is not only a cool crime movie, not only is it a dark, creepy vampire movie, but this is a great movie in it's own right. It's so unique and good at how it tell's the story, and you gotta give major credit to director Robert Rodriguez, because the first half of the movie just feels like a dark, gritty, crime-thriller and if the movie would've just kept that tone through out I would've been perfectly fine, but once the setting jumps the fence into Mexico, a whole other level of a movie is unleashed. George Clooney gives one of my favorite performances I've seen from him, he has this menacing screen presence that he doesn't show anymore and I thought was really good. Harvey Keitel is always great in his more gruff roles, I thought he was terrific as the father of the distressed, kidnapped family. It's a bit of a different role and he did a very good job going back and forth with George Clooney. Salma Hayek, my goodness, no words can describe the spell I was in with her screen presence. It's not a groundbreaking role by any means, she's there mostly to look good and that she does. Tarantino has a larger than normal role, he was enjoyable as well, but his real contribution to this movie is his screenplay. The dialog is so spot on and really meshes perfectly with the more crime driven first half. Vampires are kind of a punchline in movies now a days, this film gives the fanged creatures a very good treatment. There's a lot of use practical effects and make-up, the vampires look creepy and demonic and the action is filmed well. There's a shot that stands out to me in the beginning, where Clooney and Tarantino are walking away from a gas station store engulfed in flames. It's one continuous shot, and as the actors are saying their lines, in the back you see flames spitting out and little explosions throwing debris everywhere, you can tell it was done on set, and I loved it. I loved the vampire twist at the end, but I will say that the horror element did kind of get me at a stand still moment, only because the way the movie started as this really intense crime thriller with these two brothers intrigued me. I would have liked to see them stretch on that further, but the insane second half still did it for me, it was a fun watch, and has officially became my favorite vampire movie of all time.

I've seen it many times since, and in my later views I really wanted to like it, but I ended up disliking it even more. The first sign of silliness in my eyes was the snow-speeders equipped with harpoons and towing cables. Why should anyone install a harpoon to a flying machine? It turns out to topple AT-ATs. But how did they know they'd fight against walking moto-quadrupeds? Well, they didn't. It dawned on me that that was nothing more than lazy storytelling. Create the outcome first (tackle walking machines), invent how to generate it (using cables) later. And do it again, this time with Luke.Why did Luke flee the cave into the cold snow storm instead of killing the wampa? Because he had to come to the brink of death. And why is that? Because just before passing out he needs to see Obi-Wan's ghost. And what's it doing there? Obi-Wan's spirit is there to tell Luke where to find Yoda. Sorry but this is nonsense. First, the flow of the story is backwards, because at the time Luke leaves the cave, he has no reason to do so; he should have killed the wampa and stayed inside. Second, this part of the story must be about setting our main character in motion. Luke needs a motivation to pursue his Jedi training. One may argue that this must be the natural outcome of the first film. But still, Mr Lucas owes the viewer a decent sequence showing how Luke discovers where Yoda lives. The way Luke is informed of Dagobah in TESB is simply bad storytelling.That also leads to a hollow first act. The action in there has nothing to do with Luke's storyline. The Battle of Hoth is completely pointless. The first act must be all about sending Luke to Dagobah. Luke will go there anyway with or without this useless battle. But instead of watching Luke discover Yoda and Dagobah, we have to watch some silly battle.As a consequence, we have a first act disjointed from the rest of the film. The action is isolated from, and not related to, the further events. You can start watching the film 35 minutes into it, when Luke gives R2 the coordinates of the Dagobah system. There's nothing that makes sense before, explaining why Luke wants to finish his training, or how he knows where to go. For further study, compare this to how the story unfolds in A New Hope.Things don't go well in the second act either. The story forks, and I have the feeling that Mr Lucas didn't know what to do with Han Solo and Leia, and decided to hide them inside the stomach of a giant space eel. Luke in Dagobah scenes don't fare better. Luke is a pilot and is supposed to be top physical form. Why all the physical training? And it contradicts with what Yoda says luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. Actually the problem is deeper. Jedi training is obviously not well thought of. It may look impressive on paper, with stream of consciousness and the like, but all we see on screen is a guy running with a backpack full of rocks, or trying to levitate things around him.The film is sort of alright 75 minutes into it, after Yoda moves Luke's X-wing out of the swamp. But not enough to make it more than 4 stars out of 10. Don't forget that some of the things the fans pan in Return of the Jedi and in the prequels are present in TESB some way, though not as pronounced as in the prequels. I have to come back to that but the first act of The Empire Strikes Back is a disaster. I've tried to make objective points anyone could check for themselves, you like this film or not.

And why did Margaret Crusemark and her father actually assist in this process, since we find out later that she hated Johnny Fortune? And why does she not recognise Harry Angel as being that soldier when they meet years later? So many questions, so many flaws, so fundamental that it forces you to watch the movie again and again to get to the truth, if there is one.If there is one thing I would criticise it is the unnecessarily gruesome way in which people die. Maybe it is true to the book, I don't know, but it adds nothing to the movie, and in fact quite the contrary, it jars badly with the standards you would expect in what is essentially a 1950s period piece.

Quite frankly the destination is a bunch of mumbo-jumbo that has plot holes big enough to drive an 18 wheeler through, but by that time we have been well satisfied and entertained by the ride to get there, so I for one am not complaining.I've watched this movie a few times now, first because it is so stylishly noir and evocative of a time and place and genre, and secondly because I really would like to get my brain around the actual premise of the diabolical transaction that took place. I really don't understand who or what Harry Angel is. His body is obviously not Johnny Fortune's, nor is it that of the original Harry Angel, the army guy who was butchered as part of the ceremony to transfer Johnny's soul. And why did Margaret Crusemark and her father actually assist in this process, since we find out later that she hated Johnny Fortune? And why does she not recognise Harry Angel as being that soldier when they meet years later? So many questions, so many flaws, so fundamental that it forces you to watch the movie again and again to get to the truth, if there is one.If there is one thing I would criticise it is the unnecessarily gruesome way in which people die. Maybe it is true to the book, I don't know, but it adds nothing to the movie, and in fact quite the contrary, it jars badly with the standards you would expect in what is essentially a 1950s period piece. For me the fact that people simply die is enough to tell the story, I don't need to know they had their genitals cut off, or whatever.I love the little extraneous details that are thrown in. Like when Harry greets an unknown girl on the sidewalk and asks if her new boyfriend really owns a car. We never see her again, and it adds nothing to the progress of the movie, yet it says so much about Harry as a person, as part of a community, and makes you care about him so much more.Much has been said about Robert de Niro's work, I agree it's fine, but really no more than you would expect. I loved his line the future isn't what it used to be. Who'd have thought the Devil could be a stand-up comedian.Mickey Rourke of course holds the whole thing together and he does a brilliant job of portraying a believable gumshoe doing the best he can, but for my money the best piece of acting comes from whoever plays the morphine addicted doctor.So a mixed bag here, a rough diamond, but with enough allure to make me watch it again and again, which I guess makes it a great movie.

This film really worked for me and the action engaged me in a way that I didn't feel worked all that well in his previous movie. I was only able to appreciate the technical aspects of Sherlock Jr. but didn't really care much for the story or the characters, but in The General I was hooked with Keaton's character and the action sequences really drew me into the story. There were some spectacular chases that were thrilling to watch and I was in disbelief that this film was directed nearly 90 years ago because it was beautifully shot and the effects looked believable. There was one scene where a train collapsed on a burning bridge that was gorgeously shot. Keaton not only had a talent for comedy, but he proved to be an action star as well. The General meshes these two genres together in an enriching manner allowing the audience to be laughing one moment and feeling thrilled the next. Based on true events that took place during the American Civil War, the screenplay was written by Clyde Bruckman and Buster Keaton. We are first introduced to the main protagonist, Johnny Gray (Buster Keaton) as a Southern railroad engineer. There are two things that he loves in life his train engine (The General) and Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack). When the Civil War breaks out, Annabelle's father and brother enlist as soldiers for the Confederate army, so Johnny also feels he should do the same. The officials consider he is more useful as an engineer so they don't allow him to enlist. Annabelle believes Johnny is a coward and is lying to her about not being allowed to enlist so she breaks up with him. Johnny continues working as an engineer, but when Union spies steal his beloved train and kidnap Annabelle, who happened to be riding The General that day, he does what is in his power to catch up with the spies and save the two things he loves the most in life. The film thus becomes a thrilling cat and mouse chase across the Southern railroads. Buster Keaton proved his unique talents in The General through his comedic performance and physical ability by doing all the stunts on his own. There are several great action scenes in this film and Keaton does some acrobatic stunts proving he deserves to be considered as an action star as well. I had a great time with this film and was completely entertained throughout its 105 minute runtime. It's one of the best films that have combined action with comedy from the silent era, and very few contemporary films do it as well as Keaton did way back in 1926. I'm on board with Keaton acknowledging this is his best film and really can't understand how it was a flop when it came out because The General was genius film making. Now justice has been made and it is considered amongst the best films of the silent era. If you haven't had the chance to see this film, you should because it is a thrill.

There I was, a young kid, sitting in my parents house on a cold bleak Saturday morning in Michigan. We had HBO back then so I turned on the cable box hoping to find something fun to watch (possible cartoons). As I was channel surfing, I came across a classic 70's disaster flick that remains to this day, one of my all time favorite films. The Towering Inferno is a tense, exciting, and flat out entertaining piece of cinema. It has popcorn flick written all over it. At 165 minutes, its got a long running time, but it doesn't feel that way. Inferno moves by at an unbelievably fast clip and its got a huge cast of stars who look as if they all had a lot of fun making it. Its also got special effects that even today would hold up against any lifeless Michael Bay production.Inferno came out during a wave of other disaster flicks like Earthquake (1974), The Poseidon Adventure (1972), and Airport (1970). Safe to say it's the best one of the bunch. It's truly one of the reasons I love watching movies as well as reviewing them.It tells the story of the world's tallest building (The Glass Tower) in San Francisco having an electrical short that starts a huge fire (81st floor). The fire quickly spreads threatening to kill everybody on the top floor (they're having a dedication ceremony\/party for the opening of the tower). With the help of a determined architect (Doug Roberts played by Paul Newman) and a fire department led by Chief Michael O'Hallorhan (Steve McQueen ), enormous efforts are made to try and stop the out of control blaze using any means necessary.The concept for The Towering Inferno was based on two novels, The Tower by Richard Martin Stern and The Glass Inferno by Thomas N. Scortia and Frank M. Robinson. And although the film is minimal on plot, it makes up with for it with relentless action and suspense. They didn't have PG-13 movies back then and this film really pushed the envelope for PG fare. Yes, there are death by fire scenes in the film that really shook me upon first viewing. But as I got older and viewed Inferno many times over, I realized that this was an important element in keeping the viewer clinging to the screen, helplessly wanted to know if the rest of the cast makes it out alive.Lets talk about that cast. We have William Holden as James Duncan (the builder), we got Fred Astaire as Harlee Claiborne (Astaire was nominated for best supporting actor by the Academy), we got Richard Chamberlain as Roger Simmons (the electrical engineer), and lets not forget former NFL running back O.J. Simpson as Harry Jernigan (Chief Security Officer). With his huge 70's afro and confident demeanor, he pioneered the whole athletes transitioning to acting thing. He gives a solid performance, unlike the forgettable ones he gave in the Naked Gun movies.All in all, The Towering Inferno is a bonified masterpiece. I normally don't say that a lot of films because I have been critical in the past with movies of this genre. Edited splendidly by Harold Kress and Carl Kress and directed with gusto by John Guillermin and Irwin Allen, Inferno has the real feel of a true Best Picture Nominee (it was in fact nominated at the 1975 academy awards). It also kind of serves secretly as a public announcement about the dangers of fire and fire prevention.Inferno is dangerous, epic, exhausting stuff and when it does move closer and closer to its conclusion, we get the pleasure of seeing two renegades (Newman and McQueen) come together to stop an out of control fire destroying everything in its path. I've gotta admit seeing these two Hollywood legends on screen gives me goosebumps. Oh heck, the whole film gives me goosebumps. If you love movies and want to escape, Inferno is pretty serviceable. Just get a big bucket of popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the ride.

There I was, a young kid, sitting in my parents house on a cold bleak Saturday morning in Michigan. We had HBO back then so I turned on the cable box hoping to find something fun to watch (possible cartoons). As I was channel surfing, I came across a classic 70's disaster flick that remains to this day, one of my all time favorite films. The Towering Inferno is a tense, exciting, and flat out entertaining piece of cinema. It has popcorn flick written all over it. At 165 minutes, its got a long running time, but it doesn't feel that way. Inferno moves by at an unbelievably fast clip and its got a huge cast of stars who look as if they all had a lot of fun making it. Its also got special effects that even today would hold up against any lifeless Michael Bay production.Inferno came out during a wave of other disaster flicks like Earthquake (1974), The Poseidon Adventure (1972), and Airport (1970). Safe to say it's the best one of the bunch. It's truly one of the reasons I love watching movies as well as reviewing them.It tells the story of the world's tallest building (The Glass Tower) in San Francisco having an electrical short that starts a huge fire (81st floor). The fire quickly spreads threatening to kill everybody on the top floor (they're having a dedication ceremony\/party for the opening of the tower). With the help of a determined architect (Doug Roberts played by Paul Newman) and a fire department led by Chief Michael O'Hallorhan (Steve McQueen ), enormous efforts are made to try and stop the out of control blaze using any means necessary.The concept for The Towering Inferno was based on two novels, The Tower by Richard Martin Stern and The Glass Inferno by Thomas N. Scortia and Frank M. Robinson. And although the film is minimal on plot, it makes up with for it with relentless action and suspense. They didn't have PG-13 movies back then and this film really pushed the envelope for PG fare. Yes, there are death by fire scenes in the film that really shook me upon first viewing. But as I got older and viewed Inferno many times over, I realized that this was an important element in keeping the viewer clinging to the screen, helplessly wanted to know if the rest of the cast makes it out alive.Lets talk about that cast. We have William Holden as James Duncan (the builder), we got Fred Astaire as Harlee Claiborne (Astaire was nominated for best supporting actor by the Academy), we got Richard Chamberlain as Roger Simmons (the electrical engineer), and lets not forget former NFL running back O.J. Simpson as Harry Jernigan (Chief Security Officer). With his huge 70's afro and confident demeanor, he pioneered the whole athletes transitioning to acting thing. He gives a solid performance, unlike the forgettable ones he gave in the Naked Gun movies.All in all, The Towering Inferno is a bonified masterpiece.

I only moved to Manhattan after graduating college, well into my adult life, and nothing about my life was remotely like the events in this film.Watching Kids was at once overwhelming and saddening. While I found it incredibly rich in entertainment value, I also felt deep pangs of terror for what might be happening to a pocket of American teenage society. With the advent of HIV+AIDS circulating the modern world, the lack of responsible parenting or other forms of positive role modeling, and youth's ignorance to safe sex practices due to an abundance of abstinence-only health programs or a lack of funding that would allow schools to provide free access to forms of birth control--everything has coalesced into the microcosm portrayed in this film. I don't think I know of any place in America, rural,suburban or urban, where parents are so dramatically unaware of the whereabouts and behavior of their children as they are in this film. It is just plain shocking. Also shocking was the opening scene, in which a, what, 13-year old, sleeps with a, what, 12-year-old? I mean I felt like i was watching kiddie porn, and even if it made sense in the context of the film, and was relevant to later scenes, that didn't stop it from being awkward and uncomfortable.All of this established, however, I do think Kids is a very stylistically successful film. The shots and acting are spot-on, so much so that one could not imagine these young actors and actresses having any alternate, real-life personas outside of their characters. Ten-year-olds getting high in a parentless apartment, talking about the quality of the weed they're smoking as though they were in their college years or late high school years--what does one even say to a scene like that? Newly acknowledged HIV-positivity of Chloe Sevigny's character--her subsequent getting high and showing up at a party and being more or less raped and unable to speak up and say a simple no, not to mention divulging her health condition to prevent the disease's spread. This communication never happens during the course of the film, and it is this lack of conclusiveness that rounds out an overall very dark depiction of teen recklessness and the spread of disease due to irresponsibility.Fun times!
