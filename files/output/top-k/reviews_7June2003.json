The action is mind blowing - both the gun fights and the long car chase - and it keeps you at the edge of your seat (literally) the whole time.The plot circles around five former agents (Robert De Niro, Jean Reno, Stellan Skarsgard, Sean Bean and Skip Sudduth) hired by a fine Irish lass to steal a case for her.  This case is very valuable to the characters, but still very mysterious because none know what's actually in it.

When I was a little kid, I was a dinosaur fanatic. My mom used to rent a dinosaur cartoon movie (made by some unknown studio) and I would watch it all the time. However, when that movie was unavailable for rental, my mom introduced Gojira to me. The film was titled Godzilla 1985 and understandably, as I didn't understand subtitles back then, it was the US version of the Japanese 1984 film (the one with Raymond Burr in it). Though I heard the original Japanese version contains numerous scenes that were cut from the US version, the US version is still pleasant to watch. I would never have thought that this movie would lead me into years of collecting Godzilla and other Toho sci-fi movies, and even soundtrack CDs. The video version of this movie I rented included the short Bambi Meets Godzilla cartoon. Poor Bambi!I think Shuichi Nagahara wrote a nice screenplay, depicting suspense, humor, power, and politics. Koji Hashimoto did a good job directing(keeping the plot intact), and Teruyoshi Nakano did great on the special effects (probably his best work). Reijiro Koroku provided a terrific music score, creating what I think is one of the best non-Ifukube scores.Even though this movie features Godzilla only, it remains one of my all-time favorites. The scenes of Godzilla rising out of Tokyo bay, rendering the military helpless, and causing a path of destruction in Tokyo as citizens run for their lives are powerful. The scene where Godzilla derails a train with people still in it is still appalling for me to watch. I used to fast-forward the sea louse scene, for it scared the heck out of me. Now, the scene it pretty tamed to watch. The part where Godzilla falls inside the volcano was sad to watch, and aroused my sympathy in the monster. When the character Professor Hayashida said that when mankind falls into conflict with nature, monsters are born, I think it is a really moral message (thinking back that it was nuclear bombs that brought Godzilla's wrath). And, the part where Burr said at the climax of the film that hints Godzilla is a natural force better explains Godzilla's purpose.Overall, a great way to revive the Godzilla series after a 9-year hiatus, and a great introduction to the Godzilla Heisei series, which ran from 1984-1995.

Sorry, but I'm afraid I detest screwball comedies possibly more than any other film genre.It doesn't quite qualify as for that category as it lacks pace and frantic urgency, but it still falls in the same ballpark of watered down vaudeville pitched solely at the lowest common denominator. There's a rule that says nothing dates faster than comedy, but I don't believe this is a universal truth.

It succeeds in every respect as a formulaic, jingoistic war movie - pushing all the scripted buttons in order - in a time when a love affair when all things military is in full swing. That said, it is an objectionably bad movie. In some ways we have Spielberg to blame. After the technically proficient but rather poorly written Saving Private Ryan, there was a surge in popularity for real war movies. Making a war movie became all about how gruesome one could make the battle scenes. The stories have all been on autopilot, the same ragtag bunch of misfits spouting heroic lines that have been pushed onto the silver screen since WWII. We Were Soldiers is a bad movie because it contains so little imagination, and although the battle scenes are sufficiently traumatic, the movie drags at all other times. It simply feels manipulative. From the Daddy, what's a war? moments in Mel Gibson's home to the scene where Randall Wallace speaks for the disenfranchised black man, it's just embarassing. Unfortunately for Wallace it all falls on him. Sure, Gibson is coasting, doing a bad American accent and his usual hard-swallowing, not-gonna-cry emoting. But the actors can't really be blamed it is what they are forced to say, and the way they are told to say it, that ruins this movie. It is also shameful the way Wallace wraps his movie in god-and-country symbolism. Lots of scenes in churches or of flags blowing triumphantly in the breeze. Numerous statements of purpose and valor. Men on their knees in churches asking the Almighty to smite their foe. Perhaps the most technically inept of Wallace's numerous trip-ups is the repeated use of an annoying Scottish lament, which most viewers have come to know as the Lay Me Doon song. It consists of mournful Scottish music and a Scotsman repeating over and over, Lay Meeee Dooooon ... In the cooold coold grooond ... It is unintentionally hilarious, mostly because he uses it like ten times. I'm certain that it is technically and factually accurate, as far as the events go (something they brag about in a separate movie). One thing I can commend Wallace for is showing the folly of going back for a wounded friend - every time someone screams Frank, noooo! and goes back to pick up his buddy, you know he's done for. But as far as entertainment goes, it could have been pulled out of a WWII time capsule. It's propaganda, and poorly-written propaganda at that. Good propaganda doesn't let you know when you are being manipulated. Here we feel the strings tugging at all times.

So i have to thank it, even though it twisted the story beyond recognition.But to tell you guys the truth, i wasnt a big fan of the book. In fact, its my least favorite book in the entire series.

To be quite honest with you, i dont care about Khayman, or many of the others.Im all for Lestat , as im sure many of the fans are. The one thing that toasted me about the movie was that they fused two characters. Yes, you know what im talking about all you readers. Marius and Magnus were made into one person.Another thing is, how hard would it have been to dye their hair blonde? Marius was supposed to have long beautiful straight blonde hair, and Lestats was to be a wavey gold. Also i think they shouldve expanded on the story with the twins past with akasha and enkil. But to tell you the truth, that bored me too.People were also complaining about stuart townsend. Frankly , i like the guy. And despite other comments about Tom Cruise, i liked him as Lestat too. To be perfectly honest, ive not seen an actor who looks like i imagined my Lestat.To finish this off, i'd like to say that no one even heard about this movie coming out until Aaliyah died. I was knee deep in a conversation with a relative of mine how they thought it was 'manipulative of hollywood to put it out and milk on peoples sympathy for her death'. I didnt see it that way at all.If she took the time from her busy schedule (and you know it was busy), and wanted to do the movie, she wouldve wanted it to be put out into the public. It was low budget, i assume (by costuming), so theres no doubt that someone had offered her other parts for more money.And it was a laid back flick with all good elements.

The one thing that toasted me about the movie was that they fused two characters. Yes, you know what im talking about all you readers. Marius and Magnus were made into one person.Another thing is, how hard would it have been to dye their hair blonde? Marius was supposed to have long beautiful straight blonde hair, and Lestats was to be a wavey gold. Also i think they shouldve expanded on the story with the twins past with akasha and enkil. But to tell you the truth, that bored me too.People were also complaining about stuart townsend. Frankly , i like the guy. And despite other comments about Tom Cruise, i liked him as Lestat too. To be perfectly honest, ive not seen an actor who looks like i imagined my Lestat.To finish this off, i'd like to say that no one even heard about this movie coming out until Aaliyah died. I was knee deep in a conversation with a relative of mine how they thought it was 'manipulative of hollywood to put it out and milk on peoples sympathy for her death'. I didnt see it that way at all.If she took the time from her busy schedule (and you know it was busy), and wanted to do the movie, she wouldve wanted it to be put out into the public. It was low budget, i assume (by costuming), so theres no doubt that someone had offered her other parts for more money.And it was a laid back flick with all good elements.

I probably wouldnt have given in a second look had i read the book before i saw it, but i didnt. In fact, i hadnt read any of the vampire books. That was the movie that put me through the series. So i have to thank it, even though it twisted the story beyond recognition.But to tell you guys the truth, i wasnt a big fan of the book. In fact, its my least favorite book in the entire series.

It's supposed to be Shakespeare, but it ends up being badly made, girls are supposed to be this way teenage drama. The entire thing is one pretentious cliche. While I appreciate films like Hobgoblins (1987) for their campiness, this film really seems to try and say something.  I mean, that's why I hate it so much.  I can think up 10 things that I hate about this movie.1.  Julia Stiles - supposed to come off as some feminist boy-hater, comes off as just whiny.  That's it.  Her acting isn't very good.  I'm sorry. 2.  The Shakespeare scene in the High School.  It was like a cinematic version of Saved by the Bell. 3.  The parents' rule - who would, in their right mind, prevent one of their girls from dating because the other one won't date anybody?  What?  What if Kat was a lesbian? Then her sister would never date anyone. 4.  The examples for teenage girls.  You're not anybody unless you date anybody. 5.  The whole macho bribe thing.  I'll bribe you to date her.  How offensive to women. 6.  The headache that it gave me. 7.  The way that it depicts youth as an MTV culture.  Young life for some people is alienated and depressing.  Not a 24\/7 party. 8.  The fact that only beautiful people exist in this movie's world.  If this movie had the characters from Gummo in it, I would have appreciated it more. 9.  The dull cinematography. 10.  The way that it vomits on Shakespeare's grave in a late 90's drunken stupor.All in all, this film should be reviewed by some future Mystery Science Theater 3000 show.... they could have a field day with it.  1\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"7 June 2003","score":"7 out of 16 people found the following review useful","review":"  I have a long running dislike for this film.

He made The Terminator in 1984, which is not only Arnold Schwarzenegger's best film, but quite simply the greatest action film ever made.  Aliens and The Abyss were excellent sci-fi films and literally invented new technology.  Terminator 2 was a great sequel, and True Lies was a ton of fun.  He also made T2-3D, a cool theme park attraction.Then he made Titanic.  T2 was the most expensive film of its time at a hundred million dollars.  Titanic more than doubled that.  It went far over budget, in fact.  And it was well spent.  The special effects are absolutely incredible.Cameron's script, however, leaves something to be desired.  It concerns unsatisfied 1st class 16-year-old Rose (Kate Capshaw) and her romance with 3rd class con guy Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio).  His profession wander around Paris, France drawing girls naked.  Here is problem #1.(WARNING minor but predictable spoiler)  In 1912, a 1st class teenaged girl sleeps with a 3rd class teen 24 hours after they meet.  Maybe, *maybe* in the  80s, but in 1912?In fact, that's the main problem.  The film revolves around a romance that is stupid and completely unbelievable.  In other words, the script stinks.The film lasts over three hours.  This is not necessarily a bad thing. All of Sergio Leone's classics last about that long.  But in Titanic, the hours are divided up in different qualities.  The first hour is fine and somewhat spectacular but not great.  The second is really stupid and ruins the film.  The last hour is superb in nearly every way.  As I have already mentioned, the special effects are awesome, and Cameron's directing abilities are at their very best.The cast is fine but not great.  I've never been much of a fan of DiCaprio, but he's okay here.  Capshaw is really good, but is outdone by Billy Zane as her slimy fiancee.This won eleven Academy Awards, which has only been done once before, for 1959's Ben Hur.  Ben Hur was a true classic, and deserved it.Titanic won Best Picture, which should have gone to LA Confidential. Best Director was more or less deserved for helming something on this scale. The special effects, sets, cinematography, costumes, etc. definitely deserved it.  James Horner's score was good, but it did not deserve and Oscar as much as some of his others, like Glory and Star Trek II.  And surely this wasn't the best film song of the year.As I said in the one-line-summary, it is Cameron's worst so far... but that's not really that bad.  Steven Spielburg has made worse than this.It might not be a bad idea to see this film just for the spectacle. I just can't think of any other reason.
