Don't get me wrong, it's no where near as brilliant as Scream, but still entertaining and definitely better than all those other slashers (we all know what they are). The script was written by Kevin Williamson who is also the author behind Scream. I thought it was cool that right after Williamson wrote Scream he wrote a horror flick just like the ones he parodies in Scream. Williamson is one hell of a writer. His characters are fun, his dialogue sounds right and he sure knows how scare the crap out of you.The motive of the killer is not that brilliant (but than again, they never are). The film gets pretty interesting once the slasher-action starts. The suspense is great and there are several scenes that made me jump. The mystery part of the film kept me involved also and it was fun trying to solve. The film also delivers some very creative death scenes that are truly enjoyable and different from the death scenes in other 90s slasher films.The acting was pretty good (for a horror film). Jennifer Love Hewitt was good at playing the helpless victim. 'Cause, I guess, she can scream good. Sarah Michelle Gellar is a little better than Jennifer. Mostly because she has the privilege of being in the most thrilling scene in the movie. Ryan Phillippe is good at playing the jerk\/jock type. I thought he was good in the film, but Freddie Prinze Jr. was really bad in the film. I wont even go there, because we all know about him already.Beside Scream, this is the only 90s (and beyond) teen-horror flick that is really entertaining and (at least partly) inventive.

As if making it in the world of the late 80's American zeitgeist while dealing with girls and evil rabbits weren't enough, he also has to deal with self-help gurus, terrorist classmates and seeing Katherine Ross as a middle aged therapist (middle-aged being a polite term for frightfully older). DONNIE DARKO is a film that will have trouble finding an audience because it challenges them with both a mentally disturbed protagonist and the big boogieman of studio zipperheads - the ambiguous ending (...audience because it challenges them... being a polite way to suggest that fans of Touched By An Angel are likely to be confused  by it). DARKO is a thought provoking film that joins MEMENTO on the too short list of smart and entertaining films released this year.What's new about this story, besides the Harvey-as-the-Terminator, is that writer and director Richard Kelly sets DARKO in the last months of the Reagan Era, October 1988. George Bush (the original, not the sequel) is seen making some later to be embarrassing debate statements about his good friend Manuel in Panama who couldn't possibly be involved with drugs and money laundering. While it does have the de rigueur period soundtrack and cultural icon references, Kelly does his best to keep them in the background. So, even though Tears For Fears provides the music for a montage and the now forgotten children's game of Hungry, Hungry Hippos is the punchline to a therapy session, the kids attend a private school that thus keeps the clothes and hairstyles subdued. In fact, probably the most remarkable thing about DARKO is how tightly Kelly keeps both the overall tone and his protagonist's performance reined in to maintain a restrained quality to them.The Donnie Darko of DONNIE DARKO is very much, without-a-doubt slipping into dementia. There are no coy games being played here as in K-PAX of whether or not Donnie is seeing the things he thinks he is seeing. By not giving in to the Hollywood impulse of having the mentally disturbed character either capable of incredible human insight that has him tossing off bon mots of wisdom or a cute crackpot who says funny nonsensical non sequiturs, DARKO allows for something much more human. And unpredictable, which becomes the source of DARKO's tension. As likeable as Donnie is, there is always the foreboding sense that he is liable to really go off the deep end any moment. Given the countdown gimmick in the film, it is inevitable that something is going to happen. Which is to say, Kelly has a lot riding on the actor inhabiting the title character.Seldom do performances deserve the heaps of praise they are swathed with, the part being so showy that the appraisers confuse the uniqueness of the character with the gifts of the actor (Dustin Hoffman in RAINMAN or Al Pacino in SCENT OF A WOMAN just to name two Academy Award winning ham-fests). This has less to do with the actual performance than the reviewers desire to be the one to find the next Brando. Much harder to appreciate is the skill to pull off a nuanced character who manages to emote on a broad range with subtle shadings. Being able to do this while portraying a mentally disturbed boy without resorting to scenery-chewing histrionics is a rare feat and Jake Gyllenhaal should be on the very very short list of noteworthy performances this year for doing it. Two years ago he showed his chops in his first starring role in OCTOBER SKY and DARKO confirms that that performance was no lucky fluke. If the part was bigger, Drew Barrymore would also deserve any awards she will probably garner for what is arguably her first real adult role of the English teacher Ms. Pomeroy.The young-bold-teacher-with-radical-new-ideas is not exactly a cinema first, but Barrymore plays it so completely free of inappropriately ennobling tics that it seems fresh. It's not so much the part but that it is Barrymore playing it that the surprise here. Another former child actress moving to older parts is Jena Malone, most recognizable from STEPMOM. As the love interest, she does a lot with the little time Kelly allows for her. Looking down the road, it is easy to see Malone segueing to leading lady roles. This is not to suggest that the rest of the cast is dogmeat for all do more than well enough. One of the few stumbles that Kelly makes is Kittie Farmer (Beth Grant) a preachy teacher and book banner who is at first blush a cliché. At one point she wears a very 80's religiously sloganed t-shirt. But surrounded by such unique characters Farmer comes across like people who do in fact act like clichés.A lot of the film's strength comes from the fact that these characters surrounding Donnie are given a real human depth, most notably the Darko parents who are given the rare-for-fictional-parents facet of unique senses of humor. Unlike other Hollywood worlds where the parents are portrayed as the likely source of a disturbed child's mental illness, the Darkos are seen as real people doing what they can to help their son. There's a pathos to this depiction of the realistic randomness of dementia. All of which goes towards making DONNIE DARKO one of the original gems of filmmaking to come out this year. It is not a perfect film, having an awkward third act deus ex machina and developments that hint too strongly towards a supernaturalism that is out of place. But these are minor complaints for such a unique film.

Unlike other Hollywood worlds where the parents are portrayed as the likely source of a disturbed child's mental illness, the Darkos are seen as real people doing what they can to help their son. There's a pathos to this depiction of the realistic randomness of dementia. All of which goes towards making DONNIE DARKO one of the original gems of filmmaking to come out this year. It is not a perfect film, having an awkward third act deus ex machina and developments that hint too strongly towards a supernaturalism that is out of place.

","genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"3 November 2001","score":"","review":"  THE BULLET AND THE BOTTOM LINE - this is the usual run-of-the-mill boy meets girl, boy falls for girl, boy introduces girl to his imaginary 6 foot tall evil rabbit buddy with a metallic skull-like mask. As if making it in the world of the late 80's American zeitgeist while dealing with girls and evil rabbits weren't enough, he also has to deal with self-help gurus, terrorist classmates and seeing Katherine Ross as a middle aged therapist (middle-aged being a polite term for frightfully older). DONNIE DARKO is a film that will have trouble finding an audience because it challenges them with both a mentally disturbed protagonist and the big boogieman of studio zipperheads - the ambiguous ending (...audience because it challenges them... being a polite way to suggest that fans of Touched By An Angel are likely to be confused  by it). DARKO is a thought provoking film that joins MEMENTO on the too short list of smart and entertaining films released this year.What's new about this story, besides the Harvey-as-the-Terminator, is that writer and director Richard Kelly sets DARKO in the last months of the Reagan Era, October 1988. George Bush (the original, not the sequel) is seen making some later to be embarrassing debate statements about his good friend Manuel in Panama who couldn't possibly be involved with drugs and money laundering. While it does have the de rigueur period soundtrack and cultural icon references, Kelly does his best to keep them in the background. So, even though Tears For Fears provides the music for a montage and the now forgotten children's game of Hungry, Hungry Hippos is the punchline to a therapy session, the kids attend a private school that thus keeps the clothes and hairstyles subdued. In fact, probably the most remarkable thing about DARKO is how tightly Kelly keeps both the overall tone and his protagonist's performance reined in to maintain a restrained quality to them.The Donnie Darko of DONNIE DARKO is very much, without-a-doubt slipping into dementia. There are no coy games being played here as in K-PAX of whether or not Donnie is seeing the things he thinks he is seeing. By not giving in to the Hollywood impulse of having the mentally disturbed character either capable of incredible human insight that has him tossing off bon mots of wisdom or a cute crackpot who says funny nonsensical non sequiturs, DARKO allows for something much more human. And unpredictable, which becomes the source of DARKO's tension. As likeable as Donnie is, there is always the foreboding sense that he is liable to really go off the deep end any moment. Given the countdown gimmick in the film, it is inevitable that something is going to happen. Which is to say, Kelly has a lot riding on the actor inhabiting the title character.Seldom do performances deserve the heaps of praise they are swathed with, the part being so showy that the appraisers confuse the uniqueness of the character with the gifts of the actor (Dustin Hoffman in RAINMAN or Al Pacino in SCENT OF A WOMAN just to name two Academy Award winning ham-fests). This has less to do with the actual performance than the reviewers desire to be the one to find the next Brando.

This movie is not clever, it is not even interesting and trying to pass it off as 'art' is laughable. A few attractive images do not make a movie. The characters are not convincing and apparently have no direction. Whoever thinks Naomi Watts deserves an Oscar needs to realize that she should go to acting school first.The first half hour was so slow moving that I lost all interest in the characters and only stayed because after hearing all this garbage about what a great film it was I felt I needed to see the ending. I figured there had to be some sort of resolution. WRONG! The last hour of the movie derails completely and I wish I just would've followed the other patrons and walked out. Watching bad movies is a hobby of mine, but usually those movies are low budget horror flicks and they are supposed to be bad &#150; perhaps that's why they are more entertaining than this disaster of a film. Thankfully I was able to convince the theater manager to give me a refund.Mulholland Drive is nothing more than Lynch's half-baked notions about the dark side of Hollywood and after watching several of his films I am convinced the man cannot tell a story to save his life. He does not have the gift to make a worthwhile film. Do not watch this movie before operating heavy machinery. I would give it a &#150;3 if I could.

What makes this film interesting and noteworthy is the beautiful southern backdrop, abrim with Spanish moss, full moons and photogenic bayous; the quietly matter-of-fact handling of one woman's extrasensory abilities; a sterling cast rising to the occasion by instilling a level of truth and integrity to their performances. Cate Blanchett, at the helm of this remarkable ensemble, is soft-spoken and restrained as Annie, whose 'gift' suddenly immerses her into the vortex of a dark and dangerous place, which she confronts with rectitude, compassion, and courage (arguably foolishly or not). Keanu Reeves is appropriately menacing and despicable as the villain of the piece (I'd be surprised if he didn't base his character on DeNiro in 'Cape Fear'), unleashing his rage most frequently on his hapless wife, portrayed by Hillary Swank with wide-eyed, bayou-backward conviction. Greg Kinnear, quickly becoming one of my favorite actors of this era, professionally fleshes out a somewhat thankless role with warmth and sad-eyed sincerity. That the victim of the story (lustily played by Katie Holmes) is a debutante-harlot seems somewhat misogynistic (the implication being that she got what she deserved), and it is my only real qualm with the movie. Most astonishing, however, is Giovanni Ribisi's amazing portrayal of the psychologically disturbed Buddy, who seeks advice and redemption from Annie, and whose torment and anguish in the face of his inner demons is palpable. It is a richly textured and heartbreaking performance, and should have certainly earned Ribisi an Oscar nomination. Mostly because of the script, 'The Gift' is not a great film, but earns high marks for sharp direction, superb acting, and lovely cinematography. And, oh yes . . . there are genuinely creepy moments that will chill and startle and leave your heart racing. But, significantly, those moments are not gratuitous, and are for the most part necessary to the story line. My rating--8 out of 10.

I found it the funniest film I have ever seen.  I was literally hanging off the edge of my seat, holding my stomach, hoping I wouldn't follow through.  The way in which the characters deal with events is driven by such desperate, sweat dripping anxiety that you can't help but get emotionally involved with each individual character.The films plotline is basically about a group of guys in their thirties, who decide to have an all out entertaining 'Stag do' in Viva Las Vegas.  They leave their wives and children behind, to embark on a journey of adventure, free from the tyranny of everday life.  Importantly, it is obvious that all the guys are pretty stressed out with their lives and are in need of freedom and exilleration.....all but one Robert Boyd ( Christian Slater ) who is laid back and methodical in his thoughts.The guys end up having the time of their lives in a hotel room, deeply enjoying simultaneous hits, from all the temptations that surround them. Although everything is about to change for the worst as the call girl who was entertaining them, accidently gets killed.  The guys are thrown into despair and become hysterical.  Boyd is the only one calm and quickly begins to be ascertive,evaluating the situation as ''...a 105 pound problem''. Which means only one option is available, disposal of the body.From here on in, the film is launched into multiple body count territory, making me laugh longer and harder.  Daniel Stern is the main reason for this because it has to be his best comedic performance yet.  Watching him filled with paranoia, fearing everyone knows what he's done, is just delightful to see.  It really raises the question of what would you do in their situation.Do not be diswayed by the films very poor box office takings.  This is purely another cliched overlooked comedy classic, that unfortunately doesn't appeal to most.  Maybe I do love violence, maybe I have got a sick sense of humour but it's never stopped me recommending this film to everyone I know.Even though I rarely rate a film 10\/10 and only masterpieces such as The Shawshank Redemption, are worthy... I don't hesitate to give 10\/10, if only for sheer entertainment value alone.In summary, despite being totally over the top, extremely violent and not to mention the constant display of body dismemberment, there are notably fine performances and an evidently fine script.Could anyone out there let me know if this has been released on DVD...I can't find it anywhere!
