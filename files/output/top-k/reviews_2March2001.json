The cards, the films, the merchandise, the '60's series repeats - I loved it all. 'Batman' (1989) was pretty cool, I thought, but I loved 'Batman Returns' (1992) even better. It's my favorite of the Batman films, and one of my all-time faves.Tim Burton (the director of the first two movies) and Michael Keaton (who played Bruce Wayne\/Batman in the first two) had hit upon a winning formula, so when time came for the third installment, titled 'Batman Forever' I was a little worried. Why? It had a new director, Joel Schumacher (From Dusk Til Dawn), a new Batman (Val Kilmer) and a whole-new look.What I was excited about was the addition of Robin. Chris O'Donnell (Vertical Limit) plays Dick Grayson pretty well, but I think he is more suited to roles like the one he portayed in 'The Bachelor'. 2 new, cool baddies Harvey Dent, or Two-Face (Tommy-Lee Jones - and I won't go into all the movies he's made...) and Edward Nygma (funny-man Jim Carrey, 'Ace Ventura', 'The Mask', 'Dumb And Dumber') who's alter-ego, The (very eccentric) Riddler, is one of the best points of the film.Also stars Drew Barrymore as Sugar, the nice side of Two-Face, and Nicole Kidman as the sexy psychiatrist Dr. Chase Meridian. Michael Gough, the wise-cracking Alfred, Bruces' butler also returns for the 3rd time.The film also has a brilliant soundtrack album and features hit songs by the likes of Brandy, The Offspring and others. It also includes the #1 US 1995 single 'Kiss From A Rose' by Seal.The special FX are really quite cool, and the stunts are fun to watch. Not as violent or dark and gloomy as the previous two - more like it's been aimed at recruiting  a younger audience.

Based on Mario Puzo's popular novel, The Godfather tells the epic tale of Don Vito Corleone, one of the five chiefs of the Sicilian Mafia in New York. Don Vito (Marlon Brando) has three sons; Santino (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino). On the day of Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding, Michael, fresh out of the army and of the second World War, comes back to his family for the first time in a while. Michael's girlfriend, Kay, is introduced to the family and to the friends of the family; Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the consigliori, Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the caporegime, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana), the most feared hitman in New York and the godson himself and the freakishly Frank Sinatra-ish Johnny Fontane (Al Martini). I'm afraid to reveal more of this beautifully crafted plot. I read the book before, and I must say that Francis Ford Coppola (working with the author of the book, Mario Puzo) has left very little out. A few minor subplots were eliminated, a couple of things reworked, but as a whole you have a package that respects the original work.What gets me in this film is the attention to detail. The locations are stunning and this is truly what I had in mind while reading the book. But what I mean by detail is that everything that should recreate the New York of the 1940's is there, everything that represents the Sicilian frame of mind (?) is here in vivid recreation. The acting is also phenomenal. There's no denying that Marlon Brando is one of the greatest actors who ever lived, but you can't prove that without seeing The Godfather. Brando was 51 when he made this film, but makes it look like he is really older than that. His raspy voice, his pitbull-like appearance, the way he moves around clumsily... Students must study this performance because this is a landmark of film. But that's not to say this is a Brando vehicle. Al Pacino, who was revealed by this movie, is absolutely flawless. I don't think he's been this good ever since, except maybe in Part II and III and possibly Scent Of A Woman. (Long shot.) I think Pacino deserved the Best Supporting Actor Oscar more than Joel Grey. (Who?) Also, Robert Duvall shows us that he's always been bald. Hell, he's probably born bald. (Ehm. I know... we're all born bald. I'm making a point here.) Seriously, Duvall is fine here, as always.There are dozens of great scenes in here; the opening scene, the horse head in a bed scene, the coldly calculated mass murder at the end. There's some excellent dialogue and highly quotable material. This is the stuff legends are made from. If you haven't seen this, buy it. Don't rent it, buy it. Truly the best American film ever. 10\/10Note The VHS version with the yellow\/gold cover has 10 minutes of interviews with the cast. While this is interesting, I recommend you save it for after the film if you have never seen it because it contains a LOT of spoilers.

No, it is not because it is the most shocking or original film ever made (as if there could be).  In 40 years, the film has lost much of what made it revolutionary in 1960.  It is simply a fantastic screenplay that keeps me on the edge of my seat at all times.This is Hitchcock's best work as a director in my opinion.  Though he rarely made a bad film, most of Hitch's films are commercially-directed. I think of North By Northwest, Suspicion, Notorious and The Man Who Knew Too Much as examples.  Though each is a fantastic film, they are not terribly stimulating too watch and have minimal artistic merit.  Psycho, by contrast, is a true work of art.  No one could have expected it to be a hit at the time and was a great departure from Hitch's 1950s films.  There are no Cary Grants or Jimmy Stewarts here.  Just minor stars like Anthony Perkins and Martin Balsam.The two aspects of Psycho that set it apart are its cinematography and score.  There are no panoramic views typical of great cinematographic works. In fact, the whole film has the feel of a B movie.  One need only watch the famous shower scene to understand what I am talking about.  It is perhaps the most breathtaking 2 minutes ever put to film.  Hitch's close up shot of Marion's eye is still jolting today.  Imagine watching the scene on the big screen in 1960!  I guess what truly sets this film apart is the score. Perhaps no film is as tied to its score.  Bernard Herrmann may be the best there ever was at his profession.  His scores for Vertigo and Marnie are also top notch.Just watch this film.  If you've never seen it, it will provide a unique and surprising experience.  If you've already seen it, watch it again and enjoy Hitch at his best!

Take one skint shop assistant, two sexy gay soap studs trying to get out of a possession charge, and a dumb-ass English guy on a road trip to Las Vegas. Then throw in a stripjoint, a Las Vegas wedding chapel, an annoyed drug dealer, a worried best friend, a third gay guy screwing around the first two and running someone over. Add a pinches of a two very sexy cars, a bloody top soundtrack and a rave and you have Go. Its violent, its funny and that only works to its advantage. You'll laugh, you'll cry (with laughter) and then you'll laugh some more. While falling off your seat cos of the suspense. The best story is definitely Ronna's, its really obvious that this was originally a short and the others were added in as fillers, but they're almost as good. The car chase in Simons story is great (and so is Simon, hes so idiotic its funny), and Zack and Adams story isn't as action packed but makes up for it in humour.

These are just the standouts of a truly classic exercise in movie-making.  A subtle, chilling biopic of Charles Starkweather, this is about as hip as movies get, but also has that strange old-fashioned feel to it.  The films it has inspired, try to hard to be hip, this just is.  Sheen and Spacek have never been better, Malick will never do better and no matter how many times he copies it neither will Tarantino. Probably second only to Apocalypse Now in the photographic beauty stakes, forget renting it, go out and buy it NOW!
