Well, if you're like any normal person, you'd answer it. How do you form romantic chemistry between two characters in a movie? If there isn't already dramatic fire when you look at two characters, then you have to form it will dialogue.In the new romantic drama Message in a Bottle, all that the two main love birds do is ask each other and respond to questions. They meet when a Chicago newspaper worker named Theresa finds a bottled up note on the shore while jogging. She becomes curious as her friends find more evidence leading to this man that she deeply wants to meet. When she does meet him, a boat worker named Garret Blake, (hey, Blake is my first name, isn't that neat) romantic music instantly surrounds them. And the questioning begins.Theresa asks Garret many questions, but all Mr. Blake does is answer. Is that a bad thing? Not really, but when a movie is trying to form romance chemistry, well, this is not the way to do it. The only character who seems to be at all alive here is Paul Newman, as Blake's father, who masters every scene he is in. \tThe scenery in Message in a Bottle is absolutely stunning. From the busy landscape of Chicago to the blue sea waters and crystal clear waves. This kind of material sweeps me away every time I see it in the movies. I would compare this film to the beautiful Montana countryside's in  The Horse Whisperer, one of the best movies of 1998. \tThe performances in this film are mostly quite good, but none are Academy Award material. Robin Wright Penn is realistic and well-casted. She uses confusion and sorrow to build up momentum for the Costner character. As for Costner himself, however, he is surprisingly bad. I mean, just recovering over last year's The Postman, this man should be rebuilding his career, not destroying it even more. He gives another Waterworld type of performance, acting dumfounded throughout most of the film. It's Paul Newman who is the real surprise. He adds comic relief from all the ineffective melodrama which permits most of the movie. The characters themselves are indeed likeable. Some are a bit stubborn and bull-headed, others are freewheeling and care-free. This is okay because variety is good, you know. I liked Newman the most, but Robin Wright Penn is right up there with him.A major flaw in the film, however, is the ending, which is completely out of place and disappointing. I have nothing against this type of closing, but I have already seen this in material in last years City of Angels, sorry if that gives anything away.

Hollywood didn't let us down in one of it's early successes in bringing an array of major Stars together, all of them put aside their egos and percieved star billings and did justice to a great story. Gregory Peck's role of Jim McKay, the newly retired pragmatic Sea Captain was made for him. We see Peck as most of us have witnessed and  enjoyed over the years, quietly doing his own thing, resisting the baddies and getting his point across his way. Charlton Heston's role as the loyal but beleaguered Foreman, Steve Leech, must have had him thinking before accepting the part knowing there were a few around him who had meatier characters to play, but as always gave a reliable performance free of wooden expression we occasionly see in his roles. Jean Simmons as the demure Julie Maragon and Carol Baker as the tempestuous Patricia Terrill were characters suited to them both, especially Baker parading her talents to the three men in her life, McKay, Leech and her Father, Major Henry Terrill, played perfectly by Charles Bickford. The best performances came, I believe from Chuck Connors as the angry Buck Hannassey and Burl Ives playing his Father Rufus Hannassey. The scheming wayward Son was played cleverly by Connors as he snivelled his way through out the Movie until he finally meets his match via his Father. Burl Ives, like the Academy Awards suggests was brilliant! My favourite scene is when he came unannounced to the Major's home while the Terrill family were celebrating Patricia's home coming and impending marriage to Jim McKay. The interaction between them all is magic. The frustrated uninvited guest invites the Major to pick up the gun he has thrown across the room at him, the Major doesn't respond....there's too much to lose here... the defiant Daughter is hoping her Father would respond, the Foreman, ever eager to shield his Boss is restrained, sympathetic looks come from Miss Maragon and the Sea Captain is maybe starting to work out just who are the bad guys. Good stuff!!  The Big Country is a great movie,  is well directed and has a cast of Stars that compliment their characters and the story. I rank it a step away from The Searchers and that all time classic, Shane.

The Red American Beauty Rose, an apt symbol for this film of deep emotions. Some films have an interesting beginning or ending with not much in the middle -- this film has it all! Narration in a film rarely works for me because I have found it is usually a cover up for a poor script or story.  Here, narration does work for me (as it does in the classic, Sunset Boulevard, worthy of comparison).  Through the initial narration and a preview of a scene that is shown more fully later, we learn early that our main character will be dead in less than a year (or in 122 minutes, depending on whether you are in real time or movie time).  It is appropriate that we know this because the comedy is so masterful, we might be tricked into thinking it is a comedy with perhaps some pathos.  It is a movie which cuts across genres.The foundation for the film is an intelligent, courageous script (thanks, Alan Bail) which was turned over to masterful direction (Sam Mendes ) and acting.  I noticed and appreciated the crafting of little details, such as making Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) look small and lost in an office as he faces the potential of losing his job; red American Beauty Roses and rose petals carefully placed throughout; and varied  settings\/backgrounds that were perfectly suited to the individual personalities.  It explores ordinary people somewhat reminiscent of Ordinary People and shows us intertwined neighborhood families somewhat similar to Ice Storm. The story takes place in an unnamed suburban town, which seems appropriate as this film does not need another character.  We are taken into the intimate lives of nearly a dozen characters, each with different relationships.  Each phrase, each action, each scene tells us about these characters and their  relationships, while conveying several interwoven stories.   I can only speculate at the many scenes that must have been written and eliminated in order to create the script that told so much.   I found the sexual fantasy scenes to be very original, and the pacing to be steady.    Kevin Spacey is nothing short of brilliant, with his expressions of a full range of emotions, giving us Lester Burnham, an original character.  He changes in many ways through this film; I especially appreciate the change that is shown in is face and actions and but a few words in the last scene with Angela (Mena Suvari), his teenage daughter's girlfriend.  Carolyn Burnham is also a distinct character  (Annette Bening, who did not look or sound anything like Sydney Ellen Wade in one of my all-time favorite films, The American President).   Ricky's father is played eloquently by Chris Cooper, one of my favorite character actors.  These three actors I have seen in many different roles  I say this is acting at its best -- unlike so many popular stars who play the same character again and again.   I also want to applaud the work of the three teenagers.  The young women (Thora Birch  and Mena Suvari) were believable and poignant.  The 18-year old neighbor Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) is wise beyond his years.  The insights written into his dialogue seemed perfectly placed, as he is the one who sees the world through the eyes of a photographer. I highly recommend this as one of the finest films of the year and beyond.  It is deep, likely to make a lasting impression.

Some filmmakers have tried to do the two-teenagers-sucked-into-a-TV-show movie before and failed (miserably), Stay Tuned being a horrific example.  So when I started to watch the film, I was interested because it it's quite a gripping theory, but I was apprehensive about the way it would be handled.Happily, the film manages more-or-less to fall into the category of a successful teenagers-sucked-into-a-TV-show movie.  The performances by all are good (but a special mention must go to Joan Allen for a wonderful display of talent as the repressed housewife who discovers the beauty of life, love and the female orgasm Oh my goodness!), and a great deal of attention has gone into the set and props to make them authentic for the period in which the TV show Pleasantville is set.  On a negative note though, the camerawork just isn't authentic for a fifties TV show - normally, this wouldn't have bothered me much, but as I had just finished watching and reviewing The Elephant Man (which makes good use of camerawork in just this manner), I was aware of it.The use of colour is very well done, and the concept of people being susceptible to colourisation when they become passionate (for whatever reason) is simple, clever and competently exercised.  There are also certain points in the film which create quite surprising reactions in the audience for example, a friend of mine described the scene in which Joan Allen uses grey make-up to conceal her colour as very sad - and she was right.  At face value, there is little that is moving about the scene, (it is perhaps almost comic), but it is well played and directed, and evokes a great deal of empathy for the character.It's now time for me to jump on my Equal Opportunities high horse, and explain that the film is also a subtle exercise in discrimination and racism, in the same vein as Disney's The Fox and the Hound.  The signs begin appearing in windows saying No Coloreds, just to make the point staringly obvious for those more excited about the toffee popcorn before the movie (optional).  It makes the point simply and effectively, and it's also worth thinking about.  It also talks a great deal about change, traditional family values, and the society in which we live today (the montage at the beginning of the film through various different High School lessons is a good example, and very grimly comic).Unfortunately, I must also point out two negative points about the film firstly, that the film is a little over-long at 124 minutes, and secondly, that the absolute ending confuses the hell out of me.  There are probably thousands of you who understand the last and final camera shot - it probably ties the film together beautifully and is the best part of the film - but not me.  Maybe I'm being thick.  I'm not going to describe it for fear of spoiling it for those of you who haven't seen it before, but it left me scratching my head after an otherwise pleasant and simple movie.In total, though, Pleasantville is funny when it should be, moving when it should be, and above all, simple.  This isn't a bad thing, by any means the points are clear and effective, but it is also very possible to watch Pleasantville without giving much thought to these issues - it is a light, fluffy comedy\/drama, which is ultimately very enjoyable.

It is so riveting, so exciting, and so scary, that you may leave the theater shaking!  Unfortunately, it's a great piece of filmmaking that was released at the wrong time.  Rivaling The Sixth Sense, which has a similar premise, it seems that many people aren't going to see this movie.  When I saw it though, the theater was packed!  It definitely worked for the audience.  People were so scared by some of the scenes, I remember hearing loud screams in the theater, and it wasn't coming from the movie.  In a way, Stir of Echoes is like The Sixth Sense, but on other levels, it's not.  The Sixth Sense was more of a psychological film about a boy who had a gift he did not understand.  Stir of Echoes is more of a murder mystery and a scarefest.  The use of subliminals and the camera effects to show the flashbacks and hallucinations was a stroke of genius!  You get glimpses of something, and although you can't quite tell what it is, you know it's something bad.  It reminded me of Altered States on some levels, because of the quick cuts and the bizarre dream sequences.  It is also very well done.  Kevin Bacon is very good in this film, and for me, it's a chance for him to really act, because pretty much all I have seen him in are supporting roles.  The other thing about Stir of Echoes I liked was how much it lacked the typical Hollywood cliches of The Sixth Sense.  I think The Sixth Sense is a more important film, but I think Stir of Echoes is better because it has the ability to function on it's own without borrowing from any genre or any scare tactics.  I was totally unprepared for the scene where Kevin Bacon sits on the couch and the ghost is sitting right beside him.  The whole audience screamed in terror.  The guy who sat behind me was so freaked out by it, that afterwards he was laughing out loud at how much it caught him off guard.  It was just so unexpected.  This movie also reminded me of The Changeling, because it was about a ghost who died as part of a murder plot, and would never rest until it had it's revenge.  The Sixth Sense has a more important message, but Stir of Echoes is a better movie because it has it's own method of storytelling and it's a much scarier film.  I highly recommend this movie to horror film afficianados, but not to people who are unprepared and just plain don't like that kind of genre.

First the town pharmacist (Pruitt Taylor Vince) keeps having sexual fantisies, where he's some better looking and younger man.  Then a house wife (Mary McDonnell) can't seem to stay happy.  The delinquent teenager (Zooey Deschanel) can't seem to keep a steady boyfriend.  And the town billionare (Jason Lee) can't seem to find a real friend.  But if anyone is really unique, it's the town's new psychiatrist, Dr. Mumford (Loren Dean).  You see, Dr. Mumford isn't really his name, and he really isn't a real psychiatrist. MUMFORD is the new comedy directed by Lawrence Kasdan, who's directed the good film titled GRAND CANYON, the underrated WYATT EARP, and the excellent western SILVERADO. Kasdan returns to comedy this time, and he does a pretty good job at it. The story has Dr. Mumford who is relied by many of the town's people to give them advice on their troubles.  However, Dr. Mumford has fallen in love with one of his patients (Hope Davis).   This is good for the doctor, since he really isn't a doctor, yet he's breaking the law for having people telling him their problems, and not being certified. I enjoyed the characters of MUMFORD, some of them were really engaging.  The two that grabbed my funny bone were the fascinating Skip Skipperton (Jason Lee), and the annoying jerk Lionel Dillard (Martin Short).  Martin Short is usually overlooked with his comedy talent (excpet by the Tony Award voters), and in MUMFORD, Short proves that he can be both funny and annoying.  As for Jason Lee, I'm waiting for a film of his own.  He was very funny and yet surprisingly gentle as the town's billionare.  What's also cool is that Lee gets to show off his original claim to fame, skateboarding, and he is still good at it. But I also liked the Mumford character by Loren Dean, his character has a compelling life story on what brings him to become the new psychiatrist of Mumford, and I'm sure that you probably won't forget it as well.  I would have really liked MUMFORD a lot if it came out last spring or this past summer. Unfortunately, I saw AMERICAN BEAUTY before I saw MUMFORD, and I thought AMERICAN BEAUTY's characters were extremely enthralling, while MUMFORD's characters were only good.

Sure, ''Aliens'' was really great, but it was more of an non-stop actionmovie, ''Alien 3'' was the boring part, and ''Alien Ressurection'' was a bit better, and way more entertaining. But to put it in another way. Many people who loved the three sequels of the movie might just get really dissapointed. This is not at all like the other movies. But if you can accept this kind of slow movies you will love it! 9.5 out of 10!!!!!!

Since that type of thing hasn't really been what you could call overused, I'm okay with it.  What I'm NOT okay with, though, is this movie scoring higher than Usual Suspects, because on originality alone it did not.  Think about it, would you have given the movie such a high rating if it had ended differently?  And you can only give so much credit to an idea that so obviously has been recycled.  But enough diatribe on that.  Beyond that, the movies bear hardly any resemblance to each other.  Sixth Sense is much more of an emotionally touching film (Usual Suspects neither is nor tries to be emotional).  And in spite of my bitterness, I did like the movie a whole lot.  A WHOLE lot more than I expected to--the preview made it look even worse than Bruce's last child-helping film (something about a computer virus, right?)  I don't think Bruce has been this good with a kid since North.  Anyway, the kid completely shone.  I can't wait to see more of him in the future, he's amazing.  And.. back to the summary line...

Yeah, it`s nice camera work, but thats really a negative when your story is a no-story.Malick has heart, no doubts there. Only he needs to be able to communicate his visions much better.Cold and cool, the Thin Red Line is window dressing. A heavier, more beautiful version of Hamburger Hill - lacking the power of Platoon, the realism and in-your-face attitude of Saving Private Ryan, even the coolness and provocative nature of Full Metal Jacket and the drama and thoughtful, believable pocket-philosophy of Apocalypse Now.By-the-way  Watch out for John-I-Have-My-Own-Jet-Travolta in a horrible role as commanding officer aboard the hangarship in the beginning.
