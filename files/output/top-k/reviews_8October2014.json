Its merits and demerits are by now well understood by anyone reading a series of reviews. The movie is too long. The writing leaves in too many repetitive scenes and doesn't come up with enough scenes that reveal character through action. The direction allows too much over-acting by Jack Nicholson. The ending is contrived, not really believable and feels manipulative. The directing and story-telling try to be arty but come across as being unsure. We are watching Sean Penn develop as a writer and director. I can only encourage his efforts, but he has a ways to go. My recollection is that The Pledge was a much better film. He needs someone to take him through the film step by step and point out where it's going wrong.Roger Ebert understands this particular film and points out that it's more about Nicholson's character having become alcoholic over the loss of his daughter when she was killed by the drunken David Morse. He then loses the respect of his wife and his own self-respect. He crosses over to become what Morse was, while Morse in prison crosses over or tries to eliminate his guilt. It stays and is a heavy burden, however. Both men are burdened. Nicholson wants to kill Morse to show himself and his estranged wife (Angelica Huston) that he's a man. Revenge too. The paths of these two men are crossed, as they must be. Penn shows this cinematically by interweaving their two lives, even dissolving from one face to another, from one love-making to the other. But this is exactly where the film gets too slow and repeats its messages and hits us over the head.About 3\/4 of the way through, I felt this film had zero tension, despite the fact that it had a time limit device in it. The outcome was never in doubt. Still, at that point, Penn tried to pick up the pace with the unexpected occurrence, a run-in of Nicholson with some cops, and then a chase scene that ended with the movie's climactic and moving final scene, contrived, not really believable and overly sentimental as it was.The script tried to motivate Nicholson's absurd behavior when he's stopped by cops for driving erratically by showing him as quite violent earlier. But the scene made little sense unless Nicholson is really cracking up, and even then it doesn't ring true. He has told his wife he's cracking up. We hear it. We see he has a temper. But somehow we do not really get his behavior. The screenplay needed some material that better showed this man than one strip club scene after another. We needed to see something that would help us understand his final interaction with Morse. Morse's character was easier to understand, and Morse shows again what a fine actor he is. Not that Jack Nicholson is not. He can really deliver the goods and often does, but he needs a good direction to extract just the right amount of emoting and expression. He overdoes the facial contortions in his big scene with Huston in the restaurant to the point where we do not grasp what he feels until he tells us verbally in an outburst.The movie is a nice try, hopefully a learning experience for Sean Penn, whom I commend for putting this out there where in a sense he goes naked as an artist. It does provide dramatic entertainment but at the price of feeling let down by its writing and directing issues.

The plot is simple and the acting competent. The Van Allen radiation belt has caught fire and the world will be cooked to a crisp and all humanity killed unless a nuclear missile is launched into it. This solution is arrived at by American Admiral Nelson, a brilliant man of science who is going by his own calculations. He sets out on his submarine, the SeaView, to fire the missile from a spot in the Arctic. The subplots are the interesting facets of the film. Michael Ansara plays a religious man resigned, in his own mind, to the world being destroyed and that it's God's will. Joan Fontaine plays a doctor who also has reservations about what Admiral Nelson, played by Walter Pidgeon, is doing. Robert Sterling is Nelson's second in command who increasingly thinks the Admiral is crazy for going rogue. There are near mutinies by the crew who want to go home to their families against the unwavering belief by Admiral Nelson in what he's doing. The movie's final message is an ode to the persistence of Admiral Nelson, one man proceeding against all opposition. He represents the righteous man, the individual American, who doesn't need the consensus of the world community or even his own president (who Walter Pidgeon says is the only authority he need listen to anyway)to stop him from doing what's right. The movie portrays reasonable thinkers as the real villains. Religious men don't provide comfort. They're defeatist, insane, and even criminal. People who try to stop Admiral Nelson stoop to villainous means to do so. They're the real bad guys. They get theirs in the end. The only one that gets it is Nelson, the intelligent military man that saves the world with a weapon of mass destruction. American military power. That will save the day. One can picture a power mad LBJ seeing the movie and remarking how the one that truly counts and makes a difference is the American of vision that fights and continues fighting, not backing down, not listening to anyone else or admitting defeat until a mission, whatever it is, is complete. The movie, Crimson Tide is almost an exact remake with a completely different ending. There is a potential world catastrophe, radio silence, differing views among the crew and a (crazy?) submarine captain that may or may not be right. Unswerving loyalties are questioned by a reasonable interloper (Denzel Washington.) The captain's second in command thinks the captain insane and takes command from him. Lessons learned from 1961 write the different ending. The captain is mad and blindly firing weapons of mass destruction will destroy the world, not save it. The heroes are the thinkers and the skeptics and their sense and sanity save the day. If Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea preaches he who hesitates is lost, Crimson Tide preaches only fools rush in.

Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant play our leading actors, and actually do a very good job. They move at a fast pace, turn their roles into unique feeling characters, and do, for the most part, have a good chemistry (until the very ending). The film is generally well acted all around, but this is where my praise of the film will be coming to a screeching halt. This film has left me fairly confused, and that confusion has turned into a chafing irritation the more I look back and contemplate what exactly I had watched. The root of my confusion stems from the genre this film is labeled under. According to everything I've seen this is a screwball comedy, but I don't understand how a film should qualify as a comedy just because we have an odd couple butting heads throughout what is in all other aspects a crime drama. Despite the way this relationship clashes with the narrative of the film, it does manage some good moments. About 1\/3rd of the way into the film we follow Hildy as she covers the story of a man facing the death penalty for the of shooting a police officer. She visits the jail where he's being held to interview him through the bars of his cell in a way I found very reminiscent of the interview scenes in Capote. She meets with a women grief stricken over her friend's impending execution, and cleverly records her lamenting of the situation. This aspect of the film progresses in a very enjoyable way, and if it was separated from the sort of broken love triangle type deal we have to suffer through otherwise it would have been very good, but it deals a pretty devastating blow to the screwball comedy aspect of the film by becoming far too dark and dramatic. It ends in a suicide and the capture of the man accused, who will now certainly be facing an execution. How does this have any place in a comedy? It really doesn't at all. This brings us to the odd couple\/screwball aspect of the film. The parts that really dragged this film into a deep, dark grave for me. This portion of the narrative centers around Hildy's impending marriage to an all around nice, trusting man named Bruce Baldwin, played by Ralph Bellamy. A guy that could very easily give Hildy exactly what she claims to really want out of life after her plan to leave reporting for good. Upon hearing of her engagement, Walter immediately starts scheming, lying, stealing, cheating, and tormenting his way into their lives in the hopes of splitting them up. He tells Hildy all about how much he wishes they could get re- married, but she quickly rebukes him with all of the many valid complaints she had about his treatment of her as his wife. Throughout the course of the film Walter ends up getting Bruce arrested and sent to jail on three separate occasions, and Hildy really has very little problem with all of this, and in the end, Hildy goes from being engaged to Bruce one minute to planning her re-marriage to Walter, her complete scumbag of an ex, the very next. This movie has to have one of the absolute worst, most ridiculous and completely forced endings I've ever seen. It sloppily ties (most) of the loose ends from the crime drama narrative together in a crusty meat sack of an abomination unto film in the very last two minutes, then has Hildy and Walter holding each other tenderly and planning their coming honeymoon only for it to devolve into exactly what caused them to divorce in the first place. I get that this is supposed to be outlandish and funny, but it is so completely straight out of left field and absurd that it just becomes insulting. Why would Hildy ever agree to this, let alone think it's a good idea? The world will never know. And how did I miss every single laugh in this film? Because they didn't exist.

While the gritty, ugly violence in the North remains a present memory, Éire cannot quite shake off her aura of romance.Waking Ned Devine embraces the magic side of Ireland, perhaps to too great an extent, forgetting to ground itself in a harsher reality. Yet even in its absurdest moments, the talent and charm of the cast anchor the story, lending just a touch of gravitas to what is ultimately the tale of leprechauns stealing gold.Our chief leprechaun is the irrepressible Jackie O'Shea, played with panache and roguish delight by Ian Bannen. His best friend, and every bit his equal, is lanky, timid Michael O'Sullivan (the great David Kelly). They live in Tullymore (Tulaigh Mhór), an idyllic coastal village with 52 inhabitants. When Jackie and Michael deduce that a local has won the lottery, they concoct a string of harebrained devices to identify and ingratiate themselves to the lucky sod. It takes a while to discover that he is, in fact, elderly fisherman Ned Devine, who promptly after realizing his win, died from the shock of it.Jackie and Annie, his rosy-cheeked wife (Fionnula Flanagan), sit quietly in their kitchen and share solemn, small-town generalities about Ned's decency and kindness. It is, of course, a tragedy to die in the face of such a pot of gold; it's worse than ordinary death.

The film begins like DOUBLE INDEMNITY (1944, 8\/10), our ill-fated protagonist Joe Gills (Holden), a 30 something hack writer for the Hollywood studio, narrates beyond his grave to reveal the tragedy ending - as shown in a majestic shot from the angle of the bottom of a swimming pool (a trick done by putting a mirror in the bottom and shot from its reflection), a man's body is floating on the water, facing down, and for sharp eyes, it is obviously Joe himself. So while the voice-over gravely chronicles his story of the last months of his life, on screen, audience is gravitated by the parallel presence of the unwitting Joe, from his down-and-out predicament, till he accidentally runs into Norma Desmond's (Swanson) dilapidated mansion on Sunset Boulevard, on the day of her pet chimp's funeral. The metaphor of Joe's destiny is too apparent to overlook, being a substitute of the lonely but opulent has-been's companion, until his own doom. Wilder and his co-writers cook up a perfect match for the duo, Norma has penned her own script of Salome and is desirous of launching her comeback with Cecil B. DeMille in the Paramount lot. So she is in urgent need of a writer to revise her dilettantish work, and Joe, just reaches the end of his tether to survive in the showbiz, it realistically starts off as a win-win deal for both, until when Joe realizes what Norma needs is more than just a writer and what is more satirically, he is not a competent ghost writer, the output of Salome's script is a dud, Paramount has no intention to produce the picture at all, although indulging a 50-year-old to star as Salome is too idiosyncratic to begin with. So Joe caves in as a reluctant gigolo for Norma and she falls for him inevitably, her suffocating dominance is normally compensated by her gratification of material luxury. Naturally Joe is struggling, the reality is too hard to refuse, but internally he despises of his degeneration. It is a moral dilemma, so there must be a vent somewhere, when he meets Betty Schaefer (Olson), a young and inspiring fellow writer, age 22, the time with her becomes his safe haven, even his writer's block is dismantled, they contribute wonderful ideas for a new script of a romance. Unfortunately Norma will never let him go, the tricky part is, Joe is never completely heartless to her, on the first notice of her suicidal attempt at the New Year's Eve, he rushes back to her bed immediately and they reconcile romantically. We can tell Joe loves her, but with the condition of sympathy, guilt and shame, and it is all because of the 20-year-old age difference and the huge gap in their social status, the film is bold tirade aiming at the hypocritical showbiz of its ageism and male chauvinism. For Norma, Joe represents the last straw of her life, her mirage of being an eternal star which is timeless and beloved. Swanson gives a show-stopping tour-de-force as Norma, exaggerates her condescending mannerism with dramatic grandeur and empress mien, the trademark popped eyes and protruding jaw perfectly render a thrilling pathos as someone who is ridiculously ill-fitted in the present world thanks to her own background which is painfully similar to Norma. The film gifts Swanson the only opportunity to shine in the talkie era and she accomplishes it with impeccability, this is one of the most powerful performance ever (I give her an edge over the equally iconic performance from Betty Davis in ALL ABOUT EVE 1950, 9\/10), and its indelible impact is caustically mind-blowing, not to mention her final descending from the stairs to the cameramen, and her iconic last line.

Cut to the next scene we see Tina Gray (Wyss) finds herself walking down a dark, creepy hallway hearing eerie laughter then out of nowhere a goat, yes a goat. Tina now finds herself in a boiler room the constant dripping of water, the laughter the sense that she is not alone. Then it begins you hear the claws scratching the metal, a glimpse of a hat, face and a man in the distance, the sound of goats, she's backed into a corner then boom he strikes we get our first glimpse of the scariest slasher I have ever known. I can pretty much play this scene in my brain from memory now.I don't want to talk to much about the story, it just has to be seen to be appreciated, Wes Cravens directing in the two opening scenes in which I mentioned are so on point you will watch them and know what the film is going to be like.People will argue that majority of the success for A Nightmare On Elm Street comes for the performance given by Robert Englund as Fred, which is not entirely wrong a lot does come from that but also from Cravens writing and directing.

Craven has even spoken recently on his Instagram about how there was nearly no Elm Street. The film is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year, and it is still loved across the many generations who have seen it, and me personally I will continue to tell people how perfect a film it truly is so I will help keep it alive for whatever time I am on this planet hoping you guys and girls will also.Overall, the film is a masterpiece in its genre and for me personally a triumph in what a man can do when he puts his whole heart into a project. There is some problems with the acting but that happens in EVERY Horror film, the effects, the story, the acting of Englund and Langenkamp, the directing, the music, just everything makes up for that. The greatest slasher in history, I'll say it the best monster\/villain performance since Boris Karloff as Frankenstein's Monster in Frankenstein 1931, there I said it.

Given, too, that the film's production was 1960, we can say that Elmer Gantry does not reflect the current, 21st century, state of religious fundamentalism in America. The film is basically how Hollywood, in the late 1950s, viewed tent religion in the early part of the twentieth century.Given that the Production Code, with its moral censorship guidelines, was still in force when the film was made, the script is a sanitized version of the Sinclair Lewis novel. Hollywood thus tries to straddle the fence in its faith vs. no-faith theme, and render characters as merely flawed, not evil.Thus, vacuum salesman Elmer Gantry (Burt Lancaster) may be slimy, deceptive, hypocritical, scheming, and manipulative, but he can also recite lines from the Bible. To make him any more diabolical would have angered a majority of viewers in 1960. Similarly, Sister Sharon (Jean Simmons) may collect money from those who go to her revivals, but it's to pay the bills and all the logistics necessary for her ministry. Further, she seems so sincere and, seemingly, can render miracles.We can thus forgive Hollywood for taking this approach to the story in 1960. At that time, nobody could foresee how self-serving and hateful religious fundamentalism would become in politics in the latter part of the 20th century. After all, Sister Sharon talked a lot about love, not hate.The film is quite grandiose, a big-scale production, well over two hours in duration. Scenes are lavish in scope, heavy on dialogue, and visually robust, no doubt a carryover from those big screen sword and sandal epics of the 1950s. As such, the story seems contrived. Performances, especially that of Burt Lancaster, seem exaggerated.As a big, splashy Hollywood production, Elmer Gantry is okay, except for its length, its contrived story, and its exaggerated performances. But it doesn't reflect modern religious fundamentalism. For that, a more realistic, and relevant, movie is Marjoe (1972), about a child evangelist.

However, i still remember it fondly, and the differences between its contemporary rugged style and the vintage and cinematic Central Station are striking. Albeit, there is still a journey involved, an emotionally and physically exhausting journey, this is just through a different lens. The centrepiece of Central Station is the remarkable performance from veteran Brazilian actress Fernanda Montenegro. She's compassionate yet judgmental, kind-hearted yet mean-spirited. It's a delicately dimensional character haunted by the demons of her early life bolstered by a forceful performance that surely deserved more attention than it did in 1998.Her support isn't quite as strong however, but her bonds with them certainly are. While the wayward route is probably the best choice to portray the small boy that she takes on to return to his father, he is inherently irritating for his rowdy behaviour. This makes her plight all the more sympathetic as we questions whether the sacrifices she made for such an agitator outweigh the good deed. It's got interesting themes on family, regarding roles and structures. It's wonderful to see a small accidental family form as they meet a generous man who helps them for a small portion of the way, but of whom swiftly abandons them without reason. It illustrates how painfully fleeting these relationships can be. It does feel distinctly anti-male due to these representations, but it is the point the film is trying to make about the emotional poverty it causes.The film is full of atmosphere with sweeping cinematography capturing the heat of Brazil and the density of its population while they weave in and out of frame. Even with the company, it's hard not to feel alone. However, some scenes do feel a little forced in the direction, breaking the spell of reality that some human moments have, such as overblown conflict between the two characters before their eventual kinship. It makes storytelling sense for them to go through it and the film is richly written in that regard, but it could've been handled better. It also suffers from a trite motif in the score that tries too hard to jerk tears but it's easily ignorable.

I'm glad I watched this film it has been out for a while and I felt I was missing out when I heard people saying 'I see dead people'. That quote is clearly associated with the film and I wanted to know what it meant so I watched it. Definitely worth a watch.

After the unintentionally hilarious Friday The 13thA New Beginning left a bad taste in Friday fans mouths,Jason Lives was seen as a return to form for the series and has become a fan favorite since it's release in 1986. What makes Jason Lives very entertaining and memorable is the way writer-director Tom McLoughlin approaches the material giving the series a shot in the arm giving fans a movie that is stylish and atmospheric as well as very explosive and thrilling with intensity and fun. And while Jason Lives has most of the trademarks that are associated with the Friday The 13th series and other Slasher movies there are thing Jason Lives that feels fresh and creative with an energy and pace that never stops until the very end. One of the things that makes Jason Lives such a great sequel is the Humor that is hilarious and nonstop with lines and characters that are funny which makes JL light but not too light. The Humor and laughs are also funny because the pop culture references and self aware thinking that the characters have which predates the Humor and style that Scream(1996)would do 10 years later. Although the film is funny there is a creepy and intense atmosphere with white hot suspense that hangs over the film with fog,dark clouds,rain and wind which is a homage to the universal Horror films of the the 1930s and 40s and when Jason is around the atmosphere is more intense. Where most characters in Friday The 13ths and other Slasher films are lined up to be killed and slaughtered the main characters in JL are likable and memorable to the point we feel bad for them when things start to go haywire. What's interesting about JL is the fact that little kids are at the camp which raises the stakes of the movie even higher because when you watch the movie you will wonder would Jason go after the kids? Watch the movie and find out. By the sixth film in the series Jason not only became a Horror icon but also a pop culture icon and antihero and with Jason Lives Jason is the star of the movie. When Jason comes back from the grave he is stronger and more powerful than he was before because guns,knives or any other weapon will stop him from killing people in a brutal fashion. While Jason in 2,3 and 4 was running a lot in Jason Lives he is in some cases a Zombie who walks really fast and no matter how far the victims run Jason will catch up with you. The blood and gore are on full display here with Jason doing what he does best and that's sneaking up on his victims and killing them in gory ways with some of the biggest body count in the series and while the blood and gore is light compared to some of the other films in the franchise the red plasma is still there. Jason Lives is Jason at his brutal and bloody best. The ending in Jason Lives is amazing and one of the finest endings in the entire series with tons of thrills and excitement with a few surprises that will stay with Friday The 13th fans. An incredible ending.The cast is wonderful. Thom Matthews is terrific as Tommy Jarvis with Matthews bringing the right emotion to the role. Jennifer Cooke is wonderful and sexy as Megan Garris,a camp counselor and sheriff Garris' daughter that helps Tommy. C.J Graham is outstanding and menacing as Jason Voorhees and is a great precursor to Kane Hodder's Jason. David Kagen is fantastic as Sheriff Michael Garris,a tough sheriff with a heart of gold and Megan's Father. Renee Jones(Sissy),Kerry Noonan(Paula),Tom Fridley(Cort),Nancy Mcloughlin(Lizbeth)and Tony Goldwyn(Darren)do fine jobs as the other camp counselors. Vincent Guastaferro(Deputy Rick),Courtney Vickery(Nancy),Darcy DeMoss(Nikki)and Ron Palillo(Hawes)give good performances as well.The direction by Tom Mcloughlin is amazing and stylish,with Mcloughlin always moving the camera and giving the movie an atmospheric and stunning look. Great direction,Mcloughlin.The score by Harry Manfredini is sensational,creepy,intense and is one of the best scores in the series matching the tone of the movie perfectly. Incredible score,Manfredini. There is also great Rock songs in the movie from Alice Cooper(He's Back-The Man Behind The Mask,Teenage Frankenstein,Hard Rock Summer)and Felony(Animal).In final word,if you love the Friday The 13th series,Jason Voorhees,Horror films or Slasher movies in general,I highly suggest you see Friday The 13th Part VIJason Lives,an excellent and thrilling sequel that is one of the best films in the franchise.

To produce something that will have any impact in the medium, you will have to depart from convention.

I feel that as film culture matures with young generations of internet film pirates growing up on easily accessible movies, timeless films like Groundhog Day and Memento will eventually attain the reverence they truly deserve.Memento also has a clear interpretation (unlike say...

It is far from being pretentious in that once you understand the presentation, the reasons for it become manifestly clear.

There's a sleazy mob boss (Dennis Farina), a perpetually angry FBI investigator (Yaphet Kotto at his funniest), two eccentric bail bondsmen, and a real-life Horace-and-Jasper. Yet, even with all these exaggerated caricatures, our two main characters manage to find moments of surprising depth amid all the malarkey.Robert De Niro, in a unique turn, plays John Wesley Jack Walsh, a down- on-his-luck, smart-aleck bounty hunter. Charles Grodin is a mild-mannered embezzler, Jonathan The Duke Mardukas, on the run for breaking bond. Promised $100,000 if he brings in Mardukas by midnight on Friday, Walsh quickly finds and apprehends him in New York. The Duke's aviophobia prevents the pair from traveling by plane to Los Angeles, so they take to the road. Of course, everything that can go wrong does go wrong. Besides a number of obstacles, they are pursued by another bounty hunter, the FBI, and the mob through a series of madcap adventures.The twist is that both Walsh and Mardukas are basically noble men (in the hard-bitten, Clint Eastwood Western sense) striving for exactly the same end. Mardukas, for instance, is a salt of the earth accountant who stole $15 million from a mobster to give to charity. Walsh, formerly a dedicated undercover cop, refused to be paid off by the same mobster, which cost him everything he held dear, and made him into the cynical jerk we all know and love.Very quickly the straitlaced Mardukas realizes that he can use his moral authority to bully the secretly conscientious Jack into giving way (incidentally, this technique doesn't work at all on Walsh's hard-hearted foil, Marvin - he's what Jack pretends to be). The Duke uses every chance he can to awaken Jack's dormant moral compass, from advising him to quit smoking (Come on - cigarettes are killers!) to encouraging that he renew his relationship with his ex-wife and daughter (Don't you want to be loved?). All this, of course, drives the nervy bounty hunter crazy and results in dialogues by turns hilarious and heartfelt. In the end, they're still bickering, but like an old couple Shut up! I'm not talking to you for the whole rest of this trip!The key to all this is that De Niro and Grodin are not trying to be funny. They don't have to. With a few exceptions - Grodin in one scene involving chickens - both of them are merely playing their characters straight, and it's hysterical. De Niro effortlessly shifts gears between cocky sarcasm, fury, insecurity, sensitivity, and vulnerability - sometimes all of them at once. It is his performance I enjoyed more the second time through.Grodin's doing his usual Curmudgeon Suffering Righteously act (this was the first film I'd seen him in - but I've been thoroughly enjoying his in- character Letterman interviews), and consequently has less depth than the many shades De Niro brings to Walsh, but that's not entirely his faultMardukas Why don't you get yourself a new watch? Walsh I'll tell you when I know you better. Mardukas You know me better? When are you gonna to get to know me better? I'm getting to know you better. You're not gonna get to know me better. Walsh Will you SHUT UP? Mardukas That's what I mean.Regardless, he's perfectly cast as the sulky, teddy-bear white-collar criminal.A few last comments the pacing, script, direction, supporting cast, and wonderful, wonderful soundtrack are all great. It's immensely quotable. The movie is a bit long - Grodin and De Niro are separated for a while near the end of the movie and things begin to drag. But it's still one of the best of its kind - and never, ever boring.Review originally posted here www.longview95.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"8 October 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" In many ways, Midnight Run is an over-sized parody of other 80's buddy flicks, because you've seen it all before.But Midnight Run embraces its clichés to the point of parody.

Walsh I'll tell you when I know you better. Mardukas You know me better? When are you gonna to get to know me better? I'm getting to know you better. You're not gonna get to know me better. Walsh Will you SHUT UP? Mardukas That's what I mean.Regardless, he's perfectly cast as the sulky, teddy-bear white-collar criminal.A few last comments the pacing, script, direction, supporting cast, and wonderful, wonderful soundtrack are all great. It's immensely quotable. The movie is a bit long - Grodin and De Niro are separated for a while near the end of the movie and things begin to drag.

There's a sleazy mob boss (Dennis Farina), a perpetually angry FBI investigator (Yaphet Kotto at his funniest), two eccentric bail bondsmen, and a real-life Horace-and-Jasper. Yet, even with all these exaggerated caricatures, our two main characters manage to find moments of surprising depth amid all the malarkey.Robert De Niro, in a unique turn, plays John Wesley Jack Walsh, a down- on-his-luck, smart-aleck bounty hunter. Charles Grodin is a mild-mannered embezzler, Jonathan The Duke Mardukas, on the run for breaking bond. Promised $100,000 if he brings in Mardukas by midnight on Friday, Walsh quickly finds and apprehends him in New York. The Duke's aviophobia prevents the pair from traveling by plane to Los Angeles, so they take to the road. Of course, everything that can go wrong does go wrong. Besides a number of obstacles, they are pursued by another bounty hunter, the FBI, and the mob through a series of madcap adventures.The twist is that both Walsh and Mardukas are basically noble men (in the hard-bitten, Clint Eastwood Western sense) striving for exactly the same end. Mardukas, for instance, is a salt of the earth accountant who stole $15 million from a mobster to give to charity. Walsh, formerly a dedicated undercover cop, refused to be paid off by the same mobster, which cost him everything he held dear, and made him into the cynical jerk we all know and love.Very quickly the straitlaced Mardukas realizes that he can use his moral authority to bully the secretly conscientious Jack into giving way (incidentally, this technique doesn't work at all on Walsh's hard-hearted foil, Marvin - he's what Jack pretends to be). The Duke uses every chance he can to awaken Jack's dormant moral compass, from advising him to quit smoking (Come on - cigarettes are killers!) to encouraging that he renew his relationship with his ex-wife and daughter (Don't you want to be loved?). All this, of course, drives the nervy bounty hunter crazy and results in dialogues by turns hilarious and heartfelt. In the end, they're still bickering, but like an old couple Shut up! I'm not talking to you for the whole rest of this trip!The key to all this is that De Niro and Grodin are not trying to be funny. They don't have to. With a few exceptions - Grodin in one scene involving chickens - both of them are merely playing their characters straight, and it's hysterical. De Niro effortlessly shifts gears between cocky sarcasm, fury, insecurity, sensitivity, and vulnerability - sometimes all of them at once.

I'm not sure how they think their child will rule the galaxy when its apparent that traversing great distances on their own planet involve riding an animal!! Coupled with the fact that Colwyns family and Lyssas family have been at war with each other for a long time, and its only the arrival of the Black Fortress that gets them to change their minds, and rather conveniently, Colwyn and Lyssa can't get enough of each other.So much rivalry forgotten so quickly! To be fair, Lyssa (played by Lysette Anthony) was an absolutely stunning looking woman in Krull, a pity then that she was dubbed for the entirety of the movie with some ridiculously breathy American who seemed determined to over pronounce every word..... Col.....Wyn! Great to see the likes of Liam Neeson and Robbie Coltrane in earlier roles.VFX for the time were pretty good, OK, it looks a little clunky now, but this wasn't a cheap movie and they didn't skimp on the visuals.So what else? Well as a kid, I thought the Glaive was the coolest looking weapon ever, much cooler than a lightsabre.... upon watching it as an adult, I don't remember it hardly being used until the end of the movie! Considering the lengthy rock climbing, lava dipping scene to get the damned thing, it was barely used.And what of the main bad guy.. the Beast? Looked kind of OK until it moved. Clearly someone dressed up in a costume with liberal amounts of Vaseline smeared over the camera lense to obscure it, the entire time the Beast moved, it just looked.... not scary.Doing weird things with its arms as its firing stuff at Colwyn, moving too fast when being attacked by the Glaive, and the worst thing...... not being quite sure how big the Beast was.Any time you saw it, you assumed it was massive, then something would happen to put something you knew the size of into shot and the Beast all of a sudden looked a lot smaller.And yes, Lyssa was stunning, beautiful, even as a child I thought yeah, if I was older, I would so put my Rubiks Cube down for that!, but the Beast was massive, just what did it think it was going to do with her? A technologically superior alien being with powers and big wants a small tiny pretty human girl from a planet that hasn't even mastered electric lighting or a Postal service!!! The problem with Krull, is its a fantasy, and the film makers thought that gave them carte blanche for anything goes.... but thats not quite how it works.Characters making bizarre choices simply so the plot can move on.Your missus turns into a widow in a spiders web for killing your child? Not a problem, just brush that one off.Band of brigands that rob to stay alive decide to go on a perilous quest with the new King? Not a problem, and throw in casual disregard for safety by each one of them apart from two dying into the bargain as well.I don't hate Krull, but its a mess and it was obvious that someone had a truck load of cash to make the movie and were more concerned with spending it rather than wait to see if what they were spending it on was worth it.Nostalgia and Lysette Anthony are why i'm not being harder on this movie, by all rights I should be voting it 2\/10, but Nostalgia and Lysette Anthony are a powerful combination.Now go rule the galaxy.... on horseback!
