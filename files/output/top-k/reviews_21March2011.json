[{"date":"21 March 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Fight Club may seem just about letting go and stop trying to control everything and venting out your anger so that it just doesn't explode inside you every time you're on the verge of..well exploding. But it's about more than that. It delivers a message about thinking about your life and realising that you've submitted to commercialism, to hypocrisy and to consumerism. All the fights and all the explosions and the sex in this movie are just covers for what actually goes on. They're just the in between parts of a movie that are minor details. And just what this movie does is treat its message like a minor detail so that those who truly pay attention figure it out. The most beautiful scene in the entire movie is when Tyler forces the grocer to follow his dream, albeit in an unconventional way. And that scene is the gist of the entire movie. Fight Club was a very unusual movie in that it left me unsure and uncertain of what to think of it. I kept thinking about what the film was getting at, what it was trying to teach me and like the narrator I was also distracted by the unneeded and unimportant details of the movie that was his life. The deep rooted message was to live your life and not get caught up with the farce that the world has become. When Tyler tells the narrator that the things we own end up owning us, he's talking to you. And you better listen because he's telling the truth. The otherwise violent and sexually perverted parts of the film are why I cut three points off this film's score, the reason I give it 7 is because of its deep rooted message and the way it delivers it. I do not say that it is a perfect film, (far from it) it could've been much much better and that goes for the book as well, but it does deliver a message and a good one at that, one which sinks in. Unlike the pathetic film and book that was A Clockwork Orange.

If you are used to a brick-solid plot-line, obvious storyline, then this will be difficult to follow. There are many elements, threads, characters, and to have them all woven together in under two hours is a formidable task. The film-makers all did a good job. The acting even for one-line actors is superb, the attention to detail of sets a work of love, and of course the range and depth of ideas from Herbert's original astounding.It also serves well as a symbolic vessel, reflect on its potential meanings. eg The dreamer shall awaken? That's you, buddy. The hand? Referring to metalanguage, including genus of concept. More advanced investment symbol for rerooting. If only we can evolve the social equivalent of the opposable thumb. The notable near-absence of computers? Emphasis on the human potential, mentats and all. Vocal weapons? The power of converting thoughts directly into words. And of course the Bene Gesserit's Voice, ala hypnosuggestion. Spice? Oil, but this may be too close to the original laying by Herbert. More interestingly, the psychotropic effect of pot, ganja, weed. Arrakis? The Arab world, is humdrum. How about the importance of potable water, which is set to be the primary issue in the next global theatre of war? Dream sequences? Prescience, not in terms of the character and the fantasy world, but in terms of you watching the film or book enabling a comparison of your future projection with others. The Guild? And the Emperor? The power-brokers the governments, moneylenders and businessmen. The Guild want to kill Paul before he awakens. Somebody doesn't want you to wake up to the world situation. Guerilla fighting of the people of Dune? Notice, men and women. It's grassroots up. Everyone does their share. The sense of oneness is shared. The trust they invest in certain leaders. The simple way of electing a leader. Hand-to-hand final fight between Paul and the Harkonnen? Conflict should be resolved in this small way. Not the Emperor and his generals firing through virtual screens. Hand on heart when Duncan leaves Paul? Obvious meme. Let's not turn it into the Vulcan V, but it might be useful. The Gom-Jabbar and Paul's test? Reprised in Fight Club, and inherited from North American Indian ritual when a boy becomes a man and has to transcend the fear of pain. The film's retro-styling avoids the obvious dating of so many sci-fi's. Since the theme is about time and prediction, it is a beautifully appropriate realisation.I watched it as a teenager having not read the books. I didn't have anything to compare it to, so it had nothing missing. Although Lynch had to compromise, the editors did an amazing job to make the whole thing hang together for a teenager.Superb film\/book, both realised incredibly well.

It debuted in the USA in December 1971 and in Britain the following month. After over a year on release, it was eventually withdrawn from UK distribution by Kubrick and was never re-issued or shown on TV or released on video.Not until March 2000 did A CLOCKWORK ORANGE reappear on British screens (following Kubrick's death), released from it's cinematic exile and glowing in bright colours as good as it had been in 1971. However, the film's futuristic vision nowadays resembles an alternative version of the 1970s (something British viewers of a certain age will recognise). It's a very British grimness with it's drab flats, ugly prisons and concrete housing estates.The film's depiction of sex and violence seems restrained compared to those other two notorious British films of 1971 - THE DEVILS and GET CARTER. In fact, there is only one on screen death and that's committed by Malcolm Macdowell as Alex wearing a large rubber nose, a bowler hat, a white boiler suit and a cod piece (his murder weapon is a giant penis sculpture).The look and sound of this film never diminish, with its claustrophobic interiors and a startling use of music listen to Purcell's Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary over the titles or Rossini's Thieving Magpie used to accompany a night of gang fights and joy riding. The film is set in a London terrorised by hooligans like the surprisingly articulate Alex and his idiot droogs. The opening half hour comprises of the beating up of a tramp, a gang fight, a joy ride, a burglary and a rape. When Alex later gets his comeuppance for murder, the route out of prison is a new form of aversion therapy advocated by the Home Secretary (Anthony Sharp, every inch the suave upper class 1970s Tory). With his eyes prized open Alex is forced to watch endless sex and violence on screen, having being injected so that he feels nauseous and near to death whenever the impulse to sex and violence kicks in. In the end, his 'cure' is a reversion to a helpless state which means on the outside he becomes a victim of the various people he has wronged.But the films concludes with Alex being readjusted back to his normal state, a moment brilliantly realised with Beethoven's Ninth on the soundtrack and a fantasy of Alex having sex in public I was cured alright he says. Cue Gene Kelly's 'Singing in the Rain'.Today, the other thing which will distress a viewer is Patrick Magee's very bad acting but you'll be exhilarated on so many levels. It's a film far from everyone's taste and I'm not altogether how seriously we're meant to take it.
