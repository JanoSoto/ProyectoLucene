No.  I only know LIFE OF BRIAN so intimately because I've seen it so often, it's still one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen, and persists in being hilarious despite familiarity, which, as in so much Python did, is the reverse of what comedy is 'supposed' to be made of (i.e. surprise).Also, nostalgia value.  MONTY PYTHON were my first heroes, before I even reached double figures.  I gobbled up every programme, film and record in a space of a couple of short years, so they are bound up with a period of my life when I was very happy and hopeful, so I go all misty-eyed when I see it.  Bizarrely, we were first encouraged to watch BRIAN by our Latin teacher, who felt it was very insightful about Roman society.But no-one watches PYTHON anymore, except that dorkish clique.  My brother, only a couple of years my junior, is as mystified now by my reaction to it as my parents were then.  But surely BRIAN is a comic masterpiece in itself, accessible to anyone who found the very male, elitist, academic bias of the programme somewhat alienating?How can I implore you to watch this?  It's got a straight narrative, with some of the greatest set-pieces and dialogue of any film ever.  It's not a great FILM comedy - Terry Jones is no Gilliam - but the style suits the humour perfectly, allowing it to breathe, and sometimes pulling off an extraordinarily evocative shot, such as when Brian and his mother are walking from Jesus' sermon, and squabbling about petty things like big noses, and the camera pulls back to a vast Judean wasteland, with a massive Roman statue being wheeled, and a set of crucifixes being planted a marvellous encapsulation of a period in history.This is the film's true triumph - it's a magnificent deconstruction of historical distortion.  By paralleling the life of Christ with that of an ordinary little man, Python reclaim history from symbol and myth.  It brings the body back into history.  Its resolute rejection of divinity leads to a bleak, ironic conclusion (listen to 'Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life' carefully, and in context it's NOT comforting) - the story of Jesus without redemption is ghastly.The intelligence behind the juvenile gags is astonishing - the film is a learned commentary on power, totalitarianism, repression, language, gender, the writing of history, the politics of subversion, the complicity of the repressed.  Myth is thrown to the wind - the film succeeds where Reg and his revolutionaries fail, by revealing a whole series of repressive apparatum (sic?).  No-one is spared - the film is unashamedly destructive, but the film's satire is not arid or narrow; there are many rich parallels with our own time, as the extraordinary reaction from the religious on the film's release showed.But BRIAN is not just an attack on religion, but on all who would seek to write selective histories for their own interests, suppressing others' voices.  The silliest jokes are also the most profound - in one scene, the kidnappers enter Pilate's palace through a tiled floor.  They emerge through a modesty-concealing leaf painted on this floor.  This is snickering schoolboy humour, and very very funny, but is also a comment on the phallocentricity of imperialism.  Jokes like these are why BRIAN will always remain vital - it turns you into a ludicrous, ill-informed amateur historian.The acting is an astonishing feat of multiple performances, but Graham Chapman, always my favorite Python, holds the chaos together, ironically as the Kafkaesque hero who races towards the abyss, an anti-Jesus to love and identify with.  If I've made the film sound like hard work, than I'm an idiot.  The seriousness is only there if you want it.  Like Alice in Wonderland, or Buster Keaton, PYTHON seem to be full of metaphors that encapsulate the pains of life, but are also damnably entertaining.  It's strange that men as supposedly 'surreal' and 'out there' as the Pythons should speak such good sense.

Affleck, the prospective groom, has to make his way to Savanna in two days after a plane problem, complicated by an arriving hurricane. He meets up with the ditsy Bullock, and both of them learn quite a bit about themselves. If you watch the special features on the DVD, Bullock explains how every one you meet, even short chance meetings, have some impact on you, and this is a large part of what the movie tries to convey. And it does it very well. There's good acting, lots of interesting developments, and a very good story in total. I give it 7 of 10. It is a much better movie than I expected.The DVD picture is very well done, and the sound track likewise, with appropriate use of the rear surround channels. My only complaint? Not enough bass rumble during the lightning and thunder scenes during the storms.July 2010 update Saw it again, a pretty entertaining movie with a good message.

There was a section of every major city which contained anywhere from five to fifteen porn movie houses (the combat zone in Boston is one example).  As the '70's came to an end and we moved into the 1980's, video tape and home VCR's became affordable for the mass American public.  This lead to increased public pressure to close the porn movie houses which the industry was losing money with anyway.  Why go to the theater when you could now sit in the privacy of your own home and watch a porn video?  People who would have otherwise avoided ever seeing a porn film for fear of being seen walking into one of the theaters could now enjoy a rented porn video at home.Boogie Nights, written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, examines the industry and a small group of fictional porn film makers during the last part of the 1970's and the early 1980's.  For the most part, the examination is insightful and wrenching.1977-porn director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) spots his next star discovery bussing tables at the night club Horner and his small entourage frequent in Los Angeles.  This next star is 17 year old Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg), a high school drop out from Torrance, California experiencing home troubles with a mother who doesn't know how to keep her mouth shut and a loving but ineffective father.  Gradually, using his inexperience in life, easy sex, and free flowing alcohol, Horner absorbs Eddie into his world and fashions him into the biggest male porn star since John Holmes.  And Eddie, who becomes Dirk Diggler, is more than willing to follow the path.  Horner's world includes porn star Maggie who uses the screen name Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), porn star Buck Swope (Don Cheadle), porn actress Brandy, porn actor Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly) and film crewmen  Little Bill (William H. Macy) and Scotty (Philip Seymour Hoffman).All the characters are well written, brought alive brilliantly by Paul Thomas Anderson.  Each has a story all their own but share a common bond as members of Horner's surrogate family.  They reminded me of soldiers at war who share common psychological pain and form a strong bond of friendship, a form of love for each other.  There is a constant conflict in each character, as if they woke up one day and asked themselves how did I get here? and would rather be anywhere else.  As a result, they attempt to bring legitimacy to their lifestyle by convincing themselves they are actors.  Even Horner, who is by no means an evil man, has an inner dream of being a director of mainstream film.  One of the beauties of the screenplay is that he never really talks about it.If there is a flaw in Boogie Nights, it is in the third act.  As things have fallen apart in Horner's surrogate family and some have gone their separate ways, the film becomes somewhat Tarantino-esqe as we follow these characters into a mire of drugs and trouble.  Even Buck, who has gotten married and wants desperately to go legit by opening a stereo store, finds himself in a situation which combines elements of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.  Ditto for Eddie and Reed.  It was almost as if Paul Thomas Anderson ran out of original ideas.  And in an unbelievable scene, Buck is refused a small business loan at a bank because of his past as a porn star.  Now, by this time it is December, 1983, the beginning of the yuppie greed era, and I can't think of one bank that would refuse a loan based on Eddie's past employment (unless it was illegal, which porn star is not).  That in itself does not make Eddie a bad risk.  And even if he was refused, I'm sure there would have been at least one L.A. bank who would have approved the loan.  But then the film picks up again and the last ten minutes brings us full circle.The soundtrack, mostly songs from the late '70's and early '80's, is wonderful.  The songs chosen inspire nostalgia and fit each scene perfectly.  The same is true for the on target costume and set design, which captures the 1977-1983 period so flawlessly I was glad to see the disco era died.Boogie Nights contains probably the best performance Burt Reynolds has ever given.  Mark Wahlberg is fantastic as Eddie.  William H. Macy is great as usual.  And the rest of the cast is powerful.  These characters literally came alive.Paul Thomas Anderson fashioned a very insightful, sometimes wrenching character study that could very easily be the basis for a debate on porn in American society.  Although the film is slightly flawed, Paul Thomas Anderson is a director with much talent with the camera and I am looking forward to seeing his next film.
