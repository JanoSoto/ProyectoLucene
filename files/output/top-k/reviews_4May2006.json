Like any movie, they aren't perfect and have their flaws. Attack of the Clones is no different. There are definitely some boring scenes, BAD dialogue, crappy editing, so on and so forth... but it's not shite like many other Star Wars fans say.Being a girl, I have to say I like romance mixed in with all the action, which can be found in other movies like Sin City. The biggest problem with AotC is that's exactly what is supposed to happen, and it...does...kind of. The love story between Anakin and Padme was so horribly underdeveloped, or at least executed poorly. How are they supposed to be in love? Because Anakin thinks she's pretty, and she's attracted to whiny men? I don't get it. Lucas really needed some help on that entire portion of the script. If he had accepted help from other screenwriters, maybe a general audience would have believed these two are supposed to be in LOVE. And, as it has been said before, the romantic dialogue really needed tweaking. I won't say it's horrible, but it's far from good. It lacks any sort of real emotional depth or personality for the character.My second problem with AotC is Count Dooku. Who the hell is he? We don't even see the amazing Christopher Lee until the final half-hour of the film. He was another mysterious, undeveloped character in the PT, almost as if he were simply thrown into the mix of things just to be a villain. I must say I really enjoyed his lightsaber duel with Yoda, so at least he had one really good fight scene.The third problem is the editing. Some scenes dragged on way too long, others were cut too short. I also think a few of the deleted scenes should have been left in for the sake of character development. It might have added a longer running time and taken away from the action Lucas was so obsessed with in the PT, but at least we would have been able to know the characters better.The 4th and biggest problem I have with Ep. II is the MAJOR lack of a good soundtrack. John Williams is my favorite movie composer of all time, and the Star Wars saga would not be the same without his music. I'm disappointed he didn't do better on this installment's soundtrack, save for the Across the Stars theme, which is absolutely gorgeous. However, it's the only great song on there, unlike the other Star Wars official soundtracks. Sad, really.Despite its' flaws, Attack of the Clones is not an awful movie, and still one of my favorites despite the bad parts. It's a fair 5th installment in the Star Wars saga, and well worth a viewing, maybe even two or three.See it if only for Yoda. In this one, kick major ass he does. =) ","genre":null},{"date":"4 May 2006","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" A huge Star Wars fan myself, I'll always say the originals are better than the PT (except for maybe RotS, which is tied with the originals IMO), but that doesn't mean the PT is utter crap.

I am not usually a Kurt Russell fan at all but as Wyatt Earp he was quite good in this movie. This is probably his best performance. I was not expecting much so I walked away pleasantly surprised. The plot is nothing especially unique, tension between good and bad leading to a showdown, but it does have some special qualities. The characters are well-rounded; the humor is dry and wonderful.Val Kilmer's character, Doc Holliday, is especially witty. Aside from being comic his character seems to have much more depth to it. He keeps up this persona of careless living even as he is slowly dying from tuberculosis. Maybe the fact that death was imminent encouraged the idea that he had nothing to lose. Underneath the drunken exterior Doc shows himself to be a true friend to Wyatt. Even though he is very outgoing he does not have many, if any, other true friends and that means a lot to him. I especially like the scene where Wyatt is supposed to meet Johnny Ringo for a shoot-out. He knows Ringo is faster than him and that there's no way he can beat him but he goes anyways because he feels that he must in order to get things settled once and for all. Before he can get there, however, Doc (who has a very quick hand) shows up and takes his place. Even though he was so ill at that point that he was incredibly weak he still did that for his friend because he didn't want Wyatt to die. He probably figured that since he was going to die anyways he might as well take a crack at Ringo. If he could beat him then Wyatt wouldn't have to risk his life. If not, well, at least he tried.Dana Delany is also quite good as Josephine Marcus. She is not your average woman who was ruled by men and whose only purpose was to get married and look pretty. She does not want to settle down in one place. Rather, she wants to travel around the world and see everything and, as she put it, live off of room service. If she happened to meet someone (which of course she did) who could meld with her idea of life then wonderful but she wasn't going to settle for any less than she believed she deserved.This movie is definitely worth seeing. It has it all; action, romance, justice, wit and most importantly well rounded characters that you can empathize with.

I must admit I was not a Stephen King fan, but realized it was an ingenious way to lure people into buying the next installment. I don't remember being overly frightened, nor entertained, when I read them. I guess my imagination isn't that sharp.....it's visual for me. I bought the VHS without hesitation when I saw it - although I'm not a hard-core fan of Tom Hanks, either. The previews for Forest Gump reassured me I would not like that film, because his southern accent was far too forced, and knew I wouldn't get a thrill looking at a gang of contrived scenes upon which he would be pasted - that's acting ?Getting this wonderful film into theaters as quickly as it was done was a major undertaking. Considering its three-hour length, one can get an idea how many miles of wasted film is sitting-around in some vault, unless the first take of every scene was perfect. Don't hold your breath for that when you're dealing with a number of actors in a multitude of scenes, you can bet someone was not quite perfect. The only way to test that is to watch the dailies, hoping 50+ takes aren't wasted film. You can't use it again, like magnetic tape or digital images. Once the film is exposed, that's what you get and is a MAJOR cost for making a film of this length. I never waited with baited breath for a film just because it was being directed by a certain person, edited by a certain person; some actors I watch for new work, but many are often miscast.The beauty of a film - once it is handed to them - IS determined by the skill of the editor. Yet, their work is usually hampered by a dictatorial director, impositions from producers and influence of some of the actors. Unless they can demonstrate a cut would be more valuable to the over-all beauty of the film, their expertise and their foresight usually are disregarded, because they work under extreme scrutiny. Yet, their work is more intense than any other individual working on the film. The raw footage has to be put together, regardless. A good editor can judge where the movie is going, just looking at the film as it is handed to them. Unless he has worked with a director several times, they don't always agree - if they can convince the director to consider another premise, it is this artist who can influence the scenes to be re-shot, even after the film is considered to be in the can. If the director wants to do a re-cut, it's this artist who must remember - or search the unused film - what he saw where and do the actual work. An editor must be a very open-minded, resilient artist.A script is only pages with words on them - how often is the entire script re-written? Who else knew the depth of the characters but Stephen King? Maybe a suggestion here, a suggestion there......he was a natural to write the script. If an actor says what a beautiful script, it is usually said in self-interest, because they must give the words life. True acting-artists have a foresight of the entire film, scene-by-scene, and sacrifices some of his value to allow all of the actors to give their best work, gambling on the finished product will be a film an audience wants to watch. How sad so little mention is given to the person who keeps detailed notations of every detail of the scene - who was where, the last line to be spoken, how the actors looked, etc.....invaluable.....considering what prominent billing is given to cameramen, lighting technicians, set-dressers and myriad other craftsmen.These are only some of the most important protagonists in the making of a movie; if they were female, right on. The credits list the hundreds of other people involved. If some of them say it was fun, it is usually in relief it all came together so quickly, fun being translated into dedicated work. To produce a monumental film such as The Green Mile is, multiply the effort by a thousand.

I'm certain there was much applause on the sets to reward extra-ordinary effort. It is a film to readily cry over, because not only is the story inspiring and magical in every way, it draws the viewer into it to live the story, never having seen the insides of a prison.

When the plot and characters weren't good enough to keep the film interesting, we got crap like Femme Fatale. When, on the other hand, De Palma had an intelligent script and a reliable cast to work with, the result was quite pleasant. MissionImpossible belongs to the second category.Based on the popular TV show from the '60s, the movie starts with Jim Phelps (Jon Voight), leader of IMF (Impossible Mission Force), preventing the latest terrorist plot before receiving a new assignment (This message will self-destruct in five seconds) he has to locate and arrest a double agent. The problem is, his whole team, including himself, gets wiped out during the mission. Only Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is left, which brings his superiors to a logical conclusion he has to be the traitor. Alone and on the run, Hunt has to prove his innocence and find the real dirty agent. He will receive some help from Claire (Emmanuelle Bèart), Jim's wife, computer whiz Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and mercenary Krieger (Jean Reno). An impossible mission? Perhaps...As I already said, this film relies heavily on style, and De Palma artfully delivers when it comes to staging an exciting thriller. Two scenes in particular prove the Scarface director was the right man for the job. One sees Ethan trying to rob a maximum security vault whose alarm basically reacts even if you have to scratch your nose. That scene is loaded with suspense and is one of the best ever directed by De Palma. The other memorable bit is the final set piece (I'll just say three words train, tunnel, chopper), which proves things can really get impossible in these movies.As for content, David Koepp's script is brilliant as long as it deals with the various conspiracies, but rather shallow in terms of character development. Take the IMF team at the beginning they're so hastily introduced it's hard to feel for them when they're all killed five minutes later.

When, on the other hand, De Palma had an intelligent script and a reliable cast to work with, the result was quite pleasant. MissionImpossible belongs to the second category.Based on the popular TV show from the '60s, the movie starts with Jim Phelps (Jon Voight), leader of IMF (Impossible Mission Force), preventing the latest terrorist plot before receiving a new assignment (This message will self-destruct in five seconds) he has to locate and arrest a double agent. The problem is, his whole team, including himself, gets wiped out during the mission. Only Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is left, which brings his superiors to a logical conclusion he has to be the traitor. Alone and on the run, Hunt has to prove his innocence and find the real dirty agent. He will receive some help from Claire (Emmanuelle Bèart), Jim's wife, computer whiz Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and mercenary Krieger (Jean Reno). An impossible mission? Perhaps...As I already said, this film relies heavily on style, and De Palma artfully delivers when it comes to staging an exciting thriller. Two scenes in particular prove the Scarface director was the right man for the job. One sees Ethan trying to rob a maximum security vault whose alarm basically reacts even if you have to scratch your nose. That scene is loaded with suspense and is one of the best ever directed by De Palma. The other memorable bit is the final set piece (I'll just say three words train, tunnel, chopper), which proves things can really get impossible in these movies.As for content, David Koepp's script is brilliant as long as it deals with the various conspiracies, but rather shallow in terms of character development.

Sure, the gimmick of the one-shot movie was an ambitious and challenging experiment that Hitchcock handled the best he could giving us a movie that manages to look as if had been shot in one continuous take. However, Rope is more than a gimmick, and while the technical aspect of the film will always overshadow the rest of the movie, it is without a doubt one of Hitchcock's best films on its own right.Based on Patrick Hamilton's Rope's End, which was loosely inspired by a notorious case of murder; Rope is the story of two men, Brandon (John Dall) and Phillip (Farley Granger), who murder ex-classmate David (Dick Hogan) just for the thrill of it. Brandon, who is so satisfied by his perfect crime, decides to host a party with David0s body hidden in the old chest that serves as table. Among his guests is David's family and his girlfriend, as well as the man that apparently has influenced their lives the most their professor Rupert Cadell (James Stewart), who will try to discover what are his former students hiding.Rope is a film that includes so many elements that to label it as a gimmick film would be a criminal injustice. The most notorious of this elements is the disguised homosexuality latent in the film. While the play was obviously a drama between gay men, Hitchcock and writer Arthur Laurents had to take a subtle approach to avoid studio censorship. The carefully developed screenplay by Laurents is a work of art on its own merit, not only as an adaptation of an existing play, but as a different take on the subject.The cast is superb, and since the cast is formed by only nine persons, Hitchcock makes sure that we know them and sympathize with them. Dall and Granger are superb as the couple of murderers; Dall gives Brandon a sophisticated look that contrasts with his twisted morale and Granger is perfect as the nervous pianist Phillip. James Stewart gives his typical Hitchcocknian interpretation in a low-key performance that serves as the oil that makes the film work. His character works as the detective that must solve the mystery before the party ends, and in fact is a more complex person that what it seems. The rest of the cast complete the picture with legend Cedric Hardwicke and Edith Evanson shining in their small but important roles.Hitchcock makes the movie flow at a good rhythm, something essential for a movie with a small cast and set in a limited space (the entire movie occurs in Brandon's apartment). It has been said that the Master of Suspense planned the movie as a play, and I must say that he succeeded making Rope work even better than a play would do. I don't want to talk too much about the one-shot technique because it has been discussed a lot previously, however, I still feel compelled to praise Hitchcock superb work with the camera. Along with Rear Window, this film captures the voyeur experience and makes the audience part of the party, a witness and accomplice in Brandon and Phillip's crime.Rope is one of those films with no apparent flaw, as everything works like a clock, with all its parts in perfect harmony. If a flaw was to be found, it would be the now-obvious series of cuts that Hitchcock makes to hide his trick. Definitely, one is left to wonder on what would Hitchcock do with modern technology.The excellent screenplay, the top notch performances of the cast, the masterful direction; all these elements make Rope more than a gimmick film. In the end, the one shot trick Hitchcock devised becomes unnoticeable as the plot is so captivating, but that's probably what the Master intended. He wanted Rope to feel like a real time representation of a murder. And once again, he succeeded. 10\/10.

However, as he discovers her habit, he is compelled to help her and save her both from the authorities, and from herself.Marnie says it's a trap, and it is, but what makes this film particularly disturbing is that apparently Sean Connery's Mark is a hero or something. Using only the worst in Freudian psychobabble and a large desire to get into Marnie's skirt, Mark leads her through traumatizing confrontation and traumatizing confrontation until she finally comes to terms with her own repressed memories... which is, apparently, enough to make her love him and go home to him like the happy little housewife she should be.Because see, apparently Marnie being a criminal is completely a result of her weakness and inability to cope with her mother's history, which is in turn necessary for a MAN to figure out. And even though she does not love this man (she never does, at any point in this movie, reveal such a love), his saving her is what is required to have her want to go back home with him. It's disturbing, but not in the good disturbing way like with movies like Requiem for a Dream that are supposed to disturb you away from certain choices, or disturbing like Apocalypse Now which is supposed to paint a gratuitous anti-war picture. It's disturbing because throughout the movie you keep asking yourself, Is Hitchcock really gonna do that? and yes, yes he does. Hitchcock has decided to fully reveal his misogynism.Even beyond that, this movie fails on several levels. Hitchcock uses two effects that are entirely contradictory her fear of red, which is represented in much the same way as the psychosis in Vertigo, and the heavy use of red on the set to represent masculinity like he does in many of his films. But, uh, Hitch if she's afraid of red so that she literally wigs out over a small amount of spilt red on her blouse, why is she not going into seizures surrounded by all the red in Mark's house? Oh, and, uh, why is she wearing red lipstick? Only one moment with the violent reaction to red actually works anyway, and that's the one where she spills the ink because it actually looks like blood, which makes sense. The rest of it is contrived and unbelievable.And speaking of unbelievable, the entire relationship seems completely impossible.

Every horror fan has a certain slasher series they dig, and for me this is it. As a self confessed fanboy, I enjoyed Part 7, especially the Jason that they came up with for this one, all decomposed and hulked out, but I just didn't get on board with it as much as the previous part or the sequel that came after, Jason Takes Manhattan. Both were full of gleeful self-deprecating humour and manic chases, whereas The New Blood is a definite attempt to go back to the series 'Halloween with more violence' roots. It doesn't entirely succeed.I dare say it would have been more successful if the studio had left it the hell alone. In order to get that ever-important R rating, The New Blood was (ironically, I suppose) butchered, with almost every horrific thing that happens in this movie being either curtailed or removed entirely. With the exception of a few scenes, this movie has been almost totally sanitised. So, we have a movie that unavoidably feels incomplete, which it is, having had half of most of the scares taken out by unscrupulous editors. Add to this the fact that the movie isn't paced well, and drags a lot in certain parts, and Jason 7 is probably one of my least favourite Jason movies.Still, even with the series trademark gore exorcised by Paramount, and a story that drags because it's busy setting everything up again, The New Blood is still a solid slasher movie, with some memorable scenes and a nice (if totally predictable for series fans) twist at the end. Some of the less massacred kill sequences are impressively inventive, with one particular scene sticking in my mind involving someones eye and a clown horn, and the movie keeps a decent bit of tension going throughout.It isn't the best Jason movie (that's probably Part 6 Jason Lives) but it's better than the worst ones, like the inexcusably bad Jason Goes to Hell or the recent Freddy vs Jason. If you're going to watch the Friday movies and haven't started yet, this could be a good way in, as it seems to be cheaper than the first ones in most countries (for some reason, despite there being nothing on the disk, Friday the 13th Part 1 is always really expensive, rent or otherwise), and it readdresses the whole plot during the opening segment, so you could do as well to start here as the beginning.

It doesn't entirely succeed.I dare say it would have been more successful if the studio had left it the hell alone. In order to get that ever-important R rating, The New Blood was (ironically, I suppose) butchered, with almost every horrific thing that happens in this movie being either curtailed or removed entirely. With the exception of a few scenes, this movie has been almost totally sanitised. So, we have a movie that unavoidably feels incomplete, which it is, having had half of most of the scares taken out by unscrupulous editors. Add to this the fact that the movie isn't paced well, and drags a lot in certain parts, and Jason 7 is probably one of my least favourite Jason movies.Still, even with the series trademark gore exorcised by Paramount, and a story that drags because it's busy setting everything up again, The New Blood is still a solid slasher movie, with some memorable scenes and a nice (if totally predictable for series fans) twist at the end. Some of the less massacred kill sequences are impressively inventive, with one particular scene sticking in my mind involving someones eye and a clown horn, and the movie keeps a decent bit of tension going throughout.It isn't the best Jason movie (that's probably Part 6 Jason Lives) but it's better than the worst ones, like the inexcusably bad Jason Goes to Hell or the recent Freddy vs Jason. If you're going to watch the Friday movies and haven't started yet, this could be a good way in, as it seems to be cheaper than the first ones in most countries (for some reason, despite there being nothing on the disk, Friday the 13th Part 1 is always really expensive, rent or otherwise), and it readdresses the whole plot during the opening segment, so you could do as well to start here as the beginning.

I believe that it was Brian Aldiss that once said of science fiction the trick is not to explain everything. it sure works here for this film! if you think about it, even the simple title predator, doesn't give away much. If you have never seen this film or talked to anybody that has about it (if you lived in a cave, perhaps) the title would trow you off. Predator... what kind of predator? Who, or what is the predator? the humans, to begin with (the commando team), but soon after the ultimate killing machine steps in.The story doesn't wallow pointlessly into the origins of the creature. It, quite unapologetically, shows that it came from outer space, and that should be enough. The premise is simple it came to earth, it's different from us and it feels no remorse, got it? No pseudo-philosophies on are we alone in the universe or it came in peace or some crap like that. It delivers the story of the hunter being hunted. Period.As for character development, it goes without saying that it's remarkably sparse but effective; it gives some insight into their experiences, but in a bonding kind of way, without referring to combat trauma, shell shock or other problems posed incessantly by other films. It's enough to be believable, like in Alien. You can tell who's best bud's with each other. It's not a soap opera, it's just an action film! The acting is well all around, considering that this is not a very dramatically demanding story for anybody (and the fact that neither are particularly gifted actors). The script is precise, it doesn't force the cast to act stupid, or insults the intelligence of the audience; another reason why it works! It never tries to explain much, it sure leaves open questions at the end, but you don't get that feeling of a plot hole in the story.The visuals are stunning. The art direction turns the jungle into an enemy on its own accord, shooting at highly tilted angles to give you a sense of isolation, of how small you are, of something lurking in the trees, that you are being watched. While this is only suggested in the first half of the film, it becomes clear that it is really the case in the second part.The story is simple and convincing. The plot actually gives you a reason for the commandos to be there, it's not a typical they went into the jungle after some Axe murderer to get chopped to bits kind of thing. We are led to believe that it's a rescue mission and get that feeling of betrayal when we find out the real purpose.The creature is amazing; applause to Stan Winston and also James Cameron (he suggested the fangs thingy). An alien that doesn't just seem to be fetched out of the star trek reject bin. Doesn't look like a human in a Halloween costume at all. Like the creature from Alien, this is totally refreshing and original. Plus, it carries the most spectacular apparatus of killing contraptions ever devised on film. It seem like a daemon, at times, because it's in in for the kill. But that just goes to show what happens when you are not at the top of the food chain.John Mctiernan delivered an absolute gem with this one. The pacing is superb, the photography (by Donald McAlpine)is brilliant; he turns the somewhat dull green environment of the jungle into a character of its own. The editing is master full, taking you where the story wants to, driving you into a crescendo of fear (that part when Carl Weathers bites the big one come to mind!).Definitely Ah-nuld's best!

All the characters are cool, and so many crazy\/hilarious things happen in this film, plus Elisabeth Shue is simply amazing in this!. One of the funniest moments in the film for me was when Sara(Brewton) gets revenge on Brad(Coogan) for calling Thor a homo, by threatening to tell Chris(Shue) about the love poem's he wrote her right when she was behind Brad! plus, that Baby Sitting Blues song cracked me up!. It's very well made and written, and while I wish Chris and Brad got together at the end, the ending was still satisfying, plus It's fun for the whole family!. The finale is especially fun, and the whole cast seemed to be having a ball, and rightfully so, plus this should be a lot higher then 6.2 in my opinion. It's also good natured, and It would have been a cool if they made a sequel to this, but sadly that didn't happen, plus I would also love for a special DVD edition of this!. This is excellent 80's fun, that's extremely entertaining and quite hilarious, with a highly fun story and equally fun performances, and I say it's a must see for everyone!. The Direction is excellent!. Chris Columbus does an excellent! job here with wonderful camera work, fantastic angles, and just keeping the film hilarious and at an extremely fast pace. The Acting is a lot of fun!. Elisabeth Shue is amazing as always and is amazing here, she is incredibly gorgeous, extremely likable, and very winning in her 1st major role, she had great comic timing, had good chemistry with all of the kids, and was just so charming, I loved her performance here! (Shue Rules!!!!!!!). Maia Brewton is great as the younger sister, she was surprisingly cute and funny, and non annoying, she had some great energy, I loved her!. Keith Coogan is hilarious as Brad, who's in love with Chris, he was dorky but in a good way, I couldn't help but love him, especially whenever he stood up for her, I just wished he and Chris were together at the end. Anthony Rapp is hilarious as the best friend of Brad's he was goofy but likable, he did great, and added a lot of fun that was already there!. Calvin Levels is funny as Joe Gipp the car thief, I dug him. Penelope Ann Miller is funny as Chris's best friend Brenda, I liked her. Rest of the cast are fine.

Best of all is veteran screen star Ralph Bellamy (THE AWFUL TRUTH, HIS GIRL Friday) who (at age 86) is funny and touching as Gere's business nemesis\/father figure.

By far the best to come out of this program was 'Silent Running', an ecologically-minded 'message film' that stands out today as one of the truly great films of the science-fiction genre.Bruce Dern stars as Freeman Lowell, a futuristic Park Ranger minding Earth's last forests, sealed in gigantic domes aboard an equally gigantic freighter in space. When ordered to destroy the domes and return home, Lowell is forced to choose between his crewmates and his beloved forests.The motif of a polluted, or simply, homogenized Earth, the ultimate triumph of human progress over nature and wilderness, is a standard theme of science fiction in the 20th century, and the film is not too different from many other films and episodic television programs seen since the postwar period. Rarely, however, has the theme been explored from the point of view of ecological ethics. The storyline is kept deliberately simple, and asks not the question 'How Would You Act In Such A Position', it merely shows how one particular man might. The characters are given seminal, yet subtle opportunities to flesh themselves out (comments made during meals and card games are particularly noteworthy), and even if the character of Lowell is ultimately dislikeable, he remains oddly sympathetic. Dern produces a remarkable performance here, as a tortured, perhaps even mentally-ill, loner. His work here is still fresh and understated and certainly not of the over-the-top calibre, despite the insistances of some.The film possesses truly amazing visual images, from the spacecraft itself (the decommissioned and soon-to-be-scrapped aircraft carrier Valley Forge) to the domes (an aircraft hanger at Van Nuys Airport) to the unforgettable Drones, uncanny little robots designed around the amputee-actors that give them life. Visual effects are excellent, the direct prototypes of even more fantastical films to come. The music, composed for the film by Peter Schickele (known internationally as P.D.Q. Bach), is by turns boldly triumphant, softly mournful, and is quite effective; some viewers may hate the vocal work of Joan Baez, but she is a logical choice for this production and time period.While many films have suffered since the release of 'Star Wars'(which is NOT, strictly speaking, science-fiction) due to dated visuals and obsolete effects technology, 'Silent Running' is still startlingly clean and visionary.

By far the best to come out of this program was 'Silent Running', an ecologically-minded 'message film' that stands out today as one of the truly great films of the science-fiction genre.Bruce Dern stars as Freeman Lowell, a futuristic Park Ranger minding Earth's last forests, sealed in gigantic domes aboard an equally gigantic freighter in space. When ordered to destroy the domes and return home, Lowell is forced to choose between his crewmates and his beloved forests.The motif of a polluted, or simply, homogenized Earth, the ultimate triumph of human progress over nature and wilderness, is a standard theme of science fiction in the 20th century, and the film is not too different from many other films and episodic television programs seen since the postwar period. Rarely, however, has the theme been explored from the point of view of ecological ethics. The storyline is kept deliberately simple, and asks not the question 'How Would You Act In Such A Position', it merely shows how one particular man might. The characters are given seminal, yet subtle opportunities to flesh themselves out (comments made during meals and card games are particularly noteworthy), and even if the character of Lowell is ultimately dislikeable, he remains oddly sympathetic. Dern produces a remarkable performance here, as a tortured, perhaps even mentally-ill, loner. His work here is still fresh and understated and certainly not of the over-the-top calibre, despite the insistances of some.The film possesses truly amazing visual images, from the spacecraft itself (the decommissioned and soon-to-be-scrapped aircraft carrier Valley Forge) to the domes (an aircraft hanger at Van Nuys Airport) to the unforgettable Drones, uncanny little robots designed around the amputee-actors that give them life. Visual effects are excellent, the direct prototypes of even more fantastical films to come. The music, composed for the film by Peter Schickele (known internationally as P.D.Q. Bach), is by turns boldly triumphant, softly mournful, and is quite effective; some viewers may hate the vocal work of Joan Baez, but she is a logical choice for this production and time period.While many films have suffered since the release of 'Star Wars'(which is NOT, strictly speaking, science-fiction) due to dated visuals and obsolete effects technology, 'Silent Running' is still startlingly clean and visionary. A worthy film for all science-fiction fans to see.

The biggest problem was that each new action movie that came along was trying to out-bang the one before. There's only so far you can go with spectacular stunts and explosions. There has to come a point when you hit a kind of ceiling and the only direction left is back down. By 1997 action movie makers had hit this ceiling and were merely churning out film after film that had virtually the same plot. The actors and the backgrounds may have varied from movie to movie, but the general essence remained identical - and therein lay the staleness. That's why Face\/Off is such an enjoyable action movie. It manages to sock across a new plot - something different to the norm, something not seen before - and the result is a sense of freshness that is rare for the genre.Special agent Sean Archer (John Travolta) is devastated when his young son Michael is killed by a sniper's bullet meant for him. The sniper was psycho Castor Troy (Nicholas Cage), and Archer subsequently dedicates his life to tracking down and nailing this rotten villain. After many years, Archer finally catches up with his nemesis at an L.A. airfield. The encounter ends with Castor being thrown into a wall by the force of a jet engine, an event which leaves him in a coma. All is not as well as one might expect, as before being rendered comatose Castor planted a time bomb, capable of vaporising everything within a square mile, somewhere in the city. The only person who knows the location of the bomb is Castor's paranoid, imprisoned brother Pollux (Alessandro Nivola), but with his big brother indefinitely unconscious there seems no hope of Pollux giving away his secret. Archer is persuaded to undergo radical surgery that will allow him to look like Castor - to literally wear his body and face - so that he can go to jail posing as Troy, and get the truth out of unsuspecting Pollux. But the plan backfires when Archer (now, bizarrely, played by Cage) is undercover in prison.... for the real Castor (now played by Travolta) comes out of his coma and turns the table on his adversary. The good guy is trapped in jail and the only people who know his true identity are killed; meanwhile the bad guy is out on the streets being hailed by everyone as a national hero!Face\/Off is totally absurd, but a lot of fun. The absurdness is almost deliberate, like an outrageous catalyst used to kick-start the ensuing proceedings. Cage and Travolta have a tremendous time aping each other's character once their faces have been switched; Nivola is twitchy to a fault as Castor's hyper-anxious brother; and Joan Allen has a super role as Archer's understandably bewildered wife. John Woo orchestrates the action very cleverly, with his usual slow motion flourishes, and some hair-raising sequences. There are occasional talky moments that teeter somewhere between tedium and melodrama, but when the pyrotechnics take over Woo delivers the goods. Face\/Off is a very enjoyable actioner, just outlandish enough to be an effective cliché-breaker.

It was something that I could laugh at rather than take seriously. I tried after a few minutes more but it's hard to take Leonardo DiCaprio who I believe is a very talented actor and Clare Dane who is just as talented playing in modern times. We know nobody talks like that. If they had adapted Romeo and Juliet to more modern language, I think I would have bared the film in general. But the language and the modern day scenery do not mix well for me. I'm old fashioned I guess in general. I know the director wanted something different for Romeo and Juliet. Few films can beat the 1968 version with Olivia Hussey and this film would not be very welcome if I was teaching Romeo and Juliet. It's too far fetched and ridiculous. I know it's modernized for the audience. But I like my Shakespeare to be precise and old fashioned. I love Miriam Margolyes as the nurse and Christina Pickles as one of the mothers but it just doesn't feel right. Mercutio's supposed to be a drag queen which I felt was really something that made my stomach turn in general was out of this world. It's not for me and I accept that. If there are others happy with it, so be it but not for me.
