Hey up there, what are you thinking? OK, just here me out here for a second.Lets talk about Toy Story. It was the first completely 3-D movie ever made, truly a milestone in cinematic history. Sure, compared to the dazzling beauty of Final Fantasy and Shrek it may look dated, but its still a classic. Nothing can take that away from it.Toy Story 2 as a movie, not a sequel, is good. There are a few minor adjustments made to the animation to make it appear better but Woody, Buzz etc. wouldn't exist if it weren't for the original. First off, I think TS2 is a bit too long and overdrawn for an animated movie. Buzz could have been used a little more than he was, and the Emperor Zurg sub-plot was slightly bizzare and un-necessary.I liked the way the original was a buddy-buddy comedy which wasn't serious and didn't involve a romance as the basic plot. In TS2 it was way too predictable that Woody and Jessie would fall in love. The rendition of When She Loved Me was the films downfall and an obvious flaw. It was totally un-needed and made the film more serious than it should have been.Jessie the Cowgirl (Joan Cusack) was somewhat, a boring character and shouldn't have been used at all. Stinky Pete (Kelsey Grammar) never made a big impact and was a wasted chance. Buzz (Tim Allen) is as good as he was in the original but seemed too much like the supporting cast in this one. Mr. Potato Head, Rex, Slinky and Ham shuld have been used more. When the cast is too big the best characters don't get enough screentime. One thing the movie needed was a character that would bring chuckles everytime he\/she spoke ie. Donkey in Shrek.Overall this is an adequate movie but an unsatisfactory sequel which seems to be aimed more at children than adults. 5 out of 10.

After taking a frienly stroll down the Lost highway make sure to turn off onto Mulholland Drive, one single street that could fuel all of your greatest nightmares, if it even exists at all. Sometimes you have to scratch your head and wonder where director David Lynch was trying to fo with Blue Velvet and Lost Highway, well wherever it was her is finally there. Few directors posess their own sense of identity, but Lynch is one that does. If you are familliar with his work you don't come out of his movies saying that was weird you come out of his movies saying that was Lynch. The actors in his movies get into their characters so deeply that they could probably tell the story without muttering a single word. But no matter how many characters Lynch packs into his script or how well he develops them, it is not about the characters, it is about the surreal universe they exist in and the wide spectrum of possibility they are given, which is not possible without the brillant touch from our man of the hour, David Lynch. Roger Ebert said he doesn't reccomend this film to anyone who requires logic, leading people to believe that there is none present. But I must say I feel exactly the opposite, Lynch's mezmorizing script possesses so much logic that trying to pick it apart would be like trying to cut cement with a plastic butter knife. What we have here is the complex story of Betty and Rita, a broke diretor and a mysterious cowboy. Betty is an innocent looking blong who wants to become a big star, Rita is a sultry brunette who can't remember who she is after escaping assassination due to a violent car crash on Mulholland Drive. We also have a director who just got fired, found his wife in bed with another man and is flat out broke. But things begin to change for him after a cowboy tells him to cast Betty as the lead role in his new movie. Betty and Rita also begin a lesbian love affair, as the memories slowly come back and we slowly slip into a bottomless pit of weirdness. The ending is typical as you won't have a clue to what has happened but unlike Lost Highway, with close enough inspection this one canbe figured out. For everyone who saw Vanillia Sky and wondered what it would be like to not be able to tell the difference between a dream and reality should watch a Lynch film, you will probably need someone to pinch you to make sure that you haven't slipped away into your own private dreamscape and really when it comes down to it that's what it's all about, dreams. First we question the destiny of these girls, then we question the fate of these girls, then finally we question the existiance of these girls. The film was pegged as an erotic thriller and where most films today with that lable fail to capture erotism or thrills, Lynch does both to perfection with his weird and obscure method of camera work and offbeat lighting he manages to send more than a few chills down your spine and the love scene between Betty and Rita is so hot I had to stop and wipe the steam off my TV screen. Although the film is less dark than Blue Velvetand less disturbing than Lost HIghway it meets both films right in the middle of the spectrun to make for the best of the three. Lynch got an Oscar nomination for his astounding direction and the film made many a critic's top ten lists and in some cases was even said to be the best film of the year. With that much hype can the film really live up to what it promises? The answer is yes, not only does it live up to the hype it exceeds it, excelling itself right up the latter of perfection.

Surprisingly, the movie has a very simple basic story. In a little warped town, known as Halloween town, lives Jack Skelington. Jack, aka the Pumpkin King, grows tired and bored of his role in the world, organizing Halloween each year. So, he goes in search of something new and different to do to end his slump. He discovers Christmas town, and decides he wants to do that instead. From the start, its pretty obvious that the citizens or Halloween town can't do Christmas and begin warping and dementing it totally out of recognition. there is also a sub plot about a patchwork girl who is also trying to escape her role in the world. She is falls in love with Jack from a far. Anymore and I would spoil it.The plot, simple fairy tale, a bit of human quality ie trying to escape the boring blue collar life. but, really the plot has very little to do with what makes this movie special.It's the breath-taking 3D stop-motion animation! This is the very first movie to consist completely of stop motion. Probably the most grueling film technique ever, stop motion requires small figures that are positioned then photographed then repositioned and rephotograped over and over. This process is takes hours to create even a minute of footage. So, that explains alot about why each shot is so well crafted, since they spent weeks puting them together. This technique makes it very original, and very unique In a time when most movies were trying new computer animation and looking for a more realistic look. the filmmakers choice to go back to the herky jerky look of stop motion, was a bold and very different idea.A work of genius!Some of the things you will notice is there aren't really that many charactors. halloween town really has only about 10 or 15 residents, probably because the cost of creating hundreds of little firgures for every expression and movement they have. Jack alone probably had over 600 heads, for all the movements of his face. but, even with limitations like these, the movie succeeds in just about everything I think it set out to do. Its creepy and weird, scary and warped, yet has a kind of strange nice feeling. You have empathy for the charactors, even though they are dark and crazy. And if for no other reason, watch this movie for the cinematography. The sets are wonderful, the characters are cool looking, the music is great, and every shot is masterful. I find it easy just to forget the story and watch the pretty pictures.Is it a halloween spooky movie, or a warm christmas classic? who cares, its cool to watch! Tim Burton is truly a cinematic genius for coming up with such a fantastic idea and make a fantastic film out of it! He should, in 10 years times, receive an honourary Academy Award for his brilliant film career. With a film like this he should be very proud of what he has achieved  in this film alone!

Surprisingly, the movie has a very simple basic story. In a little warped town, known as Halloween town, lives Jack Skelington. Jack, aka the Pumpkin King, grows tired and bored of his role in the world, organizing Halloween each year. So, he goes in search of something new and different to do to end his slump. He discovers Christmas town, and decides he wants to do that instead. From the start, its pretty obvious that the citizens or Halloween town can't do Christmas and begin warping and dementing it totally out of recognition. there is also a sub plot about a patchwork girl who is also trying to escape her role in the world. She is falls in love with Jack from a far. Anymore and I would spoil it.The plot, simple fairy tale, a bit of human quality ie trying to escape the boring blue collar life. but, really the plot has very little to do with what makes this movie special.It's the breath-taking 3D stop-motion animation! This is the very first movie to consist completely of stop motion. Probably the most grueling film technique ever, stop motion requires small figures that are positioned then photographed then repositioned and rephotograped over and over. This process is takes hours to create even a minute of footage. So, that explains alot about why each shot is so well crafted, since they spent weeks puting them together.

And of course, who can forget the brilliant villainy brought to the screen by our favorite Paul Newman. With beautiful set direction, out of this world designs (like Robbins' fresh idea, you know, for kids), this film deserves more praise than it has been given.

In part, I was right, I suppose. Ben Affleck provides very typical American smouldering-but-wooden star fare, in fact he was disappointingly off his best form, not that it would have made much difference since the fella could never have made himself look all that great when paired with Morgan Freeman, who produced the sort of fantastic role that we have come to expect of the film legend. But did the film fall victim to the temptation of a 'Stars and Stripes' flag-waving-fest, a sort of Pearl Harbour amplified by the emotions of the war on terror? Yes and No. Of course, the film leaves you with a very serious concern about nuclear proliferation and global terrorism - probably just what Cheney, Rumsfield and co. would love us to be feeling right now - and the film evokes a very palpable poignancy with lines such as 'there has been a terrorist attack on America' which clearly plays on the 'gulp factor'. However, the film is far from merely a shameless wallowing in national pride in the wake of terrorism. Let us not forget that the villains of the piece are primarily Europeans, not Arabs, and the film breaks fresh ground in acknowledging the US's own culpability for the spread of nuclear weapons outside the superpowers. Above all else, the film - in particular the sound and cinematography, which should both get Oscars - is captivating, and it is a rare thing indeed that I have actually been moved by a film as much as I was two-thirds of the way through this one. The Baltimore episode left me absolutely awestruck - to be honest I just didn't see it coming - and really quite emotionally drained. Such a catharsis is just not something you expect from a self-proclaimed action thriller 'Sum of All Fears'. A few loose ends around the edges demand a slight willing suspension of disbelief, but it is a suspension I for one was more than willing to give after the middle section of the film. As well as the usual top class performance from Freeman, Liev Schreiber was for me a surprise class act, capturing a character few films have focussed on in the 'invisible' secret agent.

The line up here includes a very promising cast of Steven Dourff as Leon, Brad Renfro as Bobby, Matt Dillon as Fritzy, Frankie Muniz as Scooch and Johnny Knoxville as Vince. But with all those characters comes very little character developementand leaves us with a full cast of characters that we don't care about with the small exception of Leon. We start the film with the death of Leon's brother and the imprisonment of Marko, the rival gang leader who gave his brother the drugs that killed him. Fast forward three years, Marko is out of jail and all hell is breaking loose on Leon's once peaceful block, Marko is also making a deal with Fritzy (the head of the block) to get his drugs back on the street and Leon's brother Bobby is becoming involved with the sister of a Viper. This film has everything, the rival gangs (Outsiders), the big show downs (Last Man Standing), the gangster who is in charge of everything (Bronx Tale) and the drug dealing (Goodfellas). But because of this the flim is robbed of any sort of self identity and becomes rather bogged down and boring, leading up to a conclusion that is inevidable because we have all seen it a hundred times before, just better. This film could have been a masterpeice were it put into the proper hands, but Scott Calvert is no Martin Scorsese and Matt Dillon is no Robert De Niro, so we are left satisfied to some extent, but still feel robbed of something. The lackluster direction and enormously cliched script don't help matters any. It's clear director Scott Calvert tried his hardest to be clever but his annoying camera tricks don't suit this movie well at all, in fact some of them are, at time, very hard to watch. The fight scenes are plentiful but lack any excitement due to the horrible choreograhpy and again cheesy camera movement making it hard to tell who is who. Matt Dillon show plenty of promise but is only given four scenes in the whole movie, Johnny Knoxville is a nobody that serves no importance and is hardly noticable and Frankie Muniz hardly mutters a word the whole time. I have always found Steven Dourff to have possessed a certain degree of talent but he has yet to be given a role where he can break free and show us what he is really made of, but he is still, by far, the highlight of the film. Now don't get me wrong, the movie is not a total waste and there are probably lots of people that this sort of thing will appeal to but its lack of originality cancels out any power of emotion and even though we have a cast of characters that I really didn't care about except for Leon, it's an hour and a half of my life that I don't regret.
