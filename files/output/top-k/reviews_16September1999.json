I will also say something even (possibly) bolder--that Kevin Spacey gives the performance of his career. And all us movie geeks know that is saying a LOT, given this man's past roles, and his talent. I used to think he was overrated as an actor. Then I figured OK, I see what all the fuss is about. Now, he's up there with my favorite actors of all time, with James Woods, Steve Buscemi, Robert Deniro...probably in the top 5. I was lucky enough to see a free screening this afternoon and boy, am I glad I had the privilege. In fact, this review might not even be that coherent- it's one of those movies that blows you away so much that you have trouble even putting your feelings into words. The plotline sounds trite when you first describe it (it did to me when I first heard about it), Spacey plays a man who describes himself as a loser, with Annette Bening as his horrible, shrewish, self-absorbed, pathetic b*tch of a wife. His daughter is not all that likeable either, despite the fact that you can understand why she turned out this way, with her as a mother. Just when you think you've met the most dysfunctional family in the world outside of Happiness, you find out about the family who just moved in next door. At first, the strange son seems like the most messed-up member of their brood, but after you get to meet his ex-military, abusive, homophobic, terrifying father and his withdrawn, sad, headcase mother, you realize he is the most normal member of the household by far. Then, the filmwriters toss in Kevin Spacey's lustful obsession with his daughter's sexkitten cheerleader friend, which trust me, is a lot more fun, entertaining, and amusing than it sounds when you read about it. Soon, he is having the most entertaining, amusing midlife crisis ever seen in the history of cinema. He just doesn't give a ***k about what he does or says anymore, and you only wish you could get away with doing the things he does.I found myself laughing out loud in this movie so many times, most of it horrified, amazed laughter at what is happening and the things that are coming out of the character's mouths, especially Spacey's. He had at least a dozen lines that had every member of the audience in hysterics and actual applause and cheers. I can't say enough good things about this movie. You think, after the first five minutes, that you know how the movie will end. Well, Spacey's opening narrative does give it away, but trust me, the events unfold in a way that you will NEVER see coming. You will swear you can see what a character is going to do next, what violent or self-destructice act they will commit, but you turn out to be wrong.Without getting too pretentious here, the movie lives up to it's theme\/tagline of ...look closer. THe characters are not what they seem, up until the end, and even then they surprise you. At least two characters that you are POSITIVE you have figured out, do or say something that turns all your preconceptions of them upside down, while making your jaw drop, and your heart ache. You will leave the movie with a smile, though, and that is maybe what I expected least of all.Words just cannot do this movie justice. See it for yourself.

He exudes quiet authority, in a similar way to Alec Guiness in the original trilogy, and there is some great chemistry between him and Shmi. Nobody gives an epic  performance, but then they're not supposed to.Jar-Jar. Hmmm. Not keen. I found him annoying, more so than the Ewoks or the Jawas. Clearly aimed at the kids, who do tend to love him, but he got on my nerves with the silly voice and the slapstick humour which marked the whole film in the same way as the Endor battle in Jedi. Jar-Jar even hits himself with  a bolas in the same way as Wicket. Unforgivable.All in all, well worth seeing and can be enjoyed in it's own right. But it certainly does well in laying the scene for the next two, which I personally can't wait to see.Oh yes, and the special effects are good if you like that sort of thing.

After seeing this remade version, I came away satisfied.  Hearing what countless critics had to say has never changed my view.  Of course, it can never come even close to the novel, but watching Lyne's version unfold in quiet and somber light brought to mind the exact same feelings I was experiencing reading the book.   Certain things did bother me.  Lolita's mother in particular.  Hearing Melanie Griffith deliver lines as if she were reading to a group of school children set my teeth on edge, although she went down in fine style.  And having the sole reason for Humbert's obsession with nymphets wrapped up in one neat reason(Annabel) was also hard to swallow. But Dominique Swain was nearly the perfect picture of the Lolita in my mind. Wistful, vulnerable, and a fierce manipulator all at once, it's hard to believe she'd never had acting experience beforehand.  Perhaps a bit too old in certain lights, she still managed to carry off a difficult role and steal every scene she was in, much like Natalie Portman in Beautiful Girls.  Certain expressions were incredibly poignant. (Think of Lo's face when Humbert denied permission to be in the play.  Think of her lipstick smeared smile after being caught going out when Humbert went to the market). The essence of this movie is what formed my opinion that this was a good film.  The pacing, the comparison to Kubrick didn't matter when the mood of the entire film was left.   Maybe the critics are right, and I'm missing something.

And, it was done an injustice by being made under The Crow name, which drew the inevitable, damning comparisons to the original, which is well on its way to being a modern classic. But, if you can just forget about the first one for 2 hours, this a completely enjoyable, immersive film that you can easily get lost in.It details the story of Ashe Corven, a young mechanic who, along with his son, is shot and thrown into a river after witnessing a murder. As is the custom in the Crow series, he is brought back by a mysterious Crow to make his killers pay for what they did.Vincent Perez's Ashe is, in my opinion, a completely different character from Brandon Lee's Eric Draven, which says something for Perez since he had to work with a very similar script. When Eric was brought back in the first one, he was initially quite insane, but he was originally able to regain his composure and adopt a more menacingly calm demeanor. As he never regains his sanity. He is completely insane for almost the entire movie. If I were put in his situation, I would probably be more like Ashe than Eric, so this made the character more believable, at least to me. I'll be perfectly honest, I didn't much like the other members of the cast, except for the beautiful and talented Mia Kirshner, and, surprisingly, Iggy Pop, who does an excellent job as one of Ashe's killers.One thing they could have implemented a little better was the romance between Ashe and Sarah. We were given just a brief glimpse of this, just enough to let us know that they were in love. If this could be shown to be a deeper romance, it would have really set this one apart from the first, presenting Perez's character with the moral choice of avenging his son, or forsaking him in favor of Sarah. Seeing as Ashe tells us that his son's mother was a drug addict who ran off after his son was born, it would be a great chance for the character to find the love that he might never have had. But, alas, the production was rushed, and this just was not explored to my satisfaction.So, overall, if you can accept that this movie is a different movie, even with all the similarities, you will be able to watch it and enjoy it.

As he never regains his sanity. He is completely insane for almost the entire movie. If I were put in his situation, I would probably be more like Ashe than Eric, so this made the character more believable, at least to me. I'll be perfectly honest, I didn't much like the other members of the cast, except for the beautiful and talented Mia Kirshner, and, surprisingly, Iggy Pop, who does an excellent job as one of Ashe's killers.One thing they could have implemented a little better was the romance between Ashe and Sarah. We were given just a brief glimpse of this, just enough to let us know that they were in love. If this could be shown to be a deeper romance, it would have really set this one apart from the first, presenting Perez's character with the moral choice of avenging his son, or forsaking him in favor of Sarah. Seeing as Ashe tells us that his son's mother was a drug addict who ran off after his son was born, it would be a great chance for the character to find the love that he might never have had. But, alas, the production was rushed, and this just was not explored to my satisfaction.So, overall, if you can accept that this movie is a different movie, even with all the similarities, you will be able to watch it and enjoy it. Keep an open mind with this one.

Watching how Martin and his motley crew of wannabes pull it off kept us laughing.Steve Martin did well because he did not try to get laughs doing slapstick but let the premise be funny on its own. Eddie Murphy was enjoyable for once because he was not the mainstay of the show. Most of his I will play 10 roles myself movies stink in my opinion. How a star can be so entranced with himself to think he can be all thing to all people is beyond me. In this movie he played two roles well. He became the buttress the other stars and situations could butt up againstSecondarily the whole movie was a satire of Hollywood. Locklear changing sleeping partners every time it furthered her career. Aspiring actors and actresses dreaming of being in film even when they don't even get paid. A producer so desperate to succeed that he would do anything to produce a hit.Throw in a few illegal aliens recruited during a firefight to be moviehands and you get a funny film.

But they don't show any of the real wacky stuff that has happened, or made references to anything that happens that has really made the Stern show known.Howard Stern's life was well acted out, and well scripted.
