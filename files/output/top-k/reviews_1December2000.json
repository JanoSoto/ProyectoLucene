[{"date":"1 December 2000","score":"","review":"  When I saw the trailers for this movie, I was mildly interested, but I was putting in 65+  hour weeks when it came out, so I missed it in the theatres. By the time I rented it, I had heard so much hype about the movie that I was really energized to see it.  The movie came as a massive disappointment.In retrospect, I've decided that it was an okay science fiction film. Absolutely off-the-shelf plot, largely wooden acting (with exceptions, of course), spruced up by a few nice and cutting-edge special effects. Eminently watchable, if one likes scifi and approaches it un-biased.Unfortunately, it is tough to approach the film unbiased because of the utterly insane amount of hype that followed its release.  One of the most annoying things I keep hearing about the film is how new and original it was.  I cannot adequately express my opinion of this nonsense without resorting to profanity, but I will try.As far back as DesCartes, the idea that we may be living a lie and that all we think we know is being put into her head put into our heads by an outside force.  Since that time, it has been in almost constant use by science fiction writers.  The Matrix plot is neither new, nor even a new interpretation of an old idea.  It is simply an old idea.The acting had its shining moments, but between the actors and the script, there was never really a shot at greatness.Cinematically, aside from a few very eye-catching shots, the movie descends into a series of largely boring and formulaic slow-motion shots.The effects?  Well, aside from the new (and, admittedly, spectacular freeze-panning effects), they were somewhere at or below the level of episodic television, especially those which occur in the nominal real world.Plot holes?  Enough of them, and big enough, to drive a fleet of Mac Trucks through.  Insanely huge example follows, but, be advised, it does contain big SPOILERS if you don't know the plot.  If you don't want the spoilers, skip to the next paragraph.  Okay, I warned you.  All the humans in the world are tied into this virtual reality to keep them passive while their body heat is used to power a giant evil computer.  Why humans? Why waste all that time creating the virtual reality, when they could just use a whole bunch of chained up squirels?  I'll tell you why because the creators had this great idea about people stuck in virtual reality, and couldn't come up with a good reason why, so they just slapped something together, that's why.Perhaps the worst thing about this movie, is that it has ruined a lot of scifi that has followed.  Anytime a fight scene features an attempt at actual martial arts choreography, or uses any slow motion in a fight scene, it is decried as a Matrix rip-off (often with the term blatant thrown in), as if Kung Fu and over-crank were invented for the Matrix.  Even worse is that the technological aspects that the Matrix borrows from scifi canon are now decribed as being Matrix rip-offs too.Anyway, here's the summation line this is a watchable, and often enough enjoyable movie, that suffers from being extremely over-valued.

He never dreamed in a million years he'd end up fighting for his life, which is exactly what happens.Caught off-guard post-argument with Holly, and pre-completion of an after-flight freshening-up session, (the phrase making fists with your toes was made for trivia heaven!), he becomes every screenwriter's dream of the perfect action hero an ordinary guy caught in extraordinary circumstances with the ability to rise to the occasion. When Nakatomi Plaza (actually Fox's Century City offices) is taken over by terrorists, McClain forgets marital woes and declares martial law in a one-man war against the armed intruders.Big, belligerent and boisterous, this was the action thriller at its most Hollywood-outlandish, but one of the main things going for it is what most thrillers that followed came up missing characters we care about. Willis' McClain is a wiseacre hard-ass with a smart-mouthed crack for even the diciest situation, (honed by his years on MOONLIGHTING), but unlike AH-nuld, he is no Superman, and even as we laugh at the Wiley Coyote scrapes he gets himself into, we wince simultaneously at every-near miss, be it flying bullets or free-falls through umpteen story windows, and cheer each time his pluck and determination to get the bad guys and save his missus, brings him through.John McTiernan, who made his career with this film, (and was deathly afraid of heights while shooting it!) doesn't waste a single opportunity given him by the script to turn all the action set pieces up to ELEVEN! Michael Kamen's Sturm-und-Drang scoring does some nifty things with Christmas carols and Beethoven's Ode To Joy that were so original, everyone's been ripping off the score ever since, (including Kamen himself!)Best of all, though, is the note-perfect casting job. Besides Willis, British stage vet Alan Rickman oozed oily charm, unctuous ambition and tons of bad attitude as lead terrorist Hans Gruber, who matched Bruce for every thrust and parry in their scenes together, both physically and verbally. Best of all, it's easy to see in the scenes that he carries without Willis, that Rickman is an actor with a future of memorable characters ahead of him, villainous and otherwise, (see him at his best in ROBIN HOOD PRINCE OF THIEVES.)Bruce was the one who initially suggested that John McClain have  a wife, and that she be played by Bonnie Bedelia. Smart move on Joel Silver's part that he took that advice, because as the damsel-in-distress, Bonnie comes across about as helpless as Bette Davis! The screen crackles with the chemistry between her and Willis as they argue like a husband and wife at odds, trying  to find their way back to common ground.

Willis' McClain is a wiseacre hard-ass with a smart-mouthed crack for even the diciest situation, (honed by his years on MOONLIGHTING), but unlike AH-nuld, he is no Superman, and even as we laugh at the Wiley Coyote scrapes he gets himself into, we wince simultaneously at every-near miss, be it flying bullets or free-falls through umpteen story windows, and cheer each time his pluck and determination to get the bad guys and save his missus, brings him through.John McTiernan, who made his career with this film, (and was deathly afraid of heights while shooting it!) doesn't waste a single opportunity given him by the script to turn all the action set pieces up to ELEVEN!

Besides Willis, British stage vet Alan Rickman oozed oily charm, unctuous ambition and tons of bad attitude as lead terrorist Hans Gruber, who matched Bruce for every thrust and parry in their scenes together, both physically and verbally. Best of all, it's easy to see in the scenes that he carries without Willis, that Rickman is an actor with a future of memorable characters ahead of him, villainous and otherwise, (see him at his best in ROBIN HOOD PRINCE OF THIEVES.)Bruce was the one who initially suggested that John McClain have  a wife, and that she be played by Bonnie Bedelia. Smart move on Joel Silver's part that he took that advice, because as the damsel-in-distress, Bonnie comes across about as helpless as Bette Davis! The screen crackles with the chemistry between her and Willis as they argue like a husband and wife at odds, trying  to find their way back to common ground.

And making matters all the more complicated, Riggs and Murtaugh each have personal issues of their own to deal with  Murtaugh with his daughter, Rianne (Traci Wolfe), and Riggs with Lorna Cole (Rene Russo), the first woman with whom he's had a long standing relationship since the death of his wife. \tWith three highly successful `Lethal' outings under their belts, it would have been easy for director Donner and his stars to phone this one in, make a few bucks and move on.

However, I think it's time to put to rest the notion of this being some kind of great film apart from its value as a keyhole onto to the Fabs' heyday. Let's face it, as pure moviemaking, this thing is a bit of a joke. The story, as such, is nonexistent, the pacing is flabby, and the Paul's grandfather subplot (which no one ever seems to mention in appraisals of the movie anymore, despite its taking up of a good deal of film time) is embarrassingly cheesy. On top of all that, the Beatles themselves are simply so hard to *understand* much of the time (Liverpool scouse being a very mumbled and slurred-together dialect) that quite a bit of the so-called sparkling wit just goes over (or under) your head the first three or four times you see it. Someone really should have sat the lads down with some Marx Brothers or Abbott and Costello movies to teach them at least the rudiments of enunciation and comic timing.As a story, it's very interesting how the film portrays the Beatles as prisoners of their own fame, with an unmistakable wisp of pathos and frustration which is allowed to undergird all the wildness and comedy. This especially comes through in the sequence where Ringo leaves the band to go parading and enjoy some freedom (an unconscious foreshadowing of future events to boot, as Ringo was the first Beatle to ever leave the band - four years later during the White Album sessions). Yet, the irony is never put forth that the very people who are keeping the Beatles prisoner - their fans - are the ones for whom this movie is made and is being aimed at. A decade later, such a disparity would have forced a punk band such as the Sex Pistols to fire off a massive F*** You! to its audience (and, in fact, one rock star did do just this - in film, no less Roger Waters during the amazing and squirm-inducing In the Flesh segment of Pink Floyd The Wall, where a concert of mindlessly adoring fans is compared none too subtly with a Nazi rally).I'm not saying, of course, that the Beatles should have come out spitting and gobbing at their fans and tearing apart their image in A Hard Day's Night. This would have been impossible to do in mainstream cinema in 1964, anyway. What I'm saying is that by introducing such a glaring irony and then failing to deal with it in any way, the film asserts itself solidly as a product of its times and nothing more - no great and enduring piece of art, certainly. In some ways, the next year's followup, Help!, was the better film because it did not try to be anything more than a madcap Beatle travelogue (and succeeded admirably, with its pristine color, beautiful locales, and clever comic moments - although its setups do get a bit monotonous after awhile).Of course, A Hard Day's Night *will* endure - simply because THE BEATLES endure, and this gives us the best sustained look at their performing prowess and all-around joie de vivre. The musical sequences in the film are simply glorious, particularly the orgiastic concert at the end, but even more muted moments such as when the Beatles sneak off to a nightclub to dance and intermingle with other youths to the soundtrack of their own songs; the scene provides a wonderful you are there quality to the partying and club-hopping side of Swinging London circa 1964. But a film's overall quality, I say, must be judged by its ability to be a complete and satisfying whole, not just as a vehicle to show off the talents and charm of its central figure or figures (otherwise, by that measure, Ace Ventura Pet Detective would have to be preserved and championed as one of America's greatest contributions to world cinema).So what am I saying, finally? A Hard Day's Night - if you are a Beatle fan it is essential; see it, enjoy it, revel in their youth and vitality as often and as passionately as you want. Just don't allow your enthusiasm for the group to confuse this with a great film.(btw If you wish to experience the group's charm and musical euphoria of this time full on, without the intrusions of a tacked on plot or supplementary characters, check out the wonderful documentary The Beatles' First U.S. Visit. Done by the Maysles brothers - the duo behind the Rolling Stones' Gimme Shelter later in the decade - the film captures all the excitement and footage of the Beatles' triumphant arrival in America, including all their Ed Sullivan appearances, various backstage reflections and shenanigans, and an extended, supercharged sequence of their concert at Washington Coliseum.

Instead of a slow buildup from banality to insanity - which, given the movie's otherwise brilliant creepiness of tone and style - could have been truly horrific to watch, we get Jack Torrance as the nutjob Big Bad Wolf right from the very beginning. It's weird it's as if Kubrick is indeed making the ultimate horror film, and Nicholson is sabotaging it every step of the way by enacting the ultimate horror film *parody*. Each on its own terms is immensely enjoyable, but they effectively cancel each other out. I've never seen the styles of director and star diverge so emphatically (A minor comparison would be the first Fletch movie, where Michael Ritchie's taut direction is appropriate to a gritty crime thriller, but where star Chevy Chase waltzes through the vehicle glibly throwing darts into every dramatic setup).However, there's no point in blaming Nicholson for the mess - this was clearly the way Kubrick wanted the part to be played. Perfectionist and control freak that he was, you don't believe for a minute that any inch of a Kubrick film isn't exactly how he wanted it; he certainly wouldn't allow a mere *actor* to steamroll his well-laid plans, not even one as forceful and magnetic as Jack Nicholson. Still, this movie - together with Batman, and even One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest - soured me on Jack for a long time; I found in him an actor far too willing to coast on his personality and to ham it up mercilessly, rather than bother to actually create a recognizable human being. Such a technique is fine, even commendable, for farceurs like Jim Carrey or Paul Reubens (either one of which would probably have been just as effective as Nicholson is here at being Jack Torrance) but we should expect more from our so-called Dramatic Actors. It wasn't until I saw some of his more restrained, nuanced work in such films as Ironweed, Wolf, The King of Marvin's Gardens, and even (amazingly) Easy Rider that I realized what a truly fine performer Nicholson can be when he is forced to, as it were, paint in between the lines (by the way, no complaints from me about his Oscar for As Good As It Gets - he's the only actor alive who could have made that part work the way it did). It's just too bad Kubrick didn't decide to use him this way; watching Jack Torrance go from a diffident, restrained man (watch the first part of Wolf to see how surprisingly well Nicholson can play such a character) to a rampaging lunatic would have been truly frightening (even with the extra bit of campiness Nicholson throws in - Heeere's Johnny!, etc). It would have been as if the Overlook Hotel unleashed some primordial demon from the depths of an essentially decent man. The way it plays now, Jack's evil and insanity are loudly telegraphed from the very beginning (those dancing eyebrows of his NEVER stop!) - all that's left is to go through the motions.Of course, there are some pretty startling motions to go through in this movie; Kubrick's technical brilliance and his ability to create an engrossing mise en scene ensure that the film can never be seen as a total failure. In fact, when Nicholson is offscreen, the goosebump factor here is actually pretty high. The long tracking shots of Danny riding his Big Wheel through the winding hotel corridors are justly famous, as is the very design of the Overlook's wide open - yet paradoxically oppressive - map room (where Jack does his writing) these sequences effectively make the Overlook into a character itself. The isolation of it, its stillness and quiet, and most importantly its labyrinthian hugeness serve to overwhelm the tiny family and break down whatever bond they may have (which, again, would have been so much more effective if we felt this family was ever bonded in the first place). Kubrick ingeniously avoids shock devices, for the most part, and creates his spooky atmosphere through an almost inhuman stillness and quiet - which effectively creates an undertow of dread and expectation in the viewer. Quite simply, there are images and flash-cuts in this movie that will get under your skin and that you will never be able to shake - they will haunt your subconscience forever (deliciously). None more so than the truly classic moment where Wendy, the wife, finally discovers what it is Jack has been writing all this time I can think of few movie moments in history that are so gut-bustingly hilarious and at one and the same time so bone-chillingly frightening and perverse. For this one moment alone, the film demands a viewing.It's simply too bad that Kubrick felt the need to invade the sanctity of his gothic cathedral like setting with the over the top rantings and ravings of the town lunatic. Not that that lunatic is not one devil of a fun guy to hiss and laugh at, it's just that he belongs in a different movie - the Evil Dead flicks, maybe, or one of Freddy Krueger's opuses. This conflict in styles between star and director ultimately make The Shining, for me at least, a frustrating experience I keep wishing one of them would just get out of the other's way. The Shining could have been one of the hammiest and most enjoyable grand guignol horror experiences ever, or it could have been perhaps the most finely crafted and subtly shaded psychological thriller of all time. Alas, it cannot be both - and in trying to do so, it effectively undermines itself at every turn.

Not that that lunatic is not one devil of a fun guy to hiss and laugh at, it's just that he belongs in a different movie - the Evil Dead flicks, maybe, or one of Freddy Krueger's opuses. This conflict in styles between star and director ultimately make The Shining, for me at least, a frustrating experience I keep wishing one of them would just get out of the other's way. The Shining could have been one of the hammiest and most enjoyable grand guignol horror experiences ever, or it could have been perhaps the most finely crafted and subtly shaded psychological thriller of all time. Alas, it cannot be both - and in trying to do so, it effectively undermines itself at every turn.

The fire is reflecting in Dougray's eyes and Tom has suck a slick and angry look on his face. It's one of those good guy and bad guy have an eye-to eye moment. The music playing on the part fits that moment perfectly. Everyone disagrees with me, but that is such an intense part in the film.

I loved the special effects and the music was so good. And as Thandie Newton put it, Beautifully orchestrated fight sequences. I thought the acting was so good. Dougray Scott played an awesome bad guy. Tom was much more aggressive. He also showed his amazing athletic ability. Thandie Newton was also great in this film. The places the movie was filmed at were beautiful. The action was so awesome. I haven't seen that much action in a film since Speed starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. One of my favorite parts in the movie is when Tom walks across a room surrounded with fire in slow motion. The fire is reflecting in Dougray's eyes and Tom has suck a slick and angry look on his face. It's one of those good guy and bad guy have an eye-to eye moment. The music playing on the part fits that moment perfectly. Everyone disagrees with me, but that is such an intense part in the film. I really enjoyed the rock climbing scene and the scene at the end when Dougray and Tom are fighting by hand and with no guns. In every scene there was action. The first one was boring and confusing, but MI-2 kept me entertained the whole time.

This film has comedy, drama, romance, but most of all, it has a very deep message, believe in yourself. The story was awesome, some characters were dramatic, such as Anabelle(brooke langton) and Shane(keanu reeves) and Jimmy (gene hackman) but sometimes at the same time the actors know how to give you a laugh, they dont overact, they make it just  perfect. keanu reeves is completely believable as Shane, so are the rest of the actors. the rest of the actors(replacement player) just made me laugh out loud. more films should be made that carry this kind of message, even though this one used violence it did it really well. my fav 2 scenes are where anabelle is in the bar with shane, and when shane says to anabelle  you give me strength. what a cutie!!!! really, its a must see!!!!!
