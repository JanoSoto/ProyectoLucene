She is a beautiful and quirky addition to the cast and she and Damon are comfortable and charismatic together (her character was based on Damon's then girlfriend who left him for Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich just before filming). The script is a taut psychological ballet, with some of the best monologues I've heard in a good long while (Damon's rant about hitting the hash pipe and joining the National Guard especially!)

One evening when Jack is feeling suicidal and has tied cinder blocks to his boots, two violent young guys with gasoline and matches attack him under a bridge.

A magical film, and despite it being made in 1989, still completely and maybe even more relevant to today's society. In a world of mass conformity, largely created by social media and smart phone technology, especially among the young and teenagers, it is ever more important to be inspired by and pursue what this film teaches us.

Passion for learning and excelling \/ expressing ourselves. Keeping your eyes open, looking backwards and forwards, never down. Life is not 1 dimensional. Life is about expression; expressing those many layers and dimensions which make up the fabric of life. This film completely encompasses that sentiment. Striving to find your own voice. Finding words and meanings to best depict the inner workings of your life and mind. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion.

Yet have we lost a sense of curiosity?

And that I had been spoiled by the recent space movies such as Gravity, Star Trek, or even Man of Steel. While technology has come a long way since 1995, I think Apollo 13 does hold up. And that is thanks to director Ron Howard and the entire cast of the film.When I say entire cast, I mean it. There are a number of great actors who were involved with the overall greatness that this movie was. Ed Harris is once again the bright spot of the film. He can do no wrong in any role, and Gene Kranz is one of his most iconic roles. This role even helped him get the speaking only part in Gravity. Hanks, Paxton, and Bacon formed a good trio inside the spaceship, though I would preferred Sinise. Sadly it does take awhile to get into space, a near 40 minutes before lift off. I understand you need to set up the emotional side with the family before capturing our heart strings in the final 15 minutes. But to do that you also need to have capable cast members as the family. Which in my opinion were the major weak spot. You don't really get to know the children at all, and Hank's wife doesn't do anything that we haven't seen out of worried family member. It just wasn't what ill remember this film for. I will remember it for showing the amount of hard work that hundreds and probably thousands of people had to do to save 3 people. It just shows you what a little teamwork can do.I thought the pacing was nice, especially for a 2hr 20 minute film. I also found it fascinating how many steps go into just one particular task while aboard a spaceship. Comparing it to one of my favorite films Gravity, there's a lot more going on. But Gravity's story is probably more remarkable because it was just one person. It isn't a true story like this one so when a miracle happens in the film, you know you're watching something that has actually happen. Where would I put this amongst the all-time space films?

Hamlet is Shakespeare's most complex and debated character, so Olivier condensing the movie isn't that bad. It also allows the movie more of a dark, Gothic feeling, much to Hamlet's self. But Olivier cutting out many lines, including all but the last line in the O what a rogue and peasant slave am I soliloquy arguably the best soliloquy in the play, is what I didn't like. It is the most intense we see him, and it is also when he shows his main traits sadness, anger, confusion, philosophy, wit, happiness and determination, all in the same part. It is also the play's turning point\/climax (all of Shakespeare's climax's happen near the middle). Olivier including that soliloquy would has added just a couple more minutes and would have made Olivier's great performance even better. Though I have been bickering at the condensation, that is not enough to say this movie wasn't good or sucked. What makes this so good is the filming and portrayals. Sir Laurence Olivier was the greatest actor of the 20th century. Some similar actors in his time such as Gielgud, Guinness and Richardson became his greatest rivals, but none could surpass him. But on film, Olivier did crappy performances by being completely unconvincing and very robotic. This is one of those times where he would deliver a superb powerhouse performance. Plus, the delivery of the character was very plausible. Hamlet is a character that only the best can play. To do a good Hamlet, one must have strong acting and accuracy. Not just one or the other, or one outweighing the other. There is no correct way of playing Hamlet, only accuracy. The only way to attain that accuracy is by showing every kind of human emotion, all while keeping a basis for the general character (Olivier's was a man who could not make up his mind, which is the most popular and plausible generalization). Olivier's accuracy may very well be how Shakespeare intended on writing Hamlet. His strong accuracy and dazzling performance makes this one of the best portrayals in film history. If you have not studied Hamlet, you won't think so. Other than Olivier, everyone else's portrayals and accuracy were spot on too. Even Gertrude (who was noticeably 10 years younger than Oliver) was great. Kenneth Branagh's 1996 version disgraced all characters except for Horatio. What makes this a great piece of film are the camera tricks and special effects. Although Olivier did not like doing movies, he admired filmmakers and wanted to do an artful movie. For a movie in the 1940s, the ghost, smokes, and lighting were uncanny. His capturing of a dark Gothic feeling is so good and fits the play very well. He also incorporates many camera tricks that adding meaning and pull the viewer in. This is the only artful and skillfully crafted film about a Shakespearean play.

The only way to attain that accuracy is by showing every kind of human emotion, all while keeping a basis for the general character (Olivier's was a man who could not make up his mind, which is the most popular and plausible generalization). Olivier's accuracy may very well be how Shakespeare intended on writing Hamlet. His strong accuracy and dazzling performance makes this one of the best portrayals in film history. If you have not studied Hamlet, you won't think so. Other than Olivier, everyone else's portrayals and accuracy were spot on too. Even Gertrude (who was noticeably 10 years younger than Oliver) was great. Kenneth Branagh's 1996 version disgraced all characters except for Horatio. What makes this a great piece of film are the camera tricks and special effects. Although Olivier did not like doing movies, he admired filmmakers and wanted to do an artful movie. For a movie in the 1940s, the ghost, smokes, and lighting were uncanny. His capturing of a dark Gothic feeling is so good and fits the play very well. He also incorporates many camera tricks that adding meaning and pull the viewer in. This is the only artful and skillfully crafted film about a Shakespearean play.

Yet, I fail to see greatness. In spite of the film's polished exterior, I couldn't help feeling that someone was pulling my leg. Several viewings have only expanded the list of problems I have with this film. These are only some of them. 1. Katherine Hepburn's acting, not her character. I thought Tracy was a very interesting character, complex and engaging. The fact that she was at the center of this film is what really redeems it in my opinion. In fact, it is such a vivid character that it finally manages to emerge through Hepburn's affected mannerisms, fake accent, and annoying high- pitched voice. It didn't make it better that everyone kept calling her pretty, something that I totally fail to comprehend. But that's just me of course. People have different tastes. (In all fairness to Hepburn, this theatrical, measured mode of delivery was apparently standard in that period; but she does take it to the extreme). 2. Cary Grant's character, not his acting. Grant radiates likability, and here he manages to give the best spin to what is practically an intolerable character a spoiled overgrown brat, whose only talents seem to be his looks and juvenile wisecracks. 3. Silly attitudes, nonsensical exchanges, and plain non sequiturs. Just some samples -Tracy's father blaming her for his own extramarital affairs. She was too distant, he says, so he had to find the filial affection he craves with women her age. I understand a man blaming his wife (which doesn't make it right of course), but his daughter! I mean, what could a man expect from his daughter that he can only find with some floozy in New York? -Dexter blaming Tracy for his drinking problems. His rationale she took that problem with him when she married him. -Speaking of which, how everybody kept reminding Tracy of her high and mighty attitude, and how she has no sympathy for human imperfection (without showing any real examples of this). I do not necessarily disagree. But they just kept hammering the message until you could see a mile away that Tracy will surely get her comeuppance&#x97;discovering her own weakness and learning something valuable in the process. -Tracy's reaction when Macaulay tells her that nothing serious happened between them last night Why? Was I so unattractive, and this is in the presence of her fiancé, the man to whom she's trying to prove her innocence. It doesn't get sillier than that. -Tracy blaming Kittredge for, I don't know exactly, maybe not trusting her enough. The man saw his bride-to-be drunk in the arms of another man, who then proceeded to take her to the bedroom upstairs. Even she was surprised to know they hadn't slept together. And he didn't judge her as she claims. He wrote her a note asking for an explanation. Sounds quite reasonable to me. 4. On the last point, how Kittredge was made out to be the villain\/laughing stock of the piece. After he left, even Macaulay and Liz were practically celebrating. This is one of the cases where the author is trying to pull the viewer in one direction, but the viewer (at least my humble self) does not quite see eye to eye. Kittredge struck me generally as a decent guy. He obviously loved Tracy and was willing to put up with her whims. His only fault, it seems, was that he was a self- made man, unlike the vacuous rich boy Dexter. I couldn't help feeling that Philip Barry, the author of the play on which the film is based, was overcome by his aristocratic sensibilities in dividing good guys and bad buys along class lines. Whatever the case may be, well-crafted plot and sleek dialogue do little to reduce the inescapable sense of artificiality and forced character development. One could say, of course, that such devices were typical of the time period. Especially in the early talkies, movie makers were so eager to capitalize on the new medium that dialogue (as witty and polished as possible) became the foundation of the film. Philadelphia Story, then, is a product of its time, and you can't blame it for that. But this means also that is dated in a way that truly great films are not. Overall a likable innocent farce, but, in my opinion, not the timeless masterpiece it is made out to be.

The last time I watched an excellent crime film that didn't take itself seriously it was Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece Pulp Fiction. Whilst not as good as it, Guy Ritchie's Snatch is definitely a brilliant film. Pulp Fiction was outstanding, and revolusionary when compared to other 'gangster' flicks. The biggest change was the introduction of the mobius strip-style plot line, where the concept of time is no longer linear, instead constantly folding in upon itself, flitting between past, present and future that forces the viewer to pay close attention lest they miss some subtle detail. Inevitably, numerous copycat films emerged that tried to capitalize on Tarantino's success, but it wasn't until 1998 when Guy Ritchie, an unknown British director, took on the challenge and directed Lock Stock and Two Smoking barrels, to critical aclaim. I haven't seen Lock Stock, but after watching Snatch I am really looking forward to it.The story revolves around some boxing promoters, a Russian gangster, dopy amateur robbers, a 'Jewish' jewler, and pretty violent bookmakers all in pursuit of a stolen diamond.

(and where'd that remote control come from? , LOL) You'll enjoy this film whether you rent it, buy it or stream it.Tim Meadows is an underrated, underused talent, especially considering his long tenure on Saturday Night Live. This film only received modest returns at the box office, but it is definitely worth checking out.

As part of a crime movie marathon I was going through (which included Casino, The Godfather, and Goodfellas) this was definitely the worst of the night. Confused by its' high ratings, I searched around on the internet trying to find out what was so good about it. I mean, certain films don't suit certain people, but I was sure I knew a good crime flick when I saw one. Then I discovered my mistake. What I expected was a fact-based account of the dealings and on-goings of Al Capone, and the men who ended up stopping him. I wanted to be submerged in the 1920's life of suits, hats and tommy guns. What I instead watched was a movie that overglorified one 'untouchable' and focused only on his life and on-goings. There was corniness all over and cheesy characters. I only really liked two parts the opening credits, and the baseball bat scene. There were only a few clips of Al Capone, and in those rare moments it seemed as though I was watching a different movie.Turns out, it doesn't help finding out a bit about a movie before you watch it. What 'The Untouchables' actually is, is a fictional and classy noir-style film. Plus, it is titled 'The Untouchables' and not 'Al Capone', and there were high review of the movie all around. Because of this, I decided to give it another chance.My second viewing was far more enjoyable than the first. Now appreciating it for what it was, most of the cheese had turned into style. Ennio Morricone's score really captures the noir-style feel of the film. The performances are great, especially Robert De Niro as Capone. When I first discovered that he played the part, I was in chuckles. Not because I didn't think he could do it, but because I thought that the role choice was strange. But my, how much range thins man has got! De Niro really makes the cahacter his own, giving Capone a fierceness that is nesseccary so that he becomes a solid character in the few scenes that he is in. The plot is pretty much told side by side from Eliot Ness' story with Al Capone's, until they both clash in court.I appriciated a lot of scenes more the second time, too. The pram scene, court scene, and the death of Jim Malone all stood out, among every part with Robert De Niro. Its not a perfect film, however, especially when it comes to classic 80's cheese. For example, the ambush on the bridge was accompanied by, in my opinion, inappropriate music. 'Strength of the righteous' took out any tension that was built up prior to the attack.

It's a crazy and unique ride that is a total classic, for good reason. Raising Arizona has a lot of great and funny performances, the highlight being Nicolas Cage. His crazy and unpredictable nature works well here, and you can't help but laugh at his antics. Holly Hunter also does a great job as his wife, who has some pretty good laugh out loud moments. John Goodman also has a role among some other recognizable faces that all come together really well.The humour is the biggest strength in this film, because it will really have you laughing out loud. There's lots of really witty and well thought out jokes, including some slap stick humour which works wonderfully. One stand out comedic scene is when Nicolas Cage decides he needs to get some Huggies for the baby, and he resorts to his criminal ways to do so, leading to a really funny chase scene that keeps you laughing throughout.

Cocky young caddy at the Bushwood Country Club gets in with the nouveau riche swells in hopes of gaining a college scholarship, but soon rebels against the blowhard boors once he's invited to participate in a winners-take-all team golf match. The main narrative, littered with useless supporting characters and a few naked babes, is so thin (and derivative besides, mostly from TV shows such as Saturday Night Live) that it has to rely on a troublesome animatronic gopher to raise audience good will. Debuting director Harold Ramis (who also worked on the screenplay) doesn't have the snappy timing of, say, a John Landis (even as he hopes to ape Animal House and its ilk). The movie feels cramped and cheap, with pothead-slow pacing and various episodes that aren't shaped and don't fit together. Since humor is entirely personal--what one viewer groans at may make hundreds of others roar with laughter--there's nothing left to respond to except the merits of the production (which is sloppy) and the comedians who make up most of the cast. Chevy Chase, Bill Murray (as an unhinged groundskeeper), Ted Knight and Rodney Dangerfield are each disappointing; relying on shtick and blobby improvisation, they're just winging it. Chase, in particular, seems super-imposed on the action through some technological shortcut; he's smug, not self-assured, and has all the personality of a man acting in front of a mirror. As the randy caddy, Michael O'Keefe must have relished this comedic opportunity to lighten up from his role as Robert Duvall's son in 1979's The Great Santini; his callow youthfulness, messy crop of blonde hair and deadpan sanity help him stand out from his hammy elders, but he's like Tim Matheson in Animal House the decent kid on the make, eager to be corrupted. We're supposed to cheer his corruption and take delight in the sight of the rube sticking it to the man, while Murray plants and sets off explosives during the golf match and nobody takes notice of him.

They can happen even if you are in the safety of your home and since the rules of reality do not apply to them, they can take any turn. And since they are in your own head, there is no escape. What can be worse than such a nightmare coming true? This movie adopts this premise literally. A group of parents murder a serial child killer, Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund). He exerts revenge on them by haunting their children in their dreams. What these kids experience in their dreams is parallely happening to them in reality...Freddy Krueger is an iconic villain today and he has spawned numerous sequels and cross-overs, all for good reason. He has a plausible back- story which is frightening even in real life. His mode of operation in unique. His weapon is a clawed glove, simple yet so scary. He steals the show and possibly even the audience's night-time visions with a mere seven minutes of screen time. The film does not rely much on jump scares though there are a few. It creates a tension-heavy atmosphere and plays more on psychological fear. The narrative is simple and coherent. For those who want to see gore, there is some of that too. The film suffers from two major drawbacks. First, most of the acting is hammy especially by Langenkamp. But, this could be due to the fact that it is a slasher film, a genre not well-respected and it is of low budget. They could probably not afford the right kind of actors, though they roped in the then unknown Johnny Depp. Second, the ending looks like a cheap trick to exact one last scare from us and\/or pave way for a sequel. I read that the director, Wes Craven wanted to have a different ending and was persuaded to alter it by the producer, Shaye. Craven's idea sounds much better and he should have stuck to that. A memorable film none-the-less.

They can happen even if you are in the safety of your home and since the rules of reality do not apply to them, they can take any turn. And since they are in your own head, there is no escape. What can be worse than such a nightmare coming true? This movie adopts this premise literally. A group of parents murder a serial child killer, Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund). He exerts revenge on them by haunting their children in their dreams. What these kids experience in their dreams is parallely happening to them in reality...Freddy Krueger is an iconic villain today and he has spawned numerous sequels and cross-overs, all for good reason. He has a plausible back- story which is frightening even in real life. His mode of operation in unique. His weapon is a clawed glove, simple yet so scary. He steals the show and possibly even the audience's night-time visions with a mere seven minutes of screen time. The film does not rely much on jump scares though there are a few. It creates a tension-heavy atmosphere and plays more on psychological fear. The narrative is simple and coherent. For those who want to see gore, there is some of that too. The film suffers from two major drawbacks. First, most of the acting is hammy especially by Langenkamp. But, this could be due to the fact that it is a slasher film, a genre not well-respected and it is of low budget. They could probably not afford the right kind of actors, though they roped in the then unknown Johnny Depp. Second, the ending looks like a cheap trick to exact one last scare from us and\/or pave way for a sequel.

Goes to show what an impression the film made the first time around. The time travel concept here is treated very loosely, because if you think about it, there are a lot of inconsistencies in the story. I think the first movies dealing with the idea used one of the themes here that says the same person could not meet up with him or herself in another era because it would cause themselves to self destruct. Matter\/anti-matter, something along those lines, but then you have more current films like Looper that throw that whole idea out the window.Well I guess you're not supposed to think too deeply about those kinds of things with film entertainment. Even if that's the case, I'm pretty sure the phrase 'Sh-t happens would not have been used by Wall Street traders in 1929. Or have the house that just blew up twice in the same picture wind up good as new at the end of the story. Aside from that - what about that knife fight between Walker (Van Damme) and the Japanese guy in the kitchen? - who in their right mind would stick to sword fight principles instead of just trying to stick it to the other guy?Other reviewers on this board bring up a whole bunch of other goofy and implausible instances found in the movie so no sense trying to engage them all in my little effort here. Suffice it to say that what you have here is a neat little diversion for a little over an hour and a half that's entertaining enough if you don't get too wrapped up and try to make any sense out of it. All those questions will be answered some day when we have time travel for real.
