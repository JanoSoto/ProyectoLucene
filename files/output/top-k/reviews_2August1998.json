The prevailing comments among nay-sayers is that the characters were too stereo-typical, and that a plot of one man being important enough to risk the lives of 8 was unbelievable.

How could you represent every man that ever fought in this, and other, wars without being stereotypical?  Unless, of course you wanted to have a cast of several million people.  The point was to show the trevails that every man went through in the war, NOT to give a unique face to each. And it seems he did this with his usual mastery.Second, the plot.  The mistake that most are making is that they're thinking of Private Ryan as one man.  He wasn't.  He was everyone.  Every person that was sitting in that theater.  Every person that has ever been a part of this country.     When he tells Ryan to Earn this, he is talking to YOU. He is saying that we're not here today by accident.

He is telling you not to waste the precious life you've been given.   So, yes, this is perhaps the greatest movie of all time, shaky camera or not.

First, the comment that the character  development was good could not possibly be farther from the truth. The  reason for this, of course, is the desire to put as much of Chris Rock's  stand-up routine, Riggs' and Murtough's infantile antics, Pesci's comic  relief, and a whole lot of things blowing up into the film. Rock is not an  actor, and his character was completely unnecessary and as one-dimensional  as they come. He served no real purpose in the film except to get a few  cheap laughs from his supposed homosexual attraction to Murtough. This  plotline, along with the entire scene in the dentist's office, have been  done hundreds of times in sitcoms, and with much better and funnier  results. It was also amazing how Jet Li, playing the role of cyborg robot  killer, was actually the most human character in the entire movie. He  actually showed some genuine emotion, although nothing more than furious  rage. The script (if in fact there was one) was also severely lacking. Plot  details were thrown in like an afterthought in between explosions. The  action scenes were extremely elaborate, but at the same time boring since  they, in almost every instance, had nothing to do with anything that had  transpired previously. If this movie is what you're looking for, save  yourself some money by watching the Chris Rock Show and a Fox special.  This was an awful movie in a summer of awful movies, and I have lost  respect for everyone who appeared in this fiasco for their association.  Here's hoping that Chris Rock and Danny Glover's film careers are over,  and Gibson, Russo, and Pesci distance themselves from this tanking franchise.

For instance, the killers (I won't reveal them here) end up being extremely minor and undeveloped characters whom the audience has not suspected at all in the first place.  In a good whodunit, the person watching should at first suspect the killer, and then be manipulated into dismissing this thought as too obvious.  The person should then flail about wildly suspecting everyone until the real killer is revealed, completely shocking them.  Instead, Scream 2 simply sells itself with more gore and throws in the most predictable killer.  For the killer's partner, Scream 2 chooses to nearly introduce an entirely new character.  Now, how is the audience supposed to suspect, be nervous about, and therefore terrified of a character they do not know in the first place?
