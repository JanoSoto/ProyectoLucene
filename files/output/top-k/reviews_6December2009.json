This is nastier, louder, dumber and every other time they thought they had a punchline, they repeated it excessively. The Klumps have one-note personalities, and the fact that their flat and stereotypical characters in no way have enough dimensions to be the focus of an entire feature is evident in the fact that this is also about Sherman, whose job and relationship with the attractive female lead is threatened by the actions of Buddy, whom he cannot control. Wait... that's the plot of the original! Well, Pinkett-Smith was smart and did not reprise her role(I'd personally like to think that she channeled her hubby and answered the makers of this mess with a big ol' heartfelt aw, hell no!), so they got Janet Jackson and her breasts instead, and writing Jada off with a single explanatory line. Plus, Mr. Love gets a body of his own, and... get this... he behaves in a dog-like manner! Isn't that hilarious? No, it isn't, but it's about as good as it gets here. Common sense goes out the window to make way for more jokes and gags. The effects are better, though they push them way too far. There are no genuine laughs to be found here. The ethical ramifications are mentioned and not explored. Production is standard. Even if you liked the 1996 flick, you probably won't enjoy this; go ahead and ask people who have watched both. There is crude and sexual material in this.

This story is about a frat named Delta House Fraternity, the last frat left on the campus as the whole frat is shifted in society. The time is 1962 AD, hence it is clear that Human has developed a lot and devastated the campus completely. John Belushi remains in the frat house and cleans up all the junk, feeling lonely in the whole campus.Too many big names associated with this project. Apart from the mammoth star-cast, please pay attention to the three intellectual pool of writers contributing to the ahem... broth. The answer lies somewhere in between Brainstorming exercise gone haywire or paradigm shift went overboard.The last 15-minutes takes a complete mickey out of the audience. Whoever came up with it let me assure you it was a monkeys idea. The only part which deserved better writing was the way the lead characters meet and start to like each other which I would safely say is a minor aberration which can be ignored.Animal House is a remake of Malayalam movie which was sequel to Hera Pheri. As usual John Landis and his team customised the recipe to suit the palette. Needless to say, moving the story-base to the Americas, capturing the English summer and yet not losing sight of the plot has translated into a decent show. And for those who are crying foul, never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was legal... then.

Herzog repeated unprofessional actor Bruno S. again after their appreciable teaming in 'Kasper Hauser' and teamwork again proves another landmark film. Bruno is again social outsider here like 'Kasper Hauser'. In initial scene we come to witness his releasing from prison. He loves just two things in life- playing musical instruments and drinking beer. But soon he realized that life in Germany is full of hardships and brutal one, so along with his prostitute girlfriend Eva and an old neighbor they thought about starting new life in America-the land of opportunities. For them America is an unexplored mystery or a dream of freedom. But soon disillusionment starts unsettling them in hostile land and they realized that life is severe and brutal everywhere and perhaps it's more severe wasteland in America. Remembering the great visionary American poet T S Elliot his 'The waste land' here. Bruno and Eva are physically safe in America and there is no local hoodlum who's kicking them in their hometown but still Bruno is so unhappy. As Bruno explains to Eva in one of the scene that in Germany it was visible but here they do it so gentle way, and that's much worse than it seems. That invisible chaos seems economical on surface but it's deeper at mental & spiritual level. Only Bruno understands it and that's lead us to that brutally dark ending part.I've never seen final ten minutes in any movies as symbolically represented chaos of life in this one. It is just a phenomenon. Those dancing\/ piano playing birds, a shot in ropeway and circularly moving trolley will remain permanently imprinted to my senses. I became bit sleepy while watching it yesterday and miss the brilliant clue by Herzog in that final scene. I watch that scene again today prior to writing this post and it was Eureka moment. It is that line written on the backside of that ropeway vehicle in which Bruno sat last. IS IT REALLY ME! The clue signifies the futility of both driverless revolving trolley and trained performing birds. But for Bruno life itself is futile and he knew it damn well. That final scene was just something that you get from auteur like Herzog only!Salute to this genius filmmaker.

Allen is 42 year old Issac, a divorced television writer dating high schooler Tracy (Mariel Hemingway). Decrying the cool medium for it's lack of creativity he quits in frustration and regrets it immediately. His ex (Meryl Streep) further humiliates him by writing a tell all. He then becomes involved with friend Yale's (Michael Murphy) more age appropriate former mistress Mary(Diane Keaton). Breaking off his relationship with Tracy he gets more deeply involved with Mary but all doesn't go smooth.Manhattan's storyline moves along at a breezy pace with Allen's dialog more tempered towards light comedy with dramatic undertones than his usual screwball approach. Keaton's Mary is less zany and more down to earth than her clownish Annie Hall character and Issac's intellectual equal from the outset. His sexual\/intellectual prodigy relationship with Tracy is conveniently rationalized as Mariel Hemingway says little (I go to high school)but remains touchingly effective. Allen's debatable exploitation of a minor is softened by Issac who displays more paternalism than lust for Tracy even though he must give unto Moliere in the film's final minutes. The real star of the picture though remains the title character. Breathing life and romance into the story Allen makes Manhattan a movable feast of busy scenes and ambiance. East Side, West Side, up, down or mid town Allen's backdrop carried along by strains of Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue and Gordon Willis' impressive cinematography celebrates a city in all its glory elevating the hum drum, common existence of the players by infusing them with its energy. At times its dominance threatens to overwhelm the story and its self absorbed petty intellectuals but Allen wisely refrains from signature slapstick to pad roles and disrupt the film's sentimental melancholia for the sake of balance. Less strident and more somber than his previous comedy efforts Manhattan shows a maturity and sophistication that would inform his best work throughout the 80s.
