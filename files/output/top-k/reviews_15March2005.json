But, it was Robin Hood, and had Christian Slater, so I watched it. I was absolutely right on every count. The film was, in nearly equal parts, violent, sexual, disgusting and Costner centrifugal. What I hadn't counted on was that, somehow, it would be in a good way, and work alarmingly well. The film is funny, action packed, touching, romantic, and did I mention, unexpectedly funny? Performances range from good to flawless, and there really are no small parts, or small actors. Some high points Wulf. Rarely talks, but the kid is wonder, with dead aim and a killer smile. Friar Tuck. Obviously, comic relief, but you have to admire this man- he would have been so easy to write as an overly pious coward, instead he is kind hearted, funny, and never, ever gives up. The Sheriff. Well, it's Alan Rickman, was anyone expecting less than excellence? He is amusing, and you almost (Almost, not quite, mind you) feel sorry for him when he (Gasp) is not the final triumphant victor. Will. Always my favorite character in any Robin Hood story, Will Scarlett rocks so hard you can barely see straight. Cast Christian Slater in the role and add good costume and a couple of plot twists that'll throw your head off, and I have to wonder how it can get better. Of course it does, when his first entrance involves singing a lovely little thief song to the not-so-authentic tune of 'Pop goes the Weasel'. On top of everything, Prince of Thieves has a mind numbingly beautiful soundtrack, and the extended edition has a very nice music video. All in all, a very good movie that should be seen at least once by anyone with a queasy-resistant stomach. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 March 2005","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Okay, so I had some big doubts about this film, expecting it to be too violent, too sexual, too disgusting and too focused around Kevin Costner.

Aaron Stanford is quite good as the lead character. He nicely captures Oscar's apparent innocence mixed with strong desire for older women. Whereas Sigourney Weaver is surprisingly flat and unimpressive as the stepmother. Perhaps she was not a good choice for the role too. I would have preferred Meg Ryan. However, Bebe Neuwirth is brilliant as her friend Diane who has a sexual interest on Oscar. She is fluent, natural and funny. John Ritter also gives a good performance as his father.The film is a low-budget one, shot in about two weeks. And it doesn't get out of that setback. The screenplay is poor. The idea of quoting Voltaire from time to time is disturbing.

The tale begins with Flora, an orphan removed from her home in a convent in Europe, who is told that she is being taken to the Americas to become the ward of one Mrs. Allworthy, who is credited to have been the woman her mother served. Mrs. Allworthy's manservant and confidant, Hibble, is the one who is to both bear her to his employer, and also to read to Flora the diary of her mother, Moll Flanders, to explain her life to her.Robin Wright shines as the lost and ever soul-searching innocent Moll Flanders, who despite making many wrong choices in life seems to find her way to kind places again and again. Her unconditionally loving future husband, credited The Artist on screen but listed as John Fielding on this site, is played by John Lynch. Stockard Channing is Mrs. Allworthy, who we come to discover is the owner of a Bordello and is a manipulative woman who can sway any man into her power. Lastly, Morgan Freeman plays the part of gentle and world-wisened Hibble, and I think this is one of his best roles, as he interacts so swimmingly with Robin on camera.The movie is rated PG-13 for sexual situations, nudity and some violence. Despite the subject matter, the film charms the soul. I recommend lovers of Gothic literature to read it, and for people who love the book to give this story a chance as a separate entity.

This is just so unbelievably bad that i can't understand what happened really. There might not have been premises for a classic here, but at least they should have been able to make it a tolerable movie.This is the touching story of stripper slash prostitute Nomi Malone (Elizabeth Berkley) who comes to Las Vegas seeking fame and fortune. She starts out dancing at a seedy joint, but through luck and some dirty moves she gets the opportunity to become a real showgirl! Soon though it becomes apparent that life as a showgirl is not as glamorous as Nomi had hoped...This movie sets the tone right from the beginning. From the inbred retard that Nomi hitches a ride with to Vegas, to her completely unwarranted emotional outbreaks this is a ride into the mouth of madness. I can only guess what script-writer Joe Eszterhas and director Paul Verhoeven were thinking, but i'm not sure i WANT to guess. Because like someone pointed out, this is most likely a movie based on Joe Eszterhas highly secret list that he keeps under his pillow 100 things i would do if i was a woman for a day. And most of those things involve touching, displaying, fondling, talking about and otherwise handling breasts.Acting here is non-existent. Elizabeth Berkley makes a career-crashing performance in the lead, making her character into an emotional train-wreck lashing out at the most unexpected times. Gina Gershon is suitably sleazy as Cristal Connors, the queen of showgirls. Kyle MacLachlan should receive an award for strangest hairdo, but also deserves notice for his complete inability to act casual. It feels to me that even though director Verhoeven seemed to be completely oblivious as to how deep this movie was plunging, maybe the actors had some idea. Most of them are just plain awful, even actors that are usually at least acceptable. And why should they try? Lifting the paycheck, going home and hope nobody watches the movie was probably all they could do. The truth is that it would be easy to go on for literally days listing all the flaws in this movie. But there is no real point. This is a movie that has to be experienced. One of those marathons of crap that are so bad they turn into instant classics. So while the quality is on zero kelvin levels, the entertainment value is rather high. I would however recommend high levels of alcohol for this to be truly enjoyable.

Not only are the performances excellent (particularly those of Tracy and Hepburn), but also the social issues are addressed with enough emotion to make the topics still relevant more than 30 years later. For all it's preaching and awkward dancing (somebody please shoot that delivery boy), the film comes off as an ably directed film that is both a crowd-pleaser and a work of art.But everyone knows that. I won't talk more about the easy praise for the movie. Instead I think there exists some interesting underlying racism typical of Hollywood at this time First off, John Prentice freely gives all of his power up to Joanna's parents when he lets them decide on accepting him or not.

Night Shyamalan and immensely enjoyed his other three films. However, I feel that all the things which were great about The Sixth Sense, The Village, and Unbreakable are contrasted by the disappointing and predictable Signs. This film would be considered a dud for an ordinary director, but I am especially disappointed since it was made by a higher caliber of filmmaker in M. Night Shyamalan. Almost all of the elements that make his other films great are missing from Signs. To me, this movie seems like a cheap imitation of Shyamalan's other three films. There is a small number of redeeming factors which I will get to first, however they are few and far between. First of, as in all of his other films Shyamalan does a great job of directing. I really enjoy the way he uses the camera and the abstract angles at which he prefers to shoot some of his scenes. The only other aspect of this movie that I liked was Mel Gibson's performance. There are only a handful of other actors that can bring so much humility and sincerity to a character. Gibson truly is a superb actor and his performance is absolutely top notch. The compliments, however, pretty much end here.One of the most disappointing things about this film is that the plot simply doesn't hold water (no pun intended for those who've seen it). You watch it for two hours and at the end you're left wondering what truly was the point. Shyamalan attempts to convey a message of belief, or the loss of, in God and in other things that human beings have been debating over for thousands of years. Yet it's hard to take away any kind of serious message when you're looking at some alien that belongs in a corny 1950's horror film. Simply put, this message along with the film both miss the mark completely. Unlike the other three Shyamalan films, Signs left me completely devoid of any true feelings or thoughts. I think that Stuart Litte (which was written by M. Night) had a more profound message than did Signs. What is most disappointing is that like them or not, Shyamalan's other films at least made you think. Signs, on the other hand, only made me wonder what it was that Shyamalan was thinking when he made this film.

The movie is almost flawless both technically and artistically. Empire has the mythological fairy tale adventure qualities of the original Star Wars but is much darker and faster paced than its predecessor.There are many characteristics that distinguish Empire from the other films. The first has to be the use of the Imperial March theme. The entire film's tone and pace is set because of this theme, which is played before almost every scene featuring Darth Vader. This theme is much more menacing than the four note melody played before Death Star scenes throughout Star Wars.The other unique quality of the film is that there are two parallel stories throughout the film. How many movies are there with two major story lines happening at the same time? The movie is very successful as it goes back and forth between Luke's Jedi training with Master Yoda and Darth Vader's pursuit of the Millennium Falcon. There is nothing choppy about the transitions between the two plots.Frank Oz's performance as Yoda is fabulous and Mark Hamill gives his best performance of the series in this movie. He makes Yoda believable and because of this, you never get the impression that Luke is being trained by one of the Muppets.The scene on Daghobah that really shows the film's artistic merits is the scene where Luke goes into the cave. It is here that Luke discovers he has a dark side in him and must be careful to avoid the dark side's temptations.The blossoming romance between Han and Leia is another highlight. It's fun to see their love hate relationship. This is screwball comedy at its finest. Who can forget the carbon freezing scene in which Leia and Han utter their famous I love you, I know lines? The addition of Lando Calrissean is also part of what makes Empire great. It is when he enters that everyone in the movie changes their pronunciation of Han's first name. I've always found this amusing and wonder if the director Irvin Kershner noticed.I could go on and on about how amazing this movie is. Darth Vader rules in this movie. All of his Imperial officers live in fear hoping they don't get choked with Vader's use of the force. The cinematography is gorgeous in this movie (Bespin is THE best looking planet in the Star Wars galaxy). And who can forget Darth Vader's revelation to Luke after their dramatic lightsaber duel? I find it hard to believe this movie was not only not nominated for Best Picture, director, or actor (which it should have been) but it also didn't make the AFI's best 100 films list. This movie is the fan and critics favorite and is one of the greatest movies ever made. It's a far superior movie to many Best Picture winners including Titanic and Forrest Gump. This movie is a masterpiece and in my opinion one of the best movies ever made.May the force be with it.

Empire has the mythological fairy tale adventure qualities of the original Star Wars but is much darker and faster paced than its predecessor.There are many characteristics that distinguish Empire from the other films. The first has to be the use of the Imperial March theme. The entire film's tone and pace is set because of this theme, which is played before almost every scene featuring Darth Vader. This theme is much more menacing than the four note melody played before Death Star scenes throughout Star Wars.The other unique quality of the film is that there are two parallel stories throughout the film. How many movies are there with two major story lines happening at the same time? The movie is very successful as it goes back and forth between Luke's Jedi training with Master Yoda and Darth Vader's pursuit of the Millennium Falcon. There is nothing choppy about the transitions between the two plots.Frank Oz's performance as Yoda is fabulous and Mark Hamill gives his best performance of the series in this movie. He makes Yoda believable and because of this, you never get the impression that Luke is being trained by one of the Muppets.The scene on Daghobah that really shows the film's artistic merits is the scene where Luke goes into the cave. It is here that Luke discovers he has a dark side in him and must be careful to avoid the dark side's temptations.The blossoming romance between Han and Leia is another highlight. It's fun to see their love hate relationship. This is screwball comedy at its finest. Who can forget the carbon freezing scene in which Leia and Han utter their famous I love you, I know lines? The addition of Lando Calrissean is also part of what makes Empire great. It is when he enters that everyone in the movie changes their pronunciation of Han's first name. I've always found this amusing and wonder if the director Irvin Kershner noticed.I could go on and on about how amazing this movie is. Darth Vader rules in this movie. All of his Imperial officers live in fear hoping they don't get choked with Vader's use of the force. The cinematography is gorgeous in this movie (Bespin is THE best looking planet in the Star Wars galaxy). And who can forget Darth Vader's revelation to Luke after their dramatic lightsaber duel? I find it hard to believe this movie was not only not nominated for Best Picture, director, or actor (which it should have been) but it also didn't make the AFI's best 100 films list. This movie is the fan and critics favorite and is one of the greatest movies ever made. It's a far superior movie to many Best Picture winners including Titanic and Forrest Gump. This movie is a masterpiece and in my opinion one of the best movies ever made.May the force be with it.

If only David Fincher would make a real directors cut and the effects were improved a bit, mainly with the matte lines around the alien in some scenes, I think I would give it a 10. But either way i still enjoy it a lot and sometimes i have felt like watching this movie over aliens, depending on how I'm feeling at the time.

The character of Homer as sort of a reverse Peter Pan (a grown man in a child's body) was simply annoying and I kept hoping for a chainsaw to cut his head off. I don't know how the rest of clan put up with him. Also, if Jesse and company has been doing this for 120+ years, why hasn't somebody caught on by now? That's a lot of dead bodies and burning buildings\/vehicles. Nobody else has ever stop them but Caleb takes care of it in one night.The scenery is wrong. The movie takes place in Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. I've lived there. Where in the world did all the mountains come from? They could of changed the story to Arizona and New Mexico and it would have fit perfectly.Finally I had a complaint with the transfusions curing a person of vampirism. To become a vampire, a vampire bites you and drinks your blood. Yet, to stay a vampire, you must continue to consume blood; from vampires (as Caleb does with Mae) or non-vampires.

This is the sort of film that people will go into with zero expectations because of the brilliance of the original and dislike it because of the huge chasm of quality between this and Tourneur's film. However, in spite of the fact that this remake isn't nearly as good; it still stands alone as a more than decent eighties horror flick. The thick and foreboding atmosphere of the original has been replaced by a more sleazy, erotic tone and the film is much more keen to focus on themes of lust and incest than the folklore behind the affliction of the central character, which the original portrayed so well. This offers a different take on the 'Cat People' theme, and while it never works as well as the tone in the original; it's still rather nice, and on a personal note; I just love sleazy films! Not to mention the fact that a frame for frame remake is never a good idea.The film features a number of corny moments, and the gore and nudity go over the top on several occasions, which won't go down well with many fans of the original, but it isn't a bad thing, as all these things add to the kitschy element of the film and all aid the sleaze, and are, therefore, more than welcome in my opinion. The theme of incest is capitalised upon, and director Paul Schrader doesn't seem all that bothered about making a film that crosses a boundary where taboos are concerned. Malcolm McDowell aids this film massively in this respect, and his performance in this movie is nothing short of fabulous. He's simultaneously malevolent and perverse, and every moment he's on screen is a highlight. The original worked by way of keeping the action simple, and ensuring the audience is always left guessing as to what's going to happen next. Schrader goes the other way with this movie, and he makes sure that we see EVERYTHING, and this is no bad thing in my book. The mystery is retained still, and Schrader manages to leave us on the edge of our seats.When it comes to movies featuring shape shifting, it's nearly always, if not always, werewolves that are the central focus; so another thing I like about this film is that it offers a different animal for the characters to change into. It has no doubt taken influence from 'The Howling', with it's great little change sequence towards the end, and that marks one of the highlights of the movie. The movie is a little overlong, and the ending will leave many (including yours truly) cold, but on the whole, while this is disappointing because it's not as great as the original, it's still a damn fine horror film.

Of course, this effort seriously dates the movie (I also smile at the rather whimsical, seat-of-the-pants, outsider endeavors of our heroes as they manfully put forth, launching their rocket one-step ahead of the narrow-minded authorities.

X-M's b&w budget (special effects courtesy of U.S. Army White Sands V-2 stock footage and miniatures of the string and cardboard variety) the producers made a last-minute choice to not throw a lot of science at us and to take us deeper into space than the moon. What they had going for them were some excellent character actors doing star-turns for a change of career-pace, a script by Dalton Trumbo, music by Ferde Grofe, and excellent -- and evocative -- sound and camera work...etc.The film's overall messages are simplistic -- nuclear war is bad and should be avoided and the human spirit for exploration and discovery cannot be put down by failure and difficulty (I guess they never considered budget shortfalls as a failure of spirit). These ideas are, at least, given voice here during what was, after all, a dangerous era in American politics. Remember, Dalton Trumbo was blacklisted! The science? Okay, it sucks. Who cares!?
