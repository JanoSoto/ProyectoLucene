The earlier scenes of the movie - before the men ventured out on their search for gold - actually impressed me more than the main parts of the film did.

Paranoia and greed is one thing, but it just didn't sit right with me for this character of Dobbs - especially after we'd seen what a fair guy he is back when he only took his share of the salary instead of grabbing the whole wad of bills from his beaten employer (then again, I'm sure the turnabout was supposed to be the idea).

It's interesting now to be able to comment in retrospect on the movie that led to the making of one of my favorite action films.The most noticeable thing about this movie, I thought, was how different Linda Hamilton's Sarah Conner was compared to the battle-hardened road warrior she was in T2. It's really weird to see her all frail, distraught, and FEMININE even, in this movie. 'Are you sure you got the right person?' she asks Kyle Reese, at one point in the movie - 'I can't even balance my cheque book!'. But of course, it is this first Arnold Schwarzenegger and this first Terminator that eventually turns her into the warrior she will be. This movie, because of its lower budget, is less glossy and less polished than its sequel. However, there is more 'grit' in the original as a result, and the effect is a darker, more atmospheric movie. Whereas T2 is an action-thriller, you could probably say that T1 is more of a horror movie - the make up they used on Arnie in the movie certainly wouldn't put him out of place in a Hellraiser, or Nightmare on Elm Street movie!As for Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton, I think these two were truly excellent - the acting is top notch - much, much better than in either Judgment Day or Rise of the Machines. The Terminator movies are, of course, mainly about a Robot\/machines, but human characters never play second fiddle in the story line - indeed, I think it is the personal relationships formed by the humans which make the movies so good - in T1, it's the passion between Kyle Reese and Sarah Conner. When they fight for each other and desperately shout encouragement at each other, it propels the move forward and gives it a certain intensity. You find yourself rooting for Kyle and Sarah, you want them to survive, and god damn it - you want Kyle to break off the Terminator's metal skull with that iron rod in the final scene! In T2, the human aspect is John Conner teaching Arnie how to 'be' more human. The moral of T2 is that if a machine which is designed with the sole purpose of killing, can be taught the value of human life ('you can't just go around killing people!') - then why can't us humans also learn this? The relationship formed between John and the Terminator is what grounds this movie, and gives it the weight needed to elevate the quality of this sequel above that of the usual hum-drum, mass-produced by the movie studios on an almost weekly basis. In T3 - well, actually, I think the 'human aspect' in the film was actually missed, and it paid the price - it's definitely the weakest in the Trilogy by a long way. While watching T3, I didn't really care what happened to the characters, and it all felt quite lightweight and superficial compared to the first two movies.Well, I guess this 'comment' has really turned into a spiel on the Terminator movies as a whole - but nevertheless, the original is arguably the best movie of the three - it's got the right atmosphere, the better characters, the Terminator theme played on a keyboard (as opposed to a synthesiser), 'I'll be back' said without a knowing verbal wink at the audience, and of course, if it wasn't for this movie, Governor Schwarenegger wouldn't be where he is today, signing graduation diplomas for the students of California.

The only complaint I have is that the story should have had her as a flat out lesbian & not bi-sexual, but that's the screenwriter's fault not Catherine's. She takes on the role of Theo with real energy. She's an actress who probably never takes on a role half heartedly. She's trying her best & she's not afraid to show interest in Lili Taylor's Nell. Also if we're going to give Nell a female love interest, why not give her one of Hollywoods most beautiful women? I applaud Catherine's performance. I also appreciated the subtlety of the Nell & Theo scenes. Their relationship was never exploited. I wish people would show this some understanding, but then again they never do.

Catherine & Lili are so interesting that they overshadow the male characters who end up coming off as very bland & boring.

True to form they originally intended to produce nothing more than a quick cheapie to cash in on the public's renewed interest in horror films. Director Rowland V. Lee had other ideas. He envisioned the film as a modern fairy tale with Frankenstein's Monster as the traditional giant ogre stalking a primordial landscape, and to be sure it is in this film that he first enters the realm of myth. To help achieve this goal he set Jack Otterson to create the most expressionistic sets of any horror film since The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. The universe of Son is a world of perpetual night and fog; rain swept castles and blasted heaths; terrifying flashes of lightening; shadowy corridors where giants lurk; hidden passage ways leading to underground crypts, where time, dust and the worm aren't the only things that move among the dead. Son of Frankenstein is the most visually impressive of all of Universal's horror films and George Robinson's gorgeous black and white cinematography captures every shadow, every out-sized distortion beautifully.This would also be the last time a Frankenstein film would have a script worthy of the subject. Willis Cooper fashioned a contemporary Grimm's fairy tale in which the journey of the film's outsiders, Wolf, Elsa, and Peter will become progressively more nightmarish the deeper they descend; where even breakfast in the morning will be overseen by a pair of monstrous gargoyles. They're journeying by train to inherit the Frankenstein estate, unknown to them a house literally at the edge of Hell, and these opening shots are the most normal in the entire film. They think of themselves as explorers and exploring something so foreign we can't even imagine what its like. They speak of the castle being haunted, while outside the window we see through the wind and the rain a gray expanse of desolation and dead trees. What a strange country! Elsa exclaims. Their passage into the subterranean netherworld of mad doctors, murderous hunchbacks and monsters has begun and will climax in a necrophilic family reunion, (We're all dead here.) in the Frankenstein crypt, in which both grandfather and father are dead, but the step-brother, the monster and family black sheep is very much alive. Do you mean to imply that is my brother? Wolf asks. Igor, the true Frankenstein family retainer replies, Only his mother was the lightening. And it is Wolf's voyage from arrogance and ignorance, (Why should we fear anything!) to humility and wisdom, (Never in my life have I known cold fear until that moment I felt his hand on my shoulder!) which is central to the film.While the film is a follow up to Bride of Frankenstein, it very much stands on its own. Gone are any references to the Bride and Dr, Praetorious, both presumably blown to atoms at the climax of that film. Also the monster doesn't speak. All traces of speech, at Karloff's insistence were eliminated. The portrait of Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein dominates the castle's study, and recalls the earlier films. In the scenes on the train Wolf refers to the, Blunder of a stupid assistant who gave his father's creation the brain of a killer instead of a normal one. This is of course, a direct reference to the first film. Karloff's return to his greatest role completes the linking of the three films. And consistent with the impressive visuals, the Monster is given his most striking look. Gone is the distinctly twentieth century black garb so beloved of the Universal Frankenstein films. Instead the Monster is clothed in a crude sheepskin jersey, with heavy shirt and trousers stitched together with strips of leather. Indeed, his whole appearance has become that of a giant, an ogre out of Grimm or Perrault. He even gets the traditional giant's club in the form of Krogh's wooden arm at the film's climax. As if to underscore this, Peter gives the Monster a present-a storybook of fairy tales!The film may have the greatest horror film cast ever. There is Karloff dominating as the Monster. Given less screen time than in the previous film, his scenes are still among his most powerful. To cite just two examples, the scene where he rises like Lucifer out of the pit is like an image from Dante's Inferno while his primal howl of grief upon discovering the dead Igor is one of the Monster's greatest moments from any of the Frankenstein films. Bela Lugosi easily has his best role after Dracula as the broken neck, hunchback, Igor. Creepy, roguish, even pitiable, one is reminded of what a fine actor he could be with a role worthy of his talent. Lionel Atwill with his beautifully clipped vocal delivery and sardonic sense of humor has his definitive screen role as the one arm Inspector Krogh; he doesn't miss any opportunity for scene stealing bits of business with that wooden arm. And there is Basil Rathbone as Wolf. He doesn't have Karloff's make-up or Lugosi's broken neck or Atwill's wooden arm, but he gives a full-blooded commanding performance that refuses to get lost in this who's who of cinematic ghouls. William K. Everson once said that only a truly great actor can get away with a little deliberate ham now and then, and if Rathbone is a little over the top, it is ham well seasoned and served and adds enormously to the enjoyment of the film. Finally Frank Skinner's incredible film score would set the standard for Universal's horror films for the next decade.

I saw this only one time -- when a college friend of mine and I used free passes to see it about 2 years ago. I never felt the urge to see it again because much of the humor simply wasn't funny. I can say that I only laughed at 2 or 3 parts1) When Mr. T makes a cameo and the theme to The A Team is played. My friend and I got a good laugh out of that, though absolutely NO ONE ELSE in the theater laughed -- I assume they were all high school aged or just beginning college and didn't understand the dated joke.2) When one of the characters is running outside dodging cars and passes by Spicolli's Television Repair Shop. I remembered Jeff Spicolli in Fast Times at Ridgemont High saying his father was a TV repairman so I found this to be a bit of a chuckle. Again, the joke is very dated and I think I'm the only one who noticed it.3) When the cast is singing and after the song they stand there like morons wondering what to do next. Great parody of Grease. I don't remember if I actually laughed at the theater, but I know I later found it funny after some thought. It mocked the reality (or lack thereof) in musicals. What exactly DO they do after the song is over? The deification (I just like using that word now) of Grease and its music was never ridiculed better.Anyway, skip this movie. It simply isn't funny enough to buy or rent. You're better off watching Crank Yankers or the Chappelle Show for better (and more) cheap laughs.

For the first few minutes of the film, I thought this would be a documentary. In a sense, when I realized when it wasn't it was a letdown, because even though this is a close-to-life depiction story of a kid in the ghettos of Washington DC, somehow if it really was a documentary it might've been even more compelling. As it is, Slam is a very naturalistic first-person drama, and the film deals with a protagonist that isn't hard to identify with, even when things seem a little over-done or even when it's a little naïve.Basic story in two sentences &#150; Raymond Joshua (Saul Williams, also one of the film's co-writers) is set up to go to prison for pot, and while in prison he meets a few people that recognize his skills as a writer and poet.When he gets out he wants to hold on to the freedom he knows he can attain, but he doesn't know how. With this conflict, Raymond is a character that is recognizable and identifiable with the audience. And with this, Williams creates a constantly believable performance even when his character may not sound entirely believable or realistic.Although the performances are a plus for the film's success, such as Bonz Malone as Hopha, and Sonja Sohn as the writing teacher\/poet Lauren, for me the style over-passed the substance. Though the poetry was inspired and the poets in the film who spoke them were very good, some of the story elements were not as effective as they could've been. For example, there's a blind-men analogy when Raymond gets out of jail and sees that his pot-dealer friend, who got shot, is now blind. Raymond is morally in the right in their final scene together, but it's a little too thick of a message for my taste when Raymond says, 'I once was blind too, now I can see.' Williams' poetry (which I assume he wrote himself) is interesting, although it's his delivery that catches my ear over the content. In a pivotal scene his poetry saves him from a beating in the prison yard, yet somehow it doesn't feel as real as some of the other scenes, like with him and Malone's character.As I said, the style was what held the film, especially for such a low budget. I loved the use of the hand-held, shaky mis-en-scene, as though someone was allowed to peek into the atmosphere of DC. And from a psychological standpoint, Levin seems to extract what the essence is of Raymond and his neighborhood. Through his usage grainy color and then to a 8mm camcorder for flashbacks from Raymond, I felt the emotional impact that Levin was going for, the mix of disorientation and of being in a free-fallin' kind of society where you don't know what can happen next. I just wished that I saw more of that with the characters and the story. Cool ending though.

It glorifies the vast accumulation of wealth because you will of course share it around, and treats military service as an inevitability not to be questioned.Now in all fairness, this is an oversimplification of the film's message. If this had been all there was to the film, it would likely have been a box-office bomb and generated as much negative feedback as it ultimately did positive. But this is the core of the film. The best that can be said for it is that it delivers this conservative message with several liberal flourishes, making it politically intriguing.For example, the single mother who gets her unqualified son into school by having sex with the principal hardly squares with the kind of persona one would usually attribute to a 50s woman who is horrified by Elvis's pelvic antics. And it is to the film's credit that while it implies stupidity to be useful in all aspects of life, it explicitly states that it is your best friend in the military. The film does vilify a lot of the youth protest movements of the 60s, but it also seems to take a sardonic glee in Edgar Wallace being shot, and it plays for laughs Forrest Gump showing his ass to Lyndon Johnson. And note the photo of Marilyn Monroe in JFK's bathroom.On paper, this would sound like an explosive movie, but most people seem to take it as just a harmless and fun experience. No doubt this is because of the core element -- Tom Hanks's performance. And honestly, this is excellent. Hanks makes Forrest Gump likable and sincere in a way few, if any, other actors could have. My personal Tom Hanks heaven will always be G.H. Dorr, PhD, from The Ladykillers, but this is deservedly some of his best-known work.

Business as usual, unfortunately the guy doesn't seem to stay dead, he climbs out of his grave a year later deep in sorrow and anger. Not so deep, however, that he neglects such important tasks as putting on make up and looking cool and stylish, if this guy is so good in his time of sadness, I'd love to see him in the better years. So the boy friend is alive and well and (as a slight bones) invincible. Rather then wondering what he is doing back on earth and how to get that lovely girl lying next to him out to be with him, he goes on a classy rampage to kill everyone who wronged him on that dire day.

I can see how in his structured mob where everyone has their place, their value, their territory, and their boss a bit of anarchy could be called for.

The story is one of revenge fueled by the jealousy and overshadowing of another composer, Court Composer Salieri (F. Murray Abraham). Mozart's work was considered the work and voice of God himself, and many including Salieri could not understand why God would give such amazing talent to such an undeserving man. Crude, vulgar, immature, and irresponsible, Mozart was all of these things...but he was also the source of music that had no equal and talent beyond all comprehension. Court Composer Salieri felt that he could not let God get away with such hypocrisy and made it his sole purpose in life to ruin and destroy the man who mocked him and highlighted his mediocrity. Through true genius and talent from many involved, Amadeus is simply, a flawless masterpiece in every aspect.Entirely deserving of it's eight Academy Awards, it seems I'm not the only one who feels this way about this film. I consider it to be perfect, but the most impressive aspect of it to me is F. Murray Abraham's performance as the vengeful and envious Salieri. Through his performance and narration, one is swept away in the emotions his character feels to the point of understanding his hatred and intentions. Possibly a little out of his mind, you can empathize with his character as his feelings hurl him towards madness and violence. His performance as an old man is incredible and entirely believable right down to every mannerism. It's amazing. This is no doubt complimented by the excellent make up work done for this part of his character, which was also awarded an Oscar. Tom Hulce was perfectly cast as Mozart, the wild and unparalleled composer. Had his performance not been equally impressive, Abraham's performance may have not been as incredible as it wouldn't have been as easy to empathize and identify with. The supporting cast is also not to go unnoticed. An overall superb casting job.Director Milos Forman achieves greatness through making a movie about music and opera, and representing his film in just such a way. Even when no performance is being given, the music in the background sets the mood for what we see on screen in an operatic way making it twice as meaningful. It is also beautifully shot, and using all natural light and no artificial lighting, we are treated to an immersing experience that makes one forget it's just a film and these are just actors. Few do this correctly, but when it is...it's truly magnificent and makes the film.
