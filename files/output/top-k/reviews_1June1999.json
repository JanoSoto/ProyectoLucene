I'm not so convinced that there's much of a story to tell since we already know how it ends. The challenge that faced Lucas in bringing the prequels to the screen is to surprise us with stories and characters for which we were not prepared and at the same time bring us up to the point of Star Wars A New Hope (#4). Lucas's story here is quite simply lazy. There is no real conflict here to care about and the characters don't have enough personality to keep us interested. What makes people think the next segment will be any different? If they already know what's going to happen, then Lucas again faces the challenge of coming up with something new and surprising to offset the predictability. People defend the new film's lack of well-developed characters by saying the original trilogy's strong suit wasn't in its well-defined characters either, but I disagree. Luke, Leia, Han, Chewbacca, R2, C3P0 and the rest are firmly embedded in fan's memories while I doubt in 17 years anyone will be talking about Qui Jon (?) and Jar Jar Binks. It was such a wasted opportunity to have the likes of Ewan McGregor and Liam Neesan and not give them some kind of discernable personality.

I never bothered to watch more than a few minutes each of the other ones. And, to tell you the truth, the only reason I saw this one was because my nine-year-old brother wasn't allowed to see it and I wanted to make him jealous. But then I ended up tacking a poster of Anakin Skywalker to my door and buying the movie novelization of this. Why? Because it turned out to be a decent movie after all! Jake Lloyd is what makes this movie good. That kid is so cute and irresistably charming. It's sad to think that Anakin will grow up to be Darth Vader. I didn't exactly get WHY this movie was happening but I guess I did get the general plot. ANAKIN! ANAKIN! ANAKIN! Go Anakin! I LOVE that kid. I hope he returns for episodes 2 and 3. And Jar Jar was, um, an interesting character, although I couldn't understand half of what he was saying. I guess I would give this movie two and a half stars out of four. Of course, based on Jake Lloyd's performance I would probably give that a three and a half out of four. So, see this movie if ya want some entertainment. It's very decent, and even if you don't like STAR WARS you might find this enjoyable. I don't think kids aged nine and under would really understand it, but there is nothing inappropriate. The only things little kids would like about it would probably be the lightsabers and the fights and the funny computer-animated characters. But, anyway, I recommend this to, well, anyone, basically. Don't expect the best, but don't expect the worst either.

This film will be thoroughly enjoyed by anyone who isn't English as the horrendous accents will remain unnoticed, hence the rave reviews by Americans, Canadians, Australians etc.  However it has to be said that since many of the actors\/actresses were English, Drew was only cast due to her status as Hollywood Wild Child turned Hip Movie Star to pull in the punters, to excuse an English expression. Without intending to offend Barrymore fans and patriot Americans alike, I can catagorically conclude that this film would have been better if the lead role had been played by an English actress who could have maintained a consistent accent which wouldn't have left me cringing in what should have been the most enjoyable moments of the movie - even though the film was set in France!

This is a must see for anyone who went to see the originals!!!Now stop reading unless you want to know what happened.  Some people have criticized the idea of Anakin falling in love with Queen Amidala. Well it doesn't even happen.  He views her as a mix of a friend, and a sort of mother-figure, since he was just separated from her.  He doesn't fall in love with her.

Nick Cage's performance is superb, and Elisabeth Shue does well too, but you can't escape the feeling that it's all just a vehicle for Cage's tour de force.  For a movie to succeed you have to care about the characters, not just wow to the actors' technical brilliance and that's why this film leaves a hollow feeling. The dialogue is just too contrived, too determined to plumb the depths. Unfortunately it just compares unfavourably to Paris,Texas. Oh, and anyone drinking as much as Cage would be dead within 24 hours. I guess if he drank less the writer would worry we didn't get the point.

George Lucas has shown no growth as a filmmaker over the last twenty years but has increased his dependence on special effects to hide a lack of storytelling ability.  The Phantom Menace has poorly developed characters, no direction to its weak story and plenty of ethnic stereotypes.  One would think a veteran director in the 90s would be able to avoid such an ignorant crutch.  The movie gets off to a horrible start when we witness his supposedly japanese trade federation officers embarrass anyone in the theater with any racial sensitivity for about twenty minutes.  The Phantom Menace wasn't a letdown but it leaves a lot to be desired.  Nothing can be expected from Lucas who can't take his work in a different direction and seems to be satisfied by gaining money instead of respect.
