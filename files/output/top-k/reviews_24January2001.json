The characters were the type that you could instantly identify with and become involved. The subject matter was also very realistic, because a lot of teens are dealing with inter-racial relationships and Jungle Fever served its purpose but it played out with Milli Vanilli. I would see this movie over and over again! Teens can appreciate it because it incorporates everything we love i.e. clubs, music, dancing, and relationships. Older people may have a problem getting into a movie that is not aimed at their demographic and you shouldn't slam a movie just because you are too old to get into it.

Now I understand why some people do not like this film.  These people do what I like to call passive viewing.  You can't just watch a film and give it the thumbs up or thumbs down.  You must PAY ATTENTION to the details that make the movie. What makes this film so great is that Welles tells his story of the newspaper tycoon not only with words but with the camera.  Every shot and person is framed accordingly for a specific reason.  For example, in the famous scene where Kane's mother signs him away to Thatcher the banker Welles uses what is called a deep focus.  The frame is set up so that from left to right it goes father, Kane, Thatcher, and Kane's mother.  The brilliance is that Kane can be seen through the window of the shot in the foreground.  The shot symbolises the struggle between kane's father and Kane's mother and Thatcher.  Kane is in the middle of this outside not knowing that his future is being decided for him while his father fights for him to stay.  Perfect deep focus shot showing the relationships and struggle over young Kane.  This is just one example that you can say but you could analyse EVERY shot in the entire film and point out why it is so brilliant. I also enjoyed the beginning of the movie where it shows the trespassing sign and then the camera works its way up the fence dissolving from fence to fence.  Then when you see the house a careful viewer would notice that as the house shots dissolve into closer shots of the house you would notice that the light on in the room never moves.  The entire shot changes except that one window with the light on never moves.  Not easy to do.  The brilliance of the shots of the fence are that they really capture how empty and closed in he was.  An active viewer would notice that these shots symbolises the jail that he built from himself.  Look around the shot next time you watch.  You will see so many things and if you think about you will understand the meaning. I think people don't enjoy this film because it requries something that most people don't like doing.

Satire that doesn't poke fun at real people isn't satire.There are occasional flashes of genuine brilliance, such as the amp that goes to 11.  Unfortunately the film shies away from the absurdity of such concepts rather than exploiting them.  Having stated the concept it is then dismissed as something only Nigel Tufnel would be stupid enough to to think.Mostly, however, the film relies upon its uncanny resemblance to a real rockumentary to entertain.  There is no question that a really effective imitation can be very entertaining.  Ask anyone who has seen an Elvis impersonator.  Aficionados of the heavy metal genre will recognize a number of allusions to real musicians here, but such allusions will be lost on less well-informed viewers.You might think that the film might be an effective parody or caricature. But the illusion is too close to the reality--parody and caricature get their humour from grossly emphasizing some aspect of the thing imitated, like making Mick Jagger's lips the size of a football.  There is none of that here.In short, there is not sufficient humour to counterweigh the essentially tragic nature of the story presented.  There is, as you might say, a very fine line between tragedy and comedy.Watch it for the cleverness and the truly fine acting throughout, but not for laughs unless you like laughing at cripples.

Who has not dreamed of flying, free from the limitation of our body, free from the restriction of the world? Who has not dreamed of becoming a master and walking through a troubled life with a brave heart? Who has not experienced, or would like to experience a love that you dare not express?And how well it tells the story! Two loves, one mature, suppressed, yet still burning like a bright star in dark night, and the other wild and impetuous, yet at the same time innocent and tender. It indeed bears many similarities to sense and sensibility. But what impressed me most is Michelle Yeoh, whose performance is truly remarkable. Her big eyes, restrained facial expressions can say a thousand things at the same time, and say them more eloquently than thousands of words. The other one I want to single out is actually Jade Fox.

It is understandable why.  The film has a disjointed, postmodern narrative surrounded by superb photography and set design.  The hero is not even a hero and the conclusion of the film, at least the director's cut, isn't all that happy.  Most of all, Blade Runner eerily shadows the near future for our own world, the future of cloning and unnaturally created humans. Science fiction has always been able to show us images of ourselves or our world in a future or alien world, things we would prefer not to see.Blade Runner's premise is simple.  Deckard (Harrison Ford) has to hunt down four &#145;Replicants' artificial humans who have great intelligence but superior physical attributes.  These replicants have run amock in space colonies and now human authorities on Earth are worried that the replicants will do the same here.All of this is really nothing more than a faint attempt at a story.  Blade Runner's success lies not with its story element, but with the amazing vision of fantasy and fear of its director, Ridley Scott.  Scott had previously made Alien, another postmodern vision of man's possible future. In that film he questioned colonisation, globalization (but on a intergalactic scale), our fascination with destriction and the corruption of modern business.  In Blade Runner, Scott explores corruption, man's destructive nature, but he also delves into emotion and the possibility of someone ELSE creating those emotions for us, as is the case for the replicants.The plot plays second fiddle to the set design and costumes.  The choice of Los Angeles being the setting for the film is brilliant at present L.A. is a city blanketed in sunshine, with an image of blonde babes and surfers all too obvious.  In Blade Runner the city is nothing like it is today.  It has become a blend of Tokyo, New York and some Eastern European wasteland of pollution.The vehicle, weapons and costumes all have a distinctive 1980's - apocalyptic - retro feel to them, the flying cars are almost too cheesy to be taken seriously, but combined with Vangelis' synthesizer score and the noir-ish feel of the narrative they fit just perfectly.Blade Runner's narrative is just that film noir.  Deckard is akin to Sam Spade, he's seen it all, been there and back, and is a tortured soul.  It's got the femme fatale, the more evil than evil villan and the corporation that is somehow responsible for all this mess.  At the same time the film is a thriller, a western and a science fiction yarn.Harrison Ford is suited as Deckard.  He is the anti-Han Solo or Indiana Jones.  Rutger Hauer is superbly evil too, it is a shame he hasn't been able to follow this up with anything as good.Many films since this have tried to show a world void of any semblances of what we take for granted today, but none have compared to Blade Runner. The film that came closest to it would be the Japanese animation Akira which also deals with similar themes.Science fiction always succeeds when the viewer is planted in the story one step beyond what might have actually happened.  See Planet of the Apes, Alien, Star Wars, et al.  In Blade Runner we get a vision of the world as it may actually be one day.

Only on second viewing could I begin to fully appreciate what it has to offer.Thematically it's similar to Clive Barker's other great film success, Hellraiser. Not just in the way that dabbling in forbidden practises will raise the undead, but in it's necessary plot contrivances. That the heroine (Helen\/Kirsty) can call forth the creature\/s which slay on sight, yet are allowed, by a tweaking of the film's own rules, to converse with their tormentors. Just as Pinhead and co. would spend their existence tearing men limb from limb the instant they solved the lamentation configuration box; here the mad slayings of Candyman are put on hold as he finds all manner of reasons, or alternate victims, to let Madsen survive to (almost) the end of the film. However, this is neatly explained by Candyman's desire for her, proving he's a man who knows all about the birds and... er... the bees.Its subtext is what makes the film most rewarding. Not only does it play on accepted urban myth and superstition (even though the particular myth is fabricated, I find very few people WILL dare to say his name five times), but also sociological fears. Or, in the same sense, urban myths again. That is, the myth of the white woman being subjugated by the black man.Of course, this being a horror film, even one well above the intellectual average, it does round up the usual stereotypes. A fellow lecturer, the most pompous and self-important character in the whole film, is English, while the policewoman who orders Madsen to strip for searching is a butch bulldog of a woman who obviously receives sexual gratification from said task.There is also some nice quizzical gothic music throughout, which can get a little over the top and pretentious, but is generally quite beautiful. The notion of Helen's sanity is often called into question, and we see scenes where Candyman cannot be picked up by camera, causing us to believe it may all be in her mind. This also leads to some black humour as various characters double take at the sheer number of mitigating circumstances Helen finds herself under.Yet what initially made me dislike the film is its fundamental lack of scariness. The use of mirrors is always a guaranteed spooker, though the name Candyman had only previously seen the inside of cinemas when sung about in Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. The fact that when Candyman does arrive he's dressed like a camp pimp and has a tendency for poetic prose didn't add to the fear factor. I must admit to finding Tony Todd a little scarier this time around as the first time I thought he was putting on a ludicrously deep voice. It turns out that this is Todd's real voice, though it still seems to be siphoned through some form of modulator. His somewhat exaggerated supernatural powers and fleeting appearances led me to conclude that this was a scary movie that forgot the scary, but then of course that's missing the point.Candyman is both victor and victim rolled into one, a phantom of the opera for the nineties. His literary origins are quite impeccable, and when the book of Frankenstein is mentioned towards the start of the movie, this is counterbalanced by an ending that references the 1931 adaptation by Universal. He has a hypnotic hold over women, like a Dracula\/De Sade hybrid, and his rapport with Helen means that this could justifiably be seen as a romantic movie. Perhaps not a good idea to take someone out on a date to see it though. Only a predictable and trite coda really detracts from what is a thoughtful, and thought-provoking, modern horror.The same choral themes occur in the pointless sequel, Farewell to the Flesh. However, this merely serves to illustrate how mainstream and tacky the follow-up is. While it's an established rule that sequels are rarely as good as their predecessors, this is &#150; Bride of Frankenstein and Dawn of the Dead possible exceptions &#150; doubly true with horror sequels. Before you can say Freddy 2-6 or Michael Myers 2-7, Candyman re-emerges onto the scene with souped-up gore, dumbed-down dialogue and an irritating DJ who narrates the thing for the hard of thinking. A sort of Annie through the Looking Glass as Kelly Rowan tries to find the one big mirror that can finally destroy the Candyman. Everything is spelt out in this one, including a depiction of his death which is unnecessary and nowhere near as striking as it was when narrated in the first. Of course, the real problem is that Candyman is such a self-contained story that it doesn't NEED a sequel. But Hollywood beckoned with its chequebook and so even if Candyman 3 wasn't intentionally the end of the series, it would have killed it off anyway. Avoid the inferior follow-ups, watch Candyman as a solo work... it's really quite wonderful.

The notion of Helen's sanity is often called into question, and we see scenes where Candyman cannot be picked up by camera, causing us to believe it may all be in her mind.

The use of mirrors is always a guaranteed spooker, though the name Candyman had only previously seen the inside of cinemas when sung about in Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. The fact that when Candyman does arrive he's dressed like a camp pimp and has a tendency for poetic prose didn't add to the fear factor.

It turns out that this is Todd's real voice, though it still seems to be siphoned through some form of modulator. His somewhat exaggerated supernatural powers and fleeting appearances led me to conclude that this was a scary movie that forgot the scary, but then of course that's missing the point.Candyman is both victor and victim rolled into one, a phantom of the opera for the nineties. His literary origins are quite impeccable, and when the book of Frankenstein is mentioned towards the start of the movie, this is counterbalanced by an ending that references the 1931 adaptation by Universal. He has a hypnotic hold over women, like a Dracula\/De Sade hybrid, and his rapport with Helen means that this could justifiably be seen as a romantic movie. Perhaps not a good idea to take someone out on a date to see it though. Only a predictable and trite coda really detracts from what is a thoughtful, and thought-provoking, modern horror.The same choral themes occur in the pointless sequel, Farewell to the Flesh.

A sort of Annie through the Looking Glass as Kelly Rowan tries to find the one big mirror that can finally destroy the Candyman. Everything is spelt out in this one, including a depiction of his death which is unnecessary and nowhere near as striking as it was when narrated in the first. Of course, the real problem is that Candyman is such a self-contained story that it doesn't NEED a sequel.

Only on second viewing could I begin to fully appreciate what it has to offer.Thematically it's similar to Clive Barker's other great film success, Hellraiser. Not just in the way that dabbling in forbidden practises will raise the undead, but in it's necessary plot contrivances. That the heroine (Helen\/Kirsty) can call forth the creature\/s which slay on sight, yet are allowed, by a tweaking of the film's own rules, to converse with their tormentors. Just as Pinhead and co. would spend their existence tearing men limb from limb the instant they solved the lamentation configuration box; here the mad slayings of Candyman are put on hold as he finds all manner of reasons, or alternate victims, to let Madsen survive to (almost) the end of the film. However, this is neatly explained by Candyman's desire for her, proving he's a man who knows all about the birds and... er... the bees.Its subtext is what makes the film most rewarding. Not only does it play on accepted urban myth and superstition (even though the particular myth is fabricated, I find very few people WILL dare to say his name five times), but also sociological fears. Or, in the same sense, urban myths again. That is, the myth of the white woman being subjugated by the black man.Of course, this being a horror film, even one well above the intellectual average, it does round up the usual stereotypes.

This is a difficult enough prospect when you're dealing with real characters like bankers, lawyers, or mobsters.   At least in these instances the actors have the option of studying the lives of or spending time with people in those positions.  But how do you instill the proper motivation for someone who is portraying a mythical character, such as demon, a werewolf or a vampire?  If you're lucky, you can still go to the source, but the learning curve could prove to be fatal.F W Murnau is a stickler for authenticity - he believes that every character's performance in every film must feel as realistic as possible. Nosferatu his latest film is sure to raise the bar - based on an unsavory Count with a penchant for blood sucking, Murnau needs to find someone who can bring him to life on the big screen.  Imagine his joy upon discovering Max Schreck, a real vampire, who is willing to work for scale, or at least a few actors on the scales. I have never seen Nosferatu in its entirety, but have always marveled at its ability to convey terror using limited special effects and basic lighting techniques.   Even with these limitations, Schreck's Count Orlock continues to be one of the most terrifying vampires ever brought to the screen.  I was therefore thrilled by Dafoe's portrayal in this film - between the makeup and his mannerisms he is fantastic.  Not only is Dafoe's Schreck darkly menacing, he has a sense of humor and curiosity as well.  Of course, being a vampire he also tends to be a tad unpredictable, biting bites, sucking back vodka, and snacking on the cast between takes.   Malkovich is also excellent as the obsessive, and annoying Murnau.  It is only when you realize the deal that has been struck between these two that you begin to wonder who the real monster of the piece is - at least Shreck kills to survive.   Eddie Izzard's portrayal of Gustav is so similar to the original that it is quite eerie.  This attention to detail extends to the film itself.  Unlike Gus Van Sant's pointless and painfully boring 1998 remake of Psycho, which was merely a copy of the original film scene for scene and shot for shot, Nosferatu merely serves as the background for  Shadow.  The recreated scenes are cleverly done and blend seamlessly with the few original shots.  In addition, the film is careful not to take itself too seriously, and has a B movie, slapstick undercurrent running throughout.

But how do you instill the proper motivation for someone who is portraying a mythical character, such as demon, a werewolf or a vampire?  If you're lucky, you can still go to the source, but the learning curve could prove to be fatal.F W Murnau is a stickler for authenticity - he believes that every character's performance in every film must feel as realistic as possible. Nosferatu his latest film is sure to raise the bar - based on an unsavory Count with a penchant for blood sucking, Murnau needs to find someone who can bring him to life on the big screen.  Imagine his joy upon discovering Max Schreck, a real vampire, who is willing to work for scale, or at least a few actors on the scales. I have never seen Nosferatu in its entirety, but have always marveled at its ability to convey terror using limited special effects and basic lighting techniques.   Even with these limitations, Schreck's Count Orlock continues to be one of the most terrifying vampires ever brought to the screen.  I was therefore thrilled by Dafoe's portrayal in this film - between the makeup and his mannerisms he is fantastic.  Not only is Dafoe's Schreck darkly menacing, he has a sense of humor and curiosity as well.  Of course, being a vampire he also tends to be a tad unpredictable, biting bites, sucking back vodka, and snacking on the cast between takes.   Malkovich is also excellent as the obsessive, and annoying Murnau.  It is only when you realize the deal that has been struck between these two that you begin to wonder who the real monster of the piece is - at least Shreck kills to survive.   Eddie Izzard's portrayal of Gustav is so similar to the original that it is quite eerie.  This attention to detail extends to the film itself.  Unlike Gus Van Sant's pointless and painfully boring 1998 remake of Psycho, which was merely a copy of the original film scene for scene and shot for shot, Nosferatu merely serves as the background for  Shadow.  The recreated scenes are cleverly done and blend seamlessly with the few original shots.  In addition, the film is careful not to take itself too seriously, and has a B movie, slapstick undercurrent running throughout. Except for a few slow-moving sections, film buffs will thoroughly enjoy this take on the horror genre and its commentary on film-making in general.

It certainly is food for thought as far as movies go, an excellent script.Paul Scofield, in the role of Sir Thomas More, walks a thin and delicate line as Chancellor, for while he must remain loyal to his king, Henry VIII, he does not abandon his own principles on what he deems right. King Henry wants an heir to the throne and will not allow anything to stand in his way to divorce his wife and remarry. This results in his breaking ties with the Holy Roman Empire (the Pope) in his pursuit of a divorce. It also involves his loyal subjects who must acknowledge the legality of such a remarriage, otherwise they are considered disloyal and are doomed.Wendy Hiller, as Alice More, the devoted wife of Sir Thomas, shows us how her husband's decision causes a total domestic upheaval and unfortunate circumstances for all family members and servants as well. I think Susannah York's portrayal as the daughter Margaret is very expressive too as she attempts to reason with her father in his final days. Everyone is greatly challenged indeed to find an inner strength to face the inevitable realities.I would consider the film Anne of a Thousand Days as a twin companion to this movie as they are so identical in many ways, both dealing with the subject of King Henry VIII's remarriage(s), the consequences thereof, and of innocent lives being hopelessly given up for the cause of preserving the monarchy.This is Drama at its best!

While adhering to a very specific narrative which includes a love story, a murder trial and the re-creation of a mostly forgotten historical tragedy, this film provides an impressionistic, elliptical and deeply poetic cinematic experience. I can't think of a movie that brings the viewer so deeply into the interior lives of its characters without resorting to voice-over. The melding of visuals, music, sound effects and  editing is seamless. One of Von Sydow's great performances. An ensemble cast close to perfection. I discovered this on DVD. Apparantly overlooked in 1999 by critics, this was clearly Best Picture material for that year. I was not a great fan of Shine but this makes me want to see it again. Looking forward to Hicks' next film. ","genre":null},{"date":"24 January 2001","score":"","review":"  Put aside all pre-conceived notions of what a movie should be.
