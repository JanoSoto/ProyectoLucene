This movie oozes a worthiness for loving it few movies do. Because underneath its mix of genres, it's the most unnoticed one which ends up revealing itself as the most important affecting drama.Ed Wood is an all-around player. It has tons of humor (white and dark), including many comic scenes and hilarious characters. It has an experimental feel too, reflected on a couple of bizarre shots. It is an impeccable drama, full of feeling and transcendent events. But in the end, Ed Wood is, overall, a sort of a romantic comedy between the characters and the audience. I know it sounds pedantic and weird, but remember this thought when the final credits roll.What does this feeling come from? It comes from Tim Burton's genuine love for the characters. No matter how pathetic they are, Tim shows love for them in every shot, and he shows it so well that the affection is contagious. You just can't help but feel that Ed, Bela, Tor and Vampira have been there in your life forever. They are family.And just because of that, the film is so affecting. Bash me if you want, but Bela Lugosi's death saddened me more than 200 dramas. The affectionate friendship between Ed and Bela is touching, and Bela's death put an end to that. It also helped the fact that Martin Landau nails the character, playing the role of his life. His performance is one of the most astonishing I've ever seen, and clearly one of the three main reasons to watch this movie. Hats off.Tim Burton is in top form too, constructing, in my opinion, an almost perfect film that ranks first in his work. Other Burton's movies are tremendous, but this simply has it all awesome performances, intelligent script, prominent aesthetics, historical accuracy (although this is not an inherent value in Burton's work, it is here), and a jaw-dropping direction. Just take a look at the scene that takes place inside the spook train and you'll know what I'm saying. There's a care for detail too that shows in credits, music...And one more thing if you don't laugh with this film, you're dead.RATING 9.8 ","genre":null},{"date":"31 January 2005","score":"8 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" When thinking about Ed Wood there is a word that always comes to my mind in first charm.

The very fact that Newt and Hicks are bumped off at the beginning is the gun-blast to the race; it shows immediately that Fincher isn't afraid to 'take out' characters, unlike most other action\/thrill\/horror films. This film took the genre back to its roots; Aliens was a gung-ho splash, and strayed too far from the ideology and concept that Alien stands for; being hunted with no sanctuary. Insanity is another medium that Fincher expressed; whether it be the wails of the manic-depressive Golic or Dillion's Christian Fundmanetalist brew, the composition of the characters is rich and diverse. Weaver is excellent as the tired Ripley, who has been pushed so far by the menace she no longer cares for her life. And the prisoners - you actually feel sorry for the (pretty nasty) skinheads when they get picked off, one by one. Esepcially when they dedicate themselves to destroy the Alien. The gradual deterioration from order to brutal anarchy is both subtle and hideous, and can be compared to a futuristic Lord of the Flies. You, the viewer, is fully aware that the system will collapse under the Alien, and can only watch as the inmates suffer blow after deadly blow.And the ending; what an ending! The very fact that Morse is the only survivor shows just how unpredictable this film is; I don't know about you, but I expected '85, Dillion and Ripley to survive. And thats why I love this move; it defies stereotypical hero survival. The very fact the prisoners team up to kill the 'dragon' at the expense of their own lives is symbolic of human courage that exists within everyone, that co-operation is the only thing that can redeem mankind.Overall, this film is dark, brooding and thoroughly fulfilling. The chase scenes in the lead-works are worthy of a mention of themselves; a mix between adrenaline and hysteria as we see the raw fear of the hunted Convicts. People don't like the third installment because they do not appreciate that this film is a dark portrayal of human nature and must be seen with an open-mind rather than bitter comparison to the other movies.

The film opens as we see Gantry holding court around a table in a bar, telling jokes and anecdotes of sexual conquests one minute, and then the next minute is helping out two wayward parishioners by passing the hat around the bar and preaching in earnest the word of God. Lancaster plays out the duality in the role of Gantry as everyman\/ preacher brilliantly throughout the film. We're witness to his meteoric rise within the ranks of the religious road show, we see his stumbles within those ranks and his eventual fall from popularity to an even more impossible grace under fire (literally), but most importantly we see the ability of his character to serve both his rise and fall in ways truly unexpected. Gantry finds that there are many who will listen to him wax eloquent on the bible. But when Gantry sees Sister Sharon Falconer (as played by Jean Simmons) he forgets about getting closer to the lord and decides to ingratiate himself into her 'inner circle'. Gantry can see that the 'old time religion show' is a soul saver on Sunday, but quite a moneymaker on Monday. There are 'two very different' Gantry's, the one who has a lifetime of sexual anecdotes and the other who's true love is for the bible. What we are not in store for is the third Gantry; the one in love with Elmer Gantry and his own voice. In any case, Gantry sees a golden opportunity to satisfy all three Gantry's and he goes for it. Through his ability to con and sweet talk his way to the top, Gantry makes all of the right friends and maneuvers himself to a spot underneath Sister Sharon Falconer. Gantry's fall comes in the form of Lulu Baines (as played by Shirley Jones), a prostitute with a past history with Gantry. As Gantry's popularity on the 'road show' circuit starts to hit its zenith, Baines appears into Gantry's life once again as she sets up Gantry for blackmail. How Gantry deals with Baines and the loss of trust from Sister Sharon is one of the best moments from the film. And although her time on screen doesn't come close to matching that of both Lancaster and Simmons, it is the performance of Jones in one scene that practically steals the show. Jones' speech to the ladies in the brothel about Gantry Ramming the fear of God so fast into her was exhilaratingly fun and mildly erotic. I would think it was largely this scene that got her noticed by the Academy in 1960.However great Lancaster is as Gantry (Oscar winning performance) and spectacular Jones is as Baines (another Oscar winner), let us not forget how easy it would have been for this movie to have THREE Oscar WINNERS!!! Yes, Jean Simmons was robbed by the Academy that year. I think there are at least three reasons as to why Jean Simmons was not given the Oscar that year. One is the brutally lame ending to the movie. Sister Sharon is left to walk about the fiery inferno of her newly built church, while everyone around her is knocking her to the ground trying to escape. Sister Sharon is oblivious to human stampedes and is more concerned in urging everyone to remain calm. A performance that must not have been lost on John Landis when he made Kevin Bacon reprise it in 'Animal House' some 18 years later (sans the fire). It was a shame to see her babbling like an idiot while certain death surrounded her. That's one reason, but the other two reasons are probably more to the truth. You see, Jean Simmons wasn't the only actress who can claim to have been robbed on Oscar night, so could Shirley Maclaine. The Oscar could have gone to either one, but if it had gone to Jean Simmons, The Academy would've had a hard time giving any award to the 'The Apartment' or its director Billy Wilder. How could 'Elmer Gantry' win three of the four main awards yet not walk away with the Best Picture? It's also been said the Academy felt bad for Elizabeth Taylor as she was not only recovering from the recent death of her husband, Michael Todd, but also that she had just needed an emergency tracheotomy only weeks before the awards. However, one point should be clear, Elizabeth Taylor never should have won the Oscar over the performances that year from Simmons or Maclaine.Another performer from the movie who gives a great performance is Arthur Kennedy as Jim Lefferts. Lefferts is the skeptical newsman who follows the 'road show' waiting to see a miracle or perhaps to see many a false prophet fall. One scene that stands out is the scene where Lefferts is dictating an article on the exploits of Lancaster and Simmons' religious road show. While he is dictating he is also absent-mindedly sharpening a pencil. As Lefferts comments become to take on more of a cynical tone, the pencil in his hand also becomes sharper. Once Lefferts is through with his thought, the pencil has been sharpened to a fine point and his thoughts are ready for print. He writes, Is it a church, is it a religion or is it a circus sideshow complete with freaks, magic and rabble rousing? This is a fine film with a slightly disappointing ending. I can't accept that the errant fling of a cigarette can flash through the heavens like a message from God, but if ever a bolt of lightning was captured onto the silver screen, it was the bolt from Burt Lancaster as Elmer Gantry. 9\/10.Clark Richards ","genre":null},{"date":"31 January 2005","score":"51 out of 61 people found the following review useful","review":" And there was light---9\/10.All you need to know about the character of Elmer Gantry is neatly summed up in the first 10 minutes of the film.

He writes, Is it a church, is it a religion or is it a circus sideshow complete with freaks, magic and rabble rousing? This is a fine film with a slightly disappointing ending. I can't accept that the errant fling of a cigarette can flash through the heavens like a message from God, but if ever a bolt of lightning was captured onto the silver screen, it was the bolt from Burt Lancaster as Elmer Gantry. 9\/10.Clark Richards ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"31 January 2005","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" This is such a wondrous and hilarious movie..

I'm freaking sure that if somebody could have magically told them that thanks to their work, a movie like 'Alien' would have been made in the future, they both would have died of a sudden, shocked by the consequences of their labor, like an honest scientist would if he was shown an evil use of his research. In that sense, but in the best way imaginable, 'Alien' is the atomic bomb.In my opinion, 'Alien' is the only perfect movie in the history of cinema. Of course, this could be debatable, but of all the films I've watched since I was born, this is the only one in which I haven't been able to find the slightest flaw. It gets a golden ten out of ten. Bright, solid and massive.I could go on with a panegyric, but I'll try to be short and accurateThe direction is just perfect. Every shot is marvellous, every movement of the camera is breathtaking. There is absolutely nothing you could add or subtract. Touch it, and you spoil it. Seriously.The acting is splendid. The performances build a credible world centuries away. I don't know about you, but this take on the future was unveliabably acceptable. Sigourney Weaver is more than a revelation, John Hurt is a master, and the rest are nothing short of marvellous.The script is a work of art, the story is mesmerizing, well-constructed, well-developed, and free of absurd twists. Its simplicity and efectiveness are yet, 25 years after, to be matched.The atmosphere is pure genius. Gothic, claustrophobic and sometimes baroque. The use of light and dark is beyond description, the use of sound is as creepy as it gets.The FX are the best possible for 1979. In the time of the release, some scenes were stomach churning.The score. Jerry Goldsmith's work matches the images so perfectly it seems to bleed from them. It is and will be the best soundtrack for a sci-fi flick in space ever.The tagline. In space, no one can hear you scream. THIS is a tagline.And, of course... the alien. The only alive creature that can steal Weaver the movie. Its design is the most innovative I've seen. It has spawned dozens of disgraceful imitations. This is the real deal. Not only the look, but the complete design of a life form, including biological features. Acid instead of blood. Jaws inside jaws. What more could you possibly want? This is how a movie is done.A very good sign of a movie that has gone down in history is the amount of collectively well remembered scenes. Well, 'Alien' has so many that I won't go into it. This movie contains so many iconic scenes that has become an icon itself.So, what else? I urge all young directors to watch this movie a zillion times, as I've already done, and take notes all along. But not in order to rip off from it, as many others have done, but to learn, learn, learn, learn and learn how a movie should be done. 'Casablanca'? You must be joking.Oh, I almost forget!

These things whether perceived or actual make no difference to a movies watchability, rateabaility or greatness. OK, there may be some people who love to waste two hours trying to decipher some deranged directors intentions or underlying concept, theme, plot or conclusion but just because you wish to do so or actually think that you did find some startling interpretations in the movie does not make it a good one. Most of you are the ones who like to appear clever on these boards by impressing strangers with your irrelevant findings.Don't get me wrong, I'm not scared of thinking about a movie, I do enjoy the occasional no brainer action flick and a laugh-a-minute comedy but I'm always on the lookout for a thinking mans flick. MD just confuses the viewer by twisting stories, character & dialogue without any meaning or conclusion. I feel a movie MUST make sense even if a bit of thought is involved, this movie does not satisfy any of the viewers thirst for plot, suspense, action, emotion or conclusion.If you must, view this movie only for its hype or to satisfy your own curiosity. but don't expect much. Do yourself a favour, go hire The Pianist, Amelie, Bad Boys 2, 8 mile, Fight Club, Toy Story, 25th hour, The Girl next door, Dawn of the Dead, Bridget Jones or any other great flick from the Genre of your choice, Sit back, Interpret how you will and enjoy a proper, magnificent film the way Hollywood intended.If you've gotten this far, Thanks for reading....!!!!

However, it appears that the present day interests him enough to awake and forge a career as a rock star. He has become highly successful and openly admits he is a Vampire to the press, although nobody seems to actually believe him. He lives off the blood of female groupies that his Manager Roger (Tiriel Mora) picks up and brings him. A woman named Jesse (Marguerite Moreau) who works for 'Talamasca Center for Paranormal Studies, London', listens to some of Lestat's lyrics and is convinced that he is a real Vampire because he talks of a pub called the 'Admiral Arms' and various other silly things. Jesse's friend and colleague David Talbot (Paul McGann) says that the organisation knows of Lestat and are already onto him. David gives Jesse Lestat's journal to read which chronicles Lestat's life, how he was turned into a Vampire by Marius De Romanus (Vincent Perez) and how he first came across the Queen of all Vampires, Akasha (Aaliyah) who was at the time some sort of weird statue. Jesse becomes obsessed with Lestat and heads to the 'Admiral Arms' in which she finds acts of Vampirism taking place. There she meets Lestat who lets her live. Lestat heads back to Los Angeles to prepare for a sell-out concert. Jesse follows him. It appears that most Vampires dislike Lestat for his high public profile, which is drawing unwanted attention to all Vampires and not just himself, and they want him dead. While in Los Angeles Lestat is contacted by Marius who he hasn't seen in nearly 200 years, he begins to fall for Jesse when they meet again and Akasha makes an appearance as she plans to wipe out the human race and rule the Earth with Lestat by her side as King and Queen! All this while trying to prepare for a big concert too! Will the Vampires successfully assassinate Lestat? Will Akasha wipe out the entire human race? Will Lestat turn Jesse into a Vampire and condemn her to eternal life as a blood-sucking Vampire? Who cares? Directed by Micheal Rymer I hated this film. This film isn't horror as far as I'm concerned. It's as much horror as a music video. The script by Scott Abbott and Micheal Petroni based on the Novels 'The Vampire Chronicles' by Anne Rice is an absolute mess. It tries to have various story lines going but forgets about them during the film, it also fails to juggle the various sub-plots so that I cared about or even remembered them. The flash back to Lestat's early years is almost redundant, Akasha's plan to take over the world isn't even mentioned until the last half an hour or so, Jesse at first is trying to track Lestat down as part of her job but that is also quickly ditched as she becomes the love interest, Lestat as a rock star is only really focused on during two scenes, there's a scene where Lestat and Akasha fly to an island and well, I'm not really sure as it's so choppy as to be almost incoherent and generally speaking there just isn't a single focused story going on. There is a typical Hollywood 'happy ending' that almost made me sick. It's really slow and boring too. There's no blood, gore, violence or Vampire action except a ripped out heart a bloodless decapitation and a couple of Vampire fights with awful CGI effects that are simply embarrassing to watch. Having said that I did like the way Akasha died, but it only lasts for about a minute so doesn't compensate for the lack of any decent horror throughout the rest of the film. The acting is poor and no one looks particularly interested, Aaliyah stands out as being as rotten and miscast as anyone else and she looks like she should still be in school! It's quite well made but for a film with a budget this big that's the least I expect. Just to round this terrible film of and add insult to injury is the soundtrack which features mind numbingly bad rock tracks throughout. I hate this film. Avoid if at all possible, you'll be glad you did.

However, I feel that it is too close to the play and too over the top. Branagh put almost every single line that Shakespeare wrote into the film, which makes it difficult to understand. As Hamlet, Branagh tries too much to stick to the pentameter, making his speeches sound unnatural, like he's reciting something instead of talking. I like the way the difficult lines are cut out in the Mel Gibson version.I also find that Hamlet is a bit too emotional (cries too much). I do understand that given his situation, he would be a bit unstable. But Branagh did his emotions a bit too much.The ghost scene is over the top. So is the scene when he's yelling at Ophelia. I like the idea of the one-sided mirror, but he shouldn't have shot the scene from the glass side. The scene is not supposed to be funny, but it's hard to resist laughing at the shot of Ophelia's face squashed against the glass.I think Hamlet is a bit too old. I imagine him to be in his twenties, not thirty to forty. His goatee is a bit unnecessary, so is his white-blonde hair that makes him even older. Claudius looks too nice to be a scheming rat who's always drunk. He looks like he could be a Santa Claus.I do like the fact that they changed the time to more modern style, and the costumes and the set are well done--correct to the time period and eye-pleasing. I also like the fact that they played out the scenes when someone reference to a scene not in the play (like the murder, the love scene), so that it's easier to visualize. As for the love scene, no, Shakespeare never said that there ever was something that close between Hamlet and Ophelia, that's the director's interpretation, which is fine. It makes it that it would be even harder for either of them to accept the break-up.Overall, it's a good film to watch for studying the play, but not too great as entertainment.

But it plods along, documenting the making of a wedding quilt that incorporates the lives of each person who contributes to it. Finn Dodd (what a hideous name), played by Ryder, at her tentative and mysterious best, is spending the summer with her aunts, while finishing her thesis. She is also engaged to Sam (Mulroney), who seems to get needier, as Finn seems to be getting coldfeet. The quilt is a gift for Finn's wedding, and is a labor of love among a group of women whose lives are intertwined in the northern California wine country, each of them sewing a panel that expresses the theme, Where love resides. But love resides in many different places among these women &#150; from sisters Glady Jo and Hy, entertainingly played by Bancroft and Burstyn, who are exactly the kinds of aunts anyone would like to have in their family, to the prickly Em (Simmons), and the unconventional Constance (Nelligan). So many different stories, as interpreted in quilting panels, do not always make a pretty quilt, and much negotiating and compromise is the very nature of putting the quilt together, as it is in life. Not Ryder's best work, but Burstyn and Bancroft are delightful as the pot-smoking aunts, rockin' out to Neil Diamond's Cherry, Cherry. Simmons is a pleasure to see &#150; with quite a lengthy career behind her, she doesn't appear often. Samantha Mathis is always charming &#150; it would be nice if things would really *click* for her career. Kate Nelligan is fabulous &#150; I was never able to abide her work, presuming her to be like the kind of tight-assed, judgmental characters that she portrayed. But I unexpectedly caught her in Frankie and Johnny (with Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer), and could not believe I was watching the woman I had scorned for so long. Now I look forward to seeing her every time she appears. In spite of many fascinating and multi-faceted characterizations, this vehicle does not serve any of these actresses well. One expects Greatness out of such an enormous and worthy cast, but the Entertain-o-meter stops short of Just Okay, and one wishes that such talent had been applied to a script that utilized their collective talent better. The concept of the story revolving around this group-effort is a fine concept, but director, Moorhouse, has to work hard to keep the story from fragmenting into oblivion. Though not weighing in as a heavyweight, the multitude of fine performances ensures that it is fine entertainment on a lazy day.

Seeking more excitement in his life, he takes an interest in a collection of people in a local pub who the barman describes as criminals. Despite this Alan approaches the woman of the group &#150; the sexy and charming Beatrice, but is surprised when she responds to his advances. As he gets to know her, he uncovers a damaged soul with a murky past and dark present that perhaps he would be keep out of; however, as much as he is put off he is drawn in and soon finds himself involved deeper than he had ever planned.I'll be honest and say that I was only drawn to this film by the strange title; other than that I had no idea what it was about but decided to give it a stab anyway. However the film seems to be aiming for a mood rather than a narrative and, as a result, this film is more about the tone and feel and thus it fails to really engage because the story isn't there. Well, there is a story but it comes second to the mood and it isn't well developed, is full of illogical holes that just don't convince and feels like a mishmash of other films' ideas. It is interesting at points but ultimately it doesn't work. The film tries to be seedy and introspective, using smoky rooms, jazz and crime as motivators and the normal guy as our way in, but even this doesn't totally work and elements of it failing make it feel like it has all been forced from the start &#150; certainly the choice of the jazz music is way off.However, as the title suggests, the film is more about Beatrice than the other characters and, as such, it is interesting enough even if she isn't as well developed a character as a character driven film would usually require. The performance from Argento is good and she has a real sexy presence that is more than just her taking her clothes off for the cameras &#150; it is an aspect of her character that the film uses well. Harris is every bit as bland as the music he plays and he is the reason why I never bought the main relationship once &#150; OK, she's after a nice guy but would she go for someone so very bland? The rest of the cast are colourful enough and do OK work with very basic material; Rhys-Meyers is good, Everett does his usual lazy, bi-sexual performance, Hart has a small role and the rest are just basic East End thug sorts.Overall this is a film to watch for the sexy, dark presence of Argento and that alone. Outside of her, the narrative is pretty weak and never really convinced me or involved me; the dramatic fireworks come and go without really doing much and by the end I was pretty bored by the whole affair. Argento and some of the support cast make it worth a go but, like Harris and his type of jazz music, this film is consistently bland and uninteresting.

The rest of the cast are colourful enough and do OK work with very basic material; Rhys-Meyers is good, Everett does his usual lazy, bi-sexual performance, Hart has a small role and the rest are just basic East End thug sorts.Overall this is a film to watch for the sexy, dark presence of Argento and that alone. Outside of her, the narrative is pretty weak and never really convinced me or involved me; the dramatic fireworks come and go without really doing much and by the end I was pretty bored by the whole affair. Argento and some of the support cast make it worth a go but, like Harris and his type of jazz music, this film is consistently bland and uninteresting.

Seeking more excitement in his life, he takes an interest in a collection of people in a local pub who the barman describes as criminals. Despite this Alan approaches the woman of the group &#150; the sexy and charming Beatrice, but is surprised when she responds to his advances. As he gets to know her, he uncovers a damaged soul with a murky past and dark present that perhaps he would be keep out of; however, as much as he is put off he is drawn in and soon finds himself involved deeper than he had ever planned.I'll be honest and say that I was only drawn to this film by the strange title; other than that I had no idea what it was about but decided to give it a stab anyway. However the film seems to be aiming for a mood rather than a narrative and, as a result, this film is more about the tone and feel and thus it fails to really engage because the story isn't there. Well, there is a story but it comes second to the mood and it isn't well developed, is full of illogical holes that just don't convince and feels like a mishmash of other films' ideas. It is interesting at points but ultimately it doesn't work. The film tries to be seedy and introspective, using smoky rooms, jazz and crime as motivators and the normal guy as our way in, but even this doesn't totally work and elements of it failing make it feel like it has all been forced from the start &#150; certainly the choice of the jazz music is way off.However, as the title suggests, the film is more about Beatrice than the other characters and, as such, it is interesting enough even if she isn't as well developed a character as a character driven film would usually require. The performance from Argento is good and she has a real sexy presence that is more than just her taking her clothes off for the cameras &#150; it is an aspect of her character that the film uses well.

Putting the squeeze on the store leads them to a couple of new people, specifically a smooth French criminal called Alain Charnier who is trying to orchestrate a massive drug sale in New York. The pressure looks like bringing success to Detectives Doyle and Russo, but Charnier's organisation has tight time targets and decides to take action to remove the heat from the job.Sometimes with classic films it is easy to get sucked into the hype and reputation and just love it before you have even seen it; for that reason, although I have seen it several times, I decided to give it a fresh viewing before I dared try to write my thoughts on it &#150; it finished ten minutes ago, so my memory is still fresh. Although I feel that it has remained well known thanks to that car chase, I think that recalling only that scene is to do a disservice to a film that is an enjoyable thriller in a tough, typically 1970's mould. The plot sees a minor hunch turn into a bigger police job and it would be easy to pick holes in some of the logic within it, it still grips and provides a nicely gritty cop thriller. It isn't as clever or as original as those coming to it on the back of its reputation might expect it to be, as it does pretty much what the rest of the genre does. Now I'll be fair and acknowledge that I don't know whether this film was the first to create this type of film or if it was just part of the development of them, but certainly watching it now it does blend in with others in the same genre.The direction makes it better than the material as Friedkin injects real tension and grit into the story keeping it exciting while also being rather sombre and low-key. The acting also makes it and, rightly, Hackman carries much of the film with a great performance as Doyle. Grizzled, bigoted and apparently heartless, it is interesting to contrast his character with Rey's Charnier, who is much cooler and effective. Scheider is, as always, reliable in support and he gives a good performance throughout while the rest of the cast play their roles well enough. There is no doubt though, that Hackman is the heart of the film and his performance reflects this and makes the audience emotionally involved with his story from the very start.Overall this is a great 1970's cop thriller with all that comes with that genre. It is enjoyably gritty and fast paced with heroes of questionable morality and smooth criminals. People will always hark on about that car chase and, yes, it is good, but there is more to this film and it stands out as one of the best of the genre.

Every movie is a challenge and every time you'll find yourself being fascinated by the (sometimes weird) characters and the gripping story.With this movie he has done exactly that, he has made a very touching but sometimes weird movie. It's about a single mother, Manuela, who lives with her only son in Madrid. He dies on his 17th birthday as he runs to seek an actress's autograph and gets hit by a car. The father, a transvestite who works as a prostitute in Barcelona, didn't even know he had a son, let alone that he knows the kid died. The mother decides that she'll pay him a visit and tell him all about his son. Looking for him (her), she meets Rosa, a young nun who is about to leave for El Salvador. A beautiful friendship between the two women starts and as the story goes on, they will help each other through some very hard times (Rosa appears to be pregnant and HIV-positive). In the meantime Manuela has also started working as the personal assistant of the same actress her son wanted an autograph from...What makes this movie so special is the fact that even though the story is very special and certainly not the easiest to follow, it all works very well. You'll get an enormous mix of emotions and you'll see plenty of characters who in one way or another have something to do with each other, but it will all fit right into its place.

In Unfaithful, it's the wife who wanders, but the price that ultimately is paid is just as steep.Connie Sumner (Diane Lane) appears to have it all - a loving husband, a precocious son, a magnificent home in the New York City suburbs, and charity work and school projects to keep her days from becoming humdrum. During an excursion to Manhattan, on a day in which it appears tornado-force winds are threatening the city, she's knocked down and rescued by a charming book dealer, Frenchman Paul Martel (Olivier Martinez), who invites her into his Soho loft to tend to her injured knees. Despite his insinuatingly seductive ways, she departs with her morals intact, only to find herself obsessing over him in the following days. Against her better judgment, she contacts him, but guilt inhibits her from succumbing to his charms when they meet again. Not content with having avoided trouble twice, Connie returns again, and the third time surrenders to her desires, embarking on an ongoing affair that evolves from strictly physical encounters to emotional involvement.The premise of this film would have been far easier to accept had Connie been escaping from an insufferable or at least boring existence. But husband Edward is clearly attentive and romantic and - since he's played by Richard Gere - extremely attractive. He's not abusive, nor does he ignore her. After more than a decade of marriage, the two still flirt with each other like newlyweds. Connie is devoted to her son and his needs. So what exactly has drawn her into this affair? A one-shot encounter could be attributed to pure lust, but her long-term interest is difficult to understand. The couple progresses from steamy afternoons in bed to lunch in restaurants and excursions to the movies, as if they were dating with serious intentions. Given she can't confide in anyone, Connie is unable to convey to the viewer what it is that's compelling her to risk all she has. More than anything, I wanted to know why.Whatever weaknesses there are in Alvin Sargent's script are forgiven by the performances delivered by Lyne's cast. Lane is superb. On the train, heading home from yet another tryst, she wordlessly conveys her pleasure, her shame, her passion, her guilt, her every emotion playing itself out on her face in a scene that more than justifies her Oscar nomination. Gere is low-key as the cuckolded husband - even his anger is subdued - and he conveys the quiet rage simmering beneath the surface without resorting to screaming histrionics. Martinez adds dimension to his character, making him interesting enough to suggest he's more than a pretty face on the prowl.An alternate, more definitive ending was rejected in favor of the ambiguous finale we are given here, and the audience is left to decide in which direction Connie and Edward will take their marriage. What is clear is that whatever their choice, their shattered relationship will forever be haunted by her indiscretion and his reaction.

Martinez adds dimension to his character, making him interesting enough to suggest he's more than a pretty face on the prowl.An alternate, more definitive ending was rejected in favor of the ambiguous finale we are given here, and the audience is left to decide in which direction Connie and Edward will take their marriage. What is clear is that whatever their choice, their shattered relationship will forever be haunted by her indiscretion and his reaction. Like Fatal Attraction, Unfaithful serves as a loud and clear warning to all spouses tempted to stray.

But it's touching. As a child it was my favorite movie and I'd watch it every day for a period of about 3 months. It made me cry, but it meant a lot to me. It might have it's corny moments, but kids like it, and my parents liked it too. Compared to a lot of the movies kids force their parents to watch, this one isn't so bad.It's really sweet, and it puts out a good message. It allows you to feel and care about things that go on it the world. I dug this out today and watched it again and it was still pretty magical to me, although I'm much older now. I don't see why this is rated a 5.2. I guess I wouldn't tell every adult to go out and watch it, but if you have kids, or just love animals, then give this a shot. It's a good film.
