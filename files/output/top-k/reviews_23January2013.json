I had no idea what Rope was even about and as of yet I was not understanding the brilliance that is Hitchcock. Well consider Rope me finally understanding. Rope is this brilliant, twisted, bright, deceptive murder mystery unlike any other. It plays out like a stage play in a small apartment overlooking this beautiful and haunting New York skyline. There is as much going on outside those windows as there is in the apartment. The murder and subsequent dinner party is so twisting and disturbing and edgy and riveting that you won't be able to tear your eyes away from this group of people, especially the two masterminds of the crime. I'm not sure I've ever seen a film that is so obviously made for the stage or would translate so well to stage. The undertones of the film, the little quirks in the personalities of the cast is just brilliant. This is the ultimate mystery thriller with very little thrills. Its all a character study and a brilliant one at that.Our two murderers are Brandon and Phillip. Brandon is played absolutely brilliantly by John Dall. His character is so brilliant I can't even speak highly enough about her performance. This character is so likable and charismatic and yet you just watched him murder his friend in an attempt to create the perfect crime. He's a complete sociopath and you can see it in the performance. Farley Granger is also very good as the follower of the two of them. He's paranoid and nervous and clearly under the spell of Brandon's fast talking charismatic personality. He is excellent in his role and the two of them play off of each other just right. Enter the incomparable James Stewart in a role he apparently always felt he was wrong for and didn't like and go figure because I thought he absolutely nailed it. His class and charisma makes his role as the impromptu detective fun, interesting, and believable. The best scenes are between Stewart, Dall, and Granger at the dinner party. The script is simply brilliant and the dialogue is outstanding. The supporting cast members are all good but have small, yet important roles. I thought Douglas Dick and Joan Chandler were particularly good in their roles as former lovers that Brandon is trying to manipulate to go with his murder game.Rope is of course famous for only have ten takes in the entire film. Its interesting for certain but realistically the average film goer might barely notice it except to think the film is shot differently. I think the brilliance of Alfred Hitchcock's direction in Rope is in the details. The inflections in the characters, the setting and the way the apartment is laid out and the sprawling city behind them, the flashing neon at the end when Stewart confronts the two men...I could go on. The homosexual innuendos in the film is certainly heavy. I can see why people saw that and were offended by it (in the 40's). Nowadays looking at it from a more accepting frame of mind you really see the sort of ambiguous relationship they created between Brandon and Phillip. It has no bearing on the story, its only interesting being such a big undertone in a film from the 40's. Rope was brilliant and I loved every minute of it. I am more excited now to see more Hitchcock but sad because I have no more Stewart\/Hitchcock collaborations left to watch. A must see!! 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"23 January 2013","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" In a recent fascination with Jimmy Stewart I've been powering through some old classic films like never before and that includes seeing two Alfred Hitchcock films, something I have never really seen before except Psycho years ago and same with Rear Window.

Yet, to say that the film is plot-less would be as unfair as untrue another successful product of the director and producer's duo James Ivory and Ismail Merchant, the film offers another riveting slice of the British aristocratic life, this time during the inter-war, this time for a story even more enthralling because it is told from the servants' perspective, from the diary of William Stevens, the butler.As Stevens, Anthony Hopkins delivers such a solid performance, in all nuance and subtlety, that we can't doubt the man has been or could have been anything but a butler, obviously belonging to a tradition as old as the hills and whose William Stevens Sr. (Peter Vaughan) is another living remain. Stevens Jr. has been impregnated his whole life by this impeccable perfectionism, total dedication to the master, and the dilution of his own ego into work; and to a certain extent, the butler's tasks, no matter how prestigious and dignified they seem in the beginning, turn our to be ingrate as the story progresses.This unfortunate hardship is crucial though as an empathy-builder, we see Stevens with eyes of sorrow for he's incapable to demonstrate any hint of freethinking or independent personality. And the power of Hopkins is to portray a man trapped in the one-note performance requested for his job, in a poignantly three-dimensional way. In fact, the main thrills of The Remains of the Day consist of spotting the little hints betraying Mr Stevens' capability for feelings. One clue they mostly happen during the scenes involving directly or indirectly Emma Thompson, the second lead of the film.As Mrs Kenton, Emma Thompson, the smart and pretty housekeeper is educated and trained enough to see in Mr Stevens, a worthy of admiration colleague, and she's equal to him enough, in the household hierarchy, to allow herself some familiarities. Obviously fascinated by this mountain of coldness, she brings some flowers to his private room and then, something interesting happens. While he almost dismisses the flowers as 'distractions', he politely asks Mrs Kenton to display more respect toward his father, by not calling him by his Christian name. The scene can mislead by foreshadowing several clashes between the two servants, when they are only benign misunderstandings. But it does show that that there is a heart beating behind this impeccable costume and demeanor. And when this heart is about to collapse while the father is dying, Stevens continues to serve the Master's guest no matter what happens, work must go on. This is Stevens' inner conflict, whose paradox is to create a gap between him and Mrs Kenton but in the same time, allows their mutual respect and tacit attraction, to grow patiently and discreetly with the passing of time.But we know that the romance is doomed from the very beginning, the story doesn't leave much for optimism. We know, when the movie opens that Stevens still work in the same manor, that his Master Lord Darlington died, and an American Congressman, played by Christopher Reeve, bought the house. Mrs Kenton left Darlington before the outbreak of the war and got married. The flow of the film conveys an insightful parallel between the romance and the relationship with the Master. James Fox plays Lord Darlington, not a Nazi sympathizer, but an ambiguous well-mannered gentleman who 'understands' the Germans. During a memorable toast, the American Congressman, and future house owner, would call all the assembled European politicians 'amateurs', an allegation that only shocks his audience, but doesn't fool us, not even Darlington's godson (Hugh Grant). The 'amateur' speech, with the same resonance than Churchill's 'dishonour and war' line, foresees the last days of an agonizing order that exploited the guilt of WWI victory, to roll the red carpets to the Nazis. And the tragic choices of Darlington would spill over Stevens' life. Incapable of adopting one defying attitude against his own master, Stevens condemned himself to a standard of life sadly prone to unhappiness and frustration. And it's precisely the kind of life that Mrs Kenton rejected by leaving the house. And her personal tragedy is that she left the only man she truly loved. The Remains of the Day chronicles two separate stories, challenging the solemn and unflappably professionalism of Mr Stevens, and interlocking each other until leading Stevens to a dead-end. And twenty years later, Stevens maintains the same level of mystery. People ask him where he stood for regarding his Master's opinion. Invoking the call of duty, he served his Master the best he could. He deplored some uninspired choices, the most significant being the revocation of two Jewish maids. But still, Stevens embraced his master's choices without being an accomplice. A few years later, the seal of infamy marks the name of Darlington, but not Stevens', yet there's no doubt his heart carries some regrets, and maybe, his unfulfilled relationship with Mrs Kenton is a way to make up for his own guilt.To have followed Darlington or not following Mrs Kenton? Looking back on his life, Stevens would understand the value of regrets, whether it's for done or undone choices, maybe by persuading a divorced Mrs Kenton to go back to Darlington? As a character study, the film is a wonderful examination of lives made of unmade choices and 'what if' questions, as a romance, it happens to be admirably poignant and brilliant, because feelings are so intimate and real that they can hardly be expressed, let alone from a man of such a few words like Mr Stevens. And this is why the ending plays as the perfect emotional pay-off for a film so full of frustrating inhibitions, a light of hope after an eternity spent in the Master's shadow.
