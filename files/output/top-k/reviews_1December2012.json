Thankfully, these three are NOT the movie's fault; blame it on marketing and the idiocy of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, or the Oscar buffoons.#1 Kim Basinger does NOT belong on the cover, let alone half the cover. Not only did she play a small part, not only did she only play in just one of dozens of story lines, but the other actors outshined her throughout.#2 What's the deal (still on Basinger) with Kimmy winning the only acting award at the Oscars? Heck, she was the only one nominated! Sure, 1997 was tough competition for stars &#x96; eventual winner-Jack Nicholson was excellent in As Good As it Gets &#x96; but the three leads Pearce, Crowe and Spacey, not to mention Cromwell and DeVito, were all on TOP of their game. Perhaps the Oscars said Boy, we can't pick between all of these excellent performances, so why even nominate any of them. Of course, that didn't stop them from nominating both Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis in Thelma & Louise a few years back. Furthermore, she was, in fact, good, looked gorgeous and believable in her role, but she was the weakest link in a long line of excellent performances.#3 I did like Titanic. Sure. But in the 1997's best picture line up (remember, back then, they only did the top 5) consisting of As Good As it Gets, Good Will Hunting, The Full Monty, Titanic and L.A. Confidential, L.A. Confidential took the cake far and above the rest. In fact, As Good As it Gets was better than Titanic. But, they do like their grand epics&#x85;I do want to thank them, fast forwarding 13 years to this year (2010) they dissed Avatar. At least they got that right.Whew&#x85;now I can praise one of my all time favorite movies. Crowe gave his best performance in spades and layers. He'll even tell you he's not smart enough to solve his dilemmas, but still shows the depth what others say about him. Then there's the all-around master, Spacey, who added much needed humor and elegance to the film. Pearce, wow&#x85;two words Clark Kent. And it was refreshing from both his excellent portrayal, but also to see Clark Kent in an alternative role.In addition to those fantastic performances, Cromwell and DeVito also were near perfect. Also, you have a great score, mood is fantastic, cinematography was suburb &#x96; watch it in Bluray if you can, it's gorgeous and it contains one of the most complex and wonderful scripts I have even seen on screen. I've been told they even toned it down from even more multistory-lines from its source material, its novel. Honestly, there's so much in this movie, I don't know if I could even take any more inter-webbed , overlapping subplots.In fact, it would be hard to even give a synopsis as I normally do, but I'll try.Picture it, 1950s L.A. &#x96; a place people want to come to escape or be noticed, get rich or die trying or to sleep with real movie stars or fake ones. The story begins with the semi-narrator, gossip-columnist, Sid Hudgens (DeVito) who pays for his stories&#x85;wait, I let's start over.(This paragraph might contain some heavy spoilers, skip over if you haven't seen the movie.) There are at least 8 main leads, all intersecting one way or another, leading this way, that way, and let me make one thing clear I challenge anyone who has never seen this, read any of the spoilers or the book to predict where any of the multilayered stories are headed. There are the cops Suave Jack (Spacey,) Meathead Bud (Crowe,) Clark Kent Ed (Pearce,) Do-No-Right Dudley (Cromwell) and D.A., or dick-n-ass, Ellis (Rifkin.) Then there's Loose Lynn (Basinger,) Vicious(-tongued) Sid (DeVito) and Pimpin' Pierce (Strathairn.) There's actually more, but these are the eight leads. Eight!As much as I loved the (remake) Ocean's Eleven, where they also had a magnitude of characters, all with their individual backgrounds and depth, this movie handled it better. Ocean's had more than 10 characters, duh, but in reality, they focused on the main three actors Clooney, Pitt and Damon. Here, everyone gets their own screen time, each have incredible depth and range thanks to the actors involved and each have their back stories along with actual growth.To really make the movie basic or dumbed down for one central synopsis, it boils down to go-getter Ed who's made responsible for solving a multi-slaying homicide, but he doesn't think that the outcome is true justice. Honestly, I think that's the one line that's constant as there are at least 5-6 more supposedly irrelevant plots hanging around.When you begin to watch L.A. Confidential for the first time (or in my case, the fifth or so) it just seems a little complicated at times. Even I have a little hard time following each thread, even when I rewatch it again. And that's one of the beauties of this movie each experience is brand new. And even if you get the movie as a whole, the next time you watch it, you can sit back and focus on the crisp scenery, the richness of 1950s Los Angeles or the delicious performances.

The fourth Bond film overall, and the third of the EON series! Dr. No and From Russia With Love introduced us to Bond and reinvented cinema as we know it like never before! We had so many people to thank for these two movies. One of them was Terence Young. He directed Bond not only with dedication and professionalism, but with style and seriousness! Could any other Bond director give us the same virtues? Fortunately, the answer was yes. After Young departed from the Bond series, the search for a new director was cast. Guy Hamilton eventually got the gig, and were to direct Goldfinger which was the sixth novel of Ian Fleming's books! Hamilton had some good movies behind him, but could he take on the job as a Bond director? As said before, yes he could!Goldfinger grossed a lot of money with over 120 million dollars. Almost all critics gave it an overwhelming good response, and was looked as at the movie which changed the cinema forever! It was also the first Bond movie to win an Oscar (it won for best effects, sound effects). Goldfinger is one of the most beloved, probably THE most beloved of the entire series... and for a good reason! As many reviewers before me has said, this movie just has everything an evil villain, a cool henchman, lots of humor, lots of action, beautiful women and some of the best gadgets Q has to offer! I really can't decide which Bond film is my favorite From Russia With Love or Goldfinger. From Russia With Love is probably a better film overall, but Goldfinger is probably a better Bond film. Anyway, this movie is so fantastic, that you'll do yourself a favor if you choose to watch it! While Connery's first two Bond movies were very serious, one word continues to describe Goldfinger entertainment! And I think that's more important in a Bond movie! Plus, this movie has my favorite climax of all the Bond films!This time Bond is sent out to investigate a possible gold smuggler named Auric Goldfinger. At first, Bond is just meant to investigate and follow him, but Bond is once again is lured into a plot that could change the world's economy for many years! Doesn't exactly benefits Bond that Goldfinger has an indestructible henchman called Oddjob, who can kill a person with his bowler hat! There's no SPECTRE or SMERSH, just a bastard named Goldfinger who loves gold and hates losing. I think it fits the story, to be a stand alone film. The story is like the previous Bond films, so well told so the movie never drags. There are tons of action and beautiful women, and Bond utters arguably the best Bond line ever which is Shocking... positively shocking. It's so different than the others, but in a way it's also more entertaining. It's the best BOND movie ever made!Sean Connery marks his third appearance as James Bond, and he is enjoying himself here! Connery is still as charming and smooth as before, and he slightly more Bond in Goldfinger, as we've come to known him! Gert Fröbe is Auric Goldfinger, as the villain of the piece. He's fantastic! He's not physically imposing, but he's such an interesting character, as his villainous nature later reveals. He has my favorite scheme for a Bond villain ever, and he is given many good lines (you know which i'm talking about). Goldfinger is arguably the best Bond villain in the entire series! Honor Blackman is Pussy Galore, and she is also very good. Her character is hinted at being lesbian (as she is in the novel) which is something we don't usually see from a Bond girl. She'd be my nr. 4 on my top 10 Bond girls. Harold Tosh Togo Sakata is just plain awesome as Oddjob! He doesn't talk but he doesn't need to. Just looking at him you'll know that he is a baddie! That thing with his throwing hat, has just been parodied so much over the years! Shaw is still my favorite Bond henchman, but Oddjob is still a close nr. 2! We also have the second Felix Leiter actor, Cec Linder. I like his performance, but as the first actor since Jack Lord to portray the character, he is kind of a let down! Lord's performance as Leiter was the definitive one! Desmond Llewelyn marks his second appearance as Q, and his briefing has never been better than it is in Goldfinger! Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell is brought back as M and Moneypenny, and you know they're good. All in all, this is a Bond movie that a Bond fan is not allowed to miss! It's just unacceptable if that could happen! Goldfinger sat the standards for all coming Bond villains to come, and changed the cinema forever. However, this also marked the point where Bond movies would try to top each other every single time. I'm not saying Goldfinger is a part of the ordeal, as it was the movie who started it all, but you can't get around the fact that the movie is a bit silly. Oddjob's hat, all the lasers, the car gadgets, etc. But I know it's a Bond movie, and without Goldfinger, we probably wouldn't know Bond as we know him today! Goldfinger is the perfect amount of silly, and the plot is still very well done! And it's all damn good entertainment! I'm gonna go ahead and call it my pic for the best Bond film ever made! This movie is Goldfinger... and it's absolutely friggin' awesome!10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 December 2012","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" It's Goldfinger! The fourth Bond film overall, and the third of the EON series! Dr. No and From Russia With Love introduced us to Bond and reinvented cinema as we know it like never before! We had so many people to thank for these two movies. One of them was Terence Young. He directed Bond not only with dedication and professionalism, but with style and seriousness! Could any other Bond director give us the same virtues? Fortunately, the answer was yes. After Young departed from the Bond series, the search for a new director was cast. Guy Hamilton eventually got the gig, and were to direct Goldfinger which was the sixth novel of Ian Fleming's books! Hamilton had some good movies behind him, but could he take on the job as a Bond director? As said before, yes he could!Goldfinger grossed a lot of money with over 120 million dollars. Almost all critics gave it an overwhelming good response, and was looked as at the movie which changed the cinema forever! It was also the first Bond movie to win an Oscar (it won for best effects, sound effects). Goldfinger is one of the most beloved, probably THE most beloved of the entire series... and for a good reason! As many reviewers before me has said, this movie just has everything an evil villain, a cool henchman, lots of humor, lots of action, beautiful women and some of the best gadgets Q has to offer! I really can't decide which Bond film is my favorite From Russia With Love or Goldfinger. From Russia With Love is probably a better film overall, but Goldfinger is probably a better Bond film. Anyway, this movie is so fantastic, that you'll do yourself a favor if you choose to watch it! While Connery's first two Bond movies were very serious, one word continues to describe Goldfinger entertainment! And I think that's more important in a Bond movie! Plus, this movie has my favorite climax of all the Bond films!This time Bond is sent out to investigate a possible gold smuggler named Auric Goldfinger. At first, Bond is just meant to investigate and follow him, but Bond is once again is lured into a plot that could change the world's economy for many years! Doesn't exactly benefits Bond that Goldfinger has an indestructible henchman called Oddjob, who can kill a person with his bowler hat! There's no SPECTRE or SMERSH, just a bastard named Goldfinger who loves gold and hates losing. I think it fits the story, to be a stand alone film. The story is like the previous Bond films, so well told so the movie never drags. There are tons of action and beautiful women, and Bond utters arguably the best Bond line ever which is Shocking... positively shocking. It's so different than the others, but in a way it's also more entertaining. It's the best BOND movie ever made!Sean Connery marks his third appearance as James Bond, and he is enjoying himself here! Connery is still as charming and smooth as before, and he slightly more Bond in Goldfinger, as we've come to known him! Gert Fröbe is Auric Goldfinger, as the villain of the piece. He's fantastic! He's not physically imposing, but he's such an interesting character, as his villainous nature later reveals. He has my favorite scheme for a Bond villain ever, and he is given many good lines (you know which i'm talking about). Goldfinger is arguably the best Bond villain in the entire series! Honor Blackman is Pussy Galore, and she is also very good. Her character is hinted at being lesbian (as she is in the novel) which is something we don't usually see from a Bond girl. She'd be my nr. 4 on my top 10 Bond girls. Harold Tosh Togo Sakata is just plain awesome as Oddjob! He doesn't talk but he doesn't need to. Just looking at him you'll know that he is a baddie! That thing with his throwing hat, has just been parodied so much over the years! Shaw is still my favorite Bond henchman, but Oddjob is still a close nr. 2! We also have the second Felix Leiter actor, Cec Linder. I like his performance, but as the first actor since Jack Lord to portray the character, he is kind of a let down! Lord's performance as Leiter was the definitive one! Desmond Llewelyn marks his second appearance as Q, and his briefing has never been better than it is in Goldfinger! Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell is brought back as M and Moneypenny, and you know they're good. All in all, this is a Bond movie that a Bond fan is not allowed to miss! It's just unacceptable if that could happen! Goldfinger sat the standards for all coming Bond villains to come, and changed the cinema forever. However, this also marked the point where Bond movies would try to top each other every single time. I'm not saying Goldfinger is a part of the ordeal, as it was the movie who started it all, but you can't get around the fact that the movie is a bit silly. Oddjob's hat, all the lasers, the car gadgets, etc. But I know it's a Bond movie, and without Goldfinger, we probably wouldn't know Bond as we know him today! Goldfinger is the perfect amount of silly, and the plot is still very well done! And it's all damn good entertainment! I'm gonna go ahead and call it my pic for the best Bond film ever made!

Flashback some 30 years to the mid 1960's when Reynolds got the chance to play another leading role in a Meredith Willson show, and a real-life woman of legend. It has been 100 years since the Titanic sank and the real life Molly Brown assisted panicky passengers on the lifeboats. While the stories vary to her involvement, the legend has not died. The 1960 Broadway show was a critically mixed musical that had a respectful run. After The Music Man was a smash movie, MGM set their sights on Molly Brown, and cast their peppiest star of the 1950's in the role for which she is now most famous for. The result An Oscar Nominated performance that many viewers claim the prize should have been hers.Baby Molly is first seen floating down the Colorado River, having survived a flood, and when next seen, she is a rambunctious teenager boasting I Ain't Down Yet! to her bullying cousins who tease her about her desire to leave their mountain home for the beautiful people of Denver. Leaving her loving grandfather (Ed Begley Sr.), Reynolds briefly works in a saloon, but her efforts to get to Denver are delayed when she falls in love with and marries Johnny Brown (Harve Presnell), a miner searching for gold. When they strike it rich, Molly and Johnny end up in Denver, but find that society, lead by the snooty Mrs. McGraw (stage veteran Audrey Christie) isn't going to cater to riffraff like her, no matter how many millions they are worth. So to show the stuffy society up, they go off to Europe and bag themselves a royal flush, come back, throw an outrageous party, then fight, separate, and long for each other in spite of their problems. It is when Molly returns home that she finds herself aboard the Titanic, grabbing herself a piece of history and proving herself truly unsinkable.This is a movie musical that works better on screen than on stage with its colorful Colorado mountain setting. I saw Reynolds and Presnell in a touring production of the show in 1988 and noticed a difference between the two, mostly based upon a book that while entertaining needed much tweaking. Reynolds and Presnell are supported by a wonderful supporting cast which also includes Hermoine Baddley as Mrs. McGraw's brassy mother who puts her daughter down a peg or two, and the delightfully imperious Martita Hunt (Great Expectation's Miss Haversham) as the Duchess who also adds her two cents to Mrs. McGraw for previously snubbing Molly. Do you play, Mrs. McGraw?, she asks her after Molly promises to entertain them on the piano, obviously having set this up. No, sorry. Pity, she replies dryly as if dismissing a naughty servant.But this is Reynolds' show, and I personally feel that she deserved the Oscar this year. No other performer (maybe Judy Garland) could make you laugh and cry, yet sing, dance, be funny and serious, like Debbie Reynolds. She is outrageous in the dancing sequences, whether bellying up to the bar, or doing the high kicks of He's My Friend, a wonderful new production added for the movie. Fortunately, she got to do this as well in the touring production, as well as sing the songs cut from the movie. (My Own Brass Bed is particularly memorable, but didn't make it into the film.) Presnell is a handsome leading man with a wonderful singing voice, but when I saw this on the big screen, I found his tendency to cross his eyes a bit distracting. This probably cut his leading man career down, but as a character actor (most memorably the father-in-law in Fargo) he would find roles more suitable. Reynolds and Presnell have a wonderful duet, I'll Never Say No, and Presnell has several fine solos as well, showing off his manly physique while building a home for Molly.Rumors have had Molly Brown as a possible contender for a Broadway revival with a tweaked book. I hope this is true, because Willson's songs, the magnificent choreography and the tale of a feisty heroine are the stuff that legends are made of.

To top this all off, it's suspenseful. The entire last half is edge of your seat.Despite being indirectly named after Peter Lorre's character, he isn't directly prevalent in the film, but his presence is always in the air.

The entire police force is worn down, combing the city for one man. It even interrupts the criminals. So they decide to hunt this monster too, but at the same time while remaining separate from the police, who on any other day are their enemies. This is the dynamic of M, and the stubbornness leads to tension. The first half is informative, organic, but slowly paced. There were many opportunities to advance the plot that weren't taken. But once the ball gets rolling... it stays rolling, and right to the end you're right in the film. Lang makes interesting artistic choices, like the use of silence in suspenseful scenes. Seeing a man run completely scared but without even the noise of his shoes hitting the ground is harrowing. Mirrors also have interesting applications too.

This movie lacks that subtlety, trying to do both a social satire and a homosexual parody at the same time. A good satire can most often be watched as a good parody as well if you don't concentrate on the hidden commentary. But intentional parody doesn't really work as a satire and it's a form of humour that you either love or hate. I belong to the latter group, and thus I don't really think that I belong to this film's target audience. It's too bright, too in your face, too exuberantly and stereotypically gay - and not in a fun way. You're painfully reminded that these people, especially the males, could never exists in real life. They're just too over the top, too stereotypical, too clueless about even the most basic of social norms.By far the worst is the rehabilitation center, though, which is painted in the most obnoxious shades of pink and baby blue. The whole process of trying to turn gays and lesbians into straight people by forcing them to adapt the most masculine and feminine roles imaginable is of course ludicrous, though from what I've gathered, not that far from reality, unfortunately. And I think that this over the topness will actually please the friends of parody as it is always treated with tongue in cheek and with certain amount of yeah, we're just kidding. But every now and then the movie takes a turn for the worse and tries to point and mock through the use of satire. It tries to say this is wrong, don't do this, but it feels like it's trying to force the message down our throats. Its message is a good one, don't get me wrong, but its delivery leaves much to be desired.That being said, there are some good things in this film. The acting is mainly rather bland, but the two main characters, Megan (Natasha Lyonne) and Graham (Clea DuVall), have some genuine chemistry between them and you're able to buy their romance. Add in some laughs, which are kind of forced, but laughs nonetheless, and you have a film that has some value as a guilty pleasure.And that pretty nicely sums up the film. It's not a good movie. It simultaneously mocks the gay people and then tries to tell its audience that it's okay to be one, which sends extremely mixed messages. But it is rather funny if its sense of humour tickles your fancy and the main romance is watchable. There are worse films in existence.

At least that's what people said when Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery came out on video. I know I did.Unfortunately, I didn't catch the original Austin Powers when it hit theatres and caught wind of it on video, much like the audience did for The Terminator. Thank God for video (or DVD, or HD, or Bluray) or treasures like those two movies may never had expanded to sequels. And even, to date, there's only two sequels for Austin Powers, I simply can't wait for a part four.We're introduced to the swingin' Austin Powers in the 1960's as he battles his nemesis Dr. Evil. The bad doctor escapes, well, somewhat, in a freezing chamber (the legendary Bob's Big Boy mascot) and Austin follows suit. Both are defrosted in 1997 where Austin has to adjust, hilariously, to today's times while, again, battling the sinister Dr. Evil. Mostly in Las Vegas.I didn't grow up on the James Bond movies, and I admit it wasn't until a few years ago someone I was dating encouraged me to rent one of the original Sean Connery Bond films. Honestly, I don't recall which one (It might have been You Only Live Twice) but I seriously began laughing out loud at Blofeld, having seen Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery so many times before. Needless to say, this upset my partner as Blofeld and his pet were supposed to be taken seriously. I just never saw the movie Austin Powers spoofed before.And that's how good this comedy is. You don't even need to see the source material, though it helps. Airplane! is another that cracks me up every time I watch it, even though I never saw any of the Airport movies.This movie grabs you from the opening street dance segment, to the cultural references, to Austin's adjustment to the last part of the century and it doesn't stop there. He's pulling double-duty also playing the infamous Dr. Evil (or Blofeld) who's actually probably funnier. Enter in a wonderful Hurley, Sterling and Green (which looked very green he was so young here) and you have the perfect casting.Years after this release (1997) and I am still rolling every time I see Austin's over-the-top slapstick and sight-gags. See the steamroller accident. It's still great to quote this movie and it should be viewed by all that love intelligent spoof movies. Granted, there aren't a lot of them (Airplane!, Scary Movie, Naked Gun, Top Secret and this one are the only ones that come to mind,) but still I highly recommend this and I refuse to give away a lot of the joys in this review they show you throughout.

Dante's Peak really fits the bill. Perfect? By all means, no, and I don't think Brosnan, Hamilton or Director Donaldson would disagree. They all set out to show a film of heart, with a backdrop of a natural disaster, in this case, an erupting volcano. Sure, it's not original; Dante's Peak solely takes from Twister and even Jaws. And it seems like, similar to Jurassic Park, they had the technology, why not create a definite volcano disaster flick. Giving the Brosnan volcanologist a bit of a background, he loses his girl in a separate volcano incident four years prior. And now he may be jumping the gun in the quiet, 2nd best town of Dante's Peak by saying their sleepy volcano's about to blow. Obviously, the story (and events that follow) is predictable, but that's the fun in going into a film like this. The first half of the film is filmed with gorgeous mountain scenes and a great looking town. The second half is what people bought tickets (or rented) for a roller coaster of action, suspense and touching moments, though mostly forced. Hamilton and Brosnan save the movie with their believable, though clichéd and predictable characters. And some scenes, you'll just have to suspend that disbelief seriously, not only is he going to attempt to drive over lava, but put everyone else and the leaping dog at risk?

Freddy is kind of a slacker compared to Michael Myers or Jason Vorhees. The film does have some great moments from Wes Craven, who does know how to frame a shot to make it scary.

That's why I think The Matrix is not a philosophical piece of cinema but rather an allegorical one. Also, What Morpheus did was not a religious act, even if he hadn't known it yet. Yes, there is a fate that is to be destroyed. But that fate comes from AI. When you are no longer born but rather genetically engineered and grown by elaborate machines, and you live your entire life in a simulation whose rules are built by the needs of AI, this is no longer a fate that we used to phrase in everyday life; this is a fate that is built and controlled by the physical authority. That's why a program called the oracle has the calculation power to predict the future of Matrix and the individuals connected to it. The connection between humans and AI fortunately brings a hopeful way out for the humans namely an anomaly or Neo. Somehow a human called Neo has the power to control The Matrix. I interpret this as an error caused during the growing process or the lifetime spent in Matrix which resulted from a special code that is written to his DNA or in the other case to his mind.For me, entire film is about accepting the possibility of lack of free will and the relentless war to restore it.After all;What is the Matrix?- Control.
