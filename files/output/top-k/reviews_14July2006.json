Such an overload of clichés is not easy to find. I have an urge to say the acting stinks too, and although it is absolutely true, the actors are totally excused, simply because there's nothing to act on. You simply cannot utter sentences and act out story bits seen and heard so many times and have an expression, apart from cartoon-like mimic and eye-brow work. EVERYTHING was so bad here, from direction to acting to perhaps-good-but-totally-misplaced score to camera, i just had to comment aloud all the time, although i was home alone! I don't do that usually; it was really that bad. Occasionally, computer graphics would appear which, to my surprise, looked exceptionally good (although very kitchy). This made me think how the hell a director and a story this crappy got so much money for CGI??.When after the film i read that this is a Brian De Palma movie, i was shocked. Something MUST have gone terribly wrong in the production of this. A badly timed deadline? Urgent need of money? I don't know. And i don't want to know. I want to forget this, as soon as i write this review.Now, as a youngster i was a great fan of sci-fi literature, and even today i like to see a good SF movie; alas, by now i already realized there is almost no such thing; with very rare exceptions.

But, contrary to most of them, i don't think that making aliens nice and wise makes it a good film, or even story. _Sh*t_stinks_, whatever shade of brown it may be. Not to forget shameless ripping off also stinks, especially when it is so obvious, as this rip-off of 2001 Space Odissey is; and even more so when the rip-off is such a simplistic version of the original. As i watched, i kept thinking When this guy (i.e. director) was young, he wished he made 2001 SO. Eventually he did, and he screwed it up to last bit, and he called it Mission to Mars.

Of course, that's not a shock considering you have Woody Harrelson, Randy Quaid and Bill Murray starring. Now there's a stable, conservative trio!! This actually has some very funny moments. At first I was afraid it was going to be too irreverent to the Amish - and there definitely was some of that with Quaid's character, who is made to look like a total dimwit, who has no knowledge of the Bible and is easily led - NO characteristics of an Amish person, BUT the film really isn't mean-spirited and it does show respect for the Amish in a number of scenes. However, it's still very much a sleazy film and the writers wouldn't have done this with any other non-Christian character.All the characters in here, including the profane female lead played by Vanessa Angel (who?), are fun to watch. The most outrageous, in a minor role, is the female landlord who has to be seen to be believed.Bowlers will especially like this film since a good part of it centers around that. A number of PBA members put it cameo performances. One scene, with the fake hand attached to the bowling ball as it returns from the ball rack had me almost in tears laughing, for some reason. Murray's take on the flamboyant bowler (and there have been a few over the years on the Pro Bowlers Tour) is hilarious.Crude, but a funny film for the most part.

Well, yeah, I suppose. Or the location shots which are honest but oddly out of place.What gives me a thrill is how well assembled this was from the editor's point of view. These were days when the job was really nasty work, huge rooms, hanging films, tedious looping and physical taping. It was an unappreciated creative task, and because the studio system had restrictive philosophies in how it was done, it was essentially a task for clerks.The editor in Hollywood wouldn't be appreciated until the late sixties when Easy Rider spawned the independent movement. Here's a tremendous example of the value of the editor.In this case its Margaret Booth, who sorta followed a secretarial path to head the editing department at the studio, then the center of film-making for the world, moneywise. For the most part she followed the rules. But here for some reason she did something quite different than usual.Consider. The challenges of this story are significant. There's a long, very long first segment of the voyage out where we are shown the reason for the complaints. Because the nature of shipyard life and the complications of the conflict are pretty complex, this cannot be shorter.Then there's a segment in Tahiti where some love happens. This is as short as possible, but because it has to balance the weight of confinement and at the same time justify (for us) the location shooting, its still long.Then a segment of the mutiny itself. Then the longish voyage of Bligh. The chase, the escape, the trail, the coda. Now that's an awful lot. Too much by double, even compared to Gone with the Wind.I'd like to direct your attention to Gladiator, and Ridley Scott's technique of shaping each scene so that it is open at the end, not closed. Its open in a way that anticipates the next. In a regular movie, each scene is dispensed as a discrete, readable segment that opens and closes. It is the job of the story and associated elements to keep us engaged. In Gladiator, the story is too diffuse, so Scott shapes the scenes (and Crowe) so that each scene has its center of gravity in the next. We tip into the future. Its a joy to watch even if the thing itself is a bit inelegant.Watch that, then see what Maggie has done here, apparently without the help or even knowledge of the directors.

Compare this to Master and Commander, in which the ship existed only as an assembly of parts which we knew would noisily disassemble.I suppose may would celebrate the performances. Well, yeah, I suppose. Or the location shots which are honest but oddly out of place.What gives me a thrill is how well assembled this was from the editor's point of view. These were days when the job was really nasty work, huge rooms, hanging films, tedious looping and physical taping. It was an unappreciated creative task, and because the studio system had restrictive philosophies in how it was done, it was essentially a task for clerks.The editor in Hollywood wouldn't be appreciated until the late sixties when Easy Rider spawned the independent movement. Here's a tremendous example of the value of the editor.In this case its Margaret Booth, who sorta followed a secretarial path to head the editing department at the studio, then the center of film-making for the world, moneywise. For the most part she followed the rules. But here for some reason she did something quite different than usual.Consider. The challenges of this story are significant. There's a long, very long first segment of the voyage out where we are shown the reason for the complaints. Because the nature of shipyard life and the complications of the conflict are pretty complex, this cannot be shorter.Then there's a segment in Tahiti where some love happens. This is as short as possible, but because it has to balance the weight of confinement and at the same time justify (for us) the location shooting, its still long.Then a segment of the mutiny itself. Then the longish voyage of Bligh. The chase, the escape, the trail, the coda. Now that's an awful lot. Too much by double, even compared to Gone with the Wind.I'd like to direct your attention to Gladiator, and Ridley Scott's technique of shaping each scene so that it is open at the end, not closed. Its open in a way that anticipates the next. In a regular movie, each scene is dispensed as a discrete, readable segment that opens and closes. It is the job of the story and associated elements to keep us engaged. In Gladiator, the story is too diffuse, so Scott shapes the scenes (and Crowe) so that each scene has its center of gravity in the next. We tip into the future. Its a joy to watch even if the thing itself is a bit inelegant.Watch that, then see what Maggie has done here, apparently without the help or even knowledge of the directors. She's assembled the footage in a way that's open at the end, anticipatory. It isn't &#151; alas &#151; a simple matter of cutting scenes short, or overlapping sound (which would come later). Its a matter of tuning into the very subtle rhythms of a setup, then ending it at a midbeat. Without the patterning of jazz from the period, we wouldn't have been able to read the subliminal syncopation.But here it is, as a sort of micromutiny. Thanks, Ms Booth.Oh, the story?

Like the proverbial onion, AI is multi-layered; unlike the humor mag by that name, we're more apt to cry than laugh as the layers reveal themselves. There are tears of remorse, and of recognition, at the profound insights on human nature, history and destiny enfolded here ... and tears of awe, at the final layer of irony that only recent history could supply. There's far too much to even attempt addressing it all here. AI echoes Biblical themes of original sin and expulsion from Eden; of Cain and Abel, of immaculate cybernetic conception, of Pinocchio and the Blue Fairy, entwined in riddles about the inscrutability of such fundamental human mysteries as body and soul, hedonism and martyrdom, nature, creation and the hereafter, and the enigmas of human love and altruism. AI also resonates with the tragedies of the century just past &#150; the Holocaust and the H-Bomb - and the century just barely begun at the time of its release &#150; 9\/11, climate change, and Hurricane Katrina. As Jews were stigmatized as less than human, and thus, fit for Nazi extermination, for their failure to conform to the prevailing mythology of Christian ensoulment, electronic beings who - like Shylock's Jew - have the capacity to express and register compassion and pain, are deemed lesser beings, fit for brutalization and disposal by a human community itself too threatened with self-inflicted extinction to recall existential pride and joy, except through the abasement and subjugation of others. ... A book would be needed to treat all these facets fairly. Yet, AI's most profound impact seems to arise out of its unwitting foreshadowing, first of global climate change, and then, of the violence and paranoia ushered in with 9\/11\/01, by both sides in the war on terror, only weeks after AI hit the screens. Who can help but lose one's breath or skip a beat, at the image of World Trade Towers, first rising above a flooded Manhattan skyline, as David and Joe approach in their amphibicopter - and again, after millennia bring a new ice age, the image of the doomed towers piercing the glacier's face! Were these images not painful and prophetic enough, before the towers fell? What can it all possibly mean? Briefly put, the message AI drives home most forcefully for me, is one about the meaning of human love, in the context of parents and children, dead, living and yet unborn &#150; of love against the backdrop of generational change, and intergenerational memory. After we're treated to the folly of Joe, a robot, playing out the superficial mechanics of romantic love, we glimpse the concept of higher love in David's capacity to be imprinted with an immutable devotion to his mother. And we're led to believe that Monica, his human mother, exemplifies a higher form of human love, by favoring her own flesh-and-blood offspring, Martin, to the robo-boy, David, when the two come into conflict. But Joe later hints at the shallowness of this human motherly love, when he speaks outside Dr. Know's pavilion, about even the love of a human mother, being more about what the child does for the parent, than about a true devotion to the happiness and welfare of the child. Remember, even as the film begins, the context is established that mankind has permitted its living children, and all future generations of humankind, to be afflicted with man-made climate change that has already flooded the flower of humanity's historical pride and glory, and the great coastal concentrations of its cultural memory &#150; not to mention, the death by drowning of millions of flesh-and-blood children, other people's children. If we cannot care enough to save these millions of fellow-humans now alive, how can we claim to have the love to protect the memories of generations past, and the dreams of generations of children to come, from man-made destruction of creation on earth? Spielberg and Kubrick appear to be saying that we true humans of flesh, blood and bone, cannot make any legitimate claim for the superiority of our species &#150; of our unique minds and souls &#150; if we could not muster the human feeling and caring to prevent the work of generations of our ancestors, or the hopes and dreams of our potential future flesh and blood descendants, from being wiped out through man-made climate change. In a similar vein, through the image of the robot David, chasing after the illusion of the Blue Fairy, the film-makers also seem to criticize, with subtle but stunning effect, the pre-occupation of humans &#150; whether of Christian or other faiths &#150; with their access to a mythical afterlife of the individual soul, when the likely effect of this pre-occupation is to ensure that living generations will be insufficiently attentive to the steps required of us, if we are to preserve any future humans to perpetuate those faith traditions &#150; much less to live their own lives. The irony of watching future generations of evolved androids, showing more concern for the preservation of our human qualities and memories, than we had apparently shown for our own, was simply staggering. And the prospect that those qualities and memories might be embodied someday only in beings of silicon and microchips, should be motivation enough for us to rediscover the genuine love we have for our own flesh-and-blood children, and their hopes and dreams, and for us to take the lessons of more recent events &#150; like Hurricane Katrina &#150; and more recent films &#150; like An Inconvenient Truth &#150; truly to heart, so that we may join with like-minded humans, and avert the realization of the direst prophesies portrayed in AI. Unless humans can muster the sense to preserve our species and the Creation of which we're a part, then perhaps, Spielberg and Kubrick hint, it's our own alleged human intelligence - more than the androids' - that should be deemed artificial!

Like the proverbial onion, AI is multi-layered; unlike the humor mag by that name, we're more apt to cry than laugh as the layers reveal themselves. There are tears of remorse, and of recognition, at the profound insights on human nature, history and destiny enfolded here ... and tears of awe, at the final layer of irony that only recent history could supply. There's far too much to even attempt addressing it all here. AI echoes Biblical themes of original sin and expulsion from Eden; of Cain and Abel, of immaculate cybernetic conception, of Pinocchio and the Blue Fairy, entwined in riddles about the inscrutability of such fundamental human mysteries as body and soul, hedonism and martyrdom, nature, creation and the hereafter, and the enigmas of human love and altruism. AI also resonates with the tragedies of the century just past &#150; the Holocaust and the H-Bomb - and the century just barely begun at the time of its release &#150; 9\/11, climate change, and Hurricane Katrina. As Jews were stigmatized as less than human, and thus, fit for Nazi extermination, for their failure to conform to the prevailing mythology of Christian ensoulment, electronic beings who - like Shylock's Jew - have the capacity to express and register compassion and pain, are deemed lesser beings, fit for brutalization and disposal by a human community itself too threatened with self-inflicted extinction to recall existential pride and joy, except through the abasement and subjugation of others. ... A book would be needed to treat all these facets fairly. Yet, AI's most profound impact seems to arise out of its unwitting foreshadowing, first of global climate change, and then, of the violence and paranoia ushered in with 9\/11\/01, by both sides in the war on terror, only weeks after AI hit the screens. Who can help but lose one's breath or skip a beat, at the image of World Trade Towers, first rising above a flooded Manhattan skyline, as David and Joe approach in their amphibicopter - and again, after millennia bring a new ice age, the image of the doomed towers piercing the glacier's face! Were these images not painful and prophetic enough, before the towers fell? What can it all possibly mean? Briefly put, the message AI drives home most forcefully for me, is one about the meaning of human love, in the context of parents and children, dead, living and yet unborn &#150; of love against the backdrop of generational change, and intergenerational memory. After we're treated to the folly of Joe, a robot, playing out the superficial mechanics of romantic love, we glimpse the concept of higher love in David's capacity to be imprinted with an immutable devotion to his mother. And we're led to believe that Monica, his human mother, exemplifies a higher form of human love, by favoring her own flesh-and-blood offspring, Martin, to the robo-boy, David, when the two come into conflict. But Joe later hints at the shallowness of this human motherly love, when he speaks outside Dr. Know's pavilion, about even the love of a human mother, being more about what the child does for the parent, than about a true devotion to the happiness and welfare of the child. Remember, even as the film begins, the context is established that mankind has permitted its living children, and all future generations of humankind, to be afflicted with man-made climate change that has already flooded the flower of humanity's historical pride and glory, and the great coastal concentrations of its cultural memory &#150; not to mention, the death by drowning of millions of flesh-and-blood children, other people's children. If we cannot care enough to save these millions of fellow-humans now alive, how can we claim to have the love to protect the memories of generations past, and the dreams of generations of children to come, from man-made destruction of creation on earth? Spielberg and Kubrick appear to be saying that we true humans of flesh, blood and bone, cannot make any legitimate claim for the superiority of our species &#150; of our unique minds and souls &#150; if we could not muster the human feeling and caring to prevent the work of generations of our ancestors, or the hopes and dreams of our potential future flesh and blood descendants, from being wiped out through man-made climate change. In a similar vein, through the image of the robot David, chasing after the illusion of the Blue Fairy, the film-makers also seem to criticize, with subtle but stunning effect, the pre-occupation of humans &#150; whether of Christian or other faiths &#150; with their access to a mythical afterlife of the individual soul, when the likely effect of this pre-occupation is to ensure that living generations will be insufficiently attentive to the steps required of us, if we are to preserve any future humans to perpetuate those faith traditions &#150; much less to live their own lives. The irony of watching future generations of evolved androids, showing more concern for the preservation of our human qualities and memories, than we had apparently shown for our own, was simply staggering. And the prospect that those qualities and memories might be embodied someday only in beings of silicon and microchips, should be motivation enough for us to rediscover the genuine love we have for our own flesh-and-blood children, and their hopes and dreams, and for us to take the lessons of more recent events &#150; like Hurricane Katrina &#150; and more recent films &#150; like An Inconvenient Truth &#150; truly to heart, so that we may join with like-minded humans, and avert the realization of the direst prophesies portrayed in AI.
