Along the way, he makes friends with two kids, and saves one of them from drowning! Gordy becomes famous for his actions of heroism, and becomes the CEO of a business!

His henchman are told to kidnap him, tie him in a sack, and toss him in the river! But with the help of his new friends, they all figure out where his family's been taken to (a slaughterhouse in Omaha). They go there and successfully shut the sinister slaughterhouse down once and for all! And in the end, Gordy and his friends and family all get to live together on the farm forever! This seems to be a love-it or hate-it type movie. But I loved it! A sweet story, cute characters, and a precious piglet! This is the most underrated movie ever! It's beautiful and proves that no matter how small you may be, you can always make a difference! And it's NOT a rip-off of Babe. They are just as good and just happen to share some similarities.UPDATE ON September 17 Actually, Spider's Web A Pig's Tale is not a hobo's version of Gordy. It is an in name only mockbuster of Charlotte's Web which just so happened to be released three weeks and three days before the live-action version came out. So, what did they do? That's right, they copied the original animated masterpiece from 1973. Very loosely that is. Hence it's an in name only mockbuster. Also, I never knew South Park ripped off Gordy. And I already hate that show just like you do, for pretty much the same reasons. Look at my list entitled The most overrated shows and movies ever and you'll see my reasons why. And as far as I'm concerned, the real reason Gordy's a great gem of a movie is not because it's funny (although that contributes). No, the real reason it's wonderful is because of its heartwarming story (which is NOT charmless, it's adorable), its lovable characters (come on, you know Gordy's adorable), its wonderful moral messages (I've already touched on this in this review and the one on my other account), and it's just plain entertaining, wholesome family fun. I know a lot of people say it's too dark with the slaughterhouse, but what about Bambi? Or The Lion King? They both feature the death of the most important parent (in Bambi it's the mother, in Lion King it's Simba's father Mufasa). At least Gordy's parents don't die. This is actually one of the few Disney movies where the parents live. Which makes it a lot like Sleeping Beauty, Peter Pan, Tangled, and Mulan. Also, Sleeping Beauty was dark too. And then there's people think this is rip-off of Babe, um, no it's not. Babe's not about a pig having to save his family, Gordy's not about a pig aspiring to become a sheepdog. They're different plots people! Plus Sleeping Beauty was A LOT like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, does that make it a rip-off too? And I already mentioned one reason why Lion King and Bambi are alike, but there's more. They both have the Circle of Life theme, they both have the protagonist as next in-line for the throne, they both have the antagonist kill the important parent, there's a fire in both movies, the hyenas assist Scar the same way Man is assisted by hunting dogs, they both have the protagonist fall in love with his childhood best friend, they both have epic battles (like when Scar fights Simba and Bambi fights Ronno), and they even both have the book ends trope! So yeah, you see what I mean? And yet NO ONE has accused Lion King as being a Bambi rip-off. Not that that's what I'm saying, but I'm saying they're more similar plot-wise than this is to Babe. And come on, even shows like Shake it Up and Dog with a Blog have higher ratings than Gordy. WHICH MAKES NO SENSE WHATSOEVER! I already wrote a review of Dog with a Blog explaining why it's awful and SHOULD have been canceled after the first season like Marvin Marvin. But no, they just HAD to renew it for a season season AND a third. It better not last longer than four seasons! If Gordy was a TV show I bet it'd be rated just as high as Regular Show. OK, I'm done with this before I exceed the 1,000 word limit.

There is nothing like watching Sunset Boulevard. It's a great movie that need to be in the center of attention. Name after a Boulevard in Los Angeles, this film noir was directed and co-written by Billy Wilder who destroy forever the iconic Hollywood image with his dark tale of greed, and the lust of everlasting fame. The film stars William Holden as Joe Gillis, an unsuccessful screenwriter who happen to come upon, a faded silent movie starlet, Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) who draws him into her fantasy world where she dreams of making a triumphant return to the screen. William Holden is great in the role as a man struggling to keep his masculinity. I like his moral decision in the end of the film. Serve them right. In a way, this movie was indeed William Holden comeback film as well as he fallen from the starlight after 1939's Golden Boys. Gloria Swanson is scary, charming and brilliant in the Femme fatale manipulative role. She does over act a bit, but that comes with the part. She's pretty much playing an extreme version of herself. Gloria, herself was trying to have a comeback with this film, after a number of fails films, include one with Director Erich von Stroheim in 1929's Queen Kelly. Art is mirroring real life, as Erich von Stroheim stars as Max Von Mayerling, her butler and the director that discovered her. There is even a chilling theater scene with all the main characters watching the film, Queen Kelly. Erich von Stroheim is just amazing in this film, and I have become a fan of his works. I didn't like Nancy Olson so much as Betty Schaefer as I felt she was way too chirpy for my taste and in your face shouting acting. I do like the silent film stars cameos like Director Cecil B. DeMille, Buster Keaton, H. B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson. I do like the cameo of the set of 1949's DeMille's Samson and Delilah. It makes the film seems more real to Hollywood, to know that another real life film was really taking place there. While, the characters could had been nearly unlikeable, Billy Wilder's comedy charm gives this movie some room to breathe. I have to praise the writing. It's amazing. Yes, some of the jokes went over my head, but the film was balance well enough for the drama and the comedy, not to feel overloaded. The narrative of film noirs are usually characterized as multifaceted and often confusing. It does commonly entailing the use of flashback and first-person voice-over narration. I'm pretty glad they open the film with the shot of the swimming pool, rather than having two corpses talking to each other at the morgue. I think it does sound stupid so I'm glad they use the dead body in the swimming pool idea. The corpse floating in the pool in the film's opening scene. The desired image proved difficult to achieve, and the problem was resolved by placing mirrors on the bottom of the swimming pool and filming from above. The underwater shot was pretty impressed at the time. The visual effects are amazing. Sunset Boulevard uses a lot of high-contrast lighting in Norma's house that creates dark shadows that works well. The lighting and the setting is to show the character is suffocating in their life. Norma is ever looking for the light. I love the foggy blur that it create when people get near it. It's symbolism at its best. The film also contains some German-expressionistic element such as the oblique vertical and horizontal angles. For some interior shots, the crew sprinkled dust in front of the camera before filming to suggest dirty or unclean. The house was old, and nice. The way the photographs were surrounding. It look like some odd Gothic church. The house was later used by Nicholas Ray's 1955's Rebel Without a Cause. It was pretty interesting. The score was composed by Franz Waxman was pretty good. Nothing worth noting compare to today's standards. It was just OK, at best for me. Here are some faults in the film in my opinion. The narrating goes a little bit too long. Show, don't tell. Plus, how do dead-men can do a narration anyways? Aren't they dead? The whole blooming Gillis-Betty relationship seem out of place as well. I know it's needed for the plot, but it's seem forced. I just don't see Betty having much interested in a man, she barely sees. The story was a bit influence by the real life tragedy of Mabel Normand and William Desmond Taylor, in which William Desmond got shot and killed. This film marks the first time that Hollywood was view in a negative light on film. The theme of this movie is that Hollywood creates dreams and stars, and then leaves them with nothing but their own outdated fantasies. In the other side of the coin, some people are so hungry for the fame, that they are willing to do anything for a shot at it, even destroying lives. Hollywood still love and hate the film for its criticism of the movie industry. It's still a bit controversial, ever today. Wilder show us the real Hollywood where few people had success and many fails. People mustn't starve for fame too long, else they risk being trapped in a world of their own making, a world where they become bitter and delude.

The characters are under-developed and their motivations are anyones' guess. The whole is deeply unsatisfying.

Despite some excellent cinematography, great sets and a (potentially) strong cast, the film is so weakly directed that it falls apart almost immediately. The cast is wasted. The plot is incongruous. The characters are under-developed and their motivations are anyones' guess. The whole is deeply unsatisfying. Of course, Barabara De Rossi is utterly gorgeous, Plummer has some gravitas and Kinski is OK, but without a firm hand at the rudder, we are on a gondola to nowhere.Only the film's few saving graces allowed me to watch to the end.

I also have to mention the final showdown between Stallone , Lithgow and the helicopter.Cliffhanger is directed with professionalism by Renny Harlin (Die hard 2) . The screenplay offers some nice laughs and twists. The whole movie is photographed well and looks good , even if sometimes it's obvious that some scenes were filmed in studio.

It also has a sad moment where Spock dies which is an example of tear-jerking. The script is smart and very inventive and the pacing is very good. The cast from the original film delivers a lot of solid performances especially William Shatner, Leonard Nemoy and Ricardo Montalban as Khan, who is downright creepy and frightening for a Star Trek villain. The scenery and visuals are wonderful to see, but the best part is the music score from James Horner, one of my favorite music composers. He has done some great work (including Apollo 13, Braveheart, Avatar, etc.) and his score for this film is no exception.Overall, Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan is a masterpiece and an epic continuation that saved the franchise back at the early 1980s.

Certainly something special for the novelty. It's perhaps the most inconsistent film I've ever seen. Some parts brilliant, some parts ludicrous. Poor execution or poor idea? I can't tell. According to Bruce Joel Robin, back in 1990, he was told Ghost was the best screenplay ever written in Hollywood. It was even awarded the Oscar. It doesn't receive that much acclaim nowadays, Pulp Fiction must've blown it out of the water and Hollywood begged for forgiveness from Casablanca. It now stands quite oddly, part dated (though I can forgive misguided special effects) and part beyond its time. It's like Michael Jackson's Thriller. A deliberately mixed bag with something for everyone. In Ghost, every character is perceived in tone and style through a different genre. There's romance, comedy, crime thriller, murder mystery and even a touch of horror. Unfortunately, this makes it wildly erratic. In fact, while its first few punchy moments showed promise, it's first half hour is an utter lame bore. There's a few setups that are intelligent in hindsight, but Patrick Swayze's poor acting betrays the material. Unconvincing isn't even the word. He's absolutely laughable, his reactions to things are pure parody. Its iconic moments feel ridiculous in context. The film doesn't start to get bearable until Whoopi Goldberg's appearance. She's surprisingly delightful, I always kinda doubted whether she deserves her acclaim, but she certainly does. Her addition gives the film an incredibly fascinating and entertaining dynamic. Makes it a much richer and immersive film. She always earned belly laughs with every joke. And the twists and turns keep coming at a Shakespearean rate with the amount of betrayal. Despite Swayze's acting, the emotion of the film works and its metaphysical ideas of life after death are easy to connect to and it ends wonderfully life-affirming.However, while its admirably ambitious to try and display different characters through different genres and weave between them, it does mean we get immersed in one side of the story story and have that dissatisfying feeling of being disconnected from others in the film. Then leave that character we were immersed in and that's dissatisfying. I'm not sure why it doesn't work emotionally as it's a pretty great idea from Rubin and Zucker. I can't help but wonder what this story would be like as a play. There were many times when I really wanted to break away from the camera's limited perspective and look at a different character. The stage would allow that freedom and it would be a richer experience. Though they'd have to figure out how to do the passing-through-objects convincingly. I know there's a musical but it's sentimental enough already. Regardless, this film was a huge success. Maybe we can call Ghost the most commercial script ever written instead.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 September 2013","score":"","review":" Ghost is a strange one.

Despite Swayze's acting, the emotion of the film works and its metaphysical ideas of life after death are easy to connect to and it ends wonderfully life-affirming.However, while its admirably ambitious to try and display different characters through different genres and weave between them, it does mean we get immersed in one side of the story story and have that dissatisfying feeling of being disconnected from others in the film. Then leave that character we were immersed in and that's dissatisfying. I'm not sure why it doesn't work emotionally as it's a pretty great idea from Rubin and Zucker. I can't help but wonder what this story would be like as a play. There were many times when I really wanted to break away from the camera's limited perspective and look at a different character. The stage would allow that freedom and it would be a richer experience. Though they'd have to figure out how to do the passing-through-objects convincingly.

Certainly something special for the novelty. It's perhaps the most inconsistent film I've ever seen. Some parts brilliant, some parts ludicrous. Poor execution or poor idea? I can't tell. According to Bruce Joel Robin, back in 1990, he was told Ghost was the best screenplay ever written in Hollywood. It was even awarded the Oscar. It doesn't receive that much acclaim nowadays, Pulp Fiction must've blown it out of the water and Hollywood begged for forgiveness from Casablanca. It now stands quite oddly, part dated (though I can forgive misguided special effects) and part beyond its time. It's like Michael Jackson's Thriller. A deliberately mixed bag with something for everyone. In Ghost, every character is perceived in tone and style through a different genre. There's romance, comedy, crime thriller, murder mystery and even a touch of horror. Unfortunately, this makes it wildly erratic. In fact, while its first few punchy moments showed promise, it's first half hour is an utter lame bore. There's a few setups that are intelligent in hindsight, but Patrick Swayze's poor acting betrays the material. Unconvincing isn't even the word. He's absolutely laughable, his reactions to things are pure parody. Its iconic moments feel ridiculous in context. The film doesn't start to get bearable until Whoopi Goldberg's appearance.

That's the question put forth by the intriguing and often overlooked film The Watcher in the Woods. Directed by John Hough, it's a movie from Disney's glory years and while it may not be quite as good as say Escape to Witch Mountain-also directed by Hough-the film does manage to weave a story that includes mystery, suspense, and magic that only the old school Disney can produce. In other words, it's the type of movie Disney hasn't made in years. Set in the seemly untouched English country side-a land rife with tales of strange occurrences-the story begins when Jan Curtis (the underrated Lynn-Holly Johnson) and her family move into large, old house owned by a reclusive woman named Mrs. Aylwood (the legendary Bette Davis). It doesn't take long for Jan and her little sister (the adorable Kyle Richards from Halloween and who guest stared many times on Little House on the Prarie ) to realize that there are some strange forces at work and it all leads back to the strange disappearance of Mrs. Aylwood's daughter, Karen. What happened to Karen during that strange ritual carried out by her friends? Is Karen trapped somehow, somewhere? Is she the watcher in the woods or is it, something else? And what does all this have to do with the upcoming equinox? It's these questions and the effective techniques used by the filmmakers that make The Watcher what it is. Granted, the movie does have its faults, such as the fact that Jan's dad (the charming David McCallum) seems to disappear halfway through the film and a few inconsistencies with the story ( I suspect this may be due to having to re shoot new endings after the original failed to please target audiences. You can see the original endings on the DVD). But the film more than makes up for this with the chemistry between Johnson and Richards, the performance of the late, great Bette Davis who ,although in her seventies at this point, still had it as well as effective music that manages to be both haunting and beautiful. It's a type of movie that you wish Disney still made. Sure, every now and then Disney might turn out a good one like Wreck It Ralph(when they're not buying every entertainment franchise known to man!). But there can be no question that the glory days of rich story telling from Disney are over, probably forever now that the accountants run the show. Luckily, the movie is on DVD-the only way you can see it now a days since I've never seen it on TV before-so I implore you find it and seek it out the answers to The Watcher in the Woods.

And this is why parody generally provides the cleverest films, mocking the archetypes over-exploited by lazy directors with a subtle, and so engaging, wink to the audience.And Last Action Hero parodies the action-flick, featuring its most iconic ambassador, Arnold Schwarzenegger as the lone-ranger bad-ass cigar-smoking titular hero of a never-ending franchise Jack Slater. As if he was plenty aware that Die Hard put a deathblow on the credibility of such super-heroic figures popularized by Commando and Predator, John McTiernan becomes the iconoclast of his own creations -a demonstration of smart sense of humor a few directors ever achieved.The opening Jack Slater film even concludes with a reference to the genre-defining Die Hard, using the same score to contribute to the whole 'inside joke' effect, completed when Jack Slater becomes a movie-within-a-movie character, from the perspective of Danny, his number one fan, played by Austin O'Brien. Basically, Danny is to Last Action Hero what Cecilia (Mia Farrow) was to The Purple Rose of Cairo a movie lover whose only means to transcend routine's banality was a constant ecstatic stare toward the silver screen. And being a kid of the early 90's, I could only respond to his hypnotic fascination.Action films are indeed the best pop-culture fillers, crystallizing the most common denominators of fun and entertainment and generating codes and formula that are part of cinema's timeless and universal heritage, no matter how overused they are the never-dying hero, the yelling superior, the revenge plot, the villainous monologue, the sexy daughter, the comic-relief sidekick, the sophisticated boss' right hand who becomes the real villain and a lame catchphrase. They're all there in Last Action Hero less because they're obligatory but for the necessity to turn them into derision, by confronting them to reality.Still, there has to be some fantasy in this reality Danny is given by the projectionist Nick (Art Carney) a magic ticket that belonged to the Great Houdini. And while he watches the fourth opus of Jack Slater's adventures during a private screening, the ticket glows, sticks of dynamite are thrown from the screen and land near his feet. Danny starts to take the notion of 'danger' less cynically before the explosion immediately projects him into his hero's universe. The film's greatest moments come from Danny's desperate attempts to convince Slater that they live in a movie where phone numbers start with 555, video-store workers are sexy and profanity is prohibited. Hell, in this parallel universe, his own rival Stallone played the Terminator roles (which made me wonder who then played Rocky or Rambo).The film recycles every cliché in such an over-the-top way it's hilarious the car rams into an ice cream truck and explodes, a henchman gets an ice cone on the neck, many gags feel like these 'McBain' segments from The Simpsons, thus never fail. The film also features one hilarious modernization of Hamlet and two delightful movie references. One of Slater's friends is played by F. Murray Abraham, naturally, Danny warns him that it's the same guy who killed Mozart in Amadeus the film that got 8 Oscars. For a kid, he has the knowledge of an IMDb user, which says a lot about Last Action Hero exhilarating effect as pure geek escapism, reinforced by the obscure intrusion of Death from The Seventh Seal, a joke I didn't even get when I saw the film as a teenager.Now, there are two facts regarding Last Action Hero the film flopped, and it didn't deserve to, not when box-office laws are governed by rules that allow Cliffhanger to be the 7th highest grossing film anyway. Therefore, I can only qualify its bombing as 'accidental', the same accident that made Sorcerer flop in 1977. The parallel is all the more eloquent because Last Action Hero suffered from an ill-fated opening coinciding with the big event of 1993 the release of Steven Spielberg's Jurassik park (Sorcerer had it worse with Star Wars) and perhaps misleading title, trailer and word-of-mouth that branded the film in the total opposite way it expected to a dumb action film, 'another one'.I don't blame the viewers who thought a bunch of reptilian carnivores would be a fresher spectacle, I, was misled too, the first time I saw the TV announcement. But being a box-office flop is one thing, but when I started to examine the disastrous reception &#x96;from those who actually saw the film- I was stunned. Seriously, what's with all these Razzies' nominations? Worst actor? Arnold had to play his usual role. Worst screenplay? Check the review's title. Worst new star?

Basically, Danny is to Last Action Hero what Cecilia (Mia Farrow) was to The Purple Rose of Cairo a movie lover whose only means to transcend routine's banality was a constant ecstatic stare toward the silver screen. And being a kid of the early 90's, I could only respond to his hypnotic fascination.Action films are indeed the best pop-culture fillers, crystallizing the most common denominators of fun and entertainment and generating codes and formula that are part of cinema's timeless and universal heritage, no matter how overused they are the never-dying hero, the yelling superior, the revenge plot, the villainous monologue, the sexy daughter, the comic-relief sidekick, the sophisticated boss' right hand who becomes the real villain and a lame catchphrase. They're all there in Last Action Hero less because they're obligatory but for the necessity to turn them into derision, by confronting them to reality.Still, there has to be some fantasy in this reality Danny is given by the projectionist Nick (Art Carney) a magic ticket that belonged to the Great Houdini. And while he watches the fourth opus of Jack Slater's adventures during a private screening, the ticket glows, sticks of dynamite are thrown from the screen and land near his feet. Danny starts to take the notion of 'danger' less cynically before the explosion immediately projects him into his hero's universe. The film's greatest moments come from Danny's desperate attempts to convince Slater that they live in a movie where phone numbers start with 555, video-store workers are sexy and profanity is prohibited. Hell, in this parallel universe, his own rival Stallone played the Terminator roles (which made me wonder who then played Rocky or Rambo).The film recycles every cliché in such an over-the-top way it's hilarious the car rams into an ice cream truck and explodes, a henchman gets an ice cone on the neck, many gags feel like these 'McBain' segments from The Simpsons, thus never fail. The film also features one hilarious modernization of Hamlet and two delightful movie references. One of Slater's friends is played by F. Murray Abraham, naturally, Danny warns him that it's the same guy who killed Mozart in Amadeus the film that got 8 Oscars. For a kid, he has the knowledge of an IMDb user, which says a lot about Last Action Hero exhilarating effect as pure geek escapism, reinforced by the obscure intrusion of Death from The Seventh Seal, a joke I didn't even get when I saw the film as a teenager.Now, there are two facts regarding Last Action Hero the film flopped, and it didn't deserve to, not when box-office laws are governed by rules that allow Cliffhanger to be the 7th highest grossing film anyway. Therefore, I can only qualify its bombing as 'accidental', the same accident that made Sorcerer flop in 1977. The parallel is all the more eloquent because Last Action Hero suffered from an ill-fated opening coinciding with the big event of 1993 the release of Steven Spielberg's Jurassik park (Sorcerer had it worse with Star Wars) and perhaps misleading title, trailer and word-of-mouth that branded the film in the total opposite way it expected to a dumb action film, 'another one'.I don't blame the viewers who thought a bunch of reptilian carnivores would be a fresher spectacle, I, was misled too, the first time I saw the TV announcement. But being a box-office flop is one thing, but when I started to examine the disastrous reception &#x96;from those who actually saw the film- I was stunned. Seriously, what's with all these Razzies' nominations? Worst actor? Arnold had to play his usual role. Worst screenplay? Check the review's title. Worst new star?

Despite working all day, they never seem to be able to get ahead. They eat frugally and Emily makes her own clothes from patterns with cheap cloth.Suddenly, out of the blue, a wealthy uncle (I wish I had a wealthy uncle out of the blue) decides not to make Fred and Emily wait until he dies. He gives them enough money to travel the world and, for a time, break Fred out of the dreary office routine (rich uncle, where are you?).First, they go to Paris, where they live the high life. Then they ship off on a long cruise.Fred is not a good sailor, and this leads to some excellent touches in the first half. While Emily enjoys herself on board, Hitchcock makes unexpected, and hilarious, jump-cuts to Fred ill in bed. A great moment in early Hitchcock is when the terribly seasick Fred is presented with the ship's menu. It lasts only a few seconds, but it's worth the wait.The tension (in the movie and between Fred and Emily) builds when Emily meets a Commander who is smitten with her. Again, Hitchcock's humor shines through. The Commander always seems at a loss for words and Emily is forever interrupting him. Eventually she compliments him by telling him he's easy to talk to. After Fred finds his sea legs, he meets a Princess inexplicably smitten with him -- or is it his money? Fred's romance with the Princess is the silly side of infidelity; but when Emily begins returning the Commander's affection, it looks like coming into money destroyed Fred and Emily's marriage.One charm of Rich and Strange is that, though it's a talkie all the way through, Hitchcock has inserted titles between the scenes, as in the silent movie days, making a droll running commentary on Fred and Emily's new life.The problem is, about the half-way mark, Rich and Strange (sometimes going under the romantic alias East of Shanghai) feels like it's stretching out. I don't know if Hitchcock got bored with it, but I certainly did. When Fred and Emily were stranded alone on a sinking ship I hoped they would go down with it. But even at that point, I had a lot of movie to go.Hitchcock made few straight comedies. Mr. and Mrs. Smith (1941) is another wry take on marriage benefiting from the considerable talents of Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery. The under-appreciated The Trouble with Harry is a romantic comedy with couples brought together by an inconveniently dead body. Despite having a great sense of humor that followed Hitchcock through his television show and right up to his last movie (Family Plot), his comedies (even Harry) have soggy bottoms. Hitchcock is really at the top of his game when his dark comic sensibility creeps into movies of almost unbearable suspense. When Rich and Strange begins to sound melodramatic, I had a sense Hitchcock felt (pardon the pun) all at sea.Nevertheless, for a Hitchcock completist, this film is a must. It has wonderful touches here and there.
